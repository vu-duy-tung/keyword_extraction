The service was good our waiter was extra nice so I didn't complain to him but I couldn't believe when I saw that the salmon I ordered came with pieces of sausage, it disgusted me . As an Italian I never seen something like that , we never mix meat with fish , it doesn't match. The restaurants in Italy mostly specialize  in serving only 100% sea food menu or 100% meat menu . The other things we ordered are not worth mentioning , the food is just not good .",

I believe I only seen one server working though, because a man in a suit was trying to help out. I can guess that was the manager of the restaurant.   So service was slow because of the lack of help.   I ordered the Tomato Basil soup. It took about 20 minutes and I practically ate all my bread. The soup arrive and it was delicious!   How do I feel right now, as I type this? Extremely tired.  Bad sign, because that means it was filled with sugar. I got a headache, along with the tired feeling.   I won't eat there again because sugar is awful for you and also feeling like this sucks. Hope restaurants jump on the healthy train soon...  :-(",

Inside outside seating int he mall the Fountains of the Gods drowns out whatever noise there is as the people watching make this place a don't miss regardless.

Mozerella Fritta 3 large deep fried pieces of mozerella with marinara sauce .. Tasty but no where near enough sauce.   1 cheese pizza quite tasty with a very thin crust.   Positives all the meals were good in quality and very tasty.   negatives waiter was in the weeds - no bread offered - Refills on drinks and took forever to get the check..  Other negative was food was lukewarm to cold yet served quickly which makes no sense.  Probably 2.5 stars here but certainly nothing bad just average.",

I also decided to order a small Ceasar salad, which was really tiny and the greens were not even that fresh, but they charge you entree price for that thing!  Service was slow and not that great.

I had my wedding reception at Trevi (they have a private group area on the second floor) on 11/12/16 and everything was PERFECT! The space was large enough for a DJ and dance floor, and Trevi staff decorated the room and all of the tables for us ahead of time after we provided the decor/centerpieces. The reception was for 70 people (although we were told the room could accommodate around 100), and everyone raved about the food, the service (not just how quickly staff responded to requests but also how friendly they were) and the ambiance. Seriously, we had guests tell us this was the best meal they had ever had at a wedding! Everything came out super hot and exactly as ordered (guests chose from 4 entre' options). We even had a private bar, and the bar tender was awesome. I can't say enough good things about Trevi and its staff, especially manager Michelle, she is absolutely amazing!!!Trevi made my wedding night the best, most fun and romantic night of my entire life!",

The only problem we have is they have happy hour but you have to drink at their little bar area only to get the happy hour drink prices. That should be good for the whole place not just the little bar area. ALSO we may not go back as they used to have a locals discount, when we asked for it this time we were told it EXPIRED! How does a local discount expire? We live here, if you want us to eat there and bring friends who visit gives us locals, a little incentive please! We have too many other restaurant choices!!

    "text": "My cousin had a rehearsal dinner at Trevi day before the wedding. Our group was seated on one side of the 2nd floor and I think there was about 20-25 of us. On the other side of us, there was a wedding party of 25-30 as well so it worked out well with only 2 groups on the 2nd floor.  We had a 4 course pre-set meal which was, soup, salad, an entree and dessert. The soup was okay but needed more flavor, I forgot the type of salad we had because I was already into by 2nd grey goose and cranberry drink but it was good. For an entree we had 3 pastas to choose from and I choose the Rigatoni Bolognese and was very hearty and delicous. I didn't finish it because it was a lot.  Overall the restaurant ambiance was great and the server kept coming by to refill my grey goose and cranberry. I loved the 2nd floor semi private area, it wasn't too noisy or cramped and had a great time. If I ever get married in Vegas, I'd have my rehearsal dinner or mini wedding reception here.",

    "text": "It you want cheap (by Vegas standards), convenient food with good people watching, this is your place. But, do not expect the food to be flavorful or the usual quality you would get for the price.   I ordered a standard margherita pizza ($14) and a caprese bloody mary ($10). I was happy with both, especially the bloody mary. It was bloody awesome!  My friend ordered the linguine vongole ($25, linguine with steamed clams) and was very unhappy with it. She said it had no flavor and was not worth the price. Perhaps sticking with simple dishes and keeping your standards low is the best strategy at this restaurant.  The service was fine. Nothing special, but not sub-par either. For the price, convenience, and people watching, this restaurant suited my needs.   In response to an earlier review, I had a drink in hand coming into the restaurant and the hostess said nothing about it.   My final comment is that Caesar's Palace has many fountains paying tribute to the famous Trevi Fountain (including the fountain outside this restaurant), however this fountain was clearly not built in the time of Caesar. Beware of these and other historical inaccuracies in the theming of the palace!",

Our server Tim was very friendly and attentive. We were ver happy with our service. The food, which is what we care for was absolutely AMAZING. For appetizers, we had the Mozzarellas and they were diving. For our entree I had the Spaghetti and my bf had the Raviolis. Our meals were sensational, the sauce was by far the best part. We are Italian food lovers and we are constantly trying new Italian restaurants and this has made it into our top three. For dessert we had A Gelati Split, which was really good also. Plates were decently priced; overall it was one of the best meals we had on the trip and we saw it to be worth every penny.",

It was good he said but way to many tomatoes for some one who doesn't like tomatoes. Service was great. Waitress was very friendly.

Michelle was beyond incredible as our reception coordinator.  Trust me, I spoke with a few and it was unreal how well she listened and got together a package for exactly what I wanted.  She was ALWAYS quick to respond no matter how many emails she received from me and was the most pleasant, kind person I could have asked for when dealing with something stressful like wedding planning.  I unfortunately had people from 4 days to 4 hours before my wedding cancel and was fortunately able to have an employee get a hold of Michelle for me (it was on a Sunday so she wasn't scheduled to be in until my event) and she IMMEDIATELY called me back, jot down everything I said and ALL of the changes were made when I arrived exactly how I wanted them.    The food was exceptional.  Our steaks were cooked PERFECTLY and everyone who had the chicken and pasta raved about it all.  You also can't go wrong with tiramisu  :)    Everything was presented elegantly and it did not feel like a 'restaurant' atmosphere at all.  Michelle also thankfully was able to help place the favors and some of the decor for us on the day of the wedding as well. We had a DJ and our party was so much fun that the bride and bridesmaids from the quieter reception going on in the restaurant downstairs came running up to sing and dance with us LOL!  It was an amazing time and I will always be grateful to Michelle for all she did for me and for making it so easy when you don't know what to expect. She was attentive, caring and great at keeping me calm and comfortable all the way through. It couldn't have been more perfect.",

    "text": "Trevi is an excellent italian restaurant in Caesars Palace. Don't be confused by the sky-roof picture and end up at Venetian like we did. They also have a gelato stand on one end of the restaurant.  Ambiance & Decor: 5* It's beautifully decorated, and has an indoor section as well as a pseudo-patio section outside along the forum shops. The outdoor section is adjascent to a large fountain giving it a nice ambiance. It's pretty casual here, and the outside section is great for people watching. The place is really huge, so even on a busy night, they can accommodate groups.  Food & Drinks: 4* Most of the food we had was stellar. The margarita pizza here is superb, and absolutely recommended. We had a couple of pastas, most of which were excellent. The desserts and gelato were really good too. The drinks on the other hand weren't that great. We tried some of their signature cocktails, and they were just meh, nothing special and definitely not worth the cost.   Service: 3.5* The servers are friendly, but the service is slow here. There was just one server who was handling the entire outside section, and took a while to take our orders and get the food out, even though it wasn't crowded. Also, before bringing out the check, the server loudly asked us for a tip %, instead of swiping our cards and having us enter it on the receipt, which I found weird and unprofessional.  The prices here are on the higher end. The food is definitely worth the high prices, but I won't say the same about the drinks. I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to eat at this place for quite awhile, and finally made it. We had a group of people visiting from out of town wanting to go to the strip for dinner and Caesar's Palace is one of my favorite casinos. We came on Thursday early evening and there were open tables so our party was seated right away. We were given some bread and oil as free appetizers. We did ask for some vinegar to mix with the oil which they gladly gave. My husband and I both ordered the frutti de mare since we are seafood lovers. The pasta came out and it was DELICIOUS! It had plenty of seafood- scallops, shrimp, lobster and mussels, and the garlic cream sauce was on point. This restaurant is also located inside The Forum Shops, and is literally next to the fountains so you have a nice ambiance. It is a bit loud due to the fountains, but that wasn't a problem for us. We also have a Landry's card, which was worth the $25 membership because we use it so frequently that we've racked up so many points that we were able to redeem our $25 rewards here- only downside is that they don't include the alcohol. We will definitely be back!",

He came back with another bottle which he recommended and in order to \"make things up\" gave us a nice pour. The table is set with olive oil, and balsamic vinegar to go with their oven fresh bread rolls. We shared a Margherita pizza with prosciutto and a caprese salad. The salad came with fresh Burata Mozzarella. The pizza crust was thin and wonderful with just a hint of sauce among all the cheese.

The food is always good but not something overly special but better than going to he Cheesecake Factory right down the mall.   I had he Romano Chicken salad today and it was delicious. Just  the right size for lunch and the crispy chicken cutlet was Cooke perfectly and well seasoned.

It wasn't bad, but for $20-30 per plate I better leave thinking \"yeah, this was better than Secret Pizza/Holesteins/ any other great and cheaper places of this strip.\" -SCAM ALERT: Our server worked overtime to sell us on this Landry's VIP Dining Card. We asked him several times  how much it would cost and he said nothing. Guess what? $25 was added to our bill to cover the membership. Luckily the manager took it off our bill and took back the membership.   Pros: -Centrally located. The patio is technically indoors but has nice ambiance and would be good for a day with poor weather.  -Wine by the glass prices were very reasonable  -Easy to make a reservation although one wasn't necessary. This would be a good last-minute dinner place.",

He just got more and more aggravated as the night went on. We ordered 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 5 entrees, it's not like we weren't spending any money. He rarely checked up on us, rolled eyes at us if we asked questions, and even checked his phone while taking our orders.

    "text": "The Trevi restaurant is blessed with a setting suitable to its name: adjacent to Caesar's beautiful Trevi fountain. \"Outdoor\" seating is available next to the fountain, which can make for a memorable dinner. My wife and I still fondly remember our prior dinner here, more than 10 years ago.  So on our recent Vegas trip we came back for a return visit. We were reluctant, however, to blow our budget on yet another high-priced Strip dinner. We were delighted to discover that Trevi's as an option for more budget-minded diners: a pair of weekly specials. I had the Pizza of the Month (cheese and sausage) for $9.99, and my wife had the weekly sandwich special, a custom-roasted hamburger.   We were not expecting anything special from pizza and hamburgers, but were pleasantly surprised what a top chef can do to everyday fare. The hamburger and pizza were fantastic, so good that they almost needed a new name - they were so far and above what we have come to associate with these items! So if you are on a budget it's worth checking out these weekly specials.  Service was also top-notch, best we experienced during our week in Vegas, albeit with one exception cited below. Our server was extremely pleasant and personable, offered excellent suggestions and her service made for a wonderful dinner.  However, I must point out one negative: towards the end of the meal we were hit up to purchase a card good at Morton's restaurants across the country, offering discount meals, for an upfront $25. Perhaps a good deal for some, but not us; there were few of these restaurants in our local area. Still, our server mentioned this twice, and the manager actually came to our table to give us a 5+ minute spiel himself. The sales tactics are overly intrusive, and should be pared back to a short intro and a brochure. I'm deducting one star purely for this.",

It's that restaurant you always walk by when you're in Caesars shopping areas and wonder, how is that restaurant? I ordered the PARMIGIANA EGGPLANT and it was good, but nothing that was amazing. I wanted to love the dish, but it was just mediocre. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish. I'd definitely give this restaurant another and try something different. ENJOY!",

    "text": "I really enjoyed dining at Trevi. Any restaurant situated in this setting will undoubtedly provide a fantastic dining experience.  We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and the service was impressively quick (even with a nearly full house). Our waiter did their job but was unengaging and mainly played the role of an order taker. They weren't rude in any way, but this slightly took away from the experience.  For starters, we had the bacon wrapped chicken meatballs, which come on a platter of 3. My expectations were high, but the  flavor underwhelmed (the bacon was hardly noticeable). The food got better from there. The spaghetti and meatballs was great and the sauce had both a zesty and sweet component. The sausage and pepper pizza was satisfying but could have used a little more of a kick.  Overall, I would recommend Trevi as a good family dining experience for its relatively inexpensive food (for the Strip) and the surrounding scenery.",

We were late for our 4.45 reservation and arrived at 5.00 Pm instead. But Trevi still keep our table intact and very warm in welcoming us, the late guests. We sat down and inform Tony right away that we have to be in n out in an hour because we have a circque du soleil to attend to.  He smile and said U got the best server for the job with a little wink.   He proceeds to grab our food order first followed with our drinks. By the time he drop our drinks and 2 bottles of wine, all the appetisers and salad has arrived. Within 10 minutes of devouring our salad and appetisers, all our main course arrive and we had a hell of a time. He check back and top our wine glass while checking if everything alright. He timed it so well that one of my friends suggested him to open his own restaurant. LOL.   Anyway, we finished our meal and he even had the time to gave us a huge banana split for my sister birthday and even take our picture.  Thanks Trevi for wonderful service and that awesome Linguini Al Fruti Di Mare. I shall check back in again next year!",

All other staff members were very pleasant to work with as well.  The food came out quickly, and was delicious.  We ordered the salmon(which was slightly over cooked but still tasty), and the lasagne.  We ordered bottled water, and they always made sure to keep our glasses refilled from the bottle.  I do think sitting on the patio area would have been very loud, so I was glad they had an area \"inside\". When I say patio, I mean the open air seating area exposed to the mall. The bread was really good also.  They do serve coke products unlike most of Vegas(which I was very happy about!) I would happily eat here again!",

I know Vegas is expensive, I know but they overcharged me ridiculously.   I ordered their chicken meatball soup and their mixed green salad. I wanted some mozzarella cheese on it and the server said no problem.   The chicken meatball soup was very hearty and fresh. Sadly, there was only one chicken meatball. I didn't think it'd be that huge either. My salad was fresh too. The mozzarella smelled a little but I thought it could just be the brand of the buffalo mozzarella. I only had 1/4 of a small tomato in my salad.   Why did I mention the 1/4 of the tomato? Well, you see my bill came out to be $30 (rounded up, tip not included). For a side salad and soup!? The salad was $7.95 and they charged me $5 for 3 pieces of cheese AND $2 for the tomato. I never requested for tomato...and if you're going to charge me put the whole damn tomato not 1/4 of it (or at least  half of it...). I love this place but that was way too much for a soup and salad, even for Vegas. If my bill was max $25 with tip included I think it would've been more reasonable. I've been to other gourmet restaurants in Vegas and had a legit entree and would pay $30 dollars for food. Not soup and salad.",

A friend of mine introduced me to Trevi several years ago and since then I have dinner there one night each time I go to Vegas and everyone I have ever taken there loves it. The ambience is quite nice, in the Forum Shops next to the fountain and I always make a reservation ahead of time and request Fountain side seating and they are always able to accommodate.  They start out serving bread and olive oil, which is a nice authentic Italian start. Over the years we have tried the pizza, pasta, salads, appetizers, soups, and desserts and have never been disappointed. And their meatballs are delicious! Our most recent visit, just last night, was quite lovely as always. It started out a little rocky when I was told that one of my favorite menu items was no longer available ala carte; however our server, Rafael, \"made it happen\" and was able to accommodate the order, which I really appreciated.  We were celebrating two birthdays and they brought out gelato with a birthday candle for each, which was a nice touch.   I would definitely recommend giving Trevi a try!",

    "text": "Two of us stopped in for drinks because Mesa said that they were open for drinks but we would have to wait. We picked this place because they had a Happy Hour sign out front, but the bartender advised that they don't have HH on Saturdays. Why the sign, then? We didn't appreciate the bait-and-switch, but were tired at that point so we didn't want to schlep around trying to find a bar that did.  I ordered my cocktail on the rocks but it came straight up. It was a small pour; the glass could have held at least another ounce of liquid. My companion's was presented in an equally stingy fashion. When paying for drinks in Vegas (his choice, not mine; I prefer free cocktails while gambling), I expect them to be substantial.   The bar portion looks directly into the Forum Shops, so it's as loud as you would expect it to be. It's near the Fountain of the Gods (and not \"Fountain of the God's\" as indicated on their website).  Open for lunch, dinner, and afternoon cocktails.",

And it's the advent of the selfie stick that makes me almost.... jubilant, that the end is nigh. Let's hope the apes make something better of the planet!!  Trevi is a great place for people watching, and for no extra cost you get the benefit of people smelling, too. Yes, sit and eat some Italian, most likely imbibe, whilst watching the endless droves of tourists whip out their selfie sticks and their smart phones to take a picture of themselves in front of the Trevi.... fountain. Saying that almost feels sacrilegious!!  I've walked past this place numerous times over the years, not sure if it was always Trevi. Never seriously considered eating here though. Spago was my Forum Shops favorite, having some fond memories from dining there, but when I found it closed, and having just got into town, and a bit hungry, decided to give Trevi a shot. The location is fun, though I think I'd sit inside next time.   Service was fine, but the food was rather average. My wife was disappointed with her frutti di mare. The prices were certainly Vegas. Basically, it turned out to be what, in reality, it truly is: a mall food court meal.   Arrivederci Spago!! I shall miss you!!",

We arrived around 9pm and even then the restaurant was busy, but the crowds quickly dissipated.    We sat at one of the lounge tables and found service to be fairly prompt. Check out the happy hour menu for some great drink prices, including a $4 bellini.  RECOMMENDED STARTERS: -Fried eggplant -Fried Calamari -Bruschetta (my fav!) - Meatballs  (so moist and tender) - Meatball sliders  RECOMMENDED DINNER PLATES  -Italian chopped salad - Gnocchi - ravioli  -Shrimp pasta  I only spent $30 for a drink, an appetizer, and a dinner salad. Not bad at all!",

We were seated promptly at our reservation time and our server, Eddie was out of this world excellent! The little things like having the chef split our meal and present it on two small plates, the offering additional bread to accompany our leftovers and even offering a special dessert which was amazing as well.   Oh, for the record we had the Capellini Bianco. The portion was more than enough for us to split and it was BANGARANG!   I don't drop my Hook-reference on just any meal, but this dish, filled with crab and shrimp was completely worth it!  We will definitely revisit Trevo again in the future!",

It wasn't busy on a Thursday night at 10pm, so we were seated near the fountain outside on the indoor patio. Service was excellent, and the food was very good.   I had the Costolo Breve, braised boneless short rib, my nephew had a short rib special that I can't remember the name of, and his wife enjoyed the Linguini al frutti di mare. All were delicious and all got eaten to completion. I wish I took photos but the drinking before and during the show made me forget! Well presented though.   I would definitely come back and eat here. Large selection of items to choose from. Solid 4.5 stars from me.",

We did have a little hiccup when we first arrived. We made reservations for 4 people well ahead of time and they wanted to seat us out on the Terrace in the center of Caesar's Forum Shops. It was so loud out there that I requested a seat inside the restaurant and it seemed like it was a major inconvenience to them. This could have been a 5 star review had this not happened.   We ended up in a very nice booth with Roofus as our waiter and we lucked out! Not only was the food excellent, our waiter was fabulous!! So attentive, kind and helpful with recommendations. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed.   The food? Crazy delicious! Everyone had a fabulous meal. The Cozze Marechiaro was unreal as well as the Mozzarella in Padella to start. The rest of the meal was just as great. I had the Ravioli alla Vodka and was a very happy girl.   This will be one of those places on our 'must do' list while in Vegas.",

He treated us like we were guests in his home rather than customers in a restaurant. I can't say enough about how great he was. In a town where it can seem like restaurants just want to get folks in and out to turn over the tables, Dan made us feel welcome and relaxed. This guy needs to put on a seminar for servers.

The calamari appetizer was among the best squid I ever did. Four different entrees were enjoyed: fettuccini Bolognese, linguini vongole with white sauce, capellini with seafood, Alfredo pollo carbonara. Each was fantastic on their own unique way.

My husband and I are members of the Landry club- which seriously pays for itself and we have enjoyed the rewards and birthday gifts off this card! The food here is unbeatable and service is wonderful- this time we had Arturo and he was prompt, service oriented and really took the time and effort to make our visit wonderful! We call this our Vegas secret. 15 years later we are here and the restaurant is still as good as ever! Highly recommend you to go to our Vegas secret- sit in the patio area!",

On a positive note, this is a great location for grabbing dinner prior to a show at the Colosseum. I must admit that this most recent visit was nowhere near as pleasant as my first.   We had reservations for a party of 5 at 6pm on a Saturday night. When we arrived our table was ready and we were sat quickly. Our waiter was quickly present to take our drink order but after that he was difficult to catch. He was always in the vicinity but was more concerned with another table than us. When he was present, he was short and somewhat rude.   I will say the food was great; I had the special, corn and polenta ravioli with crab and shrimp.   Based on this experience, what was a 4 star experience, dropped to 3 stars and the only thing keeping them from a 2 is that the food was great.",

I was in the mood for some Italian and we checked out this place because we were shopping around in the Forum.  We chose to be seated at the bar, we usually prefer to sit at the bar, it makes for more of a fun experience.   We split the calamari, ceasar salad and stuffed eggplant. Even though we split everything, it was A LOT of food. We looked around and we saw that the rest of the dishes that everyone else had were decent sized as well. The calamari was breaded perfectly and the dipping sauce was tasty. The ceasar was yummy but a little messy because the croutons were HUGE.  The stuffed eggplant was pretty good, the past inside was yummy but the eggplant was overcooked a bit, it didn't bother me too much because by that time I was too full to eat any of it.   It was a good meal for the price. I just decided to drink $20 worth of wine, which is very easy to do in an italian joint and in Vegas. I would go back again especially to try some of that gelato to go.",

But it's not that bad. You are able to have a conversation with out the whole restaurant hearing you.  I also loved the shopping around it.

Having walked by this restaurant countless times over the years, we finally decided to try.  I was starving as it was close to 2 pm and only had coffee and a danish for breakfast.  Not sure why I chose the chicken burger special but according to the waiter it was awesome.  It arrived and looked ok ... knew it would be ground chicken meat (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aQab9yLDDP_R9ZgRDt7MfA?select=G0sFpyrVp_EIrj4KdG8CHg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aQab...</a>).  Took a few bites and realized that this dish was going to be tossed away.  The ground chicken was mixed with tons of rosemary which is all I could taste.  The burger was topped with bbq sauce and bacon strips but all I could taste was the rosemeary.  After only eating half of the burger, I called it quits.  Again not sure why I decided to go with the chicken burger and should've just ordered a pizza.",

    "text": "Time Out - shame on you! The trusty city guide Time Out gives Trevi a top write-up. And with literally 100's of Italian restaurants in Las Vegas from which to choose, why not believe them? Mistake.   With outdoor temperatures running at about 38* C, it seemed like a good option to seek out the air-conditioned luxury of one of Vegas' top Malls to have lunch. Las Vegas, as you know, is fantasyville, a kitsch creation where the splendours of the World are brought to life in a never-ending series of cloned buildings, monuments and other landmarks. Trevi itself sits alongside a life-size reproduction of the Fontana di Trevi in Rome.   The menu offered recognisable delights from Italy: Antipasto Misto, Fritto Misto, Risotto, Pizza, Liguine with clams, Scalloppine, Tiramisu, Sorbetti. And there the resemblance to Italian food finished. The proscuitto was pre-sliced - days ago, it seemed - and dull red instead of pink; the roasted vegetables had been pickled; olives were out of a jar. The pasta was dried and tasteless - industrial quality when for $25 a plate you'd have expected freshly made. Pasta had been dropped straight into its sauce, water and all, so that the sauce became a light water-based emulsion. Clams and prawns had definitely been frozen at some stage of their existence.   I had a little word with the manager, Marcello. Good name, I thought, he'll sympathise with me. Marcello turned out to be Mexican, as were his chefs. That explained why the sous-chef who brought me my pasta and clams offered to sprinkle it with parmesan cheese! Marcello knocked 50% off the bill, but I'd rather have had decent food than a discount.   Just as well the Mafia no longer run Vegas, because if they'd gone to Trevi they'd have blown it up.",

That's totally fine, but don't have a huge sign advertising it and don't be condescending to your customers as a result!

We had a choice to either sit outside to people watch around the forum or go inside with a darker ambiance. We chose to sit outside by a replica of Trevi Fountain and people watch tourists take pictures and pass by.  We tried the Calamari Fritti to start and it was delicious! Our waiter was very informative and said that they dip the Calamari in milk which makes it less chewy.  The marinara/bolognese sauce they used for the calamari was on point too!  My Uncle tried the Capri Coral Crush, He loved it! It came in a martini glass but was like a smoothie. It was a great mango-alcoholic drink!  I ended up ordering a nice glass of Merlot to compliment my meal.  For my main course I ordered the LINGUINE AI FRUTTI DI MARE and it was to die for! It was a huge portion and was so good that I was able to finish it! The Linguine comes with lobster, scallops, shrimp, tomatoes and this excellent fettucine like sauce! Definately could see why it was their signature dish!  My Uncle got the chef's special, kind of like a seafood stew with clams, lobster, scallops and shimp which was in some sort of broth. It was kind of like Vuyabase (sorry for the lack of spelling) He loved it!  Since it was his birthday, they brought out complimentary cheesecake and gave him the choice of that or chocolate cake! That was nice of them to bring it out with a candle lit!  The servers were very cordial and informative and I am definately planning on going back! The only downside is if you're a TOTAL REWARDS member which is the player's card for Caesar's Palace, You can't use your value credits to pay for the meal. Other than that, decent prices for Vegas, about a $100 bucks for the two of us but a very nice meal! GO FOR IT!  I give it 4.0 HEATS out of 5!",

The waits can be somewhat on the long side, but there are lots to do in the forum shops while you wait, so I don't mind.   They have amazing calamari. I am kind of in awe of how fresh it tastes. Their pizzas are very nice as well. They're very thin crust, and they can be shared with another person. They have an assortment of pasta dishes as well which aren't as good as the pizza or calamari, but I still think they're okay... nothing too special. Their Italian sodas are very tasty and a good way to wash down all of the food.  The food is a little on the expensive side, but for dining fountainside and being on the strip, it's not bad at all. I have been to Trevi so many times, and I will be back for many more.",

We've ordered the lasagna and the chicken parm--both of which are fabulous.  I have also ordered their sald (Caesar) which is large enough to split among two people.  They give you large entrees and those too could easily be split.  It is easily one of the best Italian places I have been to in Las Vegas.  The only thing that is so-so is the bread...and really who cares much about that? I mean, bread should be good but it's not the deal breaker.  It just has too much herbs in it for my taste.

    "text": "Setting/ambiance: Located in the middle of the shopping forums near the big fountain, the gf wanted to eat here so that we can enjoy the setting. We thought it was beautiful here and we had a great time. I can see why people wouldn't wanna sit here though, it's a little difficult to carry on a good conversation because of the flow of people walking around in the shopping forums, plus the loud fountain, plus the customers trying to talk louder than the surrounding sounds.  Food: Polento Fries - The best thing they have. We got started with this as our appetizer and it was wonderful. Instead of potatoes on the inside, it's like a very soft, moist bread with a texture like a type of cheese or tofu of some sort. You dip these into their marinara sauce and yum, it's definitely a must try. Penne Pesto - My gf was craving pesto, so she ordered one with penne pasta which wasn't on the menu. This dish came out pretty bland and flavorless, she mixed in some of the marinara sauce from the polenta fries and said it was okay like that. Penne Puttanesca - I wanted something that would have a bit of a kick to it. This was a good choice; it had a very bold flavor with a bit if spiciness to it. I was very satisfied with it, I think my gf was jealous that she didn't order this entree! One problem I had with this dish was that they put way too much capers in it. At first it was okay, but by the end of the meal I found myself picking the capers out. Advice: tell them to take it easy on the capers when ordering the puttanesca! We also got their gelato for dessert. I ordered their cappuccino flavor. My gf got vanilla. Their vanilla gelato was delicious! My cappuccino... not so much - it wasn't horrible, but it pretty much had no flavor or distinct taste.  Service:  Pretty horrible. Especially for an Italian place, they were very inattentive and lacked personality. All servers looked rushed & not in sync with other workers. I almost had to yell across the patio to get my server's attention to get refills for our drinks. The server took a picture for us at the end which was cool I guess.",

We sat at the bar, and were greeted immediately by a very friendly bartender.  I had a glass of pinot noir, which was $12 as I recall and very good.  The wine list was solid, and they had several selections of white and red by the glass.  We decided to split the antipasto.  It was $13.95 and comes with the usual suspects.  I would want more meat, there was probably only 2 ounces, maybe 3 on the plate.  I think they can add more meat and charge an extra $3 for it and this dish would be a winner.  The marinated artichokes were great, as was the basil leaf included.  Peppers were solid as well, but none were very hot.  I know that most people don't like them hot, but maybe they could offer you hotter peppers if you want them.  Which, I always do.  You do get 4 large pieces of mozzarella.  All in all, it was excellent service, and I think a couple of tweaks to the dish would make it a 4 star appetizer.  There were a couple of dishes on the menu that looked really good, so I imagine we'll be back.",

Service: Prompt, attentive, and the waiter was very nice.  We had 9 people all showing up at different times and he was very accommodating.  We also had a B-Day and he added a B-day dish with a candle.  Food: Just OK.  No one disliked their dished but no-one totally loved them either.  I ordered the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (their \"signature dish\").  Basically it's lobster, crab, scallops, scallions and tomatoes in a white cream sauce.  It was ok at best.  Shrimp and Scallops wee flavorful, Lobster was not.  Sauce was bland.   Price:  Like most of the Strip it is over-priced.  Dishes are from $18 to $30.  Best way to describe this place...food is a tick less tasty than Olive Garden but cost $10 more per dish.",

My doctor tested me and told me I had food poisoning, my bowel tested positive for E-Coli. I had a Chicken Caesar Salad.  The food was cooked but apparently was still tainted which means that they do not take cleanliness in the kitchen seriously!  Although Las Vegas is a place for gambling, I suggest you not gamble with your health!  I'm also giving this place 4$ because with missing work, and doctor bills, this cost me a lot more than a couple hundred dollars for a nice steak house.",

My husband ordered the rigatoni bolognese.  Both were very good! The portions were good and the price wasn't bad.  The service SUCKS.  Our server was an older indian man who ignored us after we ordered just waters to drink (he obviously expected us to order alcohol and kept badgering us to order cocktails throughout the night).  He spent a lot of time talking and joking with his other tables and walked by our empty glasses several times.  We had to ask the bus boy for refiills.  I had to ask for everything twice and sometimes I still didn't get what I asked for (like a straw that I had to keep asking for).  At one point, I ordered an ice tea and never got it.  We had two empty water glasses, no tea, and we were so thirsty I had to get up and find a busser to get us water.  I should have given the tip to the poor guy that had to do our server's job for him because he was busy one table away laughing and joking and ignoring us. RUDE!  I always tip generously whether I order alcohol or ice water.  As a server, I myself understand how you hope to get a table that orders a lot of food and alcohol so your bill will be higher and the chances of getting a good tip goes up.  However, I am always nice to each and every one of my tables despite what they order.  I will tip more than usual if we receive good service even if my bill isn't high.   This place has good food, a good location, but should really work on hiring servers who will get their tables what they order and not have bad attitudes toward people who don't order lots of alcohol.",

Probably the longest time I've spent at the forum shoppes without shopping.  We ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana as part of our meal.  (We did family style here.)  It was soft, but not mushy - perfectly cooked IMO.  We also ordered the Deep Dish Pizza.  I loved how they used actual chunks of mozzarella instead of shredded.  It tasted really good.  I think the crust could have been more crispy and it got soggy really fast, but overall a good pick.  Our 3rd dish was the Pork risotto.  The pork was tender, but it was still a little chewy.  The risotto itself had tons of garlic, not a huge fan of the dish.  Our last dish was the shrimp ravioli, that day's special.   It came with a lemon-y type of cream sauce.  It was an okay dish.  I'm a fan of marinara over creamy sauces.  Since we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out a complimentary dessert.  It was huge!  I think it was the Banana Veneziana.  We were so full from dinner, but we couldn't stop eating the dessert because it was THAT good.  Great, trendy place to eat.  You might have to scream a little bit to carry a conversation because it was so loud sitting on their \"patio\", but great nonetheless.",

    "text": "We came to Trevi last night for a birthday dinner in a party of 13.  I will take the blame for dining with a party of 13 in Vegas for dinner (a bad idea in general, I'm learning).  The fountain at the restaurant is really nice and we sat right under it.  The restaurant was about half full.  Great ambiance for dinner.  We sat and ordered drinks.  30 minutes later, after asking about them, they arrived.  My wife's chardonnay had lipstick from the previous user on the glass, so I asked for a new glass and 20 minutes later, we had a new glass!  We ordered a caesar salad to split (we were in Caesar's Palace, so it has to be good, right?), my wife got the short rib and I got the salmon (both $28).  The salad came out quickly, but quite a bit of the lettuce had been frozen, so it was brownish and soggy.  The dressing wasn't bad and after seeing a show earlier we were near starving...so, we ate it.  The table bread wasn't anything to write home about, but decent.  About twenty-five minutes after ordering, the waiter came back to \"talk to the people who ordered salmon.\"  Uh oh.  The Italian restaurant was out of risotto (red flag), so he wanted to know what side we wanted instead.  I took his recommendation at Alfredo noodles.   The dishes took an hour to come out from ordering to serving.  About half of the dishes were warm/hot, the other half were cold.  Stone cold.  The salmon was dry and chewy.  So, right...don't go out with 13 people and you might get a warm dish.  The Alfredo was not quite as good as the boxed stuff you can get at the store.  Although the dish came with asparagus, they didn't give me asparagus with the Alfredo, so I asked for it.  Thirty minutes later, when I was done eating, the waiter told me it would be right out. I told him not to worry about it, but he brought it out and asked if anybody else at the table wanted the \"free asparagus\".  My wife's short rib looked good, but it was also cold.  In a normal circumstance, it makes sense to send back cold food that isn't up to a $28/plate standard.  But, by this time it was 10:30 and the hangover was starting to creep in with no food to counteract a day of \"activity\".  Note: the branzino was the best dish at the table by far.  I can imagine this place being a good experience for two people who knew what to order and had 2 hours to kill under the fountain.  To the waiter's credit, he was very sincere and wanted to do a good job.  He apologized several times, but it was clear he had too many tables and his kitchen staff sucks really, really bad.  He had his manager come over and it quickly became apparent why the restaurant was missing the mark.  She was defensive and told us that she had a horrible week trying to train a new staff with a new menu and that she was trying to manage the restaurant.  She offered us another round of drinks on the house, but at 10:50 PM with little food in us, it would have gotten ugly.  When I went to the restroom (passing the kitchen), the kitchen staff was clearly irritated that they were still working and I got a glare from a couple of them.  Sorry to burden you, guys!    So, why not 1 star?  Well, the waiter comped $300 off the bill.  That is a lot to comp and it was appreciated.  In my opinion, if Trevi doesn't get their stuff together, they are going to have a tough time making it before somebody who knows how to run a Vegas restaurant comes along.",

It is set inside Caesar's Palace in the atrium area that feels as though you are outside, with changing lighting to the sunset and the Trevi Fountain.  We requested to be seated near the fountain and were right next to it, and was nice to be accomodated.  The best part of the meal was my company and the atmosphere.  They have a wide selection of wine options and we chose the Valpolicella.  Entrees for our group included baked eggplant, ravioli, some type of salad with salami on it (she was going to go for the tuna but learned it's canned tuna) and all were just fair.    The service from our waiter was strange. Rufus, you were just weird.  His \"humor\" was insulting and really detracted from our experience.  He was condescending, didn't answer our questions directly, and told bad jokes.  It was frustrating to see that we as a young group of girls were being treated differently than the other patrons around us, although we were all paying customers. He came around near the end but I would think that for what is supposed to be a great restaurant, the staff would reflect that.  Unfortunately 18% gratuity is included for parties over 6 people.",

We had some Oreo chocolate gelato which wad awesome, and probably the best/highest quality gelato that I have ever had.  The service was great. Our waiter regularly stopped by to give refills and to check that we were satisfied.  All in all, I would come here again, but I will definitely try something else!",

Had the pizzette as an app.  I had the cheese pizza and my girlfriend had the shrimp caesar salad with shrimp.  Pizzette was very tasty.  Pizza had pizza sauce instead of marinara sauce that so many Italian restaurants use.  Pizza was very good, not great but considering it is 2000 miles from NY, it was good,  Shrimp Caesar salad was solid and huge.  We also had desert of creme broulee and tiramisu, both were excellent.  Had Jennifer as our server and she did an excellent job.  Overall very good place.  Will definitely visit again.",

Another at our table has allergies & ordered a bowl of pasta with butter, child's size... He was, very accommodating.  Great wine list & energetic atmosphere.  We were dining late.. Around 10pm on a weeknight, so I'm sure the place gets crazier on the weekends... But all in all a great time & Rufus made our dining experience over the top just by being himself.",

I've come to Trevi several times and don't know how I missed writing a review. No matter what you get, it will be authentic and delicious.  We stopped in for lunch so didn't want to get anything too heavy. We got the calamari as an appetizer which was amazing!!! And shares a chicken pizza. What I love about their pizza is that it's more like a flatbread. Super thin crust, that perfect crunch.  When looking at the menu, I was aiming towards the caprese salad but was told it's a very large portion. The waitress then came up to be and told me the chef was able to make me a small size if I preferred. So glad they did, it was amazing.  It's great to see a restaurant be so accommodating outside of their menu.  As far as service, we were seated right away without having reservations. Our waitress was very sweet and brought us refills on our drinks without us having to ask for it. Can't wait to come back again!",

For our entrees we got the chilean sea bass and rib-eye.  I thought the sea bass was pretty tough and overcooked.  I also think the rib eye was a bit on the salty side.  Maybe we should have tried the pizza or the pasta - they looked pretty good for other people who got it. Nothing was bad, but definitely nothing I would come back for either.

We then went to our table and started with the bread and the dipping oil which was good, make sure to ask for a side of balsamic vinegar to add to it so yummy. I had the side caeser and fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, prosciutto, and peas - it was very good and very filling.

And so glad we did.  Very friendly from the moment we walked in. Let us feel the vibe of the place and pick our own seating choice. We sat outside next to the fountain which was great as we were in the people watching mood.   They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating is more cozy and family style. The outdoor seating is airy and energetic.  As for the food, we ordered the Fettuccine Pollo Carbonara which was sinfully delicious. Very rich with intense flavors yet not overly creamy. But Heavy enough for two to share.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to dine on the strip.  Quality food with quality service.",

The dish is the perfect size for two and extremely good! For dinner I had the chicken parm. Portion sizes are really big! Had I know I wouldn't have ordered the appetizers, but everything was so good!!  Be sure to try the frozen Peach Bellini!

The restaurant is nice, and has nice patio seating, as well. The service was nice and friendly, so no complaints there. The only reason I give this place a 3, instead of a 4 is the food. I can honestly say that I just didn't like my food, very much. I had the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and cooked well, but the sauce was sour. It tasted like they used much lemon juice, or something. I'm not typically one to send food back, unless it's really bad. it wasn't so bad that I couldn't eat it, but it was bad enough so I have no need to eat here again. Perhaps if someone else is paying...haha. With so many better options on the strip, I don't feel the need to come here again.",

    "text": "Owned by the Landry's Restaurant Group at the center of Caesars' Forum Shops it is no secret that TREVI Italian Restaurant is targeted at tourists, so with a trio in town from Paris looking for something 'casual' it was as a group of five that dinner was served, Chef Jose M. Navarro and his team showing exactly why Las Vegas remains far ahead of the pack in terms of high volume Restaurants as relates to both Cuisine and service.  Located amidst giants such as Armani, Gucci and Ferragamo plus the \"Fountain of the Gods,\" a pseudo-outdoor patio popular for people watching cozying right up to flowing waters, it is from a podium that guests are led to tables spread across two floors, a rounded booth overlooking both kitchen and dining room providing plenty of space and comfort as a Wedding Party one table over celebrated one of Las Vegas' many newlywed couples.  Accessible yet offering enough intrigue and good ingredients to please the culinary-minded, simple plates and 'signatures' joined by seasonal inspirations, happy hour specials and at least one off-menu Pasta daily, it was with a round of Drinks plus warm Bread that dinner got underway, the famous Trevi Peach Bellini a rightful favorite that is deceptively boozy while a seasonal Blueberry Martini was also quite pleasant thanks to an herbaceous linger.  Managing volume like professionals, both the decibel level and meal's pacing just right considering at least two-hundred guests around 7pm on a Saturday, it was as drinks were being sipped that Appetizers were served with ample descriptions, the simple Caprese Salad showing off sourcing while Prosciutto with Melons in various forms plus Summer's Steak Tartare did the same while also upping the ante by way of their multi-textured presentations.  Told that TREVI's Brick Oven Pizzas are somewhat hit and miss, though any opportunity to indulge in the World's second most popular dish is generally worthwhile, it was prior to Pasta that a deep-dish \"Lasagna\" Pie was served bubbling hot with layers of Meat and Cheese atop crisp and buttery Crust, a single slice probably enough for most given the heft but one of the rare 'hybrid' Foods that actually pulls double-duty in representing both classics equally.  Making several Pastas in-house, no small feat for such a venue, it was a bit disheartening that otherwise good Shellfish got a little lost amidst thick Cream Sauce but turning attention to three filled Noodles things were immediately back on track, an \"appetizer\" of Pea Casoncelli finding favor even from someone who generally does not like Mushrooms thanks to its freshness while both the daily-special Agnolotti and Chicken Ravioli were plump and nicely cooked with the former expectedly rich but nicely balanced by the sweet Wine Reduction.    Onward to Entrees, several at the table already getting full, it was in place of menu-suggested Salmon that Scallops were set amidst fragrant Dill Cream and Asparagus, the roasted Tomatoes just one of many excellent accoutrements that also included creamy Corn alongside medium-rare Steak and Kale that was almost as crisp and delicious as the juicy Chicken it was plated with.  Accepting an offer of Coffee prior to Dessert, the educated and affable server correctly naming and preparing  an \"Iced Americano\" it was after a bit of Hockey talk that three sizable housemade sweets arrived, the Tiramisu fairly typical while TREVI's molten \"Chocolate Gooey Cake\" and Italian Cream wedge both outpaced many Las Vegas fine-dining institutions in terms of taste and texture, not to mention portion, with blend of Coconut, Pecans and Cream Cheese Frosting arguably one of the most underrated Desserts offered anywhere in Sin City.  FOUR STARS:  Just under $360 all-in, a complimentary round of Housemade Lemoncello offered to finish, it is safe to say that TREVI over-performed expectations and although a \"tourist\" Restaurant in the middle of a Shopping Mall may not be some people's idea of a good night out the majority, including those who travel to eat, can certainly find a lot to enjoy about the experience, particularly when eating with people who aren't necessarily into 'fine dining' but still want a delicious meal with great service.",

To be honest, the house salad wasn't that great (get the Caesar salad instead - trust me). The bolgonese was a very nice portion and also came with mozzarella on top! Now onto dessert, you have a couple of choices but we got the gelato. You get 2 scoop of any gelato flavor of your choice!   I really just love the whole vibe and aesthetic of the restaurant. It's right by the Trevi fountain and tucked in between Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Tiffany & Co. Like wowww, what a view!   Our server was also very attentive and sweet! He was extremely helpful and charismatic. He made great conversation with us and was quick to get whatever we needed.   All in all, an amazing place to grab dinner!!",

This restaurant is part of the Fountain of the Gods. This restaurant is just beautiful. We had a group of 9 people and only had a 5 minute wait. They were very accommodating for a group of 9 without a reservation.  We ordered calamari and fried zucchini as table appetizers. We all ordered drinks with our meals. One speciality drink took about 15 minutes however. I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet Sauvignon and the Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare. It was SO good and right up my alley with the different seafood in the dish.   Our server asked if we were there for a special occasion and we told him that it was for our friends Bachelorette. He then brought out a big piece of tiramisu for the table to share. Our server was very attentive and just all around great!

I did call the restaurant and I am only assuming the same girl answered since she wouldn't connect me to a Manager without insisting on knowing why.

    "text": "One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas.   Made reservations and were seated immediately at our choice of tables, which happened to be on the patio overlooking the Forum Shops.  Amazing to sit there, watch the people walk by, have a great meal and enjoy the scenery.  Regina was our waitress and she was fantastic. She knew the menu and was always there for us.  I began with the minestrone.  Who doesn't have minestrone at an Italian restaurant?  So good; very flavorful, lots of vegetables and not too salty. My main dish was the Eggplant Parm. Aside from the pound of cheese on top, it was very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but still very good.  My friends bragged about their Fettuccine Pollo Carbonara and lasagna, as well as the Calamari Fritti appetizer.  All in all, a great meal, great atmosphere and great service.  What more can you ask for?",

The server was super nice. She had a smile the entire time. We didn't have any drinks because we partied wayyy too hard the night before. Moving on to the food - the calamari was really good, a must try. The chicken carbonara was okay and to be honest, I make it better at home. My friend ordered the penne diavolo, and after trying a bite I was totally hooked. It's a little on the spicy side and it's pretty amazing. I'll go try their other dishes next time I visit.",

    "text": "Not bad! The food was good, and atmosphere was nice, but our server was a little weird O_O. We went for dinner after watching Mystere :)  Place: It's literally smack dab in the center of the Caesars Forum Shops next to the giant status. It's a little noisy to sit \"outside\", but I personally thought that it was very beautiful and had great atmosphere. It's really beautiful there, and they have a gelatto cart right there by the patio seating area. (That was the main attraction that drew me to the restaurant, but sadly, I failed to save room for dessert and ended up not getting the gelatto :()  Service: Our server (I forget his name) really didn't know how to do his job. His jokes were offensive, and he just kept yelling at us. I'm sure he didn't mean to, but his tone of voice was very overwhelming. When he couldn't understand our order, we clarified the order very kindly, but he ended up blabbing on and on justifying why he couldn't hear properly the first time. We also heard him offend another costumer at another table by making fun of the customer's name. It was kind of funny though, because my friend and I started playing \"merit/demerits\" and pointed out when the server deserved merits and when he deserved demerits. By the end of the night, he had wayyy more demerits than merits.  Food: I got the Limone Fettuccine, which was a chicken fettucine in a tart lemon cream sauce. It was really really good, and the tartness of the cream sauce made it feel less heavy. I still couldn't finish the food though, because the portions were quite large! The price was, i suppose, reasonable for its location and cuisine type. I'm a cheapass so it was still expensive to me :S.  Other: No wait (well it was after 9PM) and the food came out really fast.",

My boyfriend and I did not have to wait, luckily, but were sat right next to the greek gods water fountain which turned out to be very loud/distracting.  Service was slow because it was a busy.  The food (Italian themed) was nothing special.  I ordered the linguine ai frutti di mare, one of their specialties, which was delicious but expensive for the small portion and lacked enough seafood.  My boyfriend's sausage pizza had onions that were way overcooked.  Overall, I will not be returning and am surprised at the poor value of their food for the great location.",

The service is about average.   Went again a few days ago to give them another chance. My server kept calling me \"boss\" and \"son\" which seemed a bit weird since I'm a customer and older than him. I ordered the risotto with white fish. It was good although the rice wasn't quite tender enough and had a bit of a crunch to it. The fish was cooked perfectly though and the sauce was good!

Next time we go back, we're going to be sure to stop by for their business lunch. 20 bucks for a soup or salad, and an entree? Can't beat that in Vegas.

I have a weakness for tiramisu and gelato, and their tiramisu gelato did not disappoint!  Excellent rum and espresso flavor with a swirl of cocoa powder.

The rest was just Italian food that someone I know could probably make just as well for me. Nick and I split a chopped Italian salad and Rigatoni Bolognese. I would have rather had Burger Palace.  The service however was outstanding. And that always goes a long way in my book.",

There's the really expensive place by H&M and then there is Trevi which is located by the fountain in front of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Cartier..... I think you catch my drift.   FLAVORS: They offer a wide array of flavors. You can sample each and every one of them if your heart desires. There are only 20 or so flavors served here: vanilla, chocolate, cappuccino, pistachio, and more. The other place has a bigger selection but at double the cost.  $: Small (1 scoop) will cost you a few dollars. Large (2 scoops) around $6-ish.   SERVICE: The girl who was working was really nice and patient. She had a feeling I worked at the Forum Shops (and I do) and she extended the appropriate discount to me. I forgot what it was but I think it was close to 50%.   I don't really eat gelato. But when I do, I eat the gelato at Trevi!",

We were never left unattended and enjoyed the laughter of the nearby tables. I got the gnocchi with tomato cream sauce and prawns at Jener's suggestion. Not on the menu.  My partner got the Pre Fix with the Bolognese.  Dont miss the Trevi salad.  It is light, tangy and crisp.

    "text": "I was to Trevi in January for a Yelp Elite event and I was sure I'd come back and try the menu.  I just didn't think I'd take this long.  Before our show at the Colosseum last night, we came here.  We were asked if we wanted to eat on the patio or inside.  Because the water flow at the fountain is loud, we asked for a patio seat near the back.  That's exactly what we got from the delightful hostess.  Within moments, our server was there to take our drink order and a runner stopped with fresh bread and a bottle of olive oil with a sprig of rosemary.  She poured some of the oil into a small dish for dipping the bread.  Our iced teas were quickly brought.  We had a few questions and our server, Cheyanne, was an excellent help.  My wife ordered the chicken Limone which the menu describes as \"fettuccine with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon zest tossed in a tangy cream sauce.\"  I got the pollo la Griglia which is described as \"grilled chicken medallions with oven-roasted tomatoes, artichoke hearts and provolone cheese in a tomato caper bianco sauce, served with risotto cake and asparagus.\"  For dessert, we shared a Coppa Cioccolata which is described as \"chocolate gelato and fresh raspberries with chocolate & raspberry sauces.\"  The food was excellent.  The cream sauce with my wife's chicken was very good, and she loved the touch of the sun-dried tomatoes in the sauce.  The chicken was moist and tender.  My chicken was also very good.  The provolone was quite stringy and made the dish very tasty!  The risotto cakes were something new for me and I'm so glad I got them.  I think I'll return and just get some risotto cakes they were that good.  Dessert was also excellent!  The gelato was dark chocolate and had a very rich flavor.  The fresh raspberries and the sauces just added to a good dessert and a perfect size for sharing.  The ambiance was outstanding!  Watching the ceiling lights change brightness and color to emulate sunrises and sunsets and seeing the small blue lights for stars while listening to the water at the fountain makes for a romantic and scenic setting.  It's so much fun to dine at a place like this in Las Vegas where we can watch the tourists as they stroll by and take photos of everything.  What a city!  As for service, it was first rate!  Our table was never unattended by someone.  When I put and empty packet of Sweet 'n Low on the table, it was removed almost immediately.  Cheyanne or one of the bussers kept our iced teas refilled.  She was a very pleasant young woman.  She boxed some leftovers and included a packet with plastic ware and a napkin.    I had promised Brandon, the general manager, at our Yelp event that I'd be back.  When I asked about him last night, Cheyanne gave him my message and he came to the table and chatted with us.  I also watched as he went to other tables to check on diners.  He's alert to what's going on and he's a very personable guy.  The staff and the food make this place a will return.  I am a big fan!!",

    "text": "Certainly a unique experience. Great people watching and surprisingly good food for inside a casino. The replica fountain of Trevi is really beautiful and the way the \"sky\" subtly changes colors and light is relaxing and fun.   Do you feel like you are in the heart of Rome at an elegant restaurant? No. But it is still a pretty cool place to enjoy a meal.   I'm Italian and I live in Philadelphia which is known for great Italian cuisine so my bar is set pretty high, but the food was decent and the service was excellent. I'd give 3.5 for food but really nice service pushed it to a 4 star.   Caprese appetizer was excellent. Tomato was ripe and the mozzarella was light and fresh. Bread is disappointing, tasted like grocery store loaf with no hearty crust. My coworker had seafood and angel hair which he liked. I had eggplant parm which was far too heavy on the cheese but cut thin and crispy which I liked. Cappuccino was nice with a small biscotti on the side. Wine list was extensive.   I was here for a work conference so my coworker and I spent about two hours lingering over the meal and talking and we never once felt rushed.   Lovely relaxing experience.",

We requested to move and they easily accommodated us. We moved Into the bar area where happy hour was going on and ended up having a great sever (Antonio i believe was his name) and he took great care of us! Even let us have happy hour prices past that end time!!! The food was fantastic! The drinks were great...a little on the pricey side but it's Vegas so we expected it. I definitely want to visit here again when in Vegas.",

    "text": "So, as amazing as I thought the ambience and food were, the service truly missed the mark.. Trevi offers dining inside and outside the restaurant.  I was in a group of 12 people last night, and it was one misstep after another.. We arrived early but were seated at our appropriate time..the server seemed to be on his game, until after we got our menus.  The process of ordering your drinks, then appetizers, and the main course took over 30 minutes..   So after we placed our order, I noticed that other parties that arrived more than 40 minutes after us, were already eating their main course.. We didn't receive our meal until over an hour of being there... The funniest thing! Although the tables outside were relatively full.. the inside tables were were sparse.. I believe I counted 6 tables were occupied.   Oh, and my colleague ordered a customized drink.. And after he dropped everyone's drink, and left to attend to other tables.. My colleague was getting up to go to the bar 15 min later to ask if they were going to customize the drink.. And he said.. Oh yah, let me see if they can do that.. Unacceptable.  My water glass was empty for what seemed forever. He finally noticed 15 minutes after it was empty, but it didn't get filled for 20 minutes after that.   Again, love the food, but if you're hungry.. And you're ever running on a schedule, this wouldn't be my choice place to go..   Our bill came out to an average of $74 per person when we divided it out.. Included the meal tax and gratuity.  We had wine and cocktails.. Appetizers and our meals - no dessert because we thought it would only add on to our time there..   I'd give 4 stars for the food, but a 1 for service",

It was around 9pm and we were immediately seated outside next to the water fountain with Pegasai. The menu had reasonably prices and we took about 20 min to choose what to order. We picked the calamari as appetizers and they also offered complimentary garlic bread. We decided to share our dishes such as steak salad, clam pasta, and chicken entree. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli appetizer and it was delicious! For dessert, we ordered the gooey chocolate fudge cake for 12 bucks but it was worth it! For a party of 9 people, we could not finish it. Overall, it was a great dining experience since our waiter gave us extra bread. I would definitely recommend those who couldn't afford to go to the buffet to come here instead for dinner.",

    "text": "Mediocre at best though I suppose you come here for the \"ambiance\" anyway.  We came here for \"Trevi Time\" but found out that you have to actually sit at the bar counter to get the HH prices.  We opted to then pass on HH since we wanted to sit out by the fountain.  The fountain is loud as others have said but it actually is cool having it as part of your view as well as being able to see the \"sky\" above change from day to night.    Food and drinks were just \"meh.\"  I had the frozen bellini and my sister had either the same drink or the Capri Coral Crush.  One thing's for sure about both of our drinks: the drinks themselves while not being strong sure had a strong alcohol taste which we both found unpleasant.  Thank goodness I had ordered gelato with mine or else I would not have been able to drink much of the bellini at all!    To eat we ordered the lasagna pizza since it sounded interesting and seemed to get good reviews.  I personally wasn't too crazy about it.  I was expecting more of a deep dish pizza taste to it and I've had really good deep dish pizza so I was disappointed to find out it was more lasagna than pizza, and cold lasagna at that.  And I can actually say that I find Sbarro lasagna tastier than Trevi's lasagna pizza!    It's definitely fun and kitschy to sit outside by the fountain - just don't expect to be blown away by the food or drinks.",

Service: Our server was really friendly and food came out quickly.  Food: Here is where Trevi fails...  -- The salmon on the salmon salad was rubbery and dry. This was unfortunate because the rest of the salad was nice and fresh. For $24+ I don't recommend this dish at all.  -- Mini-me had the spaghetti with meatballs and demolished it. This could be because I made her walk up an appetite (3 hours worth of walking) but I'm going to go with the notion that she just really liked her spaghetti.  -- Complimentary bread was just okay.  Overall: Trevi is really overpriced for what it is. With so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas I can't imagine we'd ever return.",

Their food is not that good, and I had way better drinks for free at the casino. $12 for a drink that tastes like crap (excuse my language). We tried their signature Bellini and strawberry lime or something like this. They just cut 1 strawberry and threw it into a cheap mix you buy $3.99 for a bottle. Belllini was ok if it cost $6 at the beach bar. They did not even try to create something decent. I paid $15 at Il Mulino for a drink and it was heavenly. 3 dollars less and what a difference. No, I absolutely do not try to compare this eatery to Il Mulino, but when you charge $12 I expect something better. My brucheta was soggy, eggplant cooked in some greasy oil. Do not even start me on the quality of their coffee.  I do not really understand how it is possible to give 5 stars to this restaurant unless all other 4 stars go towards the view of the fountains.  They also were not very accommodating when my relatives asked to split one of their soups. They took the order, but brought one bowl with a soup. The waitress told that they did not split it because it would ruin a presentation. What presentation? There was mess of a soup in that bowl without anything added. She brought an extra plate so we split it ourselves.  On the positive side our pepperoni pizza was pretty good. Veal masala was ok, but linguini were overcooked. What a shame for any Italian restaurant.",

I had to have an Old Fashioned with Makers Mark....it was very good to a point of being strong. Everybody loved their drinks.  We got some appts and the real stand out was the calimari.  It was so flavorful and tender. It was mostly the rings with some small while squids. It was really fresh and could have munched on it all night.  They also have a gelato bar, it looked really good. So if your sweet tooth is acting up they have great desserts.",

We mentioned how hungry we were and he had the kitchen expedite our food so we could eat sooner. He also brought us our ice cream after our meal which was very nice. The food was great, service was great. We almost came back the second night! Will definitely visit again. Thanks Rufus",

I gave this place a 3 star because the food was not as great as I remembered it being.  The chicken was slightly on the dry side for the pasta.  I should have known because it wasn't a fan favorite dish on their menu.  The pizza was tasty though.  The service here however, is kind of bad.  Since we were placed next to larger parties, our table was usually ignored.  Usually they would be on top of the quick refills of water, but we would have to wait almost 7 - 10 mins just to get a waiter's attention.  P.S. Come with a large group, otherwise they won't focus on you that much.",

So I started off with a salad, the fettuccini pollo carbonara as my main dish and some ice cream. The salad wasn't bad the veggies were crisp and fresh, the dressing was decent no real complaints there. Now here is the downgrade part, the carbonara dish wasn't True carbonara it was merely a fettuccini chicken alfredo type dish IMO. The dish lacked any real black pepper for taste, lack of egg yolk and lot of cheese to make it True carbonara. If your going to make a carbonara dish then make it True to fashion or don't call it carbonara that a lone gives them the 2 star rating. Service was good and they have plenty of places to sit down and a bar just the food turned me away I wouldn't come back. Plenty of other chain Italian restaurants that could beat this place out right now in quality and taste. 2 out of 5 stars is all it gets.",

This year was no different so we showed up for dinner and were seated in a great spot by the fountain.  We feel the wine menu prices have changed drastically.   We bought a cheaper bottle and it was still $60.   I had a Caesar salad which was good and my husband had the caprese, which is always a winner.   We both had the penne bolognese which was very good.     Service was good and we had a nice evening.    In the end, with a tip, our bill was $150.   For us, that's not a typical evening out.   I think our run at this restaurant is over as it's become unaffordable.   Breaks my heart as I love it here.   Sure, I could forgo the wine and make it more affordable, but I like having a bottle with dinner and enjoying the dining experience.   We can find that elsewhere in Vegas and still be happy.",

Ok, so I won a bit of money of the NFL Playoffs last time I was in Vegas, and I had just left a cigar lounge where I had a delicious Cohiba and a glass of some of the finest 32 year single malt Scotch man can get his hands on.    and sure, I was pretty heavily intoxicated and food was all amazing and almost alien to me at times, but I still do know my food.  Got the calamari fritto and the mozzerella sticks to snack on first.  Breading on both is done to perfection and they started the meal off with a thumbs up.    Got Trevi's signature dish, their Frutti Di Mare.  This is a seafood pasta, comprised of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions.  EPIC.  Pasta sauce was perfect, fish was fresh and BY NO MEANS skipped on, and the flavor combinations went incredibly.   Got sum dessert the table split, can't honestly tell you what it was but I was on point as well.  Oh, and those cookies they have are dank as fuck too.    Anywho,  This place has my respect.  When your a big dog and you know it, sometimes you just know you gotta run along with the other big dogs...just becuz you can.

We were there for all of 25 minutes and she did not check on us once. I had to get her attention twice. I understand that servers and bartenders generally do not like dealing with happy hour clientele, but put in a little effort. She was either just starting or ending her shift, as she was much more concerned with sidework than the customers. Luckily, there was another bartender (or assistant?) who was much more attentive. We only ordered two plates: the stuffed mushrooms and the bruschetta. Both were a bit underwhelming. I had the Chianti, which was pleasant. The atmosphere is nice enough.",

This place is in the middle of the Forum Shops by the Trevi fountain. I was skeptical about a restaurant located in the mall, but loved it. The restaurant makes you feel like you're outside since there's a \"patio\" area (where we sat) but you're covered and inside the mall.   Service was fairly quick and polite. We had a beer and a glass of wine to start and I really liked my pinot grigio.   For entrees, I had the beef with sauteed string beans and my husband had fettucine alfredo with shrimp. My steak was phenomenal. I have never seen a steak so thick in my entire life. It was cute and round and looked like it was the size of a fist. SO tender and juicy, just like a steak should be.  My husband seemed to like his joice, too. I know that we were enjoying our food when neither one of us came up for air and we didn't talk until we're done. Which may or may not have happened.   With tip, our dinner came out to around $100 but in my opinion was worth it.",

A $10.00 salad that came between us and the restaurant. It became a matter of principle and VERY poor customer service. The appetizers of calamari and crab/pasta balls were hot, filling and delicious. My husband's next course of Caesar salad (he had the restaurant week 3 course special) was ok but I thought rather small. I ordered the Trevi salad. A rather large salad with chopped tomatoes, mozzarella, hearts of palm, tomatoes and a vinaigrette dressing($10).  One bite of this salad and I knew something wasn't right with the dressing. I mixed the salad around with my fork, one more bite and I realized the dressing tasted like some type of white vinegar diluted with water. NO seasoning, ZERO taste. As the server came by I handed him the salad and told him very nicely that I found it inedible due to the dressing. He explained that they recently switched to a different kind of vinegar. I said \"that's fine, but that's all that's on it and it tastes diluted. I just can't eat it\" He took the full salad away minus a couple of bites and apologized but thanked me for being \"nice\" about it. The meal continued on and was truly very good. I had a generous, and piping hot portion of chicken parmigiana while my husband enjoyed the papardalle bolognese. We told the waiter how much we were enjoying the food of course with the exception of my salad. After adding two cocktails and a glass of wine and coffee the $140 check arrived. The problem was the $10 charge for the salad was still on it. I just assumed that a good server and a good manager on duty would have removed the charge automatically. I was wrong. This is where what could have ended as a great experience despite the salad, started to go quickly downhill. I asked the server to kindly remove the salad charge. He looked rather bewildered and stuttered a bit and said \"oh yeah sure of course, of course\". After several minutes the manager on duty appeared and without asking me anything stated that if I didn't want to pay for the salad, I shouldn't have eaten it. I told her I had to eat a couple of bites to realize how bad it was but in actuality I returned most of the salad uneaten. She then felt it necessary to tell me the server said I ate the entire salad!!!! I said \"NO!!! Send him here and let him tell me that. We are not complaining about anything else.  Just a lousy salad!!\" She then said I should have taken him up on his offer to bring me another type of salad. I told her he didn't make that offer. Very reluctantly she said \"ok we will remove the charge\" but it was obvious that she wasn't happy about it and was given a different story by the server. When the server finally returned he spun his own tale. I asked him why he told his manager that I ate the salad. He said \"this is how I remember it, you ate the salad and I asked how it was all you said you said 'eh'. That's how I remember it.\" Now I could feel my blood pressure rising. I reminded him that that was not the case AT ALL. We paid the check that they reluctantly reduced by $10 and we left with a \"bad taste in our mouths\" not from the salad or the rest of the meal but from the attitude of the server and the manager over what was a very small portion of our meal and the overall bill. Consequently I have tried on three different occasions to call to speak to \"John\" the general manager. I don't know if he was there or not but on all three occasions employees tried very hard to direct me to someone else. My distinct feeling is they are all afraid of complaints going to him and/or upper management. There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas I recommend skipping this one for one with a more customer friendly staff. Who enjoys this kind of aggravation when you're on vacation, not me.",

The servers were very attentive (even if a few of them looked lost in the background a few times) making sure he thoroughly explained each of the dishes and was happy to give his honest opinion about them.   We split the fried raviolis, which were delicious especially with the MOUND of parmesan we were given.  I ordered the special which was some sort of lamb with grilled pears, risotto and asparagus which I substituted for green beans.  Surprisingly, the lamb was the biggest let down on the plate as everything else was hands-down amazing.  It wasn't bad... just not great.  My friend's dishes were apparently fantastic, and everything tat passed by us looked phenomenal.  I would definitely go back.",

I was seated immediately in the \"outside\" area (it's all technically indoors because you're inside the forum shops, it's just louder if you sit on the patio than inside the restaurant).   My server was friendly and suggested I get the Capri Coral Crush...which I would suggest to you! It was AMAZING! Sounds much more melony than it is, it actually has a really great Mango taste served garnished with a mint sprig. Yum.   They brought out warm bread and a little plate of olive oil which was nice since I was starving (see CARB! craving above). The bread was okay, it probably would not have been had it been cold, but warm it was fine and not too dry.   I ordered the linguine with clams - white sauce.  Always a favorite of mine and it did not disappoint.  LOTS of clams.  It was not my favorite ever, but it was really good and was served fairly quickly considering what a crowd they had in the restaurant.  I would absolutely go back here, particularly for their happy hour Sunday-Friday with half off cocktails! I need another one of those Capri Coral Crush's!",

I wanted to advise you of some good and not so good observations that I feel I should bring to your attention.  Our waiter Joey was excellent. He was prompt and catered to my party of 8 with great care and hospitality.   Contrarily, I observed one of the kitchen staff place an order of chicken Ceaser salad  on the table in a not so flattering way. Best description is that it was just tossed on the table without a care. Sorry, I had no name to provide only that he and another colleague were amused at the action.  Also I and another in my party ordered one of the specials. Swordfish. It was cold and Joey immediately retuned it to the kitchen for a quick microwave. Still I was disappointed that it arrived in that state.  Otherwise all the food orders were enjoyed by all.",

Alas, the Chicken Francese I had here was the best ever! It was so fresh, and so tasty I took my time on it. It was probably the first time my wife ever finished her food before I did. So frikkin' good.  It's also worth noting our entrees made it to the table like lightning. I was floored. I had only eaten one piece of bread prior. I'm always suspicious when that happens, but like I said, this food was very good. And finally, we had the triple Gelato for dessert. I'm a Gelato snob as much as I'm an Italian food snob, which figures since they pretty much go hand-in-hand. In fact, it was the Gelato counter that made our decision. If we can have a nice dinner next to that beautiful fountain under the fake sky with Gelato for the win, I call that a good day.   I also really appreciated the manager-type who came over to the table to check up on things. What a fun dude and great conversationalist. Seeing that helps explain why we had exceptional service and food. Hey - don't ever take it for granted. Some Vegas places are just happy to take your money and boot your pants.",

I guess I'll give them this: if this were genuinely  a restaurant overlooking the trevi fountain in Rome, it would be similarly overpriced, crowded and noisy. So they've got a good replica going on at least.  The food was good as I said, but nothing to write home about. Fettuccini Alfredo was much better than say, Olive Garden, but it's probably not going to have you come crawling back for more.  Wife got a $10 drink which came out of an auto smoothie machine... Could have just done fat Tuesdays for that.  Anyway, A.OK, but pass if you are  really looking for fine dining and not just a fun and unique atmosphere.",

I had the Saltimbocca salad, my mom had the Salmon Agnolotti and we split, the agnolotti was so good, thin layer of pasta, cooked perfectly al dente. My sister had the Linguine de la mare, but she had it with their bianci sauce instead in the white sauce, they were super accommodating. A dining partner had capellini with spicy red sauce, she is a vegetarian and like I said they were super accommodating. Cute atmosphere, and our server Rufus was so funny and engaging. I will definitely come back.",

I walked by and decided to try it out as I had seen it on my prior trips to Vegas. I scanned the menu and asked the chef for his recommendation. He suggested the pappardelle bolognese with meatballs, which I chose. I am always a sucker for a good hearty bolognese and liked the addition of the meatballs. I also ordered a pomegranate cosmo since I appreciate a good cosmo, very SATC I know. Before your meal, they give you a complimentary bread basket with olive oil. The bread was delicious, fresh, and soft without being doughy. The pasta came out and I was instantly surprised at the portion which was huge. However, if you're a foodie like me; that's not an issue. The meatballs were succulent and juicy, the pasta al dente, and the bolognese sauce was zesty, hearty, and very flavorful. It was absolutely delicious. I was very full by the end of my meal and very satisfied. The pomegranate cosmo was also very balanced while not being overly fruity and sweet. The service was also very attentive  and my water glass was constantly full. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will be back on my next trip.",

Good meal, great deal! (BTW, the show was Absinthe, and it was fantastic!)  The meal was prepaid (tip included), so I wouldn't have been surprised to get subpar service. But that was far from the case. Our server, David, was friendly and attentive, and the meal was also better than I expected. We each had the Trevi salad, which had mixed greens, mozzarella, and a bevy of chopped vegetables, including hearts of palm. A great start to the meal! We had three options for our entrees, and we selected the chicken fettucine and the pappardelle bolognese to share. On paper, the fettucine sounded better (there were peas and proscuitto along with chicken), and it was good enough. But the pappardelle was great! Really tasty meat sauce and perfectly prepared pasta. For dessert, we split the sorbet (raspberry and lemon) and gelato (chocolate and vanilla). These were BIG portions! And while the sorbets were fine, we both really enjoyed the gelati (I preferred the chocolate, and my husband loved the vanilla).   We \"upgraded\" the meal by buying a bottle of wine (an Oregon pinot gris), and I had a shot of limoncello after dinner to celebrate my birthday. Prices for both were really reasonable ($35 for the wine and $8 for the shot), especially considering that the menu prices for our entrees were $24 a plate. Good thing we got that deal through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a>!   Trevi is located next to a big fountain, so it's a little loud when you're sitting outside (like we were). But it's a great place to people watch, and if you don't mind paying Strip prices for pasta, it's a fine place to eat--especially as part of a package deal with Absinthe! (Seriously, check it out. One of the best shows in town!)",

At one point, we considered walking out because no one came by our table for about 15 mins after we had gotten seated. And bless her heart...the waitress who did show up wasn't even a waitress but a bartender and had no idea what was up or down.  Menu is boring. Very typical Olive Garden-esque \"Italian\" food. We stopped in because we were hungry and overwhelmed by the sheer number of restaurants and eateries.  I won't be stopping back here. Food wasn't good enough to forgive the service.",

Food- Ordered Rigatoni Bolognese and the Lasagna Pizza to share with my husband. The pasta was just ok, but it was cold. The meat sauce was hot, but the pasta was cold for some reason? This has never happened to me before unless it was actually a cold pasta dish...but shouldn't the pasta be hot or at least warm?? The Lasagna Pizza was pretty good, no complaints there, but all in all the food didn't make me want to come back.   Service-Weak. All the other times I've been here the servers have been very attentive, and available in case we needed something. Our server was never around! We had to wait just to get some Parmesan cheese on our food, and I clearly remember servers doing this almost immediately after you've been served your meal. We finished our drinks, but our server was not around to ask if we wanted refills? The last straw was when we tried to pay the bill, he was no where to be found so we decided to use some good ol' cash instead of our credit card and save us another half hour of this terrible service.  Like I said, this used to be my go-to Italian restaurant on the strip...time to move on.",

    "text": "It's so hard to review restaurants in Vegas. It seems that they don't operate the same as any other place in the US. I generally expect high prices, mediocre service, a bad location or environment. However, I thought Trevi was a nice surprise.  Trevi is located in the middle of the Forum Shops attached to Caesar's Palace. It's a mostly \"outside\" restaurant on the piazza near a replica of the Trevi fountain.  My friend and I put our names in. It only took about 15 minutes on a Friday night. The host sat us at a two top near a pillar. It was so awkward and we were right where the servers were setting up all their trays of food. It was awful. We were moved to another table which was much better.  Our server was good though he disappeared for a long time at once point. Towards the end of the meal the service was great so he must have been busy.  My friend, Jeffrey B., ordered the minestrone. I tried it and it was excellent. He also got the eggplant parmasean. He said it was good but the portion was oddly small. I order the lasagna pizza. It was a huge deep dish pizza with layers of cheese and sausage and sauce. It was delicious and I didn't even eat half. The bread and oil was also very good. For dessert we got the Spaghetti Ice which was ice cream made to look like spaghetti and meatballs with strawberry sauce. It was really good.  Overall, this was a good meal. The atmosphere was wonderful. I would get the pizza lasagna again but just split it with someone.",

The pasta was tasteless, the sauce wasnt sweet or tangy, the chicken had none of the piccata \"kick\" (from lemon).  The coffee tasted like hot black water.  The gelati i had was amazing.

    "text": "I really wanted to love Trevi but now, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I reserved our seat via OpenTable.  It turned out that a reservation was unnecessary as the restaurant was basically empty when we arrived (albeit early). We were promptly seated by the fountain.  I should say that service is fantastic!   The waiter provided a bucket of some kind of 'bread' which none of us liked but I was too hungry to argue. I'm a firm believer that you can judge a restaurant on it's bread. And Trevi was failing early on.  My wife ordered the salmon, my daughter ordered spaghetti (sauce on the side) and I Veal parm.  I'll start with the great - My Veal was exceptional - nearly every time I've had Veal Parm at a restaurant it has been underwhelming at best and like cardboard at worst.  Trevi's was simply amazing.  They should make this a signature dish. Kudos to the Chef.  Our daughter loved her spaghetti - however it came out wrong at first and had to be remade.  My wife's salmon was 'average'. It was cooked properly but lacked any flavor. And it was on a bed of black crunchy something. She fished all the salmon pieces she could off the plate and left everything else.  Dessert menu was passed around and surprisingly our daughter passed on it. If a seven year old passes on sugar, something is wrong with the options. So we asked for the check and left.  What I discovered later is what left 'the bad taste in my mouth'. I received an email via OpenTable roughly 20minutes after we had been seated at Trevi stating that our reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant. I didn't notice it till I got back to the hotel later the same evening. I'll leave it up to you to decide why that might have happened.",

IMO meatballs (2) were very good. selected apps only $6. i loved the Bellini ($4) and beer too, location nice in the forum area. all in all would visit again if at CAESARS.",

    "text": "Caesars is not exactly the place to look for bargains, but the twenty-dollar two-course lunch at Trevi is one of the best deals in Las Vegas.  Our first course was the Trevi Salad which was delicious, far above the level of chop salads at most restaurants--they use a vinaigrette which is flavorful and not over-powered.  My second course was the Papardelle Bolognese which was also delicious and more food than I could finish--our waiter had warned us the portions were large.  My wife had the Margherita Pizza and she loved it.  Our sever Christopher was friendly and helpful.  The tables \"outside\" are a great place for people-watching as everyone comes to check out the \"Fountain of the gods\".  I wish we had been in Vegas another day as I would have loved to try dinner here, the Frutti di Mare caught my eye.  We would not hesitate to return to this restaurant.",

After eating there, I found out it was bought by Landry's, the Wal-Mart of restaurants, and I'm not shocked. The quality has dropped that low and the employees seem like they are held captive. My food tasted frozen & reheated, with an added bonus of burned edges on my pasta. PASTA. I get your rent is high & you think you can survive off of one-time only tourist patrons... but welcome to 2014. There is Yelp & the internet to keep you on your toes. Not to mention locals will dine there too and remember 12 years ago. Keep this up & you won't be able to pay that rent & be gone. Boo.",

We were able to get an Open Table reservation here quickly so headed over.  We had a choice to sit inside the restaurant or on the \"patio\".  I chose inside because needed a break from the loud and smoke filled Vegas mall atmosphere.  Probably a bad choice.  Maybe the energy and people watching on the patio would had added a little to our experience.   Our server was only a little interested in the table.  Very long wait for food and empty water glasses.  They were not even all that crowded.  The food was mediocre.  Just about what I would expect at an Olive Garden.  Edible (sort of) but certainly not what I expected.   Might be fine for drinks and deserts (the deserts looked and smelled great) but I will not be going here again for dinner.",

    "text": "Although the restaurant was extremely busy, we had a 7:30pm reservation and were seated right away. This is a big plus for me. Few things irritate me more than a restaurant incapable of estimating their table turns accurately enough to honor a reservation. I figure if I both take the time to make a reservation and make certain the entire party is punctual, the least the restaurant can do is be ready for us.  The constant murmur of the crowds shuffling through the cavernous Forum Shops and sounds of moving water intended to calm (or distract) said crowd, create an acoustical challenge for every fine dining house on the premises. So, when the host offered to seat us inside the restaurant in lieu of the patio, we jumped at the chance. Normally, this would have provided a quieter setting for four friends who only see each other once or twice a year to catch-up over a great meal and a bottle of Chianti.  Unfortunately, a private party upstairs (directly above our table) made it difficult to pose questions to our waiter, much less, enjoy our usual robust, fast-paced, multifaceted conversation.  That said, Jenner and his crew provided superior service on this crowded, particularly busy night. I particularly appreciate his recommendation that we stay clear of the sole. I wish, however, he had also suggested we consider one of the pasta or beef entrees over either of the veal dishes two of us chose.  Although the sous chef prepared a magnificent white wine, vegetable and mushroom saute that enhanced the flavor of the veal without being overpowered by garlic or butter, my veal was tough -- completely inconsistent with our overall impression of this, otherwise, excellent dinner house.  One of my dining companions was similarly disappointed by the main ingredient in his veal parmesan. Waitstaff comfortable enough to be honest with us about the sole is a good indicator of both confident management and an excellent restaurant which leads me to believe the substandard veal dishes were an anomaly.  My other two companions loved their meals: a salmon dish and a veggie pasta entree respectively. The four of us also shared an excellent chopped salad before the entrees arrived and an unbelievably delicious Tiramisu for dessert.  While dinner on this particular occasion was, at best, a Two-and-a-Half Star experience, I'm inclined to believe Trevi would normally earn a Four Star rating.",

    "text": "Catching up on some shopping while here at the Forum Shops inside the world famous Caesar Palace; Trevi struck my fancy. Located or considered part of the Fountain of the Gods Fountain this picturesque restaurant is what is for dinner!  This being a heavy touristy spot and flashes from cameras going off all around me; it is still enjoyable. The Fountain drowns out the music from the Forum Shops, which the sound of running water is suppose to be calming and stimulating. I feel the tranquility.   The staff here are seriously busy and constantly moving. There is a hostess that will seat guests, plus the servers will double and cover the hostesses duties as well. The teamwork present between the staff here is cohesive and cooperative. The amount of guests that want to dine here could seem to overwhelm the staff. Not here the teamwork amongst the employees keeps the everything running in synchronization.  The lunch special that they advertised; which is two courses. The first course being a light item such as the house or Caesar salad. The second course is a little heavier with choices ranging from pasta to pizza. For the first course the Caesar salad was great. The dressing was very light as I asked for. The second course the Ravioli alla Vodka. It was not a hard choice. The Vodka and the servers advisement was sealed my decision for the second course.  The Ravioli alla Vodka has a sensational color to it. The taste of the Ravioli is just amazing. The cheese inside of the ravioli is so balanced. They use fresh Parmesan to top off the dish. It is very impressive; and tastes delicious. The Ravioli are stuffed here there is no freeze dried anything. I asked the server how they prepare it. I was curious.   The cost of the two course lunch special is a fantastic price for only $20. If one is on a budget lunch is a great time to sample some of the offering of the menu.   With it being Friday and the afternoon I felt cocktails were appropriate; so I had a House Sangria. This drink was disappointing since it lacked the flavor and taste that other Sangria's I've had. Being familiar with top shelf liquor; not sure if it was a fluke. I decided to find out so after a second one I switched from drinking Sangrias to another type of drink.  By changing the variety of drink this one tasted so much better. I am drinking the Aperol Pear Spritzer. The name screams class and elegance; plus I love the flavor and pairing with Aperol. That is much better. This drink even looks better. The Aperol gives it that basking orange glow. This one was just right.  Some final thoughts: Great place for dinner or lunch. The fountain of the Gods is so amazing to sit and listen too as you bask in the brilliant faux sky from above. The sky actually changes too from time to time. The drinks are so-so. I do not recommend the Sangria at all. The service and food is amazing. The service is stellar. The reason I gave five stars for this review was for the amazing team work that the employees continue to display; wave after wave of customers. They do it with a smile too. Who could ask for!",

She had a little attitude to her. We were a little boozy already so we skipped the drinks and went straight for the food.   + Calamari Fritti - 10/10 - very good! Super crispy and light. The marinara and the aoli sauces were both good.   + Fried Mozzarella - 10/10 - delicious fried cheesy goodness.     + Chicken Parm - 10/10 - the chicken was thin with a nice breading on top. It was covered in a ton of delicious cheese. The marinara pasta was good too.   + Seafood Pasta (the most popular dish) - 9/10 - full of seafood including mussels, shrimp, scallops. It's in a light cream sauce. The dish has gotten a little smaller over the years so minus one star for that.   We skipped dessert but overall it was a great meal. We'll be back again!",

The peach Bellini didn't have much alcohol but was still very tasty.

Pretty much every restaurant, including Cheesecake factory had a wait, so we ended up settling for Trevi since the wait time was the shortest.   The restaurant is located right by the fountain in the middle of the forum shops so there's a lot of foot traffic and noise especially if you're seated outside. It's nice if you like to people watch I suppose. It's pretty pricey for what you get, but it's expected since I'm guessing the rent is pretty high. I ordered the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass for $34 and it was pretty good I'll admit, but pricey for the portion.   Would I return? Probably not, but it's not a bad spot if you're in a hurry and want something nicer than foodcourt food.",

    "text": "Trevi as the name suggests is right next to the fountains of the Gods.It is part of the forum shops at Caesars. They serve the usual italian fare, food is good but one must go to experience the beauty of the restaurant.  The patio is ideal for an intimate setting.Perfect place to take your date :) Happy hour is nice my favourite is the frozen peach bellini you can sip on these for hours while enjoying the beauty of the changing skies at forum.  I recommend going during happy hour if you want the experience without spending too many dollars $$$ (it is Vegas after all and the money just seems to vanish).  Try going during Lunch because evenings are super busy and you might need a reservation. They also have a gelato bar and don't forget to wish at the fountain.  Cheers!",

We sat at the bar and had Ryan as a bartender, he was so friendly. He was very helpful while I was tying to find vegan options. They actually have a vegetarian & vegan menu which was a total bonus!   The Pom cosmo was super yummy and for happy hour the price was great.   My husband did the lunch combo -- Caesar salad with a margarita pizza. The salad was a nice portion and the pizza was delicious!   I had the spaghetti agilo e olio with bruschetta (no cheese obvi). The bruschetta was perfect and the spaghetti (from Ryan's recommendation was even better)   This may have been my favorite place we dined at during our Vegas stay.   Go go go !!! You will enjoy :)",

The ambience is second to none we were seated next to the fountain of the gods a Romanesque fountain with the huge statue of Poseidon holding a trident.  The service is incredibly attentive the menu has many choices being that I am a keto power I decided to have the bone in ribeye steak. I was at first apprehensive and dining here with my colleagues because of it being an Italian restaurant but make no mistake that was probably one of the best ribeye steaks I have ever had in my entire life, I am a carnivore I eat steak very often I've had it in the best restaurants in Chicago and many in the Chicago suburbs. The ribeye steak I receive this evening at Caesar's Palace was phenomenal. Perfect marble is station it was cooked to perfection it was seasoned to perfection the bone was very slight, the flavor was incredible such a delicious perfect steak I have never had a better steak before this and that speaks volumes.  It came with its own sauce I cannot remember the name but it was olive oil and garlic and butter similar to a chimichurri but different, I also asked for a horseradish cream sauce let me tell you that was fantastic delicious taste of horseradish, without a bite it was warm and cooked my steak perfectly. I cannot recommend highly of this amazing restaurant was great ambience The quality and the attentive service made the price extremely reasonable for what you got.  You cannot go wrong here everyone at my table of nine people enjoyed what they ordered from pasta dishes to seafood everyone enjoyed their meal the wine selections are fast and the mixed drinks were made with perfection water was constantly refilled the bread was hot crusty and fresh and the accompaniments Such as olive tapenade, artichokes, bruschetta, sweet peppers everything was perfect delicious and added to an amazing experience.",

They have indoor and outdoor seating, but the family and I wanted outdoor seating and the host put us right by the fountain, yay! The menu consisted of Italian food and came with free complimentary bread. The bread was great with their seasoning and olive oil (I believe) for dips. We ordered two appetizers to start: calamari and bacon-wrapped meatballs. Both were perfectly flavored and were really enjoyable.  The entrees arrived not too long after. I got a comforting lasagna while everyone else got different types of pasta. The lasagna was splendid and was probably the second best lasagna I ever tasted. Everything cost under 200 so that was fine for Vegas dining especially at Caesar's Palace. Honestly it's good for a one-time experience and I'm glad I was able to try it out.",

The restaurant was a little hard to find when you are not familiar with this mall.    I had a 5pm reservation, was greeted and I was able to sit in the atrium area - close to the fountain.  It was a little loud but not overbearing.    Blake, the main server, and the trainee, had greeted me within a few minutes, went over the menu and took my drink order.  I had opted for the Caesar Salad for an appetizer and then the Pollo Arrosto for my entree.  The food runner had brought the salad few minutes later.  The salad was the right size for an appetizer.  Delicious - really like the croutons.  BTW... the bread is dangerous - excellent.  Few minutes later, the main entree was delivered.  Overall, it was very good.  The skin was very crispy.  The only small complaint was, the chicken was a little dry. Unfortunately, I did not save room for dessert.    Overall, the staff was very attentive.  The food and the atmosphere were good. I would recommend this restaurant.",

We were admittedly a little misled by the electronic board advertising Happy Hour (bar-only apparently) but had already been led into the restaurant....hmm...  No worries though, our waiter was accommodating to our light snack needs, perfectly fine bringing us just a dessert menu. We settled on a sorbet sampler and a few cappuccinos. The cappuccinos were well made and accompanied by a crispy almond biscotti - yummy! The sorbet was also very refreshing - strawberry and lemon were our runaway favorites. Pomegranate left something to be desired, the flavor was just too subtle.  Despite being a \"dessert only\" order, we still received full service (got complementary bread and olive oil!) which was nice. We also weren't rushed out and were able to sit and enjoy the food and ambiance.",

It's literally located by a popular photo spot. We opted for \"outside\" seating. Perfect atmosphere with the faux sky and people watching.   Went on a Monday night for dinner. Boyfriend and I looked at their online menu (obtained from their official website) and we had our heart set on a couple items...only to find out when we're actually seated that the Spinach Artichoke dip was no longer available. What!?! =( Even our waiter was like \"yeah it was a really good dip too.\" Okay now...if it was really good, why did the chef remove it!? Boo. Not good.  So we settled on a different appetizer instead. We got the POLPETTI DI GRANCHIO-crispy crab and pasta balls with marinara-like dipping sauce. This was delicious! I tasted more crab than pasta. It looks like the pasta was little macaroni so it wasn't too noticeable. It was so good I forgot to take a pic of this.  We also got a Caesar salad and pepperoni pizza to share. The pizza was delicious....thin crust with some basil added which was a plus. Almost a perfect rating but the pizza was on the smaller side. Even with the two of us, and we're light eaters too, we were able to completely finish it. Plate completely empty. We each had 4 slices but they were very small. (almost like kid sizes) So 4 slices here is like 2 slices at a Dominoes or Grimaldi's Pizzeria.  Since I'm always here shopping...we will definitely be back. There were some pasta dishes/chicken parm I want to try next time.",

I had the fettuccine pollo carbonara. It was creamy and cheesy. The chicken and mushrooms had such amazing flavor. He had the pappardelle bolognese and couldn't stop gushing about how good it was. The sauce was meaty and peppery. And the pappardelle was cooked perfectly. A fantastic way to end the evening. We can't wait for the opportunity to go back!",

The food was over all - fairly safe italian food (although the calamari appetizer was pretty good).  Nothing to write home about but definitely not bad food.  Plus - you sit under the painted skies near the indoor waterfall and watch the folks go wandering by snapping selfies and facetiming while walking (or was it facebooking live).  It's Vegas you see weirder stuff.",

We were not disappointed. We were greeted very warmingly and seated immediately at a table right beside the fountain. A fresh basket of bread and olive oil was brough to us to munch on.  We decided to order a couple of brick oven pizzas and a bottle of vine. How could you go wrong with that! The pizza's crust was thin and had the perfect amount of sauce, cheese and toppings. Relaxing by the fountain, enjoying the pizza and sipping on some wonderfful Vino was just what the doctor ordered. Service was perfect for the occassion and we were never rushed. Next time I'm at Caesar's again, I'll stop in at Trevi's.",

The pizza here was delicious. It's hard to describe, but the crust is very thin and not at all hard. The toppings and sauce were very good as well. The hostess was one of the most beautiful women that I have ever seen, which isn't a bad detail, either.  The waiter we had seemed a little lost and overwhelmed. Took awhile to get refills and awhile to get our check.  The food makes up for the so-so service that we had.

It's located inside the Forum Shops of Caesars Palace. It's beautiful as you walk in with the architecture. It has a blue-ish tint to the scenery. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night. But I just didn't like the overall vibe, the ambience, or the food... For drinks I had the raspberry dream which was a bit too sugary for my taste. For the appetizer we had the calamari and a Caesar salad. The calamari wasn't anything spectacular or memorable. I had the sea bass for my entree which was just alright. Overall, I think the decor was gorgeous but it wasn't anything to rave about once inside the restaurant. My service staff was just so so a well. I would not recommend this place.",

I went to this one because the price was 2 dollars cheaper for the same size. The other place also didn't have that many flavors I wanted to try. Personally I love all the fruit flavors and am not into the heavier chocolate and vanilla flavors. I sampled the watermelon, pineapple and strawberry. They were all good!  Refreshing and not too sweet. Texture was a little icier than I would have preferred but I enjoyed it nonetheless.   I ended up getting the two flavors of the day, watermelon and pineapple, in a small cup. They accept credit cards but she was eyeing me when I signed the receipt hoping for a tip?  Maybe when I'm not a student and am poor myself.   The gelato stand is a little hidden. It's small and to the side of the restaurant. Next time I come to cesars I definitely want to try the restaurant out. Food there looked pretty good.",

Seemed like the only time she was happy was when she added the gratuity to our bill. In my opinion, if your paying by credit card, you should never take the check presenter before the guest leave. Just my 2 cents. Also, learn to serve dishes the correct way, and serve women first.... Especially if you have the full tables order ready.  The tiramisu and calamari was good, the \"imported Italian pasta\" was terrible. Shrimp was Horribly over-cooked, and shouldn't be called a special at all. Definitely not worth 30 bucks. Pork osso buco was not good either, it wasn't tender at all! and lacked flavor. However, the risotto portion of the dish made up for the rest thankfully.   This place was really disappointing. The location is great, and so is the ambiance. Definitely good place for people watching. Food gets a big thumbs down except apps and dessert.",

We found that the menu offered the right amount of options and that the prices were extremely appropriate for the quality and portion size.  The waiter suggested the house risotto (featuring Gorgonzola, roasted garlic and pine nuts). It was outstanding. The texture was perfect and the flavors were melded in total harmony. It was certainly a worthy recommendation.  The shrimp scampi was another recommendation that was a home run. The shrimp were tender and filled with garlicy goodness. It is easy to overcook scampi and this dish was not. It was a great example of technique and knowledge by the chef.  The wine list offer something for every course and every wallet. We had a Malbec that was the greatest complement to our dishes.  All said and done, we walked away with satisfied tasted buds and satiated appetites. We will definitely keep Trevi in our Vegas rotation.",

We were originally planning on eating at the M Buffet, but we arrived in Vegas a couple hours late, so we were no longer able to fit it in our schedule.  We were staying at Forum Towers at Caesars, so we decided eat somewhere close.  I'm glad that we decided to do so, otherwise we may never have given this place a try.  First off, the prices are a bit high.  So it's definitely not somewhere to go if you're looking to save some money.  But it's also not so high that your wallet will want to punch you in the mouth.  But it's Vegas, so you should expect to spend a bit more money than you would at home.  I don't know if I've ever spent ~$20 on Fettucini Alfredo before coming to Trevi, but the pasta was damn good!  So I definitely came away satisfied.  My wife got the stuffed eggplant, and we shared the crab, spinach & artichoke dip.  We enjoyed everything.  The cheese was amazing on the stuffed eggplant, so I think I'm going to try their lasagna next time.  The ambience was also really great.  We sat near the fountain which was really cool, and we were able to people watch.  There was also no wait on Friday night at 9pm.  So that was very convenient for us since we were meeting up with friends later that night.  We really enjoyed our dinner at Trevi, and we'll definitely be dining here again.",

Overall i have to say this is a place everyone must go to atleast once during there stay in vegas. You wont be disappointed! I had the option to go with 3 other places, but there food wasnt up to par like trevi.   Thank you everyone at Trevi for everything!",

They told me to pick a spot and since we were walking through Caesar's Palace, I just let my nose lead us. It led us to Trevi's. We all fell in love with the calamari!! Also the Crab/spinach/artichoke dip was awesome!!! The drink menu also has some very nice drinks on it. Since then I have been back to Vegas 3 times and every time we get off the plane, we drop off our stuff and go straight to Trevi's. But now we get the Fritto Misto!! Try it!!! My mouth waters every time we talk about it!! The place does get busy though.......so if you are impatient....go some where else!!!",

    "text": "This place is truly a DISASTER, A Big Tourist -Trap, I would avoid if you can. First of all it's noisy if you want to have a conversation by the fountain, I was alone so it didn't matter to me but impossible to even hear the waiter describing the specials. Lighting is bad so you cannot read the menu's without your phone in Flashlight mode. I ordered an app and Pasta with meatballs, they forgot my appetizer and then my food arrived...looked like the meatballs were sitting under a heat lamp and they were dried out like falafel would be, the pasta was \"LITERALLY\" Charred and blackened. I sent it back and they appeared to have changed the pasta and sent back the same meatballs. I sent it back a second time and ordered another dish which came out cold. The assistant manager offered no appology, a dessert or coffee as a gesture. The waiter was aloof and simply didn't listen well...NEVER AGAIN!",

It is a nice place to sit and relax after walking the strip or shopping all day. The minestrone soup, pizza, bread, salads, etc were all 2 steps higher than an Olive garden, but not as ritzy as say Spago. Save the money and the long wait in line and just eat at Trevi.",

While the wait to be seated outside is a little bit longer than seating inside, being in the restaurant is just as pleasant and frankly might garner you even quicker service when you are starved. Attention to customer service was superb. Service super fast and with a smile. Food was no better or no worse than expected for the price in Vegas -- fast-food meets high end decor type of an establishment. Pleasant music and clean establishment makes for a must stop on your dinner plans with family.",

    "text": "Spending the afternoon cruising the forum shops @ Caesars we stopped for a late lunch here. Things started slow and had me worried but things came together by mid-meal.  You can sit \"indoors\" at and around the bar area or \"outside\" on the patio next to the Atlantis water fountain...if water noise is soothing for you than definitely sit near the fountain. The fountain will also drown out a lot of the people noise since Trevi is located near a heavy activity hub in the forum shops.  We were attended to quickly and seated...took about 5 minutes for a waiter to show up for us even though there were only 5 tables of people for 3 waiters to handle.  When we were helped our waiter seemed not interested in his job and it took another 10 minutes to get water. We stuck it out and started out with an order of their made-in-house Polenta fries...never had them before and I'd have to say it would be hard to beat these...so good...  Our waiter got a lot better as our meal continued...maybe he had something or someone else giving him a rough time but since service got better I won't let it affect my rating.  My friend ordered the Caesar salad which, besides being a HUGE portion, was well presented and richly flavored. Fresh as could be. I went simple with a margarita pizza...one of the best brick oven fired pizzas I've had. Light, flavorful, and fresh. Everything was better than we expected,  While the service did improve I will say that the food far exceeded the service here. If you're not in a huge rush definitely stop here for good food and people watching.  You've got to get the homemade sorbetto...I don't know what it is but no matter where I've gone in Vegas...good service or bad...crap entrees or good...every dessert I've had has been off the charts good. Trevi follows suite...even with a plain sounding vanilla I was hooked.  Spend-o-meter: very reasonable for 2 people...we hit a little over 50 after tip. Service: Got better after a really rough start...not counting that I'd say it was B service...count the bad service I'd give it a C/C- Portions: Large on the salads...ideal on personal pizzas and desserts... Food quality: A+ Will I go back: Yes...good views, awesome decor, and so much to try on the menu...I also think my bad service experience was a one-off issue based on many of the reviews already here.",

Well naturally we head to Caesars Palace, hoping for a great find.  We head to Trevi, and for what looked like a busy night, got seated impressively fast.  But I would soon be disappointed, when it must've taken about 10 minutes for someone to finally get around to asking us if we wanted anything to drink.  Not to mention, we were helped by about 4 different guys in the entirety of our stay.  Some of which we politely asked about twice if we could please get extra sets of silverware - apparently we were seated at a table that was far from being prepared for the next party.  I dont know if it was the time ( it was only 10-early in Vegas ) but some of those guys must have seriously been drunk,  at some point, the guy picking up our plates dropped a knife down the back of my chair!  Food was ok....in my opinion, its hard to remember food when the service overpowers your experience. Dont know that I'll ever give it a second chance.",

It is located in a beautiful location next to the Fountain of the Gods at Caesar's Palace Forum Shoppes.  Our server was excellent but the food was far from it.  My son had garlic mashed potatoes for a side and they were like a large mountain of flavorless rough potatoes.  I ordered the Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  It was also totally bland with no taste whatsoever.  I had to load it down with salt to get any flavor at all.  For dessert, I ordered my favorite Italian dessert, Tiramisu, which was dry as a bone and not much flavor either.  The only highlight of this dinner was the beautiful atmosphere and the Peach Bellini I savored more than my meal.  To top it all off, my son and I both got sick to our stomachs that night.  Was it food poisoning?  What a sad ending to my birthday in Vegas!  We were very disappointed as we had planned this vacation and special dinner months in advance and reserved on Open Table for this dinner, as we had read many good reviews of Trevi.  I would not recommend it.  Hopefully I choose a better dinner spot for my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fb.day&s=3f4661b1b92308fe36beee4be32398953e580a7e697b63dd1f02bd5c08d96248\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">b.day</a> dinner in Vegas this year!",

He doesnt like to be seen when he eats so we ended up in the indoor dining area which is also very nice. Its nice and cozy with a contempory style. We had a great booth near the bar which had flatscreens that had the Warrior game on. I had the Chicken Marinato pizza which was the bomb, cant go wrong with anything that has pancetta. They have a blended martini there called, I think lemontini or something like that! Its very refreshing and not too sweet like typical \"fru fru\" drinks and a must when eating at Trevi. Its a creeper so watch out!! Overall great service, great food and a great experience. Its a little bit on the pricey side but portions are a good size so you can always share.",

Service was cheerful, attentive, gracious -- two of the best servers we've ever experienced when dining out. The fresh, homemade Mozzarella Fritta was a great starter and the Rigatoni Bolognese and Filet dinners were all perfectly cooked, flavorful and delicious. Nice wine list with bottles at various price points. We had an Italian Chianti that went well with everything, including our gelato dessert. It can be hard to choose where to go in Vegas but Trevi truly has a menu item (pizza, seafood, chicken, pasta, steak) for every taste-bud in a unique, colorful, & fun people-watching setting.

As I approached the greeter and asked her a question, she was very dismissive and rude. I  then asked to speak with the manager. As he approached me, I extended my hand to greet him and say hello. Not only did he look at me as if he was disgusted that an intelligent African American woman wanted to speak to him concerning the rude behavior of one of his employees, but then he began to yell at me and threaten to call the mall security. However, when another Caucasian couple walked up, he greeted them with a smile. Once the couple walked past me, he guarded the entrance and said, \"I know your kind. All you people want to do is start a fight. I looked at him, and replied, my kind? Interesting....have a blessed day. PLEASE SHARE THIS. DON'T SUPPORT TREVI IN LAS VEGAS...RACIST, RACIST. RACIST!!!!",

    "text": "Came here for New Year's Eve dinner based on reviews and was not impressed. Service was terrible (but slightly made up for later...). They couldn't find my OpenTable reservation when we checked in and then it took about 15 minutes to be greeted after we were sat at this awkwardly placed table that was too close to another table and right next to the bar and main traffic paths. When our server came over, there was no apology for the delay - just, \"can I get you something to drink...\" Very unfriendly. I started with some coffee (which looked like tea water...) and my husband had a cocktail (which actually came really quickly). We ordered the bacon wrapped chicken meatballs & fried zucchini strips to start. Everything came out really fast, which was nice, but the chicken was dry and un-seasoned. The zucchini was good, but came with this measly side of marinara that wouldn't have lasted for a fourth of the dish. We asked for another side from the expo who brought the apps, but that never came. Then asked the waiter, who did bring one. That one didn't last that long either, so we asked for another and chatted with the waiter about how the portion of marinara to zucchini was not right. He agreed, then said he had a larger side container...but it didn't matter by then.  We split the seabass for an entree. It was plated well; the parsnip puree & crispy brussell sprouts were super tasty. Adding in sliced green apples was a unique twist, but the seabass itself was under cooked and hard. By this time, we just wanted to get on our way. We mentioned it to our server to let the kitchen know. He offered to re-make it, but we weren't interested in that. So he gave us a free dessert of choice (thus the \"make up\" for service and two stars). We had vanilla & pistachio gelati which was tasty and went on our way.  This is set in the Forum Shops, so it's loud, but good for \"outside - inside dining.\" I would not recommend based on this experience.",

The pistachio was off and had the consistency of a mousse today. It didn't keep it's form well and ran all over the place, but the flavor was good. The copious amount of chopped up nut sprinkled on top gave a nice variation in texture. For under $5, their small is about the same as two scoops at most ice cream shops.  If they let the gelato set more before putting it out, there would be no complaints here.",

Between the fountain and all of the people surrounding you inside the mall (because let's face it, most of this restaurant is a \"patio\" inside the Forum Shops at Caesar's) it's hard to have a conversation and you're all packed together at small tables.  However, we had great service from the moment we stepped to the hostess stand until we left. We all loved the food and wine, and after awhile, you kind of forgot that you were eating in the middle of a mall.  Prices are high. This is Caesar's, so don't expect Olive Garden prices. The quality of the food is in line with the price. We'll be back on our next trip.",

The service was decent and the waiters were nice, but the food was unmemorable. I've eaten food at Macaroni Grill that wowed me more.  My Salmon dish did feature a perfectly cooked piece of fish, but the seafood risotto was boring and lacking flavor. Worst of all the dish came with only three tiny mussels and two shrimp. After reading the menu description of a delicious seafood mix, I was definitely disappointed with what I had.  Overpriced even for the Strip and nothing special.",

    "text": "I work at one of the retail store inside the forum shops and I heard my coworker says that trevi offers employee discount. She ordered Caesar salad with salmon in it for $10. So I decided to give it a try. One of the server at the bar took my order. He asked me do I want to add chicken in my Caesar salad and I told him I thought Caesar salad come with salmon because of the one that my coworker got. And he said probably that's because they gave the wrong order. He said they messed up lots of orders in the past few weeks. So I asked him to add some salmon in my salad. Then I received my bill. It was $24. I asked him why there's a such huge price difference. He said that because I add salmon in it, he could not ring up as Caesar salad anymore, instead, he ring it up as grilled salmon salad. He left me behind before I even finished my words. His attitude was really bad. Because I only had 30 mins for my lunch break so I left the restaurant. And then I opened the to go box, it turned out to be small amount of lettuce, cheese and one piece of salmon. He charged me $24 for that, Isn't it ridiculous. I don't understand why the restaurant would be so confident to mess up the orders and ring up random items. I would never go to this restaurant anymore.",

Being too lazy to walk all the way back to the car & having to do all that parking again, I decided to just stop here.  (Mind you I wasn't feeling all that great).  Ordered a margherita pizza... ended up not eating it b/c I was feeling so nauseous... BUT I will say that the staff was great & I felt bad b/c I had barely touched my food.  The bread w/ olive oil looked great, but didn't eat any.  The appetizer made me sick to my stomach (the smell was too much for me)... had I gone when I wasn't hungover, I probably would have had a better time.  :]  Overly priced italian food nonetheless.  Nice intimate setting & good for those w/ kids.",

The serving of calamari was very generous and the batter was very light and crispy. The chopped salad was delicious...glad we got the dressing on the side as it was very rich in flavor. The minestrone soup was just ok... Too many beans and not enough veggies. Maybe we got the bottom of the pot since we dined so late at night. Luis was our server and he was very attentive. We learned he was just learning to be a server after working in the restaurant for over 10 years. Good luck Luis!",

    "text": "Trevi - Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace  Prior to being diagnosed with celiac disease, this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It always provided delicious Italian dishes with a decent price tag and a great atmosphere. I love eating outside the restaurant (but in the mall) on the cobble stone street being able to people watch while enjoying a delicious meal and glass of wine.   We decided to stop there and have an early lunch one day while out shopping around. They do not have a dedicated gluten free menu but they were able to give me several options on the menu that could be prepared gluten free. While the waiter wasn't as confident about gluten free items, he was able to go back into the kitchen and talk with the chef about choices for me, which made me feel pretty good about eating there.   I decided on a filet and mashed potatoes. It's probably one of the safest dishes we can eat at a restaurant without getting glutened. The steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delicious. I wouldn't expect anything less from Trevi.   While they don't have a dedicated gluten free menu, I feel comfortable in saying that folks who can't have gluten but are able to explain and ask questions about their meal would be able to safely have dinner there without any problems.",

My boyfriend and his cousins had the lasagna pizza and it was insanely good!!! Talk about an explosion of flavors in your mouth! The deep dish crust covered in ground beef and tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella on top.... wow, just wow!  Lastly, I got to take a bite out of the Pollo La Griglia and it was soooo good! Once again the chicken was cooked perfect, the sauce on top was so creamy and tasty, with the capers and tomatoes... yummy. I can't wait to try this place again",

    "text": "This review if for the Happy Hour only - which is one heck of a deal. Cheap beer and relatively cheap cocktails are always welcome at a fancy place like Caesar's - with the crazy expensive Forum Shops all around this place the inexpensive HH was a great find.  2-6 pm and in the bar area only you can really get your drink on. Now, the martinis weren't great but I didn't think they were terrible either. There was a lot of booze which helps matters. Still, I think next time I will stick with beer.  I really did like the bar area - it's dark and set back a little from The Shops so you can have an intimate conversation or just hang out inside away from the heat. Of course, the \"outdoor\" dining area is way cool because you can see the sky change from night to day and back again. But, HH isn't offered in that seating area.  We had a fairly attentive frat-boyish server who was personable. He seemed a bit oblivious at times but he still got our drinks out to us with the quickness.   Would I be down to try to food and go for a dining experience? Sure. But really, it's all about the Happy Hour at this place so hit it up.",

I'd say don't base your decision on coming here on their basic menu (even though the carpaccio is fricken great) but come for the specials.   When I went there were three great specials a risotto, a pasta, and a protein so something for everyone.   The portions were great also and the staff is A rated in my book.   It's deep in the Forum Shops so it may be a little walking, check the map before you willy nilly walk around to get there cause you might be walking the wrong way or on the wrong floor.   They also have a selection of italian sodas and such that (for the price) are pretty good.   Also when I mentioned the menu was Italian inspired the decor was more asian influenced. Dark reds and black booths, the music wasn't too loud, which was nice, and the food all came out hot and delicioso!   Diverti!",

We had checked out a couple of other venues in the Venetian and some other hotels, but we just could not stop talking about Trevi.  I am so glad with did!  We had 58 people at our dinner and we had the entire upstairs (mezzanine) to ourselves.  When you walked up the stairs you came upon the seating chart and guest book as well as the bar and some highboy tables for the cocktail hour which lasted about 45 minutes.  It gave everyone time to walk around, take pictures with the fountain out front, chit-chat with people and find their seats.  We had 4 round tables and 3 rectangular tables (1 being the head table) and they were placed by the windows and around the side.  The decor and everything was setup perfectly and the best part was I didn't have to do any of it!  They had 3 dinner menu choices and we went with the Veneto.  The shrimp cocktail and bruschetta appetizer were amazing; my bridesmaid ate all of the shrimp cocktail from the head table!  The salads were nicely proportioned and dressed, but the entrees...WOW.  I had the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (A seafood medley of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions in a seafood cream sauce) it was absolutely delicious.  I ate as much as I could and wished I could have eaten more.  We also went with the cheesecake for dessert because neither my husband nor I are big cake eaters and we love cheesecake, so it was perfect.  As for beverages, we had an open bar, but some of our guests wanted shots, which were not included.  They made it very easy for them to open a side tab and kept track of everything.  The servers were fantastic, they were great with drinks and the timing of food was perfect.  The best part about Trevi, other than the food, was the service before, during and after the event.  We only went there once and that was to view and choose the venue, otherwise we did all the planning from home in Phoenix, Arizona.  Michelle made it so easy and she was great with responding to emails and questions.  They let us use their easel for our posterboard seating chart and my parents were able to go the day before to take all the centerpieces and decor over for setup.  Overall, we could not have been happier with our choice and I will recommend Trevi to everyone getting married in Las Vegas.",

Their menu choices are varied, and there's something for everyone. Each visit, I've tried something different, and whether it was pasta or salad or just appetizers, everything has been well prepared, tastefully presented, and delicious. I agree with the other reviewers regarding the great service - the wait staff seem to really like their jobs.  I love that you feel like you're actually sitting outside in Italy, almost forgetting that the garish neon, traffic and noise is as close as The Strip. They have a full bar and the drinks are always good. Their wine selection could be a little broader, but there are good choices. I'll continue to frequent Trevi.",

The atmosphere to start with was perfect. We sat right next to the fountain, the lighting is dim and the air is cool. I don't remember the last time I have felt so relaxed and comfortable at a restaurant.  Anyway, what makes the pizza so superb is the way the crust is warm, thin, and crusty but still soft on the inside. This comes from the fact they make their pizzas in a brick fired oven. The toppings were also fresh and they use real cheese not imitation. Very filling pizza as well. The tiramisu we decided to split three ways and it was perfect. The ladyfingers were soft but not soaked through with the coffee and the taste was just phenomenal.  When I make it out to Vegas again, rest assured I will be back to Trevi!",

I'm only giving 3 stars for this review because it's really hard to impress with Italian; there are so many restaurants that cook tasty Italian food, you need to do a lot to stand out.   Visually, Trevi looks great.  It's located in the Forum Shops at Caesers Palace.  1/2 of the dining area is \"outside\" by a fountain, and the other 1/2 is inside.  We chose the inside seating because the outside area is very noisy due to the pedestrian traffic in the mall.  The inside seating is only a little quieter, so if you are looking for a more intimate setting, this might not be the place for you.  The server was attentive, maybe overly so, but it was a little slow when we were there, so I can appreciate the fact he was really working for his tips.  Food was good, as noted above.  I had the pappardelle with meat sauce and meatball, and enjoyed it.  Our total bill came out a little high for this type of food, but hey, it's Vegas, so it's expected.  Overall, would recommend based on location primarily.",

The rest of the group had pasta dishes and one person ordered veil parmesan.  Everybody enjoyed their food.   We had two appetizers which I would not recommend--calamari and artichoke dip.

The reason this place doesn't get a 4 is because the pizza was not just not good it was BAD! It was edible for sure but not good @ ALL!

We were asked to leave our already-in-hand-drinks at the hostess station before we were seated, but they were glad to let us finish them and take them for us.  They offer complimentary bread service. The bread was a focaccia that was seasoned with something that tasted like croutons (odd, but enjoyable). At the recommendation of the water attendant and the waiter, I ordered the chicken scallopini. It was good. No complaints. It wasn't per say better than any other middle of the road Italian restaurant, but better than Olive Garden by a large margin. Everyone really enjoyed their dinners, which says a lot.   Like I said, service was excellent. The \"inside\" of the restaurant was very swanky, but I think I preferred the \"patio\" despite the raging waters. Restrooms were immaculate. When we notice we had forgotten our camera and asked for it, they had it in a drawer with 10 other cameras. Ha! I do wish they would have just given it to us immediately, they knew where we'd been sitting and we were standing right in front of them before we left. oh, well, not harm no foul.  Dinner for 5 with drinks was $200 before tip. Thanks for dinner Mike V. or should I say thanks to the Flamingo roulette table!?",

The food came out pretty quick we had the calimari as an appetizer and the Meatza pizza to share and they were all good. Would definitly recommend again",

The Fettuccine Pollo Carbonara is a deliciously creamy dish and the chicken is nicely grilled and very juicy.  I like the Spaghetti and Meatballs too.  It's flavorful and the meatballs were very tasty too (although slightly salty for my taste).  They give pretty big portions.  They have TVs in here so you can watch sports while eating.  The outdoor seating is absolutely beautiful.  It's surrounded by Roman marble statues and a huge fountain, all under the Caesar's Palace faux sunset sky.  I'm definitely coming back when I'm in Vegas again.",

They don't have carpaccio on the menu but he asked the chef and since they had the ingredients they did it for us. Since the chef was the only one to know how to do it he did it himself. And it was damn good! Thank you to chef Paul and Philip for going the extra mile. Food was perfect and we had a wonderful experience even though it was during busy Christmas season.",

    "text": "Oof...not good.  Hubs and I came here for a \"nice\" dinner after Michael Jackson One.  I was skeptical of a kitchy Italian restaurant in Caesars, but I thought it couldn't be that bad...blah.  It wasn't exactly BAD, but it just wasn't good.  The best part of the meal was definitely the bread!  The herbs on it were so good, and the oil was the perfect dipping sauce.  They kept it comin' too!  I ordered the lasagna and hubby ordered shrimp amatriciana.  She warned him that it could be \"spicy\" and suggested he get it with no spice so he did.  Unfortunately no spice = no taste.  The watery spaghetti noodles didn't hold any of the \"sauce\" so he was constantly trying to spoon it all together for an ideal bite.  I tasted the pasta and it literally tasted like nothing.  Not impressed.  My lasagna was equally unappealing.  It came to me on a large plate with a glob of congealed cheese on top - like it had been sitting for some time under a heat lamp.  Instead of being hot and fresh, it looked and tasted like yesterday's lasagna that someone threw on a plate, microwaved, and then forgot about.  The sauce was very weird as well - the sauce and the meat were separate.  There were little balls of beef sitting on top of the sauce under the noodles...and it just didn't look good.  It didn't taste good either....it was luke warm and tasteless.    We had been pumped to order dessert for our fancy night, but we ended up passing.  The dessert menu looked good enough,  but we were just too turned off after that dinner.  Also, wait staff was annoying.  We got there at 9:45 and they closed at 11.  Around 10:30 we had a waitress come by and ask us to swap her oil bottles - in my opinion, if you have closing work, you work on empty tables first and then move to other tables AFTER the customer has left.  We paid way too much for this meal and I would never, ever recommend it.",

It made me appreciate Italian food all together. This was the utmost best pasta dish I've ever had.  Last Impression: This place was to perfection from their cocktail drinks to their service. So cheers to this place for making it a wonderful experience to ending my first trip to Las Vegas before heading back to San Jose. This place is YUM!  Check out my photos I posted!",

I asked him why he wasn't coming around and he got irritated (place was not busy at all). We asked for extra bread and he acted like we were moochy. I have had bad service here before, but out of desperation we gave it another chance and it is no shocker that it sucked. We will go hungry before giving them another chance.

Chicken salad- Loaded with a lot of dressing and the chicken was alright but nothing special about this salad. I wish more restaurants would make better salads!!   Shrimp Angel hair pasta- It was alright but for some reason when we got our pasta it was cold!! I like pasta when it is nice and hot.

Pizza was just ok.  The only person that enjoyed had the beef short rib.   Service was terrible. Waiter was not friendly and very short / abrupt.  We had to seek him out when we needed something. Maybe it's because they charged 18% gratuity automatically?    There are many other dining options - I would find one and not eat at Trevi.",

My fiance had their margherita pizza, it was underdone and flavorless.  The calamari was good, but overpriced.  I had their signature dish, a fettuccine seafood pasta for $30.  The seafood tasted fresh and good.  But the pasta and seafood lacked seasoning.  I honestly think it was a can of alfredo sauce, dried pasta, and fresh seafood.  They killed the seafood by not seasoning it and with horrible pasta sauce.  For the price, it is not worth it by any means.  We decided right then and there that we would not be hosting our reception there and regretted the $90 tab.   In all honesty, I could've put together better food for cheaper.  Completely overrated, underseasoned, and overpriced food.  Disappointment.",

The first visit we had the meatballs wrapped in bacon, the fried mozzarella, and each had a bowl of soup-I had the tomato basil and my husband had the minestrone. Everything was delicious, especially the soups! The tomato soup was probably one of the best tomato basil soups I have ever had. And the dipping oil they serve with the bread? My husband said he'd bathe in it if he could.... The second day we had the fried eggplant crisps -which were fantastic-and we each had the same soups. Both days service was great, even on Christmas when it was packed. Guy was our server day 1 and D. was our server day 2-both excellent. We will definitely return on a future trip to Vegas.",

Situated inside the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops in vivaaaaaa Las Vegas, Trevi's gelato was a welcome surprise and discovery.  At first you might not notice it hidden around to the corner of the main restaurant, but the gelato here is molto squisito!  That's Italian for: holy crap this is yummers!!  It's so good, every time I come to Vegas now, I absolutely must stop by this place each trip to grab a generous helping of their very excellent tiramisu gelato.  I highly recommend it.  Real pieces of ladyfingers and just the right amount of rum soaked in - It's the most authentic tiramisu-flavored dessert that I've tried that isn't the real deal.  Of course there's other flavors to choose from but I'm a sucker for all things tiramisu so if they can make it this good, the rest has to be pretty good.  Actually, my friends tried other flavors and they agreed it's very good without having to resort to go to Italy.  Prices are reasonable at about $6 a pop.  But hey you're in Vegas, indulge yourself!",

It seemed a good choice as it was fairly reasonably priced with some lighter options - salads, pizzas, soups, appetizers.  The food is definitely not cheap but it was not outrageous, either, especially in comparison with some of the other options at Caesar's.  I opted for the Tuscan Tuna Salad.  It was a very good salad and completely hit the spot (I was searching for something light after eating a pretty large but pretty early breakfast, and drinking a Fat Tuesday drink).  The salad was large with fresh ingredients and a nice flavor.  The tuna added the protein to satisfy me and hold me until a later dinner.    The service was very prompt and friendly, and the setting inside the Forum is pleasant.  There is a fountain nearby and you can watch people while you're eating.  I didn't try too many things here but, based on what I did try, I would be likely to return if I was in the area and looking for a good bit to eat.",

I ordered a gigantic seafood salad.  It has shrimp, scallops, crab.... so darn tasty.  The pizzas were perfect, thin, crispy, stringy cheesy.    We looked at the wine list...really overpriced.  We recognized some of the wines, definitely not worth the price.  But way down somewhere in the menu, near the pizzas was a house \"pizza wine\".  The bottle was 20 some-odd dollars.  It was a light red, bubbly wine.  It wasn't sweet, it was actually quite refreshing and delicious.  Perfect for the ordered meal....",

You'll dine next to one of the flowing fountains underneath a sky scape. Food is delicious and priced reasonable. The service is great. It is one of my go to places in Vegas. They have salads, pasta, pizza and entrees. A little bit of everything for everybody.",

It took us about 1 minute to get seated (great!), our waitress was nice and pretty (Korean girl. we made a bet to find out what her ethnicity is!), and everyone had fun eating pasta and sipping wine, iced tea, gin and tonics, etc. Well, we had a good time. The food was just average but overall, the experience is great. Can't remember if we ever asked for the waitress's name but look for the cute Korean girl.",

This last time I went, it was with my CES crew, and it was not a romantic dinner.  The food here is decent, but the price is a bit higher than what I would expect for a restaurant in the Forum Shops.  The 3 of us ordered a main dish and a drink, and the bill ended up being over $80.  Not too expensive, but for what we got, it still seemed a bit high.  Maybe it was because we had \"outdoor\" seating.",

    "text": "Trevi was blah.  I made reservations online, which was great.  I suppose that was the highlight of the experience.  The service was fine, but nothing to write home about.  My two complaints are as follows:  Gripe #1:  The food was bland, bland, bland.  The portions were huge, so I had a big honkin plate of bland parmesan chicken.  But really, who needs three chicken breasts, plus pasta for dinner?  Same ginormous portions for the bread (which tasted like it came out of a bag) and creme brulee, same bland taste.  I left feeling like I paid a fortune for cardboard.    Gripe # 2:  The atmosphere was icky.  The restaurant is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's and we were seated \"outside\" on the \"patio\".  The restaurant wants to be higher end (hence the $30 chicken dinner and Pellegrino water), but it's situated as a glorified food court.  We were surrounded by shops (albeit high end shops...I love you Tiffany's!), so there were throngs of tacky drunkards wandering through in t-shirts too small while wearing guitars full of melted margaritas around their necks with a straw poking out the top.  Really.  A plastic yellow guitar around their neck filled with booze. Don't even get me started.  So not the experience I was hoping for on a bachelorette party weekend.  I give this place two stars, mostly because the service was fine and I didn't get food poisoning (that counts for something, I suppose).  Will definitely not be back.",

First, we ordered the Ribeye, only to find out 30 minutes later they didn't have any, secondly, when the steak alternatives arrived (an hour later), they were horribly over cooked.  Next is the veal, which was thick and undercooked, truly not what my family and I were expecting.   The staff was very courteous and apologetic, so no harm done there, but Trevi needs to improve their operations while there is increased traffic. We honestly felt as though they weren't prepared for the holiday rush and our $500 meal was scraped together with what they had left. A truly unpleasant dining experience.",

The cheese went really well with the acidic tomatoes, and I love pasta.  My boyfriend got the veal, which he said was okay, but I didn't get to try it. I got a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, and I can't remember the origin, but it was $12. Better than average, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Cabernet Sauvignon.

We were greeted by the hostess and asked which seated we preferred. They offered out on the patio, upstairs or inside the dining area. We opted for the upstairs dining since it wasn't in the middle of the shops but we still had a view of everyone.   We were seated and greeted by our server pretty quickly. Our server, Paul was very nice and polite. We started with the mussels as an appetizer. They were really good, only thing I guess I was expecting a cocktail fork (since we get them at other restaurants) but we were never brought any so we used our big forks which made getting the mussels out a little tricky. The bread served with the mussels was really good too!  I had the fettucine pollo carbonara, pretty much just like fettucine Alfredo with chicken. Not bad but nothing that stood out from others. Enjoyed the sorbetto (raspberry and lemon) for dessert. Sweet and tart! I actually did discover a new wine I liked, Row Eleven pinot noir. Very smooth and easy to drink, light.",

I had to choose something else under pressure and was not happy. When I looked to my right and saw the original dish I ordered on the patrons table next to me, I got angry.   I ordered a pizza and my friends orders salads and lasagna. We all enjoyed our food and I was actually satisfied. The waiter was quick and attentive and the food came out fresh.   We ordered desserts and they were also very good except that my fiend ordered an actual tiramisu vs tiramisu gelato which he got served and really didn't want- oh well!

It is expensive for just spaghetti (21-22.00 prices need updating on yelp pictures)- I asked instead of meatballs if I could have the bolognese sauce. It still came with a huge meatball and both were good and sauce was spicy which I liked. My son had fettucine carbonara with proscuitto,mushroom and peas which was very good. We had fried calamari with both marinara and tartar sauce with crisped greens( kale? ) which was sprinkled over the fried calamari- this was really good! And crusty bread to dip into olive oil with fresh garlic and herbs-yum, this was very good too! They had veal piccatta, scallopini, and marsala which I normally would have ordered, but I was craving spaghetti! I saw big pizzas being brought out and those looked delicious! So food was 5 stars, waiter we had (who looked like that MMA guy McGregor) was excellent and nice so 5 star service but gave 4 stars bc of the prices but that is a given bc I am sure it is expensive to rent/lease a space in that center!",

Once passed the mediocre reception our server Dan turned up our experience back into the 5 star direction. Service was outstanding. Thorough menu tour and very engaging. Loved our drinks! Mozzarella appetizer and tomato bisque we delightFULL. I had the Chilean Seabass and my hot date the seafood di' mar pasta as recommended by Dan.

We were seated quickly and had a very attentive waiter. My friend had a glass of wine and chose just water. The bread and olive oil was great. They had a small 3 course dinner menu special to order from, so for $35 I had salad, chicken carbonara and gelato. I enjoyed every bite of it and found the meal to be extremely filling. So filling that I had to curtail going to their bar for happy hour! My friend ordered the cheesecake and we laughed in shock at the enormity of the slice. She said it was amazing and she couldn't stop eating it! At 10:00 our waiter suddenly changed without notice though, he was a very nice man but service slowed down immensely. It was no overly busy and that was the only downside.",

When we arrived the hostess was ready to seat us and still offered us the option of the patio or indoors. We stuck with the patio. A little noisy, but hey its in the middle of one of the best malls in the country. My daughters started with bacon wrapped chicken meatballs. Everything is better with bacon and these did not disappoint. Not sure what was in the sauce, but their was not a drop of it left on the place. The girls then ordered the lobster ravioli and said it was one of the best. My husband ordered the Linguine ai Frutti di Mar and enjoyed every bite. I had asked for the short ribs, unfortunately they were out, so I ordered the Steak Tagliata,  sirloin medallions cooked medium rare and served with a corn hash. Not sure what all was in the hash, but it was one of the best side dishes I've ever had! Great drinks and the waiter brought us a tiramisu with a candle to celebrate our daughters birthday. Highly recommend for a special occasion or night out with others or your significant other!",

The food is served hot and is delicious. The wine list is very good as well. Prices are very reasonable, especially for a restaurant located in a major casino on The Strip.  Service is often an issue in the mid to low prices Vegas restaurants. However, we have dined at Trevi more than a dozen times over the past 15 years and we have never had poor service.  The atmosphere is great, with a faux Trevi Fountain as the central focus of the restaurant. People watching here is great too!",

Everything was so fresh hot and delicious the prices where very good and the bread and garlic olive oil is making my mouth water just thinking of it again.

After waiting at least 5 mins, our waiter showed up and I asked about it, and he seemed confused. He said he'd have to ask. When he returned, he said that it wasn't going on, but since I asked about it, his manger said to honor it. Seemed odd since it was clearly displayed on a large sign upon entering.  11 min wait for bread after we ordered. Entree was out 6 mins later. Waiter kept disappearing the entire time and didn't seem to work with a sense of urgency (tall Indian man with glasses and mustache) unless it was calculating how much tip other diners left him.  My linguini di mare seafood pasta was lukewarm. I assume it got cold waiting for my bf's dish to finish because his sea bass was steaming hot.  Bussers in dirty white jackets and ghetto busing station for dirty dishes with glasses stacked on the base of a light post. Worst meal of the entire trip. Expected more from Caesar's.",

They didn't send any of the other orders out. They didn't tell us our food was burnt and would be delayed until we asked if our food was coming. The waiter never came back to our table, and the maitre'd helped us instead.  My review would probably be better if we had actually gotten any food but my family was on a short time frame and had to leave, almost an hour and a half later, without eating.",

Caprese Buffalo Prosciutto salad Papardella Bolognese  Moscato  Pinot Griggio   Everything was delicious.   The meatball that came with the pasta was the BEST ever!!!    Our server Andre was super nice, attentive and helpful.  Definitely the best waiter I ever had at Trevi.  Looking forward to my next visit to Vegas so I can come back here!",

It was good, the chicken was very thin and a little dry. The Linguine with clams was yummy. The best meal was the Bone in RibEye.  Highly recommend that!!! We were stuffed so we passed on dessert but did it look good",

We chose the special $20 lunch menu which features an entree and a choice of salad or soup. The bread was soft and crusty served with olive oil. I chose the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. My alfredo sauce was smooth and creamy. The chicken was tender and the fettuccine pasta was the perfect al dente. D was an excellent server, he kept our peach bellinis filled and even accommodate  a child with complimentary ice cream because she could not indulge in the Bellini. This is my first time at this restaurant and I will continue to look for Trevi at other locations. Thank you D for an excellent Taste of Las Vegas in Caesars Palace",

    "text": "My friends and I wanted to go to a nice restaurant that was not super over priced for a friends birthday. This place would be the place to go.   I would give this place 4/5 stars but let me explain why I took away 1 Star.   We have called in advanced for a reservation. We were forced to wait 30 min for our table when we arrived. We were hoping to be seated outside near the trevor fountain inside Cesar's Palace. But glad we were seated inside because it was very loud. Once we were seated, the waiter tended to us right away. Got some appetizers which came out pretty quick.   But things started to go down hill for us. It was a Sunday night and it was not as busy. For some reason the waiter just took so long to come check on us every so often. Our food came out much later then I expected. Our first bottle of wine took some time to come out to us. But the second came out right away.   But I did appreciate that our waiter brought my friend a birthday dessert so kudos to him.   What did I think of the food? It was mediocre. I ordered the chicken carbonara and tasted more like chicken Alfredo.   But what made up for all this mess was that when we had finished with dinner, happy hour just started so we got our drinking in before heading out into night life.",

    "text": "--Atmosphere, Service, & Parking--- Located in The Forum Shops at Caesars, next to the Trevi fountain replica, I think Trevi fits the bill for a great high quality casual meal. I think the \"patio\" seating is where you should sit, which is perfect for people watching and checking out the atmosphere around. It surely doesn't hurt when you have wonderful fake blue skies above you either which adds on to the ultimate Vegas indoor vibe of never knowing what time it is.   We had some really nice service from a multitude of individuals with a team effort, easy to chat to and kind. If you're already at Caesars, then I'm sure you're parked, but if not they have a parking garage and valet when you enter the premises off Las Vegas Blvd. There are parking fees.   ---Food & Price--- I came for dinner and the menu features a lot of great varied items. Besides various appetizers and soups and salads, the menu is made up pasta dishes, brick oven fired pizzas, and entrees with beef, chicken, and fish options. Bread is served with some herb red pepper infused olive oil. We skipped appetizers and any starting items and just ordered entrees as we didn't feel too hungry.   Steak Tagliata - Sirloin, roasted corn, arugula, radish, leek salsa verde Really solid dish with tender meat, a great roasted corn salad, and the salsa verde was nicely done with its great acidic tones.   Party members enjoyed the capellini bianco, and the crispy skin salmon.   Everything is a pretty decent size, but if you're especially hungry the options might be a bit on the smaller side.   Prices: apps $7-15, soups and salads $9-23, pizzas $16-21, pastas $19-30, entrees $26-34.",

We arrived for dinner around 9 pm on a Friday night and was seated in our choice of patio or inside (I recommend patio) right away without reservations.   We were greeted with bread and olive oil/vinegar at our table, and chose to order the salmon entree (can't remember the name) and capellini bianco ($28 each) from their newly revised menu.   The food came out fairly quickly and was great, but could have been a little hotter. The salmon entree was small but the flavors make up for it. The capellini bianco is an angel hair pasta dish with shrimp and lump crab, light but creamy and delicious!  Service was great but a little slow. I guess many others like to take their time while dining but we wanted to eat and see other things.   Patio seating is definitely the way to go.  It may be a little loud, but you get a view of the fountain and see the changes of the forum skies throughout your meal.   We had a great time at Trevi and would love to return!",

I also downed two refreshing blended cocktail drinks--the peach bellini (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F2oiwvXG81qbop3f4tYu1yg%2Fl.jpg&s=468dbb7e37ea182ececdc9f9ef502519eb69efd809e0060cfe17b1f54b43e9ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>) and some sort of tropical drink (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FMOgntoG7R3myTEUEzj58RQ%2Fl.jpg&s=418aaebc0ca230b5a791e59b3b12ef1759fc9b1ee7ee94566a2c97525a09f1df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>). Kim F., my bf, and I all agreed that these were phenomenal--you could taste the distinct and delicate flavor of peach in the peach bellini, and the tropical drink tasted like fresh mangoes. My goal is to find drinks like that in the OC area. However, I am suspicious about the amount of alcohol these drinks contain. They taste pretty much non-alcoholic, and I was not even buzzed after finishing off two in about 30 minutes. When something seems to good to be True (i.e., alcohol that tastes delicious), it probably is!",

The lasagna was not good because it tasted like a 2-layer lasagna with pasta and beef. I want to enjoy the essence of a layered lasagna where I feel like I am biting into different flavors. I couldn't tell if I was eating cheese or lasagna noodles.   The ossobuco risotto was on the bottom of my risotto list. There was no creamy consistency in the rice nor was it al dente--too much bite left. Now I don't know if it was a bad night in the kitchen or what, but I did not enjoy my risotto whatsoever.   The calamari was mediocre though.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner before my friend's bachelorette party  festivities. We'd made a reservation because there were six of us, but when we arrived it didn't seem that busy. We probably could have done without the reservation, even though it was a Saturday night.   First they seated us \"outside.\" It was SO loud - to the point that we actually asked to be moved inside. I wouldn't necessarily recommend sitting out there, unless you're a bit closer to the restaurant side.  We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate - it was pretty good, but I forget the name. One girl in our group accidentally spilled two of the glasses; the server and bussers were helpful in immediately getting it cleaned up, but then the server brought two new glasses. That was nice of him, except then he charged $9 apiece. I get that you need to make money, but don't bring glasses, act like they're complimentary because we had a spill situation, then charge us. I'd have preferred he ask us if we wanted to pay for more.  I ordered the pesto fettuccine. It was meant to come with shrimp, which I don't eat, so I was able to order it without and pay less. It was good; definitely something I'd order again. One girl in our group really wanted fettuccine Alfredo, which they made for her even though it wasn't on the menu.   It was definitely good food; everyone was pretty happy with theirs. Our server was friendly and quick. The champagne situation was a little annoying but overall, it was a pretty good experience.",

I was starving going in and left plenty full but the food tasted like something you could get at olive garden. Paying a high price for italian food is dangerous, but I have experienced the wow factor before, this place just didnt deliver. I had the Linguine Vongole which lacked taste. The wife had the chicken carbonara which seemed to lack enough (any?) egg to bring out the True richness you would seek in a carbonara. Adding chicken to carbonara seems like a cheap attempt at improving it, but really just makes it a Alfredo. The menu even says it is a \"Parmesan cream sauce\". No classic carbonara uses an alfredo sauce.  Others had the special and the pizza. The pizza seemed good, the person that had the special seemed less than impressed.  On the other hand, the cannoli was legit and awesome.",

Literally steps from Caesars' casino floor, Trevi is also located in a convenient location.  Now, to the food: Fresh and tasty, Jessica chose salad, gourmet pizzas, and pastas. The buffet was beautifully arranged. Food stations were constantly replenished and plates were cleared promptly.  The one negative of the evening would have to be the noise level. The private dining area is on Trevi's 2nd floor, and between the din of the Forum shops and the piped in music, conversation was a struggle.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner, because we had a large party we sat in the outdoors area.  The indoor area was definitely a lot nicer!  The outdoor area didn't have enough A/C, so I wasn't as comfortable eating my food as I would have liked.   Plus there's always people walking by the forum shops and starring at you eating!  We started out with the calamari fritti and pizzeta trevi.  The fried calamari was excellent, lightly battered and deep fried to perfection!  It was served with this tomato caper sauce which tasted very good!  The pizzeta is like a flatbread; topped with some herbs and parmesan...it was light and tasted excellent!  The one VERY DISSAPOINTING thing was the free bread they served us, it was COLD & STALE bread!  Unacceptable for an Italian restaurant!  Minus 1 star for such horrible bread, honestly don't even serve bread if it's cold and stale, that's just terrible!   Plus they served it with olive oil, and no vinegar!    Moving onto the entrees, I tried their special of the day fettuccini.  It was a fettuccini with pancetta, sweet peas, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes in a cream sauce.   The dish was excellent!  It was heavy, rich, creamy, fattening, and loaded with flavor!  They definitely didn't skimp on the cream, butter, oil, or whatever base they used to make the sauce...maybe they used the fat from the pancetta to make the sauce...whatever it was, tasted excellent!  Probably the best fettuccini dish I have had yet!  Plus, the noodles where cooked al dente, just the way I like it.  The dish was a tad expensive at $32, I mean there really weren't any expensive ingredients used to make the dish, and the portion wasnt huge, but I would probably go back and order it again just because it was that good!    I also tried a little of the chicken parmigiana, which was ok but nothing special.  The seafood linguini wasn't bad, the seafood was fresh and the lobster cream sauce wasn't bad.  The deep dish pizza was disappointing, they need to add more cheese to the pizza; there was way too much dough and tomato sauce!   The meat lasagna was ok, it could have been bigger.   The fazzoletto trevi tasted excellent!  Out of all the dishes, I liked the pasta dishes the most, so I am guessing those will all be good dishes.  The other dishes were ok, but I have had better.    I thought he prices here are a tad high, I think it comes out to be around $30-35 a person if you share an appetizer or dessert.  The fried calamari is excellent! The pasta dishes were cooked perfect, but they could work on a few of their meat entrees and pizzas.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, reservations are definitely required!  I would also recommend sitting in the indoors area versus the patio, because there isn't enough A/C in the patio, and who wants a bunch of bystanders walking around and starring at your food while you eat! This restaurant would have deserved a 4 star if they didn't serve cold and stale bread to us, that's minus 1 star!",

The food was a solid 4, with the pasta being cooked very well, the meatballs as big as your head and the pizza cooked just right! It was well priced for the quality. There is no kids menu, but if you can think of a pasta dish they can make up a half order for the tikes. Other than that, we just simply had lackluster service. Drink glasses routinely hitting and sitting on empty, only seeing the waiter once after food arrived, etc. There was a table next to us that seemed to get the VIP treatment and this place may be a 5-star experience if you are \"that guy\". Literally had management going over to the table and multiple waiters to greet \"this guy\". Well, I had never seen him before, and don't you go to places like this, and pay prices like this, so you get that same kind of service? Overall, it was a good restaurant and we would probably go and try it again. It is A-OK.",

I also had a piece of the cheese pizza and it was very good.  The only thing that needs change is the prices.  Pasta is one of the cheapest things, yet my dish was almost 25 dollars.  It was delicious, but 25 for a single pasta dish is too expensive, even in Vegas.",

I had the chicken with artichoke and dried tomatoes over pasta while they had the polenta with chicken and my other friend i do not remember what he had. But he ordered an italian soda and didnt like it. I liked my dish but didnt love it and my other friend was not liking his plate at all. After we ate, we ordered a chocolate molten lava cake but the cake was very dry and hard. It was not worth $120",

    "text": "Trevi would not be a destination restaurant in Vegas nor would it be my first choice for a business dinner, which is the occasion that we were there. Trevi is situated in the the Forum Shops with majority of its seating in the mall. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable with its high ceilings, open kitchen and dark colors. Sitting in the restaurant rather than the patio is highly recommended. The dinning room keeps all the mall noise out and it feels more like a restaurant rather than apart of a mall food court.   The service was great at first with prompt delivery of menus, drinks, bread and appetizers. After the appetizers were served service became nonexistent. After receiving the bill, it turned out that the gratuity was already added. It was then obvious as to why our server began focusing his efforts on smaller tables...weather he sucked or not he was still getting his tip.   The food was not great or bad...it was just something to cure your hunger. We started out with the bread that they serve to each table and it really served no purpose but to fill your stomach with its complete lack of flavor. For appetizer we shared a couple of pizzas that were the best part of the meal. Despite the canned tomatoes on the margarita pizza they were very good. For dinner I ordered the bolognese pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the taste reminded me of Olive Garden. We all shared dessert. The Tiramisu, the hot molten chocolate cake and the ice cream were the highlight of the meal, with the chocolate cake being the best of the three.   Overall the food was bland, unexciting...really nothing special. The food is on the same level of Olive Garden, but the price is on the level of finer dinning. If you're thinking of Trevi for dinner, keep walking and go to Spago instead.",

Cute bartender Travis chatted us up at the bar, and then brought us a round of free yummy shots at the table (I think they were red-headed sluts but not sure).  I confess I am not the biggest fan of Italian food, so consider that with my review, but I thought the food was average.  I had the pizzetta trevi (like garlic bread) and the penne putanesca (very spicy).",

Even though it was night, the ceiling effect and temperature made it seem like a nice warm evening. We sat \"outside\" next to the fountain, which offered a nice scenic background. It kinda gives you that Italian experience. For appetizers we ordered the crab artichoke dip and fried calamari. Both were delicious. The crab in the artichoke dip offers a very different texture and taste to that appetizer.  All the entrees looked delicious! I ordered the Chicken Scaloppine, which was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan on lemony tastes so the lemon butter and capers gave the chicken a really delightful taste for me. I really enjoyed my meal.  All my friends said their meals were good. Every entree that came out was a good portion for each person. The table secretly let the waiter know that it was our friend's birthday, and he came out with this huge ice cream sundae. The waiter was so nice and took a group picture from the restaurant's camera. In addition he prints it out, posted it on a little cardboard frame, and had all the waiter/waitress sign it. It was a really nice gesture. Overall, a little pricey, but its Vegas!! The food and experience was excellent.",

I felt like they judged the four of us just because we ordered two entrees. Honestly, we were not super hungry and just wanted a bite to eat. Maybe next time, we should have been smarter and went for Earl of Sandwich or something.",

    "text": "Good food, but a little too pricey. Location is a trade-off.   First, let's deal with the location. The fountain can be great to look at and of course the people watching probably doesn't get much better. However... the fountain is loud, generates lots of humidity, and that section of the Forum seems to be a hot spot (temp wise). If you're near the fountain, you're likely to be in lots of photos (which can be annoying getting flashed in the eyes all meal long) or having people stand at the railing observing your meal or kids crawling on the fountain wall around you. To me, its a take it or leave it equation. I would aim for the patio just outside the restaurant where the negative aspects may be  minimized.   I've been here a couple times. Recently, they had a mozzarella, strawberry, basalmic salad that was great! I once had a great risotto, last visit was a combo of over/under cooked (like they had some left over from another table and mixed old w/ new). $40 for risotto with salmon bits, 5 small clams, and a fair portion of calamari is a little steep. Other dishes have been good, can't remember anything I wouldn't try again. Caprese is good. Wine markup is a little much for mostly entry level selections. Service was execellent.   I would go again and would recommend it to a friend. For that, I rounded them up from 3.5 stars to 4.",

I had two bites of the pasta and set it off to the side.   The bread you get with the oil was the best thing here.  We spent 60 bucks and it was not worth it at all!

The ceasar salad was drenched in dressing, maybe to hide the fact that the romaine was slightly wilted.  My chicken parm had no taste except for being burnt.  The accompanying pasta with marinara sauce tasted of licorice because someone used fennel in the sauce for some odd reason. My husband's carbonara had no taste also.  Not worth the money.",

We enjoyed pasta & salad - really tasty since made for the masses.  The wait staff was very attentive to our big group of 8 as we were fed quickly to make our show.  Very nice, I'd come back.",

There is a considerable amount of foot traffic near the dining patio, where people stop to take pictures of both the fountain and of people dining there. The seating is pretty crammed in the front of the restaurant. The heavy foot traffic, crammed seating, and fountain sounds combined make for a loud dining experience that makes it hard to hear your waiter and hard for your waiter to hear you.   Besides this, the food is to die for. Everyone in my party loved the dishes they ordered! My family has been to Italy and we believe this restaurant emulates the True Italian dining experience to a tee! So if you want to truly immerse yourself in the 'Caeser Palace mindset' - this would be a restaurant to look into!",

It was early and not super crowded so we were able to get a table near the fountain.  It's a little loud, with the water rushing down, but so fun.  The staff was awesome.  Several people asked how we were and if we needed anything.    They had lunch special running that consisted of choosing a soup/salad and entree for $20.  So hubby and I both had the Caesar salad and he ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese and I ordered the Chicken Parm.  Of course we shared the entrees.  Both were really good.  The chicken was breaded nicely and was really juicy.  I didn't care too much for the marinara that topped it, but it wasn't horrible, just a little thin.  The Bolognese was AWESOME.  The dish came with a meatball on the side that was pretty tasty.  It wasn't as good as Rao's, but definately worth trying.  The pappardelle pasta was cooked nicely and held the bolognese really well.    We will definately come back to Trevi when we visit Vegas....which is alot!  Cheers!",

    "text": "Overview: Trevi is an midrange Italian restaurant located inside Las Vegas's Cesar's Palace  shopping center immediately next to the transforming indoor fountain.  The Establishment: This is hands down why you should come here. Located immediately next to the beautiful transforming fountain in an pseudo-outdoor mall, it's one of the most relaxing places to be. Lighting is kept relatively dim and the atmosphere is definitely classy. While your fellow patrons may be dressed in Hawaiian shirts, plenty of others will be wearing their nice \"going out to a club later tonight\" outfits. Spacing is a little bit tight with small tables. Noise is average to slightly high.  The Food: I enjoyed their Cesar salad, Salmon, and chocolate gelato and thought that while it was all prepared very well, I did not feel that it was worth the price. $10 for a Cesar Salad appetizer without meat, $28 for the Salmon, and $6.5 for the chocolate gelato (as of April 2016) was simply too much when the Bellagio offers a \"Gourmet Dinner Buffet\" for $41 or regular dinner buffet for $36.  The Service: Service for at Trevi wasn't very quick and I feel like it's because it's hard to balance out the waitstaff with the intense variation in crowds that frequent Vegas. I see from reading other reviews that many other people have great service here and I guess it depends on waitstaff scheduling.   Conclusions: Great ambiance, great location, overpriced, slow service, not-exciting but good quality food.",

Seeing as we had a lot of time to kill while waiting for our Cirque Du Soleil, show we decided to come here for happy hour after much tought with the other HH spots.   What made this encounter less than perfect was the young hostess and one of the two bartenders that Friday afternoon who were in desperate need of joy.   That tidbit was over as soon as we got to the booze and food. We essentially had most of the lower carb $6 bites featured and they didn't disappoint. The flavorful Fried Calamari, Arancini and Homemade Meatballs certainly complemented the cocktails. The $7 Rye Lemonade and the $4 Classic Frozen Bellini were happy discoveries for this HH seeking couple.  I would recommended this place as a good happy hour spot for its value  and taste but some of the staff could use a smile (a fake one would do) plastered on their mugs.",

The lasagna was good. Taste was good, nice amount of cheese/sauce ratio. The salmon dish was okay. The spaghetti was alright. The pasta didn't have much flavor, and the meatballs were basic beef meatballs. The spedini was very different from spedini that one would normally be used to. Service was okay too, nothing to complain about there. Overall it was a nice atmosphere and we had a good time.",

We couldn't stop talking about how good the food was all weekend!   I had the Ravioli Alla Vodka. It was so creamy & delicious! Just the right amount of spicy to give the dish a nice warmth. The perfect amount of pasta was served as well.   The complimentary bread was so tasty. Warm, soft, and delicious.   We tried their Sangria and we were not disappointed. It was so well made, it tasted like juice.   The service was also great. Can't quite remember who served us but he was very nice & guided us to the dishes we would like.",

Our customer service was really fantastic however, the food was extremely mediocre. My friends all got pizza, and stated that it was extremely undercooked, and basically fell apart once they lifted it, and had way too many tomatoes. I will note that they all did finish their plates. I myself had the Gnocchi with marinara, it was  pretty bland in my opinion.  My husband and I also got two amaretto sours which were extremely thick. They had really great customer service and were really nice.. but for the price point me and my party were expecting a bit more of a kick from the food.",

For dessert I had the sorbetto icecream in lemon & raspberry, the raspberry was delicious but the lemon was way too tart!! The servers were really nice & helpful, although one of the guys totally asked me if I wanted cheese on my plate and somehow managed to get it down my dress and said, \"Oh it's okay you'll be alright.\" I wasn't upset about it, it's just cheese but his response could of had some form of an apology in it.",

The restaurant is located in the middle of Caesar's under the fake sky and by a beautiful fountain. It's also a great location to people watch as they walk around and shop at all the designer stores in the forum.  They had a two-course lunch special for $20 which is an amazing deal. The Sangria pitcher was $25 and so yummy that I can't wait to go back for more.  Ordered the Italian chop to split so one half was vegan while the other half was the regular version. Enjoyed the non vegan portion very much. We also split the eggplant Parmesan and my friend fully enjoyed hers but I felt the eggplant was too raw and not cooked enough so ended up just having a couple bites but eating the linguine that came with it. Another friend had the Trevi salad and spaghetti bolognese lunch special which was all polished off so must have been really good. The bread, oh the bread.... that's where I give all 5 stars as it is sooooo frigging yummy! It is definitely a weakness of mine.",

The restaurant is pretty half inside and half outside surrounding a fountain. We were sat next to the fountain. It was loud but fun to sit and people watch.  Service - our waitress was extremely friendly which was the only redeeming quality.   Food- I ordered eggplant Parmesan and my boyfriend got the chicken piccata. For the price I expected top of the line food or even above average. My eggplant was dried out and tasted old. There were numerous pieces on the plate but it tasted pre-made. It was actually difficult to cut through. Marinara was average. Pasta cooked properly. The chicken piccata medallions looked boiled or poached. There was no color on the chicken. Very unappetizing!  I tasted it and it had no lemon flavor. After a few bites I was tempted to say we aren't going to eat and we wanted our money back but I decided to just pick at it and leave. (Never go back).",

    "text": "Perhaps exceeding my expectations the most has to be Las Vegas' own, Trevi, in the Caesar's mall.  For some reason, Yelp's description of Trevi sounds more like an ice cream parlor; this is a SOLID ITALIAN RESTAURANT!  GO THERE NOW!!!!!!!  Not affiliated with any chain, I'm thinking this restaurant has been in the mall since the beginning.  And the only time I've ever eaten here was years ago, a forgettable pizza...cut to the moment.  A free night in Vegas, my friend said she wanted to eat, \"...a steak from an Italian restaurant\", a good idea I thought.  Now, I could have taken 2 weeks to find the perfect spot.  But instead, I booked a room close by and we walked to Trevi.  It was delicious! My steak was great and at $34.95, not overpriced for the on-the-Strip prices.  The risotto was good, not great.   Eddie, our waiter was friendly and not overbearing.  My friend did NOT get her steak from an Italian restaurant; she got seafood pasta, NO CHEESE!  God, it was better than my steak.  Seriously, if I lived near this place, I would have returned 3 times already, it's that good.",

I've also tried their polpetta di pollo (chicken meatball soup), and the fettuccine pollo carbonara. Their gelati is good, and also the \"Trevi\" bellini. No complaints. The staff is cordial and often funny. Sometimes it can get a bit loud depending on the day and if any people have wedding related parties, which are often held on the top floor. If you're going on the weekend, make a reservation just in case... you'll get right in. We've never had to wait longer than 4 minutes otherwise. Sign up for their card, it's definitely worth it.",

The restaurant itself was nice, a little pricey (but that's expected in Vegas). Most of the ambiance comes from the fountain and elements surrounding the outside of the venue. My suggestion is to sit on the outside whenever possible to get the full experience.   The only reason it's not a 5 is that the dinner was great, but somewhat forgettable. And of course, that's just a matter of opinion. But it's a safe selection if you want to dine out in Vegas and have a really nice meal that's worth the prices.",

We were seated right away, on the \"outside\" of the restaurant, right next to the fountain. It took the waiter about 10 minutes to finally come to the table and take our drink order.  Drinks arrived, we ordered our food. I split the cheese sticks (well they were actually shaped like a patty) with a friend. They were super yummy. For my main course, I ordered the chicken marsala. It was definitely worth the wait, one of the best orders of chicken marsala I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the sauce on the chicken was delicious.   This isn't a place to come if you are in a hurry. But it's a great place if you want some good Italian food and do some people watching with good company. The food is definitely worth it and at a reasonable price as well.",

They passed by us multiple times, making eye contact with us, but never actually helped us. Our drink order was not even taken.  After we finished eating and our plates were cleared, we waited another 15 minutes for our check, which in the end we did not even receive; our waiter came and just dropped off the dessert menu and barely asked us if we were considering dessert. By that point we wanted to just pay and leave.  For a well known and expensive Vegas restaurant I would expect much better service.

They had just sat down and we were mid way thru dinner. The server never came back. Then my son started having allergy issues to the dog (that end up triggering asthma attacks) and spoke to the hostess and host.

    "text": "While staying at Cesar's Palace my husband and I did some exploring through the Forum shops (fancy name for a mall) Due to his inordinate love of Italian food, eating at Trevi was inevitable so here's my review!  Service: Sunday night, had about a 10 minute wait for a beautiful table on the \"patio\" (will explain this in a bit) but we NEVER mind waiting at a nice bar. Everyone working this fine restaurant we encountered from the host, server and bar tender were superbly professional.  Drinks: My husband throughly enjoyed a ruby port and I had a fabulous gin drink. More than adequate wine selection which we each had a nice glass with dinner. Beautiful wine glasses topped off our experience only making it sweeter.  Atmosphere: Super chic, modern Italian sort of place without being stuffy. You feel fine here dressed up or in shorts but most folks around Cesar's dress it up a bit at night FYI. There is nothing overbearing or formal about Trevi so no worries.  Food: Cannot say just how much I enjoyed my marsala. Can NEVER get enough marsala and my husband a spicy penne dish - can't recall the name right off hand. What really makes these sort of dishes are the sauces and these were incredible, tasty, not too salty balace of savory with spice and Italian flare. Meals are served with warm fresh bread and a rosemary infused olive oil at the table so you don't have to wait for more to dredge your bread through.  \"Patio\" Now this is the crown jewel. Browse the pictures and you'll see the lion share of the seating is \"outdoors\" which is really indoors but with the water fountain, the painted ceilings and the highly decieving lighting you will be completely fooled into thinking you are outside without the wind, the heavy Las Vegas side walk traffic loaded with stumbling drunks, etc. The atmosphere out there is just so peaceful and pleasant. I don't have adequate words.  Overall HIGHLY recommend Trevi and I hope to be back next year!",

If you happen to be seated in the \"patio\" right next to the fountains (like us), expect to photobomb dozens of pictures throughout your meal.   Service was slow and bleh.. the waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there on a late Sunday morning.  Luckily, the food and good company made up for the grouchy server. I ordered a dish with a long Italian name and \"Shrimp\" thrown in somewhere. From my foggy recollection, there were 4 or 5 ginormous shrimps swimming in a sea of pasta shells (or rotini?) dressed in a rich, creamy, mouth-watering sauce.   I had only finished half my pasta when my entire party (sans me) had their empty plates cleared from the table. I wanted to be considerate with my friends' time, so I packed up my leftovers. Even though I brought food home, the portion size was definitely more European-like than American.   For the price I paid ($20+/entree), I expected more food. Even the bf was sulking about being hungry after he finished his lasagna.  Vegas prides itself in being excessive, and Trevi fell short of that standard. Sure, the food delivers and the restaurant is a cute date spot, but when I'm in Vegas, I'm going big or going home... or not coming back, but I would love to check out the Happy Hour here. I just doubt I'll be dining here again, with so many more awesome and cheaper choices on and around the Strip.",

We order the specials which has to be the best of the night. But surprisingly the specials were without any taste, cold and not worthy of 36.00 dollars charged, we all sent the food back to reheat and very unhappy with quality of the steak as well of the quantity of the dinner, even the waiter who by the way was a great guy and very accommodating didn't hide his disappointment from the food... we end up paying outrageous money for a bad and taste free food, nothing was Italian in that place that night. I will never go back.",

The pizza was not very good and is the primary motivator of the rating. The crust was neither crispy nor floppy, but was just kind of chewy and doughy in a way that didn't really fit the style. The tomatoes and basil weren't well-integrated into the pizza, either. The spaghetti ice, however, had good presentation and was tasty.",

    "text": "I attended a small event at the restaurant and it was held upstairs in their private dining room, which overlooks the rest of the restaurant.  The overall layout of the restaurant looks good - they have a pretty large \"patio,\" which is right by the fountain.  Inside is more tables and a large-ish bar with tvs.  The kitchen was open and you could see the action.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and we got to taste a few items from the menu.  The meatballs were very tasty, as was the pasta we had (I don't know which it was, and none on the menu look familiar).  We also had a really good chicken - it was the pollo la griglia.  I love anything with a white wine sauce and capers, so I was sold from the get go, but it was very flavorful and tender.  There were also stuffed mushrooms, which I don't see on the menu, so maybe it was made just for the event?  Either way, they were good.  Pretty standard.  Same goes for the bruschetta - it was good, not great.  But I am not complaining either.  For drinks they served a great pomegrante martini.  I am usually a beer drinker, but this was pretty good.  Super sweet and strong, so I had only 1.  The restaurant is easily accessible, since it is located not too far into the Forum Shops, near the fountain.  If you are local, I would suggest parking in the Colosseum garage or valet for easy access.  I would love to come back and try other items on the menu and actually it down for a full meal, rather than a buffett style private event.",

I had the chicken Marsala and my boyfriend had Bistecca Fiorentina. And we split the kalamari appetizer.

The manager came out and brought the bachelorette a drink on the house on arrival which was nice. They brought bread with oil and vinegar and put it in the center so only some of us could reach it because we had a big party but once we asked for another one they brought it. They also brought us butter which I did not try but some girls mentioned that it was ice cold. Then we had some shareable apps. I really liked the butternut squash ravioli. It was sweet and savory at the same time. We also ordered bruschetta which was different. It looks more like bread with 3 different dips. The mozzarella app was just ok as well. It came with marinara sauce on top which I liked but just tasted like mozzarella sticks. The highlight of my dish was the Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare. I wish I saved a pic so I could post it. I told them I was sharing with a friend and they were so nice to split it in the back because we were not exactly sitting next to each other. The half portion was perfect for me and they were not at all stingy with the seafood. This is one of their signature dishes and I would definitely recommend it. Service was on point. The server checked on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. He also then brought out a complimentary dessert for the bachelorette as well. It felt special like it was her birthday. This place is located inside the Caesars hotel and I would recommend coming back here if your visiting Vegas and looking for a good dinner sport.",

The best part of this restaurant was the happy hour! $4 and $5 drinks on special were perfect. The cheapest and most delicious drinks we had in Vegas. Yes dinner was pricey but the drink specials were excellent. The bartenders were very friendly and were checking on us often. For dinner and 5 rounds of drinks came to about $100 bucks. Like I said the dinner was pricey for the amount of food you get but it was really good.   Will def come back to eat here before a night on the town. Being able to start with 5 rounds of drinks here saved us big time before hitting Omnia as their drinks were $22 bucks a piece. Visit the Trevi, the food and staff were excellent!",

They had a great lunch deal for a $10 daily large pizza of the day along with a $10 pasta of the day. We opted for both along with calamari and peach bellinis.

Mozzarella Fritta:this was alright, nothing great really. Traditional Caesar Salad: It was very flavorful and delightful. Fettuccine Al Pesto Con Gamberi: so delicous, I'd get this dish again. Shrimp Americinan: Everyone loved this plate.  It was a hit. Penne Diavolo: Also very good.  All these dishes fed 6 ladies and we were all stuffed to the max.  We shared family style.

Tables are packed tight too.  Only bottled beer no draft.  $7 for a blue moon is a rip off.  I didn't pay that in Rome in front of the real Trevi fountain!!!  The calamari was ok.  Brushetta was lacking in taste, dont waste your money on it.  The pizza's looked good but for $17 they should.  Tourist trap for sure!",

Perfect for people watching, while they shop.. or you can sit inside in a dimly lit romantic restaurant.    How we came here?  After a long drive to Vegas and meeting up some friends at Max Brenner's place... we were so hungry that we just picked any place that looked somewhat affordable to eat in the Forum Shops.    Luckily it was a winner.  I felt bad because I think I was probably staring down at the hostess, but she seated up quickly inside and we were happy.   We ordered, our food came out quick and we left.    We ordered a salad, an appetizer and a pizza.  The Trevi Salad, this fried seafood mix and a Margherita pizza. The hit of the meal? The salad.    Thank you for a quick and affordable meal.  Looking for a quick bite at the Forum Shops? Come here.  Looking for memorable food, probably not.",

He made excellent recommendations based on our dietary concerns.  The food was good - I had the rigatoni bolognese which good. Flavourful sauce, hearty. My husband had capellini al pomodoro which was refreshing and light. Both of us really enjoyed our bruschetta to start with as well.",

We got to dine right next to the posidon fountain :)  we were a large group so I got to sample a lot of their food. I'll start with the grilled salmon with risotto. The risotto was really good,  creamy but not bland. The salmon was yummy too, slightly over cooked. We also had the lasagna pizza which was excellent. The margarita pizza was pretty average but I guess you can't do much with that so won't complain. We also ordered a fettuccine chicken white sauce pasta which was amazing. Overall had a wonderful experience. The service was upto the mark too :)",

    "text": "We were at Caesars Forum shops because we had to buy a gift and of course we got hungry along the way.  We were in the mood for some Italian so it was either Spagos or Trevi.  We walked past spagos and didn't feel like mingling with a bunch of senior citizens so we decided to roll with Trevi.  Took about 20 minutes to get us seated.  Tip...you want to be around in case they call your name before your approximate time.  They move through the list pretty quickly.  Two calls then onto the next.  We like to order something very basic when we go to a new restaurant.  If they cannot get the basic menu items down, we really don't have an interest in returning.  So we ordered the Calamari for app.  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and my wife ordered the chopped Italian Salad.  The calamari was a little on the bready side and the sauce was ok.  Nothing extraordinary.  The spaghetti was ok as well.  I can't say it tasted horrible.  But there's nothing really special about it.  My wife liked her chopped salad.  At the end of the day, we spent approx $70 for food that is worth about $30. So the food is 3 star worthy, but the price knocked it down a star. I guess they have to find a way to pay the lease at Caesars!",

Although some of my colleagues dishes looked more adventurous, I was really in the mood for a salad and this one was fantastic. It was filling and full of protein with a delicious dressing.

We've been fortunate to have an excellent server on both occasions.  This time around Alexis was a blast.  She was fun to talk to and very attentive.  It's always nice when you get to know your server a little bit and she was very open to conversation and telling us a little bit about herself.  We always like to split our entree and Trevi is very good about that.  On both occasions they've always split our order and/or brought out an extra plate without us even asking for it.",

    "text": "Very, very solid choice for a meal/cocktails/snacks. My husband and I had just arrived in town and found ourselves at Caesars Palace /Casino. We were starving but everything inside the casino was very high end. We ventured inside the Forum Shops area and stumbled upon this restaurant . The menu looked good and prices were moderate so we decided to give them a try.  We were very happy with our meal. First of all, do yourself a favor and make sure you're seated on the patio (still indoors but you get the same feel) which overlooks the Fountain of the Gods and also makes for wonderful people watching!   The menu is rather large and lengthy with many Italian favorites. As always, we were famished and wanted to order everything. Thankfully, our server warned us that portions were large and suggested against ordering an appetizer since so I was ordering a frozen Bellini, a salad and each of us was ordering a full sized entree.   So glad we listened to her because out came a basket of the most delicious bread and olive oil. Mmmmm don't skip that!  The Caesar salad was good but way too much dressing was tossed with. I will skip it or share. I ordered the Gnocchi Modenese. While it was rich and delicious- after a few bites, I understood why our server warned us of portions. The gnocchi pieces were like butter (well ricotta and potato) and my stomach let me know so couldn't handle any more bites as it was closed for business lol! My husband had the Ravioli Alla Vodka- cheese filled ravioli with vodka tomato cream sauce. Again- delicious but way too filling. We honestly should've ordered 1 salad and an entree to share but hindsight is 20/20! Lol   Anyways- location is perfect, service was great, food was delicious and a wonderful value for the money . I would suggest ordering too little rather than too much. You can always add on!",

I grab a chair from an empty table because it was an empty restaurant and it shouldn't matter.   This bitter bit** comes over rips the chair from my purse and laughs and says \"oops sorry guess we need the chair \" in the MOST condescending tone ever with the stupidest fakest giggle ever.

Which is pretty much a frozen peach alcohol drink. It was good but too sweet for my taste. So if you like frozen sweet drinks this is for you! The appetizer was the Fried Calamari. Let me say I have tried a lot of calamari but this by far is my favorite. It was light but tasty with the black pepper aioli sauce to go with it. Well that sauce alone I loved!   The bartender Ryan was sweet and was very helpful. Told me about happy hour which was the best thing ever because my bill was only $10!! So thank you for recommending that:)  All in All loved my experience when I was looking for a quick bite!",

We shared a Trevi salad and a pizza, which we have always done.  We were expecting a beautiful green salad, however the salad was almost white...it reminded us of bagged iceberg salad that has been in the bag a day or two too long. It was in small pieces.  Yuck!  The pizza was cold.  We did not have gelato, but they were serving a lot of it.  We wondered if folks would have changed their minds if they knew the gal dipping it out of the containers was blowing her nose in kleenexes, throwing them away bare handed, then grabbing the dishes, not by the stem, but with fingers inside the rim, as she got them out of the cupboard.  Sneezing, wiping her nose with the palm of her hand, licking fingers, and continuing to serve without washing her hands in between were observed multiple times.  Not to mention another employee eating out of one of a container behind the counter.  Normally we would have contacted a manager, however, we were in a hurry to get to the concert.  By the way, we did not have a problem with the service.  We won't be going back.",

I personally think Italian food is somewhat predictable, but that is a good thing sometimes.    I wasn't too hungry.  [ Okay fine, I didn't want to each too much cause we were planning on hitting the clubs after. ]  So I ordered the Calamari Fritti appetizer.  It was delicious and more than enough food for an entree, but I suppose it's meant to be shared.  Anyway, it was fried calamari which was done perfectly, not overcooked and chewy.  It also included lightly fried veggies all dressed with a Lemon sauce.  The Grey Goose dirty martini with three olives I ordered was also made perfectly.  Strong and salty, just how I like it!  The waiter was extremely nice and friendly.  Minus 1 Star for the somewhat crowded seating arrangement.  There was a private party occupying the entire upper floor, so this may be the explanation.  Overall a good experience.",

The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend, the specials a little more glamorous, and the alcohol a little tastier.   We went two nights in a row, and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers. The pizza I ordered was good but not great, but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding. The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil, and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with. The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix... Seriously, fungi? Never have I had that in bruschetta before. Whatev.   Last night, the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries, and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them, he comped them, but brought them out as a bonus. See? Wasn't that nice? In Vegas, everyone's a winner!",

    "text": "We had my friend's bachelorette dinner here on Oct. 1st. None of us has ever been here. The bride picked it when we were strolling along in the Forum Shops.  We had a party of 10 and they sat us right next to the wall of wine which was cool with us cause it was in the cut and we knew we were going to be loud.  I ordered the stuffed eggplant. I forgot what it was called on the menu but hot damn...it was GOOD! My friend got the tuna salad. It was ok. We both concluded that it would have been tastier with albacore tuna. The tuna they used was like chicken of the sea tuna or something. It was bland. They had specialty drinks and so I ordered the bride a citrus type mix martini. Again, I forgot what it was called on the menu. Well it wasn't on the menu, It was on one of those ads placed on tables. The bride loved it! She said that it tasted really good and even asked if there was alcohol in it. Then by the end of the night, she told me that the drink was kicking in. It was creeper!!! Haha. That was great!  Out waitress brought out a complimentary bowl of gelato for the bride but it was so huge, that we all had dibs on it.  Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and the waitress was great! The company was even better. =)",

    "text": "That's my first \"one star\" review...  But boy, do I think that this place deserves it!    Anyway, me and my friends (a total of 5), ended up here after we were told that we would have to wait for 90 minutes or so at the close by Cheesecake Factory.  The ambiance is quite nice, with the fountain, and the surrounding expensive jewelry shops, but ten minutes or so down the road things get quite uncomfortable, since three disadvantages of the fountain become quite prominent:  a)that thing is loud, b)it gets quite chilly, and last but not least, c)you get an idea of how being a movie star is, being on the spot of a couple hundreds of photographs and flashes every minute, from all the tourists that are trying to keep the fountain in the Las Vegas memories...  (and all this while you are trying to eat).  The service:  bad and borderline rude.  I never thought that a server would actually be rude, or indifferent let's say, to his customers, but this guy certainly was that.  As far as time handling though is concerned, it was ok.  Not the best I have had, not the worst either, to be fair.  The food:  Bad and overpriced.  I got the chicken parmesan.  I ate it.  Nothing more to say, it was just a plain plate, a plain taste, just plain...  But, I guess I was the lucky one, because nobody else in my group neither enjoyed, nor ate what they got.  Unfortunately I do not remember what the others got, but it wasn't good.  (one of them I think got the spinach pizza, and I just remembered that because I remembered that he had to perform a surgery on it, taking almost all the toppings off, in an effort to get it closer to being edible.  In a nutshell:  as somebody else said, a tourist trap.  I was a tourist, and I got trapped.... but I am never going back.",

    "text": "Been here once for dinner.  Would recommend more for their creme brulee, but not so much for their food.  Good for a dessert, hanging out and people watching.  Good location if you stay in Caesar Palace.  My husband & I went here last week before we left for Vegas. Judging purely by the menu price (entree in the $25-35 range) and its Yelp rating, we were looking for a pleasant experience but we were both disappointed.  Have to say that their service is great though, nice casual atmosphere, but the problem lies solely in the food.  It was Monday nite at 7pm, the place was not fully  packed until we left at 9pm.  We were greeted by some pretty hostesses who quickly seated us at a comfortable table inside the restaurant.  Their menu is of reasonable size for an Italian fine dining restaurant.    Our waitress was a young polite cheerful lady who promptly served us with some warm rosemary infused French bread to go with the olive oil, which turned out to be a pretty good combination.  We ordered a pizza ($18) and their Signature grilled fish of the day ($32), which was salmon.  For some reasons, the pizza came out way before the salmon.  The pizza was just so so but certainly not the worst we had so far . The crust was Italian-style thin but it seriously lacked the crispness and texture you would expect if it was served right out of the oven.  We assumed someone might have let it sit in the attempt to wait for the salmon to come out together.  Flavor-wise, ingredients (mushroom, red & green pepper, Italian sausage & something else that I don't remember) were fresh but the tomato sauce lacked flavor.  The waitress apologized for the delay when the salmon came out after our pizza was almost done.  However it was not worth the wait; there was little or no presentation to the dish (the plate had the fish, some capers, sauteed asparagus and 2 apparently 2 day-old potato cakes.  There was no sauce, no art, no special arrangement).  The salmon was totally dry, overcooked when flaked.  The only flavor it had was barely provided by a few capers sprinkled on top of the fish.  Other than that the fish has no flavor.  Immediately we returned the dish to the kitchen. The manager and the waitress politely apologized and agreed that it was apparently overcooked.  We patiently waited for another 10mins or so until the manager brought us another fish but this time it was undercooked a bit.  It flaked with a fork on the outside but not on the inside as it was still a bit translucent raw.  We showed it to the manager, and this time he watched over the chef's shoulder to make sure the fish had been properly seared and done.  Third time is the charm, the salmon came out cooked and moist, but again, it was not seasoned and had no particular flavor.  O well, by this time, my husband had long finished his pizza so I shut up and quickly finished it.    Just as we were about to ask for the bill, the waitress apologized once again for the fish and was nice enough to offer give us complimentary dessert.  So we chose a creme brulee to share, not dare to expect anything special.  We were glad to give it a shot as the brulee was one of the better quality one out there.  The sugar crust was torched just right. Creme was not too sweet, had a good smooth creamy texture, right consistency, and the right balance between the vanilla and egg flavor.",

    "text": "I made reference to 'crap at Caesar's Palace' in my review of the delightful Thai Room.  This is an explanation of that reference.  Our waiter was atrocious, a real slime. My wife ordered a Margarita, traditional. She choked down half of it. It was disgusting. I had a Coconut Mojito, thought I'd try something different. It wasn't. Boring. My pepperoni pizza was boring, but edible-ish. My wife's Margherita was a revolting mess. This is the definition of simple and they managed to screw it up. I think it starts with using crap ingredients. Normally it's done with fresh Mozzarella. This must have come out of a bag from COSTCO. That would have been OK if the waiter had bothered to do that, \"How is everything?\" trip back to the table after the food has been on the table for just long enough for the customer to have assessed the fare. (They take it in service training right before the course entitled \"Improving your tip percentages - Attention to the customer\") Not here! I ate mine, went to the john (number 1 and number 2, not just a simple drain and shake), washed my hands, returned to the table, cleared my email, waited 10 more minutes and finally our waiter decided it was time to pay a visit. Smooth. \"How is everything?\" How does it look you dumb ass? Mine's eaten, my wife's has had one bite taken out of it and returned to the plate. Take a freaking guess  \"How it is\"! Duh!  It took us 30 mins to get the check. With the Manager's swift intervention. Did I mention, at the end, the offered to bring her something else? Are they kidding? Short of Roses, Krystal and a Chanel gift card, these guys would be better off just hiding in the back.  There are better culinary offerings in Las Vegas, even in Caesar's  - just try Fat Tuesday's, better food, better value and they give a damn. Ticket: Table 22/1 Guests:2, 09/02/12 3:09 pm, #60028, Server J***n, Cashier N***l. Thanks guys, the wife was already pissed off, you just sent her over the moon.",

I'm a fan of the fruity drinks but my husband who's more a hard liquor man said it was good too. The fried calamari is a must for an appetizer. We enjoyed our food immensely but our waittress must have been coming down with a cold because as she was reciting the specials of the day, she was sniffling and I could see her nose start to run. She had to sniff it up before it nearly dripped out in front of us! Also, it was so obvious that she was trying to push the most expensive items on the menu on us. My husband clearly said he wanted something with chicken but she proceeded to try to sell him on some sort of medley of seafood and pasta.",

    "text": "I love this place!  Positioned by a mock-up of the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome in the middle of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops Promenade, Trevi is an excellent place to enjoy a casual lunch or dinner in a relaxed atmosphere with the interesting feeling that you're sitting outside, (when you're actually inside). Try to position yourself at least 30 feet from the large fountain if you want to hear each other speak. The decibel level of the fountain's spewing waters will rival any meaningful conversation you might want to have.  The Fettuccine Alfredo that I ordered at $18.00 was undoubtedly the best I ever tasted. The Alfredo sauce was creamy with a beautiful hint of parmigiana, and the fettuccine pasta was perfectly aldente. --A True masterpiece.  My friend's seafood risotto, at $29.95, was also prepared exceptionally well.  The entrees were preceded by a well prepared Caesar Salad, as well as an artichoke dip, at $14.00, that was quite tasty,but needed  a few more crostini (croutons) for dipping.   Dinner was enjoyed with several glasses of a nice buttery Chardonnay and capped off by a shared slice of strawberry, cheesecake at $8.00, which was also very tasty.   I recommend Trevi to everyone. It has such a relaxed old-world charm and atmosphere, and is also a perfect place to people-watch.  --One of my all-time favorites!",

For dinner, I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs (a rare choice for me) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. The spaghetti, was reminiscent of my younger days of Chef Boyardee. Honestly, not worth $18. The Chicken Marsala kind of reminded me of salisbury steak based on presentation. The chicken cutlets were cut thin and tasteless. The bread and oil dip was really good and had great flavor. Overall, the location was perfect for someone looking for a reasonably priced meal with the forum shops. The food is ok, but nothing to brag about. The food presentation is boring, and I considered the food to be just sustenance for a hungry person.

The lasagna is so rich and creamy, not like the usual dish that's drowning in a tangy tomato sauce.  The cheese in this dish was incredible.  It wasn't oozing out from the layers of pasta, but it simply melted in your mouth.  How did they do that?  Another favorite is the Romano Chicken over a bed of spinach.  Tender chicken crusted with cheesy breadcrumbs and a mushroom cream sauce.  Yeah baby.  And the good thing is, you're in the mall, so you can walk off the calories afterwards.  The restaurant has since changed the name to Trevi, but in talking to the staff, it's the same restaurant.  Same location in the Forum, same menu.",

    "text": "Terrible. Would not go again. Although the staff was attentive and kind, the food itself was not worth the visit. I ordered the cannelloni, took a bite and lost my appetite. It's filled with ground chicken, which on a personal note is gross. (If you like ground chicken, maybe you'll enjoy it.) Funny - my table said it was the better dish of the other two bad dishes we ordered. Two others ordered the Chicken Parmesan, but were not fans of that either; the red sauce had a sour taste to it and the chicken was dry. Lastly, my friend ordered the cheese ravioli's and said it was just okay. We all agreed that everything tasted as if it had been pre-cooked hours before and reheated in a microwave. We are not \"foodies\" or picky eaters; however, we expect food from a restaurant to be tasty and fulfilling. Bottom line, if you're thinking to get a quick bite to eat, I highly recommend going anywhere else but Trevi - even the food court at Caesar's had tastier items.",

Like maybe he'd gone out partying the night before and was still recovering. First thing, he messed up our order. When the wrong appetizers arrived at our table (45 mins after sitting down) he was just bringing us our drinks. STRIKE ONE!  About 30 mins later our food was brought out along with another tables plates. I watched as the food server left our food on a stand in the middle of the aisle as patrons walked by and inspected my food, while he served the other tables. NOT COOL! When he finally came back to serve our table, my lasagna was cold. I'm talking cheese not melted, hardened noodles -COLD. STRIKE TWO   After getting my food reheated, I was too through. The lasagna tasted terrible. Very bland and nothing like I'd hoped for. I didn't eat more than three bites of my entree. And though my husbands food was warm, it didn't taste all that great either. STRIKE THREE! At this point we just asked for the check and left.  Though the atmosphere is nice, but EXTREMELY LOUD if you sit out by the fountain, this place was sooooo not worth cost of admission. Spend a few extra bucks and just go to Spago!!!",

The waiters were understaffed, did not bring us our drinks or silverware promptly, and simply forgot about things we asked for. The starting salad looked like chopped lettuce from a bag thrown onto a plate. The entree I ordered was a steak fiorentina, medium rare. It was served to me pretty much medium well, with the heavy pesto sauce on top of the pre-sliced steak instead of under it, making the presentation fairly lackluster. Finally, the cheesecake dessert was a teeny tiny portion but was probably the best part of the meal in terms of taste. I hope the food is better if you order from the regular menu and the service is better if you go with a smaller group. Would not recommend having a large party here.",

I was not offered anything it's place...the waiter never even asked us if we wanted Dessert and did not even offer Dessert given the horrible dinner. I left trevi restaurant hungry. I am not sure if this is a management issue and the restaurant is starting to go down hill.

To start the table had an amazing view of the mall and fountains and made for some great pictures with my friends from out of town.  Also the energy was very alive and made for exciting dining experience being in the middle of everything. Our server was literally the best I have ever had. I really can see how he gets such a great section on such a busy night. He really allowed our party to have the amazing dining experience that we were looking for. He was sincerely nice in the most genuine way you could tell he really wanted us to have the best experience ever and we did. I will say its the best experience I have ever had dining out. It was the first time I have tried Trevi but it will certainly be a reason I go out to the strip. I plan out taking all my friends when they visit because i know there is nothing like it back where they live. The manager at the door was also very nice and they made sure our water's at no point were less than half full. The beverage i had i was a lemonade thing with alcohol that was on the seasonal menu and it was   one of the better drinks I have had. All the food i tried was amazing I'm pretty sure Trevi hold's itself to the highest standards.",

Btw, the olive oil for dipping is beyond low grade.....it is clear, not even a tinge of green.

Chicken sliders were also satisfying; like the sundried tomatoes, just not too impressed either. Meatballs and flash-fried calamari were definitely the most satisfying offerings. Highlight of the meal had to have been the martini's which were stiff and well flavored. The gentleman at the bar next to us ordered a pizza, and based on the smell and appearance wish we ordered that instead.

I have enjoyed this restaurant twice, once solo while I was waiting for a meet up, and the second time this weekend with my husband. The food has been great both times (pizza and wine the first time, and this weekend we made up a lite dinner of appetizers and wine). The staff is attentive and the view of the fountain and plaza is fun and entertaining. Only reason it isn't a 5 star rating is only due to the noise level of the outdoor dining (unavoidable) and the host had an opportunity to give us better seats near the fountain and chose not to. Otherwise- great food and service and excellent choice for dining in Caesars Palace!",

My girlfriends and I had stopped in here for a quick drink and a small snack.  We sat at the bar where there was a happy hour special, with mini sliders and drink specials - all of which were lovely.  The service up to this point was pretty good, and we had great time chatting and noshing and drinking.  The bill came (it was $60 something) and the four of us each threw down a $20 and a few bucks so there was close to $90 to cover our bill plus tip.  We proceeded to walk away and as we were trying to decide which direction we should go, the server comes running after us telling us that we were trying to stiff him!  Huh?  I thought maybe we miscalcuated the tip - so I reached for my wallet, when he tells us that we only put down $40...not $90 that I *KNEW* we put down.  After an *intense* discussion, the moment where one of my friends started to demand a manager, the server tells us to wait where we were, so that he could check to make sure that nothing was left under a napkin or something.  Magically, he checked with the busboy and the busboy \"accidentally threw away\" the rest of the money.  Um, I call BULLSHIT.    We should have stuck around and demanded to speak to a manager anyways - but we were on a short timeline to get a lot of shopping done so we left...but I seriously regret not calling a manager over, because seriously, that is some shady shenanigans!!!!!!!",

He said, sorry. Save your money go somewhere else.",

The chicken roasted was dry.   The carbonara that was so garlicky that you cheered garlic.  Horrible.  Been here twice.  Atmosphere is great. Wait staff very good.   Another note - the busboy was literally running in the restaurant.  Running.   Head chef (guy with beard) just sitting here watching and not saying anything.   Rule #1.  Don't run in a restaurant.   The staff however both times have been great here.  Carlos is an excellent waiter.   They just need to fix the food.  Just have someone independent review what's going on. You shouldn't have dry food and you shouldn't chew garlic in your carbonara.   The bread was OK but could be redone to be more Italian as well.  Personally I wouldn't go back.",

We started with calamari, it was ok, nothing special. We did appreciate that it was not overcooked as is usually the case with fried calamari. My friend had the grilled salmon salad which she loved. I opted for wide pasta with meat sauce and large meatball which was ok, sauce was a little sweet for my taste and the meatball kind of bland.   What we REALLY loved was the $25 carafe of Sangria. The carafe was filled to the top with sangria and very little ice. It is a great value and was actually pretty darn good sangria.",

We got lucky, because we didn't realize that there was a happy hour at 9 pm so we decided to take advantage of it and sat in the bar area. The restaurant ambience is really nice. The restaurant has \"outdoor\" seating in the shopping area at Caesars with a nice view, as well as indoor seatings.   We ordered their fried calamari and their sliders for appetizers on the happy hour menu, and we ordered the seafood pasta from their regular menu. Our server/bartender, Kevin, was extremely nice and even asked us if we wanted our pasta split in half for us. The appetizers came out first and were very good. The sliders were perfectly cooked and not dry, while the calamari was crisp and a good portion as well. The pasta also was a really good portion. It filled both of us up even if it was split in half for us, and they definitely didn't skimp out on the seafood.  Overall, it was an awesome first time experience. I'd highly recommend going at happy hour! Even if we got food from the happy hour menu, their regular menu, and drinks, the bill was definitely way under what we expected. Great customer service, good food and drinks for a good price. Definitely going to come back to try more of their menu.",

Took a table in the patio courtyard area under the faux sky and clouds. Mock statues and structures of Italy surround the dining area. The skyline rotates from daylight to twilight occasionally. Tourists walk by while shopping at the Forum Shops.  It's pure Vegas cheeze.   As for the food it's standard tourist style Italian fare. Fried Calimari was over-breaded. Linguini with bolognese sauce was just ok. The Grilled Chicken topped with lemon sauce with roasted veggies was pretty good, plus they do give you a hearty serving. Our waitress was terrific, super attentive, and helpful.  The saving grace were the delicious desserts. The gelatos and sorbets are outstanding. I had the Tiramisu Gelato and could have eaten a gallon of it! Wow.  As far as Italian food goes it was average, and there are many places in Vegas to get better. You go here for the fun cheezy Vegas ambiance after all.",

They seem more focused on the Happy Hour crowd seated outside. Took forever for our waiter to take our order and he wasn't friendly. From 5:30 until 6:30 pm all I saw was staff running and rushing all over the place in a hurry. Not a good dining atmosphere.  Our food was heavily salted. Swore my blood pressure went up 20 points from the sodium. My tomato basil soup was so salty I couldn't finish and Hubby agreed. His minestrone was better. entrees were not better. He thought his short rib was salty and the horseradish sauce was odd. The gnocchi was grainy tasting.  Our waiter did offer to re cook it but we were heading to the show.  My clams and linguini had chopped clams with clams in a shell. Potion size was good. But I've had this dish better at a smaller Italian restaurant in the Venetian.   The busboy didn't bring our focaccia bread until well after our soups arrived and the waiter who delivered our soups placed my bowl to the right of me not in front because my bread plate was still in front of me waiting for the bread.  Poorly trained staff. Should've placed the soup down and move the bread plate.  I ended up moving the soup bowl myself.   The lady at the table next to us complained about something and the mgr had to come over and ended up comping them for something.  Not coming back here.  Salt doesn't make a dish better. It ruins the dish.",

As far as food goes, they're pasta de mare was very good. It had scallops, lobster, shrimp and mussels. The sauce had to be my favorite part, however I would've liked some bread to go with it.    I had a few of their appetizers as well. Their stuffed mushrooms had very good flavor but they were too small. I had one of their beef sliders and it was good enough to keep me from buying a burger later.   Overall I would check this place out if you're in the mood for a good Bellini, great atmosphere and friendly wait staff.",

The food was very disappointing  we decided to do the price fix menu they offer with show tickets  I was sceptical but since I had eaten there before I felt it was a good deal.  Not at all.  First I had the ceasers salad  my better half had the trevi.  The dressing was tasty but my salad was just drenched and soggy.  His salad was just OK.  Then the pasta came I ordered the chicken carbanara and he ordered the marinara with meatball  they were both so tasteless .  A carbanara should be rich and creamy and you normally take half home  it literally tasted like someone just poured cream over fettuccine.  No thickness or garlic  I literally left half for them to throw out.  The marinara tasted like cheap jar sauce and they only gave him one meatball versus the two you see in the pictures and it tasted more like breadcrumbs.  We took our dessert to go as we were headed for our show.  Incredibly disappointed.  If you are going to offer a price fix menu make sure the quality equals your standard. Next time I am in Vegas I will most likely not come back here",

Our waiter was pleasant, knowledgeable and even cracked a few jokes and gave us great service throughout the duration of our meal. I ordered a salad and a margherita pizza and my bf ordered a chicken pasta dish.   You could tell that Trevi put love in preparing their food. I can't necessarily say if it was authentic or not, but it tasted darn good to me. The pasta was fresh and light and seasoned well and my pizza was seasoned and I could really taste the basil. The crust was thin and crispy and I could taste a hint of butter.   My Italian soda wasn't overly sweet and our lemon and strawberry sorbet was delicious! The lemon was tart and you could tell it was made from real lemon. It was overpriced of course, but hey it's Vegas and we were dining in the middle of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops outside a beautiful fountain. I would like to go back on my next visit and try a few more menu items.",

    "text": "Nestled right next to the giant Caesar's Palace fountain in the Forum Shops the food is just alright but the location is dead center. The one nuance is that a lot of tourists like taking pictures of this massive fountain so if you get the table in front, be sure to be photo bombing a ton of random people's photos. That being said, the food is okay and the price variability is really bizarre. The margherita pizza special was 10 bucks and was rather tasty and then the 28 dollar amatriciana shrimp pasta was very mediocre. Especially if you are in Vegas and especially in Caesar's there are plenty of better eats for the same price!",

SUSAN our waitress was very attentive deserves 5*s and a pay raise. 2*s is for the overall review. 1* for the ambiance / location and 1* for our waitress. FOOD gets ZERO stars! Our table ordered ... CALAMARI FRITTI - worst we have ever tried (batter was so thick you couldn't taste the calamari) LINGUINE AI FRUTTI DI MARE - Everything was ok EXCEPT the shrimp (shrimp tasted like the precooked, flash frozen shrimp and reheated...gross) RIGATONI SALSICCIA - Rigatoni with italian sausage, UNDERCOOKED pasta... was hard... could of even had better from premade pastas from Olive Garden. LASAGNA PIZZA - So so, filling but regular pizza looks way better (table next to us had a pepperoni and confirmed it was excellent) Last was another pasta dish that my cousin ordered and she mentioned was only ok.  Will NOT return, so many better choices available in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ok this very easy to give this place a 5 star. I actually asked a friendly looking man standing in front of the restaurant if he would take a picture of me and my wife in front of the beautiful fountain. He took a picture and then tried to hand me a menu and invited me in for happy hour. I felt a lil obligated after he took a picture to at least take a glance. To my surprise the prices were very affordable. The happy hour menu had 6 dollar apps and drinks for 7 dollars. I was shocked because i had looked at menus at the other two restaurants right next door and i was figuring that Trevi would be more expensive considering it was the nicest looking restaurant. We decided we could go in for a drink. I asked for a patio table so we could people watch. The place was packed but we got a table right away. You could sense that everyone around looked happy so i was really feeling the place. My server came to the table and greeted himself almost as soon as we sat down. His name was Rufus and he was the most fun waiter I've ever had. He was making us laugh the whole time he took care of us. I ordered a Peroni and my wife got the pomegranate cosmo. You cant really mess up a beer but my wife loved her drink. We were not planning on eating because it was so late but im soooooooo glad we did. My wife an i split the house dish the linguine el fruite de mare. Rufus had the kitchen split it in the back for us and they didnt charge us for it. It was the best seafood pasta ive ever had. The seafood was fresh and you could tell It was the homemade seafood cream sauce that made the dish because the ingredients were very simple. I damn near licked my bowl but i didnt want to be that guy. We just hung out and watched all all the random people walking around. It was a great time. My check came out to just over 45 dollars and it was worth every cent. I felt like i cheated them. I had more then just a meal, i felt like a had a True dining experience and at a very affordable cost and thats why im giving trevi a 5 star. Next time i am in the forum shops i know exactly where ill be going. I want to go back with an empty stomach and the intent to sit down and eat because remember we only came in for a drink but we were enjoying ourselves so we just kind of went with it and took Rufus's suggestion and got the house dish. Put it this way, this place is sooooo good i mad a conscious effort to tell everyone about it. Thank you Rufus!",

My first choice for that evening was Carmine Italian restaurant within the forum shops but the host guy told us in a very rude way that they were all booked for that evening, it was 3:15 pm when we stopped by, 90 percent of their restaurant was empty. At 6 pm, when we finished dinner at Trevi, we walked by Carmine on the way out, yes they were busy but I can still see at least 7-8 tables empty.",

By the time you finished your iced tea, he put's down another one, what a service or either that he can tell we're dehydrated from consuming so much alcohol in our weekend stay.   We ordered cream of mushroom (yummy), calamari (ok), crab spinach & artichoke dip (yummy), salad (gigantic) and 3 of us ordered linguini di mare (huge proportion but bland in taste). Pricey lunch but hey you're in Vegas.   After our lunch, we were so ready to be back home, away from cigarettes & cigar smokes.",

My husband had the Trevi salad - it was spectacular.  The vinaigrette had the right amount of tang and the salad was fresh and tasty.  For the entrees, I had the lasagna which was huge, mouth-watering, and rich, and my other half had the spaghetti and meatballs - he exclaimed it was the best he had ever had.  The pasta was cooked to perfection - there's a fine line with al dente and they nailed it.  The tomato sauce was rich and could have stood on it's own sans meatballs, although all these combined took it over the top.  For dessert we shared the chocolate \"gooey\" cake with vanilla gelato on top - a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Must also mention their latte and cappuccino - again, equally fabulous.  Ask for Nick - his service was spot on.   A place like Trevi proves that Las Vegas is becoming the culinary capitol of the US.",

My BFF and I shared a Ceasar Salad, a Chicken Ceasar Salad Wrap with french fries, and a  Margherita Pizza.

So based on some reviews and a friend's recommendation we went.  I think the lasagna my wife had was ok, but the crispy skin Salmon that our friend ordered (to make sure it was done completely) was not done completely.  And my Linguine al Frutti di mare (seafood linguine) was bland!!  Ok, so we're not exactly near the ocean, but this is Vegas.  EVERYTHING can be gotten here!  I didn't taste anything except cream.  Shrimp, scallops, and even the mussels were flavorless.  Add some garlic!  Add some salt and pepper!  Something!!!  The best part of the meal was really excellent bread (the only reason I didn't give them only 1 star!)......oh, and don't try to go here before seeing a show at the Bellagio!

It was such a nice view and felt like it was real. Our server was nice and friendly and took our order right away.  We got the Italian sausage pizza and fettuccini pollo carbonara. We also got some wine and cocktails while waiting for our meals to get served. Food was just ok for me. It wasn't bad but nothing extraordinary. Our drinks was pretty standard. Price was reasonable if you're in Vegas of course.  One tiny thing, drinks were priced around $10-$15 but if you get a double shot, price is also double! My friend paid $30 for a glass of double long island iced tea! We later found out that pricing was the same at most restaurants and bars. I guess that's the downside of being in a hot tourist spot. Good thing I'm not a big drinker!  Oh well, we had a great dinner nonetheless.",

I especially like the fried mozzarella appetizer and the trevi salad. Their pizza is authentic think Italian style pizza and it's delicious. The desserts are also amazing, especially their gelato and sorbet.  The service here is impeccable. All the employees are so nice and helpful and they all really strive for the guests to have the best experience possible. On my most recent visit, my server Gaetano was amazing and truly made it one of my best experiences here yet. He got all my food perfect(I sometimes have difficult orders) and always made sure everything was too my liking.  I always make sure to make a trip to trevi when I'm in Vegas and you should too!",

We were booked at Joe's Seafood at the same mall, but they could not accommodate our party since more people were added, so I had to change restaurants.  Trevi did not have the most optimal review on Yelp but the pictures of the food looked fantastic, it was reasonably priced, and the location was good.  So we took a risk, and EVERYONE in my party LOVED this place!  The food was delicious...not one item we ordered was bad, from the appetizer to the dessert.  The drinks were excellent and service was also very good.  We sat outside and people watched, while eating amazing food...could not beat that!  We all agreed to returning next time we were in Vegas and that this place was WAY better than Spago's next door!",

I've attended an event here, I've had happy hour here, I've ate inside, outside, and enjoyed each visit every time.  Because my friends weren't working at Ramsey's Pub or Cheesecake Factory we decided to come here.  Most recent visit the hostess accommodated my request to sit on the patio and along the railing.  I recognized Sun, the hostess, who showed us our way to the stairs from the Yelp event held here.    Service is okay and I don't like how dirty dishes are left on a tray next to tables but it's no health hazard.  I really like how open and wide the patio area is.  People watching is amazing if you're by the barricade.  We split a bottle since it looked like service wasn't going to be on the fast pace.    We split a Chateau Michelle Cold Creek Risling, native to Washington and as for my meal I had a Caesar salad appetizer and the Veal Scaloppine.  They were all amazing, I didn't eat my green beans because I'm still a kid and hate my veggies but the meal and atmosphere was pleasant.  It's pricey but give that you're on the strip, hey.",

Soft crusty bread is served with herb oil, so come hungry and you can indulge quickly. We ordered the salt & pepper calamari for appetizer 's but it was difficult to choose just one, all the apps looked delicious! And the Calamari- one of the best I've had! (and I'm from the Seattle area and we have many delicious seafood places to choose from.) Being an Italian restaurant, the wine list was extensive and my husband and I had delicious reds, but they also had some fun cocktails and menu of beers. Dinner: SPECTACULAR! Teens ordered the capellini with shrimp, hubby ordered their specialty pasta with clams, mussels and shrimp, and I had their lasagna. Perfect portioned entrees. Not humongous like many Italian restaurants. I wish I could've eaten more. 5+ stars!!We were Beyond satisfied (and full!!)",

One of our pasta dishes was not what I decided on, however I were so hungry I told the server it was fine and didn't want to ask for the right one.  The waiter came right away to apologize because there was a confusion in the back and when the check came that order was comped.  Food is tasty.....great for people watching.

I can not really give a True review on bar service since the bartender was still getting her bar set up and open. So yeah I was somewhat ignored but then again when you sit at the bar you tend to get much different service than at the table. But what little interaction I did have she seemed kind of annoyed that I chose to eat at the bar and not have a drink. I don't recall ever getting a smile from her but she wasn't overly rude either. The linguine seafood dish was good, better than the meal at Cafe Americano Sunday night. Had good texture to the shellfish, not over or under done especially the scallops. Nothing smelled or tasted fishy, the sauce was good a little flat for my liking but with all the components of the dish it didn't over power or hide any flavors of the seafood.  The noodles were cooked just right but my dish was not really that hot when it came out not sure if that was how it normally comes or what but I was so hungry and on a short lunch I just gobbled it down. It was not horrible by any means of being luke warm I kind of liked it that way. When ever I come back to Vegas or stay in ceasar palace I'll have to come by again.",

We ordered the chicken parmigiana and quite frankly we were so disappointed of the quality of the bake and the linguini was honestly so not what a pricy dish should taste like.  I had mineral water and had to ask twice for a refill.  Mind you the place was not busy so we did expect a better service.  So if you asked me? No, I wouldn't try this place again.",

We  had been to Trevi a few times over the past years and we're hoping that it was still delicious. Well it was fabulous and our server (Amyra) was an Angel. She really helped us with our orders and made us feel welcome and at home. We will be back. Excellent service and just a sweet girl.",

    "text": "This updated review pertains only to JOHN, the Trevi General Manager. He absolutely redeemed Trevi of their previous poor customer service experience that I reviewed from Dec.28, 2017.  I appreciate him very much for taking the time to call me personally on my cell, in the middle of his busy day, which I know is non stop in his restaurant. After he read the review of our less than stellar dining experience, he profusely expressed his regret about the incident and apologized. He acknowledged that it should have never happened in the first place, because they  pride themselves in providing first class customer service. Which is absolutely True. Caesar's and Paris and Bally's and Rio, basically the majority of Caesars entertainment properties I've been to on the Vegas strip, always live up to their elevated customer service reputation.   John expressed his understanding of my dissatisfaction, and invited me to give them another try next time I am in Vegas, and went as far as to advise me to contact him prior to that visit to make sure all goes smoothly. I don't always do second chances, however I valued John immensely for reaching out, understanding, and not dismissing my complaint. Sometimes all we want is just that, validation that our voice is heard, our opinion counts, and our business is appreciated. For that reason,  next time I'm in Vegas in a couple months, I will definitely give Trevi another shot. Even though I may do it \"mystery shopper\" style, so I get a realistic feel for how their service will live up to our expectations that time.   THANK YOU JOHN!!!",

You can sit inside or \"outside\" (not really outside of course).  The food is a combination of Italian classics and some new dishes.  The portions are reasonable - not massive like some other places.  And even though I was there by myself on a business trip, they didn't treat me any different or seat me in a hidden corner somewhere.  Reservations are highly suggested, especially on the weekends.  All in all, Trevi is a good bet while at the Forum Shops.",

Let me start by saying this was a treat! Started with appetizers which included oysters, mozzarella cheese, steak tar tar and complementary champagne.  So, we were off to a great start. We then opted to have Chef send out his recommendations for dinner. What a feast and great time we had.  The salmon was by far my favorite. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing. Then came the pastas which were all great bit the nookie and the stuffed lobster were amazing. We had steak, chicken, 3 types of pastas some great drinks and most of all a great time with friends. I definitely recommend Trevi for a nice dinner while you're in Vegas around Cesar's Palace Forum .  It's also great for people watching.",

It just melted in my mouth and was so delicious. two ladies ordered the pasta dish with a variety of seafood in it. It had ample amount of seafood of many types. Another had the short ribs and thought it was amazing. We had the caprese appetizer which was made with several types of heirloom tomatoes and buffalo cheese. It was the best thing I had eaten in Vegas until we got to my steak.  we tried a variety of desserts and they were all delicious as well I have two drinks from the bar and they were well-made.

    "text": "We've been here multiple times. I can't believe this is our first Yelp review on it.  Our first time here I believe it was 2 years ago, we had the very best service one could ask for. We've actually looked for the same waiter on our last 3 trips, but I don't think he works there anymore (Kevin Bacon) look alike.  My wife always gets Trevi's signature dish. The Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, its a medley of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions in a wonderful seafood cream sauce.  Its $30.00 and its her favorite dish in Las Vegas. Fresh pasta and just enough seafood so she can fish it all in one serving. My wife tried another seafood pasta dish at another place for like $23.00 and it was night and day. If you like a good meal try this, well worth the extra few dollars.  Like my wife I always get the same thing. I get the pepperoni pizza. I remember the first time , i was so hungry I finished the whole thing. Now I eat most of it and take a couple slices back to my room. its a thin crust pizza and very tasty. Not as greasy as other Pizza places.   Service a perfect 10 Time to serve -10 - we always get our food pretty quickly Atmosphere - 10 right in the middle of the forum shopping center.  Pros: Friendly service          Great food          Awesome location to people watch  Cons:  we haven't experienced anything negative.  Tips: for a causal experience eat in the patio. if you like a romantic setting opt for the dining room.  We will be back again!",

That ended tonight.   Showed up prior to reservation, the host began to take us to a table when another host whispered something to her which made her turn us around and quote \"15-20min\". I see several empty tables but maybe they are for something else. Then I witness couple after couple walk up to the stand without reservations are seated immediately. After 35min I'd had enough, so I decided to cut my losses and go home. Not like we could get in anywhere else nearby on a Sat night w/o a res. As I pull into my driveway, an hour after checking in, I receive a text that my table is ready.   My guess? They didn't like that I had a child with me. We eat here all the time with our kids and are always complimented on how well behaved they are, which is one reason we keep coming back. Guess I'll start celebrating my birthday week tomorrow. Thanks, Trevi, for wasting my evening.",

    "text": "This place has been my go-too Italian Restaurant in Vegas.  I come to Vegas quite often, so I rotate on various places to eat here and there.  Here is the break-down for this particular place.   When you take a sit, first take in the surroundings.  The fountain and the lighting is just amazing.  It sets the mood, and it feels like you are really on vacation coming here to eat.  It does get a little chilly, but the food will keep you warm.   I ordered the Fried Calamari and Special Chicken Pizza.   Food Quality: 9/10 The food was to die for.  The calamari came out fresh and hot, and was just the right type of crunch.  The squid tasted very real compared to places that mix in real and fake squid.  The texture was very consistent throughout, and the sauces were exceptional.   The pizza was just cooked to perfect.  Every-bite had great taste of the sauce, and the toppings were just cooked perfectly.  It was quite big, and therefore I was unable to finish it.   Service: 8/10 This is always a hit or miss.  The place was getting super busy, and sometimes the waiters forget about you.  I am a patient guy, so I did not mind the \"slightly\" longer wait time than usual.  It is best to know what you want if you expect to finish the food to catch a show that starts in about an hour.  I made it to the show thankfully.   Overall: 8.5/10 The place meets all the requirements for an Italian restaurant.  The food I ordered was amazing, and there were other foods that people ordered that was great as well.  I suggest trying the \"Spaghetti.\"  It has their signature meatballs which are to die for as well.  Everything looked so tasty, and the price is right for someone who does not want to spend too much in Vegas.",

The 'patio' seating by the fountain is more casual, but the inside seating is more formal with white tablecloths and comfortable chairs. The staff is friendly, not pretentious, and they are quite attentive. The signature seafood linguini is divine. It is served in a light cream sauce and the scallops and lobster were cooked perfectly. The chicken parmigiana was good, and the salmon salad contained a generous portion of salmon. The focaccia served with the salad was fresh. The price point is reasonable for Vegas, and it's a great location for dinner before a show at the coliseum.",

The best thing about dining here is that you can sit in the \"outdoor\" area next to the fountain which is very loud and full of tourists clicking and posing for pictures.  The service has never been overly friendly here but the food has usually been very good. Sadly on this visit it seemed more like an overpriced tourist trap.  I ordered my \"usual\" Frito Misto.  Gorgeous nibbles of veggies and seafood battered and lightly fried with a wonderful aoli dipping sauce.    My son ordered the shrimp cesar salad and it was nothing special for the price. A pepperoni pizza was shared and it was very good.  Light thin soft slices with lots of flavor.  We also shared some clam linguini and this was bland and boring.  Overall $100 later left me wishing it was worth it.  I may have to pick a new spot for my out of towners.",

There was not one complaint. The food was everything on point. They even gave my husband the Gooey Chocolate Cake with ice cream and a candle. The cake was shared amongst the 10 of us.

We booked a party of 8 for a Monday evening for our team dinner. We were attending a convention so it was business, but we knew we wanted a nice restaurant to let loose, celebrate all our hard work for the past year and to kick off and commemorate the upcoming year. It's our annual tradition.  This year, I got to pick the place... and after considerable amount of searching I discovered Trevi. And it was a great pleasure to have done so!   We got a little lost on the walk over so I called the hostess and she was so kind to help us figure out our journey and saved our spot for us because we were running a few minutes behind.  We arrive and they showed us to our table... a beautiful perfect gorgeous spot on the patio right next to the fountain - we couldn't have asked for any place better.   Immediately, DELICIOUS WARM BREAD was dropped off with this tasty mellow flavorful garlic dipping oil. It was just so good. We dove in.   Drinks were ordered. (all phenomenal, try the sangria! does not disappoint!) And our server Carlos kicked things off for us excellently. We had some funky requests (a practical joke to play on our boss) and he went with it. It was just so fun and refreshing to have customer service that goes above the norm. Thank you Carlos!   THE FOOD- woah the food. Appetizers: the mussels were some of the best we've ever had (and I'm a mussel snob, these were BOMB.COM) We also had calamari (another hit!) For dinner most of our table ordered the seafood pasta, one lasagna, a fish dish, and I had the prosciutto wrapped chicken. We ALL were so happy. Sometimes with large groups, mostly everyone is stoked, but there's always that one that is like man, I wish I didn't order this. NO. not here... EVERYONE was dying over how good everything was.   Then we got dessert (a gooey choc cake with a scoop of gelato) that we all shared. Also decadent.   Overall... I am SO excited to go back. The decor, service, food, price, experience, everything: my new favorite in Vegas.   Thank you Trevi! Stay how you are, please don't ever change. You rock!",

    "text": "I've been here about twice now.. and both times have been good.  It's a cute restaurant found inside Caesars Palace.. and its right by a giant fountain.    My boyfriend likes to go here whenever he wins big at the casinos.. so we made our way here on Saturday night.  It was about 8pm, and there was a 20 minute wait.  Not bad at all.  We started off with Calamari Fritti as our appetizer and for our main course, my boyfriend ordered his usual; Chicken Marsala and I ordered the Penne Diavalo.   They brought out some fresh warm bread for us after we got our calamari... I was wondering why they brought out our appetizer first but oh well.  The bread was good, but I was trying not to eat too much before my pasta came out.  The Calamari was delicious.  Pretty decent size to share between two people.  Loved the dipping sauce and how crispy/flaky the calamari was on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside.  Yum.  Boyfriend really enjoyed his Chicken Marsala as usual.  He did make a comment about how the presentation looked different this time and how the previous time he ordered, the dish did not come with pasta but it did this time.  So props for that; adding more food to the dish (;  I enjoyed my Penne Diavalo.. but I was slightly disappointed that it had no hint of spice at all.. even though the description said \"spicy\" and even my waitress asked if I was okay with spice... how deceiving.  Overall, it was a decent dish.. I think they added a little bit too much sundried tomatos.. and it would've been nice if the chicken came cut up in chunks or something.. rather than huge slabs here and there, mixed into my pasta.  I'll probably order something else next time since this dish didn't exactly \"wow\" me.   Prices are a little steep for pasta... we ordered the vodka ravioli and it was almost $20 alone.. but it's Vegas; what do you expect?  Service is good, my waitress constantly brought out refills for us without having to ask for props for that.    Overall, it's a nice place to dine with your significant other in Vegas... but I'm pretty sure there are better places out there.. so I guess I'd only recommend this place if you're heavily craving Italian food or around the area?",

    "text": "Trevi was a great spot to grab lunch while shopping at Caesar's.  We were seated immediately, and chose to sit on the patio (not really outside, just overlooking the Forum Shops).  The inside is very pretty, but felt much too fancy for a casual lunch.    The bar in the middle of the restaurant offers seating inside and on the patio, and the happy hour offers were pretty enticing.  The signature drink is a frozen Bellini that really was more tart than sweet.  I don't think you'd want more than one, but it's definitely a nice, refreshing cocktail to try.  Drink and food prices are very reasonable, even by Vegas standards.  We just wanted a light lunch, so we each chose the shrimp cocktail and one of the daily soups.  I had a the Minestrone soup and it was brimming with hearty chunks of vegetables and a variety of beans, definitely more filling than I thought, but also way more delicious.  My husband had the tomato basil soup, and it was creamy but not too heavy - with a light hint of basil.   The shrimp cocktail was our favorite item - it came with a nice little side salad packed with flavor and textures, and a tangy cocktail sauce.  It truly could have been a meal in itself!    Service was quick and friendly, and they ask you if you would like bread service instead of just putting it on the table, a nice gesture during a light lunch.    If you are looking for a laid back but still upscale lunch spot while shopping at Caesar's then Trevi is a great spot.    Cheers!",

    "text": "We stopped here for lunch after meeting up with family from the East coast.  We told the hostess that we wanted to order from the happy hour menu, and she told us we had to physically sit at the bar, and not at one of the many empty bar tables.  Ok, if that's their policy, but it seemed strange.  We were seated, and then told by the bartender (who clearly was unhappy to be at work) that we needed to wait five minutes before ordering, or she would charge regular price - again, it just seemed odd.  Among our group, we ordered the frozen Bellini (way too sweet, not good at all), the Trevetini (awful, cloyingly sweet and had an artificial taste), a lemon martini (ok, but VERY sweet),  beer (in bottles, hard to mess up), and some mixed drinks (very little alcohol, but ok).  We ordered one of each of the happy hour \"bites,\" I think.  They were mostly ok, but tasted like they were frozen and then heated up.  The calamari was pretty good, but the sauce it was served with was stone-cold (possibly intentional?).  The meatballs were pretty good, as well; they tasted like grocery-store quality frozen meatballs.  The stuffed mushrooms were decent, but oily.  The chicken sliders were not good - tough chicken with oily breading, awful.     Then, when a second bartender asked if we wanted anything else and we had replied \"No, thanks,\" she seriously threw the bill at us (it had been folded in a glass in front of us) and stomped off.  It wasn't crowded, there wasn't anyone waiting for our seats, and we still had drinks which were half full in front of us.  Very odd.   Overall, the food was adequate but the service was appalling.  We laughed it off at the time, but now I wish I had asked for a manager - it was truly awful service.",

    "text": "Trevi is a really cute restaurant in Caesar's Palace.  I ate here for the first time last weekend when I took a Vegas trip with my bf.  We wanted to have a cute dinner on our first night there and passed by Trevi and knew it was our place, after having passed by a number of other restaurants which we decided to skip.  Trevi was an excellent choice.  The service was great, the food was delicious, and the scenery is nice. The lights are dimmed and it's right next to a large Roman fountain in the middle of the forum shops in Caesar's.  I thought the food was pretty good, but probably not the best I've ever had.  It was pretty pricey.  I got a pesto pasta with sundried tomatoes (one of my favorite things) and it came with shrimp, but I felt like there wasn't enough shrimp in it.  There was a LOT of food and I definitely could not finish it.  I felt bad leaving a lot on the plate.  I would normally take food to go but we were planning on going to go out dancing after that so we had nowhere to put leftovers.  While the food was tasty, it was a bit expensive for what we got.  My boyfriend really liked his veal, though.  In all, it was a great choice and I'd definitely check this place out again.  It's cute, romantic, and OH - they have AMAZING drinks!  We both got a fruity drink which was deceptively strong!  It was probably the best drink I had during the trip and I would definitely stop by there to get another one next time I'm in the area.   Trevi is excellent!",

I was really disappointed.. it was totally an American Pizza.   The good side was the ciabatta bread they served & the tuna tartar appetizer (mind you..not very italian hahaha..with the avocado and all) although it was still really really good.  All in all, food is pretty average. The up side is that you are conveniently located in Caesar's and the ambiance is pretty nice, too.  Pros: + good service + nice location in Caesars, and nice decor + I really liked the background music too, all italian  Cons: - very americanized Italian food. Although I was expecting this as the name of the restaurant is very cliche",

We ordered an appetizer with fried calamari, mixed veggies, scallops, and shrimp (I do not recall the name) which was delicious.

I told the waiter the noodles were a bit undercooked and he informed me they were cooked \"al dente\" and that they are supposed to be that way... BS. If I wanted raw noodles, I'd ask for them that way.   Anytime I try a new restaurant I get something I'm familiar with so I have something to base it off of... Trevi's bolognese was a no go.  Their tables and chairs are also not very comfortable. You move your feet, you hit one of the table legs. You move your body, your chair wobbles with you.   Pick another restaurant...

I researched the venue to have the typical requirements: location, ambiance, affordable and good food.  We were seated quickly at a large table located near the fountain.  Our host was a bit dry and unengaging especially since it was a bachelorette dinner, I was expecting a little more personality.  I mean, I wasnt expecting him to strip down or anything but it was a special occassion, lighten up!    I don't recall what we all ordered exactly but we were all generally pleased with the food portions and quality.  I personally think that if we had a more lively and engaging host, our vibe wouldve been so different.  We enjoyed some conversation, had a round of shots, had dinner and departed.",

I wouldn't bother. -sheets of pasta with spinach and ricotta and mushroom sauce (can't remember the name on the menu..) - pretty good, it came in this extremely creamy sauce though. It wasn't what I had expected, I guess I thought it would be more like stuffed pasta with a mushroom sauce. It wasn't bad, I wish I had gotten something else though, like the chicken cannelloni! If you like spinach, lots of creamy sauce, and chunks of pasta, get this lol.  Service: NOT good. Our server was just grumpy, not happy to be there, didn't check on us, and pretty much ignored us (and the table next to us..)

The outside is in the heart of Casear's forum shops, which is great for the favorite pastime of people watching.  Cost: 4. When I'm Vegas, I have a tendency to ignore menu prices altogether and I hope most of you end up doing the same. However, Trevi actually offers a surprisingly good menu for the price especially by Las Vegas standards.  Food Quality: 3. Tempted to give a four, but nothing blew us away enough to truly justify that.  Solid highlights include Chicken Cannelloni and Chicken Limone. Chicken Limone was supposedly \"best thing on the menu\" according to waitress, and good no doubt, but nothing to salivate over.  Service: 3. Waitress spotty, plus it took Trevi 10-15 minutes just to come to our table after we sat down --  other than that no huge complaints.  When to return: A quick bite when shopping at forum shops, in a hurry before a show or flight, no reservations place to eat on a Thur/Fri/Sat night.  One tip -- food wise, you're probably better off trying to eat at Spago's (practically next door) bar menu area, which in my opinion is modestly better for a similar price.",

    "text": "I came here with a friend on my past trip to vegas. (Wish I could go back already)   We were walking around the Forum Shops at Caesar's and came across this place. We were distracted by the delicious looking pizza everyone was eating. After looking at their menu, we decided to give it a try.   We sat at the bar since it was just us two. We got there during happy hour and totally didn't realize how late it was.. It was about 4/5pm but it only felt like it was 1 or 2pm.. (Time difference was so hard to get used to at first) Not to mention that they weren't even crowded. It is usually crowded at places during happy hour back at home but I'm glad we didn't have to deal with crowds.   At the bar we ordered some drinks to try.. When in Rome right? Or in this case, Vegas. I got their Frozen Bellini which was like a slurpee.. it was awesome! If you know me, I don't like drinks that have a strong taste of alcohol and I like prissy drinks lol. Not to mention I don't really drink. But when you're on vacation.....  We ordered the butt load of food for two people.. Tomato Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms, Fried Calamari (a must for my friend every time we go out) and a pizza. It was all so yummy.   Service was great and I thought that the price was reasonable for happy hour. But then again when you're on vacation you don't really look at the price =/   Here's the link to their happy hour menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trevi-italian.com%2Fpdf%2Fmenus%2FTRVI_happ.pdf&s=b882388a770ad991fe35ace51292ec2d3299a09ed98c366d85ace56af54f8649\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">trevi-italian.com/pdf/me...</a>",

The prices are reasonable for Vegas and the ambiance is hard to beat. Highly recommended if you're in the area.  If you had to try one thing, get their signature dish Linguine al Frutti de Mare. It's a fancy version of a seafood pasta and it ranks among the best pasta dishes we've ever had. You know... the type where you want to lick the plate clean. The dish smells excellent and has a rich creamy flavor to it (not too creamy like regular alfredo sauce). The seafood (lobsters, shrimps, scallops) are all cooked perfectly and come in generous portions. The sauce tastes like lobster bisque, flavorful but not too heavy.",

When we asked to speak to the manager he  was very rude and sarcastic. He asked if what we wanted was more bread if that was the problem. We explained the poor service and he said he would take 20% off when the bill comes back he didn't do that. When asked about he come back yelling making a scene in front of customers. He was pointing fingers at us and kicked us out. He was being very rude and unprofessional. His name is John and we were told he was the General Manager. Worst restaurant.",

I think you can get them half price at the bar during happy hour.  I was deciding between the chicken parmesan and the spaghetti and meatballs.  Based on the waiter's advice I chose the spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed. This was probably the best spaghetti and meatballs I've had had at a restaurant. The pasta was cooked perfectly. The meatballs where slightly crispy on the outside and tender inside. The marina sauce was slightly sweet which I love.   This is not your typical over salted over garlic Italian.  If in the area I recommend giving it a try.",

Splendid Cosmo for me and a girly Peach Bellini for my big husband! Lol! Salads were just mediocre, (Trevi and a Beet & Carrot one), but excellent drinks and tasty entrees made up for so-so salads. Rufus recommended special Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, etc.), which my husband said was delicious! I was equally happy with my Capellini Bianca (shrimp & lump crab w/angel hair). Both served in a white cream sauce that was Uber-light! So happy it was not a heavy cream sauce that would weigh us down in the Vegas heat! The addition of eating under the fountains with King Neptune, surrounded by exquisite high-end shops, under a painted faux sky ceiling...BELLISSIMO!!!",

Well, apparently late night happy hour is for those at the bar. The hostess told us to ask our waiter if it's cool to order from happy hour because there was no room at the bar.  So let me ask you, have you ever felt like your waiter/waitress thought you were a group of cheap people who weren't going to order a lot and thus not tip a lot? Neither had I, until Trevi.  Mind you, at the time, there was literally NO ONE ELSE in the indoor area - as everyone was either on the patio or at the bar. You would also think our waiter would be thrilled to have people to help, especially a group of 8 famished adults.  We ordered drinks and he took our order. It was incredible to see his attitude change when only a couple ordered off the happy hour menu and the rest of us ordered standard dishes. After we ordered, everything else was great. Food was nice (the pasta my wife and I shared was split for us, without having to ask), portions were solid, and the ambiance was enjoyable.  3-star rating is basically 1 star for the treatment we received up until we ordered, coupled with 5 stars for the treatment and experience after that.",

I'm a big fan of peach-champagne-slushy drinks, and comparing this to the Wallaby Darned at Outback (truly sickeningly sweet!) you'll find it's just watery enough to go down smooth but sweet enough to neutralize any bitter alcoholic taste.  I had the seafood pasta with bits of lobster, shrimp, and scallops floating around in a cream sauce.  The plate seemed to get deeper the more I ate.  Neither my friend or I could get to the bottom of our endless pasta!  At some point, I gave up and just started digging around with my fork for lobster and seafood bits.  I found many.    The bartender was extremely friendly and the service was normal speed for a Sunday afternoon in Vegas (ie, kind of slow since everyone is trying to cure their hangover by eating).  The bar area lends itself well to meeting fellow travelers and discussing potential meal options and day plans.  The people we were seated next to had a way with words and told us some stories about Italy, getting into restaurants barefoot, and track n' field.  All in all, on the pricey side but well worth your money, time, and maybe a quick snapshot of the fountain.",

Beautiful location at the heart of Caesars Palace, and pretty easy to find right next to the Fountain of the Gods.

We got there, and bypassed 5 people who shot evil looks at me in line (but didn't say anything to me) and we were ushered to our table next to oval bar promptly. I'm glad that we opted to sit inside the restaurant rather than out in their \"courtyard\" as it was very noisy... Noise from the water crashing over the fountain, hundreds of people meandering around, would have made conversation nearly impossible.   We started with the pepperoni pizza as our appetizer from their brick oven. OMG, the crust was awesome! Super thin, reminiscient to naan...  ordered a few specialty cocktails. I had the veal parmigiana- lightly breaded veal in romano bread with a small amount of linguini pomodoro and washed it down with a nice big glass of 14 Hands cab. sauv.   Our server was pretty good, but I did have to request my wine twice and was half way done with my meal by the time it came out to me.

The sound of the fountain with the fresco ceiling and lighting made you feel as if you were in Rome!  The real reason we kept coming back was the outstanding service at the bar.  Primarily, Pablo.  He can run circles around any NY bar tender.  AMAZING.  The variety of wines, drinks and ambience along will bring us back again.",

Chicken Parmigana is huge, meatballs are huge as well.   I would recommend Trevi Salad which is delicious.   Also a great place to people watch if sitting outside.",

    "text": "This was amazing! We were able to stop just before the lunch rush! My husband ordered a Peach Bellini, that I ended up drinking most of. It was fresh and bold and just the perfect amount of alcohol. We shared the Lasagna Deep Dish Pizza, it was more than we could finish. That pizza is unique and filling and the ricotta cheese oh so rich! I wanted to try the cannoli, but we were honestly too full for more, but the table next to us ordered it and it looked divine! We will definitely stop here again!",

    "text": "I was staring as we walked the Forum Shops at Caesars. We came across Trevi and thought we would give it a try. My husband ordered the shrimp cocktail. It was around $16. I was surprised he got 5 huge shrimp (3 bites per shrimp) on a nice bed of ice. The shrimp were firm and cold. DELICIOUS! I ordered the lunch special Caesar Chicken Salad wrap it included french fries. It was around $18. It too was a big portion (I ended up sharing with the hubby) The wrap was a flat bread nicely toasted. After we ordered the food server said she would bring us bread it took a while to get that. I wouldn't go here if you are in a hurry. The food is prepared to order and it shows. Yummy!!! We loved the outdoor seating and a great view of the Forum Shops. I will be back the next time we go.",

Even the parts with no sausage had the flavor! We were served many dishes - pasta pomodoro, an Alfredo linguini, bruschetta, antipasto, margherita pizza. Service was excellent, food amazing. I'll be back!",

    "text": "We made dinner reservations here for our group of 16.  They had the table ready on time.  The service was decent for a large group, but our server did miss a few people at times.  The food is ok.  We ordered several appetizers for the table.  I will say the beef carpaccio was quite tasty.  The little bits of toast and the fresh cheese made it a nice treat.  The other appetizers were standard fair for an Italian chain restaurant.  For my meal i ordered the veal parmigiana.  I rarely get to eat veal so i generally pounce on the opportunity when it presents itself.  The meal was ok.  I was not impressed at all.  I would expect the same quality at a national chain.  I ordered the tiramisu for dessert.  It was pretty good.  It was a large portion.  Overall this place is ok.  Unfortunately it is no better than the standard national italian chains.  I was hoping to avoid the chain level of food.",

    "text": "So I can agree with some of the other reviews.  a) it is overpriced-you're going to be paying north of $20 for an entree for lunch without a side nor salad to start with b) the fountain is loud, but you are in the middle of the mall after all c) they took the polenta fries off the menu-now that's a crime d) keep in mind there's no 'food court' per se in this mall so your choices are going to be limited-The Palms, Spagos, Joe's Stone Crab [not to be confused with Joe's Crab Shack--another crime], RA sushi, BOA -- all high end restaurants so you are going to be paying either way for food here e) their bread is good. and I liked my entree fair enough [lemon artichoke grilled chicken pasta something or other]. I'm not dying to go back there just for this entree but you get my point f) they have a bar, apparently a happy hour, and they have TV's so if you are hungry & your price elastic it will do the trick",

    "text": "My best friend and I were shopping at ceasers and stumbled upon this place to get dinner.  The only downside was waiting 30 min for a table (and the rude hostess with blonde hair), but once we got in everything was amazing, from the atmosphere, fountain, lighting, ambiance to the food, service and dessert. We got the margarita pizza (which does has sauce and very similar to ones in italy) and the ravioli vodka (very rich and filling, good for pasta lovers).  For dessert we had the cheesecake which was AWESOME. So huge that you really do have to share it, or you'll have it for leftovers! Our drinks were awesome as well, I had the italian margarita which was mixed perfectly, strong yet sweet thanks to the contreiu, I def reccomend it, and also the frozen coral crush was delicious. It is sweet, tastes like mango, looks like an orange pina colada but it also alcoholic!",

    "text": "This looked like such a nice place to dine right next to the fountain. Looking at the price I expected this to be fine dinning, however what we experience was nothing short of a complete joke on us! My wife ordered the Chicken Piccata, and I ordered their best dish the Linguine Fruitti Di Mare. Both of these dish were also their most expensive so we thought this was going to be something great.   Our server was horrible as she never smile or even said what her name was. This turned out to be a series of neglect and just bad service. Had to ask her three times to get a lemon for my water. Brought us bread and pour a little olive oil into the dish and started to walk away. Thus had to ask for some vinegar which she finally got from another table after the third request. Then we had to ask for a napkin and silverware as we did not have any on the table.   By this time we had to inform the manager that our server may be overworked or too much for her to handle. The manager apologized however the service only got worst. We had to ask for refill of our coffee each time. You would think this is so basic customer service to keep the coffee cup full especially since the cups were clear glass.   To top it off our Not so great server managed to drop a beer bottle on an empty chair at our table which got beer on my wife new shoes. The manager later came over and said that the server had told him what had just happened. He tried to apologize and only made a joke that lucky it wasn't wine. He did offer a desert, but we didn't want to take any chance for another disaster!   Well we finally got the bill and noticed that there was no comp or discount. Actually when the server brought me my change back she said that they round off my bill so I guess I did get a price reduction of eight cents! Despite all this and wanting to leave a penny tip I decide not to lower myself and instead of giving my usual 20+% for gratuity I gave around 17% so I could still feel good that I could say that I still gave a fair tip since my mother was a server for many years of hard work.    One final note and the food was not fine dinning but rather okay. Guess I need to really check Yelp for now on before choosing where to eat and definitely before dinning out!",
