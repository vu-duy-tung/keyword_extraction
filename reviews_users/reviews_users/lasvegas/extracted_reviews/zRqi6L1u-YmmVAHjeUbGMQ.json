I eat 95% healthy and hate going out to eat because I can taste the chemicals and preservatives in foods and most places just don't give a shit.  FOOD IS HEALTHY AND EXCELLENT TASTING and everyone there was super nice.  My ahi tacos were made fresh, placed in a plate with holders so there was no mess and tasted amazing.  My 21 year old daughter's food was great as well.  Two menus let you order super healthy or just a little less but it all taste great.  Looking for a place in Vegas other than $60 casino lunch or a buffet colon blowout, find one of these SkinnyFats and you will not only save a lot of money but enjoy a very, very delicious HEALTHY meal.",

Mainly people waiting until the very last second to decide what they want, however, they should have two cashiers instead of one, especially on busier days like Sunday's.  Asked for the steakation but requested to have the sandwich with sourdough bread instead of the multigrain bun. Still got the multigrain bun, a sad amount of meat and aioli, fries were soggy, and to top it off there was a long piece of blue hair in my sandwich.  Needless to say, not going back.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend wanted to make note of the amazing customer service Chasen an employee of this establishment has.  We were there last night (8/5/15) after a really terrible early dinner. We got 2 Ahi Siracha and sweet potato fries with truffle sauce/dressing & 2 drinks.   We patiently waited for an hour.  Wondering where the food was as others that came after us already ate and left.  We made mention to a passing waiter -- but it was Chasen that actually was the most professional. He introduced himself and made sure he checked on our meals. As well as keep checking back periodically to make sure we left with a smile.   Not only did he corrected the situation. Simpathized with our situation. And went above and beyond expectations. And took it upon himself to represent the company in the most positive light.  Simply saying \"we don't roll like that.\" Implying that SkinnyFats is an establishment that does care or doesn't want anyone to feel less important as a customer.   To find this is already few and far inbetween for places in Las Vegas. This place and it's employees  (Notably Chasen) -- make a place worth going to time and time again.  And the amazing food is a plus!!  I hope that management will see and recogize this individual.  Hospitality + customer service + speaking to you like a fellow human = EXCELLENCE   I hope this never changes about this place as I will always refer my friends and family here!!  I will attach Chasen's photo here shortly (on the left) with my BF to the right.",

With the healthy side available, we were still able to enjoy the taste of the happy side with just better, healthier alternatives.  It's kind of a hit or miss here in this restaurant. One time I ordered the chicken and waffle and the chicken was so dry it turned me off to the whole dish. I tried it again the next time just to see if there would be a difference and it was cooked better than it was the first time.   Everything I've tried on their menu so far, either on the happy or healthy side, has been satisfying and rarely ever disappointing. 4 star for the overall concept of the restaurant.",

    "text": "With two locations and more on the way, SkinnyFats has the formula to expand to even  greater heights -- healthy and not-so-healthy versions of classics plus some creative dishes thrown into the mix in a fast-casual, affordable, hip setting.   The larger interior is a welcomed change from their first location and I'm a big fan of their outdoor patio when the weather is nice. After many visits to both locations, the food may not seem as innovative as it once was, but it's still some of the best I can find for a fast meal.  The sweet cheese us ($12) is always overflowing with shaved NY strip, peppers, onions and mushrooms. It's one of my favorite steak and cheese sandwiches when I need a quick fix. For something healthier, the skinny Q flatbread ($7) was decent with it's crispy crust and moderate amount of grilled chicken, cheddar and red onions covered with an agave BBQ sauce.  They've got a kid's menu too, but my son prefers a side of grilled chicken ($4) over their chicken tenders. Their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good. Served warm, the edges were slightly crispy, with a chewy and moist interior.  This location always seems to be busy during peak hours so it's best to hit it up at other times. Still, for a quick meal there are few places that are better.",

Ive tried many things on the menu and everything i try has great flavor and it is a really good portion for what you pay. My favorite meal that i always tend to get when i walk into any skinnyfats is the meltdown. A double patty, patty melt tyoe of burger with the sweet potato fries. Those fries are definitely the best sweet potato fries ive tried so far. Nice and crispy and soft on the inside dashed with a little salt to even out the playing ground for the sweetness of the fries.  this place is always consistent on the food and service which is why i always go back for a good meal.",

My son's favorite Cherry Popper was delicious as always. I had the Cranburkey, without cranberries, made to order excellent turkey burger. Overall great meal and customer service.",

    "text": "If you've never been to SkinnyFATS, then you're probably in for a treat. At least that's what Toni and I thought after walking into the Warm Springs location. At first walking into the two front doors felt like we had just been transported into a friendly neighborhoods backyard, complete with friendly greetings from the staff and chatty tables all around. If I could pinpoint a feel to it, it would be the, \"Casual California Weekend Backyard Meetup\" feel. There was also an outdoors section which was a welcomed sight to see, complete with backyard wood fence and comfortable seating between both sides.  The walls are colorful with wood boarded styles. The staff is clearly visible working the meals and making sure they go out within reasonable times through a kitchen half window. The front counter shows the large selection of funny titled selections, including sections that clearly distinguish between healthy conscience choices and the equally awesome listings by the simple color and title columns of \"Healthy\" & \"Happy\".   In between Toni and I getting the cleverly hilarious food titles and possible movie references, we wondered on how the healthy and happy choices actually differed, but then we just looked at our hungry faces and shrugged and ordered what sounded good to us. There were several choices, most of them with their own sections and categories between sandwiches and bowls and even breakfast sections and pressed healthy juices and desserts.  On the drinks side, we were surprised with the lack of usual labels only to be equally excited about trying some real cane sugar sodas. Something that is usually overlooked until you try to scratch the recesses of your mind and picture something similar or better than the Jones sodas you randomly had growing up, then combining that with all of them being different flavors coming out of a soda fountain. Our minds were blown as we were recommended by the lovely cashier to try out and mix \"Cream Soda\" and \"Black Cherry\" and we just let it happen. I had one of the two unsweetened (I'm diabetic) iced tea flavors and some of the cucumber iced water.   Toni decided on the \"Bomb Diggity\" - \"applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, lemon herb aioli on sourdough, sandwich.\"  that came with some \"delicious\" sweet potato fries on the side. I'm not sure if that was due to us being hungry or the sandwich just being that good but her only complaint was that the bread was a little rough. It's sourdough, it was meant to be a little rough around the edges, it's not the bread's fault.  I decided to go with the \"Hot Chix\" salad bowl. \"Chopped buffalo chicken, bleu cheese, pico, avocado and fried jalapeno strips over romaine tossed in a buffalo ranch.\"  Clearly the winner here for healthy choices. Not only did I get the awesome taste of some well-cooked seasoned boneless buffalo chicken nuggets tossed with greens, but the blend of ranch and avocado presented in such a way that was inviting and not just clearly tossing my salad (apologies). As far as condiments, They had their own signature sauces which were flavorful and delicious on specific plates, but I had to give them props for including the rare green habanero hot sauce. Though the food was amazing on it's own, I love me some spice as well as flavor, and the 3rd party habanero hot sauce was a definite welcome in my book. Tapatio would have been my second choice instead of Cholula.  The portions were great and the music and atmosphere complimented our mood of just feel good eats and laid back Bob Marley-like chill tunes. If there was anything else I would have changed, it wouldn't have been as balanced as what they have done with this well-liked and awesome location.   The Good * Great original food and drink selections * Laid back atmosphere and music selection * Service with a genuine smile and decent order to table times.  The Bad * Only 2 locations (Dean Martin and Warm Springs)  Bottom Line SkinnyFATS is a place for great original food at pretty decent prices without all the bling and glam of the inner city. You just head there with the mentality to kick back, enjoy some happy & healthy dishes, drinks and bring some friends as they will most likely thank you for it. Just make sure they return the favor the next time they suggest heading out anywhere. Toni and I loved it and we will definitely be making the Warm Springs location one of our favorite spots in town.",

The only thing that is less than favorable is the parking lot situation; it gets super packed at lunch and dinner time.  On lazy nights, it's the best alternative to actually cooking dinner for me and my love.  We're so addicted to their delicious, healthy options.  So here's a quick rundown:  50% of the menu contains calorie conscious choices, 50% of the menu is the 'Do anything--no holds barred' choices, with 50% of each choice being breakfast, and then 100% of everything they offer, delicious.  I've tried quite a few of their menu offerings, and to date everything I've tried has been amazing.  My absolute favorite is the Flat Chix, which consists of chicken breast covered in arugula, capers, tomato, red onion, cucumber, caper vinaigrette & balsamic reduction.  His top pick is the Naked Chix, which has seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, topped with cilantro yogurt.  Other items of noteworthy mention include the:   Wrap Supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a whole wheat tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt  Slow Boat to China - Asian chicken salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli  Smoke in a Bowl - Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt  Also worth noting, you can add extra protein choices to any dish, or swap out the meat selection.  I'm kind of an ahi nut, so when I'm feeling splurgey I add on ahi to my dish. The add-on protein choices include chicken, portobello, steak, ahi, or shrimp.",

Hubbies best man said let's goto this place becuase it was like a healthy portion that he could have compared to our decision of going to robertos tacos....  Walked in and the decor was so awsome! Very chic and stylish and laid back. You just feel care free and kind of keeps your eyes constantly busy. Everything seemed refurbished like using crates to build high counter chairs and just pieces if wood painted to decor the walls and create the benches on the cute little patio. They have an open kitchen to be able to see all the delicious different foods that come out along with being able to see all the kitchen staff work so hard and still be happy ahahahaha.  Me being me i couldn't just try one thing coming into dine somewhere for the first time and I definately thought it would be more resteraunt style where I could sit and study the menu and after seeing the pictures of the food I totally thought it was a sit down resteraunt, but boi was i wrong! You first order at the he register and then they deliver the food to you and you get to grab your own drinks.  This place has 2 different concepts which is absolutely AWSOME for me becuase a lot of my friends are very healthy and i just am NOT! They have such a variety from SMOOTHIES....COOKIES....BREAKFAST....SHAKES....KIDS MEALS.... DESSERTS...SOUTHERN....AMERICAN....ASIAN...THE WHOLE SHABANG! Luckily we had three people in my group so what I ordered didn't seem too extreme if it were to be just me and hubby but this is what we did  CHICKAWAFFADOPOLIS $12 * must say I was quite impressed with light batter on the chicken & the waffle was thick fluffy & crispy  REDICULOUS $11 * just the right amount of sweetness & some fresh fruit to cut through the creamy cream cheese frosting  WTFRENCHTOAST $10 * friend had this & it was the least of my fav.  HAPPYMESS  $10 * this was ORGASMIC addiction in my mouth with so many different flavors especially with the add on of a sunny side egg & Bleu cheese with diced tomatoes  ONE-EYED MONSTER $7 * creamy gravy goodness with a sunny side egg & some bacon strips  PIZZA-WAFF-ADOPOLIS $11 * just a pizza on a waffle... a twist of a pizza  LIQUID DEFENSE $8.50 * definately more on the healthy side   PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE * they bake it for you!!   STRAWBERRY-BANANA-NUTELLA SHAKE * love it but I only WISH that they had WHOLE MILK for the fatty side of people like me hahaha  They also have different kind of soda which aren't Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is unique  This was my first meal of the day and it was a Kickstart to an awsome day & I will definately be back to try many more new items along with the ones I have tried as well !!",

I'm only going to review on 2 dishes since that's all I tasted. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a good crispy skin, but the chicken itself was a little bit dry and I thought the waffle lacked flavor. I asked my niece who ordered the same thing how she liked it and she also said that her chicken was a little dry. On a good note, my hubby ordered the S'motherload which includes filet mignon, egg, sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions and pico in a tortilla w/ cajun cheese sauce. I really enjoyed his dish and ended up picking off his plate",

However the first night I ate at this new location I found plastic in my food, annoyed, but the manager was there and gave me a gift card to make up for it, and the next time I came the food was great.   However the time after that I found hair in my food as well as in the food of the person I was with. I didn't bring it up to anyone because I didn't want to create a scene.   I ate here a few more times after that and the food was good. However, this last time I got a meal to go, my chicken was nearly raw in the middle and I couldn't eat my meal, because I got it to go I couldn't go and complain and instead had to throw my $8 meal away. I'm not one to write reviews but with so many incidents I just had to speak out.  The food is so good if only the quality was as well!",

I turned around to the guy in back of us to confirm that we were at the start of the line and he said yes. None of made a fuss, I guess we just want to eat and have a good day. What I was thinking though was the lack of concern and attentiveness of the girl cashier w/the lip ring and not let the couple know that she bypassed the line and patrons waiting patiently. The food was not bad though. My wife had a chicken salad wrap which was really good, but I will pass next time on my waffle and berries. The best thing we had there was their fresh made juices.",

    "text": "I like  the food, five stars, but the last three times I have felt the service was just above a fast food order by number place   Tonight the family and I went. We ordered at the counter and our food came a while later. I have two kids and they always order the clucky toes. Kids grabbed a table and wife and I ordered. I ordered their clucky toes with plain fries.   Food comes and there is only one order of clucky toes. I told the server we are waiting on another order and a minute later the cashier (Asian female with an attitude) comes over and says \"you didn't order two orders of those ) and drops the receipt on the table to show me. To her   Credit she read the order back to me when I paid, but I could not hear her so I just said \" sounds good\". There was a crying kid right next to me in line.   Here is where it went south. I have ordered for my kids for the last 10 years. I have never, not once, forgot to order for one of them. In fact, when said Asian female with attitude took my order , she said \"you want plain fries in both of them?\"  It was almost like I was made to feel like I was trying to cheat the system the way she accused me.   Maybe a better approach would have been, \"I'm sorry, I checked the receipt and there was only one order paid for.\"  But it got worse.   I told her, well I need another order as my daughter has no food to eat and I pulled out cash to pay (I am not trying to cheat the system and am happy to pay if an order was not charged for ).  She walks to the kitchen and asked the chef to fire another order because \" he forgot to order them\".   Listen, I am not cheap, I pay for my stuff, but maybe some training for the staff would be nice. There is an easy way to not accuse anyone of forgetting and still get to a happy outcome     I've been here prob 20 times since they opened in Sept, and have never forgotten to order for my kids.   Next time try the , I'm sorry it looks like only one was billed\" approach.   I also think the food is not as good as when they opened. I'll come back, but for for a while",

The service is always with a smile and the knowledge of the menu is super helpful for me as i allow the employees sometimes to just order for me so thanks! Id say the only negative here is the parking situation... a little tight but cannot be helped given the location.

Sandwiches have less on them, now dry... less cranberry sauce on the Cranburkey, less hummus now made of beets (?!) on the Chickhumm.  Flat Chix, Hot Chix, and Wake N' Bacon are still good. Cookies and juices are great. Employees have always been incredible nice.   I'm sad with menu change, maybe there will be better menu changes in the future based on customer response, but if you're here for the first time this is a healthy and unique dining spot in Vegas.",

I have gotten most everything on the \"Healthy\" Menu, and have indulged several times on the \"Happy\" Menu (Ok maybe more than several times ;))   I have to say that I don't feel like I am eating \"healthy\" food because all of the items on the menu are so tasty and don't feel like they are missing cheese or butter aioli. However, when I eat the \"happy\" menu, while I am very happy I also feel very heavy! haha. But what I love about this place is that when I am on a mission to get healthier, we can still dine here and my husband can order off either menu and doesn't feel like I am forcing him onto my diet.   The only thing I can say is that I don't think the location is as good as Dean Martin, but the lines are definitely shorter which is a plus! And I think the menu could be enlarged and the prices reduced. Case in point, the buffalo cauliflower is very tasty and healthy, but it is over $6 for a handful of Cauliflower. Compared with an ahi taco for a similar price which is way more filling and made with more expensive ingredients. I would suggest more consistency in their prices. However, this is a good restaurant and I will continue to enjoy it there!",

They brought out the bowl and house salad first and said the tacos were coming up. Those were both delicious but the reason why I am giving 1 star is that they took forever to bring out the tacos and what was found inside the taco. My husband was done with his meal by the time they brought them out. One of the employees said that we would recieve a refund for the tacos taking so long. I got a to go box once the tacos came out. We had to leave by the time we got them. When I was eating the tacos in the car I bit into the taco and there was an eggshell inside.

I ordered the S'motherload ($11.99), which is a breakfast style burrito with steak, sausage, and peppers, mushrooms, pico included. My friend ordered the Hot Mess, which is a bowl that includes  flour tortilla, chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalapenos, sour cream & jalapeno ranch sauce ($9.95).  The S'motherlod was actually pretty good. This isn't a burrito that was meant to be picked up and eaten, but enjoyed using a fork and spoon. It was good, but not nearly worth the price tag. More like $7 dollars.  The Hot Mess was an epic disappointment. The chicken was way too salty. There was the tasty of salty chicken, jalapenos, cheese sauce....it was such an awkward mish mash of things that did not lead to a pleasant taste. It was so unsatisfying that I had to stop and grab something to eat on the way home. Seriously.   Service was nothing to write home about either. The girl at the counter who took our orders was pleasant, but the waitress was borderline rude and argumentative. Seating was also cramped and uncomfortable. I understand it was during a busy time (Sunday, 6pm), but it was pretty claustrophobic.  These 2 dishes plus 2 small sodas ran us $29.05. So, that means the sodas had to be in the $3 to $4 neighborhood each.   Ugh. Totally not worth it.  This is definitely a \"one and done\" for me.   2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better.",

It can get crowded during peak hours so tables can be limited because the place isn't that big.

We ordered The Meltdown, Sweet Cheese Us, Naked Chix, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries. All were so delicious. Sweet Cheese Us was the perfect amount of cheesy and spicy. The NY strip steak inside was very very tasty as well. Naked Chix was the perfect meal for a kid. It came with rice and chicken cut up with a light basil sauce. Our semi picky 2 year old ate it up!

The unfortunate thing is, we have noticed a lot of our orders are usually missing an item, typically a juice or cookie. Postmates refuses to take responsibility for this and we are starting to get quite frustrated. Not sure if this is the restaurants fault or the drivers.  We made an order tonight and our \"Hangover Remedy\" juice was missing and the food was pretty mediocre compared to normal. The Blaze of Thunder, which is usually super delicious and juicy, was VERY dry. It also came with a side salad and no dressing. Very meh and so disappointing.

I asked for eggs over easy and they were. nice and runny.   Also tried some truffle fries which were pretty good.   Not all items on the menu are winners as I learned in my first few visits. I'd personally avoid the chicken and waffles all together until they change their recipe for the chicken. Way too bland.   I'm avoiding the juices in the future.

Fried pickles were yummy and the hamburger was cooked to perfection, it was homemade (not that frozen crap). The only things I would change is no sugar on top of the cookies and waitress take orders from our table instead of having to go over to the counter to order. We weren't made aware that we were suppose to order from the counter.  Besides that everything was wonderful!!!!! I will be back.",

Always delicious! Tuna tacos with mango pico, sriracha aioli and slaw. The healthy version is served in a wheat taco and the happy one is served in a puffed shell. If it's your first time getting them, I suggest one of each :)   Also got a hold of that secret menu and ordered the Fat fries. Those fat fries though... If you love garlic and cheese; you'll love em! It's their garlic truffle fries, smothered in bacon cheddar sauce. Then topped with pico and a country fried small filet on top. I thought that it was super different to see a mini steak piece fried on top of my fries. I enjoyed it!   I will be back!",

The location on Dean Martin has a warehouse feel to it.   There is a Skinny \"Healthy\" Menu (for those who are dieting and those who are health conscious about what they eat) and a Fat \"Happy\" Menu.  I love going here with friends because I'm usually that one person that is dieting or \"tries\" to eat a little more healthy that when going here I never feel bad because both me and my friends are happy. Yay! :)  I love the Ahi Sirachi Taco (3.95)- it was a light Ahi Tuna Taco over a wheat tortilla that had slaw chee, mango pico, teriyaki sauce and spicy-yo aioli sauce. The sauces are perfectly zesty, spicy and sweet. I did not feel guilty or overly full after eating two.   I also recommend the Slow Boat to China (6.95)- it is an Asian chicken salad served in a \"boat\" made of cucumber. Containing the same sauces in the Ahi Sirachi Taco- teriyaki and spicy-yo aioli sauce. Pairing both entrees would be great for a meal!",

Well, after seeing pictures of some of the 'Skinny' side of the menu, I took a chance, and was so happy to be surprised!  I ordered the Applebottom french toast and it was delicious. I seriously could not believe that it was under 400 calories! A friend ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich and also really enjoyed her 'Skinny' meal! The men in our lives (of course) ordered off the other side of the menu and liked their meals just as much. The truffle fries that I stole off my husband's plate were amazing.   We also ordered a pitcher of mimosas made with fresh squeezed orange juice. They were so, so good. If you didn't have some friends to split the mimosas with, though, it would be a bummer - they only sell them by the pitcher!   This location was pretty crowded on a Sunday afternoon, so if you're coming at that time be prepared to sit outside. The price point is also a little higher than other places in the area, but it's worth it for sure if you have people that would like to eat healthy while eating out!",

It has the express experience for food on the go and a very fun atmosphere if you want somewhere to relax and grub. As a vegan I really appreciate the menu! There are several modifiable options as well as plenty of already vegan dishes to eat. (My favorite is the naked chix, sub out chicken with Portabella mushroom and of course no cilantro sauce!) It's the perfect venue because my little ones aren't vegan, so it makes it easy for everyone in the Fam-bam to enjoy a meal together without cooking 4 dishes!  My last and favorite part of dining at SF is the service! Even before I was a regular, everyone was super amazing and friendly! They remember your name and dishes you like, they stayed aware to my vegan needs and warned me against anything not suitable for my diet! I love the staff during breakfast or dinner, they're all superb! Service is a 10, food is a 10, and even the juice bar is incredible! LOVE this place!",

Loaded with orange, lemon, basil, and carrots- light enough to drink (not heavy like a shake) and you get your vitamin C in!

My boyfriend ordered the Steak Eyes and I ordered the More Cow Bowl.   My More Cow Bowl consisted of Teriyaki Filet Mignon, Cauliflower, Portobello Mushrooms and Green Onions over Rice with Egg. The Filet Mignon was very tender and tasted delicious. The big chunks of Portobello and Cauliflower that they give you are delicious. They also don't serve too much but after you don't feel like you're stuffed.   My boyfriends Steak Eyes had country fried Filet Mignon medallions over biscuits with 2 over medium eggs and gravy. The gravy is delicious paired with the biscuits. The eggs were perfectly cooked and so was the filet mignon.   There are so many things you can try here, they also have fresh pressed juices that I also want to try.   The atmosphere is fun and energetic. Space is a little bit small for seating but luckily we were able to snag to 2 persons table.",

They are served with turkey bacon but next time we will make sure to ask for extra crispy.   Steak Eyes: they originally come with country fried filet but we opted for grilled. I love salt but this dish was so salty I couldn't take more than a bite.   Ahi Srirachi: love at first bite! Scrupulously delicious 'slaw chee' with the sweet mango pico was just too good for words.

Once in awhile I get tired of eating super healthy foods only, so when I had that \"cheat meal\" craving I had to think of a place that I knew wouldn't be my typical health-fit meal but that also wouldn't blow up my insides and have me in sheer regret later on. Best part is, I can take my hubby who hates eating healthy, knowing he will be just as satisfied.   I had the smoked bowl, chicken, veggies, brown rice and avocado served with a tasty Housemade BBQ sauce. My hubbs had the Filet O fire, absolutely amazing!!Filet Minon between toast and other goodness? Sure, why not. Don't forget their servings are rather large, grab a side of truffle fries (which are the BEST) and a warm cookie for desert. You can choose from their vegetarian and/or gluten free menu, not to mention they give you a plastic cup to reuse and recycle too! Their soda machine is their own brand with real cane sugar- it just gets better and better.",

I completely spaced on asking for her name I do apologize . I had accidently ordered to the other location and instead of just sending me away she offered to call the store on my behalf and cancel my order while getting a full refund as well as recieving the food I had originally ordered in less than 15 minutes . They are definitely setting a standard for customer service.",

    "text": "This was my first time at SkinnyFATS. I had always heard about it from others but never got the chance to eat here until last night with friends. We arrived at about 10 pm (1 hour before closing) but it was still getting a regular influx of customers.  I walked in and was greeted by friendly waitresses. You order at the front from either the healthy or happy (aka unhealthy) side, or maybe from both. Then you take a seat with your number and wait for your food to be delivered. We opted to eat at the patio since there was more privacy and heat lamps were present to keep us warm.  They also have alcohol available if you want. If you're a penny-pincher like me, then most likely you'll opt for the free cucumber water.  I got the Chicks on Broadway from the happy menu. It was a deep fried chicken breast with bacon and a green tomato along with some other garnishings. It came with a side of truffle fries.  At the patio table we were at, there was the very necessary napkin dispenser with a variety of sauces, including regular & jalapeno ketchup and chalula.  The food, decor, and experience were all very good and I had a pleasant experience here. The only reason that I can't give this place 5 stars is the prices. They're pretty high. My order cost $10, closer to $11 with tax. Despite this, I'll still be back. My visits just won't be as frequent as cheaper places.",

And theres little things here and there which I would think they should do better, but its alright.  They try to say they are a healthier option and in some aspects that might be True, but not terribly so. Also, the truffle fries were nothing compared to those you find at Bachi Burger.  Service is good and I was very impressed with them today.  I tipped extra because of the extra attention they gave to the newbie in my group.  The establishment is nice and clean which is of utmost importance to me. I would come back. It's a nice stop for a quick brunch with your sweetheart.",

Showed up at noon and were told we have not gotten to that order yet. Were also told that they would have to charge extra for the Truffle oil, which is fine, however, if you charge someone extra, at least include the item that you charge extra for.   YUP, it was not in the bag...the $3.00 oil was left out.  If this was the only item that was screwed up I would not be wasting my time, however this was the start of the problem.  The Hot Mess we ordered, was literal, it looked like they threw it together as a last resort and we asked for no onions and you guessed it...ONIONS.  The Cherry Popper that was ordered was ordered Medium was clearly Well Done at best and the over easy egg was at least over medium. Granted we will probably be back, but to order online, as we can see the person that looks over these orders does not give a crap about confirming them.  Update. Thank you so much to the great customer service/manager for making this right. Much appreciated.",

When you walk in, the set up is very relaxed, with the booth seating, the bar top seating, and the lounge feel of the patio outside. Everyone is very helpful and cheerful as well.  The food choices are very unique, SkinnyFATS basically means two different type of meals. On one side of the menu you have the Happy side, which is the food that isn't the best for your slim diet, and tastes amazing. Then you have the healthy side, which is obviously more of the leaner selection, and also tastes amazing, and the price can't be beat for the quality of the food served.   Also, they update their menu, and are very social media active for comments and feedback, to always improve to provide the best experience possible.  Very reliable place to go if you are into a relaxed place, great food that is priced well, and great service!",

Order came out in about 7 minutes and it was piping hot, after the first bite I was hooked on this place. The only downfall with my meal was that I ordered my eggs over-medium and 2 of the 3 eggs were over cooked. Servers were very friendly and helpful, I will return to try another dish. :)",

I do not have one bad thing to say about this place. The food is consistently good (both locations). We went two nights in a row because we just can't get enough. The first night we dined at this location we had the pleasure of sitting next to the parents of the executive chef. We were able to meet the chef and shake his hand to congratulate him.   Chef Josh Green is by far the sickest chef when it comes to flavor combinations. Everything we have tried has left us looking like Sally from the diner scene in When Harry met Sally. Our favorites are Tu nuts, Happymess, and chix on Broadway. We have full intentions on trying everything  on the menu.",

Thanks for the welcoming experience!",

It would have been interesting if they posted the calorie count as well, but they didn't.. I also had to resort to their online menu for pictures. The food looks amazing.. Wish they had pictures in the restaurant.   **something to think about, owners!**  Off the \"Happy Menu\" (unhealthy): We ordered the **CHEEZY PEEZY** which was extremely simple.. Flatbread with cheese and pepperoni.. But I liked it a lot.. Totally hit the spot.. It was my favorite item today actually..   We also got the **S'MOTHERLOAD** which is basically a really tasty steak breakfast burrito. The sauce that came on it was a tad spicy, and I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender and the eggs and potatoes were perfect.  Off the \"Healthy Menu\" we got the **AHI SRIRACHI**. Not because it was healthy, but I didn't like this too much. The flavors were lost on the sweetness of this item. There are diced mangoes in this taco and it completely masks the spicy.   Overall I'm really happy with this place! I'm already dying to come back to try the Chicken Waffle's among other items!  Be back soon!!",

As a busy mom of two and picky eaters in the house I needed a go-to place like this. Their menu is divided between healthy and not so healthy options ..hence the name skinny/fats. We normally order off the \"skinny\" menu and we've enjoyed everything on there. Their bowls, flatbreads and breakfast options are delicious. In addition, you feel great after eating them. Satisfying yet light!",

We got our order to go as they were closing soon.   The order came out fairly quickly. They added ketchup packets for us.   The sandwhich/burger was delicious. I thought the turkey might get dry; but the turkey patty was perfect. It wasnt tough and dry. They gave us a multigrain/wheat bun that was thick. Because it was a pretty big serving, I did not finish it and saved it for later.   I enjoyed the truffle fries as well. Because we got it to go, it was sitting in the little take out box for some time. So by the time we got home and tried the french fries, they became a little too soggy.   I wonder what meal I'll try next time. I always enjoy coming here because of the atmosphere, the vibe, the foooood and there is always friendly people.   Next time, I'll order from the happy side as to alternate the options for me! haha.",

I found this place through looking for the most reviewed place in Las Vegas and SkinnyFATS popped up very often so I decided to check it out. To my surprise, it wasn't a sit down restaurant.. you order at the front and sit down with a number and they bring out your food.   I got the Cinnutella ($8.95) which was not that great. I tried my best to finish it but I did not enjoy it all that much. My friend got the \"More Cow Bowl\" ($11.95), that was okay but it seemed like something you could find at Costco in the frozen food aisle. The meat was okay though. My other friend got the \"Filet O Fire\" with Truffle fries ($13.95). It was recommended by the cashier, thinking it was a burger... but it was a sandwich. The look of disappointment. The truffle fries was probably the best part of the meal. The sandwich barely had any filling, it was mostly all bread.   Overall, there is nothing I ate at SkinnyFats that will make me want to come back.",

Honestly could have had better flavor through a TV dinner purchased at wal mart. At least the chicken was cooked thoroughly. Don't get the hype behind this spot. I've ordered from here before and it's always been mediocre.",

I promise to try something other than the Terri Ahi. Okay, I can't promise that because the Terri Ahi is so darn good. But their fries and chicken tenders are good. Oh, as well as their chocolate chip cookie and blue berry lemon one. The prices are reasonable are not outrageous and well, the food is good. That's all I can say. Please visit a location yourself whether it's this one or the one in Downtown Summerlin.",

Everything was exceptionally prepared and in a timely manner.  The atmosphere is half between a sit down restaurant and a fast food. You start by checking the menu and ordering at the register then finding yourself a table where you place your order number for your food to be delivered. They check on you the whole time to see if you need anything as well as being you to-go boxes.  There menu is split between healthy food and happy food. But if it didn't say that most of the things on the healthy side you would know were the \"healthy choice\".  The juices were delicious as well as the ketchup choices.  I suggest checking their Yelp menu for secret menu choices before ordering.  I fully believe anything you order will be a great choice!  Myself and my hubby find this \"secret menu\" kinda ridiculous, they should just have these things on their menu.",

The staff was all very helpful when l explained my situation and I can say that I am very satisfied with my overall experience from the food, to the service, and also with their great management who reached out to me and helped me out.   08/17/15 Usually I try new things every time I come here since I haven't found one thing I particularly am fond of yet. This time I tried the bomb diggity. I was expecting a good warm sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were warm and tasted good, but the sourdough bread was  really hard. It was hard for me to eat so I was only able to finish half of the sandwich.",

Some items like the fresh juice did still seem costly, but the beef tacos are 2 for $7.95 and they are delish. I also had a beef salad that was really great too.

I love that they have the option for a \"skinny\" (healthy) menu and a \"happy\" (not as healthy) option. In addition to food they also have a juice bar you can choose from. This way you are able to decide what is best for you that day and you are able to go with others that may be looking for something different than you because of their variety of menu options.  The last time I went here was on a Sunday due to the fact that each Sunday they create a new Eggs Benedict and sundae. I love that they have weekly specials that you are able to try out. We got there just in time because after we ordered a large line started to form. The Eggs Benedict of the week was eggs with mashed potatoes and strip steak with a demi-glace and cracked pepper hollandaise. The sauces on this were incredible and I hope they have this special again! The Sunday Sundae this week was a ice cream cookie sandwich with nutella buttercream on top. I mainly wanted this because I am in love with anything Nutella and it didn't disappoint.   In addition to Sunday specials they also have many other specials you can find on their instagram or by stopping into the venue and looking at their special board next to the cash register.   I will be back for many more Sunday specials!",

There are several good deals to be had, but some may find the menu pricey for the portions. Menu includes healthy options and more standard restaurant fare, plus juices and breakfast all day.  I've had their fish tacos (both versions) before, but a healthy-side staple for me is the Nice to Greek You flatbread: plenty of toppings, good mix of flavors, portion is a big lunch or enough for leftovers later. Underwhelmed by the side of truffle fries. They're a generous portion, and crispy, but have very little flavor. I do wish they had a garlic fry option because I think they'd rock. A \"side\" of fries should be less than $3.50 and not big enough for an entire table to share, cut the portion and price to something more reasonable.  Staff are usually pretty friendly. Decor is trendy-rustic, kind of like an indoor picnic. Multiple seating areas, cool place to meet up with friends. Choose your food carefully, IMO many dishes have too much going on but there are some really solid options hidden in there.",

The truffle fries that come with these two menu items are to die for. It's got like a Parmesan cheese/basil/garlic type flavor. If I had to be extremely critical, dining area is a bit small and also I disliked that they don't have any water other than their cucumber/lemon water but that 10/10 will not stop me from coming here.

They have limited seating to begin with, and since the place is popular, it's always busy.  Very good food, again. But, I do have to be honest in saying that there have been multiple times I have opted not to come here and have gone somewhere else because I didn't want the headache of not finding a seat. Often times when you do, you're forced to sit at a table that still needs to be bussed, or if it has been bussed, goes without being wiped off.   They're just too busy to accommodate the demand both in seating and with staff help.",

    "text": "First thought was \"What kind of name is that?\" and then once I saw the menu and the name makes absolute sense - one side of the menu lists the healthy side and the other happy side; aka more fat and calories.  I wasn't feeling that hungry so I ordered one thing from each side - On the fat side I odered the Tu-Nuts which is the spicy ahi tuna with sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat with almonds, avocado aioli. On the skinny side I got the Yummus which is a rosemary hummus with carrots, celery & flatbreads.  Everything was absolutely delicious! So happy to have come here. I wish I had been hungrier so I can try more items on the menu. They need to open up some SkinnyFats in the Bay Area.",

    "text": "Skinnyfats has been hit or miss for me as far as food, but I think they've finally found their groove and after visiting their newest location on Warm Springs that boasts a larger dining area, I can finally buy in to the concept.  The location is larger than their original location but the seating is still pretty tight. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table when it's ready. I have had the turkey burger on a previous visit and found it to be a little dry and flavorless. Fast forward to this time, I actually really liked it. They seem to be taking constructive criticism and improving which has done a world of wonders.  Service was good and aside from a few hiccups everyone was very nice and helpful. If I return to Skinnyfats, I still I'll stick to this location.",

Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian. Price: For the quality and amount of food that you receive it's inexpensive. Overall Experience: Overall awesome! Great job guys!

    "text": "There food is absolutely amazing. The first time I tried SkinnyFATS was at the Dean Martin location. Yesterday, I decided to try the Warm Springs location. First, let me start off by saying it was busy. That's always a good sign in my book. I ordered the Cherry Popper burger. It was amazing. It's $12, so a bit pricey for a burger, but that included a side. My boyfriend ordered off the breakfast menu, the Smotherload, I think. That was yummy as well. My little sister got the classic burger. I can't remember if that's what it was called though... but anyways. She ate the entire thing and the fries. So, there's no way she could have gotten something from the kids menu. Haha. Our bill came to about $40 for the three of us. I would complain about the prices if the burgers didn't include fries... but they did.   My only complaint was the LONG wait to order. Seriously. We were in line forever ! There are 2 registers, but only one person was taking the orders, filling various drink orders, etc. It took absolutely FOREVER to order. I went back up to order a drink later on. There were 2 people in front of me and one at the register. I was in line for an additional 16 minutes. 16 minutes to order a drink !   But anyways, besides the busy, rush-hour, my experience was great. Th only reason I'm docking a star is because of the long ordering process. There should have been someone else taking orders. Or at the bare minimum, someone help filling the behind-the-counter drink orders (hot water, coffee, strawberry lemonade, etc).",

The asian theme burger was really wet and hard to eat, and wasn't amazing flavor wise compared to the Umami burger the dish was meant to mimic.  My date got the chicken and waffles, which were OK, but nothing special (and lets be real, chicken and waffles are kind of hard to mess up.)  The service was about what you might expect from a place like subway, with the ordering happening at a front counter, and the reception of a number.  We didn't get silverware or condiments on our table, and had to go in search of those things ourselves.  We didn't see the waitress at all, really, until we dropped the tip on the table, even though it was late and we were one of about 3 tables currently in use.  I'm a big soda fan, and they had some really good original recipe stuff on tap.  Everything from creme and orange soda to root beer and some kind of red velvet thing.  I tried and enjoyed all of them, and if there was anything that stood out it would be the soda.  The idea behind the restaurant is an interesting one, but I didn't really see the appeal.  I don't plan to come back, but I wouldn't be mad if friends were to ask me to meet them there.",

I like the fact that you can come with a variety of people and kids with different tastes and you can choose to eat healthy or \"not so healthy\" and EVERYTHING tastes great! My kids love it and beg to go all the time. My little one is obsessed with the cheese you dip the quesadilla in :-) yum! I'm obsessed with the Naked Chix and the amazing green sauce on the side... Getting hungry thinking about it. Worth trying if you haven't already... but be prepared to open your wallet and empty whats inside ;-) (ok ok... Maybe it's not THAT bad) :-)",

The service was unexpectedly amazing and both of our plates were great, we will definitely be returning back!",

I had had the fries once before and was disappointed, but thought maybe they skimped on the seasoning last time. No such luck. Some of the blandest truffle fries around again. I loved the flavors of the ahi taco, but the dish was very hard to eat. The cauliflower taco was a nice idea, but the overpowering flavor was lemon, and not much to balance it. Also hard to eat, but some of that could have been corrected with smaller chunks of cauliflower. Will go back to ordering the tu-nuts the next time I am in the area.",

I ordered a Chix on Broadway and it was fantastic.  There was probably 10 different items I wanted to try, so I'm sure I'll be back.  I also saw some of the other meals that people were getting and the food look great with nice presentation.  The atmosphere is great and the outside seating has a San Diego feel to it.  If you get a chance to go to SkinnyFats, I'm sure you will enjoy it.  The staff is very friendly and the food comes out quickly, which was nice since we were on our work lunch break.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  I just found a new favorite place to visit.",

The place is overall aesthetically pleasing, artwork all over the walls, little strings of lights in the patio seating, and amazing music playing! The staff was also very welcoming, friendly, patient since my friend and I were undecided for quite some time. We ordered the Smoke In A Bowl, Truffle Fries, and the Rosemary Jane. They were all so good! My waffle was a bit cold, maybe due to the wait for the chicken to cook but it was still tasty. The truffle fries weren't completely drenched in truffle, which made it even more enjoyable to eat. My friend really enjoyed his Smoke In A Bowl, tons of flavor and vegetables that made the dish very pleasing to eat. It was an overall great experience! We sat outside and I couldn't help but be in awe of the way it was set up. Perfect place! Thanks for the friendly service. :)",

I'm sure the person before me didn't realize it wasn't shut all the way, so when I pushed it, the door opened and I accidentally walked in on her (oops). We had chosen carry out and when we got home, I realized they forgot an item. I called the store and the person I spoke to, I believe her name was Megan, was happy to help me.

    "text": "I really wanted to LOVE SkinnyFATS the way so many friends & family do but it just didn't do it for me.  I've been there 3 times & I haven't found that one thing that really sticks out for me to keep me coming back.  The 1st time I went, I had the chicken & waffles.  It was alright.  The chicken was seasoned & fried nicely without it being overly greasy.  The waffle was fluffy but that's where I had a problem.  It was almost too soft.  I had a hard time cutting it up.  It kept tearing & falling apart.  The idea was awesome & had the waffle not been that consistency - maybe more crisp - I would've loved it.  As for a drink - I ordered a mocha.  The 1st mocha I got tasted like burnt coffee.  No chocolate flavor at all.  I asked that it be replaced.  The 2nd mocha tasted like the 1st.  I got a bit of attitude when I explained that it tasted the same & I was in a rush to go, so I didn't bother asking for a replacement.  I just drank some of their complimentary fruit/veggie infused water.  The 2nd time I went, I had the red velvet waffle.  I wanted to see if all the waffles were the same as the one with the chicken...plus it's red velvet with cream cheese frosting - who doesn't want that, right?  That would be me.  The consistency was the same.  Too soft, kept tearing apart.  Reminded me more of a shaped pancake more than a waffle.  The cream cheese frosting was good but between the frosting, the chocolate chips & the waffle itself, it was a bit much for me.  This time I ordered a straight coffee so that the mocha incident wouldn't repeat itself.  It was ok.  Your regular coffee.  Nothing exceptional about it.  This time my boyfriend actually joined me & I tried some of his food as well.  He got a wrap from the healthy side & some truffle tries.  The wrap wasn't bad but the fries were delicious!  He got a soft drink which we were both impressed by.  We liked the variety of soda flavors & that it wasn't your typical fountain selection.  The 3rd time I went, I decided to try the drunken monkey pancakes.  I figured their waffles reminded me of pancakes so maybe they exceeded in the pancake department.  They were good.  VERY sweet.  Very rich.  The bananas, marshmallows, chocolate sauce & everything on top together worked better than I thought.  I could only finish 1/2 the order because of the sweetness & I think next time, I'd ask for no marshmallows (not a huge fan).  The bacon on the side was actually my favorite part of the whole dish.  Mmm...bacon.  The service was alright. Friendly (except for the mocha issue) & fairly quick given the fact that they are always busy.  If I had one suggestion, it would be to use BOTH cash registers when you're packed.  Each time I went in, there was only 1 girl taking orders/working the registers.    I'm sure I'll end up back there at some point.  Hopefully I find something I really love otherwise it's bacon, truffle fries & fountain drinks for me. Ha.",

You have one girl and the rest is all awkward guys working there that we're giving weird looks the whole time. Sorry but when I eat I like to know that I'm not getting looked at every 5mins from them. ESP when we gave a compliment that the Benny special was very good the cook gave a weird look not happy about that. Customer service is everything and they need to work on that over there but food is amazing!!!! now I know to stick to the dean Martin location even if I'm near the warm springs location. 5 stars for food. 1 for customer service.",

The Food; Presentation, quality, and creativity 10/10 I have enjoyed several items off both sides of the menu and everything is so superb, the Ahi Tacos, The Chix On Broadway, the Monkey Pancakes, Bomb Diggity Blt, and it seems like every time I come in they have a new limited release special thats always amazing!

    "text": "To be skinny or to be fat: that is the SkinnyFATS question.   An American culinary fusion of wraps, salads, burgers and bowls, choose from one of the two parts of the menu: the healthy side, or the not so healthy side. I'll admit, I chose one of each, which my heart gratefully thanked me for but my waistline hated. Order at the counter to dine in or to-go, and wait for your stomach to enjoy.   Be forewarned: the font size of the menu is itty bitty tiny. So, if you're blind like me, remember to grab your reading glasses out of the car.   The atmosphere is welcoming with a 70s hippie, modern hipster vibe that makes your tofu bowl and brown rice fit right in like a hot dog at a baseball game. Don't worry, they'll welcome your fried ahi burger too.   They also have their beer license, which complements well with their large TV projector against the wall. Watch a sports game with some truffle fries, and appreciate the SkinnyFATS joys of life.",

I already knew that I was gonna eat off the healthy side of the menu before I stepped in, but that \"Happy\" side of the menu almost made me jump sides. Ordering was very pleasant, the girl at the register was happy and funny and helpful in choosing our meals.   We had the Greek flatbread, Banana pancakes and the goat cheese club sandwich. We shared bites, all dishes were wonderful.  :-)  Seating is a little weird. All indoor tables were taken, and I don't care for the communal high table thing, so we had to take a table on the very small and crowded outdoor patio. But it's a gorgeous day so it was perfect. Lots of self-important diners, trying look cool. Fun people watching. Sat next to a really uppity older couple. Recognized an uptight, annoying former coworker having lunch with his boyfriend. Figures. He belongs here.   We loved the food and service....will definitely be back. :-)",

The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars for now is even though the sandwich looked amazing and the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sandwich was also bland. No seasoning and other than the onions I couldn't taste much else. I'm definitely planning to go back and try some of the breakfast items and probably change my rating but for now it's 3 stars.",

I'm okay with waiting for food but it's kind of a \"quick serve\" place where you order at a counter and they bring the food out. If it was more of a sit-down restaurant environment I wouldn't mind waiting but that's not their concept so it is kind of frustrating when food takes over 20/25 minutes.

She told me there was a charge for the side of ranch. Now I don't mind, but I had never been charged for ranch any of the other times I came. She was also a little rude and asked me to pay for the ranch before she went and got it \"to save herself a trip.\" It wasn't even busy so I was a little upset she was so demanding about it. She acted like I was bothering her by asking for it. Hopefully next time I has as good of experience as my ones before this one.",

While passing though town today I worked up an appetite for a plate of chicken and waffles and I'm probably not the first to tell you that SkinnyFATS has hands down best chicken and waffles I've ever had (ever!). The waffle is light crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The chicken on top is lightly breaded, deep fried and is so juicy! It is served with a light dust of powdered sugar and a cup of maple syrup on the side. Absolutely LOVE the sweet and salty combo of this dish. I've been to both locations in Las Vegas, and are equally satisfying and great. I WILL be returning :)",

It tasted more burnt and charred then anything.  I threw half of it away.  Couldn't even bring myself to eat it and not let it go to waste.   Flat Chix & Greens- was good.  The caper vinaigrette (sooo good!) and balsamic reduction went perfectly with the salad.  I finished the whole thing.    2nd time I ordered:   Wrap Supastar-  looked really good but was also tasteless.  I had to season it with salt and pepper.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled, wish it had some flavor to it.  Luckily the cajun cliantro lime yogurt sauce was tasty so that helped.  Won't be ordering this again.   So far both my experiences has been just ok.  I would go back.  But next time I will order french toast, pancakes, or waffle.  Maybe the sweets will be better.",

I sat down and had noticed not a lot of people were waiting for food, so I expected a someone fast time for my order. As soon as I ordered, many more people came and ordered to go. A lot of them received their order who came after me. So I started to raise question on why my order was taking so long. I didn't say anything and expected my order to come out at anytime. Then I noticed more then 2 people had complained about their orders taking so long. I just waited thinking it's going to come out at any moment. I checked the time and noticed I was there for almost 35 minutes. So i asked a worker why my order was taking so long and she said she will check. I sat down and she said it would be out any minute. By that time all the other orders for to go were gone and I was left still with no food. Ten minutes went by and still my food was not out. I went up to another co-worked and asked if she can check on my food. She was very rude and gave attitude. She checked in front of her and my food was there the WHOLE TIME. She said \"oh yeah it took long because it was under the wrong name.\" I obviously got upset because if i had not gone up to her, i would still not have received my order and waited a total of 40 MINUTES for two items. I will NEVER come back to skinnyFATS again, due to the extremely long wait time for only two items, the rude customer service, and the fact that my order was under the wrong name.",

Loved the menu and concept and have been hoping I'd get to go again on a future Las Vegas trip.   So when my friends suggested it for dinner, I was stoked. I was glad to come to a second location, to see how it compared. I'm 100% still in. Come to Southern California!!   This time, I got the Caprizza - flat bread pizza with tomatoes, red onion, basil, mozzarella, and grilled chicken, drizzled with a balsamic glaze. It was amazing! Crust was the perfect blend of crispy but not overdone and slightly chewy inside. The ratio of toppings was perfect and it looked so pretty on the plate.   Hoping it isn't another year before I get to go to SkinnyFats again!",

This second location is bigger but still keeps the corky design of the original location.  I've been to Skinny Fats a handful of times. They offer healthy stuff like a fresh juice bar while offering a lot of indulgent culinary concoctions. Pick from the Healthy side or the Happy side.  This most recent visit I got a hot tea and the 'Merica. Perfectly named! As soon as the plate got dropped off I shouted, \"MERICA!\" . This dish included: two buttery biscuits topped with quality chicken fried steak, and creamy country gravy. It also came with three eggs any style. I'm still dreaming about their biscuits. They were so good!  The tea was a let down. They offer quality tea but just give you a cup of hot water to bring to your table. Refills on water are free, but hot tea should be served after steeping the tea bag. NOT A DEAL BREAKER! The tea they served was good but I think they should steep the tea for you. Just saying.   I still think they should offer a server service as the customers would be more inclined to tip the staff! Their staff is awesome and already do the work.   I recommend this place to everyone. Some other recommendations would be their chicken and waffles, all of their burgers, all of their flat breads/pizzas, and their two cucumber boats! The slow boat to China and the spicy tuna boat are both super delicious!",

Tonight I ordered delivery and my sandwiches were soaked in oil. Normally it's a nice crispy warm buttered bread. But this was falling apart it was so oily. It's disappointing when you are craving it but feel it's a gamble to order and spend the money if you don't know it's going to amazing or end up in the trash.  Edited to add.   The manger reached out to me and offered a credit. Quick customer service. I have since ordered it 4 more times with a note to to light oil and it's been on point every time.

So he asked another employee next to him what's in the citrus dressing. She goes, \"ya know, it has a citrus taste with citrus in it.\"  Wow after that I couldn't help but to burst out laughing.   She's like \"what? Is that not good enough for you?\"   I mean, no it's not good enough. That doesn't give me enough info on your dressing. After that, it just got awkward.   Anyways,  The menu is pretty big with lots of options. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and it was pretty good. It def did not feel skinny since it had butter on the bread and it being drenched with teriyaki sauce. The balsamic vinaigrette tasted like the one from trader joes.

But beyond the idea, the food is amazing! Taste, flavor, presentation- it's all there. I do wish they had some more vegan/vegetarian options for all parts of the menu but that doesn't stop me much from going back. I just typically stick to the same couple of items. The employees are welcoming and the service is quick. Overall, great vibe and even better food! I've had the avocado toast and mean bean burger. Oh and they're \"side\" of sweet potato fries... they sure don't hold out!",

Shaved New York strip, arugula, tomato, red onion and horseradish on a wheat bun. We each added a side salad the sandwich in the salad was plenty filling for both of us. I was on my best behavior so I did not lean over and taste everybody's dish but I wanted to it all look good. They have the cutest salt and pepper shakers! I may have to find out if they sell them, just found out they do. Guess I'm buying one. I will be back every time I come to Las Vegas. Looking at their menu they have things like turnip taco !naked chicken. Zucc it,This consists of zucchini noodles egg plant squash peppers mushrooms cherry tomatoes and some kind of sauce. Lots of healthy foods I could go on and on but just come try this next time you're in Las Vegas",

My favorites on the healthy side are the sandwiches because they're very flavorful, filling, and good on macros. The Cranburkey and the Steakation are my favorites since they're hearty and satisfying.   The Sweet Cheese Us and the Cherry Popper are both super delicious on the Happy Side. The cherry popper particularly is very unique and I haven't really tasted a spicy and tangy burger like it anywhere else. The fried pickles here are pretty spicy (beware) but they are very tasty.   But the best thing by far here is unanimous. The Cookies. All their cookies are to die for. If you're feeling happy one day, you need to try them",

I had the Scram Bowl with a side of sourdough toast and it was very delicious. The portions were very satisfying. Another person in the group loved her order of Morning Mac, which is what I'll try next time. They also have a lunch menu that looks fantastic! Thumbs Up!",

The cups are reusable and dishwasher friendly! I still have mine! The soda machine uses cane sugar sodas, they have flavors to put in as well.   They also have their own condiment sauces!! Pic will be included in photos. They have a different kind of sundae every Sunday and they look amazing! ( I didn't go in a Sunday and I'm not local sadly :( )   They made me a cookie with ice cream on top dessert, which was AMAZINGGGGGG!!   Will be going back when we are back in town again!",

My daughter was a little disappointed in how large the veggies were cut in the ScramBowl, but that's just personal preference. The truffle fries were to die for, as always. Service was really fast and really friendly. My only complaint: The toilet in the ladies room is not bolted to the floor. At all. I leaned a little and saw my untimely death flash before my eyes. Dying in a puddle of toilet water is not how I want to go. PLEASE FIX THE TOILET IN THE LADIES ROOM. Someone could really get seriously injured. We'll be back for sure.

Honestly, both sides of the menu would make me happy because literally everything sounded good. I ate a couple of their entrees and damn, haven't had a bad thing yet.   Their food satisfies the stomach and the soul. Burgers here are delicious and the Chickawaffadopolis is poppin'. Now don't get me started on them sweet potato fries...I have a weakness for them and the ones here hit the spot; perfect combination of sweet, salty and heavenly.

The menu is easy and pricing is reasonable, it's setup like a cafe so you order, get a number and sit your booty down.

I am so glad that i stopped eating and left my entire plate of food on the table otherwise I would be missing work and sick at home like him.  We declined the gift card to come back. This place is awful, I bet I would have had a fresher meal at the Carl's Jr right outside. --- I've been here twice before, but it was for takeout and everything was actually really good. I decided to eat in today for the first time, ordered the same thing and was so disappointed.   Our fries were cold and so was my order, the meltdown. They gave us new fries but they were just reheated older ones, they were hot, but hard.  I took a bite of my sandwich and the meat was grey, onions were cold and the cheese was not even melted.  I thought that the food was supposed to be fresh here?  We will not be returning sadly",

The place is a good size.  Bathrooms are clean.  The kitchen is clean.  The staff is friendly.  I ordered a lot and I feel like I meal prep for the week.  I never been here before so this is a dope first experience.  If you're looking for some comfort food come here.  Try the Mac-N-Cheese also.  It's the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.  I know this review is not as cool as the elites but take it from an NYC foodie.  This place is an A+ for cleanliness.  And Boomsauce ++ on my food scale.  Food is edible and messy but bomb. Restrooms are good. Table wait time none usually unless it's a holiday Take out wait time is meh. Customer service is good. Tables and chairs are comfy   * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is wack son! BS = it's just O.K.  BS+ = Yo! I like. BS++= That's Whoa! That's good. BS+++= Dayumm! That's fkn DOPE!",

That's about what we'd pay for a nice sit down place. Also the tables are almost always dirty and you're lucky if you even get one. I am a vegetarian and one time I ordered a vegetarian meal (duh) and not only were there little pieces of bacon, but also steak. I was disgusted but politely let them know so maybe they would start cleaning their grill better between meals.  BUT on a positive note; it is less crowded now that they have a new location, and the staff is always friendly and happy. I'll keep coming here for the food. It's just too good! I just wish it was a tad bit less expensive.",

The stuff on my side of the menu (fat) is so darn good, I can never bring myself to try the \"skinny\" side! Fortunately I have a skinny, health conscious wife who tends to prefer that side of the menu, which has given me opportunity to sample those items and I have to say, not bad. Actually good. Actually really good! But it still doesn't stop me from ordering from the fat side. The Meltdown is fantastic, as is the Cherry Popper, as is the Buff Chix, as is the Chickawafadopolis (chicken and waffles). As you can see I keep wandering all over the menu every time I go there because I have yet to try anything that isn't amazing! The only thing I consistently get nearly every time is the Frickles (fried pickles), because they're amazing and I'm a sucker for fried pickles.",

The tu-nuts is so unique with a blend of hawaiian style poke in a boat like cucumber stick that is well-portioned and to die for.

The skinny menu was equally as delicious and made me feel like I was cheating even though I wasn't!   The atmosphere is amazing and the staff was friendly! They even had healthy items I could feed my 2 yr old that has a horrible dairy and gluten allergy! Hands down I was impressed!  I recommend the chicken and waffles on the fatty menu! The chick with mango chuten and basil yogurt dip is amazing on the skinny menu! But seriously you can't go wrong!  The best part about this place is there is something for everyone.

I ordered a chicken sandwich no sauce. It came out with sauce, burnt. I sent it back. It came back again, no sauce, but burnt...again. What are the chances the chicken is going to be burned twice in a row? I'm talking so burnt it hurt my mouth to chew. Oh, and they burned my husband's chicken also. How do people burn fried chicken?   The ONE diet soda choice in the whole restaurant had no syrup. Told some employee about it. In the forty minutes I sat at my table, no one at the restaurant fixed it. I paid 2 bucks or whatever it was for a soda cup to fill it with water. Like, I'm already blowing my day's calories on this mediocre chicken sandwich - can't you put some damn calorie free syrup in your machine so I can drink my money's worth in soda? NO? Oh okay.   Overpriced. Oh boy is this place overpriced. Restaurant prices for a fast food type experience. Yeesh. You'd have better luck taking your money and buying one of everything at the Sonic right across the parking lot. You'd probably enjoy something at Sonic more too.  I'm giving it two stars because the food wasn't so bad that it was inedible and the inside of the restaurant was modern and hip. Never going back, however.",

Being a huge breakfast fan I am always searching for a good place to eat, that being said I won't return here. The staff was friendly but the food just didn't seem worth it for the price. I would rather go to stacks and yolks across the street or hash house a go go (my personal favorite) off Sahara.",

(and several more times a week for juice!) So far, the Healthy side of the menu is really working for me, but I can't wait to work in a few cheat days and eat on the Happy side! The atmosphere is wonderful, the upscale food is amazing and prices are super reasonable for what you get. I only have one critique...I HATE onions and there are onions in so many menu items. I was told that some can be requested to be removed, but others are mixed in. I hope we can work around this. :) See you tomorrow for a tasty juice during my morning break!",

The new location is slightly bigger too - but still has seating issues due to how busy it is :(  There is an outdoor portion but I wish it was shaded with a sheer canopy.  Our biggest advice is that their menu is really, really diverse.  There are some more typical things as well as some more adventurous dishes.  After trying a variety of different things during our repeat visits, there were things we LOVED and things we wouldn't order again.  The ahi taco is one of our repeat favorites, we've tried both the healthy side version and the happy side, and both are delicious, and prefer the healthy one since the tuna is raw & seared instead of fully cooked.  Happymess - pieces of steak, crumbled blue cheese, on a bed of fries.  Good but not great.  Smotherload - a HUGE breakfast burrito (that lives up to its name).  Good but would honestly love to have a smaller version of it on the menu too!  Chick and Waff-a-Doppolis - So simple - just chicken tenders on a waffle with syrup, but it was delicious.  One of my favorites now actually.  And lastly, not sure what the name is, but it was brown pancakes with a turkey patty in between, egg whites, and raspberry sauce - this was our least favorite and we actually didn't finish it.  Overall it was way too sour unfortunately.  Overall awesome place and once you find what you love, it's easy to get addicted.  We'll be back!",

It was on the happy side so I thought it would have been heavier. But I am not going to complain for it being a little more on the healthier side. The service was great. I was greeted with smiles and was helped with menu options seeing it was my first time. The cookies are also a must try I had the chocolate chunk and the chunks were huge. They have a healthier version of soda that was delicious. All in all in love the concept of a healthy and happy choice. Though I think it was healthy and more healthy.",

The cheese was kind of off-putting and they were a bit heavy-handed with the mushrooms (would've liked more meat), but overall, satisfying and filling.  The Meltdown $12 (patty melt) was also satisfying. No complaints.  Truffle fries were okay. Couldn't detect very much truffle oil, but I prefer the sweet potato fries over them.

A short explanation of how their menu had a \"healthy\" and \"happy\" side would have helped since it was our first time there. I honestly thought that this restaurant just served healthier versions of food that are normally high in calories, high in sodium, etc. But she didn't even care to ask. I'm a picky eater, so most of the menu did not sound great to me. However, I still wanted to give it a try, so I ordered the Buff Chix - I mean how can you go wrong with chicken tenders and fries right?   Wrong! The buffalo sauce was waaaay to salty. After the first chicken tender, I didn't want to eat anymore. The truffle fries were very soggy, tasteless and just drowning in oil. Gross! Their sodas were made with real cane sugar, but both the diet and regular cola tasted weird. I can't remember what my husband ordered, but he agreed that the food was not great.   The restaurant was clean. If you dine in, you will place your order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.   Gave it a shot, but will not be back. I can think of a lot of other places where I can eat healthier food for less money and be satisfied!",

Unfortunately, my \"skinny side\" bowl had absolutely no flavor. It was as bland as hospital food. I kid you not when I say I took two bites and threw it away. It was so bland and for almost $10, it was more white rice than anything. I could get over the portion and the price if the food \"wow-ed\" me but this was just sad. I read so many good reviews. I was just so disappointed. You shouldn't have to order the \"happy\" side to have flavor. If that's the case, they really should put a warning sign on the 'SKINNY' side.",

However, I am trying to find some other alternatives to somewhat healthier eating.  We ordered the Cherry Popper burger, which had a nice kick from the cherry/banana peppers. The truffle fries came with the burger and were way overcooked and plain as hell. The Right Stuffed was a little bit of a let down, but when I reheated it at home, it tasted better... ?  We also had an order of the Tu-Nuts, which had extremely fresh ahi. That dish had so many different flavors that tied together so well. I usually stay away from sweet potato fries because they usually taste terrible but their truffle version was fresh and not oily. I actually ordered another serving to take home.   I definitely want to come back and try some of the breakfast items and juice/smoothie options. $8 for 21oz of juice sounds like a deal to me.",

I was a little disappointed with the Pimp Shrimp, it listed them as Shrimp Tempura, however the batter is a bit thick on the shrimp and not light and airy light tempura should be. A little spicy too, but tasty. The Balls 2.0 was a taste of heaven. Kelly, who took my order described them as creamy rice balls of love and she was RIGHT. Craving them now as I write about them. I love the uniqueness of their menu and looking forward to trying something new on my next visit. They serve \"natural\" sodas, which I'm not sure if its a healthier option or just made to make you think they might be. Not a fan, but there is also tea and good ol water. Food is delicious, atmosphere is nice and service was great!",

I ordered a burger that came with two 1/4 lb. patties, two different cheeses and spicy mayo (which I requested on the side). I also added bacon and requested no bun (they didn't offer a Lettuce wrap, so I assume they don't do that?). For my side I picked the Truffle Fries based on my cashier's suggestion. I took a number and sat down. They were nice enough to package everything to-go - I ate what I could there and took the rest home.   Both the burger and fries were on the greasey side which is absolutely ok with me! The burger was juicy, simple and delicious. The fries had that great Truffle flavor, but needed a little salt in my opinion.   I also grabbed a cookie for later. It had caramel, pretzels and huge chunks of white chocolate chips. I was happy to have it at home so that I could warm it! This cookie had quite a chew to it thanks to the caramel and great Crunch from the pretzel bits.   This place was fun! I think I saw they have some kind of loaded fries? I'll have to try that next!",

For one, I had a message from a manager or employee sent to me from a previous review that they were going to have tofu added back on their menu.... no such luck. So I ordered a a full-animal-based item, some frittata sandwich thing, and wasn't too impressed. I had forgotten how much my tastebuds had also started to become adverse to eggs and bacon. In addition, got a huge order of sweet potato fries. Those were great! But I can't really make a meal on sweet potato fries alone. People say it's vegan and vegetarian friendly here, but I honestly didn't see that many options. And I didn't want to be that annoying customer holding up the line asking questions. My partner really likes this place though, so I may be trying it again on our next trip to LV.  EDIT: Turns out this location was just out of tofu, it's not that they don't serve it. I probably misheard the cashier. The manager messaged me again after this review and let me know the new menu was taking more time than anticipated to come out. She informed me of the dishes that are already available for vegans, though weren't clear on the menus yet. I really appreciate her quick response and upped a star because now I'm super pumped for when I can go back and try their vegan breakfast sandwich, among other tasty-sounding meals already available!",

I had already Yelped it (obviously) and was reallly excited to try it. My gf even drooled on my arm while looking at the pics #Truestory.   We started with the 'hot mess' appetizer which is nachos with buffalo chicken, cheese, jalapenos and sour cream. It came out with the rest of our food. They were not hot, the cheese had kind of hardened from being cold-ish and there was no jalapeno ranch, like it said on the menu.   I ordered the 'hot chix' salad. I was underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time. I felt like there were too many flavors going on between the buffalo chicken which is actually spicy, the bleu cheese, the fried jalapenos and the buffalo ranch which tastes more like chipotle ranch. I love buffalo chicken and I didn't like this one.   My friends ordered the 'meltdown' which she said was really greasy and the 'sweet cheese us' which was pretty good and the hoagie roll was soft.   My salad came out before anything and so we all sat there waiting for the rest of the order. The 3 meals with app and 2 drinks was about 60. I probably wouldn't go back except the guy next to me ordered the chicken and waffles which he said is really good. I will say the presentation of the items was good, but I felt it missed the mark on flavor.",

Have had chicken twnders, sandwiches, and a salad all have been good, some more than others. I absolutely love the fresh juices all which are delish. The prices are a little high  but the food is fresh and much better option than your yucky fast food so you definiely get what you pay for.

I usually split the difference and order from the healthy side but then add fried pickles or sweet potato fries as my side.  There is a cute little outside seating area and a large community table where strangers can sit together. They have free cucumber water. It can get really busy during lunch time and the parking is scarce. I've had to park over at the Walgreens a few times. The staff is friendly and it's always clean. I've brought 4 different friends here and they've all been jealous that this place is close to me but a long drive for them.  They have a secret menu that I noticed playing on a little TV screen or IPad next to the register. That's how I discovered the delicious frickles (fried Pickles). They're the best I've had anywhere.",

I wish the fries were a thicker cut though.  We waited literally only 5 or so mins for our food.  It didn't dawn on me to take a pic of the food but the presentations were just like pics I've seen online.   The establishment looked clean and nice. I liked the projection of the football game (on at the time) on the wall above the dining room. Made for a cool effect by using the bare wall vs putting a white screen up there.  I noticed the stools were made from what's looks like wooden palettes used for shipping cargo and topped with a padded seat of course, really nice idea.   The staff were super friendly and could see that they like working there. The cooks in the back were laughing and having a good time.  Definitely going to return and try some other menu items real soon. Great Job SkinnyFats!",

I did not appreciate the attitude. She did not even ask what I needed she just stared at me waiting for me to ask her for my food. Even the runners didn't bother asking me if I was being helped. They saw me standing there and just kept doing their business. These young employees could use some customer service pointers.",

    "text": "I must say, my dining experience left me a tad bit disappointed. I live in Southern California and have several friends that have had relatively, pleasant, sanguine dining experiences here. I've long since seen photographs of SkinnyFATS' entrees on Instagram and was intrigued enough to visit their website to get a better feel of what this place had to offer. The contradiction in the restaurant name, I found amusing, inviting. It sparked curiosity inside of me so great, across the state line I went, hungry to delve into the enigma that is \"SkinnyFats.\"   I really wanted to like to this place.  I ordered two items, one from the \"happy side\" and one from the \"healthy side.\" I had both their \"Happymess Fries\" as well as their \"Skinny Q.\" My order came to over twenty-one dollars with no beverage.   The Happy Mess Fries, I found to be particularly pitiful. The menu claimed them to be truffle fries, an item, I'm not exactly sure they are knowledgeable in its essence. The shoestring fries were topped with New York Strip streak, pico de gallo, and bleu cheese. I suppose the food delivered, as what I received were bland fries, chunks of tomato, onions, cilantro, large chunks of salty blue cheese, and a single sliced canned jalepeno at the bottom of the *hapless mess.  What the fries were missing were a sauce--something to tie it all together, as opposed to being ingredients simply mountained on top of one another. They have ketchup and Cholua conveniently situated on the table, none of which did anything to remedy the hapless situation. Give me something creamy; give me a house made sauce with my fries. (2/5 Stars)  The Chicken Flatbread was alright. There was nothing memorable about my meal. I look back and think, \"Meh, I've experienced better\", although I found it to be \"A-Ok\", which is why I am giving this dish three stars (3/5). As for tips to improve the flatbread, I'd first recommend, seasoning the chicken. Again, season the chicken. If you didn't catch it the first time, season the damn chicken. Also, it'd be nice if you shredded chicken on my flatbread, so I don't have to take mouthloads of your bland chicken to the back of my pharynx all at once. At least give diners the opportunity of masking the bland chicken with the agave barbecue and ranch you've got below. (I'm on your side here). Also, portion size; on my flatbread was perhaps a single ounce of poultry. I have no problem getting dressed in the dark to put food into my stomach, but priced at $9.50, I felt robbed. \"Where exactly did the ten dollars that I payed go towards?\", I sat bemused in thought upon receiving my meal.  (Don't worry, below I have attached photographs to document my accusations.)  Overall, a poor dining experience and last taste of Vegas. Great concept; however, poorly executed. It is simple, rudimentary food they are attempting--chicken & waffles, loaded fries, flatbreads; it is nothing revolutionary, and they are falling short on production. Don't allow your eyes to fall prey to deception; the food is mediocre at best.  Three (3/5) stars for SkinnyFATS.",

The concept is so simple yet so ingenious...to have a menu that can please those who are eating healthy and those who crave comfort food is one that many restaurants need to adapt to. On top of that, regardless if you go healthy or gluttonous, both foods are absolutely delicious!  I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the veggie burger, and we both cleaned our plates; I wish that I hadn't been talking as much while we were eating so that I could savor my food more. They have a variety of drinks from cocktails to cold-pressed juices which they serve to you in a very cute reusable cup. The restaurant itself is a bit small on the inside, but they have a nice patio seating area open when the weather is nice, the meal in its entirety was just so satisfying and I was craving the food again the very next day!",

I ordered a kids burger with fries for my 2 and 4 year old and they were able to share it.  My friend ordered the filet mignon bowl from the fat side and came with veggies and fried rice.  I tried her meal and it was delicious!  They have cucumber water which was very refreshing.   The employees were very welcoming and the food came out quickly.  I also went up to ask for a box and a container for the ranch and the young lady was kind enough to give me a fresh ranch to go.

It's a small bed of rice topped with filet mignon, peppers, onions, and a teriyaki/steak/unbelievably good sauce.

    "text": "The Skinny: decent burger for the price, the Steaknation not much as they skimp on the protein. Pass on the truffle fries(3) Service is counter service (3), Value: for $23.50 for two people for lunch given what we ordered? Meh - I've definitely had better (3)  I can't help to think that the concept of a healthy/happy side was pretty appealing for me. However when perusing the menu, from a nutrition stand point, the healthy side didn't seem so healthy to me with the exception of a smaller portion size.   After badgering the hubby to come with me, we settled on selecting what we would get. The hubs got the Steaknation ($11) off the healthy side while I settled for The Classic ($10) burger from the happy side. Coming with sides, the hubs ordered the sweet potato fries while I opted for the truffle fries.   Being curious of the Boyland cane soda fountain, we ordered a small soda which came in a pretty cute reusable cup. I heard rumors that you get a discount on your next purchased drink if you bring in the cup although there isn't anything on the website or in the store that agreed with this. Overall, the handcrafted soda fountain was kind of a miss for me. Yeah, it's made with real cane sugar but it is awfully sweet. They also featured Shangri-la brewed iced tea which tasted really watered down. The cucumber/lemon water is a nice touch though.  I thought the Classic burger itself was a solid burger. The burger was done to a perfect medium while the flavor of the SF sauce (basically a upscaled rendition of the 1000 Island Big Mac sauce) was delicious. However a few minor details kind of detracted from the experience. I didn't like the fact that they shredded the iceberg lettuce, taking away from the crispiness of the produce. The steak tomatoes were sliced too thin as well. Second minor quibble was the quality/size of the brioche bun relative to the burger patty. I thought that the bun lacked sufficient butter flavoring and was overly large for the meat. I would give this burger about a 3.5 stars overall.  The Steaknation was from the healthy side - which meant that they kind of skimped out on the meat inside the sandwich. What meat was in there was a bit dry although seasoned well. The horseradish yogurt was also a bit bland as well and rather unassuming. Definitely needed a bit more kick to it. I liked the arugula but the hubs felt it was a pass. Again, the tomatoes were too thinly sliced for my tastes.   The truffle fries were really disappointing. Soggy and without a hint of truffle oil, they were terrible. Would not recommend this option at all. The sweet potato fries fared better and I would have preferred this over the truffle fries any day of the week.  Overall, considering what they charge, I would consider this a 3 starred joint. For what you get on the happy side, it seems a bit overpriced if you think about the portion size. The burger is decent but it's not perfect either. The soda fountain options were a bust for me being too sweet and the iced tea being too watered down. Long story short, I think I'll pass on this joint. (3 starred review).",

    "text": "Been three times in my week here on business so far and it's one of my favorite places to go, but the customer service really needs to step it up!  On my first visit no one explained the menu sides and I got laughed at for asking if I \"really need two\" of the tacos, plus a side of fries and drink. On top of that, they forget my fries with my order! Granted the taco was tasty, I was peeved at the cashier for making a rude comment. A simple \" the tacos are kinda big, are you sure you'd like two?\" would have been nicer. (Hint for anyone order, order one plus a side and you'll be happy!)  The second and third time I came here wasn't by choice but because of group carpooling for business. Had the buffalo Chix (tasty and good portion size!) but fries were kinda soggy in the truffle oil. I asked for a second side of ranch for the chicken but it never came. Third time I got the healthy version of the ahi tuna taco (first time was the happy version).  And a cookie. This was also quite good, but I never got my cookie! When I asked one of the girls bringing out food about it, she took my receipt (I assume to go get it) and never returned. I went up to the cashier after I finished (about 5 min later) and she got my cookie for me finally but by then I was already annoyed that they can't get the little things right.   I'll try my luck at the other location if my group goes again but at this rate, food is winning over the crap customer service sadly. I really want to give this place 5 stars but they need to step it up in order to do that.",

I'm giving it a five star based on uniqueness and customer service. Food and price were 4.5 stars.  We walked in and a sweet teenage girl greeted us and was soooo excited it was our first time and to tell us all about how to order. Then she hands us grown ups and kids menus and then tells us about the special screen menu that was scrolling all these delish photos of their specials. I thought I knew what I wanted going in...had to rethink by having a seat.  Decided, went to counter to order and got a number - this place is deli style? COOL! We were pressed for time so it was nice to cut the wait time out.  I'm looking around at their decor... Little hipster meets American picker. Place is smaller than I imagined... But cute indeed.  Food was quick to arrive and staff kept up with chipper attitude and making sure we had everything we needed. Honestly never seen so many polite teenagers before. Kudos to manager!  As for the meal: pretty awesome, perfect portions (not too big) and great flavor. We ordered all from healthy side except pancake and cookie (guilty exceptions).  I think everything we had was in the \"wow\" category and I kept thinking... \"How is this good for me?\" Pics speak for themselves.  Note: I left feeling satisfied... Not 'sweatpants when I get home' full.  We will be back for sure!",

They just weren't very filling or tasty. I came again to try a bowl. I got the smoke in a bowl. It comes chicken, peppers, pineapple, rice, and beans. It was OK. It wasn't very flavorful and just didn't fill me. I really love the black cheery soda they have tho. So tasty! Also they have lemon and cucumber water for guest. The last time I came with some friends and ordered from the Happy side. I did get a salad, but I got the Hot Chix. OMG, bleu cheese party in my mouth. It comes with buffalo chicken, avocado, pico, fried jalapeno strips, bleu cheese and buffalo ranch. It was so good! So much great flavor and it was so filling! My friend got the spicy cauliflower and said it was so hott. She also got some kind of chicken sammich and said it was very plain and also not filling. Honestly, I need to stick to the Happy side because it makes me happy! I always see they special on Facebook and I think i need to try their cookies and sundaes. They look amazing!!! Until the next time SkinnyFATS!",

I got the cinnutella French toast and it was cooked perfectly- there was cinnamon sugar baked onto the crust, the Nutella chile sauce was perfect, it was topped with fresh fruit and it was just so amazing. I want to try everything on their menu. My friends and I weren't even talking except to compliment the food and trade bites because it was so good and needed to be savored. The ambiance of the place is also amazing. The walls are wooden and painted with bright colors. There's a sports game being projected onto a wall. There are cute signs hung up and it's really just a great place. I plan to recommend this to everybody.",

    "text": "A hidden gem that escaped me until now. After reading the reviews of the main restaurant, I decided to give this one a try. It's the closest brunch place around where I live and I pass by it every day without really realizing that it's there. It more than met my expectations and I was absolutely impressed.  The decor of the place is superb. The inside is pleasantly quirky and the outdoor seating area very comfy. The menu was very interesting, with one side called the \"healthy\" side with calorie counts, and the other side the \"happy\" side without the calorie count. Naturally I went for the happy side. I got the S'motherload and the Skinnyfats punch, but I almost ordered the steak eyes too after seeing my neighbor getting it. The Smotherload was kind of like a wet steak and eggs burrito with spicy melted cheese poured over it,  and it was absolutely fantastic. The meat was very tender, and the rest of it was very tasty. I asked the waitress what they put in the cheese and she told me it was a secret ingredient and they cannot give it out, I liked that answer because it made me crave it more  All the items in the menu had very unique names and very thoughtful combinations. It showed how much effort they put in to invent these dishes. The Skinnyfats punch was a perfect combination of all the fruits that I love, combined in somehow the perfect ratios, in seriously the best fruit punch I've ever had. It was really one of the best brunches I've had and they can count on me coming back to try practically everything on the menu",

I ended up paying $17 for my meal alone, but honestly it was worth it. Wait time took longer than we thought, though you can't blame them during the lunch rush.  The only reason I'm docking a star is because they forgot to add the bacon and avocado that I was charged for. I was so hungry that I just asked to have it on the side, and I'd put it on the burger myself.  Other than that, this was probably one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. The flavor was right on point. I'm not a a big fan of peppers but they complimented the burger so perfectly.  Glad I gave this place another try!",

I have eaten here several times and the food pure quality and has that rustic farm to table touch. Great menus for kids not to mention the specialized sodas. We were lucky enough to be the first to try their cold press cocktails. A mixture for fresh juice & booze so you don't feel like your being bad.  Try the filet o fire if you like a good meat sandwich.  Hipster are welcomed.",

    "text": "Never disappointed with a menu selection. Somehow they know how to make even the stuff I despise, taste great!!!    If you've never been here.... Here's a tip  You walk in, grab a paper menu and check it out even before standing in line to order. They have so many great things you'll have a hard time deciding on your first selection! There's a happy and a healthy side, although the happy side can also be pretty healthy. Both sides do not skip on flavor either. They've recently added a few things from their secret menu to he permanent menu, like the Filet o' fire. With your sandwiches you also get a choice of a side and my go to choice is always truffle fries, I'll go the sweet potato route if I'm being strict on my diet.   I always get a fresh pressed juice (liquid defense), but they also have soda that they make. So it's soda on the healthier side.  Also, they have infused water, if you just want a water cup.   When you dine in, your meal will be sent to your table on real serve wear and not plastic!!! They also clean the tables after you, so make sure to leave a tip!!!!",

    "text": "Wow is an understatement. This burger is the real deal. Fluffy and soft buns? Check. Huge burger? Check. Good fries? Settle down Skinnyfats, your competition is already dead    With the burger taking nearly 15 minutes to move made from an order, the quality of this place just makes it worth it.   Presentation wise Skinny Fats does it solid with every dish. I'm impressed with each dish. I may not have the best viewing angles of the foods but none of the pics can demonstrate the size of each food item. Honestly all of them are very large in portion and plenty for 1.   But onto the food taste, the most important part. This burger really shined on it. For such a large burger I wasn't expecting such a high standard but this burger nailed it. Bun was fresh and light, not too chewy while the patty was juicy and didn't spill over at ALL. IT DELIVERED.  The patty itself had me drooling and it was perfect. Flavor wise it knocked out of the park with a nice herby juice oozing out of it.   Decor is nice as well, even the outdoors when it gets 100 degrees out. Most of us were in shade so that helped.   The whole menu looked great and my friends all said they had a blast. Prices were reasonable for what you get.  I'll be back when I'm in Vegas again :)",

It was toast topped with guacamole, pesto, feta and an egg.   This visit was really good, I can only give 4 stars right now because my previous visit was the complete opposite.  Definitely going to give it another try though!",

As others have mentioned, the menu is divided into two styles of food. \"Skinny\" and \"FAT\", meaning one side has the 'healthy' options and the other is going to throw you into a food-coma (jk.. maybe).  I've passed by this place several times, but I didn't even go in until my work-recruiters invited me out to lunch. I was impressed with the menu, the combination of ingredients to make them, and ultimately the outcome of the experience.  The flavors are beautiful. The presentation is beautiful. If you're reading this far--- you're beautiful! Try anything on the menu, it can get addicting to how well their food quality is.",

    "text": "SkinnyFATS NEVER disappoints! This is one of the first spots we tried when we visited Vegas last year, and now that we're locals we will definitely be frequenting this location! We had a visitor of our own this weekend and had to show her what skinny fats was about, friendly service, an exciting menu and awesome, quality food! I absolutely love the concept of happy versus healthy because as some with stomach issues and having to be more health conscious on some days, I have the flexibility to do so while enjoying really great flavors and yet SkinnyFATS menu allows whoever I'm with to indulge without worrying about accommodating my need to have cleaner, healthier foods too. Or, then there's days like today where I was allowed to be bad and eat from the happy side! Haha   We stopped in this time for lunch and were pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to wait in line or wait for a space to sit. I initially came in with the intention of ordering the zucc it bowl but the screen up front flashed this buffalo burrito with truffle fries and I couldn't resist. Especially since the price is $4.20!! Basically it was a buffalo chicken burrito stuffed with truffle fries and served with ranch. So good. I ordered a side salad to freshen up my palate too and it was a great combination. My boyfriend ordered his favorite, a salted caramel cookie... oh, and the philly cheese type of sandwich (forgot the name, oops) but it was great. The spicy peppers were an awesome addition to the sandwich and gave it a good kick. Clearly he loves the cookies since that's always the first part of his order, but don't pass on them. Every single one we've tried has been really tasty. We always get the skinny fats punch to drink now because we're obsessed with it, but I love the sodas they have in their soda machine and how fresh they taste. Definitely a nice touch compared to classic Coke and Pepsi products.  Our friend ordered what looked like their version of a patty melt and it was perfect. She didn't say a word the whole time and we joked that she must of loved it and she admitted she did. She genuinely tried to finish it because it was so good but the size over took her (good thing, because it allowed my boyfriend and I to give it a taste and DAMN, it was good. Lol!)   As always thank you SkinnyFATS for awesome food, a great environment, nice and friendly staff and for giving us reason to return over and over.   Next time I'm stopping into that juice bar too, can't wait to check it out!",

She then marked our order as for here though we initially said to-go, she should have just asked us again. If you come here then be prepared for a long wait and mediocre service.

What's unique about this place is that they have a healthy and fatty side for whatever mood you're in for that day!  If you're into sodas they have their own brand of soda which tasted good, they had, cola, root beer, birch beer, cream soda and a lemon lime and tea!  If you're into cold press juices they have a cool place connected to it with fresh cold press juices!   The place inside was busy when we went but I did like the whole vibe they had. Almost farm style! They had great patio seating too!   The menu can get a bit pricey but the food is quality! Great service.  Super good place and I will always go there !",

    "text": "SkinnyFATS. Where do I begin with you?  First off, thank you for always fulfilling my inner fat kid. I almost always order from the happy menu (the more unhealthy menu). And I have no ragrets. Not even a single letter.  But on a more serious note. The food here is always on point. Depending on what time of day you come in, this place is usually packed and busy. The outside seating is nice during spring and summer.  I would suggest ordering any kind of burger on their happy menu. Medium rare. And throw in an extra fried egg if the burger doesn't already have it. You're welcome.  Also. They serve alcohol! Try out one of their cocktails. They're usually a fusion of something incredibly healthy, if that's what you're looking for. But the drinks taste pretty good.  The wait here may take a little longer than expected but that's because the food is made fresh and there's usually a ton of people here. Which is definitely good for business.  The staff are always kind and you are greeted right away upon entering and leaving.   SkinnyFATS is dangerously located about 5 mins away from me and it gives me even more reason to frequent this place with my hanger (not hunger).",

They are there for you when you know summer is coming and need to stay with the low calorie choices or for the days you are hungover and need to indulge in some 'happy' food. Tonight's pick consisted of the following:  Caulifire - this is amazing and although it's listed as an appetizer I can definitely eat this as a light meal. The cauliflower tasted as if it was on the barbie, the smokey taste and then tossed in buffalo sauce. The sauce that comes with it helps cool down the temp but it will definitely linger after biting into it.   Flat Chix - my honest thoughts, I didn't really care for this salad & it probably has to do with the fact I'm not a fan of capers. I did say no capers but realized the dressing had capers but didn't think it could be bad only bc a balsamic glaze was with it too. The chicken was cooked perfectly though. The problem here is that I had my mind in a salad they don't serve anymore; Kalefornia.",

I ordered the Truffle fries with the parm on the side, a veggie burger, the fried pickles and the Vegan Red velvet cake. The Red velvet cake was amazing, the veggie burger was pretty good but unfortunately the fries and the fried pickles were extremely soggy. I'm sure it was due to the steam inside the box while I drove the food home, but it was very unfortunate because they didn't taste that great. I'm not sure if there is anything that can be done to prevent something like that, while keeping the food warm but I probably wouldn't get take out from here again. At least nothing that is warm and can potentially  get soggy. The vegan red velvet cake was on point though.",

    "text": "I have been a long time patron of SkinnyFats. But after our visit this morning, I can sadly say that no more.  I ordered for breakfast, as I always do, the Steak Eyes (with my eggs over medium).    When my meal arrived, I was dismayed to see that not only had the eggs not been cooked as ordered (they came over easy), the steak medallions were considerably smaller than they usually are (think a third of the size) and the biscuits had been replaced with what appeared to me to be a cornbread muffin.  I let the staff know, and they informed me that they had just changed the menu and that the new jalapeno cornbread biscuits were now standard.  Fine, I figured, I'm open to trying new things.  But the tiny fillets were a major disappointment.  In any case, I sent my eggs back to be cooked correctly.  I waited five minutes as my companions began eating their meals.  When my food arrived, the eggs were AGAIN cooked over easy despite my explicit request that they be cooked over MEDIUM.  At this point I said \"f*** it, I'm hungry\" and ate it anyways.  I was already behind my party and decided to eat it as is.  Needless to say, this visit was deeply disappointing for a few reasons.  First of all, the recent \"menu change\" clearly translates to much smaller portion sizes (two of my companions, who have also been SkinnyFats fanatics for years, also noticed that their portions were more meager than usual on the sandwiches they ordered).  Secondly, it's clear that there is zero quality control from the kitchen.  The fact that my eggs were screwed up not once, but TWICE, was frustrating to say the least.    At the end of the day, I'm bummed that one of my favorite local eats has let itself go by forgetting the formula of customer service and quality that made me fall in love with it in the first place!  RIP SkinnyFats.  You will be missed.",

With 2 sides to the menu (happy or healthy), even your picky eaters can find something they'd eat.   I went here with a friend; he had a flatbread, and I had the chix on Broadway with truffle fries. The fries were cooked well, and they were salted just right with a subtle truffle flavor, I'd give it an A. The sandwich was flavorful with the mixture of aioli, cheese, and bacon amongst some of the toppings. The only criticism I'd have is that the chicken by itself is somewhat bland, but the combination of flavors when eaten together was delightful.  There was a line when ordering, so we felt somewhat rushed, but the staff was kind overall and laid back. The aesthetics definitely had a hipster/urban vibe, which paired great with the flow of the menu offered.  I will probably be back again to try more items on the menu.",

It's pretty cool that you can get a healthy, gluten-free or vegan version of a sandwich, or get the happy version with cheese and bacon if you're feeling that. Even the \"unhealthy\" version of some of their menu is probably better than any fast food or sandwich place. Plus the menu is broken down into types of food in an interesting way so you can get anything from soup to tacos, but they don't have too many choices, it's all engineered pretty well. I normally get the teriyahi sandwich, which seems pretty healthy and is very good. I've tried the blazing chicken sandwich, which was excellent too. The sweet potato fries are tops, but if I take them to go I usually pop them in the oven for a few minutes to reheat and crisp them up, after which they're amazing. I like that they're local to NV and I'm not feeding a huge corporate chain business with my $$$. Whatever you're in the mood for, SF probably has something to offer.",

On our way out we got a friendly \"thank you\" and a helpful tip to bring my 32 ounce juice cup back for .50 off my next juice.   I had the Green Mile (basically the juice of a ton of green veggies like cucumber, spinach and kale) and an Adobo Hobo. My husband had the Bleu Balsamic salad. He didn't realize that it came with steak so he ordered grilled chicken. It came out with both and that was okay because the salad was delicious and big enough for me to have a few bites.   The Adobo Hobo is tangy yummy vegetarian goodness on a whole wheat tortilla. The Green Mile juice was just what I wanted - not sweet at all and full of green goodness.  Maybe one day I will try the \"fats\" side of the menu, but it feels so good to eat well. And SkinnyFATS makes that easy to do!",

Other than that, the ingredients were fresh and the bread was very tasty. My bf ordered another burger (don't remember the name but it had steak) with a side if sweet potato fries, and those were delicious! Highly recommend ordering them.  As a vegan costumer, I really appreciate that they have plenty of options and it's very easy to spot those vegan options as they're marked with VG on the menu.   They serve breakfast all day, juices (not sure if they're cold pressed though) and coffee. And lemon-cucumber water is free! Service was good and everything was clean.",

    "text": "*military discount*   Short version:  Overhyped, espensive, not worth it.    Long version:   Went on Sunday 10-11-15 around 12:30 PM.  No line at all so we ordered right away at the counter. $26.84 got me a regular size Mr. Green juice, a \"Sweet Cheese Us\" sandwich, and the \"Brussel Crowe\". No high chair was offered for my kiddo so I held him in my lap.  Not sure if they have them or not.    After trying one of their yummy juices at the last yelp event I figured they were all that tasty so I ordered up a \"Mr. Green\" which is comprised of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine, celery, cucumber & apple.  At $9 it is definitely the most expensive non-alcoholic liquid I've ever had in my mouth. One sip had me re-thinking my decision and contemplating taking it back.  It was watery and terrible. I decided it was probably just my personal tastes and dumped my expensive-ass juice down the drain and refilled it with some Boylan ginger ale.  What a waste.   The \"Sweet Cheese Us\" was listed on the menu as shaved NY Strip, cherry/banana peppers, caramelized onions, portobello, pepper jack & cheddar sauce on a hoagie w/side.  I chose sweet potato fries as my side.  If this sandwich was on the healthy side I would have been impressed.  It was too big and sloppy to fit in my mouth so I ended up eating it with a fork.  Bland strips of steak and portobello topped with the most bizarre cheese sauce I've ever seen.  Somehow it managed to be grainy and runny at the same time.  While I appreciate the effort to be more natural than the neon yellow stuff from a can, I would definitely pass on this one next time.  Sweet potato fries were really good, though, and that jalapeno ketchup is nothing short of genius.    The \"Brussel Crowe\" was my most anticipated dish of the day.  I love brussel sprouts!! The menu described it as brussel sprouts w/marinara, basil, provolone & pepperoni.  Like brussel pizza! It would have been awesome if the sprouts weren't completely raw.  Trying to masticate them bad boys was tiring.  I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be or not but I definitely wouldn't order this again.    If I ever go back I'll definitely get breakfast.  From reading the other reviews they seem to be the tastier items.",

Generally, there is a line around the corner on most lunch days, which is a testament to the quality of the food.  What I like the most about this place is their creative use of sauces. Instead of high-calories mayonnaise based sauces, they use homemade yogurt based sauces. This lowers the calorie count by a lot and makes it a much more light meal. Unfortunately, I cannot go to this location very often because of the wait to get in around lunch time.  If they were in a better location and had a larger facility, I would give this five stars for the food and staff.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying, I love Skinny Fats. It is definitely one of those places you have to visit before you truly understand the high reviews this place receives. My mother raved about this place for months before I made it in for the first time. The quality of the food is outstanding and each menu item is unique.   I would give this place 5 stars but there was this one incident...  I was waiting for my to-go food and happened to overhear an order taking place. One customer asked the employee what \"GF\" meant on the menu. The employee told the customer that it meant Gluten Free. But the real kicker was when the customer asked what gluten free was, the employee had NO idea.  I'll admit that I did stand there chuckling at first, later I realized how embarrassing this really was. I almost jumped in and answered for her, but I saved her the embarrassment and let the customer order it anyways.  Granted, gluten free is not as common as lets say, sugar free. Employees should still know what the menu items are/mean.   Other than that, I recommend this place to everyone. For all of you yelp readers out there, here are a few general tips that I wish I knew from the start..  Tip #1: If you are ordering the sandwiches, eat there. Taking them to-go is not the best idea. The bread can be soggy, but nonetheless the food is still enjoyable.   Tip #2: At least half the time your side should be the Slaw Chee. Absolutely fantastic.   Tip #3: If you are ordering to-go, call and find out what the specials are. There are plenty of items that are not on the general menu that are available to order.   Tip #4: If you do order to-go, you can skip the line of people waiting to order. This line can be very unappealing and somewhat frustrating as you stand there and listen to all the little questions each customer has. Simply walk up to the front and say you have an order to go. I was told to do this, so I assume it is a common understanding among the employees and customers.",

This place is awesome for starters because they split their menu into 2 portions, one side is for healthy food and the other side is dedicated to making delicious food. Kind of makes you feel guilty about ordering from the delicious side lol but both sides are good nonetheless. The service there is excellent as everyone seems to be genuinely happy and want to help you out, was recommended the Cherry popper burger and it was ridiculously delicious, rivals an old fashioned in n out burger! Also had the naked chix, which was a healthy chicken bowl and that was pretty tasty as well!",

Both of which were nothing short of delicious (and very filling). Pretty much everything on the menu looks tasty, and I have set a goal to try it all. Service has always been warm and inviting.

I decided on the tu nuts, truffle fries, and a drink. My total was $16!! I like that you get to keep the cups, and if you bring them back on your next visit you get $0.50 off your next drink.  Inside seating was full, but luckily the weather was gorgeous so we sat outside. The food came out quickly, considering how busy they were. The tu nuts was good, but it was not filling. The fries were just okay. Not really truffle-ly.  I tried the sweet potato fries and they were good, I will get them next time. Honestly I was still hungry after eating. Next time I would probably order a sandwich or something more filling.  Yelp 2015 Review #30",

The decor is nice, they have a communal table and outdoor seating as well. Since this was my first time, I stepped off to the side and reviewed the menu for about 10 minutes until I finally settled on what I wanted to eat. I went with the Happy Mess which are truffle fries with shaved NY strip steak, bleu cheese, and pico de gallo. Drinks are self-served and they have a variety of different fountain drinks, some that I had never even heard off. I was impressed with that.   After ordering, I received my food after about 10 minutes. The fries looked good, and tasted somewhat good. They were too bland for my liking and not very filling. After finishing my fries I still felt hungry so I drove over to Ohana across the street for my second dinner. Maybe I should have ordered something else, maybe I eat a bit too much, but I left unsatisfied, they do have great service though. I'll try eating here again in the near future since they're only down the street from me.",

Studied the menu and the found out at the cash register that there is a \"secret\" menu... it's posted online. Definitely check that out!!!! My friend and I both ordered the shrimp tacos and an order of the Frickles. The Frickles were delicious fried pickles. The shrimp tacos were also spicy delicious! This place is no joke with the sauces and spice, so if you are sensitive, I suggest getting all your sauces on the side. My next visit, I'll be more prepared and will have studied the \"secret menu\" online.",

The picture looked so good and to die for on yelp so I ordered it. But as soon as I took that first bite. I didn't like it at all. Personally, it just doesn't go together on a flat bread. Thanks but no thanks, I'll stick to my greek salad. I also ordered the truffle fries and if you know me... I LOVE FRIES!!! But these fries were like really soggy and oily. Whyyyyyy???!!!? ): (In a whiny baby voice) and my chai tea... What the?? It was horrible! And I love chai tea. My chai tasted like water with a small tiny hint of chai flavor. Barely even there.   Everyone I know raved so much on this place so I got high hopes. Ended up being disappointed big time. I gave it three stars because my little brother ordered this burrito and it was tasty. I was going to order his but I didn't feel like spending more money because I wasted my food. I'm glad my little twin brothers enjoyed their food. But mine was just Bleh. I will come back to try something different though.",

There is always something new to try (that you probably have never had) and if you have had it all they are always coming out with new specials.   The customer service here is also fantastic. The atmosphere is really mellow. Mostly EDM music, but not so loud that you can't talk to a friend or date.   Inside they offer both table seating and a type of bar seating around a large high table. They also have one giant screen TV and one projected TV, typically showing sports. They offer outside seating as well under nice string garden lighting.   I would recommend this place to anyone. They do have another location which I have been to. however, the atmosphere does not compare. This location is highly recommended for your first time!",

The food came out and the server was pleasant, the presentation was amazing and the taste was fabulous!!

    "text": "This place is an absolute overload. The restaurant interior has a LOT going on (in a good way) so it's quite an experience to soak it all in while trying to decide what to order for the first time. What kind of restaurant blatantly separates healthy from happy foods? Bonus points that this is their defining factor. You actually consciously make a decision whether to eat healthy or happy.  Of course it was my first time, so I had to go all-out. I decided to pop my Cherry Popper burger cherry with the Cherry Popper burger. $12 for a half pound of beef with cherry/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack, and a fried egg on a Hawaiian roll. The bottom bun was completely soaked by the time I got my burger, but it was sturdy while I ate it. Messy messy messy, but sooo worth it. For those who like spicy burgers, Cherry Popper is the one for you. Half pound is actually quite a lot of meat for the average person... or maybe I just have a small stomach. No regrets about the Cherry Popper. Hands down, hit the spot.  Anyways, I got my burger with a side of their Truffle Fries, which I am not a huge fan of. They were a bit overcooked, but they did taste like truffle oil. Kinda wish I went with the Sweet Potato Fries. Love all the other creative and tasty sounding options on the menu. I will be back for more!",

We of course tried the skinny(unhappy) side. It was delicuous if I had a personal chef from Skinny fats preparing my healthy meals on a daily I might be in a better place! Lol but the environment is awesome, relaxing with lots of friendly cheerful staff. Even children were in there enjoying juice drinks and the cookies that looked delicious that my friend didn't allow me to have.

    "text": "I have never been accused of being \"hip\". In fact, having used the word hip in a sentence probably indicates how far off I am. But I've been around long enough to know that our attention starved society thrives on the mindless pursuit of trendy behavior that leap-frogs from fad to fad in a desperate attempt to stay relevant in a culture where being odd is more highly valued than being - well, just about anything else.  Traditionally, this type of pursuit has never served the restaurant industry well. Most attempts to shake up the culinary comforts of the nation as a whole have failed with spectacular results. Even those few dubiously places who manage to grab the attention of the culinary media, with a spotlight on some cable food program, usually end up falling out of fashion as fast as they rose into it.   Trying to be different in the culinary scene is never as successful as trying to be better. There is a reason places like Franklin Barbecue in Austin Texas have people standing in line for hours every single day, they serve better barbeque than anyone else - in a place that saturated with barbeque. You could try and recreate barbeque in Texas - I mean, it's a stupid idea, but you could try. You might even get Guy Fieri to stop by on his road show, or have Adam Richman try to inhale 20 lbs of Macedon brisket in 15 minutes. If you do, chances are you will have massive success in your new stupid adventure (for a short time at least). But after your 15 minutes of culinary fame have ended and Guy no longer answers your phone calls, what you'll be left with is a small but dedicated troupe of regulars that can't afford to keep your stupid alternative barbeque restaurant in business.  Trendy but doomed restaurants are usually very easy to spot. Take for example this place called SkinnyFATS. See what they did there? Clever huh? They took skinny AND fat, and put them together in one place - - hash-tag: mind-blown - POW!   I wish I could explain to you how SkinnyFATS dichotomy of culinary concepts works, how the fat and the skinny are magically brought together in one revolutionary concept, but - well, I have no idea. And from the looks on the faces of everyone else standing in line, they didn't know either.  You see, SkinnyFATS fancies themselves as being on the leading edge of cool, hip, trendy (whatever you want to call it) culinary fashion. So much so, that their menu is a clusterf**k of confusion - \"I mean a literal clusterf**k of confusion.\" You see the name of the menu item, and read through the entire description under of its ingredients, and you still have no idea that they are talking about a stupid burger. I wasted an ungodly amount of time on the skinny side of the menu, and didn't figure a single thing out. In fact, the only thing I am sure SkinnyFATS has on their menu is a burger with cherry peppers, because that's what I ordered (of course, I had to confirm it was a burger first).  Now listen, the burger was really good! I mean it, I enjoyed it immensely. I will probably go back at some point, although I am not certain I will ever order anything else off the menu, just for fear of having an aneurysm trying to discover what it really is.  As for the trendiest of trendy culinary fashions on their menu, the truffle fries - well, they just plain suck. I mean it, stay away!  It's not real truffle oil, it's not made from truffles at all. It's a nasty chemical concoction that is made from petroleum and some cheap oil, and it tastes like crap. The fact that a single gram of truffle costs around $26 should alert you to how obviously fake these fries are.  The staff appear to be enjoying their time as the cool kids on the block, they have an air of superiority that is well deserved, since they are most likely the only people who know how to translate the menu. Don't get me wrong, they are the \"friendly\" cool kinds on the block - they're not likely to pull your shorts down to your ankles and laugh at you, but their collective indifference is plastered across their faces. Usually this type of unfriendly customer service is a result of being forced to labor for less than a living wage under greedy owners, but I'm only guessing - maybe young people just hate work all together.   I am not disappointed in SkinnyFATS, in fact I appreciate the fact that they have chosen a moniker that is the culinary equivalent of a book with a picture on the cover of a muscular man (with long flowing hair) holding a woman (with a 12 inch waistline) in his arms - it pretty much sums up what's inside.",

I'm  not a fan of beets which a lot of their shakes and juices have in it. You can ask for them not to be in them but I just prefer to order the drinks without them. If u walk in to order drinks or take out, expect to wait as food and drinks are made to order. Also it does get really  busy so tables could get sparse. They have a nice outside location but just make sure to bring a jacket in the winter months. Everyone is friendly and will welcome you when you walk in the door.

The interior is very unique with paintings all over the walls with quirky quotes and the whole place just had a very urban industrial-esque feel to it. Upon one glance at the menu, i could not hold my giggles in because all of the items have very funny and puntastic names.  I finally decided on the \"cherry popper\" and my friend had the \"#America\". They were botj delicious! The cherry popper was a burger on a hawaiian bun with hot and sweet peppers and a bunch of other things i cannot remember anymore. But i just remember it being so good, especially with the truffle fries on the side. Delicious!  But the star of SkinnyFATS has to be their soda bar. You will NOT find your typical sprite, coca cola, neste raspberry iced tea here. They have a soda bar full of old fashioned root beer, cola, orange soda, ginger beer, etc. My favorite was the cream soda! I filled my cup 3 times and my tummy was so full from soda that my friend ate half my burger! (The re-usable cups are a cute and environmentally friendly touch as well!)  All in all, this place was a really great experience all around and I cannot wait to try other quirky items on the menu!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times, usually getting the chicken parm sandwich with truffle fries which is always really good, but today I came in for breakfast and ordered the cinnutella breakfast with a side of bacon and wow. This is definitely the best thing I've had here, if not one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. It was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The chili Nutella sauce wasn't spicy or overly chocolaty, and it was balanced nicely with the berries (strawberries, raspberries and blackberries). You would think this breakfast would be overly sweet with the cinnamon sugar outside and the Nutella chili sauce but it wasn't at all, and perfect with the bacon. The bacon was nice and thick cut and cooked to perfection. Their coffee is also really tasty and affordable at $2. I plan on coming here more often for breakfast since I live five minutes away!",

It's just greasy and buttery enough to fulfill a craving but not overwhelming to the point you regret eating it.  The workers taking phone orders are always nice and have the orders ready to go in the stated pick-up time.   Someday we might actually dine in.",

That's what makes this place so great for me. They have a menu to please. The left side of the menu is full of healthy options, including whole wheat protein waffles with rosemary chicken and sugar free syrup, while the right side is the \"happy\" menu that has a richer version (fried chicken and waffles with maple syrup).  Don't come here if you're looking to have a soda with your meal, cause they don't carry any soda products. They have cold pressed juice (a little pricey but so good) and they have milk shakes.  I had the Drunken Monkey Cakes which came with glazed bananas, whipped cream, marshmallows and chocolate chips with a side of bacon. So delicious...",

    "text": "skinnyFATS. i don't know how to describe this eatery except that it is a wondrous, best of both worlds restaurant that executes their dichotomies so perfectly. i mean, the name speaks for itself, but it's a best of both worlds place in other ways too:  - great ambiance for eating IN, but its quick, made-to-order flow makes it a superior option for taking OUT.  - ideal for eating INDOORS, but there's also a beautiful patio if you want to eat OUTDOORS.  then there's the food part.  there are two sections on the menu, a 'HEALTHY' / SKINNY side and an 'EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPY' / FAT side, which contains the more caloric/indulgent entrees. seriously, each item on the menu sounds delicious and aligns so well with its respective section.  okay, and here's the real reason why i love this place:  they have my favorite beer (delirium), which is actually the only beer they have in stock (or from what i saw) AND they serve smoothies (my favorite beverage of choice). there's no way. NO WAY.  having stuffed myself to the brim during my trip in vegas, i opted out of the bottle of delirium and decided to go the healthy route by ordering the popeyes delight smoothie and the TBLT sandwich. the popeyes smoothie, which was blended with spinach, orange, strawberries, apples, FF yogurt and ice, was AMAZING. the turkey bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich was well-made and came toasted on a multi-grain bread slices. also comes with a free side. i cheated and got the truffle fries. it was heavenly.   only if this spot existed in NYC - think people would go nuts.",

The menu is filled with so much to chose from but i went with the \"Happy\" side and picked the Sweet Cheese Us it was a very delicious philly type cheese steak and i got the side of sweet potato fries to go along with it because those fries make the truffle fries look and taste sad! The only down part of this sandwhich was the top cheese sauce was cold and tasted alot like clumpy velveeta cheese but nonetheless still delicious!

    "text": "I've been to Skinny Fats several times over both locations & have loved it every time. Normally I get the Ahi Taco San & Slow Boat to China but after seeing the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRaspBomb.com&s=83fd44f76a8a03746d6e5e763e2dc79756658bd08fd1efc7a6677cef9dfd35a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">RaspBomb.com</a> on their FB page I decided to order that up with the truffle fries ($12.97). I was highly disappointed. There was no raspberry taste what-so-ever to the sandwich even though the bread appeared to have raspberry swirled throughout it. It tasted just like a grilled chicken sandwich with alfalfa sprouts. I asked for alfalfa sprouts after the sandwich came since I forgot to ask when I ordered. Truffle fries were disappointing as well. No flavor although they said there was truffle oil on the fries. There was no salt as I added that myself. I wished I would have gotten the sweet potato fries one of my lunch mates had. I hate ketchup (gasp! I know the absurdity of that) so I asked for ranch from one of the servers & even after I said I don't use ketchup she told me there was a 50 cent charge for ranch. Seriously? I am not using both - but using ranch in place of ketchup. I would have thought they would have told me they were charging for alfalfa sprouts instead of ranch since alfalfa sprouts would be a higher cost to them. I told them to forget it. I tried the fries with the Jalapeno ketchup that was on the table. ICK. Sad to say today wasn't that great of an experience at Skinny Fats.",

I stumbled upon this place, and after looking through the photos and menu, decided to make a quick stop. Upon arrival, I was delighted by the concept--cool and quirky...aaand the ultimate hipster attraction. It's set up for guests to order at the front (at the time, the line looked long, but it was deceiving and rolled by quickly). I sat and waited a good 10 minutes for my food with my yummy Summer Quencher juice (points). As for my food...I ordered the Smoke in a Bowl from the \"healthy side\". I could tell it wasn't exactly healthy; it felt heavy and greasy compared to all the very clean food I ate this week. It wasn't the prettiest site either, but everybody else's food looked decent, and they raved about their dishes upon first bite (TBLT and ahi tacos).",

    "text": "I come here often and the last couple times I have come in to get food before a going to work. One of those times the line is out to the door and they only have one girl on the register. Everyone else is kinda just moseying around. One girl is slowly doing roll ups, I see a couple employees walk past the register and no one ever acknowledges there's a line. I wait about 25 mins IN LINE to order food. It was honestly one of the most aggravating me experiences when it's clear that another employee should be in the register too, it's busy enough! Then I wait for 20-25 minutes for CHICKEN TENDERS AND FRIES. At one point I was like I'm sorry I didn't realize it would take this long for food. And I'm like I have to go. Just cancel my order. And the girl working as the expeditor says it'll be up in just a minute. Well I came an hour before work and I have no food so I have to go. The next time I called in my order, thinking it would be faster. They don't give me any instructions on how or where to pick up my food. So I obviously stand in line and wait to get to the register. I'm in like for 15 MINS and I see people just going right up to the counter and picking up food/paying!!! So as I'm standing in line I flag down an employee and tell her I have ordered food to go and I need to pay. She brings out the food and points to the register and was like she will ring you up. I was like well I have to go, I thought about just leaving the food bc I really did not want to waste my time. The girl, Nichole I think her name is, ends up taking my payment. I've never not tipped them but I did not tip this time bc I was so peeved. The food is good but it takes too long to order and if you order to go it seems to be an issue. I really don't know if I'd come back. I've talked to a couple of my friends and they all had the same reactions about this location, IT TAKES FOREVER.",

Cramped restaurant that seemed to focus more on atmosphere than anything else. Needless to say it took a while before we finally made it to the Warm Springs location to try the good out.   Definitely worth the wait!  I had the Cranburkey and my husband had the classic. Both were incredible, but the fries left something to be desired. The sweet potato and regular fries were both undercooked.   The French fry disaster was a shame but not enough to keep us from visiting again.",

Our food (and this happens every time I go with my wife) will be sitting on the counter for 10 minutes getting cold, we timed it this time. We always watch our food just sit there , and when we get our food: it's cold, bread is soggy, and it really ruins the meal.   One of the servers there (Stephanie) was extremely rude. It is 3pm and there are only 5 tables occupied, it is not busy at all. When Stephanie brought us our soggy cold food, she did not ask who's food was who's, she just set it down like she couldn't leave fast enough and snatched the number off our table. And to make things worse, she grabbed utensils and literally tossed them on the table half behind her back since before she could even bother to properly set them down she was already in a hurry to walk away. She didn't even look at us and yet our food was the last order, and new guests hadn't even walked in yet when she walked away so we aren't sure what she had to do that was so important that it became okay for her to just toss our silverware across our table.",

It took me a while to get it, but looks like the general idea of the place is that you have a healthy menu for items easier on your tastebuds and a happy menu for those who want more heartier and savory things (hence the name SkinnyFATS). Very convenient for those who want something a little less taxing on their tastebuds and also want to stay fit!  I was also very impressed by the selection of their menus - I came in, worrying it was solely a burger place, but they also have salads, fresh juices, breakfast items and desserts as well. They have such a good range of items that can fit everyone in a group. I can't wait till I get to come back again!",

After talking to my Elite CM Nate, he gave me some good advice \"don't post a review after the first visit and just because you had a bad experience - give them a second chance because everybody can have a bad day\" and he's right. My first visit here the Strawberry Lemonade was terrible but after I left my review and I returned, it was perfect! So I made the decision to delete those previous reviews and write a fresh new one after I've returned multiple times as I do love giving second chances, so here it goes!   Skinny Fats has a great environment, even when they are busy an employee always says hello and welcome as you enter. There are times where the line is a bit of a wait but the food is so worth it! At this location online ordering is not available which is a bummer if you're looking for convenience but you can call it in ahead of time and pick it up for to-go! I've had a few things off both sides of the menu and surprisingly enough I've only enjoyed the meals I've had from the Healthy side so far. I did try their ColdExpress \"juice bar\" as well and for $10 I was still hungry afterwards which was disappointing but that just proves I'm not a juicing person but at least I tried! They have a secret menu on their iPad and sometimes share the items on Facebook which is fun, I love the Secret Punch drink! So my point is, give this place a try! And don't leave a review without experiencing it more than once is great advice.",

Portions are great, taste is mostly there, associates are usually always smiling, and it always busy. Like always busy. So busy there is always a line to order food and almost always nowhere to sit. Now, I can't knock a restaurant for being busy but I can did the food quality. I feel for the dollar being spent you could go have a great brunch on the strip, in a casino, at any \"healthy\" food spot. Yes the orange juice is amaze-balls and their truffle fries are some of the best.... but I can say their waffle on the chicken and waffles is one of the worst. I'll continue to come to skinny fats; it's close to my house. And I'm sure I'll continue to be pleasantly surprised or obviously disappointed.",

    "text": "This place is definitely for all my ladies and gentlemen out there who are \"skinny fat.\"  You know the type I'm talking about... You love food and don't know what you would do without it, but hate the extra pounds it adds to your amazing physique.  Yeah, this place is golden for you.   You walk in and are greeted with enthusiasm from the staff that works there. The decor is bright and cheery and one of the walls even boasts, \"live happy.\" I can't imagine not being happy when walking into this place. The menu can be a little overwhelming because it is quite jam packed, but make sure to read it through before placing your order. You don't wanna order something in a rush and miss something you could really love.  I ended up going with the Chickawaffadopolis (basically chicken and waffles). It was AMAZING. The chicken strips were perfectly crispy and the waffle was delicious. My friend got the Cranburkey with a side of truffle fries. I stole some of her truffle fries and they might be some of the best I've had here in town.   I also went with one of their coldpressed juices: the Summer Quench (cucumber, celery, Apple, and lemon) and it was great!! I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again.   I think what I honestly enjoyed the most was the friendly atmosphere the staff treated the guests with. The person at the counter was amazing and super helpful since it was our first time. I will definitely be going back again soon!",

Eat healthy or eat bad - I went with the bad but got a healthy juice to counteract it..=P    I got the chicken & waffles, which I thought was okay.  They used chicken tenders instead of bone-in chicken.  The chicken tender was a nice twist, but I prefer the chicken in bone for the juiciness.    We also ordered the truffle fries.  So, why the 2 star?  Well, one of my pet peeves is that the food should come out hot.  The food we got was luke warm to warm only.  It was like it was sitting out for awhile.  The fries came out first and it was luke warm, so maybe it was just the fries - NOPE.  Our meal came out and it was warm too.. Not a good sign.  they need to get the food out quicker to the customers or invest in some heat lamps to keep it hot.  I mean I like the concept, just need a better execution in bringing the food out hot.",

Any who l have to let it be known that this SkinnyFats happens to be one of my favorite neighborhood places to eat! I really love the fact that they have this whole thing going on like one side of the menu is \"fat\" and the other side is \"skinny\"  It almost makes you second guess yourself on which side you want to eat on lol. Either way I can honestly say that you can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu! I have almost tried every option they offer and have been extremely impressed with everything! I also would like to mention that they usually offer these weekly deals of different dishes that aren't on the menu! The Slow boat to china and any of the Ahi tacos are my favorite! I can eat them almost everyday! Also I recommend trying any of the cold pressed juices they offer as well!",

With such a great concept having 2 sides to the menu (Healthy vs. Happy), you cannot go wrong and there is a dish for just about everyone!  Everything I've had so far at skinny fats is delicious.  I get overwhelmed each time that I'm at skinny fats because I can never make a decision! everything on the menu looks so tempting!  Their \"Slow boat to china\" and their \"Ahi Srirachi\" has a similar taste, both AMAZING! I love their \"Stuffed Right\" pepper as well as their waffle dishes. I did order their Benny Special this past weekend and it was to die for! They always have specials that are not broadcasted on their menu, but rather on their social media pages.  You would have to follow them in order to see what the special of the day is!  Also, their pressed juice? So fresh and so yummy!  I love the decor in skinny fats also.  Very laid back and modern. Staff is always so friendly and quick to attend to your needs regaurdless of how busy that are (and they are always busy).   I highly recommend skinny fats!",

I liked that the soda machine was not your typical pepsi or coca cola but it was a different brand, very cool! Well the ordering process is very easy, do you want to be a fat ass or are you counting calories? I opted for the healthy/skinny options and ordered the bare chicken with the side of slaw chee because the cashier lady told me it was similar to kimchee and I go nuts for that stuff.   The portion of my chicken entree was pretty good, I did not feel stuffed at all, maybe that's because it was part of the healthy options. It comes with a mango sauce which was pretty good with the chicken and the brown rice but I also came with some kind of cilantro dressing which I had no clue what it was for, it tasted very good but it didn't really mesh with the meal.   I would describe the slaw chee as coleslaw with a bunch of random dressing, it was just alright.   I think I need to go back and try their fat meals. I follow them on instagram and all their posts look delicious. This is a fun little restaurant but the food was just okay. Oh and the service was very friendly.",

I have never seen a restaurant doing such a great job with the pictures of their food and social media......these guys know what's up.....they have created a hip restaurant at affordable prices......",

The menu is extensive(healthy menu & tastier menu) with a lot of details, it's probably best to know exactly what you want so you don't hold up a line. I ordered the chicken and waffles (chick-waffa-dop-lis). We sat down and it was packed(Sunday afternoon) but we managed to get a seat indoors. There was an outside portion but the seats were taken. I received my ordered after about 10-15 minutes. The presentation of my order was great. I felt the chicken was more on the tougher side, but overall I was good but not great. I felt it was a little overpriced as well ($12.00). The atmosphere was relaxed and the interior decoration was impressive.  Service was straight forward. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu. Maybe I'll go for something on the healthier side.",

Today 8/22/2016, I went here for lunch with some co-workers and the line was long so I ordered online which was not a problem.  Some of us waited in line to order to go.  I had placed my order and was given a time the order will be finished and mind you that my order was placed 5 minutes before the co-workers that waited in line.  I ordered the Ahi Srirachi and  Ahi Taco-San.  My co-workers ordered the Meltdown (medium well) and the other ordered Filet O Fire(well done).  Their order came out before mine and my order was finished 15 minutes after the given time.  We bring our order to work to eat and my Ahi Taco-San was delicious as normal but my Ahi Srirachi was not so.  The ahi was rubbery which normally means not fresh.     My co-workers Meltdown which she ordered medium well was at medium rare.  My other co-workers Filet O Fire which she ordered well done was about a medium.  So I guess you get your meats 2 levels down from where you want it.  I usually go here 3 times a month but I will not be coming here for awhile since there are many other options now in this area.  Maybe it is a new cook that they have or something.  This restaurant was one of my favorites but service and food quality is dropping.  UPDATE  I went back to Skinny Fats at a later date to give them a second chance and the food was delicious as normal.  I guess they had an off day or something but I will be coming back more often.",

I like the reusable cups as well. However, the food just never lives up to the hype. I have given it several tries and always want to like it, but no go. My burger was practically burned even though they take a temperature and I ordered medium. The truffle fries are always pretty chewy and old tasting.

They give you the calories for the healthy side. Honestly, I wish they would give you the calories for the happy side too. Maybe that's just me lol.   Anyways, I've tried a couple of things on their menu and I've liked most things. My favorite shareable is the shrimp in boat. It's on the healthy side & it's so good (has a little kick just FYI). If you don't feel like being healthy, you can definitely get the pimp shrimp from the happy side -- much yum. My favorite favorite thing ever on their menu is their sweet potato fries. My goodness. I don't think anyone else makes it like skinnyfats. It's always crispy & they put a little salt on there... heaven!   I'm deducting a star because it's a bit pricey, imo. But I guess that's how all the \"healthy hipster\" are nowadays.",

She explained that the menu has a healthy side and happy side. Happy side is naturally less healthy.   I got a delicious burger, the meltdown. It was amazing. My wife got the smotherload, a breakfast burrito with sausage and steak. It was amazing.  We also shared two turnip tacos from the healthy side, they are steak tacos with amazing flavor.   I would come here again and again. Great experience. Friendly staff, and great food....  Come here and come here often!",

The side of fries that they gave us was very skimpy as well.    My husband and I ended up throwing our food out and opting to grab something else from the fridge.   Very disappointing and will not try this place again.  I should have stuck with Fatburger or In and Out.",

I liked how the menu was split healthy and happy, something for everyone.   The cashier was nice and patient while I looked over the menu. I went with the Deep Veggin and the TATS sandwich with truffle fries. At about $20 with a drink it was quite an expensive lunch. I wish I had seen the complimentary cucumber infused water before I ordered but oh well.   The food came out all at once. The deep veggin was okay but the sauce was way too spicy for me. There panko breading was very plain. The TATS was pretty good. The bread was toasted nicely and it had lots of spinach and avocado. I didn't taste any of the \"spicy yogurt\" however. The truffle fries lacked any truffle flavor and were quite plain.   Overall it was okay, but I can spend half as much and driver half as far for a much better lunch.",

They separate their menu so that you can choose something on the \"Healthy\" side or the \"Happy\" side. It seems that their menu is almost mirrored in a way because if you see an item on the Healthy side you can look at the Happy side and see the alternative that is not as healthy and vice versa.   My favorites are the Chickawaffadopolis, Wake N Bacon, Meltdown, and Chix on Broadway.   Also, don't forget to check if they have any new items since they do offer items that are temporary and not on the menu! You don't want to miss out!",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW. ORIGINAL BELOW-  So I was given a credit from SkinnyFATS manager Jennifer and she was so sweet along the entire process. I ended up using my credit about a month after receiving it and I had no problems. I took my friend from out of town here and her first experience/my second experience was exactly what changed this review from a 3 star to 5 star.   I ordered the chix chicken sandwich while she ordered the 3 tacos with ahi tuna. Both dishes were incredibly well cooked and delicious. The presentation of my sandwich and potatoes were beautiful and as a foodie, that's important for me. I did end up plating the potatoes with the sandwich as they came on separate plates but both dishes were well cooked and delicious.   If I could suggest a bit of some heat with a sauce, something like chipotle sauce or the sauce from Raising Canes, would be perfection on the sandwich. It wasn't a dry sandwich by any means but I just felt like it needed some sauce to compliment the tender juicy chicken.   Literally this made my experience absolutely wonderful and the staff were very nice!   Original review below~  I've heard and seen many great things about this place but my experience wasn't the best at all. We ordered to go and all our food was pretty soggy and old. Our food also had a sweet taste to it when I don't think it should have. We ordered the more cow bowl, the naked chix and the classic burger. On my cow bowl the steak tasted and smelled old. I didn't have a fried egg on my bowl, in fact I had literally three pieces of scrambled egg in the entire bowl. The veggies were soggy when they should have been a little crisp from the description and photo of the dish. I don't want to say the whole place is horrible but as my first time visiting here, it was pretty bad. The only upside was the decoration and speed as I was picking up my food from the place itself. I love the art on the wall",

I recently tried the TeriAHI Tuna Sandwich and fell in love and now I can't get anything else here lol, it's that good! Their truffle fries are amaaazing and I love that their food comes out hot and fresh. My friend got a Philly cheesesteak thing and really enjoyed it. Also got to try their sweet potato fries that were really yummy.   Staff is friendly even though I came in close to closing time. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I feel that it is overpriced for what it is. This place feels like a casual lunch spot but I felt I was paying dinner price, but for the high quality and freshness, I don't mind spending a few extra $$$",

However, the food is right as rain. It's not too much to wrap your head around and in the simplicity lied good taste. My fare was a burger that, while not as spicy as I anticipated, was flavorful and generous and just the right combination to balance out nicely.   The seating can be hot or miss. Sometimes you can find seats and sometimes you have to hunt for them. We opted to stay inside at one of the huge wooden tables. The televisions we're not, thankfully, as intrusive as most places who have them are. The servers were quick and handled the doors and orders well.   I guess the best word I can describe this place as, is solid. I think that timing a visit is needed, as it does get crowded, but the food is worth a trip. I wouldn't call it cozy, but close to cozy. Pleasantly surprised here. Will come back.",

My burrito was tasty, and the chicken inside was super tender. I wasn't a fan of the massive amounts of avocado stuffed inside the burrito, but I'm sure other folks enjoy it. I ended up just using my fork and removing a bunch of the avocado, but if I were to order that again I'd just request \"no avocado.\" Unfortunately, I spent most of my time swatting away the pesky fly that kept landing on our food, table and bodies. It was so annoying! :/ I was hoping to switch tables as we were seated next to the door that opens out to the outdoor seating area. However, they were super busy and there weren't any other tables available ----let alone away from the fly!! Boo!  Both our orders were good though. The decor is nice and the staff were super friendly. In addition, their fruit smoothies are wonderful. I'd definitely return.",

My last visit I got the More Cow Bowl and it's a teriyaki beef bowl over egg fried rice with portobello mushrooms. I also got the two shrimp tempura tacos that had the perfect spice to them and my brother got the Cherry Popper burger. It's his favorite! He gets it every time and love that it has an egg on it. It was delicious! I also tried the frose and it was so perfect in this summer heat. If you haven't tried this place yet then I have no clue what you're doing with your life.",

The Buffalo sauce used to coat the chicken strips is one of the best buffalo sauces I have ever tasted where it's just the right amount of flavor and kick of spicy-hot that makes it just perfect! Plus, you get a lot of chicken strips for such a great price! Highly recommend! As for the customer service, it was very good! The cashier up at the front of the establishment was willing to answer all of our questions about the menu. One of the kitchen workers was able to grab us a box when we asked for one.

Half of the menu is indulging and the other half is healthy and it's the perfect place to go to meet friends so that there's something for everyone to order. Having said that, the menu can be a little overwhelming but with multiple locations, it's a good place to go back for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  My boyfriend ordered the meltdown which was AMAZING and I'll tel you, there's plenty of fat crusted on the butter fried sour dough bread that wraps 2 quarter pound burgers. Oh yes. He added corn bread on the side and it was a surprise because the corn bread was sized and tasted near a cookie. I went safe and ordered the hot chix, buffalo styled chicken strips with truffle fries and it didn't disappoint but I wasn't amazed (go figure).   They also offer all natural and flavored bottled ketchups, black peppercorn catchup, porky pineapple catchup along with tumerica hot mustard. I must say, I was excited about them and terribly disappointed.    I would definitely come back and be a little more adventurous on tasting different sides of the menu. Overall 4/5 because I haven't been convinced yet but I will go back for more!",

This is just a small sampling of what they serve here. When you walk through the doors a huge fan is circling above your head. It looks like a fan and that belongs in a bar somewhere next to the beach. When you proceed to the line there is a giant happy face behind you on the wall. It is a sign for the way the food is going to make you feel. Or I hope so.  The cashier was very friendly and pleasant. He answered questions that I had about the menu and the toppings on their menu items. I am so impressed with the customer service of the staff here too they take friendly to the next level ensuring that the guest experience is excellent. The service here is exceptional too.   The food is absolutely wonderful with the smell as it sits in front of you overwhelming. It stimulates the old factory and starts the motor skills to pick up the fork sensation. Delightful smells fill my head and delight my tongue.   I ordered the breakfast potatoes with only peppers. They were cooked to perfection and smell heavenly. The staff associate that brought my order to the table directed my attention to the various catchups that are only found here. With many varieties I found the Unipeppercorn the best flavor. One can taste just a subtle hint of the black pepper. The cauliflower rice that I ordered was divine too with the best smells coming from cauliflower at that. Being so impressed with this restaurant this will become a regular haunt.",

    "text": "I've heard very polarizing opinions about SkinnyFATS; some people love it, others despise it. After visiting a few times, I've finally formed my own opinion.   Just as polarizing as their publicity, SkinnyFATS' menu has an interesting dichotomy; one half depicts health-conscious, fit-inspired meals, while the other half is diabetes incarnate. It's really odd to see 400 calorie vegan burgers alongside burgers that require needing triple bypass surgery upon completion.   It's hard to define what's good and what's bad, because SkinnyFATS is such a hodgepodge compared to what you'd normally expect at a restaurant. What I will say is that anything you like, you will love. Recently I had the Naked Chix, which is Mango Basil Chicken with Jasmine Rice and Cilantro Mayo, and it was exceptional. SkinnyFATS also has everything dish labeled very well, whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, or eat gluten free like me!   You may have to explore the menu a bit to find something you like, but SkinnyFATS does a lot of things right. This location specifically can get packed during peak hours, especially since it's right across the street from a gym, but it has something for everyone, regardless of diet, which definitely makes it a good option when you're out in a group.",

Today when I ordered for me and my daughter, the girl at the register didn't ask if we wanted a drink and she was giving me my total bill. I had to ask her for drinks and then she only rang up one  instead of two, I asked her for drinks not a drink. Not sure if I will come back here to eat, the food is good but without the service it's nothing. Don't get me wrong, I understand there's always one that makes a good experience bad, but every time at this location there is always one.",

Both people I interacted with were so awesome and had great customer service, the guy who took my order and the cashier (sorry didn't get names).

It was ehh  STEAKation w/ Truffle Fries - Basically a roast beef sandwich in a sense that uses shaved NY Strip...it was good and had good flavor  Summer Quench - Juice that contains cucumber, celery, apple & lemon...fuck I haven't had fresh pressed juice in a long time and this shit was lightweight refreshing.

    "text": "I went here about a week ago with my grandmother. She's pretty picky and has a lot of food intolerances. But she was able to find something she liked on the menu. She chose the chicken and waffles. I like that you have the choice of the healthy side or the happy side. I like a place that can accommodate different tastes and styles of eating. I truly do like the happy food but really should be eating the healthy food. So I'm glad that my grandmother was able to get something from the happy side while I dined only from the healthy side. We ordered way too much. I ordered the two tacos: the Ahi tuna and the steak taco on the healthy side. I also ordered a kids size whole wheat pancake as a dessert. The tacos were about seven dollars and the large kid's sized pancake was only four dollars. My grandmother had the chicken and waffles and was also craving some sweet potato fries. I think the entire meal was $35 total. It was well worth it and there was a lot of extra food. I have never seen my grandmother eat so much. She ate the entire chicken and waffles. It came with four chicken tender strips and a large waffle. She loved it! My tacos were just OK. The meat taco was really good, kind of had a Mediterranean flavor to it. That he taco was bland and kind of boring. I probably wouldn't order it again. The four dollar pancake was a steel  (see picture). It is large and filling and enough for one adult person. The sweet potato fries were tasty, crisp, and hot. I tried a bite of my grandmother's chicken and waffles and thought it was very good too. All in all a great Monday afternoon lunch with my grandmother. She can't wait to go back there again and I would love to try it again as well. I wish they had places like this in Houston!",

I was excited based on the great reviews, but left very disappointed.   The atmosphere is fun, with a super cute outdoor patio. The healthy breakfast menu is a bit small, but prices are not terrible.  I got the rosemary jane (chicken and waffles). The chicken was very dry and flavorless. I needed water to help it go down.  Yes...It was that dry.  The waffle was also very dry...more of a consistency like dry toast.    My friend got the 3 healthy chicks, and the egg whites were sooooooo bland.  Salt didn't help.   But the turkey patties were good at least.    And while the food was bad, the service was even worse. The extra plate we requested never came, we had to hunt down our side of pancakes, and not one person ever stopped to clear our plates, so our table was overflowing with dishes. We had them stacked 5 high at one point and still no one stopped.  I give it 1 star for atmosphere, and 1 star because they have healthy options in a world with too few restaurants offering that.  The lunch/dinner menu does sound good,  so because of that and because of all the other great reviews,  I will give it just one more try in the hopes I just visited them on a (very, very, very) bad day.",

The kick of the pepper jack cheese and siracha cream cheese combined with the velvet avocado and (perfectly cooked) bacon give it a richness that is insanely irresistible on a brioche bun.

Also a tip, dip the CauliFIRE into their house hummus for an incredible flavor combo of awesomeness. Their skinnyFATS punch still has me coming back though. Now all that's left to do is eat my cookies and come back again. It's all so good here.",

The food is just complex enough that people who don't cook a lot would consider paying the price for. It's good quality and all very well put-together but if you know anything about cooking, you can easily eat on that level every day.  We went in for lunch on Monday and it was busy but not overly packed. We were able to order within 10 minutes and got a table right after. Fiance ordered smoke in the bowl and a soda, and I ordered the naked chix.  We also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to share. The bill was a shocking $26. The service was great and we got our food pretty quickly, but again for that price I was seriously like, I could've just made us this exact dish at home. I guess it's worth it if you're feeling lazy and just want a good healthy meal out and about.  Also, I liked the Naked Chix way better than the Smoke in a Bowl. Much better harmony of flavors. The bbq sauce on the Smoke in a Bowl was a bit bland. We had added avocado but it didn't go well. We ended up putting the avocado in my bowl of Naked Chix and it was much better!  They served us the chocolate chip cookie warm, which totally hit the spot with the sweet tooth!",

How about a place where you can feel good pretending to get a cheat meal in when actually the food here is healthy as hell. Well skinny fats is just the place.   The menu of this place changes with the season so don't be surprised when some of your favorites change. There are different seating options as well as I like to change what environment I am eating at. The food is really well portioned and comes out pretty fast which I think is impressive for a busy day when I came in.   I am not even that much of a health nut but I kero finding myself back at this establishment because the food here is so delicious. I also feel like they add extra care into making their food which is a difference you can taste. Either that it it's the fresh ingredients that they use. Regardless of what it is, the food here is amazing. So if you're in the mood for something healthy, or even if you're just hungry for sind amazing food, skinny fats is the place to be.",

My friend and I had just finished having a heated game of Disc Golf and we decided to make it interesting with a bet of \"lunch on the loser.\" I lost...he cheats...so, we came to SkinnyFATS.   I ended up going with a skinny steak sandwhich, the \"STEAKation,\" which is shaved NY strip with arugala, tomato, onions (I didn't get the onions), with a yougurt horseradish sauce, on a wheat hoagie roll.   The hoagie roll was ridic!! It was so fresh, I would have just been content with that. The sandwhich as a whole was good. It would have been better to have a little extra steak and yougurt horseradish sauce. I did get a side (truffle fries) with this for the $11 charge. The fries were outstanding.   I loved the drink choices, all natural soda's including burch beer, there were two different types of tea, and water with cucumber slices. I'm not a huge soda fan, but I tried the burch beer because I've liked it in the past. I opted for the fresh water.   My friend had the \"Smoke in a bowl.\" It looked appetizing, but too many onions for me.   Overall, fantastic experience. The prices were normal for a restaurant of this caliber.

It's a fun place, because they have two sides to the menu: \"Healthy\" and \"Happy\" (i.e., not healthy, haha!).  So, if you're friends with a super healthy person, or a super unhealthy person, there's something for either one!  I would say it's more on the expensive side, just for a small meal; but I enjoyed what I had, and definitely plan on coming back.",

You can pretty much make any meal gluten free by putting the ingredients in a bowl of brown rice (which I didn't even realize was brown rice).  The jalapeno ketchup goes together so perfectly that one would think that is how ketchup should have tasted all along.  The plates that come out of the kitchen look more like art than food, so fancy!  The entire staff is fun and happy to explain anything or grab anything for you.  I love that they have natural soda in fountain style.  Great place in which I will eat often!!",

The Warm Springs location just needs to work on the little details.  Visit once to twice weekly, and two weeks in a row, my medium burger was cooked well.  Even asked for a knife to show the staff just at the burger came off the line.  The food and beverage is phenominal, a consistently overcooked burger won't keep me from returning, but again, it's just the little details that could be improved to make it 5 stars.     Recently they've been shouting Hello and greeting guests entering the door.  I find this to be annoying, just like Jamba Juice staff shouting across the store to greet.  Refinement.  SkinnyFats is a unique brand that should not be giving into that.   It takes away from the brand.",

    "text": "Walked in at 9:45 am.  Not busy, which was great.  The food was good, but we could not get past the un-bussed and unclean tables. (Notice to management- you had 3 servers/counter staff not seemingly busy)   We ordered the #Merica* - (shaved NY chicken fried steak, 2 biscuits and a side of 3 eggs), the S'motherload (steak, potato's , eggs, peppers, cheddar & pico wrapped in a tortilla with \"Cajun cheese sauce), coffee, and a cold-pressed apple juice.   Husband says the apple juice deserves  5 stars itself! The #Merica was fine. We had to ask for a side of gravy as there was only a scant bit on each biscuit. The gravy had good flavor and the biscuits were good although slightly crispy. Their take on a breakfast burrito was much better. The sausage, sliced thin, was excellent!  I loved the potatoes as well. I have to say it would be better if there was a version without the steak and more potato, egg & sausage, which I'm betting they would do.  At the beverage bar they offered water with cucumber & lemon! Refreshing!   If I could offer 3.5 stars I would based on the juice and pretty good food. We would totally comeback to give them another try - hopefully the tables will be wiped clean by then.  Cleanliness aside, the staff was pleasant and did check on us several times.   P.S. Hallelujah! At 10:30, one of the staff started to clean the tables although it appeared that an owner or manager type had walked in.",

He then pulled up his underwear with his bare hands and proceeded to put plates together before sending them out. Disgusting.

The slaw was nicely coated and crisp, even my one year old loved it. My husband had the cherry popper burger, it was delicious. The meat had a nice fresh taste and the aioli was great. The truffle fries were super tasty. We ordered off the happy side and will definitely be back to try more and the healthy side looked great too.

It looked delicious and very promising: sweet potato fries, chicken, arugula, dried cranberries, and feta cheese. What I received for $10.00 was a bowl full of sweet fries, 3 small pieces of chicken, literally 3-4 cranberries, a sprinkling of feta cheese, and barely any arugula. Super disappointed to say the least! Had I known what I would be receiving I would have just ordered a side of sweet potato fries for $3.25.

    "text": "My friend and I decided to give this place a shot since we live very close by.. This place was all new to us and from the reviews we had read we were so excited to try it out... When I walked in I loved the atmosphere and the interior design only thing I didn't expect from here was the horrible customer service that was about to unfold... The girl who greeted us and checked us out was very rude, when I walked in I thought it was a restaurant where people sit us down and so I said table for two and she chuckled and said must be your first time... I was slightly offended but it gets better... As I was trying to review the menu and order she was too busy chit chatting with her co worker to assist me in any way... I asked her for a suggestion and she just showed me the secret menu on the tablet that's displayed... So I had to choose based on a picture, because she made it seem like it was such a big deal to describe some foods I was interested in... After I ordered I had to check out and ask the girl at the counter my friend has my wallet let me grab it; please keep in mind my friend was sitting at the table by the fountain drinks. It only took me a few seconds to get it and she was already taking another customer and the girl had the nerves to tell me \"Oh sorry... I thought you'd take awhile\" from there I was beyond irritated and annoyed... The food was good but not as good as I would have expected, my friends sandwich tasted a bit blend... It really wasn't like a WOW experience for me... Maybe because I came with such high expectations and with the poor customer service we had received from the start I was let down... Overall it was just okay, but to be honest my first time would have been a lot better if there was better customer service. PS the worker should never tell a customer NO PROBLEM, when a customer says THANK YOU... Because there wasn't a problem in the first place, we say thank you out of courtesy and respect... In return I would expect a YOU'RE WELCOME",

The prices to me can be lowered and still do well for business.  The music is hip and refreshing and so is the decoration.  Most definitely the vibe and the cool is here, but speaking about the most important, the food, I don't feel it's worth the \"healthy\" approach, cuz I can cook myself, or visit other locations that have a better budget, better dishes, and a not so crowded, overhyped hip vibe and wait.  It's not at all a bad business or restaurant, give it a try i'm certain you'll like it.  As a regular place for me, however, I'm over it :P",

So I asked for extra crisp ones and Nikki promised she would make sure herself that they were crisp & that I was satisfied. True to her promise she came out and asked how the truffle fries were, and they were indeed crispy but for whatever reason I still wasn't a fan of them. She offered to bring out plain fries (because my 3yr old son had them and I preferred those), but I declined. Nevertheless, and again True to her promise to ensure I was satisfied, she had some plain crispy fries brought out.  All of the staff last night seemed eager to please, and my wife and I felt like rock stars given the way we were being treated.   The food is great, the service is awesome.",

    "text": "Disappointed. Could of gotten mad but that would be the hunger talking. Where to start? Welp, I usually start the day at 2am in the morning. Go to the gym then start my shift at 5am in the warehouse at a near by home furnishing store. Packed my go to meal for lunch for work that usually gets me through the early part of the day. But today work was smacked with a whole lot of work load so needless to say I was hella hungry after the shift in which ended at 11:30am. So I thought man, SkinnyFATS sounds bomb right now. After hikes it'd be a spot to go to and eat and always hits the spot to where it satisfies the hunger but not fill me up into a food coma. That's eating the whole plate. So I go. I ask what's the specials for the day. The cashier mentions the benny reminding me that it's Sunday today which I should of known from watching some nfl highlights that they had up on the screen while I was waiting in line to order. I order the benny, the way it was explained sounded bomb as fuck and couldn't wait to try it. I chose to sit outside with the cool breeze today. One of those rare weather we get in the city. The perfect outdoors weather. Then I wait. While I wait I went on all the social media outlets to check out what kind of messed up shit is going on today. Elections, shooting there, memes here, etc etc...... I guess I dug a deep hole into social media that I didn't realize it was already 12:20. I gotta go fuckn pick up  my little brother in 10 minutes. Where was this bomb ass sounding benny!? I go up told the chick near the window to where the kitchen is, what's up. She ask the cooks if the benny was made but I responded I gotta go! So then she goes to another chick at the cash registers, comes back to me and informs me that I'd get a full refund, even with the half eaten salted caramel cookie and orange juice cracked open. Courtney, the chick at the register that processed the refund, the manager for the day, apologized. Seemed sincere. Now, here we could of made a \"scene.\" Could of milked the shit out of this situation. But nope that ain't me and ain't the place. SkinnyFATS is usually good to me. I wouldn't do em like that. Leave that shit to McDonald's or something. So Courtney and crew it's all good! I'll just come back another time or something. But I was still fuckn hungry. So I was late to pick up my brother cause I stopped by the next drive through I see and settled for 2 double cheese burgers :(",

They are prepared cooked in siracha which I thought could be to HOT  and the girl taking my order offered for the sauce to be on the side. The sauce turned out to be spicy  & sweet. It was really nice~    DEFINATELY if I am in the area I wouldn't hesitate to return ~ also the cauliflower rice which is actually cauliflower with buffalo sauce and a delish dipping sauce. Wasn't to spicy for me however my girlfriend about went up in flames after her first bite ~",

I got a chicken sandwich and truffle fries; both were very delicious!!! I also got a chocolate chip cookie...I've had better but it was still pretty good. The place is very casual.

It truly fuels me up for the day.   I normally order the wrap superstar. My favorite even if there is no rice with it. It it is on the healthy side of the breakfast board.   It's been a few months since I've been to skinny fats so when I walked in this morning, the menu board was different so it took me a little while to find the usual. However, I thought I'd be a little different and get something with fried rice. So I opted for the Mor Cow Bowl. Not my favorite at all. Let's just say that rice should be left to be made by asians. The rice was. Or cooked well that it was crunchy. I hate crunch rice. And I'm. It much if a beef water so the filet mignon was a little too much for me.   With the negative experience of the beef teriyaki bowl, customer service is always good, atmosphere is nice and clean and the outdoor patio is welcoming but it gets a little too much sun in the morning. And of course, the number of yelp events they have participated in leaves me appreciative. The food really is good here.",

We all ordered from the \"happy\" side of the menu and we were glad we did because the food was delicious!  We shared the Chickawafadopolis (Chicken & Waffles), Cinnutella (French Toast), and Wake N Bacon (breakfast sandwich).  The chicken and waffles wasn't anything too spectacular, but the other two entrees were amazing- the Cinnutella is covered in cinnamon sugar and served on top of a Nutella/chili sauce... I would definitely order it again!  We'll be back!",

I'm not a big cheese person, so I had the cheese put on the side. To my surprise, it was also amazing. So much I ended up putting it over the entire burrito. The ingredients were fresh, the steak inside the burrito was cooked perfectly. Also had the healthy berry protein waffles. Again. Amazing. Orange juice tasted like I bit into the orange myself. Honestly new favorite spot for sure! The people that work here are extremely friendly and informative of the menu for newbies like myself and I had a lot of questions. Plenty of dine in space and a patio. Can't wait to come back!",

Forgive me for not remembering their names from the menu, but you can figure it out. Everything we ordered was from the skinny side of the menu. Everything was fantastic except for the spicy cauliflower. I did not care for it. All of the above plus three drinks came out to $68.00 total. Well worth it. The quality of the food was excellent!!  I highly recommend this place. I will be back to try the fat side of the menu. The chicken and waffles look pretty good.",

    "text": "We used to go to the one located in Dean Martin, but since we came here we only come to this location on Durango. This one has the same great menu, but has waaaay more seating. The other location I felt like I started every meal upset because of the lack of space, organization and just general consideration from other people. This location even has a lovely outside seating area and a dedicated juice bar attached next door. Way to improve.   I love that their menu is divided in to healthy and not so healthy. Also, they only list calories for the healthy side. The kids both like this place, which is rare that they both agree on much and they have a cool kids menu with some good options as well.   One of my kids likes the chicawaffadopolis (chicken and waffles) but a good friend thinks the chicken isn't seasoned well and the waffle is nothing special. But we both agree that the Steak Eyes is really good. I personally like both sides of their menu.   They also have a digital frame that shows different specials they have going on. So be sure to watch that all the way through and see if something there catches your eye as well.  They have a nice variety of hot teas if you're in the mood and the coffee is decent and fresh.",

    "text": "I first met SkinnyFATS at Yelp events. Fittingly, I finally tried this location at an event of their own hosting.  SkinnyFATS is a local chain that has expanded not only all over Las Vegas and Henderson, but to at least one out-of-state store (Dallas) with reportedly more planned soon. They've stuck to their model of having \"healthy\" and \"happy\" halves to the menu from the start and have delivered delicious food from both sides whenever I've tried it.  Yesterday, I went to a paid event called Blind Beer Throwdown. Beverages won't be discussed here because they were nowhere near the normal purview of this restaurant (although you may encounter some of these beers if you head next door to the new Beer Zombies taproom often enough), but I definitely want to rave about how happy the food made me.  BALLS variant (normally $5.95/2 pc): pretty much their take on arancini. Crunchy deep fried goodness on the outside was to be expected, and it was delivered. Unlike the normal BALLS, this variant had red peppers inside and arugula on top. I don't recall hearing what the sauce on the plate was, but it was also fantastic. Oh, and we had 3 pieces per plate. Hooray!  Sweet Cheese Us (normally $12.95) w/ tots: the sandwich is most likely their normal Philly cheesesteak, give or take the pretzel bun. The bread to filling rating was a little high, but the filling was delicious. Beef, veggies, and cheese sauce were all harmonious in taste and texture  The tots... well, I can't seem to find that anywhere on the menu, so we seemed to get a special treat. These weren't bad. They probably got tossed in garlic oil considering what I tasted all the time. They're crispy enough outside and soft inside, but I'd actually prefer mine a little more well-done. It's probably a different preference than everyone though. As for the \"catchups\" which I tried with this, the jalapeno was a little too spicy for me (I'm more sensitive than some) and the pineapple was a little too sweet, but at least the black peppercorn was fine.  Stout Tres Leches Cake: definitely nothing I can find at all on the menu. It's a mini-bundt cake with tres leches flavor, and apparently they used a stout beer in it. It was amazingly rich, and the vanilla ice cream on top added to the fun.  Service was solid. They provided utensils and napkins for all, and they made sure of whether I was finished with food and beverages before grabbing. Complimentary water is available at the counter next to the register. Restrooms are in the back. Music isn't too loud.  I'll definitely have to remember to order some SkinnyFATS food the next time I'm at the adjoining Beer Zombies taproom. They've earned their success with their execution and creativity of what's simple food. And simple food can be a good thing.",

They do have the good and bad options so it's a win win!  My son had the Tats...basically it's a club sandwich. Just healthier. The fries were amazing! My daughter had the Ahi and shrimp tacos. She always gets this yet it doesn't ever come out the same. That's why my daughter gets one of each. Sometimes the ahi is better and other times it's the shrimp. She made the fatal error of ordering just the ahi one time and it wasn't a good day for those. I got the Chiamisu which is a coffee chia pudding with bananas and cacao nibs. Very cool on a warm day like today. I also tried the chicken taquitos which was a special. It was just ok for me. Chicken was a lot spicer than I expected. And on the dry side. They had a sour cream dipping sauce which was pretty runny. Almost milk like in consistency. That was my least favorite.  But I will give props for customer service. They were pretty attentive and super friendly. Glad to say it won't be our last time coming here.",

Not only does the food taste great, but we're presented on the plate very well. They also have different condiments to offer like spicy ketchup.

    "text": "During a brief visit to Las Vegas Super Cute Wife and I met up with my amazing Brother and super awesome Sister in law. We didn't really know what to expect but our party knew we are plant based and suggested SkinnyFATS.   The entrance is warm and inviting. You can look at the menu at a booth if you need some time or in the short line before ordering. I ended up with the Stuff on curry with Tofu as my protein. Super Cute Wife got the Vegwich. Now I'll have to highlight this point here. SCW is allergic to canola oil and asked if it was in the aioli or if the Portobello cap was cooked in it. The person taking our order didn't know and went to ask the chef. It is indeed cooked in canola oil (which is common but canola oil is really nasty stuff, it's an industrial lubricant, causes all kinds of inflammatory responses in the body etc) however they also checked to see if any of the Portobello caps were not yet cooked in canola. Fortunately some were not and they offered to cook her Portobello cap without oil. Bravo! The employees really put a lot of effort into checking, offering solutions and making sure she was going to get a delicious meal that would not bother her later. They bent over backwards for us and I can't say that happens often. We really appreciated the time and care we received in making sure our dietary needs were covered.   After we ordered and found outside which was nice and quiet. Our beers were brought out and followed by our meals. Everything looked delicious and was well presented. If you want to spice up your meal they do have a variety or really good sauces on the tables and next to the drink station. I quite enjoyed the flavors of my Stuff on curry and SCW liked her Vegwich as well.   I really appreciate as a plant based eater that SkinnyFATS has options for us that are outside of the standard salads that some places pass off as an option for plant based diners. If you are going out with a group of diverse dietary needs such as our party did you all eat well here. Thanks again for the incredible service. It really made the experience so much better. I will certainly be back, or will visit another in the chain given the opportunity.",

Ordering online is always a breeze, I get an email to confirm my order and then a text when my food is ready. This process has been smooth every time, I am not a fan of calling and love the antisocial privacy of online ordering! The employees are always smiling and friendly and I've never had an issue with my order.  My go to is the Bleu Balsamic, love the flavors and especially love the low calories of it! I went a little crazy and added on the fried pickles this time, I had never had them before so why not. They tasted like warm pickles...with a yummy breading....the sauce was really good but I'm not 100% sure they made me \"happy\" enough to order it again (there's a happy menu and a healthy menu) but I'm glad I tried them out.  Don't hesitate to try anything on their menu, everything I've had here is always good!",

Who thought of this? It's great for people like me who love to eat as heart healthy as possible. Discovered the self order kiosk yesterday due to the longer line and it has pictures of the food. That's awesome! Everyone working there seemed happy and able to answer my questions both visits bc I'm pescatarian and wanted to know about substitutions... yes they do them. But not at the kiosk. Good to know. Just love the place and can't believe I'd never been there! I had their special gratis cucumber lemon water both visits bc I came with my americano... bad habit I know. We left yesterday with the salt and pepper shaker. I guess we're officially \"skinnyfatters\" now lol. I suggest the tempura shrimp, ahi tacos, and zucchini spaghetti. I tried both ahi and tempura shrimp first visit bc they let me mix and match the tacos. Win win.",

PROS: - healthy options for just about the entire menu (each entree, etc choice). Likewise, grub options as well! - full expresso bar - food was freshly prepared and come out quickly - food was delicious  - cost was fair for brunchy, fast dine in restaurant  - service was great all around -location not far off the freeway  CONS: - this might not be a 'con' but the portions were appropriate. If you're super hungry or just a big eater, you may need to order a side dish - music made the ambiance really dull. It was some really slow EDM type music. Maybe it was the day we went idk but it killed the vibe.   TIP: This might be near a police station as there were a lot of cops coming and going. They seem to like the food here. So....ya...",

    "text": "I've been going to this SkinnyFATS for a while now because it is a few miles from my job. In the beginning, the NakedChix was the best! The gluten free cake was delicious and since I am gluten free conscious I was a very happy, satisfied customer.  The last about 3 times I have ordered from here, something has been wrong with my order. I am not one to leave bad reviews but this SkinnyFATS deserves this one. My recent order I got today from Postmates was a disaster. It started with my order, it was about 20 minutes after the order was placed so I called just to check up to see if they received it because GrubHub cancelled the order before so I wasn't sure if it had done it again. The lady I spoke to on the phone was very rude and demeaning. I decided to let that go because maybe she was having a bad day or it was busy.   Next, food was delivered so I was a happy camper! Open up the container and my food had onions (asked for no onions) but I could pick them off, no biggie. Naked Chix was alright, the rice was very Overcooked and mushy. The delicious pineapple sauce was watery and I could barely taste it. :( But I still ate the chicken because that was good at least!  To top everything off, it was time for dessert! My favorite thing that SkinnyFATS has, gluten free cake. It was put in a cookie bag...first of all. I though that was odd? I opened the package, grabbed the cake out and behold there was a rock in the bag. Not really a rock, but it basically was a rock disguised as a piece of cake. I'm PRETTY sure I was given the piece that is on display. It was hard in the middle and the frosting was squished. I tried to squish my finger in the middle and it was impossible.  Sad day for a SkinnyFATS lover. I will not be going back to this location.  *** UPDATE *** I was contacted and Jennifer has made up for the mistake! I appreciate that very much. The extra stars are for her. :)",

So we tend to eat elsewhere and then we see the marquee and say, 'we should have'   Anyway tonight we made it a reality and found ourselves inside ready to try the menu! I was feeling a little unwell, so I wanted something not so spicy and my my husband was wanting something just the opposite, spicy.   The menu offers many different options, gluten free, vegan, or you can have anyway that pleases you! Tonight I wanted tomato soup, this is my comfort food. Dating back to my childhood, I would feel ill or down in the dumps, tomato soup always brought me around. Tonight, however, I found the soup to be super thick, in need of some basic seasoning like salt! Croutons where fresh and crunchy, but the soup left me wanting, well comfort.   I also had the chicken, mango over jasmine rice. It was good, not too sweet and the cilantro sauce was no spice at all. I liked it and it met my 'light, less spice mood'  My husband got the blaze of thunder, spicy chicken, coleslaw, all on bun. Included choice of side, he got French fries! These where really good, fresh, hot, crispy little strips of potatoes, by far best fries in town!   The place is friendly, comfortable, good food despite my bland tomato soup. I see them growing in locations, which means more convenience and recognition, so will be stopping in more often! Oh and try their cookies, they are so so good!",

    "text": "I love the concept of SkinnyFATS! Looking for something healthier, but your dinner buddy wants to indulge, or vice versa? Don't worry!   SkinnyFATS has you both covered with their divisive menu that sorts the 'Healthy' options from the 'Happy' (and more glutenous) options. Just be careful though that you don't promise yourself you'll be good and then fall for something on the other side of the menu, like I do often!  On this occasion, my partner and I arrived late morning looking for something to give us some energy after exercise.   I went for the Bleu Balsamic, which is a steak salad with blue cheese crumbles. This was an ok dish. The portion size was good and all the ingredients were there, however unfortunately they weren't always easy to taste because the salad was so heavily dressed in the balsamic dressing. In my eyes, the balsamic should act as a tart but slightly fruity flavour that cuts through the salad nicely and balances with the meatiness in the dish, but this just cut through my tastebuds and made my eyes water. The steak was plentiful, if not a little fatty.  My partner was just looking for a snack and the 420 (secret) menu looked quite interesting on the screen as the pictures flashed by next to the cashier, so he went for the pre-rolls.  These were 3 tacquito-style rolls with chicken and guacamole. He didn't like these at all. As a lover of Mexican food and especially tacquitos, he commented that they were very basic and unfortunately bland. The guac appeared to have no seasoning and took up the mostpart of the roll, with very little chicken. It also came with a very strange sauce. He described it as spicy milk and I had to agree. Not good. He would not order these again.  A little disappointed that this trip wasn't as good as others we have had at SF. Seating was aplenty and staff at the till were friendly, although I don't think they should have an open kitchen for all the laughing and joking the chefs liked to have as it was a little offputting for diners.  Maybe a different dish, or a different restaurant would satisfy the cravings next time!",

Although recently it feels like quality has gone down a little compare to few years back.    Coffee When they first started they had wonderful coffee.  Bright, Fruity, Light Medium body with easy wash down with food.  Two years ago.... I think you guys changed the blend from mothership and now it just taste like every other coffee.  Your specialty coffee quality is no longer there.  I would pay $1 McDonald Coffee over current coffee(even though it is better in quality but not by that much). This angered me the most.  Juice Bar This juice bar is amazing.  I have no complaints.  People should try these more often with their healthy side meal.  It is awesome.  I always get meltdown with Sweet Ginger   Overall  This is great restaurant.  I just have little bit different standard.  As far as basic service goes this place is 100% awesome.  You don't have a servers at this restaurants which is great because you have don't have to tip people who barely do basic service these days.  If you are wondering if you need to try it or not I would say Give them a chance, I think i got 3 bad orders but I am still going there because what they are offering is better and environmental conscious practices.    I just few questions for manager. 1. Do you guys season your chicken normally? or No seasoning at all on the chicken or the batter?  2. Do  your cooks know how to fry chicken or am I just getting 3 bad consecutive order with Chickawaffadopolis?  I am keep getting over cooked dried fried chicken at 215/Decatur & Warmsprings.  Is this intended? I hate the burnt taste and last 3 times my kid won't eat it and I agree with my 3 year old.",

My husband got a burger and the kids got chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were probably the best tenders my husband and I have ever tasted which was awesome for the kids eating it. Also the fruit bowl side has a wide variety of fruit and you could tell it was very fresh. Overall if I was in the area I would probably try it again but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way again.",

The food is consistent and the employees are always happy and helpful. They are always cleaning and on top of things. The vibe and artwork make this place unique and set it apart from your everyday boring chain style dining. Prices are affordable and food is addictive and tasty. Thumbs up!!! : ) Favorites are Slow Boat to China and the Flat Chix and Greens.   Yes, the salt and pepper shakers are adorable.  They have legs and choose not to run away so leave them on the tables where they live.  Let me say this again, don't be a scumbag and steal the salt and pepper shakers...buy your own!  They have a delicious looking kids menu for the little ones.",

The menu is pleasing and sounds good, but that's where the illusion ends.  After getting our food, a steakcation and the meltdown with a side of truffle fries, we anxiously waited for our food.  When it arrived, my burger was super greasy and the meat and cheese were absolutely bland.  My girlfriend's salad was equally dull.  The meat lacked any flavor and the dressing failed to redeem the enjoyment of the meal.  The truffle fries were ok, but nothing memorable.  All in all, the food sated our hunger pains, but left us feeling completely unsatisfied.  A few hours later, I felt sick to my stomach.  I don't understand all the rave reviews, but it didn't sit well for us.  We won't return.",

It wasn't horrible but it lacked pop, I found it flavorless with no imagination for the price. In my opinion SkinnyFats overrated.

I could get 2 burritos at my favorite Chipotle for the price of one meal here.  And I am unsure how healthy the healthy side is.  Besides that, the workers here are great.

It reminds me of greens & proteins but the food had so much more flavor , better options and prices. They have a  on the girls bathroom and  on the boys which I thought was funny and cute. The do juicing there which I live for and it's not outrageously priced like most juicing places.

    "text": "I was obsessed with the Dean Martin location of SkinnyFATS but the long line and game of musical chairs to find a seat during what is supposed to be a stress-free and relaxing lunch break started to wear on me.   One day I decided to see how far off it would be for me to try this location and was surprised to find it takes about the same amount of time to get to from my starting point (UNLV).     What if I told you that the menu, friendly service, and aggravatingly small parking lot all existed at this location, but that you didn't have to wait in a 30 minute line to place an order or reenact the Hunger Games scrum to get a seat?   (cue harps and angels singing)  You can read my review of the Dean Martin location for a more in depth description of the food I tend to order, but one of the great things also about SkinnyFATS is they constantly update their menu (for the better!) and test specials for possible inclusion on future menus.   I'm a happy guinea pig for their experimentations.  My favorite relatively recent discovery here is the Hot Chix bowl which is essentially a buffalo chicken salad.  I find it hard to resist ordering.   The Pimp Shrimp is also awesome especially when stealing an idea from their awesome server Kelly to replace the cucumber boat with brown rice.   That should be another point of emphasis: they are awesome with substitutions!  If you see something on the menu that needs a few personal tweaks, don't be afraid to ask.  My old favorites the Cranburkey and Cherry Popper burger still hold up across locations as well.    Initially visiting this location felt a lot like cheating on the original.  Now over the course of the last year it's become wifey to Dean Martin's mistress status.",

This is one of the few places where it is actually somewhat pricey but I still enjoy going to it because I really like how the food is prepare and tastes. I normally sway away from places like this that charge a premium for the \"healthy\" niche but SkinnyFat does offer a great variety of selection that can help you be more health conscience but still maintain the flavors in the food. You don't have to sacrifice flavor for health.  The menu consist of a Healthy Side and a Happy Side. The menu mirrors each other meaning the items are closely similar, just varies a bit on ingredient choices and portion.   --------------------------------------------Food - 5/5--------------------------------------------------- Healthy Side!  VegWich - $10  Very delicious sandwich with portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, jalapenos, banana peppers, spinach with some horseradish yogurt as dressing.  This was something that my friend got one visit here and I came back to try it out. It was absolutely amazing, I never though I could enjoy a veggie sandwich that much especially when basically a mushroom based sandwich.  The dish has minor kick from the banana peppers / jalapenos and horse radish, sweetness from the tomatoes and the well seasoned mushroom creating a flavorful dish.  Skinny Q - $7.00  I ordered this the first time I came to Skinnyfats. It was late at night and I wanted a item that wasn't too heavy right before bed. To my surprise, this was very flavorful. The grilled chicken on flatbread with red onions, peppers, and cheddar lightly dressed with BBQ sauce and Ranch had the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. Highly recommend this if you are craving for pizza and want a healthy alternative.  Slow boat to China - $7.00  Late at night once again after exercise, we decided to stop by for dinner. I wanted something very light once again and I thought the name was funny and ordered it. I was reading the menu item and it listed this as \"Asian Chicken Salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/ almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli\"  For some reason I was thinking it was a salad, but it actually came out to be a full cucumber topped with asian chicken salad and the listed ingredients. To my surprise, I never knew a cucumber can be made into a full meal that was quite filling and delicious. After eating it, I was quite impress on how creative the chef was in creating this menu. It is not my favorite item on the menu, but I would recommend it for those that want to try something new or eat something light. It's basically a giant cucumber with dressing and chicken.   Happy Side!  Meltdown  - $12.00  Two 1/4lb patties with caramelized onions with cheddar and spicy aioli on sourdough. Once again, patties were well seasoned, the mix of flavors from the sicy aioli and caramelize onions mixed perfectly with the patties and bread. It was a very well though out dish and quite yummy if you are looking to eat \"Happy\" tonight.  Special Item - Mac and Cheese   I decided to try out one of their special items that was on the menu that one day. It was basically a giant bowl of Mac and Cheese with chicken friend steak like meat. (Wasn't exactly sure what it was). I am a big fan of Mac and Cheese and decided that I will spoil myself that night. It tasted great in the beginning but you start realizing that it was a lot of Mac and Cheese and got kinda boring as you kept eating it. Not a highly recommend item on the menu, but it was still very tasty. ----------------------------------------------Service 5/5------------------------------------------------- Service is great, employees are very helpful in helping you make a decision on the menu after it could be quite confusing your first time. The employees are very up beat and seems to embrace the companies culture.  --------------------------------------------Cleanliness - 5/5--------------------------------------------- Very clean atmosphere, great for lunch, dinner or get together with friends.   Overall Great experience and great food every time. It is one of my favorite places to go in the southwest with friends. Normally stop by there for dinner late at night when we want to have the option of eating a bit cleaner, or a great location during a lunch break. Also with the creative menu, there are always items I still want to try.",

It was much quieter and they have outdoor heaters too :) I ordered the Buff Chix and it came with truffle fries. It was good but not great. I think the buffalo sauce was a little too empowering and the chicken was pretty soaked in it. I also wish it was stacked on top of the fries cuz then my fries were soaked in buffalo sauce too. Other than that, the service was nice and the atmosphere was even better. I felt like I was in Cali or something lol. We need more hip places like this on the Southwest side.",

    "text": "Some of their items are a little hit or miss and SkinnyFATS can get pricey pretty quickly, but the quality of the food is hard to argue against. I had a waffle sandwich my last time out here, definitely a Happy side special, but it still wasn't so bad. While it was supposed to be a pumpkin chicken waffle sandwich, there wasn't much in terms of pumpkin flavor. That being said, the flavors were excellent.  My friend got the naked chix, which was pretty good with the mango sauce, but the rice is rather plain. However, we mixed in a bunch of habanero chili sauce with our order of truffle fries and the rice and everything got tastier!  I've enjoyed SkinnyFATS before, but the new location is both roomier and easier to get to for the majority of people. Their layout is fresh and modern, with a nice outdoor area really adding to the amount of people they can handle. I look forward to visiting more often now that the location is more convenient.",

The communal table is cute though with the pallet stools.  Ordered Two things one yummy one not. The ahi tuna was delicious! The whole lot of mess fries not so much, too dry for me.

We were greeted immediately, and asked if we had any questions, staff was very friendly. I ordered a Cranburkey Burger with a side of fruit, and my lunch pal ordered the Nice to Greek You flatbread. We both got fountain drinks and it was around $25, not bad!   I loved the decor, very bright and hipster/yuppie which I'm all about. I also loved that their fountain drinks were cane sweetened Boylan soda!! Awesome! And their cups are re-useable/dishwasher safe!   We sat outside and it was so comfy and nice. It would be awesome at night with the twinkle lights they have strung up.   The flatbread was a nice size, my companion didn't leave hungry, or overly full. Good toppings ratio, nice presentation.   My burger was great, I wish I had thought to add cranberries at home! The bun was delicious too. I appreciated that the burger wasn't loaded with salt, like at so many other restaurants, and the bun wasn't slathered in butter, but was still moist.   We would definitely come back here, both the healthy and happy sides of the menu looked delicious, and I LOVE the concept!!",

Be warned - this location is a little far from the strip. It's a newer location, but well worth the drive. There's plenty of seating inside with a large community table in the center. I like how their stools are 4 feet high. There's also seating outdoors. Overall ambiance: hipster.   Food (all on the happy side): 1. Chicken n Waffles Nicely fried (but not oily) pieces of chicken tenders. Served with a thick waffle and syrup on the side. This was GOOD, but not amazing. I ordered this because I was craving something along the lines of fried chicken and breakfast, but I wouldn't order this again.   2. Ahi tuna taco Not worth trying in my opinion. My expectations of ahi tuna is either RAW or seared RARE. This ahi tuna was neither. Tuna was deep fried, and the center was very dull pink. Comparable to tuna in a can? I'm leaning towards that put down.   I would return to try other items on their EXTENSIVE menu. Which reminds me:  Dear SkinnyFATS owners, please include some sort of pictures on your text-heavy menu. My eyes and alcohol infused brain do not have the attention span to read and decipher your food map.  Otherwise, rock on with Vegan Diabetes.",

I have yet to come here and experience a wait for a table. The waits have all been short, but a wait is a wait.   Secondly, I have ordered from their \"everything\" else side just one time because their healthy side is that delicious! I switched sides for the Chicken & Waffles which, if you're wondering, is worth it!  I ordered the Cranburkey burger from the healthy side the first time I stopped in, and during this visit. I wanted to try something else, but something about that perfectly cooked cranberry turkey patty called me back. I did opt for the truffle fries instead of the sweet potato fries though...so my meal wasn't 100% healthy. I washed my meal down with a glass - or more like, awesome reusable cup - of their fresh strawberry lemonade.   I will be back. Many times. SkinnyFATS is GOOD.",

Expectedly the first patron of the day as the doors unlocked it was with a short explanation of the \"Live Healthy, Live Happy\" concept that I was greeted on entry and after piecing together an order to be delivered in two courses a table was selected - College Gameday projected on one wall while a flatscreen displayed the same for those soon to form a line.  Generally not one to dine-out healthy as my weekday consumption is essentially 100% 'clean' it was from the \"Happy\" side of the menu that breakfast began and with free WiFi plus an informative conversation with Mr. Slobusky helping to pass the time it was not long before the first round arrived; the juicy tenders atop a crisp yet pliable waffle pleasant yet predictable with pseudo-Maple syrup that unfortunately added little while the daily special \"One Eyed Monster\" proved a far more innovative concoction with smoky bacon adding just a bit of crunch to a breadbowl reinvention of traditional biscuits and gravy that likely won't find its way onto the Healthy side of the menu anytime soon.  Moving on to more happy things as Reed discussed everything from On Strip expansion plans to Boylan's line of soda, course two began with a triple stack of buttery pancakes beneath an pile of bananas, whip, marshmallows, and chocolate that entirely delicious even without the aforementioned 'syrup,' and once again eschewing any semblance of dietary discretion its tablemate UnBRIElievable would offer the best bites of meal with the eggy brioche proving impressively crisp around a core of molten cheese and fresh berries with while fresh basil and reduced Balsamic provided an aromatic finish that lingered on the lips.  Never one to invest in 'quick casual' or the kind to be caught off-guard craving a 'healthy' meal outside the home my appreciation of Mr. Slobusky's concept hinges largely on the fact that SkinnyFATS is a bit of an anomaly in the growing trend of 'quick and healthy dining that seems to be overtaking many local markets - not only because it is locally owned and operated, but also because it offers the sort of menu that is built to please all palates without seeming preachy or judgmental in the least.",

I love the idea of having an outdoor seating (even though its getting quite cold now) but it would be great when its like.. mid 70s low 80s ! *heart* haha they have a good amount of seating (much more and spacious compared to original location) and also a huge table for those single go-ers or if you just like the bar height style seating !   coming to this location, its not a first time experience. but considering how close it is and convenient, my friend and I had determined to try something new every time we come here :D   my favorite item - chix on broadway - Breaded chicken breast, BLT, cheddar, red onion & lemon herb aioli on brioche w/side - im actually not sure if this changed or it was maybe a 1 time thing or chef difference.... the chicken was bigger (not complaining) but a bit dryer and not as juicy and flavorful as i remembered...   truffle fries... again i think it my be a location or 1 time thing... first time i ordered this, the fries were a bit soggy, and not as fresh/crisp. still love the availability of the jalepeno ketchup hahah XD   chik-a-waff-a-dopolis - fried chicken tenders over buttermilk waffle - the fried chicken tenders were seasoned really nicely (similar to the chicken in chix on broadway) but the waffle was a bit of an upset. yeah its big but too firm. not as light and crispy as i had expected a waffle to be like. the  wrap supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a WW tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt - one of the first lighter menu items ive tried..... and it is definitely lighter ... in terms of calories (i think) and flavor... a bit bland actually... the cajun cilanto lime yogurt is not enough to eat with the entire wrap.   finally got to sit outside for once but unfortunately it was getting cold (jacket weather) and they couldnt figure out how to turn on the gas space heaters (tip - low on propane.... Lol)  after tryin the healthier side.. i might be a bit more biased than i already was towards the non... healthy side hahah XD !",

I've already become a regular and I don't intend to quit. I even sent out a mass email in the office and almost everyone has been to try it.   Apart from the food I'd have to say my favorite part of this location is the layout. So much more room and gotta love the outside! If I could I'd eat outside all day every day. The furniture is of course cleverly recycled pallets. It's a great atmosphere all around.   Although I'm a bit upset they took away my favorite chopped salad I've ventured out onto the healthy side of the menu. One of my favorites has to be the hummus chicken sandwich which has sprouts on it. HUMMUS AND SPROUTS!!  If you haven't been to the new location, check things out for yourself.",

I was so excited to go back but so out of the way to go.  Now this location popped up a couple years back, I've gone about 5-6 times last year, and I'm just addicted to the service and food. Initially the price scared me, but so much freaking food for the price and most important...quality!  My favorite item on the menu is the Filet O Fire. I got this bad boy about a week ago, and my partner wanted to steal it. He had cinnutella, and even those gorgeous and delicious, nothing compares to Filet O Fire.  Thanks for the great business, and my partner and I  can't wait to come back for the boozy brunch day- big OJ mimosa? Yes please!!!!",

That being said there were two things I really wanted to try: truffle fries and chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (chicken and waffles). Happy too say I got to try both because I went with friends and we sampled eachothers!  I had ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed at all! It looks small but omg! It was so filling and had so much! The chicken was so tender, it was cooked to perfection.   My cousin order the buff chics which is buffalo chicken strips! That was so good and she had truffle fries which are the best!  My other two friends ordered sweet things like the drunken monkey cakes, which is super sweet, big, and delicious, (it has bananas and marshmellows!) and unBRIEleviable, which had berries and Brie. I love Brie! Such a yummy brunch with the girls! I can happily say I will be coming back!",

The Drunken Monkey Cakes!!! I swore I would get them the next time and they lived up to every imaginable fantasy I had in my head. Every bite was just more epic then the last.   I have tried a few things from both sides of the menu and have never been disappointed, as i am writing this I am debating on enjoying lunch or dinner over there today.",

Let me put it politely - It was disgusting and we threw away all of our food after the first bite.  We ordered delivery via Postmates and received our order within 30 mins.  Nobody really complains about fast delivery but that should have been our first warning.  We did receive our food hot, I ordered the Chix on Broadway sandwich with a side of truffle fries and my husband ordered the Bomb Diggity with a side of yummus pita.  The breaded chicken on the sandwich was bland.  It had absolutely no flavor in the fried batter.  Also, the bread on my husband's sandwich tasted old and rubbery and his sandwich in general was justcompletely dry.  The yummus was also very bland.  Everything tasted like it was prepared days before.  Honestly, we would've been better off ordering from McDonalds.     We are so disappointed with our experience and will never eat at this restaurant ever again.  PS... We both got extremely sick after eating the food.",

She loves the peanut butter smoothie and sweet potato fries.    The first time at this location, I got the chickhumm, which is a chicken breast sandwich with hummus and sprouts.  Skinny side.  It was good, but not oh-my-gosh.  I've learned that I need to only get stuff from the fat side!  The last time I went there, I got the sweet cheesus, which is a steak sandwich with nacho cheese and hot peppers.  Totally more my style!    I sent my hubby here and twice he got stuff from the skinny side and said it was decent but not excited to go back.  I told him that he needs to get stuff from the fat side, obviously!  I mean, I'm glad they have those options, but we eat healthfully at home usually, so I'm just going to continue only getting from the \"happy\" side.  :)  It is open until 11pm, which is great for us, because we can pick stuff up after work (hubby works late and it's hard for us to get food after 10pm).  For that, we are thankful!  Also, the price is very affordable.  I'd rather spend $12 on an OMG sandwich than go to Subway late and spend $6 on bleh.  Thanks, SkinnyFATS, for making yummy food available in the SW and open late enough for us to enjoy!  We will likely be here once a week.  Even the kid keeps asking, \"Are we gonna go to SkinnyFATS, Mommy?\"",

Aside from a long-ish wait to place my order, and a long wait for food to be delivered, everything was great! It was a busy Sunday, so I totally understand the wait time. The food is delicious, and the staff very friendly. I only order from the Happy side of the menu, cause I am an inner fattie, but of course they have their healthy options as well. I didn't love the Benny of the day as much as I did some of the others, but it still was tasty. The Cherry Popper burger is amazing as always. Prices for entrees range from $10-$12 on average. I also love that the drink cups are reusable- I've got quite the collection of SkinnyFATS cups at home!  I will definitely be back- again and again!",

Fries are shoestring with a truffle oil, really good.  Ahi poke sandwich was really good.  Sweet potato fries were great.  I really like the jalapeno ketchup.  A few ketchup choices available.  The beer was great.  Nice patio.  I highly recommend especially if you are trying to keep it light and skinny in Vegas.  Just heads up-no alcohol at the one by strip on Dean Martin.",

They have fresh ingredients and the flavors are great. Their decor is made with recycled materials and it's very interesting. We also tried the cheesy risotto balls which is great to share.

This concept really makes me conscious and aware of what I am putting into my body!   Typically, my go-to is the Veg-Which, which is a mushroom burger that is to die for! I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers, but they lather this baby with tomatoes, jalapenos, sweet peppers, pickles and their special sauce! It comes with an amazing bun that is not greasy as well as your choice of a side! I always get the, \"yummus\" with cucumber to be healthier but sometimes I splurge for the truffle or sweet potato fries! As someone who doesn't eat red meat, this burger is one of the best and affordable vegetarian options and beats places like Yardhouse and BJ's by a landslide!   I love that they make all of their own condiments including hot sauces, ranch, spicy ketchup, and more! Also, they make their own soft drinks and beer! Haven't tried the beer but definitely going to soon!   Overall, SkinnyFATS is an innovative concept and a great combination of healthy and savory. So grateful to have this local concept in so many locations across the valley. The quality and the care that goes into creating such innovative food concoctions is refreshing! If you haven't been, you won't regret it!",

Unfortunately, the food was not at the level of the service and very disappointing. I got the zucchini and they were uncook and floating in the tomato sauce. My guest had the burger who was very blend, the truffle fries were really bad. I am not again frozen French fries since generally they are better than real potatoes but at least pick up some good one please. Lot of the food coming out was fried and look not clean and unhealthy. Overhaul , I did not get the entire concept and maybe I miss lead myself with the name of the restaurant.",

Much bigger with outdoor patio seating , but parking kinda sucks. This location is also open until a bit later , from 9 am to now 10 pm.  As for food- there are so many options , both good and bad eats depending on how you're feeling. There's always something for everyone. Never had anything I didn't like here. My favorite entrees are either the teri-ahi or steakation sandwich. Definitely get their sweet potato fries over the truffle fries and try them with their jalapeno ketchup. Their taco ahi-san is amazing , two tacos are enough to be filling.  They also have great smoothies and cold-pressed juices. Their smooth immunity smoothie reminds me of an orange julius , but better. I hate soda but their cream soda here is pretty good.  They also have a secret menu available as well as a different Sunday sundae every Sunday of the week :)  Average check is around 10$-20$+ depending if you get any sides or a drink. Pretty pricey but I love the food here. Always a go-to for a casual lunch or dinner.",

Wasn't fantastic. Love the Summerlin location, but on a cold, rainy night, I was unimpressed. Didn't even finish my soup and left.",

I like that you have the choice, depending if you're looking to indulge or opting for clean eats (the \"healthy\" section is 600 calories or less).   The rustic decor is intriguing & industrial with random surprise accent pieces with vibrant colors, and the service is efficient yet friendly. We came in feeling like breakfast, and luckily this place has an all-day breakfast section of the menu!  For her: - STEAK EYES (happy side): country fried filet mignon medallions over biscuits with gravy topped with two eggs. So much flavor, worth every calorie! ;) For him: - PINEAPPLE JACKS (healthy side): 2 multigrain protein pancakes with grilled pineapple & turkey bacon. This is actually served with pineapple syrup and hot pineapple slices, but ironically he doesn't even like pineapple. He got this on this side, which I happily ate & tried with it... so yummy!",

I hadn't come back to any of their locations since. (This was in 2013-2014 at least) I went with a friend who insisted. I begrudgingly agreed.  WOW!! I've been MISSING OUT!! That 2 Nuts though!!! For under 300 calories it's a pretty spectacular little lunch, not to mention clever in that cucumber boat.  I ordered the hot chix salad. Blue cheese, avocado, buffalo chicken, pico, fried jalapenos.  The whole experience was different this time around. Previously I wasn't aware that they had fresh juices. In fact, when I originally went, I really don't think they did. I'm so happy I gave this spot another shot, I will be a regular now without a shadow of doubt.  Also, one small side note.... how stinkin cute is the outdoor seating area at this location?!?",

I got the melt down which is a burger on sourdough with a spicy aioli, cheddar, provolone,  tomato and onion. (I didn't get tomato or onion). I was unsure about the spicy aioli at first but it was really good! And not very spicy. I got it Fries which were also very good. However the burger was very greasy from the butter on the sourdough and kind of messy but definitely worth it! My boyfriend had the cheesesteak which was also very good. We tried a peanut butter cookie and that wasn't very good I don't recommend it. It is kind of pricey but it's pretty good and you get a decent amount of food. Overall I recommend it and definitely suggest trying the meltdown or cheesesteak.",

Seriously, I find myself ordering off the \"fat\" side menu much more than the \"skinny\". I think they recently renamed a few items on the menu so I don't recall them (you'll have to check the descriptions when you go), but my favorites are the philly, the burger, hot chix, yummus, and slow boat to china. Also, truffle fries and the sriracha aioli (as mentioned above) are a MUST!   I'm not a huge fan of the juices. I do love their unique soda machine there. Also COOKIES. Yum.   Indoor seating can be cramped in certain areas of the restaurant. Outdoor is nice when the weather is right. I really like ordering online and then swinging in to pick up.",

I like this location better that the Dean Martin because you can actually sit down with out having to wait for someone to finish their meal and then you pounce on a table like its they prey of a mountain lion.  I had the Wake N Bacon sammie which is topped with fried egg, thick cut applewood bacon, avocado pepper jack cheese and sirracha mayo.  Yum!  just enough heat for your taste buds to keep it interesting.  I had the country potatoes with this one and they were just ok.  They tasted like they had been sitting in a warming pan because of the mushy texture and lacking crunchiness.  We also had the Mean Bean which is a spicy black bean veggie burger heaped with half a sliced avocado to cool down the temp.  Good balance in this dish also.  We had the Truffle fries with this entree which are always a fan favorite.    Either way I will be back to sample more of the menu.",

Omg, I looooove!!! The chicken strips on the waffles were SO TENDER!!!!! Perfect amount of flavor. The waffles were delishhhhh! Got a side of gravy and man, I was dipping my fries in it like it was ketchup. Perfect combination. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. The truffle fries were so truffle-lyyy.. I could tear up because I was happy haha. The breaded chicken burger was amazing. I had it with the peppered ketchup they put out on the table along with the chipotle ketchup. What went well with it too was the syrup from the waffles and the gravy. Drool!! I'm so excited that they are making one downtown Summerlin. Much closer to me and I'll definitely be there every week!!!! This place is that good. I recommend it to anyone that love their healthy foods and feelin' a bit naughty with those fried goodness.

(The cherry popper) Especially if you're feeling fat one day you can decide to get a fatty burger or If the next day you decide you want to go on a diet and eat skinny you can still eat here. I love how they have fresh cold pressed juices for you to buy, and a whole selection of healthy food (,: price range is moderate, not too expensive but like $9.50 for juices. the workers are always extremely nice every time I have come here and the place is decorated like I don't even know how to explain but I feel small being in there and the outdoor seating is like a little backyard it's so cute. Oh! And I had to add they play all the best songs in here I wouldn't mind eating here everyday if j could only issue is that I think they should open later past 10 maybe at least 12! But this place is totally hipster and the food is actually really good so I'd definitely recommend for everyone to try this place out!!",

Watched 6 other to go orders (who placed orders after me) get called out and walk out before me... Turns out they didn't even call my name... (To busy yapping amongst each other) ended up putting my order under a \"heat lamp\" in the back until the girl who rang me up realized that i was still waiting... Told another employee that i was waiting... When I received my order the employee said to me \" Im sorry i put it under the heat but im sorry Have a nice daaaaay...\"  I asked if she even called out my name and she replied \"Im sorry... Have a nice day...\" Leaving me with soggy slop to bring my pregnant wife... Horrible experience I will no longer be visiting this establishment do to the complete lack of customer service and care. Good riddance....",

I have to get a Liquid Defense, which is a fresh squeeze juice, every time I visit, which is on the healthy side. If you want to do something on the happy side the cucumber delight with frozen yogurt is refreshing and delicious. They make a special eggs Benedict on Sunday's, it's different every week but always amazing. My favorite dishes are the pocket jacks, cranburkey, and ahi srirachi. Make sure to always check there Instagram or specials board when visiting for limited time dishes. Enjoy",

Their clever concept of having both a \"skinny menu\" for those calorie counters out there & a \"happy menu\" for those who just want a yummy meal ensures there's something tasty for everyone. My favorite breakfast item is the \"wake and bacon,\" a delicious breakfast sandwich with an egg frittata, avocado, cheese, and sriracha cream cheese on a sweet Hawaiian bun. This is a must try on the \"happy\" side of the menu. I've had nearly every item on both sides of the menu and haven't been disappointed once.   In addition to having amazing food, the customer service is outstanding. All of the employees are warm, welcoming, and polite; customers are greeted when the arrive and as they're leaving. While all of the employees are friendly, Jennifer stands out! She always goes out of her way to make me feel important.  Give SkinnyFats a try & you'll be happy you did!",

The locations are both very tiny for a sit down restaurant, and usually packed. That isn't a huge downside for me, but it can get crowded quickly. There are some really inventive and healthy options for non- gluten free people who love trying new food. Go for it (:",

It gets pretty crowded & sometimes it's hard to find a seat. The only thing I haven't liked that I ordered was the Naked Chix. I loved the Slow Boat to China & pressed juice I ordered. My family usually orders off the Happy menu & everything has been really good. Last time I went I got sweet potato fries & they were a little undercooked, but tasted pretty good. This is a great place with lots of delicious options on the menu.",

This burger had to be cut in half and I had to open wide to get this one into the digestive process.

In the mean time the waiter asked for the card so he could refund the amount back. A short time later the Manager or Owner came by and said he was sorry and we said \"we understood that things like this happen\" instead of just refunding my wife's dinner back he refunded all of our dinners back.

I ordered off the skinny one only cause doctors orders but I was surprised it was delightful and scrumptious... my friend also ordered skinny and she was satisfied as well... I am pretty eager to try the fat side...",

I feel like Vegas doesn't have enough places that focus on fresh, unique, and healthy meals. This place gives you a California vibe because of that. I was taking a look around and their presentations are beautiful! It makes the plate so much more appealing and gets you eager to eat lol. I got the berry the steak which was so delicious! It sounded like a strange pairing to do the shaved steak with blackberries but surprisingly, it went together really well. My boyfriend got a burger with truffle fries. His burger looked and smelled yummy, but the truffle fries were cold and soggy. Other than that, I am satisfied with my visit and excited to try something else from their extensive, unique menu.",

Everything that I ever had though was pretty spectacular and working with them was wonderful. Reed is a great guy and made it all look so easy!   Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for amazing party food or even if you want a tasty bite to eat. I love that their menu is split up into skinny and fat, such a unique idea, and I also love their new location. A really lovely upgrade from their previous establishment.

The morning shift people need more energy, especially for the start of everyone's morning this should be important. This is what brought it down to 2 stars .. makes me not wanna come here again.

The sugar cookies with powdered sugar are really good when they are fresh and warmed up!   The seating isn't so good on a busy day between noon-3pm. The place is usually swamped! The specialty healthy drinks are okay. They all taste watered down in my opinion. It may be because I am used to juicing at home. I use the same ingredients as they do at skinnys so I don't understand... For some reason mine has a richer stronger taste to it.   Anyways I do like this place a lot because it is conveniently located. It also has a variety of different choices in food and I just seem to never get tired of this place!",

The options were a bit overwhelming and as a vegan I expected more meat free selection (for reasons unknown). I was sad to see that some of the only vegan things were fried. The girl at the counter was very very nice though and had no qualms explaining the menu.  To start I got the rosemary hummus and vegetable chimichurri which was undoubtedly the best thing on the menu. My hangover remedy juice was yummy, no complaints there but the mean bean vegan burger I got was gross. Mouth feel was all off, and the whole thing just lacked flavor and texture in all aspects.   Atmosphere and staff were great but the food I may have to give a second shot.   Update: no more hummus and vegetable chimichurri :( that's sad",

Unfortunately it was not a good experience and I'm not sure I want to go back even though the menu was interesting. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich that comes with pickles on a Hawaiian bun. The bun was all flat and squished and even though the chicken looked good it was covered with a gigantic blob of drippy, hella spicy, chunky sauce. I've never tried anything so disgusting and I normally like spicy things. After a couple of bites I tried just moving all the grossness to the side, including the soggy bread, so I could just get some chicken, but it was too late. The awful spicy disaster destroyed any remaining taste buds and I have felt on the verge of vomiting ever since.  Only good things I can say is the staff was nice and the sodas were good.",

I thought it was great how the skinny side displayed calories and the fatty side didn't.   I had the naked chix bowl: chicken breast, brown rice, mango salsa. It was soooo good! The chicken was grilled well - neother greasy nor dry. The mango salsa wasn't overwhelming and didn't drown the chicken and rice. If I remember correctly, it was around 400 calories and fit well within my macros.  My friends ordered the el presidente burger with fries, the lentil soup, the boat to china, and the hot chix bowl (buffalo chicken salad). Everyone finished their food so I'm guessing they found their food to be delicious as well.   The ambience was super chill and the restaurant was clean. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food and the fresh taste. Staff was friendly and offered great suggestions. Hope they expand to San Diego but until then I'm definitely going to come back whenever I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is a review of the Skinny Fats on Warm Springs, their Dean Martin location is smaller, but always amazing.    Every time I have gone to the Warm Springs location I have unfortunately had to wait 30 minutes to 45 minutes for a To Go order. The first time I ordered 2 of the Ahi Taco San with no mango pico and an order of the BuffChix. I know from going to the Dean Martin location that with anything made to order there would be a small wait, plus they were a little busy for lunch service. After 20minutes of watching people that came after me now receiving their food, I started to get worried. But I continued to wait, sipping on the complementary cucumber lemon water, which is quite refreshing. After another 10 minutes one of the staff asked if I needed help and told him that was just waiting for my to go order. He said that he would check on it and after another 15 minutes I finally received my food. A super tall gentleman said he was sorry for the long wait time and asked for my name, number and email so he can \"make it right\". I got home to my now super hungry wife and to her dismay, there was mango pico all over the Ahi Taco Sans. I  also haven't received an email/telephone call to make things right since (about 3 months ago).    Last night the same thing happened again. Except it was only 30 minutes wait and the good news was that there was no mango pico, the bad news was that her Ahi taco San was now cold.     Two out of Three times we have visited this location have been disasters. I love the Dean Martin location, and will probably continue business there. Still hoping you can make things right with a repeat customer.",

We ordered the chicken and waffles, french toast and the rediculous. All were great! Only tip, with the red velvet waffle, don't get it extra crispy as it is already crispy. We will be back soon!",

The only down fall (this is just my own taste buds) I don't care for the soda at this location. I am not accustom to the flavor and it didn't pull me in the fist time I tired it. Besides that I recommend this place to everyone, it is AWESOME!",

Everything on the menu sounded so good, we couldn't decide what to eat, so we got everything!    We got...  The Meltdown: fantastic, filling sandwich with perfectly cooked meat, and tons of cheese melted together. The bread was also perfectly buttered and grilled to crunchy perfection. Came with tasty truffle fries.  Nice to Greek you: most delicious flatbread pizza I've had anywhere. There are so many flavors in this, it's definitely a must try.   Cheezy peezy: they aren't lying when they say this is cheesy. It was good, although I wish we had out style meat on it to go with all the cheese.  Yummus: your standard hummus appetizer. Was good, though the pita was a little to hard for my liking.   Bleu balsamic: steak and bleu cheese perfection! Tender cooked beef and sweet tomatoes and red onions to go with made this one of the favorites.   Black cherry soda: get it! It tastes like a slurpee but better!  This pace is amazing, I can't believe it took me so long to come here. I'll be here all the time now!",

That thing is quite delicious! The only complain is that I think it had a bit too much potatoes. Carb overload.  Also got a veggie healthy drinks, absolutely delicious. Can't remember the name of it, but I think it contains carrots, ginger, and celery, there are more for sure.  Also got a latte before I go, maybe I'm just very picky with coffee,  it's just not strong enough, maybe a bit too much milk.",

In other words, great food for any time of the day.   I always order from the skinny side, but tried the waffles and the pancakes from my niece n nephew. No surprise why they love them! One of their favorite foodie places too.    Had the Vegwich tonight and every part of it was yummy, but had a kick to it. Worth it for the taste. Favorite so far is the Wrap Supastar with eggs, avocado, and other yummy breakfast wrap stuff, and then the ahi srirrachi taco, which I got the first time and had several time since.   You won't be disappointed!",

It's very reminiscent of some coastal areas in California. There's is a walk up counter where you order and can get your drinks which include a number of delicious smoothies (served in reusable cups; a little nod to Mother Nature there), coffee, and beers ranging from PBR to Delirium Tremens. Talk about a range! Cucumber water is available gratis at the drink station.  Then there's the food. Split between two sides of the menu, one healthy and one decidedly not. There's something for everyone, and so far it's all be fantastic. Great staff, fun atmosphere, and always enough to fill you up.",

Love their soda options too! My husband got The Meltdown with Truffle fries. He loved it. We both loved the crispy flavorful truffle fries (dip those in that country gravy...killer!) So thankful they are in our neighborhood. Prices aren't too bad for the amount of food and the quality. Service was fast and friendly. Love the decor of the restaurant. There is even an outside patio, but you can only get there through the restaurant, so no dogs allowed I'm sure:( We will be returning!",

I definitely need to go again and if I order it again I will definitely add egg as a friend suggested.  The truffle fries were a bit disappointing. Reading the reviews were what sparked my interest to order it. Hopefully it was just a fluke but my order had very little truffle oil in it. I've used enough truffle out myself to know it. Flavor was faint and the smell was not there. Will definitely give it a try again next time I come.   Oh yes. The juices are always great!   And the second location has outside seating on the side of the building. Ideal location for summer outings. Shade! :-)",

I love Skinnyfats because they have tasty dishes for all my cravings and their fresh squeezed juice are also good. My favorite part of this place is how they divide their menu into two sides, happy and healthy. Happy is for those who aren't watching their calorie intake and healthy is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever I go I always get the liquid defense because it's very refreshing, and no matter what I have to get a side of their truffle fries. If you haven't tried this place then you're missing out. So I highly recommend stopping by and trying something new each time.",

You walk in, grab a menu (or use the menu over the counter), select what you want, order at the counter, received a number, and proceed to find a table. There's an indoor area as well as an outdoor area. The line to order can often be out the door. Next to the register, there is a screen that displays the various specials of the day. Be sure to check out the specials!  The prices are alright. It doesn't seem bad in relation to the quality and quantity you get.  For drinks, they do serve beer. They also have a variety of smoothies and juices, as well as natural sugar sodas. The black cherry soda is delicious!  Beware that there may be significant lag time between dishes arriving at your table. We had one arrive long before the rest. Like really long. The other dishes arrived separately too, but the time in between wasn't bad.  We tried a variety of food - chicken and waffles, red velvet waffle, buffalo chicken tenders with truffle fries, and their take on a Philly cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. The Philly cheesesteak was my favorite. It's got cherry peppers and banana peppers on it! And it has pepper jack cheese and cheese sauce. Yum, yum, yum! Even the roll is was on was delicious. I devoured the entire thing. The sweet potato fries were alright, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries.  In sum, we will be back. It is worth the drive from SE.",

We went to the Warm Springs location as it being a Saturday night we thought the Dean Martin location would probably be packed.  Upon entering, the wooden plank walls painted with brightly colored emojis and artwork greeted us and we got in line. Placing your order at the counter and getting a number, the servers will deliver food to the table.  The concept of SkinnyFats is a fun one; there's a \"healthy\" option and a \"happy\" option, meaning it might be higher in caloric count, however, most options I noticed were still healthy.  Items ranging from breakfast to lunch, burgers to omelets, salads to shakes, there's a nice variety to choose from.  Items ordered, classic burger with fries for the kids, Smoke in a Bowl for me (grilled chicken in a smoky BBQ sauce atop brown rice and veggies, add avocado, husband got S'motherload burrito. We also ordered a Defense juice with extra ginger, freshly juiced there as it is ordered. Everything was really good.  Total minus tip was $61.00.  The clerk said they are putting one over in  Henderson/Green Valley Ranch area and one in Summerlin soon.  Looking forward to visiting those locations.",

Their juices and smoothies are delish too-- recommend the Cucumber Strawberry smoothie for a hot day.  Seating is first come first serve. But please, don't save seats if you haven't ordered yet. I guarantee that a seat will be available for you once you're ready to eat since that's how the system of turnover seems to work. Plus there are communal tables and an outside patio that you can resort to.  Parking sucks. I park by CVS and just walk over.  There's also a location on Dean Martin by the strip. That place is tinier than this with less parking. Also, it's frequented more by tourists.",

My sandwich was cheesey and had a generous amount of meat. I loved the cheese sauce they put on top. They also gave a huge portion of fries.   They had a lemon blueberry cookie i wanted to try, but unfortunately they ran out of, so i ended up getting a salted caramel cookie. This cookie was crispy, chewy, and sweet all at the same time.   Skinnyfats is a great concept and i cant wait for them to expand to ca.",

The truffle fries were very good even though I feel truffle oil is overused by most places.   Really enjoyed it.  The only thing is there is a \"Skinny\" side to the menu for healthy eaters and a \"Happy\" side for those who like more fatty food.  However, it implies there are no skinny happy people.  They should call it the \"Fat\" side.  If the shoe fits.",

    "text": "We tried SkinnyFATS on Warm Springs tonight. I think the Healthy side, Happy side menu is a pretty clever concept. For those who have not been here what that means is the left side of the menu is healthy and the right side is happy. The dining room is really cool with a reclaimed wood look with visually interesting art. The pallet bar stools are cool too. There is also a nice size patio for outdoor seating.     Tonight we had the Caulifire appetizer. It's cauliflower in some sort of franks red hot type of sauce. Very tasty with just the right amount of kick. Next I had the Vegewich as my entree. It is a portobello mushroom sandwich on a wheat bun. It is vegan. Lettuce, tomato, avocado and some sort of vegan sauces dress it up and you get a choice of one side. I also ordered the Mean bean to take home and eat later. It is a veggie bean burger with lettuce, tomato, avocado and a spicy hummus dressing and choice of one side. I ended up eating half of each sandwich and taking home half of each. I am happy to say both were delicious and satisfying.     This is my 4th visit or so to SkinnyFATS and I will definitely be back again. Good job guys!!!",

The weather was really nice the day we went, and we were tempted to sit outside, but opted for an inside corner.   First time at this location, we decided to indulge and go for the 'Happy' side of the menu. Since it was still early, we were in the mood for breakfast. Top of the menu was the S'Motherload. Wow. We sort of glanced at the rest of the menu, but that one sounded amazing with filet mignon, sausage, potato, fajita pepper and topped with Cajun cheese sauce and pico. Yep, we chose that one. Oh, and there was a case of incredibly enticing cookies at the register, so I had to have one of those as well. Definitely going for the 'happy' menu here today.   As always, we split our meal. That might sound weird, but if we don't we are just too stuffed and miserable. Either that, or now we have to carry our food around with us while we run errands. Splitting works for us. Their soda was good. They serve Boylan sodas, which are made with pure cane sugar. It was a nice change from the 'usual' selections.   They brought out the burrito on a regular plate, no plastic or paper here! Real silverware was nicely wrapped and secured in a black napkin. They even brought out a second plate for when we split it. The burrito looked great, and tasted better! The tender pieces of meat and sausage were a bonus. The tortilla was nice and thin, not overwhelming like some places. So glad we tried this location, as the Dean Martin location is just too cramped for us, and also that we opted for the 'Happy' menu and not the 'Healthy'. So yummy!!!",

Loved how the fries were crispy and the burger didn't leave me feeling lazy. The sourdough was crispy (yes I love crispy things) and wasn't too spicy overall :)   For the limited space, there's a communal table that can seat a decent amount + outdoor seating. Everything on the menu looked tempting so I was torn between a couple...and don't forget the cookies by the register  definitely have to try one next time!!

This place ain't no salad dive. There's plenty of flavorful, savory but healthy foods on their menu.   My first time there, I ordered the Sweet Cheese Us and man oh man...sweet cheese us indeed. This is their version of a Philly but they made it their own with their pepper marmalade that gave it just enough heat to sting your lips but make you crave for more. The portobello mushrooms enhanced the flavors and gave the sandwich a more robust meaty taste and using pepper jack as one of the cheeses brought the sandwich to another dimension.  As my side I had truffle fries and I must say, these fries are to DIE FOR. The fries are not short from addictive. Each fry was full of the truffle flavor; from the first fry to the last. I've had truffle fries from other restaurants and the truffle taste seems to die down once you get to the bottom. Not these fries! Each fry was a delectable and delightful treat. I'd consider eating these instead of popcorn for a movie.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the meal and I am looking forward to exploring more items on their menu.",

I had a totally better experience today with the Warm Springs location compared to Dean Martin. My son ordered the Morning Mac (every 10 year old's favorite food) and loved it! He emphasized on how delicious the sourdough bits went with the mac & cheese. I gave the November Benny another try and it was made to perfection! The presentation was completely off last time but today, I was thoroughly impressed by how close it represented what I have seen on social media. Our food also came out in a very timely manner! The entire Warm Springs crew gave topnotch customer service and checked on us a couple of times after bringing our food out! After picking my son up from school, we surely had a great afternoon \"snack\" and a very pleasant experience with SkinnyFATS!  Thank you again Jennifer and the entire Warm Springs crew for your outstanding customer service after a not-so-great first experience. I have no regrets giving SkinnyFATS another try and will definitely be visiting the Warm Springs location again soon!",

It's all delicious and the best part is, you can order from both sides!  DRINK Fresh pressed juices are delicious and not crazy expensive either.  SERVICE Joyful and friendly.  AMBIANCE It's a walk-up-and-order and you sit down with a number type of place so inherently casual. Nice wood interior with interesting grafitti style art on the walls. There's an outdoor patio too. It kind of looks like a cool cafeteria or coffee shop. Great for families or friends.",

They don't have any vegetarian tacos, but at the last minute I figured It doesn't hurt to ask. They offer breakfast options with potatoes so I asked if they could make potato tacos. The girl up front asked the chef and he not only offered to make potato tacos, but suggested cauliflower tacos if I wanted.   I tried one of each and they were both delicious! I love a place that is willing to make customers happy. And delicious vegetarian food definitely makes me happy. Thank you SF!",

    "text": "When you're at Skinny Fats, you've entered the ultimate temptation. Your mind is telling you to go for the Skinny but at the same time you're tempted to choose Fats. So you stand there ideally looking at the menu hoping to narrow it down to at least two entrees but it's difficult. As you near the cashier, you're really pressured to select the ultimate meal that highlights your night. And that's exactly how I found myself being in love with their chicken waffles.   Uhm, yes. I've succumbed to the dark side with chicken, waffles, and syrup, synchronized together into one perfect bite. I'm a huge fan and while it's been a while since I've last visited, I am also tempted to purchase a smoothie to go. And pretty much everything they offer. Seriously, just give them all to me.   The service here is always friendly. I remember going on 4-20 and they were offering cookies. As if you need more reason to like them, right? It just keeps getting better.    Also, my girlfriend is a big fan of their burgers. She can't get enough of how delicious they are. I often make fun of her because she always says that she'll get a bowl but right when she gets to the counter, she immediately changes her mind as though getting something other than a burger is a sin. But I mean, I can't blame her. They are pretty damn delicious.   One other thing I like about this place is that they are vegetarian friendly. I love how they have a few meals on the menu so our vegetable-loving friends can also have something here too!   I'm definitely coming back here sometime soon. A real Las Vegas treasure, for sure.",

I had no idea what to order when our friend took us here but the cashier was super friendly and helpful and had a few recommendations. She also let us try some sort of slushy drink as well which was nice of her.   I ended up ordering the \"Avocatoast\" which is essentially Avocado toast because I am a basic millenial trying to be healthy. Even though this was a very simple dish, it was one of the best I had during our trip to vegas. The avocado toast was delicious: it was piled high with guacamole on a perfectly toasted toast and topped with feta cheese and a fried egg. It was also surprisingly filling and didn't make me feel overly stuffed.   They have all day breakfast which is a bonus. They have everything on this menu from chicken and waffles to burritos to tacos and soups and they pretty much have the \"indulgent\" and healthy version of every dish.   What's pretty cool is that they have a raw juice bar connected to their restaurant! What is pretty cool is that you can either order one of their drink combos or customize your own! I don't remember what I got but I remember it was refreshing. The staff here is super friendly and I would go back here the next time I am in town.",

When you go in, you order like up front like at chipotle. Then they give you a number and you take a seat then they bring you the food!  Ambiance was nice, the food came out fast and it was really good. Servers were courteous too!  They also were giving out gluten free vegan red velvet cakes for their 5th anniversary and since it was my birthday dinner that was really appreciated!",

We also ordered the steak sandwich (something cheese us, can't remember the name) with truffle fries which was really good. Really enjoyed the cheese sauce on there. I'd def go back! We also took some cookies to go, always need road trip snacks.",

    "text": "Not a fan of the potential long lines that you may encounter at SkinnyFATS.  But after a trip to their original location and seeing that unappetizing long line and no seats, I decided to check out their second location.  The line was still long, but it was not as bad as the first one, plus the seating capacity is much improved here.  The menu looks identical, so unless I am deathly close to their first location, I will likely never go back there again.  If you can order online, that will probably be very helpful in saving time as well.  Service from the cashier and order taker was good.  The staff that delivered our order was also good.  Once you place and pay for your order, you are given a number, so your order can be brought out to wherever you find available seating, both indoor and out in the patio area. The weather was nice, and the building provided sufficient protection from the sun, so we eventually made our way out to the open table we found.  Eating out in the patio area felt like having a picnic outdoor, complete with the baby or fruit flies that wants to partake in the meal as well.  After looking over the menu, we decided to order the following:  Ahi Srirachi Taco: Seared Ahi, Slaw Chee, Mango, Pico & Spicy Yo-Aioli in a Wheat Soft Taco.  My Fav Asian liked it and that's all I needed to know.  She did add more habanero hot sauce to her tacos for more fiery kick. *Did they misspelled Sriracha on purpose?  Ahi Taco-San: Tempura Ahi, Sriracha Slaw, Mango Pico, Teriyaki, Spicy Aioli in a Puffed Shell.  This one is a winner, but probably not one of their relatively healthier menu items.  It is messy to eat, but I can't complain with the paper napkins within easy reach.  4.5 stars worthy all on its own.  Cherry Popper: 1/2 lb. Beef Patty, Cherry/Banana Peppers, Spicy Slaw, Pepper Jack & Fried Egg on a Hawaiian Roll with a side (Opted for the Truffle Fries).  Not sure why it gets positive reviews.  I thought it was just average or maybe the execution was just off.  Asked for medium rare, was served a burger closer to well done (it was still juicy and not dried).  The Hawaiian Roll did nothing for me in this burger, as it was not toasted and was way too soft and soggy after all the liquid from the slaw got absorbed into the bun.  I will pass on this one and done burger.  The Truffle Fries was okay. At $3.5 per order it is not expensive, but again the execution felt subpar. Half of my fries look and tasted overcooked (the ones on the bottom covered up by fresher, acceptably executed batch of fries), as if it was the last of the leftover fries scooped up from the fryer just before it has no wiggle room left to go except the trash and served all on my plate with the Cherry Popper Burger.  Not even close to McD's fries.  If I was not already in a good mood just spending the day hanging out with my Fav Asian, the rating would not be so generous to even earn the A-OK 3 stars.",

    "text": "i was a bit confused as to why this place is called \"Skinny Fats\" thinking everything will be healthy much like \"LYFE Kitchen.\" I learned from the cashier  that for every food item, they provide the \"skinny\" (healthy) versus \"fat\" (happy) version of the same dish. At least, that's what I think the girl was saying...  Great thing is you can get breakfast all day here and i was craving for some waffles and fried chicken at 10p.m.   CHICK-A-WAFF-A-DOPOLIS -- 1 star.  Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don't know if they bake it or how they seasoned the breading for the chicken tenders, but I didn't enjoy the flavor one bit. I ate 1 out of 5 chicken strips. The waffle was also an OK. I asked them  if it was some type of \"skinny\" recipe because it lacked in flavor and texture was a bit odd. Apparently, I was eating regular buttermilk waffles. Looking back, it may have been that I didn't get to slab on a ton of butter like the True fattie way of life, and dunk it in some full fat maple syrup. Hey, if I'm going to order off the \"FAT\" side of the menu, I'm gong to go big or go home.   THE ORIGINAL burger - 4.5 star.  I don't know if it's cuz I was eating some mediocre chicken strips and waffles immediately prior, this burger made my night. I was confused once again, what was \"healthy\" 'till my brain kicked in and I realized this item was listed under the \"FATS\" (or \"happy?\") section. Hence, it's a NORMAL burger, with bacon, sauce, cheese, and avocado on a brioche bun.   Truffle fries- 1 star. Is this supposed to be the \"fat\" version, because it sure tasted like a \"skinny,\" i.e. not as good as what fries or better yet, truffle fries normally taste.   Service- Great cashiers that are super enthusiastic to be working there.   So...I'm still a bit confused about the SkinnyFATS concept. There's a lot of semantics going on with them interchangeably replacing the words \"skinny\" with \"healthy\" and \"fat\" with \"happy.\" So wait, the \"skinny\" stuff makes one healthy, but not happy?  I went through a whirlwind of confused states trying to make sense of what was going on when I was ordering, and it continued to persist as I ate parts of my meal.    On a brighter note, I guess I can share a meal at the same restaurant with my vegan, vegetarian, \"skinny,\" and \"healthy\" friends while I shamefully order from the \"fat\" menu and stay \"happy.\"   Speaking for myself, I'd go somewhere else to eat a healthy meal, because it's just too dang tempting to see the non-healthy options alongside. And as for eating some fatty, happy, meals, I'd go somewhere else to \"get my fattie on.\"",

My friend ordered a fried chicken sandwich and only ate the top bun and fries. Not even the chicken or bacon....

    "text": "I was split between Holsteins Shakes and Buns or SkinnyFATS for a Sunday dinner. A friend who came from out of town decided we tried SkinnyFATS. We both never had dine in either places. So, it didn't matter which place, but pics for SkinnyFATS on Yelp   were enticing!   We came in and line was just starting to get busy at around 6pm. I ordered the Chix on Broadway with a side of truffle fries. Our order came in a timely manner. I was first impressed that the chicken to bread ratio was pretty darn good! The breaded chicken breast was huge than normal. It was also very moist.   However, taste was not there. To me, the breaded chicken was bland. The toppings that came with the Chix on Broadway were BLT, cheddar, red onion, and lemon herb aioli. All these toppings didn't help with the chicken being bland. Also, I prefer my bacon cooked crispy. I don't know if they cook their bacon not crispy all the time. Hey, but it's an easy fix! Ask to cook it crispy then?  I chose the truffle fries as my side that came with the meal. The fries were served barely warm and the fries were not the best I've had. Overall, I will try SkinnyFATS again for a second visit. I hope to come in when they are not that busy. The staff was friendly and helpful. Till then, hope to update for a better review and choose other creative selections on their menu :)",

    "text": "On the way to a friend's house who lives way out in the boonies (because Fort Apache is literally that far from where I live), I screamed \"THERE'S SKINNYFATS!!\" when I sighted this highly rated eatery. Luckily for me, my husband and I were both starving.   Customer service is amazing! Right when we walked in a barrage of cheerful greetings were launched at us. The cashier was quite chipper and gave a quick overview of the rather large menu. I think my husband was overwhelmed by all the options, but decided on the Cherry Popper Burger after the cashier recommended it. I ordered the Veg-TO-Bowl. Wait time was about 7 minutes for the food.    HELPFUL TIP: Check out the menu beforehand online at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fskinnyfats.com%2Fskinnyfats-menu%2F&s=ca5e3d58b51afeb139a7eabebebc24241cc6fbc07ee99026ebdb4ee77c9b2292\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">skinnyfats.com/skinnyfat...</a> The menu at the restaurant doesn't have pictures and there's just so many options it's hard to know where to start. The online menu will better assist you in picking your order.  CHERRY POPPER BURGER ($12): This burger ain't kidding around. Topped with a fried egg and served on a Hawaiian roll bun, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Plus, it's gargantuan size is enough to intimidate the bravest of burger lovers. My husband enjoyed his burger but didn't care for the cherry/banana peppers inside. He said he wouldn't order it again on a return visit.  TRUFFLE FRIES: These fries were included with the burger. I only managed to nab 2 or 3, but we both liked these flavorful fries.   VEG-TO-BOWL ($9): I ordered this because the ingredient combination was creative. The bowl consisted of bell peppers, tofu, and random pineapple pieces served on top of a shallow bed of \"portobello fried rice\". Teriyaki sauce and aioli sauce was layered on top of the bowl.   I though I would like the pineapple but it turns out the flavor just threw me off. The tofu was the super soft and squishy kind. I wish there was more rice and more tofu in the bowl. The dominating ingredient were the bell peppers. This entree made me super thirsty! I think it was the aioli sauce. I wouldn't get the Veg-TO-Bowl again. It was good but not good enough to get it twice!  FOUNTAIN DRINKS($2-3): The soda at SkinnyFats is made with cane sugar. This soda is probably the best I've ever had. I had their equivalent of a Coke. My husband tried the root beer, which was also spectacular. The cups they give you are actually reusable! If you keep the cup, on your next visit you'll save $0.50 for a drink.               PRICING: A meal for two came to $27 and some change. We weren't expecting that high of a price tag! There's also a tip section on the receipt after you pay at the register....  ATMOSPHERE: Totally trendy, but I love it! I seen a real live hipster on the premises. Tapered beard, curled up mustache, too tight clothes - the whole sha-bang.   Return Visit? Yes! It just likely won't be in the near future since both SkinnyFats locations are sooooo far away from I live/work.  :(  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #20",

    "text": "Their concept is creative. It's just like their name sounds- SkinnyFats... half of the menu serving up \"skinny\"  or healthy themed options- with the other half of the menu serving up \"fat\" or guilty pleasure themed options.   Here is what I've tried on my two visits..    Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis Bomb Diggity Sandwich  Liquid Defense Juice   First Visit... My husband I both ordered the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis and were both underwhelmed with this option. It was just alright and we both thought it was a bit bland. I guess we were expecting a more elevated version of this dish. I also ordered a juice to go since we were in and out in a hurry. The juice ended up being my favorite of the above items. I really like the 'Liquid Defense' which was a blend of orange, lemon, lime, basil, carrot, and apple. This was my first time trying basil in a juice and I really enjoyed the herbal kick it added.   Second Visit... I decided to come back and try something else with a co-worker for lunch. He ordered  the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (against my advice)  and I ordered the Bomb Diggity, My sandwich was served on toasted sourdough bread with thick crispy bacon. I ended up adding avocado to it. Avocado makes everything better. I liked my sandwich and he liked the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis with extra syrup (which just shows you that everyone can have a different experience with the same dish- it just wasn't my thing).  The decor and vibe is super laid back and casual. It has a funky and artsy twist to a casual cafe. They have a sweet outdoor patio to soak up our Las Vegas sunshine and one can't help but smile when you enter their cafe. The service has been was warm, friendly, and welcoming when ordering at the counter. The staff was eager to suggest items to try. Overall, I really like the concept  will be back to get more Liquid Defense and sample other items off their \"Skinny\" menu.",

    "text": "skinnyFATS a contradiction in itself is a restaurant that offers healthy or \"soul food.\" So depending if you don't mind gaining a little fat or if you're trying to slim down and eat healthy, this place has those options.  Juice: They offer juices ranging from your typical all veggie green concoction to your regular fruit drink.  A bit overpriced for a $9 juice when you can get a entree from around that price.   Food: The cherry popper is all you need to know.  A nice juicy burger that sits on two hawaiian buns that also comes with a side.    Overall: After working out I'm always too tired to go home and make something so if you're looking for clean eats after a workout or if you just want something tasty, come on over to skinnyFATS",

Even the dishes that I thought wouldn't be good are delicious, like when you try a bite of your husband's disgusting sounding order but you end up wanting to order it next time for yourself. They have their own line of soda too. The Birch Rootbeer is really really good. It's like a spicier regular rootbeer. If you like rootbeer try it, you will love it. The price is a little higher than some near by places like Robertos and the such but you are paying for quality. They really are a great, unique restaurant.",

I cannot even fathom my excitement when I found out a SkinnyFATS was being opened on the Southwest part of the Valley not to mention this location was going to be almost TWICE as big.  The menu hasn't changed, but the decor definitely has improved. There's an outside seating area and a cool \"high table\" where the chairs are made of crates and pillows are stacked on. This place is definitely a good date night location especially if you're able to land a table outside because of the lights. If you're not a fan of the outside, don't worry.. You can seat yourself inside in front of their huge projector television screening.  I love this restaurant and will return shortly.

The fries were terrible. They were old and almost stale the only fries that tasted like truffle were at the bottom which leads me to believe the just poured a little on top and didn't toss them. Truffles didn't have a strong smell or taste so im guessing it was any eye drops worth..   I don't know why people flock here because their door is open you have to eat your food fast or its cold. I'm assuming because half the people I see walking in the door are women and half those women are overweight... So put skinny or False sense of healthy in the name and you've made a hot spot for certain women. Smh",

Next time I went there I decided to go for the pancakes with Brie, strawberries and balsamic dressing. Sorry guys, I will not be ordering this again, for me, that mix did not go well together. I usually do like mixing salty and sweet but this was a miss, at least for me. I think something broke in the kitchen that day because the fries did not have the same taste as the first time and my husband's meal (he ordered the same thing as the last time) was subpar.

This place has great personality and character. Brilliant concept of the names and the healthy vs. happy menus.

I only come to SkinnyFats for the Apollo Fries, they went off the menu for a while now but the location on Dean Martin would always make it for me anyway. I go to this location and felt like I broke the whole flow of the food establishment.   They initially told me they won't make it but I argued that I had it made for me many times even though it was not on the menu. (By the way I think it is ridiculous that this is off the menu because you guys still have all the ingredients for it) They finally decide to make it, got it to-go, I get back at work and see just PLAIN FRIES. Lol, after the fiasco with ordering the fries they still made it wrong. Are these two places not owned by the same person? I know it is so why does this crew seem way less educated about the food than the others.. Not happy with this location at all.",

    "text": "This is an interesting concept - a smart casual restaurant that has a healthy side and a happy side of a menu.   I came here with my girlfriend and a friend, and we had a few things. We split an order of the Cauliflower with Buffalo Sauce. I had the Smoke in a Bowl, which was chicken with a BBQ flavor, peppers, pineapple, over brown rice.   The food was pretty decent, but I'm docking a few stars for a couple reasons. One, I ordered my Smoke in  a Bowl without the chopped onion, which they not only forgot, but when the waiter brought it out, I mentioned \"I ordered this without onion\", not only did he not take it back to fix it, he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away.   Second, if you are going to advertise and claim to be a healthy restaurant, I would think you would do the obvious and put basic nutritional information on the menu, or even your website. Nothing. Not posted anywhere obvious. So while you claim that food is healthy, there is nothing to help you choose wisely particularly if you are tracking calorie consumption.",

    "text": "Hello, today I visited SkinnyFATS for the first time.  I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.  The customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.  SkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service.",

First off the servings are pretty small according to their price, but I thought eh that's all \"healthy\" food joints. I got the chicken and waffles the healthy version, and the \"nutella\" shake that tasted nothing like nutella lol. Anyways, it was all okay, tasted good, but just not filling enough.  The worst part was that I went with my brother and his gf and we all got different things but each a shake and the next day we were all in the bathroom to say the least. I'm assuming it was old milk or something because that was the only thing we all got and we were all sick the next day. Not worth returning.",

It was drenched in sauce and the rice was under cooked. I think what upsets me more than the bad meal is the fact that no one checked on us. The restaurant was well over staffed, and no one checked on us at all. I ate 2 bites exactly, one piece of cauliflower  and one forkful of rice. My husband  took it up to them as we were leaving they offered to remake it but at that point I want to go find something else to eat. I didn't even receive a refund which seems like the easiest thing. I have eaten at the other location and enjoyed it. I won't be back to this location the lack of customer service is a deal breaker.",

I've only ordered off of their healthy side, but everything that comes out of the kitchen looks great.  I wish they had a couple more salads on the menu, because they understand the concept of high quality greens & salad dressings, and don't drown the salads with the dressing.    I was all set to give it 5 stars.  However, this last visit, I made the mistake of showing up at lunch time.  The inefficiency was hard to watch.  I used to go to a similar size restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating in San Francisco which also had just one cash register going, and delivered the food to the tables via number.  Night and day difference in terms of getting customers through the process from arrival to departure in a timely manner.  Skinnyfats has a salad called the slow boat to china - we were all making jokes that the line should be called the slow boat to skinnyfats.   .  Will be back - just not at peak times.",

The girl behind the counter explained how you can order on the one side which is the healthy side and the other side you live happy!   I guess we were both in the mood to live happy.  My husband ordered the Waffle and Chicken and I had the Hot Chix Salad, Wow when they were both brought out we could not wait to try!!  My husband really enjoyed his. He had never had Chicken and waffles together so this was a treat for him. He let me try his and I thought the Chicken was so tender and the breading was amazing. I could go just for these!  My salad was really good. It had the buffalo chicken on top of lettuce which was really tender and lightly battered it was slightly crispy along with blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes, Avocado and fried Jalapenos.   Omg the fried Jalapenos I could make a lunch out of them by them selves!!! They were lightly battered and crispy and not spicy at all but the flavor was amazing! I am so hooked on them I want more now! :) I can not stress enough how good they were!  It was served with a Jalapeno ranch dressing that had a little kick to it and a perfect touch to the salad. The only complaint I have is I think it needed a tad bit more lettuce under it. There is a lot of toppings but not much lettuce. Otherwise it was very good.  The concept of this place is great. You are sure to find something you want to eat! So many different items on the menu which is cool.   We both agreed we really enjoyed it and are looking forward to going again sometime.   We highly recommend this place!! It is VERY good,  We had the coffee which was good a long with flavored creamers. After our breakfast/lunch we bought one warm chocolate chip cookie which came out warm and the chocolate was soft and the cookie was very good! A great way to end the meal!  We are fans for sure! And will go back. If you have never been here stop and check it out. We left just in time there was a ton of people going in as we left and not a table to be had. So you may want to go early or after the lunch crowd.",

    "text": "First I want to start by saying that I actually like the food at SkinnyFATS, this is more about the service. This was not the first time I've had an issue with a to go order at this location. If you're eating there, you should be fine.   Had a 15 minute drive home and called to place an order for pickup. Clarissa answered the phone and asked to place me on hold for a minute. Pretty standard so far. As I continue to drive, I think to myself \"geez I've been on hold for a long time.\" Before you know it I've arrived at SkinnyFATS and they still have not come back on the phone. I check my phone and I see it's already been over a 15 minute phone call. Wonderful!   As I drive past the front door, I see that the store is pretty busy, but not a single soul in line! That's pretty infuriating to put it mildly. I consider going inside while still on hold, and getting in line to place an order and tell them \"seems it was faster to drive 15 min here and order in person instead of calling in an order!\" Ultimately, I decide to just leave as I wouldn't even enjoy my meal from here today.   As I pull out of the plaza and I'm about to hang up, Clarissa comes back on the phone \"thank you for holding, can I get your name for the order?\" I say \"no thanks! That was pretty long hold. I just drove by your store and there wasn't a single person in line! So that's pretty upsetting.\" To which she replies \"there must have been some mix up in the order of the phone calls.\" Seems more likely I was forgotten about on hold, cuz how many phone calls were \"mixed up\" ahead of me for 15 minutes???  I end up hanging up and drive home hungry and upset. Not sure if I'm ever going back to this SkinnyFATS.",

    "text": "I'm not sure I'm on the hype train, but SkinnyFATS was very good. The menu had a lot more options than initially expected and ranged from healthy to greasy. Prices were very much on the high side but the quality is right on line. Portion sizes are a little small for the prices as well which hurts my review of the restaurant.   I had the bbq chicken bowl with brown rice and pineapple. It was a delicious dish and pretty filling considering it was pretty low calorically.   I might come back because it is becoming a Vegas staple with the health phase zooming into sight in the area. And it's close to my work which is a plus. The lines are a little longer than most lunch places but that should be accepted in the area with only so many local options to choose from.",

The rice was soooooooo undercooked that it tasted as if it were picked straight from the rice fields in rural china and just thrown onto the plate. Cooking rice is a basic skill and they managed to mess it up. Second, they drowned my bowl in teriyaki sauce. The bowl overall was too sweet and made me lose my appetite.

Service was perfectly friendly and the bussers come quickly and often to clear the tables.   Food:  I had the Smoke in a Bowl (\"smokin a bowl\"?), which was good and flavorful. My boyfriend had the cranburkey burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was a little dry, but with some of that delicious jalapeno ketchup was very good. Both items came from the \"healthy\" side of the menu, but I don't think either of them was really that healthy. I think in the future, I'll probably just give in and go for the \"happy\" side.   It's a little pricey, but the portions are well-sized and tastes good.",

    "text": "It's taken me awhile to visit this location - and the moment I did, I came back 2 days later because it was that good. Located conveniently off Durango and 215, this place offers the same healthy and happy foods for those of you who live on the westside, without having to drive over to Dean Martin. A few months ago when I found out some of my favorites were going to be cut from the menu, I was a bit sad, but eating here recently confirms that those cuts allowed them to really focus on their current menu offerings and really improve them. Some of my favorite items are the Wrap Supastar - healthy, but delicious take on a breakfast wrap. The chicken is unbelievably not dry and the produce they use was so fresh. For those of you looking to be happier and splurging, get the Steak Eyes for breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are so much better than the standard fare you get at any old regular breakfast spot. Their cold press juices are also well made and come in reusable, dishwasher safe containers. There's also a patio out here that makes you feel like you aren't in the middle of a strip mall and a drugstore is just right across the street - very well done! My couple of gripes - my chocolate chip cookie was harder than usual, instead of chewy like I'm used to at Dean Martin location, and headlights of cars parking right in front are pretty blinding. Otherwise, very friendly and helpful staff and very clean and appetizing place!  Pro Tip: ask for their homemade sriracha mayo to dip your fries in.",

    "text": "It's with a heavy heart that I write this review as I was a fan of skinny fats for a couple of years. As of late they have had a few issues with their food which is very disappointing. Again my wife and I worked late shifts and did not feeling like cooking today. We decided on skinny fats for breakfast but also decided we would just bring it home as we were both tired. I ordered the Smotherload breakfast burrito which I have had numerous times while I dined in restaurant. My wife decided on the protein waffle with fresh berries and agave syrup. We also ordered 2 waffles for her brother , one buttermilk and one protein which while eating in restaurant have been great. Nice and crisp, fruit was delicious. Today was the complete opposite. My burrito was a good size unfortunately it was cold and as I cut into the middle found that there was mid rare meat. I don't mind that as much I as did finding a piece of raw chicken in my burrito. Chicken is not an ingredient that was listed in this meal, much less raw. My wife's waffles were soggy to say the least, chewy, and the fruit looked to be on its last legs. It's seems as if you order takeout from skinny fats, it is not the same as when you eat in. The consistency of their kitchen makes me believe that some of them may need to be retrained so that they all have the same look, taste, and recipe. I have noticed in the last 3 months that my meal always looks different depending on what time of day I go in. I understand that to go orders don't always hold up that well, but considering I live less than 5 min from the restaurant, it shouldn't have gotten cold and the waffles if cooked at the correct temperature should not have gotten soggy. The saving grace from a one star review is their cold press juice. It was flavorful and nice and convenient in to go bottles. Unfortunately I wasted it as due to the raw poultry and the over drenched burrito in cheese sauce. ( word of advice, in a to go order never cover in a fresh cheese sauce. It will get cold and congeal). I have been sick and have not been able to hold in anything since eating today. I know this sounds like I'm just an angry customer who wants to complain. Reality is I'm a chef of 17 years, and as much as it pains me to put down a locals place. Knowing that they are heading in the wrong direction and hoping they may take this review as serious as it.  Follow up:   As a follow up to my review I would like to thank skinny fats as a company for reaching out to me and taking care of me as a valued customer. Skinny Fats corporate reached out in a very professional and prompt manner and was very apologetic which is absolutely amazing. Most companies just take the review with a grain of salt and move on. Jennifer actually wanted to make me feel valued and offered a very nice way to do so.   Thank you very much Jennifer and all the skinny fats family for making me feel appreciated and offering to make thing right by me. Very much appreciated. I will definitely be updating my star count and speaking with others that have had the same issues. Just as long as they follow through with what they have offered.",

It's an \"order and seat yourself\" and they bring it to your table-works well. It's usually busy but can always find a table in this very casual establishment.  The atmosphere is lively and you can also dine on the small outside patio when it's not 100 degrees.  The Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will try something different to experience more of the unique menu next time...perhaps.",

We usually order the ahi taco and the tu-nuts.cucumbed boat and the Teri ahi sandwich. We love ahi but this time we aren't even sure if it was ahi. It was barely edible. Tough chewy fish. Not up to their usual standards. We will prolly give them one more chance at the Decatur location but then that's it. Customer gone. And I promote restaurants I love for free. Pls don't ruin it. Pls pay attention to the quality of your ingredients",

Wasn't disappointed, but def not five star worthy in my opinion. Staff was very friendly and environment was welcoming.",

We also got the summer quench juice which was delicious it was tart and refreshing with a little zing!  I ordered the messy fries or something like that...the steak was super tender and I had cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese crumbles and added avocado they don't give you much but it's good! We really enjoyed this place and will certainly be back to have one of those cucumber boats and more juices!!!",

It had an immenseful amount of sauce, yet the sauce was almost glued onto the chicken strip, which helped the chicken keep its crispy crunch in every bit, and still each bit had plenty of sauce, flavor, and moistness from how well it was cooked. The truffle fries that came with it was seasoned with parsley I believe, and then something else that I can't put my finger on. The mystery flavor was a bit distracting to each bit of the fries as it was like a layer of sugar or seasoning or something, on the fries, along with the parsley. But in all, the food was amazing, the environment was warm and very friendly.",

She asked what else he might like and quickly exchanged his order. He was so pleased! Because of Nikki we will be back soon and often!! Better hold onto her before someone steals her away!!",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant for the first time, was so happy with the menu and the service will go back and recommend it to everyone.  It has such a fun menu, a healthy side and a happy side, each menu item corresponds with a matching item with the opposite side.  You can pick a healthy entree and a happy side, that is what I did.  My friend had the chicken and waffles and said they were delicious.  The place was decorated so nicely, they have a really cute patio area outside too.  The place was busy, but they had plenty of help for everyone and they were so friendly, this was the Warm Springs location.  It would be so easy to go there if you were on a strict diet or a veggie.  Try it out and enjoy",

You even have a view of airplanes taking off and landing if you sit at the bar. They also have a a healthy menu, and a not so healthy menu, which is fun. Everything I've had on their menu is good, so try it all!",
