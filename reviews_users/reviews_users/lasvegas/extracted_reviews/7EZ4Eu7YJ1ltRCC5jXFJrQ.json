    "text": "Horrible all around! I paid $30 for the champagne brunch and the champagne was the only thing my body could stomach. everything tasted like cafeteria food, very starchy, very bland and over greassed. I felt in disbelief that EVERYTHING could be horrible so I continued to try more items, it kept getting worse. I feel bad leaving such bad comments but as Im on vacation spending my hard earned money I felt I was owed my money back cause I didn't even eat a plate let alone a meal. I ended up leaving and spending another $10 at the pizzeria next door. My lesson was well learned, as I might stay at treasure island again I will never purchase the buffet in their casino ever again. Hope you guys do something to make your food more desirable because I myself am actually not a picky eater.",

First of all, you are forced to line up outside and the line to be seated moves really slowly for no apparent reason. As you are in this line, you can plainly see that the majority of the tables are empty. I don't know what the logic is there, but it was pretty annoying. Also, it was something like $22 a head for the breakfast buffet. I realize it's Vegas and all but that seemed over the top. I would recommend going somewhere else!",

(Bellagio was $48.99 pp for their buffet) The pasta and salad station were fresh and made to order. By far the best part of the buffet was the dessert spread. A wide variety of cupcakes, cake, chocolate covered strawberries and mini doughnuts. I would go back based on the dessert alone.",

Visibly we could see a table seating 4 and 6 next to each other, so we expected to be seated near each other. Instead they separated our parties and said we could not sit in the tables next to each other without the 18%. The tables were not even touching! They were 3 feet apart. We were not going to join the tables. Worst customer service I've experienced at a Vegas restaurant! EVER! And I visit this city 6 times a year. I now know why this restaurant has 2.5 stars on Yelp.",

    "text": "Ok, I want to give this place 1.5 stars BUT they don't have that option.  Our waitress was great, but the food sucked - sorry :-(. Mostly Chinese fast-food type (and I'm Chinese..wanted to try something more 'American') so a lot of the food looked like Panda Express.  Salads/pastas can be intimidating because you literally have to choose your own ingredients to make your own salad/pasta. This is good and bad. Considering it's a buffet, it usually is better to showcase appealing (or at least try to) pre-made food. It's bad for those who don't know what the heck to put and I just decided to mix in all the ingredients together. BAD choice.  My parents don't speak English so it was very hard for them to order any salad/pastas. Wish it was in a 'bar' instead.   The only beef there was pre-sliced beef! Buffets in Vegas are known for their beef tripe or whatever where the 'chef' stands there and slices it for you. The turkey was already pre-sliced too. :-(  The crab legs are ok - had better ones elsewhere and they were too salty - maybe it is to hide the 'freshness' of the crab legs?  The only good meat were the pork ribs and bbq sauce - tender and yummy!!  The mini donuts were cute! But they were stale :-(.  Desert area was also lacking.  We paid $26.99 for each adult (weekend dinner price) and it was too overpriced! We waited in line for 40 minutes... AND I saw there were lots of seats inside, they just didn't have enough waiters I guess.",

Brunch is very basic with eggs, bacon, sausage,hash etc.  Omelette bar is great!  egg whites ftw!  The omelette station turns into the pasta station after 4pm.  Salad bar is pretty cool but very simplistic.  I tried the bbq cobb salad /w extra avocado.  If not for the extra avo, the salad would be pretty blah.  There's a bbq station serving pork ribs and that is actually kind of tasty.  Prime rib is terrible and so is the sushi.  Dessert spread is pretty bad too.  I'm starting to reconsider this above average rating.  The seafood spread is your average peel and eat shrimp and above average sized snow crab legs.  The crab legs were actually semi fresh, cold and sweet.  I like!  Orange juice is fake powdered stuff, stay away!",

Very little variety, flavors bland or non-existent, food overcooked. Strike one!   My hubby and son love red meat and couldn't find a single slice of prime rib that wasn't well done from being stacked on top of each other in the warming tray. Strike two!

All the other pre-made foods were either cold or hardened.   On a bright note, dishes that were prepared in front of you were pretty delish. The pasta station makes a nice fettucini alfredo, lobster ravioli, or pesto tortellini with sundried tomatos. Or the salad bar tosses out a decent looking/tasting salad. Or the soup bar mixes together a decent-for-buffet pho or wonton soup.  On an even brighter note, their dessert bar is AWESOME. I spent 50% of my time on this bar. Chocolate covered strawberries, cakes, ice creams, puddings, and cupcakes come standard. They ALSO have eclairs, FRUIT CUPS, COTTON CANDY, and MINI DONUTSSSSSSSSS (with chocolate glaze, maple glaze, brown sugar coated, powered, plain... you get the point).

I won't give it 5 stars because the staff was initially very rude to us. we had some friends who were supposed to come join us later, bringing our crew from 6 to 9 or 10, and they UTTERLY REFUSED to clear aside an adjacent table for our additional comrades, saying something about \"stations\" not being open. by \"stations\" I think they meant tables.  there were maybe ten tables occupied in the whole restaurant, so that is about 20% occupancy. WHAT THE CRAP, Mirror Universe employees? in the end it turned out that those additional people flaked out on us, so minus 50 points to them as well (ah, if only Yelp let you rate friends), but still, there was no reason for this behavior.  the guy who got us drinks was nice though.  so, in closing: food is worth 4 stars, staff is a 3; I'm rounding down to a 3. I'd go back, but would seriously consider giving a firm slap upside the head to an employee who gives me flak; next time I won't go right after my flight in. NEXT TIME THE FLEET WILL NOT EXIT HYPERSPACE SO SOON!",

I really wanted to carry it out with me, as cotton candy seems like a walking activity, but alas, no could do.  Most memorable thing was gnocchi with pesto. Pesto was super delicious and made to order.  The sushi bar is, as you would expect it. Fish is B grade at best, but wasn't horrible, on par with grocery store sushi.  It was about $50 for 2 for dinner. I only ate probably $15 at most, I failed at gluttony but made up for it with booze.  Probably wouldn't return but it was alright.",

Of all the stations, the home cooking station probably had the best food. -As usual, the asian section was a big disappointment, stay away from them if you go to buffets. you can get better asian food going straight to a restaurant.  -Desserts: They have a cotton candy machine which i love! i can't get enough of it! they also make their own mini doughnuts and they are quite tasty!! =) The cupcakes, cakes and cookies are ok/decent. Nothing to really write home about.   Overall, not that bad of a buffet, but not the best. The Wynn and Wicked Spoon buffets are by far the best ones i have been to.",

PRO TIP: grab an extra cupcake at the end of your visit and pretend like you are eating it on your way out, then save it for later.

The Buffet at Treasure Island fit the bill of your average, run of the mill buffet.    I would suggest ordering your food from the pasta station.  That way your food is freshly prepared and exactly what you want.  The gentleman working the pasta buffet when I was there was very talented and whipped me up a tasty seafood ravioli dish and made sure I even got fresh bread on the side.    I did really enjoy the dessert table.  Everything I got was tasty--and I got a LOT of dessert!  I had to grab a thing of cotton candy because it would make a cute picture (think of me how you wish, but what is more adorable than a cotton candy selfie?!).  Anyway, the cotton candy was grape flavored!  I am normally not a huge cotton candy person, but we ate the whole thing!  Try it out for something different :)",

All I saw was like 2 different salad bars? They barely have much selections already and you need 2 different salad bars? I mean they had different types of salads that they would mix for you making it fancy and all but really...2 different salad bars?  The kind of selections they had was not much different than your traditional hometown buffet or golden corral buffet chains. Ok fine, maybe their pasta selections made to order was better but that's about it. The dessert was not much better either. All I saw was a lot of pies and small donuts (cinnamon sugar, powder sugar, chocolate and maple). Their ice cream was half melted when given to me. Thats gross. Only best thing there was creme brulee which they used actual vanilla bean and torched sugar fresh so the top layer was nice and crispy.

It was probably my least favorite, but still good. We made a little sampler plate of the Greek food--yum! Sampled the lobster bisque. Mmmm! We skipped the seafood station & made to order salad station. NO ROOM, lol. Finally, after a couple games of keno, we rolled ourselves over to the dessert bar and put away a couple house made mini donuts & some cheesecake. Zero complaints! I'm not really a \"buffet person\" because the food is usually lacking in quality & not fresh, but I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. And there really is something for everyone! You really can't go wrong. Also, we really enjoyed the variety of drinks! We tried all kinds of different flavored sodas & juices! And the coffee was fresh & really quite delicious--and I tend to be a coffee snob. All in all, we had a fabulous meal! :)  Note: we didn't participate, but you can add on all you can drink, drinks for like $12!",

They were not friendly at all and were just rude.  Now to the food.  Not a lot of variety, food was bland, and most of it was cold.  The only good part of the buffet was the dessert section.  We definitely will not be coming back to this buffet again.",

I mean it was pretty cheap $30 isn't that much if you think about how overpriced everything is on the strip and my kids ate free so that was a plus. We had dinner here and brunch (they offer mimosas and champagne during brunch) and was satisfied both times. Nice selection of food and fresh pasta made for you. When I went it wasn't super crowded with people which I loved and the staff were very nice. I loved the chocolate strawberries mmm!",

Considering the options and the quality of food, it's not worth paying full price for this buffet.   The food was okay. Nothing amazing and nothing horrible. They had the standard: pancakes, crepes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, omelettes, bacon, etc. If you weren't feeling breakfast foods, then there was a salad bar, an Asian bar with sushi and salmon sashimi, and a dessert bar. I stuck to the typical breakfast foods. I did venture out to try some of their nigiri sushi but after one bite, I could tell it wasn't fresh. I stayed away from the sushi after that.  The dessert bar was by far my favorite. Mini donuts, chocolate croissants, ice cream, and even a cotton candy maker. I wanted some cotton candy but the chef behind the counter said he only turns that on when it's the lunch buffet.   There was nothing impressive about this buffet but it got the job done. I left breakfast stuffed and satisfied.",

Free doesn't make it tasty or worth it!  People were nice and all but the food was blah. Would not be going back regardless of free vouchers.

    "text": "The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any.   Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas.   The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas.   One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great.   Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",

The chicken apple sausage was delicious but I've come to the conclusion that no matter where I go, buffet waffles, French toast or pancakes are just not as good unless they are made to order. My boyfriend thought the sushi was pretty good for a breakfast start. The one downfall was there was no fancier cappuccinos but coffee only and I notice there isn't any creamers other than half and half.",

The pulled pork and chicken were all soggy and drenched in BBQ sauce. The beans were canned. And I hate when salad bars don't let you make the salad, they make it for you.   Overall, service was horrible too. I understand buffets get crazy, but we were pretty much neglected and had to call over the manager.

Sushi: Didn't taste fresh  American:   1) Mac n Cheese was dry 2) Prime Rib tasted like a bootleg flatiron steak, 3) I almost lost a tooth trying to rip off the meat from a pork rib.  Chinese: 1) Eggdrop soup was pretty good. 2) Chicken was overly saucy 3) Fried rice - cardboard like texture  Dessert: 1) Donuts were DELICIOUS - glazed, plain, and powdered. 2) Chocolate-covered strawberries YUMMMM  Service: The workers seem soo unenthusiastic. Took them FOREVER just to walk a few feet to pour some soup for me.  Overall: Food sucked. Dessert was awesome, but it wasn't enough to salvage my lunch.  Dessert was the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1.

Did I miss anything? Service was nice except being seated near two large parties, one was a wedding group of 30+ and a really large family of 14.

The pasta station was great...lots of options and everything was fresh.  They had multiple different styles of food from mexican to barbeque to asian.  The set-up was great...it didn't have a cafeteria vibe.  Seating is in the middle but large (mostly glass) dividers separate you from the stations making it feel more like a restaurant than a buffet.  As mentioned in other reviews, the dessert section was by far the highlight of the meal.  Mini-donuts that melt in your mouth, fresh cakes, chocolate covered strawberries and my wife absolutely loved the mini creme-brule.  Price was as expected for Vegas but I thought it matched the quality and selection well.  I'll definitely be back.",

Definitely don't make a trip to TI just for the Buffet, we ate there b/c we were staying there. The crab legs were tiny, everything else so-so. I agree with the rest of the reviewers, there are MUCH better places to eat. The dessert area is awesome though!!",

This place had some kinda gross eggs and also eggs benedict, but at least the omelettes were good and the coffee was strong. The desserts were displayed well but my cookie tasted stale. I would only go here out of convenience or drunken stupidity. The TI buffet is not that good of a buffet, at all, and you might as well spend the extra bucks to cab it to another hotel for buffet food.",

They have a sushi station, Chinese food station (including noodle soup made to order), BBQ station, salad station, pizza station, pasta station, and dessert bar.  There is a huge variety of desserts that would satisfy any sweet tooth - mini donuts, chocolate covered strawberries, fruit tarts, creme brulee, cupcakes, cookies, ice cream, eclairs, cakes, cotton candy, and more.  I don't typically eat a lot at once, so buffet are usually wasted on me, except for this one.  I get my money's worth from the dessets.  Lunch buffet is about $16 during the weekdays, and you can add unlimited champagne for $3 more.",

    "text": "The Buffet at Treasure Island was a surprising favorite of mine.  We ate at one buffet every day of our week long stay and this one of two at the top of my list!  It is one of the more inexpensive buffets at $21/person for dinner, but I was impressed at the quality of food and the value!  I really liked their food selections and the variety that was offered.  They had a made to order pasta bar that was my favorite of all the buffet pasta bars.  The flavors were fresh and the pasta wasn't oily.  I would recommend a mixed sauce of marinara and alfredo with the pasta of your choice and chicken and veggies tossed in!  They offered a good mix of recognizable American Chinese dishes (like orange chicken & spring rolls) as well as some more authentic Chinese fare, like beef tendon soup.  Even my husband's Chinese family was pleasantly surprised with the more traditional Chinese dishes.  The sushi was fresh and some of the best offered at a buffet. There is an extensive made to order salad bar for those who want to add a healthier course to their buffet experience, as well as delicious comfort foods like tender ribs, mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese.  The dessert buffet was wonderful and don't miss the fresh donuts!  I had to go back for seconds.  There is even some whimsy with freshly spun cotton candy.    It is a very modern clean restaurant that feels more like an bright but upscale restaurant than a hotel meeting space (which described several of the buffets we ate at.)  I think that it was recently renovated.  The restroom is located outside the restaurant in the casino, which was less than convenient, but otherwise, I really enjoyed both the food and atmosphere of the TI Buffet!  I would highly recommend this buffet and wished we had eaten there earlier in the week...I would have been tempted to return during our stay.",

    "text": "The buffet at Ti may not be as elaborate as those at other hotels, but from what I saw during my visit, the food did not in any way lack in flavor. I went during lunch on a weekday, the place was packed, this may have had something to do with the fact that the hotel was giving 2 for 1 coupons to their guests. I tried the salad station, and had the spinach salad, and a bit of veggies and a piece of turkey from the other stations. The salad was good, all fresh ingredients and not too salty. No other major complaints for anything else that I tried. There are about 4-5 other stations, including a pasta station, Mexican food, southern station, sushi/Asian food station and a soup station. I get that most people who go to a Vegas buffet expect to gorge themselves to the point of losing consciousness, and if you're one of those folks, then this may not be the place for you. If you're staying at TI and want a quick meal, then I would recommend this place. The TI buffet also has a dessert station, and after having cut down on the carbs for the last few months, I was overtaken by a spirit beyond my control, and decided to try the miniature cinammon/sugar donuts.  These donuts are the business, seriously, I had at least 4 and would have had another dozen had my dining companions not forcefully removed me from this place. Overall, I was a satisfied customer.",

No matter what my main course is I ALWAYS make sure to get the cobb salad, it's a party in my mouth every time.  Its by far the best cobb salad I've ever had and my favorite part of the meal.  And no matter what you do don't forget to check our the dessert section, even if you have no room left, take some home with you.

I didn't eat more than a couple of bites before I was completely disgusted. Everything else didn't taste good either. This was a terrible buffet.

So, we decided to check the lunch buffet out.   Total for the buffet using the buy 1 get 1 buffet coupon - $25.89  Pros: Service was good. (+1) Decent variety of food. Japanese, Southern (Regional BBQ) & Italian stations. Very inexpensive for a decent Vegas buffet. (+1)   Cons: Desserts were not good. Nothing stood out. (-1) Ribs were hard, chewy and lacked flavor (-1)",

At the omelette bar, the lady behind the grill was working the burners. Not only 1, but had 4 burners going on at the same time!!! BRAVO!!! Tip for you!!! She served with a smile and was working the line super quick.   Nothing special with the breakfast items - with your standard items. I ended up getting a steak with my omelette but it was overcooked and hard to cut into. So much for steak and eggs! I also got potatoes, corned beef, sausage, and biscuits and gravy.  Food was decent, clean atmosphere and prices were reasonable.",

I'm sure much of my review is due to an anti-buffet bias, but I really expected a lot more because Vegas buffets are so legendary. we got a free meal as part of the Mystere tickets (incredible show, btw) but I would have rather paid for a better meal. I think it's normally $32pp  there aren't as many stations as I expected. The best one was the BBQ area, the brisket was really good. the desserts were just okay. some of the fruit fillings on the tarts tasted canned.  while I'm sure there are those who appreciate quantity over quality, IMO even as a freebie for the Mystere show it's not worth it",

The desserts were great and breakfast had a descent amount of options. There were a ton of choices for drinks (juices, coffee, cold brew, frappuccino, mochas). The lunch buffet was less impressive. Many options including friend rice, Vietnamese noodles, sushi, pizza, pasta and various American food options. Unfortunately the items i tried for lunch were pretty sub par. Still though this buffet was a good value as far as Vegas restaurant prices go. I got my moneys worth just from breakfast coffee and dessert.",

I preferred the Carolina (mustard based) sauce and my wife preferred the sweet tomato based whiskey sauce.   The dessert section was, as others have said, the saving grace for this place. The creme brulee was phenomenal. I saw him torching it right there and asked for a fresh one and he got it for me. Chocolate covered strawberries made my wife really happy. And they have these cute little mini pies that are decent as well.   We got this because there was a dinner + show deal with mystere cirque du soleil. Probably wouldn't go back honestly because I'd rather have better food and not need a wheelchair to go on with my night.",

To my dismay, that was not the case.  -2 stars because I really wish that there were more choices available. There were mostly breakfast food, dessert, vegetables, sushi, and some variety of meat. The only fruit that was available was watermelon and maybe some oranges. But I guess that's what you get for $17.95.  +1 star for the omelet bar. That was the only food that was actually pretty decent. The quality of the eggs and other ingredients was just about as great as what you would get at a typical breakfast place. It didn't make that much of a difference just because you're in a casino buffet.  -2 stars because there wasn't else much that was really appetizing. There wasn't much taste to the bacon or the powdered eggs. I tried so hard to enjoy the eggs benedict, but the bread was too stale.  0 stars because service could have been a lot better with attention to our table. Bottomless mimosas were good though!  I will definitely try somewhere else for breakfast next time I'm in Vegas.",

Meat undercooked, \"freshly made ramen\" that tasted worse than Cup of Noodles. No meat options. They even ran out of Salmon sushi 3 hours before closing.   It's True,  you get what you pay for. We saved 25 a person but we missed out on a potentially great dinning experience. \"Be True to thyself. ..\"",

    "text": "I was there for dinner on a Thursday night. This was the blandest, most boring food I've had in Las Vegas. Seriously, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. And the line and the grill station was ridiculous. It should have been a sign to the management that they needed to add another line for the food, or increase the staffing. We're talking about food that is already cooked and portioned, so there should be very little time spent getting it. But it was the only part of the place with any line, other than the line to get in. I ended up giving into hunger and went to the pasta line instead and had pasta primavera. But it was terrible. it was oily and flavorless. It had literally four pieces of vegetables in it. And I saw him prepare it for me. Yet by the time I got back to the table it was already cold. How is this possible? Cold plate, very briefly cooked food.   There was no sour cream at the potato station. Ask for it and someone will carry a blob of it on a spoon from the kitchen. The salad bar requires you to ask someone to scoop the ingredients onto a small plate. The result is unappetizing. All the ingredient bins were picked over and the quantities given were miniscule. The resulting salad was terrible. And they were not very friendly. And no, I was not complaining or being difficult. They were just flat and unresponsive people.  On the upside, I did not get food poisoning, which is the only reason it gets two stars and not one. I recommend going the food courts over this dreck.  The one positive thing I have to say about the experience is that our server was friendly and pleasant. But everyone else was misery.  Whomever runs this place should be replaced immediately. They do not know how to run a pleasant place.",

The only bad thing about this visit is that the hostess decided to stick us at the smallest table in the restaurant where if you moved in the wrong direction just by an inch, you would be making contact with another customer at a different table. I wouldn't ordinarily complain about this, but there were at least 20+ tables around us that was more spacious. We took the liberty of moving ourselves.",

It has more of a dark wood restaurant feel to it and the spacing of the tables is adequate.  The food was just ok to me as they did have decent quantity, but the quality was kind of poor as everything looked as if it could have been pre-made and just sat out for awhile. Did not look very appetizing. Even the roast beef was very dry and sat out under the heating lamps for too long. Ughh. The only thing I really enjoyed eating were the crab legs as they tasted fresh and were very meaty!!  Also they do have a great dessert area where you can choose from fresh mini doughnuts to cotton candy and also house made ice cream.  The main reason we ate here was because we got a 2 for 1 buffet pass for staying  at TI otherwise I'm not sure if I would be eating here again.",

Very very average buffet we ate there only because we got late in picking up our show tickets and had booked the 9:30 Cirque show and didn't want to eat after the show. So thought oh Vegas is known for its buffets so let's do that. Worst decision ever. The fried rice was kept on the burners like forever they were too hard. Will not recommend at all. Servers were nice no complains there just food wasn't to par with the price wouldn't pay more than $10-15 for that meal.",

We went here simply because it's across the street from The Venetian and my hubby was \"too lazy to walk down to The Bellagio.\" A highlight was the dessert station. Best of all the offerings. If you're in an Uber, Lyft or a traditional taxi or your own wheels, drive the 215 to North Las Vegas and try the Medley Buffet at The Aliante. Cheaper and the food was much fresher and better tasting.",

The only reason I gave it two stars is because we had free vouchers to eat this garbage. I'm telling you, had I paid the full price of $24.95 each, I would have demanded my money back.   Back in the 80's, you didn't expect much, but you didn't pay hardly anything. And let me tell you, the food back then was really good. It was actually an attraction for the hotels. It seems as though, somewhere along the way, they realized that they could charge more since the food was good and as the prices went up, the quality went straight to hell.   Too bad these big wig owners don't seem to have a clue about these restaurants. I'd bet (pun intended) there isn't one big wig that has eaten at their own restaurants in years.... Because they know how bad they are. They're still making money no matter what, so what do they care.......  It's just to bad.",

No oatmeal in sight, very limited fresh fruit selection, and a couple stations full of Asian food including sushi, and salmon and lox.

A lot of families seem to enjoy this   We had 2 free meals from our reservation on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegas.com&s=815df335831efd1e460521ad580e06c20729c8d21a1b3ec4986fca500635ab53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegas.com</a> so we decided to use them on a Thursday night dinner. I didn't experience anything spectacular but I wasn't disappointed either!  Asian food: not great, don't even waste your stomach space on it... Maybe im a snobby asian, but their asian food was just below average. The eggdrop soup is okay if you want some warm comfort soup. The sushi was pretty terrible, lots of cold hard rice with a little bit of fish. American/BBQ food: Yum, stuff the majority of your stomach with this!!! The prim ribs is actually very decent, a little too cooked for my taste but still good! The chili is yummy. The chicken isn't so great. Mashed potatoes are pretty standard. Their salads are actually really good too if you want a healthier option. They have very food dressings!  Desserts: wait a cotton candy machine? Yeeppie. Chocolate covered strawberries and mini donuts!!!  Not too shabby for free dinners or those buy-one-get-one-free deals. If you live here and want some cheap food to fill up your stomach with some protein for cheap, go for it!",

    "text": "Service + Interior: 4 Price vs. Quantity: 5 Food Taste: 5  This is hands down my favorite buffet in Las Vegas. The quality of the food here is at the top while the price for the buffet is lower than the other popular resort buffets. There isn't as much selection, but I think the quality makes up for that. Even the dining area looks pretty upscale for a buffet.  I've eaten here for brunch and for Christmas Eve dinner. All of the breakfast items were great that I had. The scrambled eggs were cooked well (not dry or runny), the waffles were fluffy, the bacon was PERFECT, and even the breakfast sausage was good. I'm noticing that a lot of the buffets give really fatty and greasy breakfast sausages which is a huge put off. They had biscuits and gravy as well which was pretty darn tasty.  The Chinese food selection is probably the best quality of all the buffet places I've been to. It actually tastes like you went to *insert your favorite Chinese restaurant here* instead of cheap and fatty quality that you get at other buffets. Their pizza is single handedly the best pizza from any of the buffets I've eaten at. The quality was so good that if it was a pizza place I might have considered ordering delivery from it. The cheese was melty, crust was flavorful, and it wasn't dried out.  Now on to my favorite part. The freaking turkey dinner. Oh. My. God. That turkey was the juiciest turkey I had ever eaten. I mean seriously it just fell apart in your mouth because it was so tender and it dripped with the amazing turkey juice. Pair that with their perfectly moist and tasty stuffing, some cranberry sauce, and mashed potatoes. It tasted like I was eating a home cooked turkey dinner. This was on Christmas Eve, mind you, so I hope the quality isn't drastically different on a normal day, but I had 2.5 plates of this because it was so good.  A huge draw for me is that they have an entire self serve drink area. Their pepsi machines let you choose a basic drink (say regular pepsi) and then you can pour the flavor in MANUALLY. Meaning if you want vanilla pepsi, you pour the pepsi in the cup and then you actually pour the vanilla syrup (as much as you want) into the regular pepsi. First time I've ever seen this. They have several frozen drinks, some fruit flavored and others coffee flavored. They also have a whole machine devoted to uniquely flavored ice teas and other sodas.  The dessert section is very appealing to look at but it's probably the weakest thing here. Everything LOOKS tasty, and don't get me wrong it's not bad, but it all tastes the same. They are very heavy handed with the sugar so everything is hyper sweet causing it all to blend together if you try multiple things. They have basic dessert items, nothing unusual/unique like Bacchanal or Wynn.",

It was for lunch and there was just about anything you can imagine, from barbecue, to sushi (not gonna eat it, sorry) to made to order Chinese and salad, fresh baked pizza and grilled burgers. It's all there on the bar, some areas seemed thin and/or not in use and that's Ok.

That's where I expect a buffet to excel, but nope, the chocolate cream pie tasted store bought as did the eclairs (Which if you wanted to you could buy them for $2.50 each.. uh.. no)  and the cream caramel cupcake was bland.   it was Ok.",

You can get a wide variety of salads made for you. The Caesar salad is very good.   And they have smoked salmon and capers which I loved. The pizza was O.K, but nothing really stood out to me. The brunch buffet comes with mimosas which weren't very good IMHO. Also, the seats are very low. If you're short, then you won't be comfortable in a booth. I'm not that short, I'm 5'4, but I felt weird in the booth. Also, if the person behind you moves, you will feel it. I sure did. It was annoying as hell.   I should've asked if we could move since hardly anyone was there at the time. To be on the safe side, ask for a table, not a booth. The desserts there aren't that good either. They're just O.K. Also, if you're in line for food, KNOW what the hell you want and not just sit there staring at the food forever. That's just so rude! My husband hates people like that so much, that he'll actually push small kids out of the way at buffets, or he'll just move in in front of them. One time he even let out a SBD fart w/o any shame since he couldn't deal with the idiots who just sit there and take forever to make up their minds. lol! He has no shame, lol! That sure cleared up the area fast, lol!  If you can't make up your damn mind, then just come back once you think you can decide what you want in less than a minute tops! One lady had to ask me to move so that she could get to the gravy at the meat station since some stupid chic was just yakking away to the person behind the counter. She either didn't care about the annoyed stares she was getting, or she didn't notice.   I made sure she noticed how annoying she was by loudly saying to the lady next to me, sorry, but I can't move right now since that woman in front of me won't move. She didn't say anything back. I just moved as close as I could to that woman w/o touching her just so that woman could lean over and get the gravy she wanted. I hate morons like that, ugh!",

One thing I always look for is that the service is great and that the workers are there to make the customers experience great and it met all those. If you are looking for a not so expensive but great buffet you should really stop by here you won't regret it.",

The food selection was less than mediocre, the waiters were chit chatting with the cashier near entrance of the dining room, and you can tell by the taste of the food, it had been sitting. Shame on us for not consulting with yelp before we swiped our credit card. Truly disappointing.",

    "text": "Thank goodness we were staying at TI so we had a BOGO coupon.  The strip hotel restaurants have become so expensive so maybe paying $30/person is better than the deli charging $16 for an Italian beef sandwich. This is one of my only knocks on staying at TI...the expensive not so tasty food choices.  The buffet has your normal options like prime rib, salads, etc.  They also have sushi which is a bonus.  All of the food was good but nothing that really stood out to me.  It was your typical Vegas buffet.  I did think that the dessert station was above average. That boosted my star rating to three vs. the two that I was going to give.  The service was decent.  Nothing beyond the dessert bar really made this special.  In a pinch and if you have a coupon I recommend the buffet. Seriously don't pay full price for it!",

I could rip this place a new one and type a mini novel, but I think it's easy enough to say that most everything in the buffet was dry... looked like most things had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The only redemption was the Asian section, in that section food was going out and new dishes were coming out regularly.  But that food wasn't the most wonderful, but it was at least fresh.",

With quite a few sections that span over A good american breakfast, a made to order pasta and omelet station, bbq section, Fresh Fruits, sushi for the sushi for the sushi lovers, selection of juices, coffee, tea, and even gas station coffee (French Vanilla...yumm). All in all it has everything but the dreaminess.  The dessert bar however was great. Oh and lets not forget a free round of KENO $1 per breakfast ticket you purchase. If you are in vegas I would suggest eating a buffet somewhere else if you are not starving in the morning like me.",

The food was cold and quality was low. They had breakfast items such as crepes, waffles, pancakes... But what I tried was lukewarm at best.  The egg benedict was definitely the best from that section.  Even the mimosas were a bit off. Served in regular big glasses, I barely finished one.  Can't go wrong with an omelette station, which my husband took advantage of.  They also had a healthy grains/salad station but I wasn't feeling it.  The BBQ station had ok ribs and cold mac n cheese.  I figured I'd make my money worth with peel and eat shrimp but they were obviously frozen and bland, but more edible dipped in cocktail sauce. I was hoping for crab legs but I guess they only have for dinner.  Sushi was terrible, the rice was super cold and hard.   I had a bowl of pho to get myself full and it wasn't horrible but it was bland.  From the Dessert area, not a lot caught my attention. There were big cupcakes and other pastries. I did try a fruit tart and creme brulee and they were not bad.  Service was good. However, with so many other options in Vegas, I would not go back especially if I had to pay full price.",

    "text": "I'm shocked at how low the reviews are for this place. I went here with my boyfriend this past Monday as we were checking out of our room and I completely enjoyed it!   The Buffet at TI is on the smaller side, but it does not disappoint. I believe the quality is MUCH higher than at most buffets that have such a large selection. There really wasn't anything I didn't like, and that's huge considering we came at the end of breakfast while they replaced some items for lunch (so we had really old breakfast food, and some fresh lunch food).   The chinese dishes are a little better quality here than at most places, and so is the pizza. I enjoyed all of the breakfast items, except they have flimsy bacon - otherwise, everything is good.  I also believe its a cheaper buffet, considering. You can find a coupon online that gives you $5 off I believe. The biggest perk about this place is that it's very quiet and not too many people come here. So the atmosphere is excellent and not many lines for food.  Another perk: self serve drinks. Yep. Oh and btw, they have freezers (like icees or slushies - strawberry banana, other fruit flavors, coffe and chocolate flavors too!). Dessert is EXCELLENT here, though I was full before we got to breakfast so I didn't have much of it.  Again, smaller selection but at a higher quality. You'll ENJOY! :)",

I had sushi with just about every meal, fresh fruit, \"OMG\" want to really set me on fire tell me there is dessert and this girl is in heaven... yes I have a sugar tooth.... I especially loved while walking around the casino you could stop and watch the pastry chef  serving, and mixing up what they we're serving.

I've been here twice and had plate after plate of it. The pastas are good too, mix then with the brisket and ribs with tangy bbq sauce and it's great. Service is very friendly and deserves a tip as well. When you're done the dessert section is to die for. A million flavors of ice cream and yogurt, chocolate covered strawberries, it's fantastic.

Dessert selection was decent as well.  I think I had two creme brulees.  If you foresee yourself going into a drunken rage later in the evening, you can fuel that by eating here first.",

While the staff is helpful enough, the place just seems kind of on the cheapish side and it has very little selections despite it offering \"Asian/American/Italian/Mexican\" fare. Most of the food was cooled down to room temp already or just tasted off. I can find a bigger selection at my local buffet back home for less. The dessert was good, probably the best they had to offer out of the whole place. I would either save my money and walk on over to one of the malls for a quick cheap bite to eat or spend just a bit more money and time to get on the line for the buffets at the better resorts.",

The line can get long, but probably a 15-20 minute wait maximum.   The interior is decorated nice enough. The first time we ate here it was just alright. This time around however, the quality seemed to have dropped a bit. The food just didn't taste as fresh and the majority of it tasted like cafeteria food; nothing special or fancy. Not my cup of tea.   What salvaged the meal for me was the dessert section. I think the cotton candy is a nice touch. I also liked the creme brulee here better than the one at Bacchanal.   I would definitely NOT pay full price for this buffet. I'm not sure I would eat here again unless we receive the two free buffet vouchers that we got the first time we stayed at T.I.",

We paid proceeded in and grabbed a plate as we were walking towards the only like 3 remaining breakfast items the guy pulls them. My friends and I ask the guy like can we have some of that bacon he ignored us and throws it away. At this point I'm sad I was really in the mood for breakfast food still. So we go to the next breakfast item there are no tongs to grab the food so we ask the guy can we get some tongs to have some of this item he looks at us crazy gives us the tongs and says it's dinner time now. I told him well the lady in the front said we could eat breakfast for the next 30 mins. He was like well she is wrong. I was pissed at this time now. Then from one bad thing to the next moral of the story I will not be eating there again because their food was not very good and I feel as if I was lied to and that's not a good feeling.",

Some of the proteins offered are crab legs, sushi (eel), ribs, bacon, sausage, clams depending on the time of day.   Overall they have a decent selection that can fit almost any diet.

We started out and saw there was \"prime rib\" at a carving station already cut into slices and sitting under a heat lamp. Calling this \"prime rib' was a stretch of the imagination. It was well done and tough like dried out roast beef. I tried a slice and I was sorry I did. They had snow crab legs that were on ice. Every crab leg I've ever eaten was steamed or served hot. For that reason I didn't even try them. My stepdaughter said the shrimp was good. The only bright spot I found in the whole place was the Asian stir fry had good flavor. The ladies also liked the dessert bar. We all felt the food in general was very mediocre and seriously lacked care or love. This was definitely a disappointing meal and most definitely not worth $32.95 per person plus tax. If you are looking for a good buffet, this is not it. Sorry but I won't waste my time or money on this place again.",

Most of the items on the menu were down to earth comfort foods, but what's nice about it is that they have comfort foods from other countries as well. One of my favorite things at the buffet was the pho station. I must have eaten 5 bowls of pho over my trip there. The BBQ station was excellent, with super tender ribs and and great potatoes. Their dessert station had all the regular standards like mousse and flan, but I particularly enjoyed the cotton candy and the chocolate covered strawberries. We were there during the Holiday season so every day was a mimosa lunch. The servers were very prompt and good with the drinks and the seating area was clean and well maintained. It may not have had the fanciest buffet with exotic items but, I thoroughly enjoyed myself every time we ate there.",

The buffet is divided into different classes of cuisines around the world: seafood, Asian, Italian, American, dessert,   The good: pasta station-my friend's lobster ravioli was righteous salad station-customizable salads with fancy topping options Prime rib was very juicy and one of the tastier ones that I've had from a buffet many tasty desserts, including bread pudding, mini donuts, cakes, ice cream, delish cream puffs and eclairs  The bad: limited options overall, but especially at the dessert station seafood bar was limited; crab legs/shrimp were over salted from the looks of the menu, the Asian noodle bar is a disgrace to Asian food  Quick tip: do NOT stuff your face if you're planning on going out at night and wearing a skin-tight dress with high heels. That extra food baby really does a number on you, especially when inebriated.",

    "text": "I'd be a horrible friend...  ... if it was your first time in Vegas and I took you to the TI Buffet to break your Sin City buffet cherry. Unfortunately, that exactly is what happened this Vegas visit so I am a horrible friend! :D  Even if this buffet is free, I still would advise you to stay away unless you're looking for a quick snack or itchin' for a sweet tooth fixin'. The food ranges from passable to gag-worthy. There were no crab legs in the seafood section, and my smoked-salmon fanatic friend shunned theirs (how do you mess that up?). The Noodle Bar was actually passable, but the pho had this super dark brown soup that tasted like watered-down soy sauce.  The Eggs Benedict had a overly sour hollandaise sauce. *shuddergag*  You're mostly safe in the dessert arena (I wolfed down two creme creme brulees after being let down by most of the savory foods), but stay away from the bitter-berries. Other safe options include: bacon, country fried potatoes, and breakfast steak... if you're lucky!   The breakfast steak is a great way to test if Lady Luck is smiling upon you. Whereas my friend's steak had a pink and cold center (comes from not letting the meat defrost fully before throwing it on the grill). Mine was over cooked and had the texture of a jerky. Yes. I considered myself lucky.      Two stars because the service was actually decent for a large party and also if someone handed me a free voucher, I'd still go in for the creme brulee ;)  TLDR: I wouldn't bring my second-worst enemy to this buffet. Worst, maybe. Not second worst.",

The shrimp with egg noodle was salty as well but the broth looked better.  Their crab legs were ok, although I found that to be super salty as well. The other stations they have were BBQ, salad, pasta and fried seafood. None in which were exciting. I did enjoy their mini donuts that they have at the dessert bar.",

The food itself doesn't really stand out and with Vegas being synonyms with buffets this one gets rated a little on the lower end. I mean the food isn't bad, but it also isn't good. The service that was provided was excellent though. The waiter and the hostess were very friendly. I would probably say that the two best things about the buffet was that it was free....I mean who doesn't love a free meal and two the dessert was pretty good. They have cotton candy!  So would I pay the price of over $20 per person for this buffet? Ummm probably not, but if you do have a coupon for it then I say give it a try. If you are looking for a more high quality buffet then I would recommend checking out the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo hotel.",

The pasta sauce was more typical than Ragu in a can, and the sushi rice drier than the Sahara Desert. Chinese food? Talk about a downgrade from Panda Express. Desserts? Ever see those neglected Barbie dolls pushed to the back of thrift shop toy section shelves?

Walked over to the BBQ station, they had some fried chicken, mashed potato's, rotisserie chicken, and beef ribs, which my son and I grabbed a couple each....Ehhhhhh, a little too tuff for me. We then went to the Asian food department, nothing really looked appetizing. Was I not as hungry as I thought or was the food not appealing to us?       I finally gave up, but my son proceeded to the dessert bar. I walked over with him to accompany him and see what else the buffet had to offer... Hmmmmm a few decent looking desserts along with some ice cream but that's pretty much it. My son ended up getting the mini donuts. I did see someone walking around with chocolate covered strawberries but I must of passed them up or they were in the middle of refilling them.  Aside from the food not appeasing us, the waitress sucked ass!! Just before getting up to leave for good, the manager came over and picked up all our dirty dishes that accumulated while we ate and then asked if there was something else we wanted.

You can get as much avocado as you request and they will toss it.  Also, the italian sub is really good.  Best sandwich In vegas in my opinion.  Pizza is pretty good as well.  Its not as big as other buffets, but if you want pizza, subs or salad, you should be satisfied",

I understand a larger party may take longer to get seated however the place was empty. Empty tables left and right, their excuse was that we could not be seated due to their low staff on this day, at the same time smaller parties are being seated. They told me this after I had already paid and been waiting for 20 minutes. I would of been happier if they told me this before paying, I would have gone somewhere else. We finally get seated and go to their buffet where food selection was limited and the taste was fair. I would of been happier with a McDonalds breakfast for a far less price. I will say their desserts were delicious and I guess that's their one star they have earned other than that go somewhere else. There are better buffets that are way better than this and don't get their mimosas it's got like some generic orange juice taste you don't want to have. I had a great experience at the Bacchanal buffet located at Caesars Palace.",

The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty.  Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams.   Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you.   And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy.  Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started.   Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :(",

    "text": "This is a WONDERFUL buffet!  I came here on a Saturday Night after an exhausting day at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The BFF and I didn't want to spend too much money on a buffet (Wynn) since she was tight on money so we went here instead. $26.95 for Saturday Night Buffet Dinner, which wasn't too bad.. I still thought it was a little pricey for the cost but I didn't mind too much. ($30 including tax)  We were just looking for a place that offered Prime Rib and Crab Legs and here the Treasure Island Buffet had it!  Prime Rib here was not bad at all, very delicious with a heaping spoonful of mashed potatoes and meat juice. I was looking for vegetables (Steamed or grilled) but they didn't have any at all :(. And this is where Wynn wins. But I was able to grab some broccoli from the Chinese Beef and Broccoli to save my meal. MMMMMM :)  I really hate salty crab legs, but the crab legs here weren't too salty. And simply awesome with MELTED BUTTER AND LEMON!! OH, my butter!!! These crab legs weren't the best, but who cares, all you can eat crab legs, why not.  They have a pasta bar, so I was able to fulfill my teeny pasta craving with Fettucine Alfredo with Shrimp and Mushrooms. You can taste the garlic!! I LOVE GARLIC! MMMM!!  Dessert selections totally beat Wynn's Buffet though. They have chocolate strawberries, cotton candy, MINI DONUTS!!!, baby pies, creme brulee that was sooooo creamy and not runny. UGH!!! So good.  If I was nearby TI, was starving and had a sweet-tooth, I'd definitely come here again :)",

Our terrible service started with our server taking our drink orders as he was tending to an empty table while we were walking by to get food. He was then never seen again up until dinner was almost over. Drink refills were almost impossible to get, so were napkins. I had to stand up to help my self with napkins and utensils that were taken away (after my table had been half way filled with empty dishes). If you are looking for good service or any service at all, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a good meal, this again is not the place for you. The food selection was sparse and every item that was offered was either over cooked, or made from powder. The only saving grace for our meal was the pineapple .. which only had to be cut.  Overall this was a very disappointing experience. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

T.I. is clearly trying to present a \"high end\" buffet with the smaller plates but ultimately detracts from the whole purpose of buffet: getting lots of different food all at once. At least that's how I like my buffet.   Aside from the presentation of the buffet here, the food itself was not very good. The prime rib was flavorless, the salad that I requested, a spinach salad, was blah. The mac and cheese was a half step up from Kraft. The sushi really killed me: the station had a selection of maybe two or three pieces of different sushi on each plate so you are stuck taking the combinations they have created for you.  And the sushi wasn't even very good! Mushy rice, bland fish. The crab legs and shrimp were ok and tasted pretty fresh.   I enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries and macaroon for dessert. But all in all, this is one weak buffet that I will not be visiting again.",

For the amount you pay for this meal, it's not worth it. I've been to the buffet in Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, Rio, Mirage, and residential buffets. All of them have better variety, better quality.

The quality of food is generally worse than if you'd order an entree at a normal restaurant, most restaurants serve portions that are big enough to satisfy already, the novelty of eating fried rice, prime rib, and pasta at the same time does not appeal to me, and you end up paying more than usual for this sub-par dinner.    Given my disinterest in buffets, this one still ranks towards the bottom of buffets I've tried.  Nothing I tried was horrible per se, but it wasn't very good either.

They had a huge drink selection, which I thought was pretty cool. Hot coffee, iced latte machines, slushy coffee frappes, soda (Pepsi products), flavored water, and slushy icee drinks. The food selection, on the other hand, was pretty small. My favorite part was the seafood area, where they had really good crab cakes and lobster bisque. They had a chef making pasta, which I was pretty excited for at first, but was pretty disappointed in the alfredo sauce. It tasted kind of gluey? They also had a pretty cool salad bar where a chef would toss your salad. The fruit selection was pretty small, to my disappointment. All the food I had was decent, but I was just really disappointed in their lack of selection. The dessert area was pretty cool though! They had of cakes, fruits dipped in chocolate, tarts and cookies. You could also order ice cream and cotton candy! I got a freshly made cotton candy that was amazing and made me feel like a kid again. The chocolate dipped strawberries were kinda tart though. For the price, the buffet wasn't bad, overall, but it'd be nicer to go to a buffet with a bigger selection.",

The Sushi wasn't fresh and was coming out of large pans from a premade stash. I should kick myself for even trying to BBQ- the ribs were dry as a bone (think beef jerky) and the prime rib was fatty.   The line to get in was VERY long- until they let about 30 tables in all at once- so the lines at the buffet sections were long.   All round, it was a lousy experience.",

There was a full 'German Section' which was interesting, pretzel rolls and jagerschnitzel(?) which were pretty bad. Desert was decent, ice cream, tarts (sub-par) and cotton candy.",

Everything else was very ehhh - pho soup tasted like disinfectant, the \"mexican food\" was not tasty, the salads were old and the desserts were bland.  You would think in a nice hotel the buffet would be good but apparently not. I actually think that Hometown buffet or Sizzler is better!

Loved the creme brulee, NY cheesecake, chocolate-covered strawberries, red valet cupcake. Everything was delicious. Wish I had more room for desserts!

    "text": "Pretty decent food - more towards the american menu.   They do have a simple japanese sushi spread, not that fantastic. Oriental spread - pretty ok. American spread and italian spread(with pizzas and pastas) make up the bulk of their menu.   Salad spread is good though, with different types of salads to choose and the buffet lady would start mixing the different greens together.  Drinks are free (any type), except the alcoholic ones.  Overall, I would give this a 6/10, definitely tasted way way better buffets than these, but it deserves the thumbs up for the price I paid for it and for the spread it serves.  Tip: One way to get really good and economical value buffets is to head to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftix4dinner.com&s=e345deadd083779a522aec9852b155609aa77786915945929926a3af3b0628c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tix4dinner.com</a> and get a buffet discount coupon. You pay 2 dollars and you get 25% or something like off your dinner buffet. Might be even more.  Once again, it isnt that fantastic but if you're on a budget, this should be more than sufficient!  Cheers!",

I came here with my wife during lunch hours and we both were equally impressed with the quality of the food and cleanliness of the buffet. the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were my 2 favorites and i couldn't help but go back up and dig in for more. The american comfort food section gets 4 stars in my opinion , would give it 5 but its missing all of the veggies... No green beans,corn,broccoli etc... Pretty odd to skip out on that but my wife was more bummed out than myself.... I was cool with eating meats and potatoes. I didn't attempt the asian stuff and the pizza bar was sub-par it all look dried out and whats up with fruit on top of pizza ? Maybe its just not my style. the dessert section was above average. The fresh baked donuts,caramel apple cupcake and parfait(wife's fav) were all very tasty and worth mentioning. lastly the cotton candy was a pretty cool a tasty gimmick ;)",

I planned on eating at the Wynn for our Lunch/Dinner buffet experience and that's where I wanted to spend a lot of money at. I could see Treasure Island directly out of our hotel window so I decided to look up their buffet on Yelp and decided that would be perfect. We went at 0900 and we only had to wait in line about 15 minutes. It was Sunday so we had the Sunday Champagne Brunch which was a little more expensive than the normal weekday breakfast, but was very good. The quality of food wasn't out of this world like the Wynn's lunch, but I have a Ron Swanson love of breakfast food and you simply can't go wrong with a breakfast buffet. Pile mounds of bacon, ham, sausage, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, crepes on and repeat. The omelet station was really awesome and the lone woman working it was making 6 at a time and still made each perfectly to the guests specifications. She received a $2 tip from me and judging by the pile of money in her tip jar, others felt she was doing a good job too. When I come back to Vegas, this will definitely be the main breakfast buffet I eat at.",

After seeing the dinner food selection then tasted the food I wished they never gave me the free buffets and just credit me the equivalent of $30+ for dinner per person value instead.  Food selection was horrible with 5 small food stations with terrible selection.  The only seafood was what Treasure Island calls \"Sushi Bar\".  The fish was so thinly sliced and felt like rubber - tasteless.  They had a German theme that night and all it was hot dog wieners, sauerkraut and something that said schnitzel that tasted more like cardboard - one bite I spat it out.  The only place lined up was the BBQ bar and that too was quite awful this side of Texas & Memphis.  Tasteless ribs that the meat had to be pried from the bone (caveman style) rather than fall off the bone.  Only their prime rib was so-so that actually was cooked to medium rare, however the flavor needs further improvements.  So they have a pasta station with some cooks making simple dishes like ravioli, linguine dishes and so on that they expect tips when they make it.  Seriously?  I already paid over $30 for this retched food and they want more of my money??  They have an Asian section (see above about Sushi).  By far their attempt on Asian food was a disgrace even compared to frozen box supermarket pre-made spring rolls and terrible noodles and rice.  Then there is their attempt on Vietnamese food - they made the absolute most horrid PHO Noodles on the planet.  It was so bad, I would not even call it generic beef noodle soup!  Please whatever you do, don't try this buffet unless you want to experience diarrhea... which was what I experienced 15 min after leaving the buffet.   I have to say that the only saving face with this buffet was the desert bar.  But even that is just average.",

    "text": "I was there in October 2012 and it was fantastic. I was just there again in April and bragged to my friends about how great it was and we were all horribly disappointed. We got there later in the evening and stood in this very slow moving line. I could see a ton of empty tables but for some reason they were staggering in the people about every 5 minutes or so. By the time we got close to the cashier, he anounced it would be closing in 30 minutes. We debated but thought we could eat and be out in 30 minutes. We got in. Service was bad. The server (not sure her name but long ponytail and hefty girl) was very unfriendly. Food was dry and as it got closer to closing time they took our silverware when we went back for \"last call\". They were still sitting people up to 10 minutes before it was to close and we saw them and were like WTF, those poor people really got ripped off. Anyway I was sad it was not what it was in October. I have been to Luxur, Excalibur and Paris Buffet too and Paris is the best I have had in LV. I have been there several times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and would highly recommend it. I will probably try others at other hotels before going back for din at TI. I was really embarrassed that I had bragged so much about it to the friends I had brought.",

The service wasn't great and about 20 minutes after leaving the buffet it was clear that something didn't agree with my stomach because I immediately ran to the bathroom and got sick. I will definitely not be returning to this buffet.",

    "text": "One of the worst buffets we have visited in Las Vegas.  We tried breakfast dinner and Friday dinner.  Each time the food was pretty bland and or dried out.  The omelet bar at breakfast is a pasta bar at dinner and  both were mediocre which sadly was the best rating for the food.  The desert selection which is normally a strong point at most buffets was equally weak in selection and taste.  The best thing about the TI Buffet is the great selection of drinks.  There is serve yourself coffees, ice coffees, slushies, fruit juices, flavored water, soda, high end soda, teas and more.  TI literally has the best drink selection of any buffet in Vegas, if only the food could come close to this.    On top of the poor selection and food quality prices are pretty high, breakfast is $20.95, lunch is $24.95, dinner is $30.95 and Friday/Saturday dinner is $32.95.  We only ate here because we received two free buffets each day as part of our room package.  The hotel and casino are nice but we will opt for free show tickets next time we stay here.",

The old buffet that this one replaced didn't always have the best food but they offered a lot more and out of those items, there were always a few very good options. Now not even worth going to. Plus the do this stupid buy 1/get one buffet offer which is worthless if you happen to be dining alone.   Hope you're paying attention, TI - this buffet ain't cutting it. Please re-tool and let us know when you've got it right. I would have expected better for a revamp that kept buffet closed for months.",

Pasta selection was good, according to the others in the wedding party.    I had stuffed halibut which was very good.  Also had some type of a steamed or baked white fish.  Maybe tilapia or pollock?  Not sure, but very flaky, mild and I had seconds.  The Asian selection was acceptable.  I had eggrolls and fried rice, both of which were good.  The deserts were delicious.  The Creme Brulee was very good.  They even had cotton candy.  Seriously!  I didn't have any but others did.  With free parking and across from the Fashion Show Mall, we will be back for sure.",

A lot of the food was very bland. We even ended up trying the pizza to in hopes of finding something that would be palatable. Still disappointed. The only thing we agreed to be tolerable, was the coffee. For $35/person spent, it was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. We should have just put it into a slot machine.

Different kinds of waters strawberry and raspberry lemon and Keewee ,green tea and honey black coffee ,iced coffee just plain water ,soda  and the usual fruit drinks .

Being that this casino was where we stayed, often times we were too tired to trek elsewhere and found it to be most convenient.  I was quite happy with both the breakfast and the lunch options.  There were plenty to choose from without being overwhelmed, and they kept the counters nice and clean.  Not to mention that with each buffet purchase, we were given $1 to play keno with.  The dessert counter is always the best, from fresh chocolate dipped strawberrys to freshly made mini donuts.  Everything was quite good.  For breakfast, they had dry cereal, an omelet station, sushi, salad, eggs benedict, waffles, pancakes, seriously...a lot of options.  For lunch, they had a 3 choices of soup with grilled cheese, a baked chicken, chinese noodles, among other things as well.  They also had quite an extensive drink option as well.  From hot coffee/tea to sodas, juice, iced coffee and if you went on the weekends, it would be a champagne brunch where you can get unlimited mojitos or champagne.  Great for those that start the drinking early!",

    "text": "I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, \"The Buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.  First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.  I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck",

I would have preferred a more diverse amount of coffee with all the options that are now available but the coffee they have is also good.

However, if you're looking for endless hearty, comfort food to fill up on at a decent price, this place fits the bill. I've eaten here twice (both breakfast and dinner) and the food tastes good and it's definitely a buffet you can leave feeling satisfied. The service is friendly and the drinks are self-serve now, with fun options like slushies and milkshakes, which was pretty cool to me. I really liked their Korean BBQ and make your own pasta area. If you run into a TI employee in the casino, be kind and chat with them even if you can't buy whatever package deal they want you to buy - they gave us a 25% off voucher for the buffet even though we weren't staying there, which was really nice of them! Plus, Treasure Island is one of the last hotels on the Strip that continues to offer free parking. It's a good buffet.",

When I think of Buffet food, I think of food that has been sitting there for awhile that is luke warm. The food here is fresh and some made to order (pasta, sushi, asian soup). I have to say my favorites were the pasta bar and the asian food. They had great items for kids too, like burgers, pizza, mac/cheese, spaghetti, etc.   But, save room for the dessert section of this buffet!!! It is FANTASTIC! Some items that were there were: specialty cupcakes, creme brule, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, cream puffs, eau claires, ice cream, cotton candy (kids favorite), and pies.....just to name a few!!!   The service was only OK. We had to actually search for our waitress the first night to get a refill on our pops. The plates piled up on our table for most the meal. For what you pay, the service of the wait staff could definitely be much better!  The prices for adults weren't terrible at $23.95 for supper, but kids who are 10 or older are considered an adult. I personally believe that a 10 year old should not eat as much as an adult or be encouraged to eat that much. Anyways the other kids were $15.95 for supper(still a bit pricey for kids, in my opinion). If you are staying at TI, make sure to use the 2 for 1 coupon that comes with your room coupons. The prices for breakfast and lunch were a little cheaper. We only ate here at supper time.",

This buffet is comparable to your typical China buffet. Selections are very small. Will not be back for dinner. If we do get another free coupon will use it on breakfast and enjoy me some cereal :) the server was good at getting us what we needed very fast, but no bacchanal buffet ambiance and smile :(. Thank goodness my wonderful bf was here to help me through this tough time.",

The Brunch during the weekend has many different breakfast options. The omelet tasted better than IHOP or Original Pancake House.  The chefs create made to order salads which a smile and are attentive to what I want in the salad.  The BBQ was a favorite for my husband and the sushi didn't taste as fresh as other restaurants but it tasted good.  I loved the Orange Chicken as it was crispy and wasn't full of fatty pieces.  The Dessert! Oh the Dessert!!! Amazing!!! They were not buffet style...they were boutique bakery style desserts! Wow! I would come just for dessert. And they have sugar free options too!! We went twice and would go again if we came back to Treasure Island!",

She was extremely helpful, polite and just plain awesome. She's the reason I'm giving two stars because the buffet food is not worth the 25 bucks per person for lunch!

I had sushi, (dry rice), bbq, (dry too), and scampi, (undercooked noodles and mealy, undersized shrimp). I should have stopped at one plate, but spotted some fried calamari. Ate a couple but left the rest for the staff to play ring toss with. The servers were uninspired to refill drinks. Everyone around me was waving their arms like overly enthusiastic school kids to flag them down. I had a half-priced coupon from the hotel which should have been a fair warning. Desserts were decent with a good selection of ice cream. Spend your buffet bucks elsewhere.",

I've been to over a dozen casino buffets and this is the worst so far for dinner.  The sushi is like the typical sushi found in chinese restaurant buffet.  There is no sashimi, no meat carving, no seafood and so-so salads.  We went back for breakfast buffet, which was not bad considering the 2-for-1 price.    If I ever stay in Treasure Island again, I will not get Lunch or Dinner buffet unless it's free (not even 2-for-1 coupon is worth it because the food is not good in the first place).  I will still go to the breakfast buffet with the coupon (but only if I'm staying in the hotel already).  So it's 1 star for Dinner and 2 or 3 stars for Breakfast.",

I was excited to compare this buffet with the one at Main Street in Old Vegas (Downtown).  So I roll in and notice that it was a lot cleaner that is for sure.  But the taste of disappointment filled my mouth when I took my first bite.  There were two things that help salvage this place from getting a one star review.  The first was how good the service was.  Finally the dessert station was crazy good.  They had mini donuts, cookies, cakes, pies (excuse me I had to wipe the drool from my mouth), ice cream, and flippin cotton candy!    If you have bland taste buds then this place is for you.  Otherwise, I'd recommend you go elsewhere to satisfy your hunger!!",

Apparently it's because they don't have anyone to clear tables because when I finally got to pay my $22 (comped, fortunately) I was lead past more than a few dirty tables that I could have been seated at if they had been cleaned.  I liked the barbecue varieties, but the Cajun food I tried was kinda gross.  So were the \"Chef's Specialty\" barbecue chicken wings (very dry and obviously sitting under heat lamps for a long time).  Dessert kinda saved the day, but it wasn't enough for me to cheer about.  Go if you must, but if you're looking for a \"destination buffet\" this isn't it.",

    "text": "MY THANKSGIVINGS OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS:  2004: Rainforest Cafe, San Francisco, CA (food so overpriced and terrible that I can't even remember what I ate) 2005: my roommate's family's house, Salinas, CA (spent eating Filipino food on a Saturday, since for some reason they don't celebrate the holiday on the actual day) 2006: Todai, Las Vegas, NV (Japanese buffet at the now extinct Aladdin Hotel, overthrown by Planet Hollywood) 2007: Buffet at Treasure Island, Las Vegas, NV  At first glance, my list makes it seem as if it's been years since I've had a REAL Thanksgiving. Au contraire, this year was as genuine a holiday as ever--surrounded by family, endless rows of food, endless outlet stores on Black Friday, endless betting tables and slots, endless nightlife possibilities...   Seriously, how much more thankful could you be!!  Not to mention, the Buffet at T.I. had an impressive authentic Thanksgiving dinner spread that Thursday evening. I had the teensiest slices of turkey and ham, and the ittiest bit of mashed potatoes. The rest of my plate went to sushi, crab legs and dessert (including a pumpkin donut... was too full for pie).  If you're staying at the hotel, the buffet is worth checking out. It seemed pretty clean, semi-new, and ok-pleasant (in that brightly lit, gluttonous sort of way).  At $30 a pop, I thought it could have been a little less expensive, especially after we ate at Carnival World Buffet at Rio, a buffet that's 10 times bigger and more popular, for only $22 each. However, this could have been the jacked price just for Thanksgiving. I'm not sure.  Btw, I really am not as thankful for gambling as I made it sound. I actually don't even like gambling. However, FOOD... oh yes. I am thankful. And thankful for the buffet for making food very abundant and accessible.  Thank you for buffets!!!",

However, in my opinion, the dessert is best part; with many ice cream flavors, cupcakes, eclairs, different cakes, mini donuts and cookies, you definitely will have a good time if you're a dessert person.",

I haven't eaten there since I was a young child and I can definitely see how other hotels have beat out T.I. in popularity, but this place really did not meet my expectations.   Our group of 3 girls got Dinner buffet \"discount\" tickets for $21 at the half off/tickets/shows/dinner booth. The selections at this buffet seem to be very limited and the food is pretty average. They do have crab legs, but they seem smaller and not as good, especially since we ate at the Rio Seafood Buffet the night earlier.   Tip: You can bring a plateful of the crablegs to the Asian food area and they'll steam the crab legs for you!  Other than that, very mediocre food. So mediocre I can only remember the little crab legs. I probably won't ever eat here again, although I did eat my $20 worth. Why not splurge a bit and go for the better buffets?",

I really don't recommend wasting time here, luckily it was only about $24/person during dinner and it killed time before our show, but still, I'm thoroughly disappointed.  Flavors is at Harrah's which is a couple of hotels down, that buffet is not the best, but it is *way* better than this one and it had more options.  This buffet really didn't have much and it displayed everything in such an unappetizing way, no effort at all.  We hadn't eaten all day so even some bad stuff should've tasted amazing haha, but I had to force myself to eat enough to be satisfied, womp womp :-(  I really can't recall my server either, so that must mean he or she was barely there because I recall every single other server from our trip.  What's more, where we were sitting, the tables were so close together it was hard to get in and out, I just really didn't enjoy our experience there, like at all, so now I know never, ever to stop in here, not that there's any other reason to be at TI to see Mystere and we did that, so yea I wouldn't go out of our way to come here next time even if I had a coupon!  I went to Le Village at Paris hotel and it was the best, even better than Bacchanal, and with the Groupon deal that seems to be going on indefinitely, it would be the same price as going here, so I'd invest in that and steer clear of here.",

We were here for the lunch buffet and I think they had just prepared the lunch menu because everything was fresh - even the sushi.  I wouldn't pick on the ones that have been sitting there that could be a disaster on your tummy.  I had the BBQ pork ribs and picked out the softest piece I could find - that was good, mac and cheese was not too rich, but creamy and tasty. The meatloaf was okay, but i wouldn't waste the calories on it.  The penne pesto was too oily that was prepared at the pasta station. Stuffing tastes exactly like it was made out of a box - I could have made that at home...wait, I have. Har gow was not bad, but I think they shrimp was chopped.  Tamale was okay similar to store bought in plastic bag.  My favorite is the Wycliff champagne, the full size moist red velvet cupcake, mini donuts, creme brulee - okay desserts were good, including the cotton candy.  The $14.95 price tag (+$3/pp for champagne) could be less, but what am i complaining about it was 2 for 1.  Don't get me wrong the restaurant is clean, modern and the food is okay and edible.  Why not take advantage of the vouchers when you stay?",

    "text": "I'd give 0 star if I could... The only reason I considered this buffet was because I was supposed to receive a complimentary 2-for-1 dinner voucher for the buffet with our hotel reservation.  Upon check in, we did not receive any of our coupons or promotions, or even reminded of any.   When we arrived at the buffet, we realized that we were supposed to receive a coupon. I spoke with the Manager of the buffet to see if he would allow us, all they had to do was just receive confirmation through telephone by calling the lobby.  The manager did not even seem to be the least bit interested in even talking to us. Sure enough, he did not even hesitate to tell us \"No, I'm the manager of the buffet, I'm not in charge of coupons.. go to the front desk.\" So he wanted us to go walk back to the lobby of the casino just to get some coupons that he should be able to validate with a simple phone call? \"Yes..\".   To make this short.. not worth getting into specifics.. we had received a dinner coupon voucher (needed lunch coupon voucher) at the lobby front desk. We figured its about 15 minutes until dinner (it was 3:45, dinner starts at 4), even that incompetent manager shouldn't have a problem with this. Just let us pay for the dinner price, which was in 15 minutes, DURING lunch. WRONG!   When the manager returned, (looked like he didn't want to talk to us) we told him our situation again. Before I finished a sentence the manager said.. \"We don't do this normally, but I don't want to deal with this anymore... since the front desk can't get it right go in.. I'll just wait until dinner time to charge you.\" Never again..   This is NOT a reflection of the hotel room or the servers at the buffet. I just wish that the MANAGER would have given us better service than what we received, which was close to nothing.",

    "text": "I should start by saying I'm not a big buffet fan, and the only reason I went here was because we got a 2 for 1 deal at check.  That said, with that the food at the buffet is all pretty good and replaced after a set amount of time even if it was all eaten, which means you consistently get fairly fresh food.    I ate their pho soup which tasted just as good as the soup at their viatnamese diner, and also had some of their BBQ.  Everything was good, but not great, and was really only worth it for the 2 for 1 deal.  The dessert was actually pretty awesome and the chocolate dipped macaroons were incredible.  Go here if you have the 2 for 1 deal and want a decent selection of OK food while in Vegas as it will boil down to roughly 10 bucks a person.  Other wise stay away as the total won't be worth it.  Finally, I had a huge problem with our waitress who was good, but made a snippy comment about me being cheap after I tipped her 5 bucks on a ticket of $24. Considering it's a buffet, we serve ourself, and she only refills drinks and busses tables, 20% was a good tip. You would figure in Las Vegas in this economy they we be thrilled to have a job and be getting 20%.",

On the other hand, I was impressed with the variety of foods they actually did have.  I was feeling queasy (shocking, Vegas?) so I couldnt mentally enjoy most of what I was seeing.  My red skin mashed potatoes with turkey gravy were bomb. The actual turkey was incredible and usually turkey sucks.  The egg drop soup had the best texture but way too many peas.  I couldnt think of eating a salad but the salad station was incredible. I liked that a person assembled your salads for you so no ones dripping elbow skin on top of the bacon bits.  As far as entree foods, I thought an improvement they could make is not have as large quantities sitting out because the texture changes and then its no fun.   The desserts were RIDICULOUS! We were seated right by them and it was torture. So many miniature desserts. It was so cool. I had a little cheesecake, a chocolate covered strawberry and a bite of mini donuts which only could have been better if they were hot.  The dudes loved the ice cream and cookies which I also couldnt stomach too much of. I did taste the ice cream and it was so super smooth and creamy. Tasted like Blue Bell.  Overall it wasnt bad. I would have been able to enjoy it a lot more if I hadnt been feeling like death. (:",

    "text": "This was my first (and so far only) Las Vegas buffet. Eating at a buffet was on my list of things to do, but it was not a very high priority. So how did we end up at TI?  It all started with standing in line at \"TIX 4 TONIGHT\" to buy tickets for any discounted show (we had already seen O). While in line we learned that we could also buy discounts for buffets. So for $2 we bought an $4 dollar discount, netting a $2 savings (final cost was $12 per person before tax and tip, $15 with tax and tip). Not that big of a deal, but a good enough reason to pick TI over any other buffet option, as it was the only discount available for Friday lunch and stopped the decision process right there (with so many choices, and 8 people, this was a good thing).   So how was it? Well I don't really have anything to compare it to (though later my brother and I did go take a look at the Wynn's dinner buffet. All I can say is WOW, it probably would have been worth the extra $10 per person for the lunch buffet at the Wynn). There were plenty of entrees from many different cuisines (Chinese, Japanese, BBQ, Italian, pizza, home cooking, Mexican, fish dishes, soups, salads and sides galore, as well as a very large dessert station, complete with cotton candy and a mini doughnut making machine).  Everything I sampled was OK. Other than the pot-stickers and the sushi, nothing was worth a second go, though I did eat everything I put on my plate. A few of the dishes, especially the pizza, were a bit salty, but not so bad that they could not be eaten.  Our server did a great job keeping our beverages full. I was not expecting beverages (non-alcoholic) to be included, but they were, so that was a nice surprise.  So in the end, it was an OK experience, but with so many other buffets in Vegas, TI's is not one I am likely to repeat.   One last bit of info: Parties of eight or more will get hit with an automatic 18% gratuity.",

Off to the side, and for whatever reason untouched. I walked over......no one else was around. I hesitate...thinking maybe this was not an included part of the buffet.... Perhaps these are for the pastry shop just outside....hmmmmm. What to do? Went ahead and loaded my plate thinking to myself I will play dumb if someone fusses at me.  Luckily, I was in the clear.....and oh my goodness. I wish I had started my meal with these pastries.....homemade miniature donuts topped with chocolate, caramel or powdered sugar....to die for!! These were somewhere between a traditional donut and a cake donut, and were like heaven in my mouth. Next, the gooey pecan cinnamon roll that literally melted in my mouth. The pecans were candied and crunchy and gave the roll just enough texture.....Lord, I almost paid for the buffet again the next morning just to have these pastries once more.    Definitely worth the price. Even better, we were full from the morning feast all day, and were able to skip right over lunch. So it really was a great deal afterall.",

I have NEVER heard this at a buffet before. Our group decided to split into two to avoid the gratuity and glad we did. Our waitress took so long - maybe she was picking the oranges and squeezing the juice herself.  FOOD - nothing really jumped out at you. Cold sushi rolls. Best part might be the made-to-order pasta option. Can't comment on much else because nothing left an impression.  DESSERT - probably the best part with the variety of donuts and they even have cotton candy. Their red velvet cupcake was so hard that I wonder if it was even from that day.

We came in for dinner so maybe thats why everything tasted bad....or maybe its actually bad...  Overall selection of food was pretty limited.  The Sushi: The rice was old. I mean there was no other way to say it. It was not fresh rice. If I make rice at home and 4 days later I unplug the rice cooker and leave the lid all the way open for 24 hours because i'm dumb like that, then slap a piece of fish on that crusty left-over rice and put it in the fridge for 2 hours to make it extra cold, then I'll have the same kind of sushi as I had at TI. It was bad.  The sea food was ok I guess. None of it tasted really fresh and it was all heavily seasoned/baked/slathered with stuff.  The crab legs were decent.  The potatoes tasted like they had been sitting out there for quite a while.  I couldn't bring myself to eat the dessert afterwards but the comments from the rest of the table were less than positive.  I'm not a buffet hater since I do go to buffets occasionally, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.  You better be plastered drunk AND a starving zombie to come in here and pay full price.

Good ham, mac and cheese, and corn bread, but that pales by comparison to the variety and quality of what you can get for the same $25 at some of the buffets I sampled on prior visits.

The desserts looked good, my husband said the cookies tasted like homemade.  The place was empty on a Wednesday night, so that should have been my clue.  Not cheap unless you have a coupon or a meal deal with show tickets.  Look around for another buffet where you get more for your money.",

    "text": "So similar to what another reviewer wrote - my group and I ate here solely because we purchased tickets at the TIX 4 TONIGHT booth and learned that you could get a discount on the buffet.  We were going to see Mystere that night, which is also at TI and figured we would cut the traveling time by eating dinner in the same casino.  That was a great idea, although I wasn't as impressed with the buffet as I wanted to be.  First off, the line took quite awhile to get through before we even paid at the register.  Maybe that's common in LV, but it's not fun when you're hungry.  The menu posted outside the restaurant had me salivating - everything sounded so good, and so many different items to choose from!  Could I really have beef with broccoli and pizza in the same meal?  Heaven.  But the reality fell short of the menu.  Yes, there were many stations to select from (pasta, sushi, pizza, chinese, soul food, etc) but just about everything lacked a \"je ne sais quoi\" that could have left me feeling more satisfied.  For example, I got a simple shrimp pomodoro, and it was tasteless.   How can that be?  With the garlic and basil that's supposed to be in it!  The only thumbs up I can give is to the soul food station and the dessert station.  The pulled pork, mac and cheese and sweet potatoes were de-li-cious!  And the dessert station had so much to choose from, that I thought to myself \"you should have skipped dinner and gone straight to dessert - besides, you are in LV on vacation!\"  :)",

They even had a sushi section that was fantastic!   Their steak was well done, no complaints there.  It was one of the better buffets I've had.  The only thing is that the waiter takes your order for drinks, other than that, you are good to choose anything of your liking, and they had just about anything you can ask for.  Polite service.  Overall, great experience, and I would absolutely go again!",

The sushi/sashimi section is very small, as is how I noticed all Vegas buffets seem to have. I skipped the pasta and pizza section for fear of getting full from carbs and focused mainly on the BBQ and meats section, which I think is definitely worth the visit. No one ventured near the salad station, but judging by the looks of the salad ingredients, everything looks fresh and crisp. Strangely, the snow crab legs area was very empty, but good for me, so I can indulge in them myself  :)  The dessert display is small and quaint, but all the desserts were very good and worth a second trip. While the buffet selection is smaller relative to some others, I think Treasure Island at least does what they have very well. Additionally, all service peoples are polite and respectful.",

You had to hunt for ones with meat, and most of them had just the thinnest strips of it left.  I'd feel better about eating at hometown buffet or McDonald's.  Service was... Odd.

The thing that killed it for me was the egg Benedict. I love egg Benedict but e hollidaise sauce. It was sour. Big disappointment. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs and was not impressed either. Boo.

Few dessert choices at lunch and not nearly as large of a buffet as the others I went to in Vegas.   Don't pay full-price! The half-price ticket booths sell discount coupons and you can save about 25% through them.

    "text": "A really bad buffet for the value. Went in on a Tuesday night in December 2015.  Their heating elements to keep things warm on the buffet table don't seem to work as well as any other buffet, everything was lukewarm. They charge $30 for a dinner buffet, they don't even have Crab legs or Shrimp cocktail !.  Also they don't even have the roast beef/prime rib carving station, all the meats are pre-cut sitting there waiting to get cold.  There is a lack of variety and a lack of options compared to other las vegas buffets.  It's just not a good deal.  Even most $20 \"budget\" Dinner buffets have better food and a greater variety compared to them.  Dessert's are the only saving grace of this place.  They have Dryer's scoop Ice Cream!  Scoop Ice Cream is hard to find in most buffets.    Outside of their desserts, this is a one-star buffet that is not worth the $30 price.  Save $10, go to a Budget Dinner buffet like the Gold Coast Hotel or Circus Circus and you'll have a much better experience.",

It is pretty pricy considering what you're getting - traditional Vegas up charge, but I still think it's still a bit pricy, even by Vegas Standards.   Me, I just had a couple of eggs, canned fruit, and a bowl of cereal. Personally in the future, if I have to eat on the cheap and quick - I would suggest considering a coffee shop oatmeal, fruit, and coffee. Or if you want to spend the budget - consider eating a famous French place that is listed in my Vegas list.",

    "text": "Terrible food and grumpy service.   The food selection was limited, considering it's a buffet. The knife provided could barely cut the dry roast beef, brisket and pork ribs. The cooked to order pasta Alfredo wasn't very tasty. They did have salad items including spinach and avocado which, without dressing, were the healthiest things I've eaten in Vegas. The rest was dodgy Chinese and Mexican but once a few of the drinks took hold it was ok. The dessert selection was better than the food, but unless you only want dessert I wouldn't bother.   We got the all you can drink package but the waiter who served the drinks was unattentive to the point of rudeness, literally turning away after seeing I signaled to him. He improved after a few polite responses but could offer little advice on what drinks were included except a guttural grunt of \"red wine white wine mimosa beer\".  The sparkling wine was drinkable though somewhat sweet, the red wine was truly awful. I think we got our money's worth but only through persistence.",

Also went to the pizza station, they made a special vegan pizza (no cheese, all veggie and pineapple pizza).  It was ready in less than 10 minutes, fresh.  Rainbow sorbet is always my favorite and I requested a bowl of strawberries on the side, all perfect.  I have no complaints.  I think the price might make people turn away, but if you get the food promo $80 for $100, I think it may be worth it.",

How do you mess up coffee and donuts? It's like everything's all processed and preserved to hell. I would only recommend going if you get a good deal and are planning to take advantage of the complimentary mimosa/bloody mary and will be eating from the omelette station since it's the freshest food there.

Hit the strip for a (possibly overpriced) buffet!  We hadn't been to Treasure Island in a lonnnng time, so the renovated buffet was a new experience for us. Our mid-week visit was mellow -- no line! Service (though not overly friendly) was polite, prompt and attentive.   Despite the low volume of guests, the cooks behind each station constantly refreshed the line with freshly-made items.   Some of the tastiest buffet choices were:  Short ribs with sweet potatoes  Chicken wings Buffalo chicken pizza Meatballs Farro salad Gelato Sugar free pies  The drink station is self serve and offers a full range of interesting hot, cold and sugar free options.  TI also provides free self parking, so we felt like we got our money's worth and enjoyed a satisfying buffet dinner without being nickel-and-dimed.",

The ONLY issue I had was the temperature of the food. Service was prompt and courteous, there was a lot of variety, the salad bar and sushi offerings were super fresh. My family and I really enjoyed the food. I will say there wasn't a carving area as other guests have pointed out but sliced meats were available and I think they do omelets at your request. one mistake I made was trying Mongolian beef thinking it was pepper steak. Good God! I'm 50 and have never in life had anything that spicy! I had to break my no sweets rule and get a scoop of ice cream to cool my.mouth down. I ended up getting a sample of vanilla bean and sugar free salted caramel...excellent. Not run of the mill custard machined. Anyhoo, not sure if my experiences at Corner VS Bellagio were one offs but I would come here again...Bellagio...meh, not so much",

I wish I could rate the breakfast and dinner buffets separately as they were completely different. While both had a great selection and variety, the breakfast buffet was ten times better than the dinner buffet. They have everything you could want in a breakfast, pancakes, french toast, waffles, sausage, eggs, fruit, pastries, and ton more. All of it quite delicious! On the other hand the dinner buffet was a tragedy. The meats were super fatty and dry. Their steak somehow managed to taste very gamey and left a terrible after taste. The coffee was sub par, but the cappuccino machine wasnt bad, even though only one flavor was actually working. The dinner selection had a lot of meats but they were all horrible. I only fully ate the turkey because it tasted great deapite being incredibly dry. All the beef and pork cuts were disgusting. It was nice they the staff never made us feel rushed to get out, so we got to make our meals quite leisurely. Definitely check them out for breakfast, but I suggest looking elsewhere for any other meal.",

We arrived in Vegas for Christmas week and decided to stop by this buffet for lunch because of good things we heard on YouTube. Big mistake and waste of money.   It was a Christmas brunch for more money than usual and it just meant they were serving cheap American style breakfast you can get anywhere. It was literally an upscale Hometown buffet from the food selection to the quality of the food....Our kids had one tiny plate of food each and they were done. (What a waste of money) They usually try multiple dishes but that tells us a lot.  The one thing that was better than the food was the molten lava cake with their ice cream.

I mean I have paid for low end buffets and granted I had a higher expectation for a casino buffet, but the meats/ protein tasted either undercooked or bland. The Peruvian chicken tasted like a rotisserie chicken which I honestly would have been satisfied just paying $6 for a rotisserie chicken from sam's. The bulgogi tasted like frozen burger meat that freezer burn. Parathas in the Indian section were hard, instead of light and fluffy despite being kept in a steamer. Rice was just oily. Brownie was soft, but didn't actually taste like a brownie. I have had most kind of brownies from zucchini, black bean ones, fudgy and cake like, but they tasted like a brownie. Most of any fried foods were hard and not crispy. The bananas were good. The front staff was great. You do serve yourself from everything to drinks to food. There was a cheesecake that was pretty decent. But all in all, this buffet has much to improve on. I don't expect high end meats, just tasty food.",

The lunch buffet cost $27. Which in my opinion the food wasn't that great for it to have that price!   We were a group of 8 and they seated us literally right in front of where the buffet started. While all the others got to sit in a nice comfortable area in the middle/back of the restaurant. To top it off they don't have restrooms in there. You have to exit the restaurant in order to go to the bathroom. If you are staying in the Treasure Island Hotel and want to eat there. Then be my guest. But other wise I would look for some other place to eat. I do not recommend this buffet. It was not worth $27 a person.",

The deserts were fantastic they even had gluten free options (although those were a bit dry) the staff was pretty unfriendly,  Our server was not very nice and seemed irritated he had to refill our drinks and pick up our food.  The dessert chef was kind of elitest but who cares, the food totally made up for it.  Pasta was incredible, pizza wood fired, sushi and crab leg options as well.  I wanted to visit Caesars Palace but the price was a bit high and we ended up here. Only reason this got a 3 star was due to the staff, most looked like they hated their life and hated their job more.",

Great for free, pretty bad if you fork over any money. Nothing really stands out, a lot of the food has been sitting out so it either gets mushy or dry. All the food is heavy with sauce, cream, breading, cheese or grease. Simply put you feel pretty gross after eating here. If you have the drunchies absolutely DO NOT eat here like I did, I can promise you you'll feel ten times worse.",

I would suggest forgoing the gnocchi pasta.  The dessert area was the best part because we got unlimited cotton candy, which was awesome. The pastry chef was real nice too.",

    "text": "Not recommended. I was visiting Vegas with my extended family, and we all wanted to go to dinner together the last night. There were three families, and we all wanted to pay separately (three bills), but sit together as a big group. We were staying at Treasure Island and we had some vouchers for the buffet, so this seemed like a good and affordable option. We had already paid this way at the Flavors buffet at Harrah's without issue.  So the lady we paid said the seating would be fine, but the hostess said no. Then she said we should talk to the manager. He told us no, they can't accommodate big parties like that, it's so busy, we would have to wait a long time, we really should just sit separately...on and on. My aunt pointed out that there were some empty tables within view, and a couple sitting nearby was finishing their dessert. Once they left, there would be 12 seats together and that would work perfectly. He was still like \"yeah, no...you would have to wait a long time...you should really just sit separately.\" She explained it was our last night in town and we all wanted to be together, and he suddenly asked \"well do you want to pay the gratuity then? There's a charge for big parties.\" Seriously first we had heard of this, the woman who we paid had not mentioned it.  It was clear we were getting nowhere, so finally my aunt said \"okay, we'll sit separately.\" He sortof rolled his eyes and responded \"THANK you.\"   So later one of the servers explained that if we had all sat at the same table in the same section with the same server, we would be counted as one big party, and would incur the large-party gratuity (I think it was 18%). This made total sense and she explained it very nicely- the manager should maybe take some pointers from the wait staff on how to interact politely with people. We told her the manager had been a jerk, and she didn't seem too surprised.  We ended up sitting at two tables of six very near each other, which worked out okay. The food was mediocre- my ham was good but the baked chicken seemed undercooked (pinkish red tint to the drumstick?). The mini donuts were delicious, as was the creme brulee.   The food was definitely not enough to make up for the rude manager. I will not go back.",

    "text": "$17.95 for lunch buffet. When we checked into the hotel they gave us a coupon for 2 for 1 lunch buffet! YES!!  Not too shabby! The cheap buffets are usually the good ones huh? Or maybe I just appreciate it more because it was cheaper!   I love the soup area! There were miso, wonton (3 pcs), shrimp with egg noodles, and even pho with 3 pieces of beef balls! The kind gentleman made my soup in less than 5 minutes! It came out piping hot! There were even fresh basil, green onion, cilantro, yellow onion, and lime! I ordered the pho & wonton. Wonton - 3 stars; it tasted like frozen wontons you get at the market. Pho - 4 stars; tasted decent, it tasted like it could have been \"instant pho\"  They had a salad station! 5 stars. The gentleman that was making the salad was not wearing gloves! It disgusted me! I really wanted a salad too! But as i worked my way down the area, there was another person making salad! She wore gloves and also had a mixing bowl where she was able to mix the veggies & dressing in! Whereas the dude smashing the veggies down with the palm of his hands and pouring the dressing over and calling it a day!   The sushi station was just sad! It didn't look fresh - 2 stars.  Chinese food area, I can't say much about since I didn't even make it to this area! Which is probably a good thing.   The BBQ station - 4 stars. BBQ ribs were too salty. Loved the biscuits & gravy, cornbread, pulled pork and chicken fried steak!   Desserts - 4 stars. The dessert station was on the other side of the restaurant. Weird. For a moment i really thought the only desserts they had were fruits! Luckily i walked around! There were tiny donuts! - maple with sprinkles, chocolate, powered, etc. made fresh and was very good! Also about 5 different flavors of ice cream; red velvet, chocolate, vanilla cupcakes; strawberry cheesecakes, cookies of all sorts - i was in heaven! I love desserts!   Overall, 4 stars.",

Got stuck with an 18% gratuity charge because apparently it's harder to pull plates on a table of 8 or more.  It must be because we ended up putting our used plates, after we had filled up a new plate and come back, on the table next to us.  After we were done eating they left the plates.    Desserts were the best part but not worth the $150 we paid for 2 adults, a 12 year old girl that doesn't eat much and a 10 year old.  No, we didn't order anything to drink other than water.

Since we stayed at treasure island, we received a 2 for 1 buffet ticket. $23.99 a person without the buffet ticket. Anyway champagne brunch is what it's called. I've eaten here before and they used to have pho but not today. Sad. But it's good if you're staying at treasure island and too lazy to eat elsewhere. It's also much cheaper than other places. If you're willing to spend $40+ a person for better food, then go elsewhere. This place is only worth it for the early risers and those who have the 2for1 coupon vouchers.   Food was boring. Just ham, pancakes, bacon, noodles, etc. Really basic stuff. Dessert was simple too.",

The omelet station is about the only thing that was decent. I tried food from all stations. Pizza gross, hash browns were mush, Chinese fried rice totally bland and just a bunch of rice tossed around with frozen cubes of carrots. For $24 a person it's a sham. We were out and about and decided to stop in TI to check it out- and have breakfast. REGRET going here, don't waste your time or money here.",

No idea how some folks could give this place 5 stars. Must be Vegas buffet virgins that don't know any better.   The food had been sitting there probably since lunch. Limp corn that tasted like it came from a frozen batch.   What a waste of my money! Take your $31.95 and go have lunch buffet at Wicked Spoon!

I came at 1145 on a weekday and they were sadly getting rid of the breakfast stuff already which is the hardest thing to mess up.   Unfortunately, replacing eggs, bacon, pancakes, and potatoes was a BAKED POTATO BAR. And I don't know about you but who gives a shit about baked potatoes. They have tons of toppings, but then again you don't go to a buffet to get a giant baked potato.  As for the \"regional BBQ\"... I have no idea lol I only tried the pulled pork and it was meh.   A lot of random, mediocre items throughout the buffet.  But again, if it comes with the hotel it's decent. Otherwise I would for sure never pay to eat here.   Service was outstanding.",

About a 10 min wait.  - I was more impressed with their dessert layout versus their other menu items. - Some of the items in the buffet looked like leftovers.  - If you want something more fresh, hit the Salad and Pasta stations.  - A good way to save some money on their dinner buffet is to arrive 30-40 mins prior to end of their Lunch or Champagne Brunch. Pay Lunch/Brunch prices and wait for the dinner buffet.   Viva Las Vegas!",

Sunday's are brunch all day, which includes bottomless mimosas, which is fun. I prefer the weekdays for lunch where half of it isn't breakfast food because breakfast food just fills you up too fast and then you don't feel like you truly got your money's worth. What's nice about this buffet is that they make the pasta and the salads right in front of you when you order it. That way you know it's extra fresh and hot. They also have a BBQ station and an Asian station, which includes both Pho & sushi. The desert station is what sets this buffet out because the deserts are to die for and there are so many to choose from, including cotton candy! I highly suggest!",

What NOT to get (-): The meat tasted really bad. They were left on the counter for a long time. The sushi was not fresh at all; they looked like they had just been taken out from the freezer.   (+) The only taste-worthy food here was the spaghetti. They were made on the spot and customized. The fried calamari was okay too. As for the dessert, the creme brulee was the tastiest of all. The chocolate cream puff was edible too. Cupcakes were extremely sweet, so were the chocolate pudding.  Service: Our server didn't seem to care about his attitude at all. When we asked for straws or napkins, he threw them on the table and left. Reluctant to take our drink orders as well. Maybe because most people forgot to tip them since the buffet is free.  Overall: Don't waste your time. Spend a little more and eat at somewhere nicer! This buffet is a joke.",

Denny's ran us over 15 dollars a person the day before and $20 a person at the Lux in the hotel for breakfast.  Bacon was crisp, eggs fluffy, salads were excellent, pastries fresh, lots of other items to eat, even make your own ramen noodles for breakfast!! They had fresh fruit smoothies too. We dropped in around 10am and they switched to lunch items around 11am.  Great if you only want to eat once a day.  If you stay at the Ventian like we did, don't miss out. Only a stone throws away.",

    "text": "Newly remodeled and refreshed, the Corner Market Buffet replaced the TI Buffet in the Treasure Island Hotel on the strip.  Went here twice for breakfast, and it was just the average fare with average selection.  Most items that I'm attracted to are made from frozen: potstickers, shumai, and empanadas.  $30.45 per person for Sat & Sun Champagne Brunch was $10 too much.  Highlights: ======== 1.  Service: very nice and helpful, smiley, all around from cashier to hostess to wait-staff. 2.  Texas Jalapeno Sausages 3.  Fresh juices and smoothies 4.  Raspberry scones 5.  Eggs to order: not any different than any other place, but it's not a low-light either!",

The Treasure Island casino is one of my favorite to visit because of the cool pirate ship theme. We came in and used our dining card that we got from Tix4Tonight around the strip, which by the way I highly recommend you get one. Originally I would've had to pay around $54 for me and my wife but I ended up paying $32 which was pretty awesome.  The service was great as a waiter would constantly stop by and get our plates or ask for assistance with anything. The food choices however are not many. I came in during lunch time so all they had was Chinese and BBQ. The BBQ choices were delicious but the Chinese options were not the best. The sushi is not good at all so if you are a big sushi person then don't bother with it. Their desserts are really good too so y'all should definitely check out their desserts. Overall it's a good buffet and one the cheapest in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I can't agree with most of the reviews here.   At $35 a person this isn't a value play but isn't a rip off either.   I've been to many buffets in Vegas some good some bad and this one isn't bad.  Service was excellent from the cashier and host to the chef and server.  Tyler was very courteous and hard working.   The dining area is spacious and very clean.  Now to food.   The selection is small but decent. I'd rather enjoy a few good options instead of many terrible tasting options! Am I right!?   The prime rib was on point. I like how the carving station is available for you to choose whether or not to get a pre sliced service or to wait for the carver to do his or her thing.   The peel shrimp, though small compared to what I've been used to consuming was fresh and tasty.  The dun-genus crab legs come pre sliced or pre cracked you can choose legs or claws.  They were tasty and quickly replenished when low.  I didn't try any of the other stations aside from the dessert and it was good. What I liked was that they used Dreyer's! There was mini churros and mini donuts as well as chocolate covered strawberries. I didn't see a chocolate fountain so I'm curious if these were brought it. Still good though.   Now to the drinks...   Whatever your heart desires, they've got it. From iced coffee, juice and sodas. For those of you who don't like soda, they also have several carbonated and flavored drinks which I appreciated.   I'll probably be back again as I played a bit in the casino.   I'll bring my appetite.",

Their sushi bar consist of about three varieties and it screamed \"don't eat me\". The Chinese food here makes Panda Express look gourmet. Their Singapore noodles was overly salty and tasted grainy from the curry powder. The Korean BBQ rib was very tough and bland. Their American style ribs and roast were very tough and dry.  Their Taco station was even worse..   The only saving grace here is the fresh salad bowl they mix and their desserts that was overly sweet but better than the rest. In fact, their dessert station had better variety and appearance than the rest of their food.  For $30, I was expecting a lot more ...",

    "text": "I used to like the old TI buffet, Dishes, but it apparently went downhill in my absence during the years I was not dining at it.  The new buffet, The Corner Market buffet, subscribes to the adage \"less is more,\" and delivers some tasty food, some of which is described as \"comfort\" food (for example, chicken pot pies).  We had lunch here only, and there was no carving station.  The best food, in my opinion, were the Asian chicken wings and the chicken pot pie.  The salads were very fresh too - I had them make me a wedge salad with no bacon, and it was great.  The rest of the food - there wasn't anything bad, but nothing that stood out as exceptional either.  At the end of the meal, they have some decent Apple Strudel (have to ask for the whipped cream - ever since \"Inglourious Basterds\" il faut \"attendez la creme!\"), but very little fruit (just some cantaloupe and watermelon).  They had some other desserts that looked good but did not try.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Over all, for the price, it is not a bad buffet.  Perhaps not the best in Vegas, but then it costs \"only\" 27. per person for lunch, which is half the price of some other Strip buffets.  Also, as noted, everything at the buffet is fresh and tastes like what it is supposed to taste like, so it does deliver a satisfying although not necessarily memorable, meal.",

I expected, from past experiences at other casino's buffet menu, to have the food prepared at a high standard, especially at the price paid. The food was dry from the heat lamps and the choices inadequate; but most importantly, the food was just not tasty and very common. Nothing special, much like hospital or school food. Not chef-quality food. I do not recommend. Buy a hot dog around the corner and save so",

I told the cashier gently and nicely that we were in fact in front of these couples and she rudely asked us what we wanted.  The cashier (an elder caucasian) women then said \"wow, you must be really hungry\".  My boyfriend nor I are even slightly overweight but her inclination is that we were either COWS or that we were SO RUDE to stand up for our much awaited position in the line.  When we were waiting for the hostess, the cashier actually apologized to the rude couples for our behavior!!!? What?    The night before we ate here as our dinner was included with show tickets and we were staying at the hotel and our drink order was never taken.  Eventually the manager came to us as I think he noticed and apologized profusely and proceeded to serve us throughout the rest of the meal which we thought was nice.  However, the food for lunch was the same and as mediocre as the dinner.  We felt somewhat duped after staying for two days in their \"nicest\" suit to then be treated like this.  Need I say more?",

When paying $26 for a on the strip buffet I expect some really good food, but Id rather eat a $16 buffet off he strip then here.  Almost all the food seem liked \"filler\" food such as rice, bread, pastas, it had a very bland selection and almost no unique dishes. The meats that they served were ok, but again lacked something to make this place special or above the rest. And the desert section was nothing to be proud of either.  Overall you will be paying $26 for rice, bread and fruit. Skip this one if your looking for a cheap buffet off the strip I like the fiesta at Sunset Station.",

All in all, it was a very good meal at a very good price.  As far as mid-to-low priced buffets go, TI's is pretty good. They had a good selection of food. You had your 'Asian' section, 'American' section, 'Italian' section and 'Salad' section. I kind of felt they were missing a 'TexMex'-type station, but ultimately I wasn't missing it all that much. In particular I appreciated that the salad station would custom-make salads for you - that was a bit of a nice touch.  Everything I put on my plate during 'Round 1' I enjoyed. During 'Round 2,' I picked out a few things I didn't know if I'd like, but more-or-less just wanted to 'sample' and as I recall, everything during 'Round 2' was so-so. I don't know if I can fault the food so much as me being somewhat full by then and having already eaten the things I REALLY liked already. Nothing tasted old or reheated though. It was all pretty fresh and tasty.  But the winner WAS the dessert section. Talk about selection!! By the time I got over there, I kind of wish I'd STARTED with dessert, cause there was so much to choose from - cupcakes, pies, cookies, ice cream, tarts, puddings, creme puffs, chocolate-covered strawberries, cotton candy even!! My friends and I all got several and sampled one another's items, just to get a taste of as much as possible. THE WINNER WAS THE CREME BRULEE! It was DELICIOUS!!! If I wasn't so full by the end, I would've liked to eat 3 of them.. Alas, I could only eat one serving. But it was YUM.  I'd rate this place a solid 3 stars, but they get an extra star for the dessert section alone. For the price we paid, this buffet was very good.",

Needless to say, I was disappointed in the dessert options so that almost immediately ruined the whole buffet for me.  Luckily I wasn't paying so that managed to keep me open minded enough to eat.  The food should at least look freshly prepared but much of what I saw looked like it sat under the heat lamps for most of the night, and it wasn't even that late yet.  It'll fill you up and the price isn't ridiculous, but I prefer the buffet at Bellagio.  Unless someone else is paying, I probably won't return.",

The buffet setup is make sure you have to wait in lines for everything, or ask someone for a simple salad. So, longer line, less people to get in and cut down the loss. In other words, free coupon, but we don't want your business. You have to wait to get in and wait to get food. SMART !",

    "text": "I always try to look for the best out of a place, but it was difficult to find the good in the Treasure Island buffet. We decided to try it because we had the 2 for 1 coupon from the hotel, against my better judgement after checking yelp. The place was clean and simply decorated so we felt comfortable. The first problem was that there was a long hair in the tongs to get pulled pork, when my husband told the person behind the counter he just smiled and said \"ok.\" We tried a little bit of everything from the BBQ section, we got slices from the pizza station, and salads from the salad station. All of the meat was dry and visibly old. You could tell it had been sitting for an extended period of time. The pizza tasted worse than Chuck E. Cheese, and the Cesar salad dressing was salty and tasted horribly. The dessert was ok. We had some cookies and sweets and they weren't bad. Another thing that I didn't like is that I heard the waiter in our section speaking very rudely to tourists who didn't know much English, which I find extremely offensive. We were so annoyed and disappointed with the experience that went to complain but there was already someone complaining and yelling not at the manager that we didn't want to wait. Needless to say we will never go back to this buffet or recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Oh, T.I.  You should be ASHAMED to even call this a \"Buffet.\"  We got comped, so we checked it out, and decided \"What the heck.\"  Unfortunately, we'd checked it out at late breakfast time, and actually did the whole \"Eating\" part at dinner.  Breakfast, if small in selection, at least looked decent.  Dinner?  Oh.  Em.  Gee.  First of all, I really hope EVERY person (all 6 of them) at the buffet that evening were also Comped. Because seriously?  If I'd paid $22 for that \"Selection\" of foods, I'd be calling the Better Business Bureau and reporting fraud.  Ok, so: The decor is contemporary. It looks chic.    That's where it ends. Let's take the tour:  Sushi \"Bar\": Actually a mostly-empty shelf with saran-wrapped platters of old, oxidizing nigiri behind glass next to a shelf of mini-plated with 2-3 Nigiri apiece on them. The \"Fish\" (Salmon and Tuna, presumably)  was happily decomposing...(I mean \"OXIDIZING\" but that's the first step) atop the solid riceballs. The dark coloration of the Salmon was disgusting, and I walked right past it.  Next Station: The \"Confused\" Station.  Grape Leaves, Hummus, and Olives... with Seaweed/Krab and vinegar \"Salad\" and some other randomness. Got the Grape Leaves and some Hummus. They were actually the best taste we had of the entire \"Buffet\"... and they were pretty mediocre.  Then came the \"Chinese\" Station. Some LoMein, Fried Rice, \"Kung Pao\" chicken, Beef and Broccoli, Stir Fried something, and a Pho Station.  Cool... some Pho. Or not... since 3 out of the 4 bowls were non-pho soups. (WonTon, Ramen Noodle...Don't know what else...)  I got a bowl of the Beef Tendon Pho. The broth was actually decent, but there were no \"Pho-courtiments\" like basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, fish sauce...Nada. Take it as it is.  Also:  The \"Tendon\" was also Tripe. Mainly Tripe.  Sigh.  Beyond that, it was the \"BBQ\" section.  Pork Spareribs in a Pile under a Heat Lamp (really.)  Skunky Mac'N'Cheese, Undercooked Collards, Mashed Sweet Potatoes with NO flavor... and \"BBQ BEEF BRISKET.\"  Which would be fine, if it were not the EXACT SAME BEEF that was labeled right next to it, in a steam pan with gravy, as \"FLANK STEAK\"... AND... over in the MEXICAN Section? SAME MEAT Labeled as \"Carnitas\"!!!  What. The. HELL??? There was probably more at the \"BBQ\" area but I'd moved on.    Then there is a refrigerated salad station where they'll make you one of their pre-set \"Salads.\" I had to BEG for just a couple of the Fresh Mozzarella Balls... since they were \"Locked Up\" behind the glass instead of on display so that people might actually EAT THEM. There WAS a \"Cheese Plate\" which looked like something they'd bought at Costco and set out. Charming.  I'm skipping something here, but I can't remember what. At breakfast it was the Omelette station. At Dinner, it apparently was unappetizing enough to drop from my memory. Coming up to the Pasta Prep Station. They have old, hard, cold \"Display\" plates of their offerings.  Even if I had been hungry enough (or brave enough) to want to try their \"Creations\".... those plates would have been deterrent enough.  Gross.  And last is the \"Mexican\" themed bar. \"Carnitas\" consisting of the same \"Brisket\" err... I mean \"Flank Steak\"... Yeah.  And Osso Bucco... except that it was all BONES and one teeensy sliver of the Osso Bucco meat. (To it's credit, the meat was tender.)  There was also dried Mexican rice.  And some other stuff.  Again, it didn't warrant me remembering what it was.  Obviously we didn't eat much of what they had to offer.  But it was comped, so at least we'll get some coffee and desserts out of it...  Ohhh, strike that. Coffee Machine Broken. Natch.  Well.  So the desserts. Usually the desserts are the shining star of even a mediocre buffet. But I forgot:  This place can't even qualify as \"Mediocre.\"  This place is downright BAD. With desserts to match.   The \"Fresh Donuts\" were... well... let's just say there was no deep-fryer in sight, and the \"Fresh\" donuts that *weren't* out for the grabbing were set on a 3-tiered plate, rotating under a HEAT LAMP.  Uh-Huh. The cupcakes LOOKED pretty, but also LOOKED plastic... and probably tasted the same. I wouldn't know. The Creme Brulee was caramelized on top.. sort of. I tried one... and the vanilla pudding beneath was... lacking. In flavor and texture.  I grabbed a Fruit Tart, too, and it had the same filling as the Brulee, but without the faux-caramelization. They had a Cotton Candy machine. It was neat to look at. That's about it. Their Ice Cream was Edy's... which is better than average as far as branded Ice Creams go, so the Man had some Dulce De Leche.  The whole experience was pretty sad.  Seriously, if I'd PAID for this junk, there would have been screaming and demanding and threatening.  There are a Gabillion Buffets in Vegas.  Don't waste your time and money at this one.  For less than HALF the price, you can hop the tram to the Mirage, and have a HUGE Corned Beef Sandwich that'll feed you for 2 days.",

    "text": "FOOD POISONED!    My wife and I were having a great day in Vegas today.  We were suckered though into a \"deal\" to eat at TI, saving approx 15 bucks.  Good deal?  We think not.  My wife got the hummus, some of the other Greek items, shrimp and a couple of fruit tarts.  When we left we ended up having to rush into a taxi because my wife started feling ill (we had planned on walking back to our hotel).  When we arrived at the hotel, my wife had to rush back to our room and spent the next hour or so throwing up.  We are pretty sure it was the shrimp.  She was feeling GREAT before eating here, so we're positive something was wrong with the food. I called the mgr, who politely told me that he didn't think it could be food poisoning because food poisoning doesn't set in an hour after eating bad food.  He said we could file a report, but we didn't want to waste anymore time on this place.  Please be careful what you eat if you eat here.  Some of the food looked like it had been out for a while.  The salads are pretty good and the desserts are so-so.  Overall though, in hindsight, it was a really bad idea.  My wife's stomach is still hurting her pretty bad right now (6 hours later).  I'm going to try and get a refund tomorrow.  If my wife is still sick tomorrow I guess we'll file a report.  I really hope we can just forget about TI though.  They've wasted enough of our time already on this trip.  This is my first review on yelp.  Sorry to start off as such a complainer, but I really felt it was necessary to get the word out on this place.",

    "text": "LET'S BE TRUTHFUL...   Last week I decided to treat my wife to an evening of pretending to be a tourist on the Strip. I booked a room at the TI and after check-in, took my hungry bride to the buffet to graze on a strip buffet offering. I stepped up enthusiastically feeling fortunate there was no line and paid the $23 per person to get in.   As we walked through the dining area I noticed about 18 diners in the restaurant (odd for a 7:30pm dinner I thought) who were not really eating much. Must be a convention of health nuts as most plates were fruit and snacks... no real food. We arrived to the line and my wife looked at me and said...   \"Is it just me, or does this entire place look tired?\"   I thought to myself and replied, \"Sweetie, I don't understand why all the hot food has a dried skin on top, the cold food is shriveled, and the employees are all frowning... but that doesn't effect how much fun we'll have tonight, right? After seeing her expression, I immediately stated that we were leaving and requested a refund from the overly understanding lady at the register.   Notwithstanding the terrible looking food, the strain on the faces of the line cooks resembling a Hollywood production of someone pointing a gun in their backs to work there or else... I found the saddest part to be how unfazed and prepared the smiling lady at the register was when I asked for a refund. We left, walked across the street to the Palazzo and enjoyed a great Italian dinner.   PERSONAL NOTE TO PHIL RUFFIN, OWNER OF THE TI  I was born and raised in Las Vegas, and this was my first experience staying in a strip hotel/casino. I'm proud of our city and welcome every visitor with open arms to enjoy all the entertainment and great dining Las Vegas has to offer. This buffet, the air quality in the casino, the poor cleanliness of the room, (our room had burnt out light bulbs, yuck on the dresser, broken dresser drawer hanging out, and empty alcohol bottles under the bed and chair) and the lack of smiles on the employees faces is not what I envisioned any tourist should experience. When this property opened it was fantastic, enjoyable, and affordable, and most important the air was breathable. When we arrived in our room, my wife had to do a breathing treatment because the horrible air inflamed her Asthma. Perhaps you'll take these recommendations to heart?  If you have a similar experience at this or any other Las Vegas property, please write a truthful review so the hotel owners get the message and step up their game. I would be happy to stay at the TI again and perhaps encounter an experience deserving of a glowing review, which I would be proud to post. Until then...",

With the coupon, we paid $20 for two people however without the coupon, it's $18-20 per person for breakfast or lunch.  For being a buffet in Vegas, in a major hotel/resort, I was expecting so much more. Yes, they had a pretty good selection of foods, from American to International, but I feel like they didn't go the extra mile like other buffets would.  The boy and I were immediately drawn to the BBQ station, we had: -Pulled Pork -Cornbread -Biscuits -Mashed Potatoes -Macaroni & Cheese -BBQ Chicken  Our favorites were the pulled pork, BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cornbread. Both the pulled pork and chicken had great sauces and were both sweet and spicy. The mashed potatoes were good, really fluffy. Cornbread was sweet and moist, I was so happy that it wasn't dry! The macaroni & cheese wasn't that great to me, maybe it was the type of cheese that was used, but it came across as more of macaroni in a cheese sauce than a more traditional macaroni & cheese.   Overall, I think this is a great option if you are staying at Treasure Island, especially during the week so you can use the coupon. However, with more high-end buffets on The Strip and with the other delicious options in the hotel itself, this just wasn't too memorable.",

Display food sitting in front of each station looked like it had been there for weeks.  The pasta served at the pasta station was watery and overcooked.  The meat at the BBQ station tasted like it had been made the week prior.  There are much better buffets in Vegas.  It's worth it to pay a little more to go elsewhere.  I recommend taking the tram over to the Mirage for their Cravings Buffet which is much better.",

So I believe it was close to, or about $30 per person? Nonetheless, it was about a 15 minute wait. The food was decent. I liked the pasta station. I just like picking out the different pastas that I could try out. The asian corner was alright. Living in Garden Grove, their Pho was quite mediocre. I liked the Snow Crab legs though. They were tasty, and I couldn't get enough of them! Dessert was okay. I was pretty full by the time I got to the desserts, so I only managed to grab a stick of Cotton Candy to go!",

    "text": "We spent a week in Vegas and tried a different buffet each day. We enjoyed this buffet quite a bit. The food was really good and high quality, except for the prime rib which was all very well done - pity.  My husbands favorite part was the pasta bar. You choose your pasta and your sauce and they mix it all there in front of you in the little pan (with any veggies that are part of it, if any) so it is freshly put together and very tasty. He went back 3 times for different combinations and they were all good.    They also had a salad bar where a cook puts it together for you. I was odd that you didn't do this yourself, but it had great stuff such as fresh avocado, real bacon, several fancy cheeses, etc.  The sushi was better most of the other buffets we went to. There were crab legs and shrimp. They were good, but I was bummed that the crab legs were not already cut, you had to break them open yourself.  The desserts were the best that I had at any of the buffets. We had done the 24 hour buffet of buffets previously (a good deal) and discovered that all of the Harrah's buffets had the same mediocre desserts at each.  But here they had REALLY good creme brulee, tarts, fresh made little donuts, and good ice cream. They also had the cotton candy that was popular with most of the buffets now (except I didn't have to beg for it like some of the other buffets).  In summary, other buffets did have more variety, but we like good quality. So it depends on your goal. If we had the kids with us, they would probably like a different buffet better. We would return to this one next time we are in town.",

Their meat selection is pretty wide, with a carving station with at least two meats (we had lamb, prime rib, and turkey), the standards in cold seafood such as cold snow crab legs and cocktail shrimp, and a good selection of dessert.  I certainly won't compare it against the big boy buffets, but for the price, its actually a good value.",

We haven't tried that many breakfast buffets in Vegas but after stumbling upon this one this is a must for us at least once whenever we come to Vegas.  Our recent trip for breakfast did not disappoint.  The hubs absolutely loves the eggs at this place and they are tasty.  Yeah, i know they're just eggs but yummy!  Being filipino, I love how they serve longanisa and rice.  And with the eggs added to that it makes a delicious filipino-style breakfast.  They have all the standard fare for breakfast (bacon, corned beef, eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, etc.) and it's all delicious. And their mini donuts in a variety of flavors (powdered, chocolate, sprinkles, cinammon) are fresh and delicious.",

My problem is that the waiters at TI didn't do anything other than removed dirty dishes, we got  are food, we got are drinks, we got are desserts. and if it was their job to take away dirty dishes from all the tables in the area what does it matter who was sitting at them.  we didn't ask to move any tables, just keep us in the same area. this was bad but the food was worse.

Let's just say she has an under-developed palette, Chinese food = orange chicken and Mexican food = cheese enchiladas.  We stayed at TI and one evening after a long day of workshops and speeches, we wanted to just get something to eat downstairs at our hotel. We wandered around surveying our options. Unfortunately, we landed here because the boss was afraid to commit to any one particular genre of food and because she was afraid of not liking her food. Since she holds the company credit, we ate here.  It was gross. See Greg O.'s review for a good description of what the food and atmosphere are like. He is spot on - tired and shriveled up are the words to best describe this place.  I don't go to Vegas often, but I've been enough to know that the only buffets here worth going to are the pricey ones. I knew by the lack of a line and the $23/person price for dinner that this was going to be bad. And it was.  Anyways, complete waste of time and food. Complete obligatory food and empty calories. Didn't look good. Didn't taste good.  Pros: offerings from allover the globe, no line, low price-point, friendly manager, dessert wasn't terrible.  Cons: food has clearly been sitting out for longer than it should, the food, bussers were a bit slow to pick up our dishes.  Definitely not going back.",

The Eggs Benedict was pretty good if you got a piece with a thick slice of ham on it. I liked the scrambled eggs, which weren't overcooked. The desserts were delicious. Nothing like a strawberry shortcake parfait for breakfast! Remember to go toward the dessert area for cold cereals and fresh fruit.   This was much more cost effective than The Coffee Shop restaurant also located inside Treasure Island.   I would come to this buffet again if I stayed at Treasure Island agani.",

I could go on and on about how gross it was, but then I would be neglecting the beverages. The coffee tasted like they used dirty water to brew it; the orange juice was a weird flavor- bitter??- and the water tasted like pool water. The Pepsi was, well, Pepsi so I guess that was ok. The strange thing was the line was ridiculously long, the place was empty once inside, and the price was more than the buffet at MGM Grand, which, by the way, we found to be delicious with a wide variety of offerings.",

The breakfast setup is great, they have an omelet bar where you can get a custom made one or eggs to order.  The bacon was really good too, they also had french toast, pancakes and hash browns.  At 11:30 they change over to lunch which included a variety of BBQ and Chinese food items.  I tasted the orange chicken which was pretty good.  The best part are the desserts, they had a number of options like chocolate macaroons, strawberries and their freshly made mini donuts.

First of all I don't really want to have crappy champagne or forced into a brunch. If they want to have brunch so they can charge more that's fine but there should be a non-champagne offer for $4-$5 less. So in to the review. Ham and turkey not bad. Biscuits were not hard.  Coffee was decent. Meats were very tough. Even to cut with a knife. I would have given 2 stars but my server was attentive enough and I'm smart enough to avoid the questionable items. My dining experience was not terrible. The food is not terrible. Take very small portions to figure out what's good and bad would be my advice. Since I'm a very small eater paying $35 for a plate of mediocre food doesn't justify 4-5 starts. If you have a hearty appetite and like cheap champagne and mimosa then you are safe!",

So with 3/5 of us paying full price for the weekend champagne brunch, on average it cost $17.48/person, which was definitely worth it. I mean, everything is overpriced on the strip, and there is literally a hot dog stand a couple minutes' walk away on that floor in TI selling hot dogs for $15. Here we got unlimited food, drinks, and champagne!  The people working here were really nice, but the food was okay but not great. I've been to some nice buffets in Vegas (Wynn FTW!) and obviously TI can't really compare, it's not exactly super luxury. However, with the vouchers, we basically paid half price. I would skip the sashimi, but some of the sushi, the fried food/fatty meat, and the noodle soups (pho!!) are okay. They have grapefruit juice! The dessert bar is in the back, so don't miss it. They also had cotton candy, which was fun!",

Pluses:  a \"salad\" station where they customize salads for you; sushi station where they make basic sushi rolls and such; pasta station where they cook-to-order pasta dishes.  Pizza for the kids.

I would typically pay a few more dollars for a higher end buffet (Wynn, Cesar's, Wicked Spoon) but with the holiday weekend all of those places had double prices breakfast buffets!  The good: -ready made omelettes with standard choices of veggies and meats (no seafood) -the vast dessert bar including fresh made and glazed donuts, cinnamon buns, and croissants -they have mango lassis! (So random)  The bad: -we arrived early and the buffet was almost empty. However, the hostess had everyone wait and created a long line for no reason. We waited 30 minutes; what a waste.  -the sushi bar has no raw fish. It's spam and smoked salmon and sausages rolled up in some rice and seaweed.  Everything else (eggs, pancakes, waffles, etc) were about average.   Overall, there are much better (and more expensive) places to grab breakfast!",

Weekday dinner was about $25, so split amongst 3 people and 2 free vouchers, it was only about $9/pp which is a STEAL for food let alone buffet in Vegas!  At a certain point, food is food.  It's definitely not the best buffet in Vegas as I've tried several, but for what it was, I think it's worth coming for if you're a frugal newly 21 year old or even someone that doesn't care much about food and literally eat to eat AND have one of those 2 for 1 or complimentary vouchers.  Otherwise, don't bother at all if no voucher, not really worth the $25.  Towards the left, there was a tiny \"seafood\" section where they had about 3 different sushi rolls, and some cold mixed salads.  Moving over, there's an assortment of \"asian food\" (fried rice, chow mein, broccoli beef, orange chicken), a soup bar (pho, dumpling soup), bbq (+ your standard mac and cheese, mash potatoes kinda sides).  Down the line, there's also pizza and a salad bar, and pastas along with a baked potato bar (grilled chicken, mushrooms, cheese, chili, etc) at the very end.  There's also a dessert table of some cakes and pastries along with chocolate covered strawberries at corner right.  If you've been to a Hometown Buffet in California, it's pretty much like that.  I only really semi-approve of the pasta and soup bar, and some of the asian foods.  But that alone is not worth the $25, so again, only go here if you have a voucher.",

By 3:30 I was vomiting like crazy. My wife did not have the dumplings, and she did not ever get sick, so I am almost certain this was not a stomach bug.  I called them back after a couple of weeks to check on the report I had filed, and they said no other person complained. Well here's the thing, with big companies, what does their legal team tell them to do? Deny everything and never admit to fault.  I am almost forty years old and I know when I have food poisoning.  I had to go to the Doctor while on vacation, and he agreed that, YES, my symptoms were in line with food poisoning. When I talked to Ashley from Treasure Island about the incident, she said basically that I could not prove that I got food poisoning there, and that is True, I can not go back and time and get a pork dumpling and send it into a lab for testing.  Sucks my first time in Vegas was ruined by poor food handling.  I will not be going here again.",

I'd never been to a casino dinner buffet before so I didn't really know what to expect quality-wise. I walked around & first got a plate of their \"American BBQ\" items. They seemed very bland so I decided to try again. Meh, not much better the second time with the pizza & other small items.  I saw a lot of people at the pasta line so I figured I'd give it a shot. This time, I was satisfied. I got the lobster ravioli tossed with mushrooms in an alfredo / tomato-based sauce. It was delicious. I wish I wouldn't found this first because I probably would've just gotten two helpings of pasta! The desserts were also pretty good. There was a large variety and I tried out a few different things that I enjoyed. One of the highlights was the apple bread pudding.  Would we stop again? With as much as Las Vegas has to offer, probably not, but it's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the hotel anyways.",

I went here on a Sunday night, feeling kind of disappointed for letting my out of town friends pick the restaurant for dinner. However, for 24 bucks, we got a pretty decent selection of food. Absolutely no wait, clean, and pretty good service.   My street creds: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

When we walked in, we felt totally boss having received 4 comped dinners (normally the price is $28/person).  Now I see why they literally had to give the meals away.  The smoked trout was extremely fishy, while the stuffed flounder was rock hard.  The BBQ pork was extremely dry, essentially a victim of the intense heat lamps Crab legs were present, but were not Alaskan king crab, and was dripping in water with each crack of the crab leg Prime rib was tender, but lacking flavor Peel and eat shrimp was ok Average variety (Vietnamese, Chinese, BBQ, salads to order, pizza, pasta station) It gained the second half star for the desserts. The Creme brulee was acceptable, and the mocha-flavored ice cream was enjoyable.   Again, only worth coming if comped.",

The decor is unlike any buffet I have seen.  It seems more like an upscale, intimate restaurant than your typical cafe style buffet.  They have different stations featuring (my favorite) fresh sushi, wood fired pizza, made-to-order salads and pastas, BBQ ribs and chicken, and without question the best dessert choices I have seen anywhere!  While there may be higher quality food at some of the (much) more expensive buffets in town, for the price you pay at TI, this one offers the best value in terms of service, decor, food choices and excellent desserts!",

    "text": "Lunch was the \"FAIL-BOT\". What is a \"fail-bot\", pray tell? Imagine a robot designed with the sole purpose to fail. Who would design such a robot built to never accomplish anything? I can't tell you for sure, but chances are they had a hand in my culinary experience at the Buffet at Treasure Island.   Now let's set some ground expectations. 1.) I'm in a casino on the Vegas Strip, expect to pay through the nose for food and drinks. 2.) Buffet = Food cooked some time ago. 3.) ... I'm bored, let's move on.  There are certainly a fair share of buffets on the Las Vegas Strip that will cost you between $20-30 for lunch or dinner, they all have food out and heated, and they all come with a wide assortment of regional foods. Lucky for me this particular meal was on my boss because the food was close to appalling (and I enjoy buffets).   The sushi had been sitting out to the point that the rice was beginning to harden. Asking the sushi station chef for a fresh plate was out of the question as the station was left unattended for the duration of my meal. OK, so sushi buffets are often a sub-par experience to sitting at sushi bar and having a chef slice and roll to your very heart's content, surely there are some other delicious items to sample? The bbq ribs were not bad and neither were the Korean short ribs. The beef brisket was tough and the accompanying bbq sauce resembled something I once dipped a Chicken McNugget into. The Asian food station was likely my greatest disappointment. Simply and seriously put, I have had higher quality food at Panda Express. Enough of the bad? I will say that the service staff was polite and attentive. At the dessert station I was greeted by a very pleasant woman named Olga, who was not only friendly, but recommended the creme brulee which left a sweet note on what was certainly a bitter dining experience.  I will admit that buffets can often be made or broken on timing, however in Las Vegas with the myriad buffets available and the $20+ /person price I was sorely left with my expectations completely unsatisfied. I expect that at that price I'm not only paying for the variety of food, but also paying for someone to keep the food fresh. If you are dead set on a buffet on the Las Vegas Strip, skip  Treasure Island and give Spice Market (Planet Hollywood) or the Buffet at the Bellagio a try. Same price, better variety, and far better food.",

For all meat lovers (like me), the different types of BBQs (like pulled pork, ribs, smoked meats, etc) were just great, with different types of BBQ sauce.  The BBQ meats were all juicy and flavorful.  I don't really miss prime ribs when I get to chow on mountains of delicious BBQ pork.  They also had cotton candy - great for my daughter.  There weren't any fancy desserts, but ice cream and whatever other cakes they had were good enough for us. The service was also friendly. While I consider Wynn to have the best quality, TI has the best value overall.  I would definitely go back again.",

The food is flavorful, and there is a decent variety. Many of the other buffets have more food, but I don't think the food is as good. I would rather have a few less options and have them taste better. There is a good range of food, including sushi, pizza, ice cream, salads, and BBQ. There is plenty for a vegetarian, and they make the salads to order. They usually have an omelet bar, and their desserts are good too. They even have cotton candy! I am a picky vegetarian, but I always leave feeling stuffed. The lines have not been nearly as long as the other buffets, which is a bonus as well, and the serving staff has always been extremely friendly, which I absolutely love and appreciate.

    "text": "There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.  Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.  The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.  My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.",

Total for the buffet using the buy 1 get 1 buffet coupon - $25.89.We got there right as dinner started thinning everything would be fresh, WRONG. First of all their selection of food was very disappointing. The beef rib roast and pork ribs were tough and dry. The sushi was the worst the rice tasted like it was a week old. They advertised crab and shrimp but there was none. The only thing that was eatable was the lobster raviolis. To top it off when we tried the deserts we were just as disappointed. All of the cakes or cookies were hard and dry and they didn't have any gelato only cheap ice cream. Even though we only paid 25.89 for both meals I wouldn't go back there if it was free. The second night we went to Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace that was fantastic.",

The ribs & the deserts were ok at best there was a hair in my Pho soup the service was horrible everyone was rude starting at the desk. It's awkward to walk in once you pay, you have to excuse yourself threw other paying customers. The woman who sat us seemed irritated upon entrance we asked for an extra chair which she replied \"Well can I give you your set ups first\" in a very snotty way then walked away. The lady's at the salad station were the only nice people there. It was very disappointing especially at 30 a person for a family of 7. I will gladly pay that price at a place with worth coming to. Not a great selection of food, overly spiced or completely bland no in between. I'm sad I chose to come here.",

Presentation is a lot better than most casino buffets, but as with any other buffet, food is prepared for the masses, so you cant expect a 4-5 star meal folks.  I probably wouldnt pay the price on a normal day, but if you're in Vegas, you're most likely a tourist and are going to be price gouged anywhere on the strip.  It's like visiting a theme park or going to the movies.  Ridiculous prices, all for convenience and to bump up profit margin to keep these places open.  If you're looking for a cheap meal, then rent a car and eat off the strip. Other than that, we happened to be there on seafood night, so we got to stuff our faces with mountains of snow crab, so we were happy.",

We had quite a bit of a mix up with our vouchers but long story short, we had to use these tickets for breakfast instead of dinner:(  Anyways, I am definitely a breakfast girl because I love eggs, sausage, bacon, and pretty much anything you name!  This buffet was quite delicious.  There was a salad and omelette station as well that make your food right on the spot!  Everything was fresh too...unlike the other buffet I had the day before (circus circus buffet).  After eating many of the breakfast items, I had to get some sushi because I love it!!  I grabbed some smoked salmon and some different pieces of rolls.  As I sat down, there was a fly...like a gnat:(  gross.  I suddenly lost my appetite for sushi in all:(  The chef came out and apologized which i thought was very nice.  Our server was super helpful and adorable.  He told us there was free champagne as well so our table ended up making MIMOSAS!!!!  Towards the end, I was saddened because my belly could not consume any more food!!  I had to get DESSERT!! I grabbed some small desserts and COTTON CANDY!!  Yes! I felt like such a kid holding a big piece of pink cotton walking back to my table! I DONT CARE! it was good:) Overall, great place to eat!  NOTE: -no bathrooms, located outside -free champagne",

(<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA\">yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafo...</a>)   I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is.   The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.  When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees?   I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies.   I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",

It was 9am and I wanted to eat before I head on out to the airport. $15 a person wasn't so bad coming from a buffet that I thought it was average. Average price, average quality for TI buffet. I noticed how it looked nice and clean inside for an average buffet. Right when we were seated, our server served us our drinks and he was occupied somewhere else without checking up on us. There was fresh made omelette and side dishes on the side near by (french toast, pancakes, sausages, hash brown). The omelette was good, but not as much as I enjoyed at the Lago Buffet at Caesar's Palace. I remember the french toast was very plain in taste. The parfait was really good (plain yogurt at the based topped with cantaloupe and melon and granola bits). There was also a small sushi section, but I thought most sushi from buffets tastes similar to each other. There were also a pastry section with mini donuts! As I was getting full, I just had to get at least one mini donut. It was just so cute in its size, but perfect and good for me to end my meal! This is a place that I would consider average, but I disagree how others think it's so horrible when it's not that bad.",

    "text": "A little disappointed. I will admit that this is only the second buffet in Las Vegas that I have attended. The all-you-can-eat mantra doesn't really resonate with me because I will only eat obscene amounts if I love what I am eating. So if there are endless options of mediocre food, I feel I have waited my money. While I feel the value for this buffet is reasonable, I wasn't that impressed. There were lots of selections but they were pretty pedestrian. They had a cous cous salad that was so good however, I have since tried to recreate it twice at home! I did really enjoy their seafood section as they had crab legs and about 4 preparations of shrimp. I didn't make it to the pasta dishes, but I heard they were good as well. The desserts were many, and the creme brulee was actually very tasty. I also snagged a macaroon that I enjoyed. My honey definitely got his money's worth and ate enough for the both of us.",

This buffet used to be one of the best in Vegas but this time around (2011) it was the worst buffet my kids and I have ever had anywhere. We are in Vegas 3 imes a year and this was my daughter's favorite but now she does not care to ever go back.  It should have been a sign when we showed up and there were no lines because in the  past the lines were so long.  Definitely not worth the time or money",

    "text": "So my friends and I randomly came across this buffet at our hotel because we were starving and saw that they had prime rib and crab for 25 bucks... haha where can you go wrong with that?!! anyways, that's all I wanted was prime rib and mashed potatoes !! The sushi wasn't that great, my friends ended up just eating the top like the unagi and raw fish while putting aside that hard rice they use. I believe the macaronie did give me a stomach ache because it was a little too cheesy, the Chinese food was ok, a tad bit greasy. Yeah, I can't say much because I'm basically giving them 4 stars for the prime rib. Oh! The crab was better than I expected, it wasn't too salty unlike other buffets I have tried. They had a good selection of desserts like cotton candy, chocolate puff thingies, a variety of ice cream, crembule (not sure how to spell that), fruit chocolate tarts, and a lot more! I was getting too excited at the moment because I just wanted to indulge myself with chocolate and sweets. Although T.I. isn't well known as Bellagio's buffet, I came out actually being pretty satisfied and content with the food there.. but that's only because I went for their prime rib. I'm sure other resorts especially Bellagio has an awesome buffet as I recall they have a better selection of food.",

It is just absolutely amazing, you can pick your sauce(red, white, pesto), the type of pasta, and if you want shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, etc... The sushi is great, not the best, but its ok. They have made to order salads, and made to order soups. The salads are fully customizable, but the soups are more set and just picked, but it is made fresh, in front of you. The service is pretty good, but it really depends on who you get as your server. Now, for the best part, the dessert, just absolutely AMAZING. The eclairs are to die for. They have cottan candy, cookies, gelato, fresh fruit pastries, and other cakes. EVERYTHING is made in house. Not like those buffets where you can tell the dessert was bought and stuffed on a tray. Once again, I love the eclairs, and the coffee gelato. You will not regret coming here, I guarantee it. It is just amazing, one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. And the price is not even expensive, I think it's like 18 for lunch and 30 for dinner.",

The breakfast was weird - the eggs were soft like I like them but had a strange rice-like consistency, the sausages were also mushy inside, and the bacon was not crunchy but not limp either.  The sushi was just eh, not memorable - it tasted like it had been made earlier and refrigerated, because it was cold and kind of hard. The shrimp was peel-n-eat, which is a good way to keep lazy people from eating it. The fresh fruit (grapes, pineapples, strawberries) were good, and so was the stir fried veggies.  The corned beef was way dry, but the BBQ pork ribs were pretty damn good.  *sigh* what can I say? After eating at Wynn the night before, TI couldn't even compare. We just wanted something quick before going to the airport, so I guess this place worked in a pinch. But, if you had a choice and wanted to pay something in the same price bracket, I think the one at the Mirage was much better from my last visit to Vegas.",

Except that there was only one person working so there would be a long and pointless line up....  Sushi section: Way too much rice and the fish didn't look fresh. The little sides of bean sprouts and kimchi were good though.  Meats: Um, all were dry with no flavor...they put the BBQ sauce there to make it seem less dry and to overpower everything, but it's ultimately a horrible cover up for horrible food. Only meat that was passable was the veal. Very soft and yum.  Seafood (cold): Crab legs were salty and you have to peel the shrimp yourself.   Seafood (warm): Fish was not good at all. Dry, fishy...just bleh! Clam chowder on a plate? Not that great...fried clams were break-your-teeth hard. Rolled flounder was really weird tasting as well. I don't recommend the seafood at all.   Desserts: Everything looked really plain. Cheesecake was \"meh.\" Not much flavor or creaminess...and I love cheesecake :( Some strawberry pudding shortcake thing was not bad...fruit tart was extremely horrible. All the tarts were burnt so I just ate the fruit with some gelatin that was more hard than \"fluffy-pudding\" and slid right off the burnt pre-made tart. Ugh. Disgusting. Don't waste your time on this...  In fact, don't waste your time on this buffet, period! You could get something way better anywhere (with the exception of possibly circus circus). Just suck it up and spend maybe $5-$10 dollars more for Wynn or Aria buffet!",

    "text": "Everyone and their mother (literally, their mother) was in line waiting to get into the buffet.  Was it 2-for-1 coupons or free buffet vouchers that everyone had that made it so packed and such a long wait?  Oh wait, it was the free vouchers.  We had them.  T.I. had a special where the rooms were dirt cheap these particular couple of weeks in between Thanksgiving and Christmas and each night's stay you get two free buffet vouchers (good Mon - Fri only) for either lunch or dinner.  Arrived at 5:30 pm and it took around 75 mins to get in and seated.  First and foremost, 5 stars for our server Rod.  Great guy!  Friendly personality and very prompt and attentive service.  And with a smile, too.  Don't know how much truth there is into this, but it seemed like he enjoyed his job.    The lines at the buffet were, again long, just like outside.  They were divided into sections of BBQ, pastas, salads, something that past for Asian, and International, which was Mexican - what gives with that?  Not going to even go there.  Rude people and I had two old ladies cut in front of me twice.  The first time, I politely told one lady I was already in line before her; she apologized.  The second time, a Asian lady.  I let it go since I had a feeling she was going to give me the stink eye if I'd said something to her ~_O  I normally don't go out and hit the buffets or AYCE, but when I do, I prep and set a rhythm to not gorge myself, but just eat at an even pace.  If someone's gonna let me go to town, then I'm taking a trailer with me!  Knowing that we were still going out afterwards, I went easy and had a couple of dinner plates, salad and dessert.  Overall, food was very ehhh.  Dry and bland for the meats, Chinese chicken salad was drenched and drowned, fruit wasn't fresh and the desserts were bland and not sweet at all given what I had selected.  Hey, it was free and part of the room package promotion so we weren't going to pass that up.  But definitely, I wouldn't pay good, hard earned money to stand in a long line and eat blahh food.",

Too bad they don't make it anymore - huge disappointment. :( Took away all reason to come for dinner.  For breakfast, the chef makes several omelets at once and they're really good. There's an option to have it made of egg whites too, which I hear is healthier. You can also ask for sunny-side up. I usually like scrambled eggs, but the last time I came here, the scrambled eggs didn't even look like eggs and there wasn't much to rave about it. The mango smoothie near the salad is fresh and tasty. The muffins and donuts are really tiny - bite size - for breakfast, but when they switch over for lunch, the muffins are much bigger! Speaking of lunch, the beef tendon with noodles is good!  This place used to be a 4 with its famous dessert, but now that it's gone, it's more of a 3 or 3.5.",

At first i was excited that i got the vouchers and didn't have to spend money for food, which got me excited since that meant more money for drinks! Anyways my excitement was soon gone as i saw the spread for the lunch buffet. I tried several things off the lunch menu and none stood out. I can't complain and say this was the worst food ever but i have a hard time saying it was even mediocre. Dinner buffet was a tad better or maybe i was just a tad more drunk in not sure. The prime rib was a little too well done the lobster raviolli had some sort of crunch that i didn't understand i dunno if it was shell in the filling or what i never could find out.       All in all mediocre i never would have returned the second time if it were not for the voucher.",

They have a better food selection than they do dessert. My husband and l went for brunch, l thought the pancakes, sausage, bacon and eggs were good. They also had these potato thingies that were really yummy.  With that being said my husband was not so impressed with the food because he found a hair in one of the dishes he got. He could no longer eat after that. My husband thought the food was just ok, not too happy with the quality of the food (regardless of the hair incident) The service was ok, nothing great but nothing to complain about either. I don't know of l would go back but l am glad l tried it.",

    "text": "The best way to describe this buffet is average, not awful but it doesn't really stand out either.  They have a sushi station, an Asian station, a salad/fruit station, a pasta/pizza station, a burgers/dogs station, and a dessert station.   I had the lo mein and eggrolls which were okay and about what you'd expect. The BBQ ribs were surprisingly good and were the main thing I ate. They weren't too fatty or tough. The pulled pork was also pretty good and had a tangy mustard style sauce with it. The salad/fruit station was the usual, but had a German potato salad with no mayo which is good for those of us who hate mayo. The burgers at the burger station looked to be the cheap frozen patties and were sitting in some sort of sauce or something so I passed on those.   The dessert station was impressive and had apple caramel cup cakes, fresh made mini-donuts, mini peach and cherry pies, and cheesecake among other things.  Overall, this isn't the best buffet in Vegas but it isn't terrible either. It's not the Bellagio and it's nothing to write home about but it's not a bad option if you are in the area want a decent lunch (especially with the Tix 4 Tonight  or other discount passes).",

I pretty much loss my appetite and didn't enjoy my dinner.   Customer service was a mix.  Suzanne H. was very nice, courteous with great customer service.  But Gloria, the hostess that seated us was very rude.  Another negative is there is no restroom inside the restaurant.",

We love vegas buffets but if you're looking for taste, selection, and people that will clear the tables so you can continue to eat, this isn't the place. Don't pay the $32.95 per person.Sadly after years of making this our go to buffet when my kids have tournaments out here for softball. No more. I'm done.",

    "text": "This buffet was a disappointment.  Their weekend seafood dinner prices are $31.95 per person, as of October of 2015.  Since we were staying at Treasure Island, part of their resort fees includes a 2 for 1 voucher at their buffet, so we decided to try out their buffet.   We stopped by here around 6:30pm and there was a very long line.  Since we had a late lunch, we figured we'll come back here about 9pm, giving us an hour before they closed.  I assumed that the reason the buffet wasn't that good was that we came here at an unpopular time, which was a Sunday night with less than an hour before they closed.  The problems I had was that when we got here at 9:15pm, there was still a long line to get into the buffet.  Looking inside, there was a lot of empty available tables. Most of them were cleaned off too. The line went fairly quickly, but by the time they seated us, it was already after 9:30pm.  They did tell us that they closed at 10pm and the food will be removed by then. After we were seated, the hostess sat us at a very tiny table. There were a lot of other larger cleaned off empty tables. When we asked the hostess if we could just sit at another table.., she told us that we would have to stand in a corner and wait for another table. We had less than 30 minutes before they take the food away, so we decided to just sit at the tiny table.  When we were getting the food, you can tell that a lot of the food have been sitting out for quite a while. The prime rib were dry, the avocado were darkened, etc. They also weren't clearing the tables as frequently as it got closer to 10pm. Afterwards.., when it was 10:30pm, they told us the time and that we had to leave now. So by the time we sat down, we had less than 1 hour to eat. If we paid full price, this place would be a 1-star review.  I would image that if we came here early in the evening, the food would be better and so would their service; although I would never pay full price for this buffet. I would give this place another try with a 2 for 1 voucher, but I would come here at a better time.",

They have their own station and you tell the chef exactly how you want your items cooked and what you would like in them.  For the omelet they also offer just egg whites if you prefer.  It is not manditory but it is customary  to leave a $1 tip for the chef.  They also offer a made to order salad here which is delicious.  I have found it difficult to find salad at some of the other buffets so I appreciate that they have one here.  They also offer brick oven pizza, soups, meats, sushi, chinese food and a variety of other options.  The dessert section is delightful with fresh baked cookies, mini donuts, cakes, mouse, chocolate covered strawberries, ice cream and cotten candy.  Also everytime I go the same employees are there which means they must be happy.",

The beverages and food are both self serve. They have a wide variety of various ice coffees to soft drinks located in the middle of the restaurant. The food was divided up into several sections: seafood/Asian, Southern, Mediterranean, Italian, and an American see food mix kind of section. The desert table was located at the front left of the restaurant. It was a fairly decent selection ranging from ice cream to creme brulee.   Take aways: this buffets cheaper than the other ones that I found that are located on The Strip. It is also open till 10 o'clock which is really nice since a lot of other buffets close at eight or 9 o'clock. If you like crab legs you can eat your weight in crab there are also some really good things that are on the menu for people who don't like seafood. I personally would come to this buffet again.",

    "text": "Staying at TI meant that this buffet was the most easily-accessible buffet on the Strip. It didn't hurt that at check-in, we discovered that 2 free buffet passes came with our reservation. Yay! The catch was that those passes could only be used M-F, but it was all good; we went on the Friday night of our check-in. And then went back for brunch with champagne the next day.  Dinner: Since we got two free buffets, we paid for 2 more and split the cost between the 4 of us that went, and it was only $32 each, which really wasn't bad. The dinner buffet was open until 10 pm. And around 9 pm, they were still serving fresh, hot food. I tried the crab legs, pesto pizza, a little fried rice, and egg rolls. Everything was fine, not AMAZING, but not terrible either. Other choices included a BBQ station (easily the most crowded station), a made-to-order pasta station, salads, and sushi. And then of course we hit the dessert buffet, where the choices ranged from cute little donuts to creme brulee to fruit tarts to cotton candy. As the picture will show, we tried a lot of them. Everything tasted pretty good to me. I didn't try any of the eel, but my friend got a whole plate and it definitely looked good; she said it was delicious. It's not difficult to get your money's worth if you're okay with trying a little of everything.   Brunch: Brunch was $27 and it came with bottomless champagne. Not a bad deal, considering the large variety of choices. At around 11, the Chinese food, salads, sushi, and pizza were still there, with the addition of breakfast tarts/pizzas, omelette station, crepes & blintzes, mini waffles, mini pancakes, and staples such as scrambled eggs (which looked a little runny for me..) and hash browns. What was especially exciting was that they had mango lassi (delicious) and vegetable samosas (meh, but A for effort). I had the somewhat strange but definitely delicious combo of mini waffle, blueberry crepes, bacon and macaroni & cheese (don't judge me). The desserts, while still attractive, looked pretty much exactly like the night before, and I can see why other Yelpers think they just put out leftovers. Who knows. When I went back at around noon to see if I wanted anything else to eat, they had swapped out the breakfast-y stuff for more BBQ. Cornbread and biscuits instead of mini-waffles - no complaints about that here, but I can see how a late starter might still want breakfast at their noon brunch.   The service at brunch was fantastic. Someone give Teresa a raise. She was excellent about bringing over coffee AND champagne for us right away, and was never stingy with her pours. We had full glasses at all times. And they weren't little flutes, I'm talking like 10 oz glasses. She was very sweet.   Overall, I wouldn't hate coming back here, I just definitely have been to Vegas buffets with better quality food and more choices. Judging on dinner alone, A-OK. But brunch was 5-star-worthy. So the TI buffet gets a sunny Yay! from me.",

Service is ah-okay. I feel bad for the tourists that come here and pays $30 to eat here. It's not really worth it.   Even though the food was kinda dry, the best dishes they had were the Indian food. Tikka masala, spicy lentil and chicken masala were the best (but no as good as other places).   I also tried the Singapore noodles, kalbi, orange chicken, vegetable roll, chicken fried steak, baked chicken, potato salad, sushi and pizza -- all were very much disappointing.

The line to redeem the voucher was VERY VERY VERY LONG!  MANY customers were complaining and saying things like,  \"If we were at the Bellagio,  we wouldn't have to wait like this\"; & \"They have only 2 clerks and they look like they are college students\"!  I was worried that I wouldn't have time to eat before the 9:30pm Mystere show,  but the polite, calm young man assured me that the buffet closed at 10pm.   Down the hallway was the \"short\" buffet line.  I peeked inside and saw quite a few empty tables. ..okay. ..  As soon as I got my table,  I scouted out the food: BBQ station,  Pasta Station,  Baked Potato Station;  Asian Section; Salad Station; Dessert section & a bar!  Due to limited time, I had to skip the pasta and potato. I had a rib...it was ok. I had the pepperoni pizza, Unagi & maki sushi - good!  The made to order Cobb Salad was great!  The dessert (creme brulee,  chocolate covered strawberries,  soft coconut macaroons,  & fresh mini donuts) was fantastic! I saw the fryer for the donuts so I knew they'd be yummy!   If I had a bigger tummy and more time, I would get the red velvet cupcakes, the peel & eat shrimp,  the made to order pasta, the won ton soup, pho, fresh fruit and cheese. Guess I will have to return!",

Now we did have free buffet tickets to go along with the Cirque du Soleil Mystere show we received from our timeshare company....but I was pleasantly surprised at the options the Buffet had. Now as you all know by now I am VEGAN so I thought their wouldn't be much we could have anyway so I was prepared to be disappointed. However that was not the case....the VEGAN options.....even though they were not labeled as VEGAN were plentiful to tell you the truth. I had Vegetable Spring Rolls.....Fried Rice.....and Chocolate (DARK because it is VEGAN) covered Strawberries. Those were not the only options though.....they had a \"make you own\" salad and protein bar.....an awesome Indian food bar.....hummus.....pita and naan bread....wheat pasta.....and noodles. They also had some awesome soda fountains to make your own unique soda drinks.....liquor of course....tea.....coffee.....and various other NON VEGAN desserts.  Now while I would never pay 30 bucks for ANY buffet much less this one.....if your in a pinch or luck up on meal deal here.....it could be worth a look at least.

As another reviewer mentioned, I am also surprised at how low the reviews are for this place. While it is smaller than other buffets, and therefore offers fewer options, the selection of food and dessert is solid. I really do like the food here. This last time in particular, the service stood out for me. It was the friendliest and most attentive service I have received at any other buffet. I also loved the bottomless champagne offered with the brunch; you can order mimosas, or just order the champagne and mix your own juices (you get the non-alcoholic drinks on your own). I also loved this last time that aside from the special-order egg/omelet station, they also had a protein station, where you can create your own bowl, or have them give you one with the pre-determined ingredients. I cannot remember all of the options for the protein bowls, but here is a list of those I do: salmon, chicken, quinoa, beans, edamame, spinach, boiled egg, lettuce, field greens, etc. My boyfriend, who joined me for brunch, fell in love with the mango lasi and the bread pudding; this is saying a lot because he's Indian and has high standards for lasi drinks, and he's not a big fan of bread pudding.",

I understand that buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I would think that the casinos would up their game to draw diners into their buffets.  But it would appear that the opposite is happening.  I don't know if it's a numbers game, with the sheer volume of visitors guaranteeing these buffets patronage out of convenience.  Or if, the quality of buffet food is what it is, so they just roll with it.   My hopes are still up for the next one later this week.  As for Treasure Island's \"seafood buffet\"...uh what?  What seafood?  Crab legs, cold & pre-split.  Vegas, STOP DOING THAT!  Leave the crab legs whole!  Shrimp, cold and deveined, and void of flavor.  As for the rest of the seafood selections...a couple of fish options (both dry) and a sushi station, which was a joke.  The rest of the buffet was very pedestrian, with typical choices.  Prime rib, pre-sliced (why?!!!!) was salty and lacking any richness.  Korean short ribs, were not even close.  Various starches of mediocrity to help fill the void.  The self serve drink station would have been the highlight of the buffet, had the ice tea not tasted like it was brewed in sink water.  1 star, only because I paid for this food, even though I'm kicking myself for it.  By the way, we went to Pink's later and got a hot dog...thank God.",

I sat for two hours waiting for mystery and wait staff never rushed me...which brings me to my only majorish beef...why recommend 18-20% tip on the receipt when servers don't even serve drinks to you.  Drinks are self serve.  Only thing my server did was pick up my dirty dishes between plates.  That's it.  Seems a little misleading...maybe to fool foreigners who don't understand tipping guidelines at buffets.  Otherwise I'd return if I was at ti again.",

She's use to the much smaller fare we use to pay at Circus Circus when we'd bring the kids there back in the '90s. Those days are long gone. Even Circus Circus buffet prices have risen (we ate there too), with less food offerings.   For the variety and quality of their food and delicious desserts, I was content.",

She continues to pick out the rotten leaves and uses the rest. No salad for us. The bbq was awful bar the mashed potatoes. The chines was cooked to rubber, the Pizza looked good, but tasted like cardboard. Not sure how they managed to make it so bad. Given this, I dared not try the sushi. The beverages where of course self serve. The chocolate ice cream was ok.  The staff was polite, but uninspired. Total waist of money.",

The only thing that was slightly decent was the dessert, but when you've already lost your appetite from trying to eat the main food, even those redeeming qualities are small in comparison.  Save your money and head over to a more reputable buffet in Vegas! If this was my first Vegas buffet experience, I would never want to try any of the others.",

We got 2 free vouchers for free Buffet, at The Buffet in Treasure Island--- Was a bit unwillingly to go because of the reviews on Yelp, But who was going to pass up a free buffet??  We got there around 11. Half of the Right was Lunch, The other half Breakfast. Behind, dessert.  The Lunch area, was awesome. There was a sushi bar, with all the condiments. Next to it, was Chinese dishes, I really liked their shrimp dumplings, And their Vegetable Spring Rolls were AWESOME. Deliciously crunchy (not soggy) and fresh.  They had a customization of Chow Mein and PHO, and other noodle dishes, Pretty cool!! Along that was a Meat Section//Turkey Area. **Some of the Buffets still offer Thanksgiving selections: Turkey, Yams, Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Corn Bread, etc.  They still had an omlette station, but they were cleaning up since we were there between Breakfast and Lunch.  They were replacing the omlette station for a Pasta Station! Pretty awesome.  So the breakfast they offered was sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, Potatoes, pancakes, french toast, crepes, some other stuff lol.  I noticed how CRISPY the bacon looked, and just thought: \"That's how you cook bacon\" It was so delicious and crispy, not like Wicked Spoon's chewy bacon. (Don't get bacon at Wicked Spoon or the Kalbi Short Ribs)  The dessert area was super cute! I loved it. Tiny desserts. Cotton Candy. Mini Donuts (They have their version of blue berry donuts, it's hella good, and also Beignets!!) They had a strawberry shortcake in a cup, Fancy Fudge, tiny fruit tarts, Dreyers Ice Cream. Different slices of Cakes.  I really liked the bacon LOL. Everything else was great, and they give you wet naps for later.",

    "text": "We ate lunch there twice during our stay ... both times were just so-so.  I've read some of the previous reviews, and don't know what \"variety\" some of you are referring to.  I am not a picky eater but could only find a few items to eat.  My husband and I also received the 2 for 1 offer for the buffet.  Yes, it was cheaper than going to some of the other buffets but I really don't think it was worth the savings.  They had no seafood whatsoever during the week (for lunch or dinner ... we went in late for lunch and hung out for dinner).  The best thing about the place was their fresh salad bar where they make the salad any way you like.  The desserts were awful ... minus the homeade powdered donuts which were excellent.  Would I come back again?  No way.  We went to the buffet in Harrah's and spent less than what we did at the buffet in TI (with a 2 for 1 coupon) and it was delicious.  If you wait around until it's lunch time they will serve prime rib, peel and eat shrimp, ham, etc.",

Well, your going to eat it, and in the end you're going to say, \"dam*, at least it was free.   Sorry everyone. Straight to the point - it all tastes the same or tastes bad.    Oh but you want examples? Mac and cheese - nope, tastes like a whole lot of nothing. Prime Rib? tough, fatty, and overall no good. crab legs? skinny, poor quality, sad sad crab legs.   Look, I wanted to like it. I sat down, got excited after looking at my endless opportunities, and left within 30 minutes with a disappointed look and an upset stomach.   My suggestion? head somewhere else. Sure it's all you can eat, but all you can eat garbage is still garbage.",

Best of all, there was no line! The only drawback was the Keno woman who lied about bringing back our keno cards, but the food is what counts so we will definitely return!",

First of all the food selection is pretty scarce hot many choices you get to have. Second the pricing for the buffet is ridiculous for the amount of selection they had and they dont have restrooms in the buffet. Its invonvenient to have to leave the buffet for the restrooms.

Full disclosure we used bogo for breakfast and two freebies for dinner (both provided as \"valued guests of TI\" err we showed up with good credit card).  They offer several choices on buffet, but breakfast look for eggs benedict, blueberry crepes (use blueberry sauce not syrup!!), cheese blintzes, apple foldovers, fresh prepared corned beef hash (DO NOT PASS THIS UP!), and the pastry bar.  Most of everything else is standard fare at best.  They offer a omelet bar, so you can get fresh made here.  The food was all fresh.  However, they change over at lunch looked pretty good and we decided to go back for dinner.  Good thing it was free!!!  Please don't pay full price for dinner.  The best of the dinner menu was pork ribs.  The prime rib was very bland, country,  fried steak was dried out, and most everything else was bland over overcooked.  Mac & cheese was good and may be high watermark for buffet for entrees (is that a sorry statement?!).  Again if you go, hit dessert hard.  Coconut macroons, chocolate cake, cheesecake (with sour cream frosting), red velvet cupcakes, eclairs,  and mini donuts are awesome, but not worth the price of admission alone.",

I'll keep it short; they are going for the \"upscale\" buffet experience but it just falls short.  The food is VERY hit and miss and a lot of the food doesn't seem fresh/freshly made.  They serve all-you-can-drink beer and wine for an additional cost, which may appeal to some but I didn't do it.  The service was slow and the floor supervisor started bawling out our waitress, who was trying really hard but was obviously overloaded with tables.  Overall, for the cost I would suggest that you go to a different restaurant and hopefully enjoy your experience a bit more than we did.",

NO CARVING STATION at all.  American section -  Chicken Fried Steak was so hard, we can't even saw it apart with the knife. BBQ pull port was so spicy, our family can't eat it. Trout has no taste - wasted a good fish. No Fried Chicken.  Asian and Japanes food sections were a joke - Brocoli beef  - beef was like leather Orange Chicken - Chicken is like leftover, dried, hard and doughy Sushi  - my son's said his college Sushi was better.  Mexican section -  Foods look so bad (dried), none of my family even try.  Italian section -  Lobster Ravioli - had a bite of my wife's three Ravioli, the sauce was decent, but where is the lobster.  Salad and dessert were the only good sections which the reason why I gave it a one star.  Our server didn't even come to our table until we were half way finish our first plate to asked us for take order for drinks.  Empty soda glasses and never got re-fill.  We have to ask her to serve coffee after almost done with our dessert.

We didn't realize it wasn't the $21 advertised until we had already been rung up, but apparently the extra cost included the addition of a lot of seafood like crab legs which my fiancee wanted.  As far as meat, other than some good prime rib, there really wasn't much of anything. Almost no chicken, other beef, pork, etc. All and all, I think I ate almost exclusively side dishes (which were all very good), but all sort of made me feel like it wasn't worth the $26 entrance fee.  The desserts were very good, but nothing special. Ice cream, chocolate covered strawberries and other pastries were all solid, but nothing that really made me go \"wow.\" On the plus side, the service was really good, and the waitress and other staff very helpful.  I can't recommend this for the high price unless you're really into crab legs, but it may be a good value at lunch.",

    "text": "Still not bad, the breakfast bar lacked this time, dinner was great.  Went 2x while there, group of 9 the first night and 8 for breakfast, they tried to bust our balls and add 18% grat on a buffett when all they do is bring us one drink???  Be real, at 24$ a person you are not going to get 18% on a group.  Then we say fine seat us at two tables right next to eachother, they did which was cool but did it with a wall in between us.    Strawberry short cake was sweet!!!!  Cotton candy sucks, but fun to play with.  Pizza is good, ribs are good, chinese was also good, but it's time to update it a little folks.  D",

    "text": "I think 3 stars is a fair rating if you're someone who really takes pleasure in conquering the extravagant buffets in Las Vegas. But I'm not really too fussy or curious about trying out the various buffets in Vegas. Generally speaking, as long as there's meat, I'm happy. Oh.. and of course.. I love me some good eatin' competitions with my friends.    I've given the buffet at treasure island a solid 4 stars because it's a good $15.00 cheaper than other buffets on the strip, there was no line, and the selections were comparable to other buffets. While the food itself was very average by buffet standards, their DESSERTS were EXCELLENT. Seriously, the small corner reserved for the desserts may look meager in size and selection but they tasted AMAZING even after 3 plates of meat and etc.   In sum, I wouldn't disagree with the other reviewers who'd given the Treasure Island buffet 3 stars, but personally, the meal(s) did the job, and the desserts were a delightful find to supplement a great trip to Vegas.",

The one thing I liked was the pasta bar, it looked a little messy but it was very tasty. The pasta portion was big and I felt bad but I only ate 1/2 since I wanted to try other things.",

    "text": "How in the world can you mess up spare ribs? Or chicken? Or the rice in sushi? Come on Treasure Island! What the heck? I've been to many, many buffets in Vegas and hands down, this is the worst I've ever been to. Granted, I went during lunch time so I can't comment on quality or value during dinner, but this was absolutely horrible.  The good: (Total 3 stars) Desserts were actually pretty good. Red velvet cupcake, pineapple upside down miniature cake, very good cookies, real Dreyers Grand ice cream. And, oh, they didn't mess up the ice tea. The mashed sweet potato was very good.   The bad: (Total -2 stars) Wow...where do I begin. Okay, I rarely ever eat sushi at these buffets but since they had no shrimp or crab or mussels or any other seafood during lunch time despite a $20.95 price tag, but I was desperate for anything somewhat fishy. How do I describe the rice? Let me see...a cross between spoiled pudding, 5 day old rice, and concrete grounds. I actually just took the small pieces of fish and shrimp on this sad excuse of sushi rice, ate the fish and used the rice to build a pyramid on my plate. Yes, I've eaten at AYCE sushi buffets so I don't equate them to sushi restaurants, but my goodness this was horrid. Pork ribs? Well, they display real oak wood behind the serving counter at the bbq area, but it's not oak-fired ribs. It was artificial smoke flavor...and it was putrid. Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost. Treasure Island, please wake up, and guests STAY AWAY from this buffet. First time I've stayed at this hotel, and the rooms were actually pretty good, but the buffet actually ruined the experience.",

    "text": "Very impressive Champagne Brunch Buffet. You can get a discount if you buy your reservation from Tix for Tonight in advance. The buffet itself is identical to the Bellagio brunch buffet but about ten bucks cheaper. The service is decent. The mimosas could arrive a little quicker. Try the dessert table....it's ridiculous. Pie, freshly baked donuts and chocolate covered strawberries. Yum. If you're in Vegas, there's no better bang for your buck champagne brunch.",

Dessert was lots of variety. $23 or so but we was in a group so got hit with gratuity and tax. Came to about $30. One plate for $30. Sounds good haha",
