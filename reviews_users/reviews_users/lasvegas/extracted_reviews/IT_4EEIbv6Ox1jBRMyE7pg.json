Everything was perfect.  The service, the food,the drinks, the restaurant itself... impeccable!  We weren't going to get appetizers but the waiter talked us into getting a sampler type special they had going on and it was so worth it!  The crab cake isn't like ur average crab cake... it's boiled chunks of crab in a lobster remoulade sauce... and we had shrimp cocktail with 3 different sauces... so good... we both had steaks, i had the filet and he had the ribeye... both were cooked to perfection and we had creamed corn and potatoes au gratin for sides... everything was SO perfect... we were too full for dessert.  I also had the VIP martini which was a 10 day old Vodka Infused Pineapple... soooo good!!",

I would still rank this slightly below Flemings because the fatty portions didn't melt in my mouth as quickly and the appetizers weren't as appetizing. The service was top notch, I never had my glass of water less than 3/4 full, and the ambiance was nice. The west coast oysters were a little on the small side but still fresh. If you're in Vegas, and you're feenin for some steak, Del Frisco's is the spot to go. HIP HOOPPPP!!!",

The waiter even asks you to cut down the middle of the steak to see if it is cooked correctly. I kinda brushed him off thinking it was all talk, but he waited patiently for me to slice it. These guys are serious. Even though they warned me that the plate was hot, i forgot and paid dearly for that mistake. The sides of broccoli and mushrooms were wonderful. Overall, the place is expensive, but customer service and food were outstanding.",

Have been here on multiple occasions and the food is always cooked to perfection and they are always more than willing to recook your steak if it is not cooked to your liking.  They have some of the tastiest steaks West of Texas!  All prime and they even have kobe available on occasion.  Great crabcakes and salads - love the wedge with green goddess dressing.  Even the regular salad is great - came with two whole slices of bacon the last time I ordered it.  Great wine selection as well.  They even gave us a tour of the wine cellar and played the James Bond table for us - very cool.  Decor is very old school - they even have a cigar room!  Service is always great - Great experience overall.",

We have always loved the attentive service, good food, and the cigar lounge in the back (well my father and brother really loved this, my mother and I remained neutral).  Flash forward to this weekend, and the family has had another good dinner, yet has also left a bit dissapointed.  The food remains top-notch, and for that we are thankful.  The pleasantness of servers also gets high-marks, however, this is where the praising ends.  There were small errors on the wait staff including handing a steak knife to me with the blade facing me.  Unfortunately they are now using cheaper wine glasses and silverware on the tables.  We were seated right next to the bar, which got pretty loud as the night drew on.  And, due to the no smoking ban in Nevada now, there is no more cigar room in the back.  Totally not the restaurant's fault, just a bit dissapointing.  To me, the little things in a fine dining establishment matter.  If I am paying $50 for a steak, not only should service and food be impeccable, but so to should the atmosphere.  This restaurant is still good, however, with all the other well known steak restaurants in the city that fall into the same price range, it may be time that the family move on and try another restaurant.",

    "text": "If I could give it another star I would.  It was that good.  The overall experience was, I dare say, even better than Luger's in Brooklyn.  First of all, the service in this restaurant is impeccable.  The minute you walk in the door, from the hostess to the server to the bus boy, they are attentive and professional.  Your water glass and bread basket will never be empty.  Further, and more importantly, the steak here is awesome.  We opted for two specials-- the bone-in filet and filet with blueberry reduction.  Although both were really tender, cooked exactly as we ordered them, the filet with blueberry was particularly delicious.  I mean it literally melted in your mouth.  For the starter we had the crab cakes which were good.  They were broiled not fried, consisting of lump crab meat in a rich and creamy sauce.  For sides, we ordered the onion rings and sauteed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were actually really good, very juicy and firm, pretty buttery though.  Don't be fooled by the innocuous sounding onion rings because this thing is huge.  It comes out as 10 big onion rings stacked high on top of eachother.  Our server advised that they tasted the best late night so we packed these inevitable leftovers into our doggie bag.   To complement our meal, we also ordered two glasses of white and a bottle of red wine (recommended by our server).  Our server was knowledgeable about wines yet not stuffy at all.  This place is a definite must dining spot for steak lovers passing through the Vegas area.  Yes it is on the pricier side, but it is worth it.  We will be stopping by this oasis on all our future trips out to the desert!",

When I called to check in with my boyfriend, he had mentioned that he had gotten a thank you card from Del Frisco's after going there during SEMA and highly suggested that we try it.    I ordered the house salad, filet and shrimp, and the creamed spinach.  The salad came with two pieces of crispy bacon on top, the vinaigrette that it was tossed in was okay, I think  i would get it with the house ranch dressing next time.  The steak and shrimp were amazing.  The filet was the most tender  piece of steak I've ever had.  I tried the Chateau potatoes that my friend got and they were amazing.  The creamed spinach was like no other, with chopped pieces of bacon.  Good thing I don't eat like this every day.  a week later I got a thank you note too.  guess I need to go back soon.",

I ordered the bone in rib eye it was so flavorful, we basically ordered one of each dish to try to get a good feel, the only thing to be a miss from everybody was the Mac & Cheese i read that alot of people did not like this side dish but we had to try it for ourselves since they said it was a specialty. All the other side dishes were good! They served us a creme brulie & lemon cake it was really good and we made it into a birthday cake for the birthday girl! The service was awesome they brought all the main courses out at the same time, everything from the drinks to the bread was very good! This place has large rooms and a very nice bar area for very large party's even wedding parties, i cannot wait to go again real soon!",

    "text": "Del Frisco's what a great place to eat. My Wife and I went on a trip to Vegas in January. So we made reservations to eat at Del Frisco's while we were there. Because a friend of ours told us it was a must to eat at Del Frisco's when you are in Vegas. Our big night was Tuesday Jan. 26, 2010. It was fabulous, what a great meal. For starters we had a salad with the house dressing that was to die for. I ask our waitress Liz, if they sold it? The answer was no. To bad, I would have bought a case! So after the salad we shared a bone in filet mignon ( mouth watering ) and a lobster tail with an order of the chateau potatoes. Every thing was superb. We were treated great from the minute we walked in the front door. Out waitress Liz  was wonderful and all the other staff members. After our meal Liz treated us to a viewing of the James Bond Wine table. That was pretty cool. Then a few days after returning home from our vacation we received a Thank you card from Liz. That is a very nice ending to a great vacation and a wonderful meal. So the next time you visit Vegas I would highly recommend that you eat at Del Frisco's .",

Yes, the seasoning tends to the strong side, but it definitely adds a unique flavor that most steaks lack. The sides are phenomenal as well. We ate there for the big meal during my bachelor party, and the staff was very accomodating. I guess the only downside is the off-Strip location. Spring for the taxi ride, though, because it's well worth it.",

This place has become my favorite steakhouse now.  We decided to go on a Tuesday night and they were jam packed so I had a drink at their bar as they tried to squeeze us in. We started with their crabcake with cajun lobster sauce appetizer which was delicious. I then ordered the filet mignon while my boyfriend ordered the ribeye with an australian lobster tail.  The filet was very good but the ribye and the lobster tail were out of this world. We also ordered the creamed corn and chateau potatoes as sides.  Both were good.  The whole dinner was great.  I also enjoyed a couple of their signature pineapple infused martinis.  We found the service to be quite attentive and above par.  After our dinner, they gladly called a cab for us back to the strip and after we arrived home from our vacation, there was a thank you card in our mailbox from them!  This place definitely rivals much more expensive steakhouses on the strip.",

    "text": "I was in Las Vegas this week with my family. The four of us went to Del Frisco's on a Monday at around 10pm. Had reservations initially at 6pm, but had to change due to late lunch and no one was that hungry. When we got there, restaurant was pretty empty, just us and two other parties. We first saw the James Bond wine table, pretty neat. The table opens up to James Bond theme music and there are number of wines with various James Bond movies etched on the bottles. It was obviously for display only and not intended to be consumed. Anyway, was pretty cool. We were obviously seated immediately since the restaurant was empty (reflects the overall Vegas economy and time of year). We had the following: Crab cakes- delicious, full of fresh crab meat and very little filler. Sauce was very good but bit salty for SF Bay area tastes.  Strip steak- cooked just as asked. Very tender, good flavor. Filet mignon- again, cooked as asked. Full of flavor. Lamb- again, very good, lots of flavor. Only problem was trying to get each bit of meat off the bone without picking it up and chewing on it. Since not many people around, picked it up and started chewing. Pasta with scampi- excellent dish. Just the right amount of butter and garlic. Scampi were very tender. Asparagus- good side, but not that different from other restaurants. Bread- warm, just baked, really good with butter. Do as they suggest, tear it open, don't use a knife.  Lemon cake- we debated if we wanted dessert since we were all pretty full. We decided to shared one very large piece of lemon cake. It was delicious, full of lemon flavor and moist. Those who initially did not want dessert actually wanted more once they tried a small piece. The service was excellent. They were there when you needed them and were not overlly intrusive. However, considering that the restaurant was empty, I would hope that service would be excellent. The prices were high, but no more than other steakhouses in Las Vegas. We had been to Craftsteak this time last year. If I were to compare the two, I would say that the entrees and appetizers were better at Del Frisco's, the sides dishes better at Craftsteak, dessert equal in both places, and the service better at Del Frisco's (however, not fair comparison since Craftsteak was fairly busy when we were there last year). Finally, I think that Del Frisco's was cheaper for what you got. The final conclusion from our family is- Del Frisco's is the default steakhouse for us in Las Vegas. One last point, we are from the SF Bay area. We found the food in Las Vegas (at all the restaurants) to be very salty compared to comparable restaurants in the SF. May want to consider asking them to cut back on the salt if you are use to lower amount of salt in your food. We went to Nob Hill at the MGM the next day. We specifically asked them to cut the salt and they did.",

I've heard great things about this restaurant for years and was excited to try it. Everything was beautiful, but every dish we ordered was just average. The potatoes were creamy but too rich to eat, and my salmon (or the sauce on the salmon) had obviously gone bad. It tasted moldy! Everyone in my party who ordered the salmon experienced this. The vegetables were steamed simply, which I'm fine with, but as I was unable to eat anything else on my plate they weren't enough to write home about. The bread pudding was too sweet to eat, and had an unpleasant consistency. I was with a large group and we all ordered the bread pudding, but no one was able to eat it! An incredibly expensive meal for low quality food. Skip the menu, have a drink at the beautiful bar.",

Five of us were in Vegas to celebrate hubby's 40th birthday and he chose this place based on Yelp reviews.  He did good!!  I made reservations and noted that it was his birthday, half-hoping they'd do something to acknowledge it.  Imagine our surprise when the hostesses greeted him with a chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" as we walked in.  Upon being seated, our server walked over and placed a card that had already been waiting on the table in front of hubby.  It was a birthday card signed by the staff!  Our server shook hubby's hand and also wished him a birthday.  Not to belabor the point but a couple more people stopped by to wish him a happy birthday.  Now the food.  Probably the best steaks I've ever had.  Seasoned perfectly throughout and cooked perfectly as well.  Although I went with the smaller ribeye cut, I ended up eating only half of my steak....because I became distracted by the sides and the appetizers!!  To start, we had fried oysters (excellent, large and fresh - not overcooked), tuna tartare (old school preparation and very good) and a dozen oysters from each coast (fresh, briny and sweet though that's probably just because they were good oysters).  Sides were the lobster mac and cheese (perfect level of richness where you don't feel all icky after eating some), asparagus (okay, just steamed and topped with almonds) and creamed spinach (amazing!).  Gf ordered a plated dish (with sides) and her chateau potatoes were spicy and delicious (I'm going to get a side of it next time).  Hubby ordered a baked potato for himself to go with his porterhouse and while he felt guilty eating it, he loved that they put melted butter into the open potato and then scooped more whipped butter on top, alongside the sour cream.  We'd brought a cake and they were very gracious in serving it up for us.  We gave them the remaining half in gratitude for their service.  There were no foams, gelee's, dry ice, constant utensil changes or pyrotechnics in our meal...none was needed when they shocked and awed us with their wonderful service and impeccable steaks.",

    "text": "One of the BEST Steakhouse Experiences Ever!  Several years ago, I had dined at Del Frisco and thought the food was mediocre and the steaks were overly seasoned. However, one of my friends had recently seen Del Frisco featured on a TV show and wanted to eat here for her birthday. Let's just say, the second time around was definitely a charm. This time, the food and service was outstanding which earns Del Frisco's 5 STARS!  On Saturday, 9.10.11, my friends and I came for an early dinner at 5:30 pm. We were promptly seated with reservations.   F O O D *STEAK TARTARE ($16) - 4 STARS The steak tartare was tender and smooth with a nice savoryness to it. Paired long with the garlic crostini, it was the perfect blend of garlicky crunch with savory softness from the tartar.  *32 OZ. BONE-IN WAGYU RIBEYE ($90) - 4.5 STARS Perfectly seared to a medium rare with a warm pink center, the wagyu had a nice crust which sealed in all the juices. The first bite was sublime. Ribeye is already a fatty cut of meat and the increased marbling from the wagyu and the bone-in added an intense richness full of decadent beefy flavor. Each bite was sinfully good and a carniwhore's delight.  *SPINACH SUPREME w/ Bacon ($12) - 4 STARS Talk about kicking up creamed spinach a notch. Already rich and decadent, the bacon added a nice smoky flavor with an extra layer of savoryness.  *CHATEAU POTATOES ($10) - 3.5 STARS Like chunky mash potatoes, the chateau potatoes were smooth yet had a nice bite to it. I liked the addition of the cayenne pepper which gave it a nice kick.   *LOBSTER MAC 'N CHEESE ($16) - 3 STARS Though the macaroni was perfectly cooked to an al-dente, I felt the bechamel sauce was lacking that ooeey gooey cheesiness and no lobster was really detected.   S E R V I C E ABSOULTELY IMPECCABLE! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly and whisked away to our table. A card signed by the staff was brought to the birthday girl; what a nice touch! Our waitress Kelsey was AWESOME! She was very friendly, down-to-earth, knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive.  Food service was timed very well. As soon as we received our steaks, we were asked to cut into it to make sure it was cooked to our liking which it was. All the sides were served by the staff upon getting our entrees.   They even brought out a complimentary slice of their famous lemon cake for the birthday girl.  Though the food at Del Frisco is about 4 STARS, the service is everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, so I must reward them with an extra star.  A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Classic steakhouse feel with crisp white linens, dark wood furnishings, hardwood floors, and dim lighting. Del Frisco is the perfect place for a romantic date or a large party as they have several private dining areas.   The restroom reminded me of a restroom at a club complete with a bathroom attendant, mints, gum and various lotions.   San Francisco has no shortage of steakhouses but can rarely live up to the ones I've tried in Vegas. Del Frisco is unequivocally no exception.",

    "text": "I've heard this is the best steak house in town, and since I've never been, it seemed to be the place to try.   Reservations were easy via Opentable and I made it 15 minutes prior to arrival. Granted this was an earlier reservation at about 6pm, when I checked in to the hostess stand, they said they were ready for me. Nice.   There were a couple of servers who assisted with taking our order and they were both very friendly and informative. Before diving into the menu, wait for the specials of the day. They also have off menu items too.   We shared:   Del's salad which was a mixed green salad with tomatoes, and a couple of thick bacon strips. For $10, it was not worth it. I could have bought a pack of greens, box of tomatoes and a pack of bacon.   Seafood Soup: It was a light bisque with fish and shrimp. It was ok but it was only a cup for $11.   Bone in Prime Rib: Since this was a large hunk of meat at 22 oz, we split it and they split it in front of us. I had a bit of each side; filet and ribeye. Between the two, I liked the ribeye more, as usual. It was tasty and just enough fat.   Potatoes au Gratin: Usually this dish is with sliced potatoes but this dish was quartered red potatoes. What made this dish was the creamy buttery sauce with the baked cheese on top. Weird but this was my favorite dish... but maybe because I love carbs.   It's True, there is a weird sewer smell at the entrance. It's not appetizing walking in or out of the restaurant.",

We both ordered the filet mignon, sides were creamy spinach and potatoes au gratin and it was all amazingly good. My girl even loved the filet even though she's not much of a meat eater.  Drinks were VIP martini, I had about five or six of them they're so crazy good, and she had the pomegranate martini. Drinks, top shelf. Love it!  Only draw back our server at first seemed to want us to hurry and order even though we were trying to take our time and draw out our dinner as we were in no hurry. That made my girl a little uncomfortable. He backed off though and everything else was perfect! They even sent out a celebratory slice of seven layer lemon cake which was silky and delicious!

Good start, bad finish.   Next dish was the Del Frisco house salad. Good balance of toppings and delicious dressing - minus the fruit fly. How does an upscale steakhouse allow that to happen? I was pretty embarrassed for them. But I let the manager know and he replaced my salad and treated the table to the infamous VIP martini. Nice recovery. Onto the entree.    Order the ribeye. Perfect amount of marbling for extra fatty juicy goodness. Pretty good portion too - I couldn't finish my steak. Sides were forgettable. Green beans were fresh but greasy, as were the cheesy potatoes. For dessert I had their cheesecake topped with strawberry sauce. Again nothing unique, but something sweet to finish the meal is always a nice treat.   Probably wouldn't return again as there are plenty of other places in Vegas that are worth trying.",

    "text": "Thanks for American Express and their $50 gift card to this restaurant, we were able to venture out of our usual Vegas strip restaurant and try a new steakhouse.  So glad we found this place because it became our new favorite!   Everything from the food, appetizer, dessert, ambience, service, bathrooms, parking, etc was perfect.  We made a last minute reservation on a Sunday night at 5:30pm.    Our server Gustavo (I think that's how his name is spelled) gave us an impeccable service and we really enjoyed his sense of humor along with his charming personality throughout our meal.  It's not everyday you get a server who can provide a smooth flowing comfortable dining experience.   Thank you Gustavo!  We look forward to dining here again real soon.    For appetizer, you must order their raw oysters.  Between the East and West, we liked the West side oysters because they were smaller and sweeter.  This was a great start to our meal.    The prixe fix dinner was only $50 but came with a choice of salad, appetizer, choice of bigger cuts for extra $$ or the 8oz filet cut and one family size side dish.    My husband ordered the Tamaha Wagyu 32 oz cut for extra $50.  That steak looked like something Fred Flinstone would devour!   Only a True steak lover with a huge appetite can finish this steak in one seating!   I was skeptical about the 8 oz steak and thought it would be more dry and boring.  To my surprise even the filet was very juicy and flavorful!   The different side dishes were all perfect and big enough to share with the family.   Crab cakes and Scallops were all good portions to pair with our steaks.    They are known for the Lemon debosh cake.  No matter how full we were, there was no way we were going to leave without trying this cake.  It's big enough to share between 4 people.  Despite not being a huge lemon fan, this had to be the best lemon cake we've had and would order it again next time.  Not too tart or too sweet.  Perfectly moist and delicious.  Save room for this cake!  We love this place so much better than SW steak or CUT!   Glad to have found Del Frisco's!  Wish they had another location in LA!",

The price is better, and if you were to eat the same meal on the strip it would likely cost you double if not triple the price.  The boy and I shared the namesake steak, it was delicious. When the steak is brought to your table, the waiter will cut in the center for you to make sure it's cooked to the proper temperature.   Oh the CRAB CAKE! It is the best crab cake ever! Seriously! That sauce had so much umami flavor and the crab cake had little to no fillers. After eating the cake, I used my bread to slop up as much of what was left on the plate.   We also brought cupcakes for our friend's dinner to which the restaurant stored for us and didn't charge us a cake cutting fee. I thought that was amazing. A lot of restaurants try to nickle and dime you here and there. They also brought out two large slices of their own cake for our two friends.   I am definitely returning! Make reservations!!",

    "text": "I'm actually not sure how to begin this, so I'm just going to start at the beginning and let you decide...  Four of us choice this steakhouse because it was the only one in Vegas with 4.5 stars. The other high end spots had a max of 4. Personally I've always been a fan of Jean Georges at Aria but they were booked tonight so we had to pick a new spot and so I made the command decision to go with the highest rated. Biggest mistake I've ever made.  Things started off behind. We showed up ok time for our reservation at 800, only to stand in the lobby for another 10 minutes while they mustered up the enthusiasm to seat is at one of the empty tables. We order crab cake, king crab and salads to start. Crab cake was good. King crab okay. But then the real insanity began. The first came out scallops on a plate smothered with a thick sort of teriyaki soy blend paste that was so powerful, I recoiled upon taste. Unfortunately it wasn't strong enough to mask the flavor of the scallop which was clearly a few days old and or frozen (very thick, like a meat not a fresh scallop) if I you do choose the scallops, pair them within sauteed mushroom...why, because these canned caps will have the same dense flavorless texture and taste.  Then here comes the Double Eagle prime strip, which I asked for a thin line of Pink, but like my friend and her hubby all meats, Lamb, Filet and Strip were rare. The filet and strip were sent back with once again specific instructions to have them just a line of pink. ****to be fair, I never send back steak, why? Because inevitably the cook is gonna take it personally as if we're insulting their taste buds and my dinner is gonna come back burnt.  Before the plate hit the table I could tell it was over cooked. The plate was radiating heat around 800*Fahrenheit leaving nothing more than a lump of low grade dog food. (Which I'll talk about in a minute)  The manager asks what's wrong. And at this point I say, \"nothing\" because I'm no longer interested in playing this game. I just want to go but they insist to pick something else at it won't be charged. So I ask for a filet and a box to pick the dog food in so my puppy can at least benefit from my night out. The waiter tells me, \"don't worry about the box, we'll take care of that after its all done\"  What happens, my filet comes out and in the drop off, they steal back my dog food and leave me with the remains of the only meat that came out all night that was anything near a real piece of meat. But to be honest, now that I'm home, I would have rather brought the dog food home. At least I know he would enjoy it. Because none of what I ate feels good in my stomach. I feel genuinely robbed!!!  Mind you...we've been ready to leave for the last 10-15 min but we can't leave because no one stops by our table anymore to see how we're doing. Finally after going to find someone myself, they ambush is with a lemon dessert cake and the check.  ***thats right, the check, which still has the other two pieces of meat that were undercooked as well as the untouched mushrooms. $300 and when I look back and try and remember what I ate...I honestly can't remember. Couple bites of bland lettuce. Half a filet. A two bites too many of food and sauces so disgusting, you wouldn't serve it to a volunteer shelter with a good conscience.  Come to think of it, I would have rather, done a spa day, then watched the Mayweather fight again before stopping by chipotle. At least then my nails would be done.  I have NO idea how they achieved this rating, they must give away free meals to elite yelpers because I dare say if you just had 10 regular yelpers dine in and give ratings, your have 2-3 star tops and only because average customer feels bad for writing a negative review.  Ps-in the spirit of full disclosure, the manger did come out with the intention of making it right. Her intentions were good. So she gets a thanks. But the rest, is upsetting when think anymore about it.",

They also did not have a special desert for the holiday. I have had way better dates at other high end restaurants on the strip during this holiday.  $300 later and we were disappointed.",

    "text": "First and foremost, my favorite steakhouse...  Oh my G!  Del Frisco's holds a special space in my heart.  My first Del Frisco steak was in NYC, the first weekend I went low carb in 2007, still low carb strong in 2013, I gauge a restaurant by the steak. . So sad to leave NYC, but I was so happy to find Del Frisco's in Vegas...we are regulars...Coming here about every 3 months.    We always order a bottle or two of wine, a chopped salad and  a Tomahawk Ribeye Waygu steak ample enough for two-about 32 ozs (12 oz bone and 20 oz of meat).  While it costs $90 bucks...it can be a value if each individual steak is starting at $45. BTW, TDF...nothing like it...impressive to the eye, like a Flintstone steak, big, beefy, hot, and  juicy... what is not to like?  Service is always impeccable, but we've definitely had some characters, such as Amber that flat out denied our frequent customer card because we were going to split a $500+ bill with another couple, but the next time our waiter was AWESOME!  He hooked us up, taking care of all 6 of us, but  still (I am pretty sure) sticking to their \"make you feel like a million bucks\" policy.   I HIGHLY recommend a sommelier to navigate the expansive wine menu...they always have good recs.  Tell them your price point and a few flavors or characteristics you like in a wine and they will help you find a gem.  Really take advantage, some of the best soms in Vegas.   While i am female, I love the old school massive testosterone feel of this restaurant.  I even saw a group of men walking to the restaurant still about a mile away and I said to my husband that \"Yep, they are going to get some meat at Del Frisco's, before they start their night\"  About 20 minutes after we arrived by car, they sure enough were walking into Del Frisco's.  I always chuckle at the Thank You card I receive in the mail  a few days after I devour my Tomahawk steak.  Nice touch.  IDK, I just love old school masculine feel...but I sure feel and get treated like a lady yet still can eat and enjoy like a \"man\".",

Top notch service, great ambiance provided by the talented pianist, and best of all, the food.  I had the ribeye and it was PHENOMENAL. Juicy, delicious, and cooked to perfection. The Caesar salad was quite tasty, too. I went back a few weeks later and tried the Double Eagle, and that was also a winner.

It is a very chill yet classy setting inside. I like the fact it is off the strip so it isnt overly crowded and touristy but yet it is still busy.  Everyone was very friendly from the hostess, to the bartender to the server and the manager also touched down at our table after the meal.   We got the seafood/shell fish appetizer to start that had crab claws, crab legs, oysters and shrimp which was a bit expensive maybe for the size of the platter but overall great quality. They could have maybe threw an extra crab leg or claw on there.  We also split a wedge salad that was on point.   For the main course we both got the lump crab cakes in lobster sauce which were amazing. Some of the best crab cakes we have had in Vegas. Im sure the steaks are great too but we have been shying away from red meat as of late.    It is a very nice establishment and you should dress accoringly not your shorts, flip flops or tank top kind of place.   Overall a great experience and we will visit again sometime!",

This place has a perfect old-school leather and wood boardroom feel.  The menu is simple- steak, seafood and sides.  No trendy fusion fare with unicorn horn or rainbow dust.  This place simply serves the best meats with best ingredients and meticulous preparation.  The sides were basic but tasty and perfectly complimented the entre.    Yes, it's a franchise but it's a damn good one.  It's not cheap however the quality and service make it worthwhile.  The only problem is that it practically ruined me for other steak houses.    Simply great steak.  Correction: simply excellent steak.",

I got the Bone-In Ribeye, which was delicious. It had a good amount of fat to balance out the medium-rare lean meat.  He had the signature \"Double Eagle\" steak and boy was that bad. It was like my ribeye but with all of the life sucked out of it, then repackaged for more money.  It was too thick, hard to cut, and too lean.  The two of us ended up finishing the ribeye and we took the majority of the very pricey Double Eagle steak back.  I guess we were planning a late-night snack but when we saw the box in the morning, we contemplated giving our $65 steak to a bum.",

    "text": "While I was in Vegas in February and waited for my friends to get ready for a night out on the town, I was watching TV and Del Frisco's came on as one of the restaurants in Vegas to try out.  Immediately I bookmarked it and decided to give it a whirl for my birthday this weekend.  I was not disappointed!!  My friend made reservations at 5:30pm on Saturday for our party of three.  Del Frisco's is located a short cab away (about $10 from Encore).  We arrived and were seated immediately.    The Appetizer:  *Steak Tartare - Yummy!  The tartare was tender and flavorful.  I will admit, I did miss the egg you usually mix in, but the dish was still delicious.  The Meat: *Bone in Ribeye Wagyu - Yum! My friend and I decided to split the wagyu since it was a 32 oz cut of meat.  The meat was delicious, extremely flavorful, and cooked to a perfect medium rare.   The Sides: *Spinach Supreme - MMMM...Definitely a must order!  The spinach was creamy and had pieces of bacon in every bite (bacon does make everything better). *Lobster Mac & Cheese - Good.  The top of the dish had a nice panko like crisp to it.  But...where was all the lobster?  I sat there picking through the mac and cheese and noticed there was not much lobster meat. *Chateau Potatoes - Pass. I'm not much of a fan of potatoes so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the dish.  To me, it tasted similar to a warm potato salad.  SERVICE: FABULOUS!  The hostesses greeted us as we walked in and wished me a happy birthday.  Our waitress, Kelsey, was great.  She was helpful, good natured, and friendly.  She checked on us regularly and made sure the meal was to our liking.  While she cut into our meat to make sure it was to our liking, there were three servers going around, each serving us a scoop of one of the sides.  For those looking to also drink, Del Frisco's does have a fully stocked bar.  Oh yeah, one of the cutest things I've seen at a restaurant, in addition to the slice of lemon cake for my birthday, I was given a signed birthday card from the staff.  Thanks to my friends and Del Frisco's to the fabulous birthday dinner!",

    "text": "Wish I could give half stars, but it's about as close to a 5 star as possible. Having been on the Strip for a few days and dining there, my party wanted to venture out a bit, try something new and classy. Ended up here at Del Frisco's. For a restaurant of this class, you would expect impeccable service. Impeccable is exactly what we got. Hostess, waiters and waitresses were all extremely attentive.   Our waiter started off by introducing all the specials they had that night, including their house specialty drink called the \"V.I.P\". Essentially a pineapple juice for adults and it was delicious. Looking at the menu, it was difficult to choose what to order. Started off the dinner with a Del's salad, which was iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, croutons, topped with a light yet flavorful avocado ranch dressing and two strips of bacon.   But what we were here for was definitely the steak. I was tasked with the impossible; trying to choose between the 8 or 12 oz Filet or the 16 ounce Prime Ribeye, but the Ribeye eventually won out. Cooked to exactly my preference of medium-rare with my only complaint being a tad bit too much char. It was definitely a good choice as the marbling was there, but no overwhelming. Flavors and juiciness still intact. When you're nitpicking about the amount of char on the steak, which was pretty negligible, you know the quality you're getting.  However, the highlight of the meal wasn't even the steak; it belonged to the sides and appetizers. That Crab Cake, not a hint of fishiness, paired with a Cajun Lobster Sauce is something to die for. I love the way they serve side dishes also. Family style is definitely the way to go, as it allowed my party to try multiple sides. My favorite sides were the Maque Choux Corn and Chateau potatoes (basically cream corn and mashed/whipped potatoes). Other side dishes available were the Spinach Supreme, Potatoes au Gratin, and the Lobster Mac and Cheese, all of which were great.  Topped off my night with a slice of the lemon cake. Fluffy, light, not too sweet, with a strong hint of the lemon flavor. The priciest dinner I've ever had, but sure was worth every dollar. I would go back in a heartbeat to try the other appetizers and cuts. Highly recommend for the ambience, service, and of course the food.",

Then We were charged twice for the wine.  Again without apologies.    If you are going to 5 stars, you better bring the whole package.  My friend and I had a debate about this and said they don't have  the \"Michael Jordan\" wait staff on a Thursday night and I'm a bit harsh on the score.  My contention is that acknowledging the customer and providing a correct bill is not hitting a phenomenal 30 foot shot to win the game but rather the simple layup with no one guarding you.",

I've had a lot of great steaks, and while the 16 ounce prime strip that I ate half of was excellent, it just wasn't one of the best Ive ever had.  Del Frisco's seasoning is quite overpowering if you aren't ready for it, and by overpowering I mean--SALTYCALAFRAGILISTICEXPIALISALTY!    I tasted all 6 steaks that were served to our table, and all of them were similarly over-salted.  I understand that places like this have their \"style\", and perhaps this is just the way they serve meat. However, for a person who usually gets annoyed with incessant \"Mny dnish nis tnoo snalty\" type people to get salted-out by his chunk of meat, there must be some salt in that mofo!  Four stars are because the service here was awesome.  Our waiter was very nice, and extremely gracious.  He even hesitated to politely inform us that we forgot to tip him on a $600 tab (we assumed the gratuity was already added...our bad).  Piano man with the drum machine and crazy Falsetto was off the hook (he even rocks the synthesized horn section... very chic). He whipped out a smooth jazzy version of Ray Charles's \"You Don't Know Me\"  upon request without batting an eye.  And the MF'n place gives you all the free golf tees and jelly beans that you can carry!!  Damn, I almost wanted to give it five stars just for that! (big golfer here, not so big on jelly beans, but the lady is)  Oh, and the lemon cake was bomb.   4 estrellas.",

    "text": "Went here awhile back when I was in Vegas for a bachelor party.  My buddy picked this place out cause it got so many great reviews.  So we went here on a saturday night before we went out on the strip and this place was packed.  Literally packed.  Even with our reservation, I think we waited a little but I didn't mind that.  It's saturday night and the place was booked.   We finally got seated at our table and after they took our order, they brought us some garlic bread.  I could not stop eating the bread...it was damn good.  It's like they sprinkled crack on it.  I ordered the Porterhouse and the thing was the size of a calf.  Seriously, it might have been the biggest steak I've ever consumed.   24 oz of madness but in a good way.   The steak was very juicy and tender.  They could not have done a better job with this gorgeous piece of meat.   If you're in Vegas, I recommend you check this place out.  Definitely worth it.",

The food was excellent - filet mignon, asparagus, potatoes au gratin, banana bread pudding (must-have).  The ambiance was very classy, the live music was soothing and subtle.  The place is located in an office park just off the Strip on Paradise Road.  Will definitely go again next time we're in town.",

    "text": "This was easily the best steak dinner I have ever had and one of the very best meals I have ever had.  The rib-eye was cooked to perfection - perfect medium-rare and the seasoning was just enough and not overbearing.  I woke up the next day craving another.  The side dishes were all fantastic sounding.  We had the baked macaroni and cheese (with blue cheese as well as other cheeses) and it was out of this world.  The creamed spinach was delicious.    From the warm, freshly baked break brought out to the table, to the dark wood and old-style interior, to the excellent service we had - this place was outstanding.  Their wine list is extensive - think small city phone book.  Many excellent choices.  Not inexpensive but what nice restaurant offers a cheap wine list?  And for Vegas - was actually reasonable.  The food prices were actually very reasonable compared to the hotel steak houses (actually on par or less than the steak houses here in the Bay Area as well.)  And I seriously doubt any one of them is this good.  I WISH this place was here in the Bay Area - I'd go more often (so maybe my waistline wouldn't be so happy!)  For dessert we had their house speciality - the lemon cake.  Ginormous piece (split between 2 or 3 people for sure.)  I am of the mind that if it is not chocolate, why eat it - but this was very, very good.  We shut the place down, literally no one else there but the staff and they never rushed us out while we finished our wine.  Can't say enough about how great the service was.  And yes - bathrooms were spotless and well stocked.  And this was at the very end of the night after a busy Saturday night crowd.  If you want a good steak dinner while in Vegas, I highly recommend veering off the strip (4 minute cab ride from The Wynn) and away from the hotels and coming here.",

I had a fantastic filet, the asparagus with toasted sliced almonds was crisp and tasty. The spinach was great in that it retained the spinach flavor that normally gets lost when you cream it.  The potatoes were good. The sides are huge so we each ordered one and worked them family style.  They had an okay selection of beer but their house pineapple martini, where they soak a pineapple in vodka, let it sit then press it was out of this world.  Totally worth it.",

    "text": "$38 dollars.  That's what it cost for the best piece of meat I have ever tasted and it was worth every penny.  I have been to Morton's, Abe & Louie's, Smith & Wollansky's, Del Frisco's  has them all beat.  It was a 12 oz filet and absolutely amazing.  The sides of creamed corn, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc are well worth it.  We started out with a seafood platter of crab, shrimp and oysters.  Fantastic but too much if you are getting a entree.  The service was outstanding, waited on hand and foot by a warm, friendly and knowledgable staff.  \r \r The wine list is a dream list for the wine lover however the mark up is way too high except for the high rollers.  Best deal on the list was the Salentin Malbec for $40, (retails for $18).  Great time and will be back when the wallet can afford it.  If you hit the Vegas location, ask for Josh.  Great server!",

    "text": "I had never really heard of this place before my initial visit. We came here during one of our Legendary Vegas trips. It was an extremely early dinner. Had to be because we had a long night of boozing ahead of us and let's face it. Nobody wants to throw up a $90 meal.  Del Frisco's is an amazing steak house that prides themselves on quality food and service that makes you feel like a king. We were a party of approximately 12. We had very polite and courteous waitress that I honestly wouldn't mind taking home to momma. She was amazing. Despite lame advances of my friend at the end of the dinner, she kept it professional. Aside from her, they had an army of servers. No joke. Our drinks were refilled constantly. Never were our cups half full.  The steak itself was amazing. I got the Prime Ribeye and it was cooked exactly how I like it. Slightly bloody, still twitching and spiced to perfection. The side dishes are family style. We ordered a hand full of them that covered everyone. I wasn't as impressed with the side as my friends were but they complimented the meal very well. As soon as the sides came out, the army of servers circled the table and attacked, literally...  \"Sir, would you like some corn?\" \"Sir, would you like some Potatoes Au Gratin?\"\" \"Sir, would you like some Asparagus?\" \"Sir, would you like some Mac and Cheese?\"  It was quite overwhelming, but in a good way. Great service. Definitely a spot I would recommend if you're looking for a pretty money steakhouse in LV.",

I recommend a special I was fond of years ago that is not mentioned anymore, but they are willing to make for you if you ask for it. It is 3 pieces of Filet (about 3 ounces ea.), each cooked to your preference and topped with 3 different sauces. 1) is a cream sauce with crab, 2) is a butter truffle sauce (my favorite) and 3) (I cannot remember, go find out weirdo). I also usually order a side of something green and 99% of the time it's the butter, sauteed broccoli. The wine selection is great and the bar is very good. Tip the piano player, tip the excellent service and before you leave, ask about the secret JAMES BOND TABLE (it's so frakn cool)!",

The interior was wood grained and elegant, typical for a steakhouse of its stature.    The sesame bread served upon sitting was nothing spectacular, I would have preferred the onion rolls served at Morton's.  The wine menu was several pages long, it was fun just perusing through the different varieties of wine (most which I couldn't afford).  I ordered the bone-in ribeye like the rest of my party, it was superb.  The seasoning was absolutely perfect, each bite was divine.  The sides were excellent, I've never tasted such exquisite potatoes au gratin and macaroni and cheese like that before.    The lemon cake was good, but nothing to write home about.  The service was excellent, for the servers were very knowledgeable, but never seemed hurried at all.  Not a cheap place, but I think everyone should treat themselves occasionally, especially in Vegas.    Overall a great experience, and they even sent a handwritten thank you card!",

That being said, my husband and I were in LV for our 10th wedding anniversary, and Del Frisco's came highly recommended.  When our hotel made the reservation, the restaurant was informed it was a special ocassion and we were treated like royalty!  Atmosphere is romatically dim, hushed voices, pleasant music overhead.   Food. OH MY GOODNESS!!  My husband had the apptizer special of Alaskan crab legs - a huge plate full. I had the hand-crafted onion rings, to die for!  Prime Rib, and my fillet were cooked to perfection. Their meat is 'wet aged', and perfectly cooked!! Tender, not mushy, didn't need the steak knife at all!   Service: Since it was a very special ocassion, we got lots of attention! The resaurant was pretty empty when we arrived for a 5pm reservation and by 6pm, the bar was full and patrons were arriving for dinner, and the service was still great! We took a limo to and from the restaurant, and our server called for the car, walked us outside to say goodnight. Very special evening.  I agree with the other reviews, the Lemon Cake - HEAVEN! We left the restaurant dizzy with food overload!",

The restaurant was empty (and its SAT night...hmm....) other than one table for two in which they seat us right next to that table......and by the back area where all of the servers hang out and talk LOUDLY.  The service was not great as the only other table that came in was a large party of 12 which they shifted tables and put them right next to us.  So, our server completely abandons us and goes to help them. (Why not one of the other 20 servers standing there talking?????)  I had to finally flag down someone to get our check!  Food was ok, nothing spectacular, just OK.  Too many other fabulous steak and seafood places to go to for the same price point such as Mastro's which I highly recommend.  MUCH better ambience and top notch service there at Mastros! Del Frisco is an outdated, stuffy feeling place and for what ever reason, it smells like the sewer in there but it may be just the old carpet.  DEFINITELY needs updating.  There are too many other great places in Vegas to go here again...not for us!",

Dimly lit, beautiful decor, pleasant waitstaff.     I chose to get the filet mignon/jumbo shrimp and our table split a bunch of sides.  The filet was juicy, tender, and literally melted in my mouth.  The shrimp were HUGE, and very flavorful. I recommend the macaroni and cheese-it's the first time I've ever had blue cheese mac n' cheese and I was pleasantly surprised!!  My friend was very ambitious, and decided to order the pound and a half bone-in ribeye and proceeded to eat the entire thing. Very impressive.  They also hooked up our table with some free desserts because we were celebrating two birthdays!    I definitely recommend this place if you are craving a delicious steak and overall amazing dining experience!",

I am completely satisfied by this response and look forward to dining at the upcoming Del Frisco's in Pittsburgh, PA to give them another shot and hopefully more positive review!  Original experience below.  Pro tip: if you aren't satisfied, speak up!  They can only make it right if you tell them.  16 oz Prime ribeye had little marbling, tough veins of gristle and was so over salted and peppered that all steak flavor was completely overwhelmed.  medium rare was totally purple for all but the 1/8th inch around the edge.  I didn't send it back because I don't mind rate and don't like drama, but comeGetting it cooked right is pass and catch and should not be a struggle for a dedicated steakhouse.    Easily the worst prime grade steakhouse steak I've eaten.  Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Hyde park, and any of the big chains, etc. are better.   Super disappointing for the high end price point.  2 stars instead of 1 because the stone bar is really cool, but seriously, an Outback steak would be better.",

Sides (asparagus and mashed potatoes) came after we ate our steaks. 1/2 the table was served the other half waited and waited and waited. The excuse \"we are busy tonight\" then turn people away if you cannot provide quality food and service because I paid for a good meal and service and I did not get that.

    "text": "I was really looking forward to going to this place. The reviews are great, we've heard from friends how great this place is, the food, the service, double eagle, blah, blah, blah. Well DON'T waste your money here, if you want all that go to Hugo's Cellar at a fraction of the price. I will give my food review then the service review. Disclaimer: We went on Valentine's Day 2/14/18 this is our anniversary. When we made reservations they asked us if this was a special occasion we said yes and we understood the busyness of this day so maybe just maybe this review would have been different had it been any other day.   We had ice tea and coke, the tea was good and the soda was brought in a small glass coke bottle and a glass of ice, which is typical of a higher end restaurant. We don't drink so I can't review the wine service although the wine selection is extensive. We also were brought a small loaf of sesame bread with butter while we waited for our dinner.  I had their Del Frisco's salad with their avocado ranch type dressing. It was a typical tossed salad with two cherry tomatoes sliced in half, two croutons and two thick slices of bacon across the top. Was it worth $11.00 well no, but the price is also typical of this type of restaurant. The bacon was very thick and was serve in whole pieces. I had to use the butter knife provided to cut the bacon which was not effective so I had to use my hands not a big deal but I would have preferred the bacon pre-cut or a knife provided.  For sides which are family style and ala cart we had the lobster and cheese mac at 18.00, as well as the creamed spinach 12.50.  Both were decent and flavorful, the lobster mac n cheese was well worth the price. I would say it was delicious and the lobster in the mac n cheese was very tender more so than the lobster tail we ordered. (More on the lobster tail below). The cream spinach was good and flavorful.  We also each had ordered the prime rib eye at $58 dollars.  What we received was the prime strip which was also $58 we didn't get what we had ordered and I did not realize it until my husband pointed it out but it was so busy and the prime strip was delicious cooked to perfection.  This is probably why I'm giving this review 3 stars. The horseradish sauce was very good I had the creamy my husband had the raw horseradish.   My husband ordered the broiled lobster tail which is carved table side. At $6 an oz. this was very pricey. We had the 16 oz enough to share with each other. The lobster unfortunately was by no means tender and the heated butter which was served with it was flavorless this was a huge disappointment to both myself and my husband. (Hugo's cellar lobsters were a bit smaller, but very tender and a fraction of the cost, also carved table side)  Service: the service was good despite the Valentine \"holiday\" crowd. We had a nice young lady named Erica she did her job well despite the wrong order of the steak. The problem I think we had was the restaurant is very large and has several rooms to serve the crowd that came, although they only used one room to serve the crowd so it was very crowded and very, very loud not at all an intimate setting. I'm sure there is reasoning for this but we noticed two separate room tables ready but no one in either of these rooms. We were really having a hard time talking to each other and we heard everyone's conversations close to us and even sitting three tables down, I assume because everyone was trying to talk over each other. It was just really loud no at all what I expected.   We've been to Hugo's and for Valentine's Day we would have to make reservations three months in advance which we will next time. I just had to compare what you get for the price you pay and the value even for these higher price places for which some people money is no object . For my husband he works hard and his way that he splurges is through his stomach he loves food and loves to try new places. He had to admit he didn't think it was worth the cost. When you can get a great steak elsewhere in town at a fraction of the cost why would you go somewhere and spend the amount and it's just not worth it. Restaurants that have steaks just as great are listed below: Hugo's Cellar  Herb's n Rye (Go during happy hour the steaks are half price)  Golden steer",

Five years ago we held our wedding reception here complete with 21 close family and friends. Best choice we could have made. The servers were very attentive then, and 5 years later they still uphold the same high level of attentiveness. Just the right amount too. Not like some places where your server is back at your table every 5 minutes to the point where you wish they would just let you enjoy your food!  Let's talk about food. EVERYTHING, and I do mean EVERYTHING on this menu has your food palate watering! Deciding what to order is going to be tuff, but no worries, you won't be disappointed with your final decision. Portions are very generous, and in direct proportion to the quality and price for your meal. Desert anyone? Okay, but you'll have to get it to go it you plan on finishing it. Cheesecake is my favorite. The 7 layer lemon cake is my husband's favorite.   Oops! Almost forgot mention that you must start the night with their signature VIP's!!!!!!!  If your ever in the Dallas TX area visit that location as well. You will be greeted with the same great service, food, and overall experience!",

The service was interesting...it was sort of awful for how many people were around and checking in on us. but they were also super aware and did a lot to try to make it better.  Hiccups included : taking away our bread plates after we asked for more bread, needing us to ask for wine / drink top ups multiple times, overcooking our steaks, coming in confused when they came to check in, apologizing a tonne.  That said, they were super nice about the whole thing, and gave us 25% off.  They were also nice enough to give the birthday girl a card, and let us bring in our own cake without a cake fee.    All in all, I'd try them again.",

Everyone from the host to the manager and sommelier made sure our experience was extraordinary. I highly recommend getting the full experience and starting with some crab cakes, followed by a house salad paired with a recommended wine, and spoiling yourself with lobster and steak. My boyfriend ordered the tomahawk steak and I have no idea how they perfectly caramelized it on the outside, JUST on the outside, and kept every centimeter inside perfectly cooked to order. My boyfriend ordered his steak med rare, and no part of it was cooked differently. They carved my lobster for me at the table, and brought me a heated saucer with butter to dip, as well as bringing me garlic butter I asked for.  Do yourself a favor and get dessert too, we had a dessert cocktail that tasted like it was made with haagan daz ice cream, as well as the cinnamon white chocolate creme brulee that tasted like horchata! Our server went above and beyond, but honestly the managers served as just as much as she did! They are so hands on here, and every detail was minded by the entire staff. Thank you del Frisco's for being a huge highlight of our trip to Vegas. Next time, I'm getting the biggest lobster!",

We also got complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. They literally served two full desserts on a plate. I've seen it where fancy restaurants give a small tasting of dessert but this was two full size ones and they were unbelievably good. The chocolate lava cake and the butter cake, unreal.  The dinner was delicious but even more memorable was the service! Our waitress (we can't remember her name but do remember she lived and/or was from NJ) was really amazing! She was very attentive and energetic and made our meal very enjoyable.   The food was also really great. We had a gift certificate from the holidays to use here and so we got a lot of different dishes to try. We had the Caesar salad, bacon appetizer, crab cakes, and porterhouse for one. The sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. My favorites were the bacon, Caesar salad, and mashed potatoes.   I was absolutely recommend this restaurant! It's pretty close to the strip and was just a $7 LYFT ride. Try it and hopefully you get the same waitress we had!",

This year we happen to be visiting Las Vegas the weekend prior and had received an open table gift card for Christmas. We had many restaurants to choose from and after about 4 hours of my reading reviews we chose this one. My first impression of this place was that they were professional, a few days prior we received a reminder phone call. All though I was looking forward to the dinner and had not forgotten it was a nice gesture. We arrived early, mostly because we are really prompt people. We were seated very quickly at a really sweetly set table. It had rose petals and a card signed by the staff wishing us a Happy anniversary. Our waiter Roland was extremely knowledgeable of the menu. Our meal consisted of the following   Starter  SHANGHAI-STYLE FRIED CALAMARI Dinner THE DOUBLE EAGLE\" 45 DAY DRY AGED DOUBLE BONE PRIME RIBEYE CREAMED SPINACH CHATEAU MASHED POTATOES The steak was cooked perfect, all the sides are shareable we ordered to much, one would have been enough.",

Seafood platter was fantastic, the crab cake was unlike anything I've ever had. The steaks for 24 people were all brought out at the same time and were all perfectly cooked to order.

I heard great reviews about the other locations so I was excited to try Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House.  I'm a carnivore and I dine at a lot of Steak Houses.  My friend said that she loves the New York location and the decor but to me the Las Vegas location falls below par.  It did not wow me at all.   The restaurant looked very busy.  We were seated at the back room on the right side when you enter.  Now, go figure with my luck that the restroom (only 1) is located at the other end of the restaurant.  :(    Our server was very nice and attentive.  She took the time to do a group shot of me and my friends.   Food:  22 oz Double Eagle Bone-In Prime Strip Lobster Macaroni & Cheese Baked Potato Baked Potato  Dessert:  Lemon Cake that was delicious  This restaurant did not leave me wanting to return at all and I was hoping it would.  It was not intimate but a loud atmosphere.   Props to the marketing/management team who sends out the thank you cards.  I did appreciate that.",

So good! The sides come in proportions, big enough to feed 2-3 people so it's well worth the money to get a couple and share! Will definitely be back!",

THE ESCARGOT WAS DIVINE ! great choice. Then Shanghai Style Fried calamari was DELICIOUS! Then came the steaks! we order the Filet Mignon and The Porterhouse steak .. Both medium rare UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE JUST DRY AND OVERLY SALTY. There was no juices left on the steak as if it was old, frozen or somebody had taken a towel and soaked all the juices out of the steak . no a single drop of juice on my plate . just a dry steak with some toppings .  i was very disappointed with the steak quality in this steakhouse,i didn't even finish my steak as i normally would clean my plate i left craving a good steak more then when i first entered. i have definitely had better",

There was a glitch in their reservation system and somehow our reservation was cancelled but the problem was handled promptly and we were seated right away,  Our server was Ro and she was great!  She was knowledgeable about the food and recommended a special cocktail that was delicious and she made us feel welcome. I ordered the filet and my husband had the ribeye. We also ordered the creamed spinach and Del Frisco's potatoes. Both steaks were outstanding and the sides complimented the meal perfectly. We brought a special bottle of Cabernet to enjoy which made the meal even more special. I would highly recommend dining at Del Frisco's for a truly special dining experience.",

But not confined or stuffy, just a classic San Francisco style steakhouse ( from Dallas). Food was top notch. We'll prepared and presented. We were three couples celebrating our anniversary. Table was sprinkled with fresh rose petals and anniversary cards signed by the staff. Our waiter, Freddis was very helpful and attentive all night without hovering or rushing us. We actually spent over three hours with drinks, appetizers, dinner and dessert (including a very nice trio of complimentary anniversary desserts). We all ordered off the Restaurant week menu plus other appetizers to start. Most had the files and ALL said they were probably the best steaks ever! I had the files medallions, excellent. My wife had the crab cakes. She thought they were ok but I tasted them and they were very good with huge lumps of crab meat. We were treated exceptionally well and we will go back for sure! Oh before I forget, the piano player and singer in the bar area was very accomplished and contemporary. I did not get his name but great music to accompany a great meal. Thank you Del Frisco's steakhouse!",

We order 4 apps (2 calamari 2 bacon slice) 5 sides (onion rings,Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese, and the wild mushrooms) and everything tasted great. The servers served us all the sides and made sure our steak was cooked to our preference. I mentioned to my friends that sometimes fine dining is alittle salty and the waitress overheard me say that and offered to cook me another steak. What SERVICE. But my Steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great. Will  be in rotation every time I come to Sin City. Thank you Del Frisco Las Vegas for a memorable dinner",

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation but ended up waiting about ten minutes.  At first, I was somewhat disappointed with the wait on a reservation, but I found out that since they had a last minute cancellation, we were moved to the Wine Cellar Room - probably the best room in the house in my opinion.  The wine cellar room was beautiful.  It made for a very personal but grand feel for our special dinner.  The service and food were top notch.  For dinner, we ordered a few appetizers, which were a good start.  Salads were good but unremarkable - your basic wedge salads.  The dinner was the star.  The entire party ordered a mix of the house specialty long-bone wagyu Rib-Eyes and Bone-in Strips.  Every steak without exception was cooked to temp perfectly.  The family style sides were presented by the servers and portioned on each of our plates for us - a mix of lobster mac and cheese, potatoes au gratin, and creamed spinach.  Of course my favorite part of dinner was the wine.  As usual, and especially to accompany a good steak, we enjoyed 2010 Far Niente Cabernet - made for an excellent pairing to the steaks as expected.  After dinner, we had to forego dessert as those tomahawk steaks were huge.",

    "text": "I've had my fair share of steakhouses in Vegas and Del Frisco's rises to the top of the list. I like that it's not part of a casino that houses a steakhouse with marked up prices just to bring in the cash. That isn't to say that the prices are cheap, because they aren't, but Del Frisco's knows how to cook a steak. I came with my group of friends who were visiting for my friend's 30th birthday. The majority of us ended up ordering the $55 Sunday Prime Pair, which was a surf & turf of sorts, pairing an 8 oz. filet with a seafood option.  I started with the Del's salad, which had two big crispy strips of bacon to go along with salad topped with an avocado Caesar dressing. Next, I opted for the filet paired with the lemon-garlic scallops and fried capers. This piece of filet was one of the best, if not, the best cooked piece of steak I've ever had. When you say medium-rare, they actually cook it perfectly through and through. It was red and hot in the center and tender beyond belief. I enjoyed the scallops and the signature crab cake I tried was good too. But the focus was all on the filet. For sides, we shared the spinach supreme, chateau potatoes, baked potato, and maque choux corn. The portions were big enough for everyone to share each other's sides. My favorite was split between the spinach and the corn. Unless, you count the lobster mac 'n cheese as a side, which we also ordered. One order was more than enough to share between 7 people, but we went ahead and got a second for good measure. They don't skimp out on the lobster either. By some mix-up, we also ended up with truffle butter for our steaks. Yes, it was that extravagant.  The meal ended with a delicious pecan cheesecake topped with caramel. Many steakhouses have the same menu with similar salads, sides, and seafood. But, Del Frisco's just does it a little bit better. It's easy to drop more than a bill here, but remember what to order: the filet, lobster mac 'n cheese, maybe the spinach supreme. You will be set.",

My husband got the ribeye with the bone marrow sauce on the side and it was divine!  You cannot go wrong with this place.   We also got an order of their lemon cake which was on steroids it was so huge.  Unlike most cakes it wasn't cloyingly sweet and it was quite refreshing to eat after our indulgent meal.  We had a party of 11 and surprisingly they did not include gratuity on the bill.    Perfect dinner and it was great service.  The drinks are served stiff and the meat is well done!

The server who I forget what his name was found out it was my birthday so he brought me a signed birthday card and lemon cake with  a candle I thought that was very sweet.

Over the long term, service has been consistently excellent and the steaks are flavorful and delicious.   When your server remembers your name (and you remember hers...Pam - she rocks) and she remembers what drink you ordered and what drink your wife ordered on your last visit a month ago and treats you like an old friend it doesn't get better than that.    The rib eye (no bone) is my favorite.  I have had the tomahawk wagyu and that is excellent as well but I can never finish it because the portion is like Fred Flintstone size. The sides are simple and give your palette a variety. I focus on eating the juicy and delicious ribeye and hardly touch the sides or dessert.   Del Frisco...They know how it's done!",

Our server was super friendly and he joked around w us as we took thug life pictures w the ginormous steak knives they gave us. (Yes, my friends and I are the pillars of maturity =))We started off with the crabcake. ( notice I say cake and not cakes) They only give you one, but shoot that one crabcake was probably one of the best ive tried. Surrounded by a creamy delicious sauce that was almost like a soup of its own, the crab cake was indeed FULL of crab. Advice: dip bread in sauce as not to let the sauce go to waste.. its bomb! Got the Bone in Rib eye, its 22 oz, so my friend and I shared. Zommg! Now that is steak, perfectly crispy salty on the outside, pink center on the inside, you will not leave one bite leftover. I usually don't eat the fat, but shoot their fat was even good! Mmm faaaatttt..    Our server told us that the sides are pretty big, they are kind of family style here, so we shared broccoli in white wine and garlic sauce, and lobster mac and cheese, both of which were plentiful and suppppperb in taste! And our steaks were paired perfectly with the wine we chose, a Spanish wine called Termes. Look for it, it was wonderful and well priced.. someone once told me to avoid the well known area wines like from napa or sonoma because they tend to be priced upwardly just because they are well known.. okay I think I just realized that someone is Rachel Ray. Haha sometimes I think the food network people are my friends.. now Im off topic. Anyway, it was a great meal, wonderful evening, and an awesome way to kick off the vegas weekend!",

    "text": "3.5 stars for the food  4 stars for the ambiance and service  I just couldn't bring myself to rate it a 4 star.  Well, I took the BF to LV for his birthday and took him to eat here on 8/25 bcz of all the raving reviews!   The atmosphere of this place is great, they have an intimate side and a social gathering side! A little bit more of a relaxed feeling than Morton's or Ruth Chris. Not too uppity and not too business like.   The negatives:  -Lamb chops. It didn't melt in my mouth compared to Ruth Chris. Not that great of a seasoning, just salt and pepper. I should not be able to have an after taste of salt (table salt) on my tongue for hours after dinner.   -Sauteed mushrooms. OMG WTF!!! When the hostess brought that next to me I said BUTTON MUSHROOMS with a snotty attitude and a look!! But I calmed down and tried the mushrooms anyway.   Let me tell you how disappointing this is! For a pricey restaurant to serve their guests BUTTON MUSHROOMS that is just a BIG NO NO!! Button mushrooms are not gourmet and cannot carry a gourmet flavor. Let's just say McCormick and Schmidt's sauteed mushrooms is what I was expecting! On top of that the mushrooms weren't even sliced, they were served whole. The flavor was there, but the BUTTON MUSHROOMS just ruined the flavor.  -The BF's steak tenderloin was good, but not great. Again too much salt. It tastes like table salt! It may just be me. But again having an after taste of salt in your mouth for hours after dinner and even with dessert not impressed.   The positives:  -Great service.   -Great atmosphere.   -Delicious crab cake, mac n cheese, and asparagus! Previous yelpers were right on those recommendations!   -Great concept on having women hostess serve you the sides. Each hostess has a side and serves it to each guest. (although I would have appreciated the girls looking cuter and dressed sexier than that evening, I like pretty people, plus it's Vegas a city to impress)   -The restroom: I've never been to a restaurant where there was a bathroom attendant before.   All in all, I would recommend this restaurant only if they had a pre-fixed menu. Or if you are having an important business transaction.",

I totally fell in love with this place right when I walked in. We ordered the Crab Cake as an appetizer, and it was SO good! Probably the best Crab Cake I ever had. We had 3 rib-eyes and a surf and turf. The steaks were amazing. I think we had about 6-7 people serving us. We felt like a king or something haha. One of the waiters accidentally took my side dish away. When I found out, I asked the waiter and he said he will be right back. Guess what. He came back with the whole new mac & cheese and sauteed mushroom as a sorry. I was..\"wow!\"   The food and the service were AMAZING! You won't be disappointed. I would highly recommend this place to all my friends and family.",

    "text": "Inside the place certainly seems like a steakhouse, and the menu looks impressive.  However it fell short of my expectations.  The menu carries high end steakhouse prices for items which are below that quality.  Everything was prepared well, and the meal was decent, but the price we paid was not representative of the food we received.  In all honesty, there are quite a few better steakhouses in this city, and ones which are more deserving of the money paid.  I had a shrimp cocktail appetizer which was very boring.  The three gourmet sauces were nothing unique or impressive, and I was forced to try them if I wanted the shrimp as each shrimp was bathed in one of them.  The filet oscar was decent, and at 8 oz a reasonably sized protion.  However it was not worth the money as my oscar treatment contained only a tiny bit of crab and diced asparagus (which wasn't even properly cooked).  I tried some of the lobster tail ordered by a friend, and it was okay, but absolutely not worth the $90 pricetag for the \"12 oz tail\" which wasn't even close to that size - perhaps it was the tail of a 12 oz lobster.  Dinner was enjoyable, the service was outstanding.  But if you truly enjoy steak, go to a real steakhouse.  You will spend the same amount of money, but you will receive a FAR better meal.",

Food was absolutely delicious, everything was cooked to perfection, steak was mouth-watering and crab cakes were so meaty and tasty. The service was also great, the waiters were unbelievably attentive and the manager made a point of coming over to chat and make sure everything was okay.  We were driving so didn't get a chance to try the cocktails but hearing the waiter describe the VIP cocktail made me want to abandon the car and try it out!  Would 100% go back next time we go to Vegas! Don't think I could fault them on a single thing!",

    "text": "On my last night in Vegas, I went to check out this place on the recommendation of a friend. She said it was the best steak place she's ever been to, and since I love steak, I simply had to try it out. I figured that it would be expensive (which it was), but who cares, it was compliment of the casinoes anyway =D.  The hostesses were cute, the setting was dark, good for romantic dinners. They even had a cool piano where this one musician played music on throughout the night. All the servers/bartenders were well dressed with tuxedos. Great, the atmosphere looks nice and fancy, but that's not that important to me. I care more about the food, and this place had better deliver. I had really high expectations of the food coming into the place...   And boy, did Del Frisco's ever deliver. I ordered the 16oz Prime Rib since there was no way I was going to finish the house special Double Eagle Strip on my own. That piece of steak was definitely one of the best I've ever had. It was so full of flavor that you could practically eat it without the steak sauce. The meat was so tender and juicy (ordered medium rare) that I cut through it like butter. I also had the spinach supreme on the side and it was good, despite the fact that I thought the mix of onions, mushrooms, and bacon bits were weird. Their bread was also very soft and their butter was very creamy... very simple to spread on the butter.  Service was exceptional. Though I don't really care about service as much as I do about the food, it was nice being pampered. They made sure my steak was cooked right when it was brought out. My water was filled constantly without me having to ask . And since I'm such a slow eater, when my food got cold, they reheated it for me, and even though it's no longer medium rare, it was still around medium-ish and very tender.   One disappointment: after reading some of the other reviews, I realized that I didn't get a chance to check out this James Bond table. Argh, that would've been a nice photograph to have!  Overall, if you're a steak lover, this place is a must-visit. The expensive price may discourage us normal people from visiting often, but since I visit Vegas once a year, it was worth the trip.",

Located on Paradise Road, it is about 10 mins taxi ride from most of the hotels (we stayed at Palazzo which was about 1.5 miles away). We were a party of 11 people and they seated us in one of their many dining rooms with spacious seating and lighting. Service is quick and attentive, our water glasses never went below half full. Many at our table ordered the VIP cocktail - vodka and pineapples - and they said it was great. We ordered 5 crab cakes (2 entrees and 1 appetizer) to start off and these crab cakes is unlike any that you probably have tried or will try elsewhere - pan fried instead of battered and deep fried, almost no filler, pure crab meat chunks. Well worth the price. The table ordered various cuts / sizes of the steaks, from the 22oz prime ribeye to the double eagle, and all agreed that the steaks were well seasoned, cooked to perfection. We also ordered for sides the lobster mac and cheese (can taste lobster chunks), asparagus, potato au gratin, which were all good. When I made the reservations via phone, I told them it was for 3 peoples birthdays. At the end of dinner, they brought out 3 of their signature desserts with a candle on them to the table (desserts on the house) which was great service. Amazing staff.",

    "text": "I was not that impressed with Del Frisco's.  I can understand how some people like it, but not me.   I went on a business dinner.    The ambiance is very nice traditional steakhouse, and very well done.  Dark.  Lots of wood.  Staff dressed well.  The steaks are served a la carte for the most part.  Order veggies separately.  Plenty of choices.  By and large the steak were decent.  I had the fillet trio, with three different sauces and was satisfied.  You have to figure how the do their meat here before ordering medium, medium rare, etc.  They explained to me how the do their meats, and I order medium, and got it how I like it, warm pink middle.  That being said, 1 associate ordered his medium, and got rare, and another medium, and received medium well.  Asparagus, grilled mushrooms, potatoes were nothing to write home about.  Wine list was very comprehensive, and way overpriced.  Very difficult to find a good deal on the wines.  I felt that the big wine list was to impress and confuse.  I was in charge of ordering wines, and found a few good bottles.  I tried to use the sommelier to make sense of the wines, and the one he suggested, was the most expensive, and worst wine we ordered.  Service can be perceived as \"attentive\" or \"intrusive\".  I always felt they were trying to \"up sell\".  More expensive cut here, more expensive wine there, trying to get more appertizers or bottles of wine on the table before we were finished with the ones we had (this happened three times, one time is good services) as we were winding down.  We spent about $150/person so I expect more.",

    "text": "YEAHHHHHHHHHH MANNNNNNNNNN!  We ordered the Power Couple deal, which I believe is for their restaurant week or something. The deal was quite a steal. Each person gets: Salad, 1 crab cake AND 8oz. filet mignon, 2 sides, and a choice of dessert for $99.  - Del's Salad: one of the best & beastliest salads ever. I'm not much of a salad person, but I didn't feel like less of a man for eating this. It came with super fresh cabbage and veggies, with 2 very deeelicious strips of bacon laid on top. The wonderful avocado-based house dressing brought all the components of the salad together. I forced myself to eat only half, for I wanted to finish the rest of my meal. - Off-menu bone-in filet mignon 16oz: This phenomenal piece of meat went for $60. They allowed us to upgrade the steak in the power couple deal for an extra $25. So glad I did this. I've eaten at a lot of steak- Mastro's/Morton's/Ruth's Chris/Lawry's etc etc, and I gotta say that the steak I had here was one of the best I've had. - 8oz filet mignon: My gf had this one, and I tried a bite, of course. This was even more tender than the steak I had. - Crab cake: Heavenly? Delightful? Fabulous? Blissful? Whatever. Best crab cake I've ever had, no argument there. Not your typical crab cake - it's just layered chunks of juicy beautiful savory crab meat formed into a cake of perfection. - Lobster Mac & Cheese: Not included in the power couple deal; we ordered this separately $16. Yes, I loved this, too. - Alaskan King Crab Legs: $49. Huge legs. My friend said it was the best $49 for crab that he's ever spent. - Sides: We pretty much got all the available sides - the spinach, veggie of the day was broccoli, potatoes.  - VIP cocktail: it's from those large jars they have with pineapples in them. The ladies seemed to a be a big fan of it. - Cheesecake: We ordered the strawberry cheesecake and the butterscotch cheesecake. We were crazy stuffed, but it was so good that we still ate most of it.  All steaks were cooked perfectly, except for one of our's (5 of us). She said some of the outside portions of her filet mignon were a little burned. The servers here did a great job of making sure the steaks were cooked to our liking, but my friend didn't bother saying anything because she didn't want to wait another 20 minutes. What I really liked was the hospitality & service of every single employee. When your entree comes out.. it seems like the entire staff comes out to swarm your table to give you your steaks & scoop ur sides for you. That experience in itself makes this place very unique and memorable.  We sat at a table located next to a bar, where a guy was playing jams on the piano. Awesome. I also noticed that there were many other rooms/sections in the place, hopefully we'll try the others out next time. Located slightly off the strip, this Del Frisco's has the feel/vibe that it's been around for a while... and it'll probably stay around for much longer, for very good reason.  Cliff Notes: If you want to have a nice steak dinner in Vegas, you have to eat here.",

I know the place can get crazy packed during peak time so the review is based on how it's like when it's not crazy packed.  Food: Basically it's meat or seafood here. I came for the meat as the name of the restaurant contains the word Steak. Their steaks did not disappoint. I ordered the porter house medium and it was cooked to perfection and my GF ordered the filet mignon medium well and it was perfect for her too. Shanghai calamari was excellent. Basically fried calamari with sweet and spicy sauce, although it was sweeter than spicy.   Service: Excellent! Food was half the better, service is the other and they nailed both. Our waitress was in training so it was kind of interesting to see the person training her and how he was shadowing her every move and whispering in her ears what to say. Water refilled constantly, our waitress always checked up on us even after food was served. I don't mind tipping more for service like this.   Price: Cheaper than the steak house on the strip. Comparing it mainly to the prices at Craft Steak. Their 8 ounce filet mignon cost more than Del Frisco's 10 ounce.   Portions: Even though it's a la cart style of ordering, the portions are huge.   Bonus: Received a Christmas card from our waitress, handwritten! Priceless!",

Since we were on a schedule, told the waiter we could only stay for an hour and change, and he totally accommodated us. We were out the door in exactly the time we wanted to leave.  The restaurant interior and ambiance is very nice. Looks a bit like a old fancy saloon. I had the lamb and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Also enjoyed my dish with a side of au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach which were richly creamy and succulent. The place has a couple plasma TVs, so my brother and I were able to catch the Ohio St./USC game, which was awesome!  The service here is impeccable. Our waiter was always attentive, friendly and helpful on suggestions whenever we had questions about anything. Overall, it was a great experience. I wouldn't come here every week though, since the prices are sky-high, but hey, when you're in Vegas you have to splurge once in a while. :)",

    "text": "I would fly to Vegas from San Francisco, just to have a meal here. It's worth it. It's THAT good. No - it's better than good. It's Steak, done to perfection. Here are the highlights: I made my decision 100% using Yelp. I read that their customer service was stellar, and the food was amazing. Those were my two main criteria. Del Frisco's completely exceeded my expectations.   1) On the phone from SF when I called a week before the trip, they didn't treat me like just another voice on the other end of the line. The hostess answered all my anal-retentive questions. Then she offered to fax me the menu (it's not on their website) - nice touch. I wanted to make sure they had seafood, as well as steak, and I also wanted to make sure their prices weren't out of control. Their menu looked straightforward and simple, not a lot of fancy descriptions, just meat, and how many ounces, etc. I was a little nervous when I found out there are 8 other locations, I normally steer clear of \"chains\" but this place really has defined what steakhouse should be, and they were really personal in every way.  2) Once in Vegas: Just me and my Mama at the restaurant. Early reservations because we had to make the Bette Midler show at 7:30pm at Caesar's. We show up and are the ONLY ones in the restaurant. Semi embarrassed because the place holds like 800 people, it's huge. They kindly invited us into the bar to wait 15 minutes, because the kitchen wasn't fully open yet. Bartender Robby poured us some cocktails. He told us his favorite cut is the Ribeye. My mom was slightly salivating by this point. She loves a good steak, and this is why I wanted to impress her.  3) We ordered the Jumbo Crab Cake with Creole Sauce, it was wowza! They didn't put a whole lot of bread crumbs or fillers in it, just basically pure crab meat and seasonings. It was buttery and perfectly cooked. The sauce was so good, I could have drank it - neat.  4) We split the porterhouse. It was 24 ounces, including the bone. Our waiter Ryan was patient, attentive and super informative. When our steaks arrived, he did the \"tasting\" which other reviews have mentioned, slicing 2 pieces for each guest tableside, and then waiting for the reaction... it was UNREAL. I have never had a steak like this. When I asked him how it was so flavorful, he said it's BROILED. He didn't act all pompous, like it was some trade secret... he let us know their ovens are 1500 F degrees and that's what gives them their perfect sear on the outside. We asked for the Porterhouse = Medium. It was like butter. My mom couldn't wait to get her hands on the bone, which still had quite a bit of meat on it. Oh yeah, it was THAT good. Bone-sucking good.  5) We also ordered a side of bearnaise sauce, but we really didn't need it; the steak's seasonings were perfect as is. And we ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms. Their #1 side is the Potatoes Au Gratin, Ryan told us. Too heavy for us.  6) For dessert, we got a special little surprise. The lemon cake on the menu was some kind of Southern Lemon cake I'd never heard of before. When Ryan described this decadent cake: 7 layers, buttercream, lemon glaze... I said, 'you should put the description you just recited on the menu!\" It was lacking any description at all, and I thought that was strange for a lesser known dessert to skip the details. Five minutes later he emerges with a piece of this cake, on the house! It was sooo tasty and zingy! Lemon to the power of 10. He said, \"I saw your eyes light up when I told you what was in the cake!\" Really super cute of him. Of course we couldn't finish this huge slice, after such a rich steak, but I loved lemon, so I was super happy I got to taste it.  7) This place is a class act all the way. They know how to make the customers feel totally at home. And as for the price, our 24 ounce porterhouse came in at just under $50. Comparatively speaking, this is very reasonable for fine steakhouses in Vegas. At the MGM Grand, the Porterhouse at their signature CraftSteak restaurant was $92. We didn't go there, just checked out their menu. I think it was a larger cut, but nevertheless its half the overhead of the hotel you end up paying for. Del Frisco's is a short $8 cab ride off the strip, and I would go back again and again and again.",

On walking in, we were warmly greeted by a hostess and was instructed to wait in the bar until the party organizer arrives to approve the setup.  Since this was to be a surprise bday for her boyfriend, we thought this was a bit strange. After clearing things up w the mgr we were promptly escorted into a private dining room next to the wine cellar. The room was arranged beautifully. All the chairs were covered in white seat covers w a gold sash. The dinnerware and glass stemware were arranged perfectly. Our wait person Tiana came in all smile and welcomed all of us.  She gave us a brief overview of the night and proceeded to take our cocktail orders. Everyone enjoyed their cocktail and admired the vast wine collection in the cellar through a floor to ceiling glass wall. Once the guest of honor arrived the party started. We dined on appetizers of Shrimp Cocktail 3 ways, Philly Cheese Egg Rolls, and Crab Cakes.  The menu selection had 3 types of salads, 7 different meats from steak to fish to chicken. Then there are 3 sides and 2 options for dessert.  I Andorra of the attendees had the prime ribeye or filet mignon and they were cooked perfectly. Red center and pink on the outside.  The salmon was cooked medium which is more done then I prefer, but they do ask you for your preference so I would not ding em for that.   However, is ding their salad offerings. When you state your house salad is a mixed green,  you shouldn't be offering iceberg with a few sliver of carrots & croutons. That's and iceberg lettuce salad not mixed greens...it was awful. But it's either that or Cesar Salad or a blue cheese wedge salad. Our drinks were always full and Tiana and the rest of the team were fantastic.  To finish off our dinner, we enjoyed a special birthday cake them Tiana took us inside the wine cellar to admire their collections. Then she showed us the 007 James Bond table which was awesome. You'll have to ask to se that whenever you're there.  We'll definitely be back.",

We were in town celebrating our 2 year anniversary and not only did they give us a very sweet card, but literally every staff member that came to our table told us Happy Anniversary! Our waiter could not have been nicer or more lovely to talk to and even took us on a little tour of the restaurant's wine room after we had finished our meal.   The food at Del Frisco's is insane. I ordered the Crab cakes and they were so delicious! The Cajun sauce they are served on is to die for. My boyfriend had the Porterhouse and it was perfection! We chose the corn and famous lobster mac n cheese for our sides and were extremely happy with both, though we both favored the corn as it had more flavor. A nice surprise slice of their lemon cake was given to us at the end of our meal and while neither of us really even like lemon cake, we devoured it because it was so good!  Yes, this place is a little pricey. You definitely get what you pay for here though because the service and the food are impeccable. Del Frisco's is definitely a must and absolutely worth the splurge!",

Happily, Las Vegas Del Friscos met and exceeded our expectations. We made a 6pm Sunday evening reservation. When we were given our menus, we asked about the $55 Prime Pair Sunday special, which we already knew we wanted to order this because I had researched it. The hostess kind of made a face and said she had to get a different menu for that. This place is really empty on Sunday so its the perfect time to go and have very attentive servers.  The $55 Sunday Prime Pair was a perfect sized portion. The salad, a small 8oz filet, the perfect crab cake and side dish. We did not leave hungry. If you're on a sort of budget but want to go someplace really nice for a good meal-do the Sunday Prime Pair.   I also read about the James Bond Table and if you ask the hostess to see it before you leave, they will gladly open the room and tell you the story and open table for you. If you like Bond, this custom made table is a must see.",

Upon entering, we were immensely overwhelmed by the smell of sewage. After about 10-15 minutes, we got immune to it. Normally, I would give a much lower rating for something like this, but the amazing experience we were given when we were seated deserve for a 4 star.  - As soon as we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our one of two servers. He was amazingly nice and gave us an anniversary card that was signed by the staff. - The drinks were ordered were the best we have had in Vegas and perfectly mixed. - I ordered the filet trio which was so buttery tender. The best filets I've ever eaten. My husband ordered the 16oz filet mignon on the bone. - When our steaks came out, they asked we check to make sure it was to our liking and offered to refire my husband's filet more while keeping my order warm. - We also ordered sides of asparagus and sauteed mushrooms as well as the lobster mac and cheese. About 5 minutes after the sides were delivered, our bus boy came out with another order of the lobster mac. He said he noticed the one originally given to us didn't look creamy enough so he brought us a better one. Glad he did because it amazing! - Our servers consistently checked on us to make sure everything was okay without seeming pushy. - After eating dinner, we were stuffed and decided to order desert to go. When we asked for the desert menu, they came out with a huge lemon cake that had a lit candle and even did a little celebratory happy anniversary song. The lemon cake was amazing and even better later that night as a late munch.  Despite the smell when entering, the experience given to us was amazing. I'd come back again for a special event.",

    "text": "I went to Del Frisco's for 2-person birthday dinner. I ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye, Crab Cake, Sauteed Mushrooms, and Potatoes Au Gratin. Tomahawk Steak - This was enough to split between the two of us. At $90 per steak, it's expensive, and would've been too much for just one person considering the other food we had. However by splitting it, it turned out to be just fine. The steak itself was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. I actually expected more considering it was Wagyu beef and was one of their most popular cuts. I had it ordered medium instead of my usual medium rare preference per other reviewer's recommendations.  I also had their peppercorn sauce which cost a whopping $6 for a small bowl.   Crab Cake - Just like everyone else says, it's incredible. And I don't even care for crab cake. It's not like other crab cakes that are deep fried and mostly breading. This one is mostly crab with a delicious Cajun sauce.  Sauteed mushrooms - Pretty basic, but tons of flavor.  Lots of butter, yum.   Potatoes Au Gratin - Also good, but it was very rich. LOTS of cheese and cream used. I'd probably get something else next time.  They comped us a 5 layer lemon cake at the end. Or was it 7 layers?  We only had a few bites because we were both way too full.   The part that stands out at this restaurant other than the exceptional food is the exceptional service.  The staff obviously is very well trained. They refer to you by name, write a hand-signed birthday card, and overall are extremely attentive. No complaints here.  I highly recommend you try Del Frisco's!",

Crunchy, sweet, tender, and delicious.  The caesar salad was tasty and was a generous portion.  The sesame loaf was served warm with soft salted butter- you'd be amazed how many restaurants get that detail wrong but Del Friscos passed with flying colors!  My filet duo was a daily special and was tasty although a bit chewy.  The lobster mac n cheese was good if you like mild cheese flavour (I am a sharp cheddar girl myself so it wasn't much to my liking but that's a personal preference thing).  Our server was Annamarie, and she was attentive and personal.  They do team service and they were all great.  Annamarie arranged for us to celebrate our occasion (Anniversary weekend) which was a lovely touch.  My husband got the 26oz Double Eagle strip and he ate every bite.    Their lemon cake is amazing.  Huge and very home-made flavor.  We'd definitely return.  Totally worth the short cab ride off the strip and we had no trouble getting another cab back to the hotel after dinner.",

My girlfriend ate the filet mignon and that was so so. From what i read up about I had better.   I tried the sides chateau potatoes were pretty good, but the spinach supreme I wasnt impressed with at all.   Customer service was nice ate least at this place.   It was really overpriced for the steak that I ordered.  And I wasnt to happy that for the price that I paid for my rib-eye it was over cooked badly.   When I am paying 70$ to 90$ per a person for this place and you have over cooked meat of course I am upset! I went  with a group and some of them had really well cooked meat and mine was just over cooked and pretty dry. So I was just upset. Good thing I ate my friends wifes steak because she couldnt finish it. But for my steak that I ordered I wasnt too happy.",

To Frisco's defense the best steak I ever had was a 12oz Buffalo Ribeye....I know, I know. I loved how this place was just off the strip allowing us to truly enjoy the atmosphere and have a nice quiet conversation.   I have to give a nod to our Server. This guy knew more about the menu, specials and drinks than anyone on the planet. This place truly requires their servers to be on top of their games. No stoned waiters here. He walked us through the menu and described everything that was done to the steaks to include the sides. I ended up opting for the Filet Trio and it was epic. The steaks were cooked to perfection as well as the scallops and shrimp that topped my beef. I'm not usually a filet guy but these things were worth the hefty price tag.  Now I know drinks usually come first but somehow this treat slipped my mind. We ordered their house cocktail which has their pineapple infused vodka and an ingredient or two that I can't remember. But this nice and light drink paired well with my heavy, strong flavored filets. If you're looking for classy steak meal without the Strip vibe than this is the place for you.",

Each of those was better than just about any other steak I've ever had.  Service gets high marks, too.

We got our table around 4:55pm and was handed our menus. THE END.   We were the second table to get seated for the night as they start their dinner services. Multiple tables arrived after us and got serviced right away with their servers getting them bread /drinks and taking their orders. Everyone else seemed to be having a great time, so I just kept waiting for our server to show up. We waited and waited and waited, as other servers passed us by and glanced at us, no one bothered to stop and ask. Eventually I just walked to the front desk and told them we've been waiting for 20+ mins as everyone who came after us got serviced. After the complaint, they were quick to getting our orders in and getting our food out, but our appetite has been spoiled. There was no explanation of any kind other than apologizing for the wait.   For a $400 meal, this was not the dining experience I was hoping for. The food is still excellent, but service, not so sure.",

Did I mention when we arrived, there were rose petals scattered on our table with a card signed by the staff, congratulating us on our anniversary. The entire staff and management were super nice and sincere. Make it a point to stop by for your next celebration, you will NOT be disappointed!",

Our sides took longer to come out than the rest of our food and the server was extremely apologetic and even gave us free dessert after our meal because of it. The manager came but and apologized as well, their staff is super nice and the food is delicious!   I'm not sure if I had a special at the time but it was $59 for a salad, I got the wedge and it was so good! The New York steak also really good the crab cakes and a side which I chose creamed spinach and it was all amazing. My family also got Brussels sprouts, lobster Mac and cheese, and potatoes au gratin so I tried everything and loved all of it! Definitely a place I would recommend and go back to",

The multiple verbal acknowledgements, personalized greeting card, and fresh red rose petals sprinkled about the crisp white linen table cloth confirmed the wisdom of our choice of Del Frisco's to mark the occasion.  Compliments to the chef for the well seasoned, juicy Bone in Ribeye cooked perfectly to order. The colossal tower of mouth watering hot Onion Rings proved as delectable as visually delightful. Although the Shrimp appetizer disappointed with its rubbery texture (excessively chilled, perhaps?), the tasty Trio of Sauces accompanying the dish almost made up for it.  We also observed a couple of oddities. The 80's dance music playing in the background didn't jive with the setting. For a Friday night on a holiday weekend, the restaurant's crowd was noticeably sparse. Such a contrast from the lively, near capacity environment we experienced during our last visit several years ago.  Bottom line, Del Frisco's fine dining well worth the $$$.",

    "text": "The reason for my 3-star review is the food. Yes, service was top notch. Yes, the decor is titillating to the eyes. BUT, the food could be so much better! I came here for a business event, so I was able to sit down for an entire 3-course meal. The night started off with a Del's Salad which was not anything special. The salad had an interesting green sauce that was good, but it was too overdressed and I had trouble finishing the saucy greens. Then came the main course of an 8 oz. Filet Mignon with a side of Chateau Mashed Potatoes and green beans. For $45 a steak, it was lacking flavor and the meat did not melt in my mouth like it should. I've been to my fair share of high-end steakhouses (i.e. Mastro's or Ruth's Chris) and this place did not compare. My standards are high if you're charging those kind of prices for steak. The sides were good though! To bring my disappointing dinner to an end, I went with the cheesecake dessert with strawberries. Sad to say, that was also quite unsatisfying. The texture and taste of the cheesecake was unfulfilling, lacking the creaminess that one would expect when eating that dessert. The crust was it's saving grace. Overall, I had an okay experience. With all the positive reviews people leave about this place, I might assume that my bad experience was a result of a set dinner menu and lack of attention to the food made in bulk for a big party of about 20 people.",

We had to sit at the bar because my mom wore a hat,  no big deal, actually ended up being a great experiance! Meeting Gavin And Trish was a pleasure,  very knowledgeable about drinks and menu. We started with a makers 46 old fashioned,  martini and  a rose cocktail,  followed by sharing a wedge salad, with 3 rib eyes, house del potatoes,  and corn with shishito  peppers. For dessert they recommend the butter cake? Omg to die for.. I've never been one to sit at the bar for a gourmet dinner? But the these two made the whole experience a dinner to remember and I would highly recommended this place to locals and anyone looking for a unique dining experience!",

I had been wishing to try this place out and I am so glad I chose a special occasion to finally try it out! I tried out Del Frisco's during restaurant week and got a huge and delicious meal for a great price! I tried the fillet mignon with mash potatoes and I can say it is the best steak I have ever had. I also had the Caesar salad and cheesecake and they were also very delicious. I took the time to write this review not so much to rave about the food, but to rave about the impeccable customer service Del Frisco's offered my family and I. I have to say this was the best service experience I have ever had from the time I walked in, to the minute I left. Every staff member my family and I came in contact with made us feel extremely welcome like they truly take pride and enjoy what they do. I want to thank our 3 servers, 4 hostess, restaurant manager, valet attendant and everyone else for taking the time to make our first visit as enjoyable as it was!",

    "text": "Wait, isn't that Bond music playing in the background?  Maybe this restaurant is themed after those very alluring signature Bond scenes that involve classy lounges and beautiful people, I thought. Little did I know that Del Frisco's is known for their \"Bond table\" until today when I read a couple reviews. So if you pay a visit, be sure to ask to see the James Bond Wine Table!  We got to sample a good variety of menu items as we visited during LV Restaurant Week. I think we would have enjoyed the food if the chef didn't go salt-happy on most of our dishes. Thought it was just me, but everyone at the table seemed to agree that the food was overly salty to the taste.   My favorite dishes of the night include: Shanghai-Style Fried Calamari ($18) Prime Ribeye ($49.5) with mushroom sauce (extra $) Lobster Macaroni and Cheese ($18.5) Warm Banana Bread Pudding ($10)  Everything else... The Lobster Bisque ($14), Sauteed Wild Mushrooms ($14), and Prime Ribeye without the sauce were too salty to be enjoyable. What a shame.  On the brighter side, A+ for the service we received that night. It certainly did not go unnoticed. We were told to cut our steaks once received to make sure it was cooked exactly to our liking and the water refills were constant. Terrific!   If I were to pay another visit, I would definitely request to order everything with light salt.",

    "text": "My first upscale steakhouse chain dinner in Vegas was a 4-star review. This one was not as good.  I went to Del Frisco's for a private group dinner this week, covered fully by the host. I was anticipating a great dinner and primed to compare it fully with Fleming's, where I'd had a similar complimentary-for-guests meal.  Service here was certainly great, with constant water refills and timely plate changes and utensil removal. Judging from web site descriptions of private dining options, we got the Sports Room; the three television sets were reasonable for our purposes, albeit a little on the small side. Light and background music control were present.  As for food, I wasn't as fully impressed. It appears that we got a slightly adjusted Dinner Menu One, priced at $79 per person (similar to the listed price of my other meal, but with considerably fewer appetizers).  Complimentary bread and butter: fluffy bread coated with sesame seeds and fluffy butter. Pretty standard stuff.  Del's Salad: the only option for the first course. All the veggies were fresh and crisp, and the creamy dressing was addictive. The bacon was delicious, although not very crispy. It required considerable effort with the butter knife to cut it apart. I would've also appreciated more croutons on the plate, not just two modestly sized cubes.  8 oz. Filet Mignon: my choice, rather than the Roasted Chicken Breast or Salmon with Lobster Tomato Jus. I was instructed to cut it in half upon its presentation (on a very hot plate) to ensure proper doneness, and it was a very pink medium-rare. Tenderness was evident, as expected. However, the flavor just wasn't there. Whether it's a lack of seasoning on the crust or a less-than-stellar aging process, I was let down by my steak.  Green Beans and Chateau Potatoes: two side dishes, both served onto my steak plate upon my verbal confirmation and then left in the middle of the table. I loved the crunchy, buttery green beans but could've used a touch more salt and a lot more flavor in the potatoes. They were a mix of huge potato chunks and some mashed parts, which was fine, but I didn't find myself wanting to clean off that plate.  Chocolate Mousse: chose this for dessert rather than the Cheesecake with Strawberries. I'd been disappointed recently with various chocolate mousse desserts around town, but this was delicious and dark enough all the way through. Texture was consistently smooth as well. The raspberries were fresh but overpowering, so I opted to devour them quickly before enjoying the chocolate alone.  The red wine was okay. I overheard that it was a Malbec, but I wasn't intrigued enough to look into it further. They also aren't generous with the refills, which is probably best for the safety of all parties involved.  I would've given Del Frisco's 3.5 stars based on this meal, but I don't have the option of half stars and I certainly can't give it equal footing with my other recent steakhouse dinner. Maybe I'll come back in the future to try some other menu items, but I won't be in a hurry.",

One crab cake per two people was the perfect amount. That fresh lump crab meat and very little filler is what sets these babies above all other crab cakes.  The sauce with a touch of heat doesn't hurt either. Try dipping your bread in it.  My husband and I shared a wedge salad which they were able to split in the kitchen. I was not a fan of the bleu cheese dressing, which had a slightly sweet flavor.  Our friends shared the burrata and heirloom tomato salad. We didn't get a bite so I think they loved it!  For our main courses, we shared a dry aged ribeye and a bone in tomahawk cooked rare plus. These steaks were incredible. Melt in your mouth and so flavorful.  Sides were Brussels sprouts and chateau potatoes. The Brussels sprouts were good. The chateau potatoes were way too heavy on the truffle butter for my taste.  Full disclosure, I'm not generally a fan of truffle anything but chocolate. Just too rich for my tastebuds.   After all that and several bottles of Nickel & Nickel, we still managed to split a butter cake. This dessert was the right amount of sugary crust and paired perfectly with Butter Pecan ice cream.  Lest I forget, Zane & Lauren provided top notch service.  All things considered, we had a great meal and you just can't beat the cigar club ambiance of this place.",

A recommended would be serve ICE COLD, keep the bacon  smaller & served across rim to rim on top of glass, not touching the actual cocktail.    My husband's Kettle 1 Martini , also served barely chilled, a wasted opportunity on both counts.     We should have returned them ~ I believe a restaurant of DF quality should get these things the FIRST time. HENCE 4 STARS",

The steaks are just the best. Our friend took us to Del friscos in NY which is the busiest one, and my wife and I loved it from beginning to end. The prices are like normal steak house prices, but it's a little cheaper. We brought our son who was about 2 years old, and everyone was professional from the server to the manager. My son gets a little fussy and loud sometimes, but the manger came by and entertained him for a little while, which I thought was really nice. After we reached home, the GM wrote a thank you card which I thought was a really nice touch. We always go back every time we're in Vegas. Two thumbs up!!!",

Tasted like fresh pineapples. Me and my friend shared the bone in rib eye. I thought it was a bit too fatty, but it was very tender and juicy. We also got the truffle and fois gras butter in the side to try. The truffle butter is sensational. Definitely try it. There is another mushroom butter the server recommended that I would like to try next time.   We also ordered lots of appetizer. The best has to be the crab cakes. It was filled with chunks of crabs, hardly any fillers. The tuna tartar was okay, but the crunchy bread that went along with it goes very well with it. The Shanghai calamari was a bit too sweet for my tasting.   Another friend ordered the jumbo crabs and it was very fresh, but nothing out of the ordinary.   We also ordered the lemon cake to share with coffee. It was a huge piece. Even for four people we took half of it back with us. It is supposedly made freshly from scratch.",

On top of everything it took over 2 hours to receive my dinner. Uncalled for definitely not appreciated! I took my fiance there because I am so used to the AMAZING service and quality of food of Del Frisco's in Manhattan (which will definitely exceed your expectations)! The manager tried to make the situation better by taking a few things off the bill and giving us dessert, but by that time the damage was done. The waiter/waitress team we had was VERY weak. Lacked the desire to earn your business the next time you were in need for an unforgettable dinner. Food wasn't the greatest by any means , the only good thing I had I would say is the calamari, lobster Mac n cheese (which is normally to die for) were too runny and the cream corn was absolutely terrible. My steak was trash and it was $125(The Double Eagle dry aged double bone prime ribeye ) . All in all very disappointed with the experience and hope they get back on track and represent that name to the STANDARD THAT IT REPRESENTS!",

I'm sorry for starting at the end of the meal, but that was one of the best desserts I've ever had! It was like sex on a plate. I'm not even a big banana fan (hee hee), but I love bread pudding, so I thought I'd give it a shot. WOW! It was amazing, like banana bread and bread pudding went out on a few dates and decided to have a baby. And the ice cream paired with it- omg.. I may return and just order dessert!  Ok, let's get to the meat of the review (see what I did there?). Dining with the self proclaimed \"King of DelFrisco (DC)\", was mildly amusing, because many of the servers came to speak with him and compare restaurant locations. I started with the VIP cocktail, which was perfect. Pineapple taste, but not overwhelmingly sweet, very smooth, really lovely. We got the shrimp cocktail (with all the sauces), and the crab cake for appetizers. I enjoyed them both, the crab cake was light, very little filler, but could have used a touch more seasoning. I still ate almost all of it, though!   I ordered the prime ribeye as my entree, medium rare. This was one of the first times I wished I had ordered it medium. It was just a smidge under for my taste. To be fair to DelFrisco, the server did ask me to cut it in the middle to see if it was prepared to my liking. I just didn't want to be rude and send it back. It was seasoned really well and had great flavor, but a couple more seconds on the flame would have been perfect for me.  We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese for our side dish, and it was very creamy, cheesy, with some lobster chunks, although not a lot. Like the crab cake, I did think it could have used more seasoning, though.   Btw, the bread was soft and warm, and the server gave us a fresh loaf when she boxed our leftovers. Speaking of service, it was attentive and friendly throughout. We had a few people waiting on our table, and the manager came by to check on us as well.  Of course, DelFriscos isn't a cheap meal, so do prepare to spend. I believe that our meal, which included 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 1 side dish, and 1 dessert, was about $230. Pricey, but well worth it!",

My husband had the 12oz. fillet with peppercorn sauce. Perfectly cooked and he loved the sauce. Best steak he has ever had. We shared Chateau potatoes and asparagus. Both were excellent. Even though we were completely full, we ate the chocolate souffle and cake with ice cream. The manager, David and Executive Chef Fernando both came to our table to wish us a happy anniversary.

    "text": "Wow, what a disaster!  Been a regular at Del Frisco's since my first 2002 visit to the Manhattan location, on a scale of 1-10 ... its always a 10!  The Las Vegas location always scored an 8-9 in my book, while Denver come's in at 7-8, my last visit to Denver pushed into the 8+ territory.  However something is going seriously sideways at the Vegas location, first of all I didn't recognize a single person. Next observation was empty tables on a CES weekend ... never a good sign!  We were seated and greeted by some sort of team effort wait staff, wow, who's stupid idea was this. My King Crab arrived 10 minutes after the steaks, served stone cold with unsalted, unheated butter.  We witnessed 3 waiters taking food orders at one table while the rest of the room went unattended.  It took 5 minutes just to flag down a bus boy, no eye contact, nobody paying attention.   An unapologetic manager arrived 10 minutes later offering to make things right. By then I had already finished eating half of my wife's bone dry medium-rare steak and the horrible tasting cream corn and potatoes. We would have left right then and there but it took another 10 minutes just to flag a waiter for our check.  With all this down time we had a chance to look around at the other tables. Not one steak had any juice on the bottom of the plate, none of the side dishes had that perfect Del Frisco presentation. To the uninitiated everything may appear OK, however as a long time Del Fisconeer it's a serious disappointment. A free so-so tasting lemon cake did little to take the edge of the experience, I just wanted out of there ...  I don't know what to think ... I'm not looking for a free meal ... or corporate apology.   I just want my Vegas Del Frisco's back.",

My husband and I had only been here once before and loved it, so of course, when we came back into town this restaurant was at the top of our list to come back to.  This time I ordered the lamb chops (I was sooo sick of chicken).  I had never had lamb chops before but I can now say, I am a huge fan.  They had such great flavor and the dipping sauce was phenomenal.  I ordered the chateau potatoes with my meal and they were awesome as well.  I couldn't change a thing!!  Here's where the problem comes in.  My husband ordered the roasted chicken.  And although the chicken tasted good, the order underneath it was gross.  I asked him why he wasn't eating it and he told me it wasn't good.  I actually didn't believe him until I tasted it for myself.  YUK!!  It was hard and a little crunchy.  He also ordered the lobster mac & cheese.  It was very good but when we got back to our room we realized that the server who boxed our food for us (you don't do it yourself here) didn't put it in our back of left over items.  BOO!!!  We had over half an order left.  The lemon cake here is exceptional.  Glad that didn't change.    We'll probably come back next time, just wont get the chicken again and will make sure all of our items are in the bag before leaving.",

If I had more gastric space, I would've tried everything.  Everyone ordered some form of steak, from rib eye, filet, to double eagle.  Being worse for wear and not sure I'd be able to take down a steak, I was the schmuck that ordered the chicken. Even that took me down. It was succulent!  Standouts were: Main courses (of course), crab cakes, calamari (DO IT!), onion rings (huge), asparagus, and mushrooms.. Ordered a wedge and it was good too. I might get a different salad next time. Also, the bread was so soft and warm. I'm a sucker for loading up on bread and butter.  Overall, great time here and a good choice if you want to escape the strip for a good meal with great lighting. There was a bit of a strange smell in the reception area, kind of sewery/weird plumbing smell. As stated above, the servers seemed to come out of nowhere and were on top of everything from the get go. They even presented a gigantic slice of lemon cake for our friend's bday. So massive that about half of it was left over after we passed it around the table. I look forward to dining here again.",

    "text": "I'll be as direct as possible. I've been going to Las Vegas for 30+ years and I have had a lot of great meals. With Vegas, you have some of the great chefs cooking some really out of the box types of foods that are interesting and creative. This is not a restaurant like that, this is in my opinion, is the great American steakhouse experience. From the moment we walked in we were immediately greeted, brought to our table and had a waiter (Taylor) that made this an over the top experience, as he was extremely attentive, very knowledgeable and had a super personality. Our lobster tail, crab cake, lettuce wedge salad, New York steak & lemon cake experience was a 10+ plus plus! I am a fan forever, Del Frisco's  is now my number one restaurant of choice where ever I go! Thank you for a mind blowing meal.",

I had an Old Fashioned and my buddy had a Manhattan.  They were spot on.  We ordered several appetizers to include the crab cakes and carpaccio.  The crab cake is pretty much 4oz of lump crab drizzled with a cajun sauce. It's delicious.  Same goes for the carpaccio.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye.  My waitress convinced me to have it done on the more medium side, as opposed to the med rare that I typically do.  She said it would give the fat in the steak an opportunity to liquify a little more.  It showed up and was frankly not what I wanted.  It was just too done.  However, before I could even get to into it the staff whisked the steak away and said that it would be done to my 100% satisfaction.  I apologized for being that guy.  They were awesome about it.  They kept saying that perfection is their goal.  Our waitress even told the chef it was her fault.  They go out of their way to make you feel satisfied.    I would highly recommend go to Del Frisco's.  Although they are in the $$$$ category you get your money's worth.",

It's a little louder of an atmosphere than other steakhouses I've been to.  Overall the quality is great, but if there's anything that stands out at this place over all the other items they offered at this steakhouse, its one thing.   The ONION RINGS!  OMG, I have never had onion rings as good as the ones I've had here.  I even had some leftover and ate it the next morning as breakfast and they were still awesome.  I don't know why no one can make onion rings like this anywhere else, but I'd say it's worth the $10 or more they charge for them.  I've never had such a chewy delicious oniony ring before!  I think if it were possible, I'd just drop by and order a side of onion rings as a snack if that were proper because they were THAT GOOD!   Again everything else was great, but the onion rings really wowed me!",

The main host and waitress was very attentive and does not bug you like others in other restaurants. She actually has assistants which I find it surprising that they do not make eye contact with your. I guess the logic is that all your concerns must be addressed to the main waitress.   They ask if you need to go anywhere after dinner so they may prioritize your meal on the line. Don't expect fancy presentation, this is a steak house! But they serve your sides and do not leave the extra plates on the table. Bring your plate meat plate out and have you cut it in front of them so you may investigate the cut and wellness of the cooking. I had the rack of lamb and Loved it!   As we were eating, a piece of crumb was on the table and a waiter assistant stopped, took out a tiny hand spatula and scooped it out and off he left. Didn't make eye contact with anyone of us. I was like, \"Woah.... did you see that!\" Hahahaha  We were here for 2 birthday boys (I was one) and at the end, our waitress brought out these 2 awesome cuts of lemon cake and chocolate fudge. They were HUGE!!!! Enough for the whole table to enjoy. When she brought it out she said happy bday, but we don't sing. LOL cool, I don't like waiters singing anyways. The best part was at the end of the service, they did not add gratuity on the bill and we are a party of 6. Thats RESPECT!!!!! Worth the $400 bill! Thats with the cakes comped too.  BTW, I just wanted to add that when we left I wanted to use the bathroom. One of the waiter assistants said, right this way sir. As she was leading me to the bathroom, she bent the corner and another assistant came out that same corner and said, \"This way sir\" and carried on to lead me to the bathroom. WOW!!!! AWESOME!!! It was like a lateral pass. They didn't tell me where the bathroom was, they led me the way.   No cocky waiters/waitresses, no mishaps, no fancy..... Just class and a great experience. I will be glad to come back here again when I visit vegas soon. Just bring a heavy pocket with a big appetite.",

    "text": "Planned the hubster's 40th birthday here - he loves steaks and hanging w/ friends - and this seem to be the best place to fit the bill.    Given some other group dinners we've had where the noise threshold made it difficult to chat and catch up with friends - I wanted to make sure we had a private room.     Del Frisco's has  private rooms availabe if you have over a certain number of folks, but then you need to use the preset dinner options.  They had set up the room so everyone was facing each other which was a nice touch.    We chose the $95 option preset menu which had enough steak options to satisfy this meat eating crowd as well as a salmon and chicken option that worked for others.   It is a lot of food with an appetizer, salad, main course w/ sides, and dessert - although the sides seemed a bit stingy (a tablespoon dollop of potatoes is not what I would consider a side).   A bonus was the perfect bacon slices that top your salad (if you get the house salad) and the amazing croutons that they make every day.    Everyone enjoyed their meal and the wait staff were so sweet and considerate, even bringing out a pen so everyone could sign the large wine bottle we got.  They were always a step ahead.   Making the reservation I was a bit worried as this part was not as friendly, but in the end with the welcoming manner of the wait staff, the intimacy of having your own room (we had 22 folks), and the good food, I was glad we chose Del Frisco's.",

Let me start off by saying I had Del Frisco's 3 times in NYC and it was amazing so while we're in town, I suggested we try Del Frisco's.   The service was excellent but the steak was a big disappointment.  I ordered the bone-in filet and my husband had the double-eagle.  Both wanted medium rare..The first time they brought our steak out, it was medium well so we sent it back. Second time around was even worse...mine was still cold in the middle and my husband was so rare he could barely chew!  They were $70 per steak but by the time the second steak was brought out, we were tired and starving so decided to just eat what we could and left.  Conclusion: I will never return here. Being that they are a steakhouse, they should know what medium rare is vs. medium well or rare.",

    "text": "*update - ok so I wrote this on my stupid kindle and I had complaints it wasn't that wordy.  If you type on a tablet you would understand.  And In all honesty the experience at Del Frisco's wasn't remarkable enough for me to write anything thorough, I just didn't like it that much.  I'll try to be more specific.  In short - really super super expensive on par with prices on the strip, but not really worth the price.  Many other steakhouses in town are just as expensive and are much better.  The quality of the meat and the flavor was good on the steaks that rely on aging, in this case we got the bone in ribeye and ny strip.  I prefer steaks that are cooked with a heavy crust and char on it, and I was disappointed, there was very little of that here.  Additionally, when you order medium rare, they cook it blue.  If you like your meat that raw, you will be happy, but it was too much for me.  I told them it was too raw for me and they just threw it on the fire, and it came out too well done, and much of the flavor disappeared, as it usually does when you recook meat.  We ordered a few sides, some asparagus (which was ok), and a corn dish that my husband liked but I thought was very flavorless.  It had tasso ham in it which didn't seem to help the taste of it.  The corn itself was not sweet (since corn isn't in season I expected this), but why serve a dish that doesn't benefit from being in the right season and delicious?  To make up not being real keen on the steak, they comped us lemon cake.  However, I don't really eat sugar that much.  While I appreciated it, I wish they could have asked first.  But taking a taste of it, this became he winner dish of the night.  If you have a sweet tooth and love cake, or lemon cake, it would be worth the trip to only get that dessert.  It was phenomenal.",

To start we ordered the crab cake & the calamari. Something about how both were fried created this shell of crispy, golden, goodness... plate scrapingly good. The calamari was drizzled in some sort of spicy sauce that I could only hope was bottled somewhere that I could buy cases of.  Entrees  were shared among us and boy were we glad to do so... we challenged the Tomahawk & largest Lobster tail they offered. Those two entrees w/ the appetizers were enough for 4 people! Our goal was to eat and be comfortable w/out having leftovers. Mission accomplished except for the fact that we were stuffed! Stick a fork in me cause I surrender! I'm a fan for life.

The ironic thing is Ruth Chris is right across the street from Del Frisco in Vegas.  I wonder how they stay in business when Del Frisco is sucking up all the business.  Must be a vegetarian Ruth Chris or something.    The ambiance of the place is great.  There is live music and the lighting is not too bright and not too dark, just perfect.  I can see what I am eating.  The service is was top notch.  Our server was professional, knowledgeable about every item on the menu, and very attentive.  The food will have you rolling your eyes back.  It's that good.    You start off with freshly baked bread.  The crab cake pairs really well with the cajun sauce.  Don't miss out on the crab cakes, you will regret it.  I had the Ribeye and it is the best Ribeye steak I ever have had.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked to the right temperature.  The sides I had with my steak was potatoes au grouton, mushrooms, and mac and cheese.  The best side dish is the potatoes au grouton.  It is THE ultimate man side dish.  It is potato squares with cheese and bacon.  Nothing healthy about this dish, just pure goodness.  If you are a guy, you have to order this dish.  If not, just send me your man card.  Unfortunately I did not try out any desserts because I was stuffed to the max.  I will make sure to try out one of the desserts on my next visit (hopefully soon).  The bill will be over $100 easy.  It is expected when dining in a good steakhouse.    In the end, I wish I can give Del Frisco 6 stars!  Matter of fact, here you go Del Frisco's,  *.  This place knows how to make steak.  If God came down and asked you to recommend a good steak place, you better recommend Del Frisco's or you are going to hell because you are doing God dirty if you recommend any other place.  Bon Appetit everyone!",

I ordered the 22 oz bone-in prime ribeye.  Now, for those of you who know your customary units, 16 oz is a pound, so this is more than a pound of beef.  It's a huge serving, but it's sooo good!  It's perfectly seasoned and cooked right. I asked for medium, which was pink, but no blood, the way I like it.    Since it's such a huge serving, I thought I would eat half and save the other half for tomorrow's dinner.  Well, so much for that idea.  Now, I'm not sure if I should brag about this, but I'm 5'5\" and 110 pounds, so a 22 oz steak would be a lot, but I ate it all in one sitting, because it was THAT good.

When we arrived , we were seated at a table by the bar.  The furnishings are typical for a grand steakhouse.....dark woods with white tablecloths.  Tonight Del Frisco entertained their guests with a pianist who played and sang soft rock music throughout the meal.......awesome!  We started the meal with their fried calamari and their wonderful, oven-baked warm bread.   The calamari was prepared \"Shanghai\" style with a sweet, red pepper, tangy sauce....totally awesome flavor.  For dinner, we had the bone-in rib eye steaks and sides of creamed spinach with bacon, lobster macaroni and cheese and skillet potatoes and onions.  The steak was perfectly prepared and cooked.......full of flavor and just the right amount of marbling.  The sides were outstanding......the spinach and lobster mac and cheese were excellent.  The skillet potatoes were thick chips.......and the onions were cut equally as thick.......they went perfectly with the steak flavor.  For dessert, we had the 7 layered lemon cake.....one of the best deserts I have ever had!  It was sweet...tangy and so fucking--good!  Overall....one of my best steak meals ever!",

The night before, we devoured the Beef Bowl Cut (25oz) bone in prime rib from Lawry's Prime Rib and we wanted to continue the good eats tour.  We ordered:  16oz Bone in Filet Mignon ($65) - Probably the most tender piece of meat I have ever eaten... Cooked medium rare, this behemoth was flavorful and practically melted in my mouth. I would definitely order this again!  32oz Tamohawk Bone in Ribeye ($90) - Prepared medium rare as well... This is from a Wagyu Steer and it was perfectly marbled. The meat was tender and robust with flavor. I also loved this choice! Definitely a repeat order.  Crab Cakes in lobster sauce ($17) - I've never had some much crab in my crab cakes! The lobster sauce was a hit as well. Our waiter suggested that we dip our bread in the sauce and boy did we...! I would order this again.   Potatoes Au Gratin - Large chunks of bacon, plenty of cheesy goodness over potatoes. A winner!  Supreme Creamed Spinach - Finally a creamed spinach that taste more like spinach that the cream. It was delightfully delicious and the perfect compliment to any meat.  Lemon Doberge Cake ($10) - The most sinfully delicious lemon cake you will ever have. The cake is light and fluffy and the lemon cream is light and refreshing. I went with a friend who hates desserts and much as he hates dancing. We were at a best friends wedding and she asked him to dance which he declined. How do you decline a dance requested by the bride whom you known for 10+ years? That's how much he hates dancing... And thats how much he hates desserts. After reading that, he polished off a whole slice of lemon cake by himself. Now thats a pretty damn good slice of lemon cake!  Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas looking for a steak... let alone a good meal. Although it was on the pricey side, it was worth every penny. I cant sing enough praise for this place!!  Look at my pictures!!",

My friends introduce me to restaurant week and I came along for the ride when they decided to go to this steak house.  I remember we had reservations and it was about 20minutes till we got seated, but I didnt mind it because they we were at a bar and enjoying some drinks.    Once we got seated we were served right away and started ordering our food.  I ordered the filet mignon and mashed potatoes.  & my oh my it was just EXQUISITE. The taste of the mignon was extravagant and you can basically cut the steak with your fork, (dont need a steak knife).  It came with a crab cake on the side and it was my very first taste of what a carb cake was & it made me just love eating it over & over & over again. I had mashed potatoes, too it was pretty awesome but I felt like it could have been better! But the filet and the crab cake just blew me away.  I will definitely be back again.",

Come here for the crab cakes to start ( it's like they took the crab and rolled it into a ball, cooked it and served it, that's how much crab is in it ).  Then the tomahawk wagyu steak.  Very good but definitely not any where close to Japanese wagyu.  I would say more AAA Prime.  So in that regards, not a perfect 5 stars. Food - Steaks...don't come here and order fish, it's not Del Frisco's Double Eagle Fish House Wine Selection - excellent.  If you can't find a varietal and vineyard you like here, then congratulations you're a billionaire.  Atmosphere - more classic than hip on the strip.

Good job Toryn! (not sure how her name is spelled, sorry). My husband and I visited last night May 29th and the experience was like what we had in April 2014.  They won us back starting with the service from Benny, he was clear in his communication, offered good suggestions, was attentive, personable and really good job.  The food was spot on this time, my 8 oz fillet was not overly seasoned and cooked at the right temperature as requested.  The fillet melted like butter.  The cream corn side was awesome and not overly heavy.  My husband had the baked potatoe and we both had Del's salad to start.  The VIP was freshing and loved the infused pineapple taste. This is what a great dining experience should be like.  We felt like it was our first experience and are fans once again.",

I had no reservation and the place was quite busy but the patio was empty, so the patio it was. The server was really cool and had many Vegas hot spot suggestions. They served the usual bread and butter, bread tasted fresh and butter was whipped and easy to spread.   Starter: Bleu Cheese Lettuce Wedge = Nicely portioned, Lettuce chopped finely, Bleu Cheese Dressing was one of the best I ever had and the jumbo croutons added the right texture.  Entree: Bone-In Ribeye (cooked Medium Well). Chef actually came out to serve this and asked to cut the steak in half to make sure it was cooked to par. Steak came on a hot plate and had a different aroma to it. This place heavily seasons their steaks. When Slicing the meat I noticed it had a tender falling apart feel to it. After my first bite, I took a few more.. It really had a distinctive flavor that overpowered the natural steak flavor that I'm used to at a Steak House. However, it was delicious and unusual the same time. I personally like my steaks to taste like the natural traditional steaks (Let the natural flavors of the meat do its job).   Sides: Lobster Macaroni & Cheese = 3.5/5              Maque Choux Corn = 3/5              Onion Rings = 2/5   Service was great, the bleu cheese salad got me salivating thinking about it and the steak worth a try",

You could cut the filet mignon with a butter knife. The service was excellent - the servers knew when to give us privacy and when we needed service.

My colleague and I both started with the special salad of the night and it was excellent! A chopped salad with a creamy basil dressing. With the bread it could have been a meal in itself.    For dinner I had the crab cakes which I was told was their most popular item. They were also excellent, two large mounds of crab with just enough filler to hold them together served with a spicy sauce. My colleague had the filet and it was good but not as tender as one would expect.  For dessert I had the banana bread pudding and it was very good. Big enough to share. More cake-like than a traditional bread pudding.  Like all high end Vegas steak houses this place is expensive, maybe a bit too expensive. In this price range you can do a bit better even in Vegas. So overall I give it four stars.",

I sat at the bar and had a lemon drop where the simple syrup used was way too sweet.  The Caesar salad was good (but did have a leaf with the red stuff in it) and the steak tips, because I was traveling and couldn't eat a whole steak.  I thought this would be a good way to taste the \"exceptional\" food this restaurant had to offer.  I was wrong.  I know it was a low end dish, but each steak tip almost broke my teeth because they were only grissel (sp?).  In fact, there was bone in one of them.  I wasn't asked how my meal was until after I was done.  For my second drink I asked for less lemon and that didn't  happen.  The reason I'm giving two stars is that it was fun to watch the bartender at work.  There are so many other choices in Vegas--when I come back I will go somewhere else.",

I wanted to try it because I had just won some money playing craps that night and decided what the heck I'll treat myself out to a nice dinner. I ordered the ribeye like I normally do at every other steakhouse I go to. When they bring out the steak they tell you to cut through the middle to make sure it is perfectly cooked. Once I took my first bite, I knew why it was so highly rated on yelp. The steak was very juicy and tender and had a peppery seasoning which kept its flavor till the very last bite. This was accompanied by a lobster mac and cheese which really evened the whole meal out. It was very creamy and flavorful and they topped it with a crust that really gave it a nice texture. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and would put it in my top 3 best steaks I've had",

The crab cake appetizers were baked, not fried... and you can actually REALLY taste the crab, unlike most other crab cakes. It was almost made of just pure crab flakes (huge pieces actually)... and it comes with a sauce that is to die for!  The prime rib was cooked and seasoned perfectly... oh so good, I'm drooling right now as I write this review. Came on a hot plate. All of their sides were so delicious, I don't even know where to begin to describe them. Even the bread was delicious (unlike other breads... this is extra good!).

Del Frisco's is one of those restaurants that makes me happy to be a grown-up. We usually start off with the calamari which has a spicy kick. The True star of their menu is the steak; it truly melts in your mouth, it's like a piece of buttery goodness like nothing else I've had in my life. All of the sides that we have tried have been good, but I would highly recommend the sauteed mushrooms.  I would even venture out to say that I wouldn't mind eating those damn mushrooms instead of their steaks and calling it a meal, but that's crazy talk. Order both and give your dining companion the evil eye so that he wont feel comfortable touching your food, and call it a day.",

It's a pre-fixe meal for two that includes a salad, 8 oz filet mignon, crab cake, a choice of side (I highly recommend the spinach), and dessert. Suffice to say, we were stuffed to the gills by the end of the meal.   Price - excellent!  Hurry, the special ends on Labor Day.   Taste - the steak was incredible; the crab cakes were moist and replete with jumbo lump crab, no fillers; the Del's salad was made more extraordinary because of the two full thick-cut strips of crunchy bacon.    Service - In spite of the initial snafu where our server was nowhere to be seen for the first 15 minutes, we were rescued by the friendly and efficient Alana. She profusely apologized for the confusion, took our orders immediately, and continued to check in on us no less than 5 times during the meal. We were served by about 6 different people throughout the night, from the manager folding the hubby's napkin when he got up to go to the bathroom to refilling my Coke without being asked. The manager was even there to ask us if our steaks were cooked just the way we wanted it, as it was being served to us. Furthermore, since we told them it was our anniversary, we were greeted by everyone \"Happy Anniversary\" at least 8 times, and our drinks were comped too. Thanks to Alana and the wonderful staff of Delfrisco's for a night to remember!",

    "text": "First of all I'll start by saying this place is top notch. Its definitely a Prime steak house (Not like places that front like they are). Second I cannot agree with people saying this place is Waaayyyy better then Ruth's Chris, I could see people thinking its better, but not by a lot.  Pros: Ridiculous cuts of meat, The table bread was awesome, wine selection is excellent, fast and a tentative service, Lobster mash (I don't eat lobster but the whole table loved it)  Cons: Our server offered us the Awagyu ribeye special for 2, which 4 of us ordered, then later they told us they were out of that cut of meat (Not pleased about that) . My steak was a little over cooked, so make sure you speak up if its not to your liking (I was really hungry and it was late, so I let it slide because the cut was sooo good). Not much else.  In Conclusion this place is worth every penny and deserves all the praises it receives. Ask for a semi private or private room if you have a good size group, they don't charge extra for it.",

    "text": "Too few places in Vegas like this.  Disclosure: I have boycotted this place for years because they don't allow corkage.  However, a couple friends dragged me here for a celebration and I was kicking and screaming the whole way there.  Once there, I tried to get over my personal feelings and enjoy the night.    I'm glad I did.  The service was excellent.  I swear there there about 3 people waiting on us, the manager came by a couple times and the sommelier was very chatty with us, as well.    We ordered two appetizers: crab cakes (good, full of crab with very little filler - the way it should be) and oysters rockefeller (I prefer raw oysters, but this was pretty good).    The wine list was deep, which is probably why they don't allow for corkage, but it was pretty pricey, even compared to some strip restaurants.  However, I dug in and found some two bottles of wine that were maybe 50% over retail.    For our entrees, we shared two steaks: a bone-in filet and a bone-in rib eye.  Both were med-rare, of course, and cooked to perfection.  I really don't like filet, in general, because it usually has very little beef flavor, but this cut was actually pretty tasty.  The rib eye was good, on par with the best I've had.  Meaty, tender and bloody - just the way I like it.  For sides, we definitely over-ordered with mashed sweet potatoes (very good), mac and cheese (meh), creamed spinach (among the best) and potatoes au gratin (nothing special).    For desert, we had the lemon cake (fantastic!!!) and the chocolate cake (pretty good).  The portions of everything were good sized, especially the sides.  We were stuffed.  The food was memorable and the service was spectacular.  It almost felt like it was neighborhood restaurant, as opposed to something so close to the strip and packed with tourists.",

I also tasted my husbands shrimp scampi, it was a little to oily for me but the shrimp was good. For dessert the lemon cake was delicious I never thought I would like it but it totally \"wow\"ed me.

Atmosphere is great for dates, business outings or group dinners, and they always have something special to show you at the end of the night, here they had the James Bond table, which was very cool!

The bartenders were quite attentive and talkative. Great times at the bar.   The hostess found us at the bar and escorted us to our seats. Our waiter was great and made our time at Del Frisco's fun. Thanks Joey. From your input on the food, wine, and history of the restaurant we had the best time.  The food was amazing. We had ordered the crab cakes, double eagle prime, spinach, and mac n cheese. If you order the crab cakes, I would recommend that you order your own. You probably won't want to share. The double eagle prime was cooked to perfection. I love ordering a medium rare and having it just melt in your mouth. This did just that. The meat was so flavorful and tender. The sides that we ordered were good too but not something I absolutely have to have. I would be content with just the crab cake and steak.  Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "I visited Vegas for a tradeshow and was taken to dinner at Del Frisco's. I had never heard of it except the reviews from my peers that it was \"the best steak ever.\"  We had a large party (8) and so we had reservations but had to wait for a table. The place is busy and standing room only in the bar. I had a lemon drop and it was above par.  We finally were seated in the corner and had a semi-private table. The one interesting thing that stood out from 'high-end' steakhouses to Del Frisco's is that we had 2 waiters who constantly stood by us.  They dished us our sides and were always there to assist with additional beverages or any issues we had. I've been to other 'high-end' steakhouses where the waiter is hands-on before your meal but then not present until after. I appreciated the extra touch.  The steak's were quite large and I had the sirloin. I had the 8-oz and was barely able to finish it as it was a thick cut as well as the large portions of the sides.  After we arrived back to our offices, we received a personal thank you card from Del Frisco's hand-written thanking us for visiting and to come back when in town.  Loved the service, quality of food and the personal touches. I didn't end up feeling like another 'customer' who passed through. Definitely going to spend $100/pp for a meal but a nice place to enjoy a quality steak and get away from the \"typical\" diners on the strip.",

J and I had just had the Morton's filet and seafood for two deal and were so impressed that we couldn't believe that we were just impressed with Del Frisco's.  Everything was delicious.  We had the house salad (with two strips of thick bacon on top), the filet and crab cake combo and chocolate mousse and butterscotch cheesecake for dessert.  The filet was soooo good; mildly crusted with pepper and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The crab cake had so much crab and almost no \"filler\".  The mousse and cheesecake were good, but by the time they came out, we were soooo full!  THey brought out a piece of lemon cake for my mom's birthday and boy was that great!!!  Light and fluffy and just perfect!  We will definitely be back that next time we're in town!",

Who cares about the sides, there will be no awards given for supporting cast members on this meal.   Accept for the brief appearance by lobster tail, the steak is the headliner. When you go, act like you've been there before, expect to order sides because the steak stands alone and bring your casino winnings so you can pay for your meal.",

Ruth Chris is not even close to this place.    We went in on a wed night I made reservation but probably was not needed as the place was not to busy.  I had the Rib Eye and my wife and the fillet.  Both cooked and seasoned perfectly.    Crab cake & Oyster aptz. were awesome.  sides were great too we had the potato au gratin and mixed vegs..  No room for dessert.  Our waiter Joey was great and the service amazing.  I swear we had at least 3 other people serving our table besides our waiter.   With beer, wine, & tips the bill came out to about $280.  Sure pricey but well worth it and in my opinion a better meal than most of the high end Strip restaurants.     I will surely make this must eat next time i am in LV.    Relax...Enjoy...Eat.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas with 9 of my friends for a bachelor party.  The groom to be wanted to have steak dinner one night, I did some research prior to arriving in Vegas.  After looking through numerous sites for all the steak houses in Vegas, Del Frisco received the highest marks.   Our dinner was on a Saturday night, and I didn't make the reservation until the morning of, and they had no problem taking us in that night for a table of 10.  (I think we didn't have any issues because our reservation was at 9PM)  When we arrived for our reservation, they send us to the bar for a few minutes to get our drinks before dinner, after a couple of minutes; the hostess came by and led us to our table.  We sat in the back corner in the main dining room, the lighting wasn't too bright or too dim, and the ambient was tastefully done. Our servers (we had 3 for our table) were very attentive; the main server recited the specials thoroughly, his recommendations were on point.  Most servers in most restaurants usually recommend the highest price item on the menu, but he did not.  He recommended a red wine that was perfectly balanced with our meal, at $100 per bottle, we ordered 3 for the table, and that was enough for dinner since we will be doing most of the damage later that night. We started off with their crab cakes for appetizer, it was delicious, and I was looking for more after I devoured my in two bites.  I believe everyone else was doing the same thing.  Chopped salad was next, it was very tasty, good pallet cleanser before the main course.   Our main course was phenomenal, everyone's steak was cook perfectly, they will not leave the table until you cut into the center to make sure it's to your satisfaction.  I had the 8oz fillet special cooked medium rare, melted in my mouth, perfectly balance with the sauce that was on my plate, it also came with 2 shrimp, but the star was definitely the fillet.  I get a chance to taste some of the other steaks, they were equally excellent.  For the side dish, make sure you ORDER the LOBSTER MAC and CHEESE, and be sure you ordered more than 1, because you will be looking for more after your first serving.  We did not have room for dessert, everyone was stuffed. If you are looking for a good steak house in Vegas, this is a must, everything I had was delicious.  TWO THUMBS up!",

Here it goes:  My hubby and I are in town for the weekend and one thing that I love about Vegas other than partying, is the FOOD! There are so many great eats out here it's ridiculous.

It just Melts in your mouth! We also split the Lobster Mac n cheese and it was another hit! Not too heavy but nice and creamy... Love love love it!   Our server Liz was beyond awesome and the manager(totally forgot her name) stopped by our table to chat w/us and gave us a huge slice of their incredible lemon cake complimentary for mamas day.

The Filet Mignon is so tender you can cut it with your fork and special sauce on the side for your dipping.

I had made them make it the way I wanted with the dark rum and the right amount of pineapple juice. I like the layered way and mix it when your ready to drink. I would recommend place to all my friends if they wanted a place to go for that special occasion or for a special evening out with your special someone.  Make your reservations if you decide to go here. The service is superb and the attention they will give you. Of course the tipping 20% is appropriate for this place as they will not ignore you.",

I love steak and went here based on a recommendation from a friend. This place is amazing. First off, as soon as you are seated order a VIP martini. This is the best drink I've ever had. But as a disclaimer, it is pretty much pure vodka (which I'm not complaining about). It is so good and worth the $13 price tag.   Food was great as well. I remember the steak being a little over seasoned, but I'm not a big fan of anything salty so I may have been a little sensitive. Waitress was great, she was very attentive, had some good wine recommendations, and was everything you would want in a server. We had a ton of leftover side dishes too, but we ordered three sides between the two of us, so I'd probably do one side per person next time.   Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I always try to make down here when I'm in Vegas...for the VIP martinis. They also have happy hour from like 3-6 Monday-Friday I believe, and the VIP martinis are half off.    The only thing I was sad about was not receiving a thank you card in the mail :(",

    "text": "Just returned from a boys trip to Vegas where Del Frisco's was on the agenda as always.  We had 12 of us in the private wine room (which is a fantastic private room if you are looking for such) for the 6th straight year and as with every visit the staff and food were spot on.  Steaks, fish, appetizers were all expertly prepared.    After a disappointing experience at the usually very good Prime at Bellagio the night before, I just had to make sure Del Frisco's was recognized for their execution.  I've also eaten in the restaurant proper several times and have never been disappointed.",

I've had many phenomenal steaks for a lot less. $65 bone in filet was ok, not great and certainly not worth the price. DO NOT GET SEAFOOD PLATEAU. Shrimp and oysters were sub par, crab was ok, but for $55 I would have expected a lot more. $15 Old Fashioned was as if it was made by an 18 year old in a dorm room for the first time. Outback Steakhouse would be a big step up in food quality/value",

The staff are the best ever.  Very friendly and  very attentive.  They make sure to ask you to cut your steak and ask you to check if it's cooked to your liking before you eat.  I recommend the prime pair menu (it's available on Sundays and all days in the summer).  I recommend the 8 oz filet, crab cakes, and the lobster mac and cheese.  All of those items were delicious!  Thanks for the great service.  It was definitely world class.",

I never quiet got over the lacking atmosphere so I probably won't go back to this location but they get good marks for the food.  oh, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the keyboardist at the bar area.  that definitely harkened back to the old steakhouse days.",

Service was cordial and speedy. Loved the old school steakhouse feel. They have a lovely wooden bar. The place felt very masculine, but in a nice, classy way. Our server took a lot of pride in describing specials and menu items for us. There were a lot of great options on the menu and we first considered ordering a' la carte, but we noticed what a good deal their dinner for two was. On Sundays, they offer a $100 per couple dinner. It includes a salad of your choice, filet mignon and crab cakes, one side dish each and dessert for each person.  I was fully expecting the portions to be smaller because of the meal deal. However, we definitely got full-sized portions. The crab cakes were among the best I've ever had. There was barely any filler and huge chunks of crab throughout. Not really a crab cake, but more of a crab dollop. Loved it! The steak had so much flavor and was cooked perfectly to my medium rare specifications. The filet was the perfect level of pink and the outside seasoning was spot-on. I'm not even a big fan of filet mignon, but this one was like butter. Loved their side dishes too. The mashed potatoes were so decadent and the broccoli gave me the right amount of green, so I didn't feel like a total fatty. I can't remember dessert, except to say I enjoyed it at the time. I think I was in a meat-induced coma and the whole thing is a blur.   While we dined we were entertained by a jazz pianist. Perfect atmosphere to compliment a pitch perfect meal. All of this, combined with easy parking, made it a night to remember. Del Frisco's will always be a part of my Vegas itinerary from now on.",

The bone-in filet was hands down the best steak I've ever had...and I've had a lot of steaks! The sides, crab cakes, and salad we had were also amazing.   The drink? Killer. I can't remember the name of it, but their signature drink is a vodka soaked with pineapple, and not only was it HUGE, I wanted another one!   For the quality of the meat and the service, I think the prices were spot on. I was a bit disappointed that they advertise a dress code, and there were people in there with jeans on. I wish they would enforce that...",

We had also mentioned in our reservation that it was our anniversary.  When we walked into the restaurant and gave our name, the hostess greeted us with a \"Happy anniversary.\" When we were sat, the server brought us a card from the staff wishing us a happy anniversary.  I ordered a bone-in ribeye, my husband ordered a filet, and we shared a side of chateau mashed potatoes. My husband ordered a beer, and I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon. The food was AMAZING. Steak was melt in your mouth good. The wine went very nicely with the meal. After talking with the server and mentioning where we were from, he stated that other people from our hometown frequent the restaurant, are good friends with the chef, and work in the same industry I do.  The chef came out to meet us and was just the nicest man you could ever meet. It turns out we know his good friends! He was very gracious and made us a special salsa to go with our meal. I'm not a big salsa person, but it was DELICIOUS!  The restaurant also gave us a complimentary slice of lemon cake for dessert to celebrate our anniversary.  We couldn't have asked for a better anniversary dinner. This place is well worth the money. We will definitely come here again.",

Say no more. A baseball sized mound of lump crab meat swimming in a creamy rich sauce. Six monster cocktail shrimp with various sauces was equally delicious.  Bone-in rib eye. Perfectly seared. Juicy. Tender. Well balanced seasoning. Topped with melted Foie Gras butter - are you kidding me?!! I savored each and every morsel. Just wish I had more room to finish it off and jaw on that bone.  Lobster mac and sauteed mushrooms were wonderful sides, but we were so full we barely touched them.  Finish it all off with the lemon cake. A perfect end to a perfect meal. Light, moist, fresh and citrusy.  The service was impeccable throughout. Our waitress was a doll and was very attentive - always smiling. The manager came over for a chat.

The flavor was great! It was 32oz of pure bliss!

Great service and setting kind of feels like a lodge. I'd forgotten the sides we ordered but it's probably because it wasn't that great. There isn't any side dish I'd say you have to try but definitely do enjoy your steak. We were able to make reservations for a group of 4 the day before on Open Table so that was great. 5 star steak but 4 stars overall because side dishes were ok and not much to say for ambience. It's what one can expect from a steak house, that typical candlelight rustic ole' feel with good Steaks on your plate.",

Today was finally the day! We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 7pm reservation in which we were promptly greeted by two lovely hostesses that asked for my name for the reservation and immediately wished me a happy birthday. One of them took us to our table and, get ready for this, GAVE ME A BIRTHDAY CARD! And not just any run of the mill birthday card, it was hand written with the words \"Happy birthday\" and a signature from everyone that worked there. The fact that it was hand written and signed was so special to me, I love that it wasn't just some printed card but someone actually took the time to write happy birthday in a card for me. Now onto the good stuff:  Drinks: I ordered the VIP which is their signature cocktail. It's vodka soaked in pineapple for a period of time and then strained. It is a 100% pure vodka martini, no mixer, no nothing. It taste like fresh pineapple juice, delicious! But let me reiterate, it's 100% vodka. Half of my martini made me feel pretty buzzed, I couldn't even finish it because I didn't want to leave crawling out of the place. But it is a delicious drink, better suited for someone with either a bit higher tolerance or looking to do a one and done to get the job done.   Appetizers: we got the thick cut bacon and the crab cakes. The crab cake was the best thing I've ever tasted in my entire existence. I will dream about it forever. The bacon slab was out of this world, it had so much flavor and it had a delicious sweet bourbon molasses sauce that blew me away.  Entree's and sides: I opted for the 16oz prime ribeye while my boyfriend got the 22oz porterhouse. We also got a side of truffle butter for our steak. Let me tell you, this is the best steak I've ever had in my entire lifetime. I've never tasted a steak with so much flavor, so juicy, so tender, and the truffle butter on top of all of that changed my life. I promise you, this is the best meal I've ever had in my life. We also got the potatoes au gratin and some sort of shaved vegetable (think it was the Brussels sprouts, it was my boyfriends side so I didn't pay much attention). I was so overwhelmed with every bite of the steak and too busy expressing how ridiculous every bite was that I found myself never really reaching for my side dish because I couldn't stop digging into my steak. We ended up taking the potatoes home because I couldn't finish them. My boyfriend didn't love the vegetable he got but he didn't hate it, thought there was too much vinegar taste.   Dessert: the restaurant was so kind to send us a lemon cake which was amazing. I'm not even a huge lemon person but this is one of the best cakes I've ever had. The cake was moist and the glaze between the 6 layers we so fresh. The frosting was my favorite part, I think I might have to steal their recipe because it was amazing.  Service: the service was very good, our food came out perfectly coursed and our glasses were always full. We always had a busser or someone taking care of keeping our table clean and taking away plates. Our server wasn't anyone to brag about, he was good but not great just average. Usually I would dock a star but the food really knocked it out of the ball park for me and I would love to give this place a 15/5 stars because it was just that good. He seemed a bit all over the place and distracted but still nice. Hard to explain but his service was very average.   Overall: you'll notice I've used the words amazing, incredible, delicious, best I've ever had, etc. because this is truly the best food I've ever had in my life. This is the best dinner I've ever had. Hands down, the BEST food I've ever eaten in my lifetime. I can't express that enough. I'm begging my boyfriend to take me back. I'm searching for people to brag to left and right. Server: decent, Food: can't even put into words how incredible it was. I cannot wait to come back here for every special occasion ever. Thank you so much Del Frisco's for the amazing amazing meal!!",

Not only does he know his wine, but he is so personable and attentive to the patrons. Our waiter, Roland, made sure we were well taken care of. He went above and beyond, even bringing candles and rose petals for the table (my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary). Everything about this dinner was perfect.

The service was great and the staff was attentive.  Here's what I ordered:  Calamari: The calamari has a unique twist to it.  The calamari was mixed in with some fried peppers and topped with a black sesame seeds, bean sprouts, and a sauce similar to sweet and sour sauce.  I really enjoyed the combination of sweet and tangy with the crunch of the calamari.  Fillet medallions: This entree comes with 3 little medallions with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes.  It was beautifully played.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it didn't disappoint! The filet mignon was very juicy and tender.",

My wife had the Bone-In Prime Ribeye and she's not the carnivore that I am, but she thoroughly enjoyed her steak as she praised how juicy and flavorful it was! I indulged in the Wagyu Tomahawk Chop and.......it was AMAZING! A delicate, mouthwatering cut of meat that melted in my mouth with each bite!   Nothing but exceptional service from the entire staff. They enhanced our dining experience and made us feel at home!

First of all for a weekday night it had a lot of people. I would definitely make sure you reserve ahead to be safe. It's a dressy place but I figured for a tourist area they wouldn't be so strict on it. It does have valet parking but we were given an option to park also which I prefer, always (don't like strangers having my keys)  When you walk in its not DARK like most $$$$ sign places which was great. It sucks eating in the dark! My hubby already had a steak in mind but when we got the menu, it wasn't there. He was sad UNTIL the waiter read us the specials! WAGYU STEAK!!!! It was HUGE but it was unbelievably soft! $90!!! But definitely worth trying! I ordered the rib eye for myself And our little man which I thought was huge already. We had their version of mashed potatoes with chives which was mediocre, nothing special at all. I will go back for the steak which is what the place is known for anyway! Service is outstanding btw! I always rate a place service by my water. If my water cup doesn't have time to empty itself then it's definitely great service!",

Freddy our waiter was very accommodating if not entertaining (apparently he knew the lyrics of Despacito haha), as well as giving us the rundown of Three Square and what the food assistance foundation was meant for. It was nice knowing that even the servers were knowledgeable and supportive of their cause. Many of the employees definitely made us feel welcome, would come by to check up on us a few times, and cleaned up everything per course meal.  Apparently there was a Live pianist playing - music echoed loudly throughout the room. The ambiance being somewhat posh and dimly lit lighting that emitted a warm intimate atmosphere. Seats were plush and comforting. The bar area looked like a giant jukebox with a hidden wine cellar behind it, a unique backdrop in contrast to the dining area.  To start off, we had the lobster bisque, not salty at all - impressive as most places tend to make theirs high in the sodium department.  Friends ordered their ribeye steaks at medium rare - cooked nicely. The servers wanted to double check and have us cut it to make sure it was how we wanted it. The result being that the heat settings was to their liking, thus fulfilling their expectations.   Green beans were satisfyingly crunchy, not salty at all. Mashed potatoes were soft, fluffy, not too flavorful - smooth but not clumpy.  The salmon as my main dish was buttery soft, no fishy smell, and definitely not oily. Surprisingly came on a bed of crab hash (literally made me think of crab fried rice).  For the finishing touch, as a dessert the warm banana bread pudding was soft with every bite, and the vanilla ice cream that came with it wasn't too cold to give me brain freeze nor lackluster in flavor. The cheesecake with pecan crust was pleasant after a few bites, the strawberry sauce not overtly sweet and heartily filled us up to top the night off!",

We made reservations for our anniversary and there was a card signed by the entire staff and we were in a private dining room very nice touch thanks for that.  I believe they would have grilled a dealer at one of the casinos if we had asked for them to  Our private dining room was next to the wine storage, and it was quite a well stocked inventory of vintages, magnums, and I think that was a Nebuchadnezzar because it was a gigantic bottle of wine. Biggest container of fermented grape juice I ever did see!  Food was excellent. Yes, it's pricey, and the overall quality in taste, preparation, and presentation is fantastic. From what I ordered and sampled among sharable plates, you can't go wrong with any menu selection. They will go the extra mile to make sure your entree is made to your satisfaction.  Service was fantastic throughout the evening. The waitstaff checked on us early and often. Drinks were refilled regularly. It's a good thing we were sequestered from the open dining areas because after a few rounds of cocktails and wine bottles, we got loud and obnoxious. Despite our shenanigans, service remained professional and tolerant. Our waitress was well versed in the menu and made suggestions to compliment and enhance entree selections. Whether you're in Las Vegas or other entertainment destination, it's an added bonus to have a knowledgeable waitstaff, bartender, or other industry professional who might have inside info or the hookup to a nearby hotspot. Take care of them and they might return the courtesy.  Definitely a superb experience at Del Frisco's.",

This Del Frisco's location has to be the best compared to its sister locations throughout the nation. The service, staff, atmosphere, food and drinks are top notch. I recommend the VIP martini. The crab cake appetizer is crack; velvety smooth, plenty of crab meat and its flavor is a one-of-a-kind. The thick-cut bacon is absolutely meaty and delicious, just make sure you come in with an empty stomach for it to have more room for your entree and sides. The oysters (west and east coast) are fresh. I order my steak medium-rare and it's on point. Lobster Mac and cheese is great. Creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin are fabulous as well.   If you are in search of a steakhouse in Las Vegas, and there are plenty of good ones. There's just something about Del Frisco's Las Vegas that just makes you come back. Well for myself, it's every time .",

    "text": "Came here on our final night in Vegas to celebrate a super super early birthday. Our party made reservations prior to coming in and was seated less than 5 minutes upon arrival.   Located not too far from the Las Vegas Strip, Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse features 8 private dining rooms, a wine cellar, and they are widely know for their James Bond Table. Valet parking is complimentary, you have the option of indoor or outdoor seating, there is a and the dress code is business casual.  Our dining experience started off with complimentary bread and not being a fan of sesame, I didn't enjoy the carbs as much as i had hoped. No joke, the sesame taste is pretty intense.  We ordered: 22oz Bone-In Prime Ribeye 24oz Prime Porterhouse Sauteed Wild Mushrooms & Pearl Onions Classic Caesar Salad  Food came out in a timely manner and was cooked to our liking. I appreciated the waiter's request for you to cut into the steak and confirm your satisfaction before heading off. The wild mushrooms are an absolute must have- they are seasoned well and elevates your steak to new heights. I could have done without the caesar salad, nothing made the dish stand out.   Overall: Great food, wonderful service, but there was a strange smell that the establishment reeks of... I couldn't figure out what it was but due to me feeling nauseous prior to coming in, the scent was such a turnoff.",

    "text": "For our early dinner before with our friend before our flight back home, our friend suggested we eat at Del Frisco's since it was off the Strip on Paradise and the airport was right down Paradise. Our friend said they have a great happy hour and we were able to get the one open table as the bar seating was full.  The bar was next to the main dining room, but there are several smaller intimate dining areas.    We ordered our drinks and checked out the happy hour menu which consisted of nine items, which were 50% off. Our order consisted of: Charbroiled Oysters, garlic butter and Parmesan cheese. These were so tasty that we had two orders. The oyster were garlic butter then crusted with Parmesan.   Buffalo Shrimp, blue cheese dressing, crumbles, smoked bacon bits and green onions. Lightly battered shrimp were complemented well with the blue cheese dressing.    Beef Filet Sliders, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, fontina cheese, truffle oil and horseradish sauce. The slice of filet in the slider was tender.  Though it was good, it was ok in comparison to our other dishes.   Broiled Steak Salad, mixed greens, grilled asparagus, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and vinaigrette.  It was a nice salad with the additions of asparagus, artichokes and red peppers.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.   Seared Filet Tips, mashed potatoes, onion rings, red-wine demi-glace, and bourbon peppercorn sauce. This was a hearty dish with the seared filet tips over a large portion of mashed potatoes.  Tasty too.    Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. Needed a dessert to top off our meal. Our waiter recommended this dessert. Wow, it was large piece of cake topped with a large scoop of ice cream. Though desserts are not part of the happy hour menu, this was worthy of a nice ending to a meal.  Near the entrance, there is a display case that contains custom painted bottles of wine depicting each James Bond movie. The top opens up to the James Bond theme revealing the bottles of wine.  So cool.  Ask the hostess to see the display.   The Happy Hour menu at the bar area is a great deal. Great food at 50% off.  Del Frisco might be a little off the Strip, but with free parking and mellower atmosphere, it is worth it in my book.  A great way to conclude our Vegas trip.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas this past week celebrating my husband and my birthday within a week of each other. I asked my friends for restaurant recommendations and Del Friscos kept coming up for steak and seafood. We decided to try it out. We stayed at the Bellagio and took an Uber to the location. It is a little off the strip kind of in an office park type of location. Hostess staff was very friendly and as we were early offered to have us sit in the bar for a cocktail while our table was being prepared. The bar was full and there was no chairs available so we just waited. The restaurant's decor was an updated version of a steak house with white table cloths, booths and smoked mirrors. I really liked the crystal chandelier feature, I thought they were beautiful and classy. Our waiter was very nice and attentive and very knowledgeable about the steaks and seafood. I had heard about a pineapple specialty drinks. They are called the VIP - Vodka Infused Pineapple. Oh my goodness, they were amazing! But sneaky lol.   My husband ended up ordering the filet and I order the lobster tail and we ordered potatoes au gratin to share. No appetizers, or soup or salad as we felt like that would be a lot of food. Well let me tell you, that lobster tail was huge! The food runner said that it was actually a smaller tail! The lobster was tender and sweet and just plain incredible! The potatoes were tasty and decadent. At the end of the meal our food server was kind enough to bring us a scrumptious dessert to celebrate our birthdays of butter cake, that was to die for and chocolate cake.... so good. Such a wonderful experience..... we will be back for sure!",

This one has a 007 special wine installation that's worth a few million I believe. Great service here, and hidden away from all the mayhem on the strip.",

We've never been here before but we had the pleasure of meeting a very nice manager at the Venetian Hotel in Vegas that we stayed at for a 4 days and we asked him what's the best steakhouse in Vegas (off or on the strip) and without skipping a beat he said Del Frisco's is the best steak he's ever had!  This comes from a manager who has steakhouses in his hotel)  He went on and on about this place so we made a reservation.   Let me just say the feel when you walk in was very romantic... very nice.   Our server was beyond fantastic!  She was spot on with every detail and explained things to give you an experience and feel like we've never had before.  It made you feel like you've been dinning ther for years .   The steak we had was full of flavor and so incredibly tender... delicious!   The dessert was so seriously an experience in itself... I can't even describe how delicious it was... it was that good!  We had the pleasure of meeting one of the managers \"Amber\" who wanted to make sure our experience was fantastic and it was!!!  This place is first class delicious!  Thank you",

Came here to celebrate our anniversary and was super impressed with the service amongst so many of their staff. Everyone was super attentive and friendly. Our server Marciano was super nice and seriously knew when to come in or stay away as we were having a personal conversation and I am really grateful for that!   I'm glad I got to try this spot out when we were in Vegas. Came during the dinner time and it was nice and not too crowded. Guest that were dining in weren't loud and obnoxious which was pretty nice.   What we ordered:   Shrimp platter- Comes with a variety of different sauces on a shrimp so you can try it out. Large size of shrimp and loads of flavor.   Crab Cake- A huge amount of crab and it had a wonderful sauce on it.   1 Pound Stone- Its kind of famous in Vegas and a must to order. Get the stone crab claws they are totally different from the normal claws of crabs!   What there famous for- \"The Long Bone\" 32oz of beef yep its huge and juicy!!   For a side we got asparagus and they threw in their famous lemon cake afterwards for free!   Overall yes I would totally recommend this place. The inside is an old school feel and just the management team knows how to hire really good people! I was so happy for our anniversary dinner.   Thank you for making me feel so special and yes the food was totally perfect!! I'd say this is on my top list of places to visit to have a wonderful dinner. You won't regret it.",

I never had a steak that was so flavorful and juicy from the outside all the way down to the bone.  Normally, the outside is juicy then as you get toward the middle, steaks become tough but not the case here.  I live in California and unfortunately their other Del Frisco Grill restaurants (Irvine, Santa Monica, Pasadena) do not carry this steak so I can only have this in Las Vegas.  I guess this will be my go to restaurant every time I am in Vegas.  If you have a large appetite and love ribeye's as I do, this should be on your bucket list of steaks to try.  At $89, it is pricey but worth every juicy, flavorful bite.",

We ordered the shrimp cocktail-it was delicious!  I cant say enough about the bread.  I know its a steak house and Im talking about the bread.  Sesame loaf fresh out of the oven.  I wanted to take some home!!!  To die for.   We both ordered the filet with the lobster mac.  The filets cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth.  The mac (a shared side) a little on the flavorless side.  Definitely needed salt.  We were so full and then here came this big piece of lemon cake on the house for -thats right-our anniversary.  The only thing I can say after this wonderful experience is when we were leaving we asked the valet guy to take our picture-for our anniversary.  He seemed very disinterested and took a couple blurry shots with no care how they turned out.  I know thats not his job but we weren't interupting him and a little customer service as we left would have been nice.  Oh well.  ...and if you are asking yourself if we valeted our car, the answer is no. LOL There is plenty of parking right in front-It was a Sunday night remember. ;)  Always recommended and for the price it is a definite \"special occasion place\"....we don't go there too often but when we do we are glad we did.",

    "text": "Double eagle prime----OMG! This charred rare steak was among the best I've ever had. I'm not into meat or steaks or the steakhouse experience, but the BF is. So I decided to surprise him with dinner at this place which by all accounts is considered the best steakhouse in Vegas. I even ate a little before heading out knowing that it was going to be another grilled fish/chicken night because I don't eat meat. The BF was so excited that he diligently researched blogs and Yelp to find out exactly what cut and size of meat to order. He soon learned that he had to get it rare and charred on the outside. Omg, how I regret not ordering the beef.   The service was spectacular. Attentive, but not annoying, friendly and warm. The house bread was fresh baked, crunchy and collapsed the moment you broke off a piece because it was so squishy and air fluffed on the inside. The drinks were stiff, the wine list was huge with an extensive and creative by-the-glass selection.   But his meat was my star. I hope my mom's not reading this. It was so delicious. It was so good, I could have eaten the whole thing--all 25+ ounces. It was theperfect combo of moist yet crunchy-salty outside. My mouth is salivating as I type this.   Definitely worth the price and we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Del Frisco's has been on my list of places to try out for awhile. (There's a happy hour there that I want to try out one of these days which ends at 6:30.)  It was a fairly large celebration with 10 of us which was perfect for a Del Frisco's night. We were seated  right away in the corner which was perfect for us.   Since I am the \"foodie\" of the group, I was appointed the job to order the side dishes and the appetizers. We started of with 2 orders (6 per an order) of the East and West Coast Oysters. I think the West coast oysters were bigger than the East Coast....the quality was excellent as was the freshness. I didn't even use Tabasco or any other sauce! I also ordered the tuna tartare, which was fresh and tasty. I was definitely ready for my main course after that.  For my main dish I ordered one of the specials. Two filets, one with crab and one with scallop/shrimp. I liked the flavoring of the crab filet more, but both filets were tender and easy to eat. I do appreciate the fact that they have you cut into the meat to make sure it is to your liking when they first give you your entree. I wonder what they do with the meats that are too overcooked....Side dishes included the lobster mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and grilled asparagus. The potatoes and lobster mac and cheese didn't WOW me, but I did appreciate the veggies although the spinach was VERY creamy.   There was a pianist there who was performing which made the noise level a bit hard to hear people in my group talk, but other than that Del Frisco's was wonderful. Service was impeccable and attentive. I definitely will be back!",

    "text": "I have been to a lot of restaurants.. and a lot of steakhouses.. and Del Frisco's takes the prize for both favorite restaurant and favorite steakhouse!  I first visited last year and was very impressed but wasn't sure if we just lucked out.  You know what I am talking about, a \"hit & miss\" restaurant, you \"hit\" on your first visit, get really excited to go back only to get a horrible \"miss\" the next time.  I am happy to report Del Frisco is not such a restaurant!  I just visited again last week, and it even exceeded my already high expectations from my first visit.  Things I have had so far:  Appetizer: Crab Cake - take a note from Nike, and just do it.  It's epic.  The sauce they place it in is absolutely incredible and it doesn't have all that BS breading most places have.  On my second trip there was no way I could pass up having this delicacy again, so we ordered it again and were very very pleased.  Entree: Filet Mignon - Medium Rare.  They cooked it PERFECTLY.  We noticed they have Crab Cakes on the entree menu and I think the next time we would split the Crab Cake Entree and the 12 oz filet for a real treat.  I am really not going to get to try the other items due to my high satisfaction with the ones we have already tried.  Dessert: Bread Pudding & Yellow Cake.  Both incredible, but when it comes to desserts I am going to give that prize to Eddie V's and their Banana Foster.  Drinks: Have tried their specialty cocktails and wine, service and taste were great on both.  Service:  They make you feel like you are the only table in the restaurant.  I also like that it's not as stuffy as most steak houses, the staff is very down to earth.  Ambiance: They even get high marks here, they have live classy music playing throughout dinner.  I  think of going to Vegas just to eat here again!!    10/10",

When it's good, it's quite good. This is the worst.  Our steaks were charred and dry throughout. This must be the new definition of medium. The sides were so salty we needed several water refills. The service is what you'd expect at an expensive joint: efficient but a bit removed. And the prices are steep.  So many excellent steak options in Vegas. Not this one.",

They also have a very impressive wine selection, that would go very well with your dinner. And the last thing that also thought was very cool its the tour of the restaurant that our server gaves us, they take you and show you the famous 007\" wine table (which is super cool) right after they take to their one of a kind Wine Cellar! You will probably see the biggest wines you have ever seen! As they do this they told you about theirs wine selection and a lil bit of the restaurant's history.

We dined twice last week - once with 6 people and once with 15 people during a convention, so I was able to try a bit of everything.  Everything is amazing.    Best appetizers: Chopped salad, calamari, crab cakes, onion rings.  Best side dishes:  Lobster Mac n Cheese (I would eat just this all night long if I could!), Spinach supreme (to die for), cream corn.  Best main courses:  Bone-in filet done medium or less is pretty much guaranteed to be the best thing you have ever eaten in your life.  It's about $65 alone so pricey is a given, but it is simply amazing.  I also recommend the bone-in ribeye, regular 8-12oz filet, and the shrimp scampi if you aren't in a meat mood.   Best dessert:  Creme Brulee!  You will likely need reservations, some nice clothes and a full pocketbook, but you will not leave disappointed or hungry as portions are quite large. Service is always phenomenal as well :)  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Del Frisco's was on our to do list for a Bachelor Party I went to, and quite frankly-I feel like I'll have to pay this place a visit every time I visit Vegas.  I'm going to go straight to the food. Some delicious, warm sesame bread and butter came out. Moments later, we ordered the crab cakes which was sitting in a pool of sauce that my brother says they use the enriching guts inside the grab (much tastier than it sounds). This was hands down the best crab cake I have eaten in my life - just lumps and lumps of fresh crab that made you think they literally JUST cracked a crab open and just used the meat from that...   For 6 guys, we ordered 3 of these Flintstones specials (Wagu (sp?) bone-in ribeye). These feed 2 people for about $90. When they came out, they were piping hot and we ordered them 3 diff ways: medium, medium rare, and rare (warm). They seemed to have cooked it all appropriate though the medium rare and rare didn't seem to different in terms of color. But why nitpick? After taking a bite into this piece of meat, you're mind just savors the simplicity of the salt/pepper and natural juices of the meat. OMG, as you get closer and closer to the actual bone, it just tastes great.  You'll have to order some sides to go along with you meal. We opted for the lobster mac and cheese (5/5), the potatoes gratin with bacon, though my actual scoop didn't have any (4/5) and the mushrooms (4/5). If you have 6 hungry guys, probably order one of each will be enough since you still have a ways to go for the rest of the evening and don't want to be stuffed... if not, maybe double up on one of the side dishes or order another one.  Service was great, seemed like 6+ people were tending to our table. It kind of reminded me of a Nascar race when the car needs to make a pit stop. Drinks are reasonably priced here as well, surprisingly.  Man, I need to plan my next trip just so I can hit up Del Frisco's again!",

Ive never had anything like it and it was huge.  The marbling on this thing was amazing.  It was so tender and juicy.  Definitely worth the money let just say its above $80+.  But you have to try it once.  Any other steak will not even come close.  Ive tried the double eagle and that is amazing as well.  Their sizes were ok but the bacon spinach and garlic mash was the best.  Our drinks were well-alcholized so no complaints there.  Don't eat all day and just eat like primate here.  Of course the service was on point and professional.  Worth every penny. hey your in Vegas gotta go big or jsut dont come at all. Hahaha",

We started my birthday dinner off with the tuna tartare and the calamari..  both were excellent apps.. one of my cousins had the Svedka vodka infused pineapple cocktail (the VIP... get it?!?) which I had a sip from and enjoyed a lot.  Our sides for the dinner were the asparagus, potatoes au gratin, and the lobster mac and cheese.  All were good but the lobster mac and cheese stood out.. mostly b/c I love me some mac and cheese.  For dinner I ordered the 16 oz prime ribeye cooked medium. As per our server's recommendation, I cut into it to determine if the doneness was correct... I did and it was cooked perfectly, or so I tthought. As I started to cut off a piece for my tablemates to try the steak, it turned out to be a step below rare.   I advised our server about the doneness of my steak and he apologized and he sent it back.  A few minutes later, another gentleman in a suit came up to me and apologized about the doneness of my steak.  When it came back, MY OH MY, best steak I've had all year.  The service throughout dinner was solid. Waters were promptly refilled.  When my beer was close to being empty I was asked if I wanted another.   As a postscript to my review, towards the end of the dinner, I filled out one of their mailing cards just for the hell of it. This week, I recived a hand written thank you card from our server thanking me and my party for having my birthday dinnner there.  That blew my mind away.  So, 4.5 stars out of 5. It would have been 5 but the 1/2 star deduction was because I had to send my steak back. But everything else was perfect.  Better than the other steakhouse I went to in Vegas earlier in the year.",

I know there are others out there that are a little better for a little more money, but I have always wanted to come here and just never made the time.  The atmosphere and setting is very nice...very upscale and classy.  The service is outstanding as well....some of the best service we have had.  I also asked the hostess to make sure our wine selection came out with the Swarovski crystal flutes I just bought, and it was done without question and seemed happy to do so!  To start, the crab cakes are one of the best things ever.  I HATE crab cakes....I don't like the breading taste, consistency, or whatever it is that in my mind dislikes CCakes, but I tried some and wish I ordered more.  These are so good, and don't taste anything like a regular joe shmoe CC that I have ever had....in a good way.  The sides were also amazing.  We had the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes...both super scrumptious.  On to the important stuff...the meat!  Went with the bone in ribeye...and the bone in filet mignon.  Both were excellent cuts, super tasty, and had a nice crusty sear on the outside packed with flavor.  Since these meats aren't aged, they aren't fair to compete with some of the better steaks in vegas, but what is nice, is their rub/seasoning...much more rich and diverse.  Either way, I think you will have an excellent time here!",

Nobody can compare to your perfectly aged, bone-in prime rib-eye steak soaking in just the right amount of butter, and topped with the most simple but perfectly applied season of salt and pepper.  Your steak was so perfectly done, rare as I like it, and even with a warm center as offered by your very attentive and charming waitress.  You've left me dreaming every night of those very tender, succulent rib eye morsels.  Babe, you're the only one for me.  I promise.  Your gargonzola and blue cheese macaroni is like none other.  A very cheesy blend, with just the right amoung of blue to give it a tang, but not overpowering.  Aaah... It went so well with the steak.  And the chopped salad?  I've never tasted an herb dressing like that.  Just incredible.  Not too rich, not too light and herbish.  And your 6 layer lemon doberge cake consummated my love for you.  Each bite was so moist and rich, with a nice tangy lemon taste, tamed by the rich butter cream frosting.  You took me to paradise and back.  It was a night to remember.    I know what the others have said.  You're taste is too expensive, you're geographically undesirable (GUD), You're not good for me.  But none of that matters.  You're just a flight away and you're worth any amount of trouble babe.  I already miss you.  For now on, it's just you and me.  Oh.. and the wife too.  She liked you as much as I did.  Thank you Julie (our waitress) and Torryn (manager) for helping to make such a pleasurable dining experience.  Del Frisco's truly is the best steak house, and you guys provide absolute top rate service.",

However, in the past few years, I have come to associate it with the BEST steakhouse I have ever eaten at - Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House.

And the food, oh the food is incredible!  My personal favorite is the filet mignon medium rare with a generous helping of their mac n' cheese, cream corn, and potatoes au gratin...yum.  Given that I do not go to Vegas all that often, I have tried out many a steakhouses in Los Angeles and not one has come close.

When we arrived, we did have to wait about 30 minutes AFTER our confirmed reservation time! Was it their way of punishing us? (Minus 1 star!) It was okay coz we got to chill at their bar where a pianist was playing!  Some people actually started dancing!  We finally sat down at our table and ordered drinks! They were really stiff...i mean my martini was enough to last me the whole dinner! I ordered the 10 oz carpetbagger steak and it was the perfect size! My bf ordered the 16 oz bone in ribeye and he said it was better than the Palm! (awww...sorry Palm!)  We also ordered steamed asparagus and chateau potatoes! Both were delicious!  The asparagus were swimming in butter though...they were slippery little things!  Great steakhouse..and it was nice to finally eat somewhere great off the strip!",

I was able to locate this steakhouse via Yelp and immediately recognized it.  First of all, it's probably been about 3 years since I've eaten there, but that does not mean that any ounce of my being has forgotten about the delicious steak and everything else I consumed that very night. Now, I love a good steak. I order steaks the way they should be ordered, medium rare. And I am not usually a fan of having any type of crust or marinade on a steak because I love the real flavor of the meat. I am only saying this so that you know that this review comes from someone who actually loves steak.  Now, if you are finding yourself in Vegas or are going there for whatever reason, and you are looking for a good steakhouse, you MUST go to this place. Sure, it will cost you a pretty penny, but to me it's worth it.  Ambiance is good, steak is absolutely cooked to perfection, and all the side dishes are killer.",

Service was spectacular. Our waiter even sent us a nice thank-you card since we filled out the service survey. haha.  We also ordered cocktail shrimp (good) and some potatoes (which we will pass up next time). We didn't read very carefully, and the potatoes were essentially $8 freshly made potato chips. Yea, no thanks. I'll stick to seafood and steak.  But a definite must if you visit Vegas. Pricey but one of the best steakhouses. Located away from the strip, quiet, seems to cater to a lot of business/professional people.",

We went around the holidays so everything was decorated for Christmas. They had a live piano which was also a nice touch. The food was just OK. The Shanghai-Style Fried Calamari was drenched in a sweet chili glaze, and was super salty. I ordered a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus, per the usual. The flavor of the steak was good, but still not as good as Mastros. It also came out medium rare, a lil too rare for my liking. Other friends at the table also had to get their steaks reheated. Kind of odd?? We ordered sides: potato au gratin, corn, and creamed spinach. All the sides were typical sides, nothing special. At the end they gave us a slice the lemon cake (we were celebrating a birthday), and I would have to say that the lemon cake probably stole the show. The cake was super moist, and the frosting was a lil tart and perfect texture. The service was good. I think our waiter was in training because the manager was following him everywhere, but I think he did just fine. Overall, I'm glad I got to try it... But for the same price, I think I'll stick with Mastro's.",

Every year we try a new steakhouse on yelp so I was so excited to try this place out. We aren't seafood people, so steak it was and we decided on the Wagyu Ribeye to share. It is $90, but makes sense if you plan on sharing. We also had chateau potatoes and my husband got his mac n' cheese sans lobster but adding bacon. The steak came out sizzling hot on a plate that was equally as hot. They carved it up at the table and then we got to devour it. My husband said his mac n cheese was some of the best he has ever had. Then for our anniversary, they brought us a piece of the lemon cake. I was so full from dinner I could not eat but a few bites, but that too was good. Overall, I was very happy with the meal and the service. I would recommend it.",

This place will become that replacement. Even though we are locals tonight was our first visit to Del Frisco's and it was very good. Got there early for 5 o'clock reservation had drinks at the bar, then seated at a really good quiet table. Our waiter was very good attentive knowledgable about the special menu for NYE. The manager came over while we were waiting for desert and welcomed us and asked if we had a good time. If there is something(s) I would suggest is that maybe not put garlic in nearly every dish i.e. the potatoes both had garlic(augraten potatoes don't usually have garlic) and the asparagus would be much better saute'd or grilled with butter and sprinkled with parmesan cheese instead of steamed with almond slices. My husband had the surf and turf filet and lobster tail and I had the salmon with asparagus as a side. For desert I ordered the chocolate mousse which was so light and delicious. Neither of us are big eaters so we were stuffed with what we had and i ordered the strawberry cheesecake to go for my husband and brought the rest of my desert home for tomorrow. We are looking forward to going there more often and becoming regulars. Thank you to the staff for a very enjoyable night out. Happy New Year.",

My brother went here previously and told me that it was outstanding.  So, I couldn't wait.  It was busy the night we went and we were with a large group.  I ordered my favorite cut, ribeye medium rare.  The atmosphere was good, the service was friendly.  But the service was slow.  Perhaps I hit a busy night and was with a large group.  But my steak was not good.  My ribeye was the size of a filet mignon (so I guess they didn't like me) and it was almost well done.  When I complained, they tried to convince me that it was cooked properly.  Then they told me it would take a while since it was so busy to get a new ribeye.  I was too irritated so I didn't reorder.  Meanwhile I checked out my buddies steaks and they all looked overcooked too.  My brother was also disappointed with his meal and thinks we were the victims of bad luck/coincidence.  I'm sure he will come back since he got a great steak here before, but he will have to come without me.  If I pay a high price for steak, I expect a great steak which didn't happen.  I don't care if they are busy since that is no excuse.",

    "text": "Excellent food (for the most part), excellent service (for the most part), and excellent value (for the most part).  See why it \"only\" got 4 stars?  A four man group arrived for a bachelor party, hoping for a delicious dinner and a start of a very memorable night and weekend.  Steaks, wine, and appetizers were ordered.    Many have already detailed the food, so I won't go on and on about the food, except to bring out a couple of highlights and lowlights.  The crab cake, as people have said, was delicious - as was the calamari appetizer, which was drizzled in some sweet and spicy Asian sauce.  Skip the bread - it's not that great, is very simple, and will only take up room in your stomach.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  Get whatever steak you like, and I'm sure it will be done well.  Some of the sides were also stellar.  I've never really had anyone cook asparagus as perfectly - I love it when it's slightly crunchy.  The mashed potatoes had a slight kick to it as well, and was great - I'm a fan of food that comes out piping hot.    Some of the lowlights though, included the lobster mac and cheese.  For me, it could have been cheesier.  I'm really not partial to being able to pick up individual pieces of pasta - I want pieces of lobster and cheese clinging to it.  Also, there was an error in the server simply forgetting that we had ordered the mashed potatoes.  Hey, if you want your 5 stars, you'll definitely have earned it!  After appys and entrees and a bottle of reasonably priced red wine, there was no room left for dessert - simply espressos and coffees.    As many have said before, for Las Vegas, and especially compared to prices on the strip, this is a great value and is a solid choice if you're looking for a steakhouse.",

Everyone - from the hostess to the servers to the bathroom attendant - was attentive, friendly, and really down to earth. To me, service makes the difference between a good dining experience and a really great one.   And Del Frisco's was a pretty great one.   For starters, we had the shrimp with three dipping sauces. I can't remember all three sauces, but I do remember the basil-garlic - it was delicious! The shrimps were plump and succulent. It was a very good start to our meal.  For the main course, I ordered the 12 oz. bone-in fillet: one of the daily specials. I think it was the best cut of meat and most flavorful steak I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and my favorite part, the crust, was salty, peppery, and crunchy. Mmm.   The guy and I split a trio of family-sized sides. The portions were huge. Each side is definitely enough for 4 people, so I would definitely recommend limiting the number of sides you order. We had the macaroni and cheese (SO GOOD), the asparagus (needed salt), and the mashed potatoes (pretty tasty).   Del Frisco's is off the Strip, but I would definitely recommend making a trip to this restaurant. It is definitely worth the trek.",

We also got the Tomahawk Steak, it was a bit chewy for our liking. If we came back here, I would order a filet mignon or something more tender. The cocktail menu was creative and different. They have a unique house-made Pinnapple Vodka that they soak for days, which is in the VIP cocktail. I recommend this drink for vodka lovers.   PRICE: I felt like the value was there. It is clear from the dining experience that the restaurant puts a lot of heart and soul into the meals. I feel it was reasonably priced for what we received and the size of the portions as well.   AMBIANCE: There was a piano guy who was entertaining to watch and listen to during our meal. The lighting and ambiance is what you would expect from an old-fashion steakhouse. Definitely, check out the James Bond wine collection and display.   SERVICE:  The service was a bummer that night. The bartender did say this is slow season and they appeared understaffed last night. There was also a lot of large parties so the service was all over the place and there was a time when people forgot about us. However, at the end of the meal the server made up for it with a complimentary cake since we were celebrating our anniversary.   Happy Dining,   J Tran",

    "text": "Del Frisco's is as good as it gets in my opinion.    With some serious dieting ahead of both Terri R and I, a weekend of cheat meals filled our calendar.  I have to be honest, I originally wanted Ruth Chris but they were booked this evening.  So, I ended up making reservations here solely based on other Yelper's reviews.  Great choice Mel! Pat myself on my back time.   First of all, service was top notch.  It all started with the lovely and very nice, Priscilla.  From start to finish, she was delightful, helpful, and made our dining experience that much better.  Along with great service from Priscilla, we received the same type service from everyone serving the food.  This place is stacked with employees that go out of their way to make you feel like you and your date are the only ones in the restaurant.  Your unsightly empty dishes are swept away with the quickness and they even clean up around you with their handy dandy table swifters.  All this pampering during dinner and you wouldn't even notice it until they're gone  Now for the food.  We got their Prime Pair, which is their $49 per person Prix Fixe. This is a special only running through Labor Day so hurry up peeps.  This is a great deal.   Prime Par (Prix Fixe) 1.  Salads:  You get your choice of salads from their Del's, Wedge, or Caesar.  We both got their Caesar. Although it was good, it was a just a beast to eat since it wasn't chopped.  Terri worked her way through the salad and I didn't because I thought it was too much work. Not docking Del's because you don't go to a steakhouse and review their salad.   2.  Dinner Bread:  Nothing special here.  You get a loaf of their sesame bread.  For a place that serves quality food, the bread was less than average.  But again, you don't come to a steak house for bread.    3.  The entree is an 8 oz hand cut Filet Mignon with your choice of crab cakes, shrimp, or scallops.  I had the crab cakes, which is drenched in lobster sauce.  My goodness....this was delicious.  Terri had the shrimp and she said it was delicious as well.  She offered, but I was focused on my meal.  Now for the filet mignon....this was the 1st highlight.  Great tasting filet, high protein, and tasted like any other top notch steakhouse out here.  I mean it.  This steak can give Ruth Chris a run for their money and it's probably a tad healthier since it's not drenched in butter.  Their steaks didn't have that melt in your mouth feel, but it did have that taste of a well prepped filet.   4.  Sides:  You also have a choice of sides that included potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and corn. We got the potatoes, mushrooms, and for an additional cost, added their Lobster Mac N Cheese.  The 2nd highlight to this evening had to be their Lobster Mac.  Creamy/cheesy mac, lobster chunks, and a hint of lobster sauce describes this. Tough to explain, but it's probably the best lobster mac that I have ever had.    Overall, I am giving Del Frisco's 5 stars because I expected just an okay, above average dining experience and obviously got more.  I was so consumed with my beautiful date and superb dining experience, I even forgot to snap a few photos.  But at a place like this, photos would just ruin the experience anyway.   Looking for filet mignon, a great dining experience, and somewhere off the strip...look to Del Frisco's.  You won't be disappointed.",

Pump the brakes please! I have cooked professionally for over 20 years in the Midwest and believe it or not we Eat Steaks-lots of them. Everyone has their own idea of what R.MR.M.MW.W is to them. All, I wanted is to have the server say-we will have the broiler chef cook them longer and bring them out asap sorry we missed your expectations. I visit this location twice a year and refer others to try it out. I will be changing those plans yearly now and pump the brakes on the referring",

    "text": "I am not much of a steakhouse fan, but I was cordially invited by Randal R. and his family to celebrate his graduation of dual masters degrees, an amazing feat!  The entire state of California seems to be related to him, so we had a sizable group in a private room.  Service was magnificent, and server Andrew knew this family well from its history with Del Frisco's.  This family racks up DF dining points like Eric R. obsesses over credit card points!  I enjoyed rose sparkling wine in the celebratory mode.  We started off with shrimp cocktail (which has this amazing shallot-butter sauce that was so yummy) and tuna tartare with toasts that had olive tapenade on them!  I believe there was a crudite tray but I did not seek it out.  Due to our large group, we had a set menu to choose from that was printed nicely at each place setting.  I started off with the house salad sans bacon, which came with avocado goddess dressing...yes!  Eric R. got the classic Caesar with anchovies.  Next, we both got filet (there were many entree options, but for steak 8 oz filet or 16 oz ribeye).  The filet was flavorful, perfectly tender, and cooked exactly like we wanted.  I ate my entire steak....yum!  The sides for the table included skillet potatoes (essentially house made chips) with caramelized onions on top (yes!) and green beans with garlic, also very good.  For dessert, a choice between strawberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse.  I had the mousse, and it was rather decadent.  I really enjoyed the experience, especially our visit to the James Bond table.  This restaurant is a labyrinth though, enormous and full of happy eaters.  When we got there it was early and quiet, but when I had to look for the restroom I got lost in a maze of people and hallways.  What a delicious way to celebrate educational success!",

    "text": "I died, went to heaven and they served me a Del Frisco filet.  It's either that or it's because I don't usually eat meat, this steak is comparable to that of other high end steakhouses. Don't take my word for it, you should try this place even if steak isn't your thing. Here's why.    Del Frisco's chopped salad: with iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots and other leafy vegetables, a creamy ranch dressing, it is topped with crumbled blue cheese and two long strips of bacon. Yes, actual strips of bacon! This salad was the perfect size to start off your meal.  Calamari: Don't expect this item to be your typical fried and slightly seasoned calamari. The calamari is breaded and fried, then mixed with a tangy hot and sweet sauce. Very unexpected. Very savory and very delicious!  Crab cakes: 100% all crab meat with no unnecessary ingredients to distract you. Baked in a delicious creamy lobster sauce. Rich and fulfilling and oh so good!!!  After the appetizers, I ordered items from the pre fixe menu which includes an 8 oz. filet, spinach supreme and scallops. While the scallops were too salty for my taste, the steak was an experience all in itself. At medium rare, it melted in my mouth at just the right combination and amount of seasoning. Del Frisco knows its steak as this steak deserves an applause!  Finally, I got to experience one of the most important items on the menu: the banana bread pudding. After a short period of high anticipation and excitement, it arrived at our table on a rather big plate. With a scoop of ice cream and a scoop of whip cream on top, it sat a top a layer of caramel sauce. So decadent, so rightly sweet, this bread pudding can beat any competitions any day!  As we walked our the door, I noticed this place looks rather mediocre on the inside. And of course, the James Bond table was a fun thing to experience. ;)",

Let me tell you that everything from the water to the lemon cake was amazing.  The service was great, the ambiance, the decor and the fact that they had game 5 of the 2016 NLDS was simply sensational.    This was one of the best steaks I have ever had anywhere here in this fine country.  I had the 22oz bone in ribeye and my partner had the 8oz fillet cooked perfectly.  To accompany these fine cuts of meat we ordered the silky smooth lobster mac and a side of seasonal mushrooms which came sauteed with garlic and baby onions. The  sides were so damn delicious it would of been a meal in its own.   However, what stole the show was our appetizer..  we had 1 crab cake with lobster sauce and let me tell you that it was simple the best crab cake I've ever had. The taste buds were running wild in my mouth after every bite.   To cap off the dinner , they brought us a complementary slice of there famous lemon cake  as we enjoyed watching the Dodgers defeat the Nationals in a thrilling elimination game to advance to the 2016 NLDS.   Over all my experience at Del Frisco's was amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas.",

    "text": "It has been a few years so it's time for an update!  Del Frisco is still a fantastic steak option and probably the best chain steakhouse I've been to.  The one star off is only because other steak restaurants have raised the bar even higher in Vegas.    We dined with a friend that's a regular so the host just brought over several plates of appetizers of his choosing which included crabcakes, shrimp cocktail, fried calamari and onion rings.  All of them were great with the crabcakes being my favorite.  The sauce was boss!!  I got the prime ribeye medium rare and even though it was good, it's just not five stars anymore.  Not when famed NYC butcher Pat LaFrieda is shipping his monster cuts to the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead right up the street.  My wife got the filet mignon rare with the cold center as always.  She was very satisfied with her steak.  Saving room for the lemon cake is an absolute must.  It was the biggest reason why I worked out before coming here!  One slice is good for four people.    Don't get me wrong.  I won't be bitching and moaning if someone suggests coming here but I've got to put things in perspective.  This isn't the #1 restaurant in Las Vegas.  I'd say it's a top 10 steak in town.  But when you add the terrific service and nice atmosphere you've still got a solid, solid dinner for an evening.",

    "text": "So I know I should review all of the items we tried and frankly there wasn't a single bad item but I will focus on two in more depth because well they are the reason I keep considering daily to catch a quick round trip flight on a Southwest Wanna Get Away fair to have them again!!  Ok so we sat down and ordered up some goodies. We started with the oysters which my friend kindly worked together into a tasty on slurpper that was amazing!! We also had some killer shrimp too. Ok so now on to the two items that stole my heart.  Now we've all had bacon, it's with our breakfast, it's on our burgers and you may even crumble it on a salad or wrap it around a date and you may even have had a slab of pork belly laid nicely on top of a heaping bowl of ramen. If you're fortunate to live in Campbell, CA you may even have had it with the BBB at OCK and tasted the sugary goodness of this porky delight but my friends you have never, and I mean never, had a piece of bacon like this before. Del Friscos does something magical with this bacon. It is crispy, thick, meaty and packed with tons of flavor. We seriously order 6 of these for our table of 6, it was a ridiculous flavor profile. To this day when I see the guys who were at this dinner they all immediately say, \"remember that bacon at Del Frisco's\". It's simply the best menu item I have probably eaten in my life and I've eaten a ton of places and a ton of diverse foods. If I was on death row and I got my one last meal it would probably be a mound of these (I know my mom is upset right now because she probably thought it would be a bowl of her awesome spaghetti and meatballs but sorry ma).   Alright so awesome item number two and though the detail and love affair with this Sin City delight isn't as intense the Tomahawk Bone In Rib Eye still keeps me thinking back to it. Seriously this thing looked like a flippin tennis racket but it did not taste like one my friends. The meat was super tender, moist and cooked to perfection. The portion size was huge and well so was the price tag. But honestly one of the top 3 pieces of meat I've ever eaten. I know people love their steak but if you want a piece cooked to perfection you gotta give a crack to Del Frisco's.   To say the least when I'm back in Vegas for convention season I'm planting my rear at Del Friscos and loading up on bacon and beef!!",

Multiple servers worked our large table, which made things efficient.  They offered great recommendations as well.  Decided to go with the Tomahawk wagyu ribeye ($90) and shared it with another person.  Was definitely enough food for two, especially when you include two sides.  Tasty, moist, and cooked to perfection.  Really a great steak.  I believe it was 32 ounces including the bone, and 22-26oz excluding the bone.    They were also very accommodating when we sent back our old fashions.  Del Frisco's old fashions include club soda  - so unless you like that, it should be noted ahead of time.     In the end, our bachelor got a free slice of cake.  Got to tour the james bond table.  And got some free vouchers for the \"club.\"  The total bill came out to be about $150/person, which includes the steak, sides, and some drinks.  Would definitely recommend this place for any meat connoisseur.",

The waitress was nice to us even though we just ordered icewater-always the sign of good service if they don't get upset when you don't order tip and bill inflating booze. Definitely would go back next time I'm in town.",

Just the way I like it. Also, they served my food on a super hot plate which is a cool thing. I like their wine selection and the ambiance is more enjoyable then other steakhouses since it was lit better...most of these resturants are dimmly lit. Our waitresses were really nice too. Next time I head over to Vegas, I will stop here again.",

Right after check in I immediately found my way back to the Double Eagle Steak House for a feast.  The enviornment was pleasant, the people were very accomdating, and the steak was exceptional.    Although 3/4 of the way through my meal I did notice a small 'hair' in my food that immediately turned my stomach south.  Coincidentally my server just happened to be walking by as I was showcasing my \"yuck-face.\"  She immediatly sprung into action and took the plate away.  After a few short minutes she came back with an apology and free dessert.  Even the floor manager visited my table and informed me the steak would be taken off the tab.  Even though the meal was a bit tarnished at the end, the service made up for it.    Fast forward a few short weeks and I received a Thank-You message from my server Amber in the mail.  It was a hand written note that thanked me for visiting Del Frisco's.  That's personal touch boys and girls!  And I'll be headed there as soon as I can make my way back to Sin City.",

The pricing is good, given it's a high end steakhouse.  A filet + side + beer came out to $60 before tip.  But, compared to the strip, it's about 1/3 less.  SW, a comparable place in the wynn was running $75 JUST for the filet.  so good choice.  I gave 4 out of 5 only because it's off the strip and not super modern inside.  but, again, that's a small point.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews and seeing this place had over 800 reviews with a 4-star plus rating, I figured it had to be amazing.  Well, I stand corrected.  I am torn on whether or not to give it 2 or 3 stars, but went with 2 as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  In fact, for the price, I've experienced A LOT better! We went to the restaurant to try their summer pre fixe menu pairings.  The restaurant was somewhat difficult to locate in the restaurant \"circle\" off Paradise.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by teenage hostesses in fish net stockings.  Not very classy.  We read online that the attire was business casual and we dressed for the occasion, only to find a restaurant full of shorts and t-shirts.  I'm not uppity, and I understand Vegas is by and large casual, but that left something to be desired.  Upon being seated we got a waitress whose appearance was unkempt, and when my fiancee asked a question about the menu she proceeded to start talking over her about the specials of the evening and continue through her spiel.  Upon ordering dinner, I requested a glass of whisky to enjoy with my steak.  The glass of whisky made it out after our meal.  We both ordered our Filet's medium rare, and when they arrived they were more well than rare, and very dry.  The server did request we cut into them to make sure \"they were absolutely perfect\" when they arrived, which was a nice touch.  After much prodding by management, my fiancee agreed to send her steak back for a new one as she didn't want to be a burden or waste food.  The attentiveness was nice, but the steak they brought back the 2nd time (even with my fiancee expressing switch it to \"rare\" instead) was even more cooked than the first.  Let me be clear, the food was not terrible.  However, for the level of reviews this restaurant has, and the prices they command ($200 after tip for the 2 of us), it is hardly 4-star plush worthy.",

So we came here for dinner on one of our Vegas trips and I had high expectations for their steaks.  We started off with a shrimp cocktail, shared a medium rare prime bone-in ribeye, maque choux corn, and creamed spinach.  The shrimp cocktail was good and fresh but a little smaller than what I'm used to seeing so that was a slight disappointment.  As for the steak, it was unfortunately too charred and salty for my taste but I was surprised at how big it was for the price.  The quality of the steak was excellent but it just wasn't seasoned and prepared the way I like.  As for the sides dishes, they were good but not memorable.  I really wanted to like this place based on its excellent reviews and recommendation from my bf's brother in law who I consider as a steak connaisseur, but I've definitely had better.  Service was great and the atmosphere and decor is similar to Mastro's, hence I'm still giving them 3 stars.  Oh ya, don't forget to take a tour of their cigar room.",

Everything was completely first class and the food included the best filet I ever had in a restaurant. I had a reservation and when we walked in there was no hesitation or delay. The led us to our table right away. It was in one of the quieter rooms. The service was impeccable and our waiter explained everything clearly. Even the wine by the glass was first rate. I had a glass of Hess Cabernet and it was superb. Steaks were timely and done exactly as promised. Vegetables and potato are served family style so we only needed one order of asparagus and potatoes for 3 people. The crab cakes were superb also.  It's not cheap, but I would definitely recommend going there again.",

The food is mediocre at best.  The pricing is downright predatory.  The shrimp cocktail tasted stale as if it sat in the fridge all day.  The filet mignon was tough and was overcooked and overseasoned.  The mixed drinks were weak.  The wine list does not offer an adequate international selection.  They gouge you on the bill.  The prices are high enough, and we would have not minded paying if the quality matched.  They even charged for the bernaise sauce for my filet!  There is a reason that this place does not come up on the top lists for Las Vegas on Zagats etc...  Spend your money elsewhere.",

I mentioned the anniversary when I made the reservation, and there was a card signed by the staff at our table, nice touch. Travis was our server. He was great. He knew the food he was serving, and described it well. Atmosphere was good, dimly lit, and everyone engaging in quiet conversation. We started with the fried calamari, thai style, which is served with a spicy chili sauce on top. It was good good good, yum. For our entrees I went with the Bone-in Ribeye, and my wife went with the Lamb Chops. They were both cooked perfectly to our request, med. rare for my ribeye, and med. rare for my wife's lamb chops. My steak was juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned. You can see the marbling throughout the steak, which makes their steaks so delicious. My wife enjoyed her lamb chops as did I, ha. Yes we tasted each others dinners. We ordered the cream spinach with bacon and lobster mac n cheese as our sides, and they were delicious. We ended with the lemon cake and they comped it for our anniversary, another nice touch. We will for sure be back next time we are in Vegas. While we were there the staff let us know they just opened a new Del Friscoes in Los Angeles by the Santa Monica pier. Guess where we're going bebe?!!!",

    "text": "What started out as a good dining experience ended on a great dining experience. We were in Vegas for a poker tournament and decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. This place had great reviews so we wanted to give it a try. Our waiter was nice enough but seemed to start getting impatient with us when we asked questions about the menu. However, the manager made up for it with her very friendly and open and personable demeanor. I was a bit weirded out as to why the swanky establishment would allow a patron to bring in a dog on a leash that was not a service dog, but whatever. One of the staff members walked by and said, \"Well the 'dog' orders expensive wine.\" Yeah, sure he does. I did drop my jaw to the floor when the patron ordered ice water for her dog. Anyway, I digress with an anecdote. The steak was good but the Del's Uptown potato was out of this world! I'm glad we were able to substitute that on the $59 menu (even though the waiter seemed put out that we asked if we could) because that really made the difference. Mmmm, mmmm!  Now onto the reason for the great dining experience. As we were leaving, I needed to make a stop into the ladies room. I heard music being played but I thought it was music being piped in from satellite radio. However, when I got back, my boyfriend pointed out that it was a piano player in the lounge. We ended up staying for an additional hour and a half just to listen to Tyrone at the bar! What a fun evening! He played requests for us. He chatted with us. We laughed, we sang. Wow! I did hear that once they remodel in July, he will no longer be around after that. So, if you're in the area, go and see him before he's gone! He's the best!  So again, food pretty good (potato even better). Service, good (but made up for by the manager). Entertainment - out of this world! Overall dining experience, \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"",

We ordered the long born steak with was aged for I believe 25-28 days and ordered it medium rare (we usually order medium but plate is super hot so it keeps cooking) I couldn't believe how soft the meat was! It literally melted in my mouth!!! The lobster was very basic but oh so meaty!!! The atmosphere was ok. I personally like the atmosphere at the Morton's in Las Vegas much more. For being a more expensive steakhouse a lot of people were dressed extra casual. The only reason I took off a star is because we still had food left over and we had like 7 different staff members try to take our food away without even asking if we were done! Like that steak was Over $100 can we please enjoy it without being rushed!!! Besides this our waitress was nice and gave us great service otherwise I would've knocked some stars down. Overall I would recommend! But pay attention to the staff when the get near your food!!!",

It as just ok for me  Bone in filet - loved the tenderness, cooked perfectly as requested. Seasoned well  Dry aged rib eye - husband loved it. Cooked perfectly aswell as requested.  Creamed corn - not too fond of it. Certain seasoning me & my husband didn't like. Prolly cumin? Idk  Lobster mash potato - really good. Only comment about this is its a chunky mash potato, but some chunks where too big that it could be eaten w 4 bites. So it wasnt like the usual smooth mash potato  Asparagus - cooked well, not overcooked  We were impressed w the steaks but not so much the sides. Reason for 5 stars because mainly for Ro.   Great job! Keep it up!",

Let me preface this by saying, the service was BEYOND exceptional. Zayne was just ONE of our three serves. Our table was visited by management at least 4 times. Everyone was conversations with us and really making the service exceptional.   We started with escargot. It was delicious and most importantly, different. It was served with fresh tomato and garlic wine sauce. Then we had the seafood platter. Ice cold. Fresh. Fantastic. Except one extremely small complaint: the seafood is cracked for you and so I had pieces of shell that kept making their way into my mouth. But this is a first world problem and I'm almost embarrassed to mention it.   For steaks we had: ribeye, bone in New York, and of course the Tomahawk. They were all cooked to perfection. Piping hot plates and full of FLAVOR. We got the spinach, mushrooms and potatoes at gratin for sides. All excellent with, again, lots of flavor. The spinach had bacon. The mushrooms had caramelized onions. Not your average steakhouse sides. They had \"flare\".   Now, dessert. The entire restaurant knew how we were celebrating multiple occasions and apparently, so did the staff because we had a platter full of dessert. Not just one dessert, but pretty much every dessert on the menu. Management, wait staff, sommelier, and our food runner all came to the table to celebrate with us.   This was a fantastic experience and we will, without a doubt, be back!",

Our assortment of appetizers was just to die for-Calamari, foie gras, and this bourbon bacon. Our entries varied from Filets to Tomahawks to seafood and no one was disappointed. They do an above and beyond explanation of the menu and difference in steaks. Sides I was so happy because they are family style so we all got a lot of everything. The Lobster Mac was my favorite.   Extensive wine list with knowledgeable staff. Wonderful bartender too!  We were too full for dessert but I am sure it would of been amazing.",

When I called to make a reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything, so I told them it was my boyfriend's birthday. (Yes, it actually was.)  They gave him a card at the beginning signed by the staff, and then they brought out 2 desserts on a plate for us at the end of the meal!  The food was FANTASTIC. Best lobster I've ever had, and of course the 45-day aged ribeye was exactly as it sounds - like the best thing you've ever eaten. Lobster Mac was to die for.  I think my favorite thing about this place was how much time each of the staff members spent with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and happy. They talked with us, laughed with us, and I noticed the other servers were doing the same for their tables.  We had Sean. He was so delightful.  Eat here for an experience you'll always remember!",

    "text": "My husband and I came here to celebrate our 1 year marriage anniversary while we were visiting Las Vegas. Many locals we ran into in Vegas warned us of our decision to go to this steak house, but I have to say they were all wrong.  Del Frisco's provided first class service, went above and beyond for our anniversary, and the food was incredible.  From the moment we checked in, the hostess greeted us and remembered from when we made reservations that it was our anniversary.  When we were seated, the table had flower petals and there was a card signed by the staff.   I don't have the card in front of me, so please forgive me if I get our waitress' name wrong but I believe she went by \"Jack\". She was such a delight! Her suggestions on what to order were perfect and she handled everything in a very timely manner.   We had the Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, Wagyu Steak Tomahawk Chop, Creamed Spinach, and the Uptown Del's Potatoes. Everything was insanely good, splurge on the steak because it's definitely worth it.  For dessert they brought us out a free tasting of their Butter Cake and Chocolate Souffle Cake. Skip the souffle and just order a million servings of the Butter Cake, this was probably the best dessert I've ever tasted. We were beyond stuffed but could not leave a bite of this left on the plate!  Thank you Del Frisco's for making our anniversary so special! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!",

BEWARE IF THE A5 WAGU!    4 of us at the table decided to splurge and go for the A5 wagu. 3 of us had the wagu  sampling/tasting dinner. 1 of went with a 9 oz. A5 wagu from Japan. All of the wagu dishes were terrible.   They were served very thinly sliced and raw and stone cold. I mean cold. The bread was warmer than the wagu.  Seriously, it was like eating carpaccio or wagu sashimi. 3 of the 4 wagu dishes were sent back to be cooked (and warmed) a little more. $160 - $180  for a few slices of cold, raw, thinly sliced wagu beef. The saving grace here was the service. Our waiter and the wait staff was terrific. I prefer Craft Steak or The Cut when in Vegas.  I don't think i will be returning to Del Frisco's.",

Stepping into this place, you get a very classy, yet relaxed atmosphere. That's very rare to have...as an experience! Normally it can't be both, just one or the other.   Service was outstanding. Forgot our waiters name, but he was very personable and he was always hovering around to make sure everything was straight.  Definitely get the rib eye, medium rare!!

    "text": "Absolutely amazing. I am a huge steak lover and this was the first steakhouse in Vegas that did not disappoint me. Service was flawless. I actually got a waiter that knew what he was talking about and had some common sense, something a lot of waiters lack.   For food, I ordered the 12 oz filet and it was perfect. The hot plate they serve it on kept the initially sizzling steak hot and warm until I finished it. Other steakhouses serve steaks on hot plates as well, but even still, I always find the steak to cool down quickly. Thankfully, it's not a problem here.  The complimentary bread is pretty meh in my opinion. It tastes fresh but it's not the type of bread I prefer. After eating at Mortons so many times, my standard for steakhouse bread has not been able to be satisfied by other places thus far.  For other sides and apps, I got baked potato, gumbo soup, and the crab cake. The crab cake is incredible, definitely worth a try. Baked potato is good but the butter is not the kind of butter I prefer. The gumbo soup was kind of bland and dissatisfying, something I probably won't get next time.  Overall, my experience at Del Frisco's was amazing and I highly recommend it. The steak was so good!!!!!!",

    "text": "Went to this place as a group dinner (for bachelor party).   Parking is valet or a private lot. We took a limo there so not sure how much valet is. It's a pretty big restaurant, i think the capacity was around 500. Hosts/Hostesses were polite and courteous. They also have a pianist playing in the main lobby area. Decor is just nice. Nothing too crazy or fancy but just fancy & nice enough.   We got the 32 Oz Wagyu beef for the groom and rest of us got the Prie-Fix menu with the 16 oz upgrade (Prie fix was 49 and you add $12-15 more for the upgrade, not a bad deal if you love meat). We all got different side items (creamed spinach, corn, crab cakes, shrimps, lemon garlic scallops). Crab cakes were delicious as mentioned by other reviews. I liked the scallops and the creamed spinach. I don't think the mashed potatoes were that great but some of my friends seemed to really enjoy them.   The Meat, obviously is the main focus of this place (being a steak house). All the meats were cooked real well. It was seasoned well and the the portion size is pretty damn huge so come hungry and ready to devour. I had a hard time finishing my plate. Service was impeccable as our waters were constantly being re-filled and tables being cleaned.   It is definitely on the pricey side so I'd recommend coming here for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Not worth the time & money.  The only thing that's good is their signature, pineapple cocktail drink.  I got the off menu wagyu and I can definitely say it wasn't a prime wagyu; taste & texture is completely different; don't even bother trying.   Got their maque choix corn & the crab cake.  If you've tasted Mastro's cream corn, then you will be disappointed with this maque choix corn.  Unfortunately, I haven't tasted crab cakes that makes me want more, this crab cake wasn't any different.  My significant other tasted my wagyu & said, \"i taste only charcoal.\"  He was right, but I think it was just the slice he tasted that was more burnt.  The customer service was definitely a 5-star, hostess & waitress were friendly.  I'll probably come by here for the pineapple cocktail & to be in a little more classier environment, away from the drunkards.",

    "text": "Wow the 2nd best steak I've ever had.  Only behind the great Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa.  This is a bad thing, because I will never come to Vegas again without eating here.  A truly great steak is something special that you don't take for granted.  Once again folks get off the strip, and explore some of the best restaurants in town without the celebrity chef's name attached to it.  I've had Del Frisco's bookmarked for a while now and the only thing that kept me away is that I found out it was a chain, so how good can it be?  There are lots of Prime Steakhouse chains and while they are all pretty good, they aren't really that special.  Well this chain is small, only 10 locations.  I hope they keep it that way to keep up the quality.  We decided to really give the place a try and went with their signature special steaks.  The 32 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Bone in Rib Eye ($90), The 16 oz Bone in Filet Mignon ($60), and the Filet Mignon 3 ways ($60).  The 32 oz Wagyu just melted in your mouth.  I'm not usually a Rib Eye fan, but the marbling on the Wagyu is a beautiful thing.  I love steaks medium rare with a warm red center.  Our excellent server Tatyana, told us that the chef recommended going one degree more and ordering medium.  This way the excess marbling has a change to \"melt\" into the beef as it cooks.  I read a few reviews, that complained about this steak being too fatty.  I'm guessing they didn't take the chef's advice.  When cooked properly a Wagyu steak's fat content has a wonderful texture to it that just blends perfectly with a beef.  This steak was pure heaven and like I said, the 2nd best steak I've ever eaten.  Yes it's expensive but, at 32 oz, big enough to share with others.  I would share this steak, before going with one of their regular steaks.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#QnGNcJnSUIKmtRx5-D5fOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  The 16 oz bone in Filet Mignon, isn't one of their regular steaks.  It's a much higher quality Filet than the other steaks on the menu.  Again splurge for this steak or you are missing what makes Del Frisco's special.  Served right on the tail of the Porterhouse bone, it's awesome and you are getting a large filet as they don't waste too much of the weight with the bone.  It pairs very well with the Wagyu and you will be happy going back and forth between them. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#uUtykR97bd0p9_sMrBSkQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  The Filet Trio, while nice, seemed fairly ordinary compared to the other two steaks.  The steak quality here was similar to other prime steakhouses, but were seasoned a little more boldly.  My favorite of the 3, was the Brie Filet.  Melt Brie on anything and it's a hit.  The Huge Broiled Shrimp was slightly over cooked, and the oscar while ok, wasn't to the level of the steak it's self. Each was a good size 4oz filet.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#7NRMtJHyxBEUaJLC7EB-QQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  If you want insurance that your steak will be special, order a side of the truffle butter.  This is melted table side and is amazing.  It isn't needed for the Wagyu or Bone in Filet, but a few bites here and there didn't hurt.  It definitely brought the Filet trio up to another level, as well as the Potato Wedges that came with my daughter's cheeseburger. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#0pPPADGYUQ0GMgvAZjKMKg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  Speaking of the cheeseburger, it's prime ground beef and was well seasoned.  If you are in Vegas for a few days, it wouldn't be wrong to come back and sit at the bar and enjoy this big burger with a few tasty sides. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#PxzVgtdoc2OMmXJMGWB2mQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  Of the 3 side dishes we shared, the Potatoes Au Gratin were the only one that really stood out.  So cheesy with a nice strong cheddar and perfectly cooked cubed potatoes.  It was everything the Lobster Mac & Cheese should have been.  Not cheesy at all and more like a Lobster Mac & Bechamel, pretty bland.  The Mushrooms nothing special either.  Read way too many reviews not to share a slice of the 6 layer lemon cake with buttercream frosting.  It's big enough to share with a few people for sure.  Very moist and along with a dessert wine could be a great ending to a special meal. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#H2gQ4_Ti4oHafcxn3UH3lw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  If you are a steak lover, make sure you bump Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House high up on your to do list.

Half our party sawed off the seared parts and only ate that. Not a good thing if, you know, you go to the steak house for the actual steak.  Service, salads, lobster mac n cheese, oysters, even creamed spinach were all amazing. Great wine selection, too. But those darn undercooked, gristly steaks! And the bathroom is tiny for such a large restaurant. Even the men's room had a long line at times (3-4 people waiting.)",

    "text": "Had a reservation for 7 hungry men after a long day at the beach club.  I'll be honest.  I think most high-end steak houses are the same.  I truly believe that what separates them are the sides and appetizers, so I'll start there.  Probably the best crab cake I've ever had.  It was basically an enormous lump of crab with just enough consistency to keep it in 'cake' form.  The sauce that came with the cake was absolutely phenomenal.  Lobster mac and cheese was equally incredible.  The asparagus was rather plain.  It appeared to be simply steamed without much to it.  I prefer mine with oil and garlic.  The creamed spinach is good, but the same as you'd find at other steak houses, although the addition of bacon is a pretty nice touch.  I'm rather used to having porterhouses for 2 (or 3 or 4, etc), so I decided to have the porterhouse for 1.  Perhaps I've gotten spoiled but I've gotten so used to seeing my porterhouse sliced up that having to do it on my own really felt like a chore.  Call me a baby in a grown man's body.  Otherwise, the steak was cooked perfectly, and had a nice progression of rare-ness as I got closer to the bone.  By the end of the night, I was eating with my hands and the bone was cleaner than what a dog would have done.  The other guys I were with seemed to enjoy theirs as well.  We all had been drinking all day, attempted to sober up for a few hours, and so no one wanted to see or smell a drink during our meal.  Overall this actually really saved us on the bill and our fine meal hardly broke the bank.  As for the service, our server Ryan was excellent and we enjoyed the banter, while our sides were plated for us very nicely by the rest of his crew.",

This most recent trip for a birthday celebration was really nothing short of great. I even actually opted for seafood this night over red meat.. long week of t-bones and lamb.. haha.. random week.. but anyway.   The quality of the food is fantastic. The service was spot on without being pretentious or rude, and the overall experience was really pretty wonderful. The staff really made us feel great.. and made every effort to keep our drinks full, bread basket overflowing and meals served promptly.   Seriously, i can say nothing else other than it's also pretty fantastic that they are located off-Strip and thus, requires that you do not have to deal with a huge parking garage. While they have valet available, the parking lot is like 50 feet from the front door if you want to just walk.   I will be back.. again and again.",

    "text": "EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE  My boyfriend and I came here on our first date six months ago.  It was a wonderful dinner and our waitress, Priscilla, and the rest of the Del Frisco staff outdid themselves that night.  They were incredibly attentive and the food was delicious, especially the lobster mac & cheese.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#hrid:1Cziker169quEYeflq99GA\">yelp.com/biz/del-friscos...</a>  For our six-month anniversary, we returned to the scene of the crime.  Unfortunately, Priscilla was on maternity leave.  How did we know that?  Because when Mel called to make the reservation, he was informed of that fact.  How did they know that Priscilla was our waitress? They must have a file on every customer and keep notes!  Whatever it is, I'm impressed.  When we showed up for dinner and checked in, guess what?  The hostess told us that Priscilla was on maternity leave-hah!  We know, but thank you.  We were shown to our table and a gentleman took our drink order and told us that Liz would be our waitress that evening. Liz showed up and told us that Priscilla was on maternity leave with her son.  By now, this would be considered to be kind of weird, but we were impressed that the staff of this establishment went to such lengths to make sure that we were taken care of.  Note, we'd only been here ONCE before. Needless to say, Liz took great care of us.  The manager stopped by our table to greet us.  No less than 3 different staff members filled water glasses, brought entrees and side dishes.  A big plus to the staff member who brought us our steaks and requested that we cut into them to ensure that they were cooked to our liking before he left the table--that was a first for me and I'm even more impressed.  I had the beef medallions, 3 pieces of steak served over mashed potatoes with green beans.  I could only eat two of the medallions because we started with the sesame bread and butter as well as Del's salad for me, plus lobster mac & cheese on the side.  Mel had the filet mignon with mushrooms on the side.  It was a lot of food, but we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here once again.  Another big plus is the cool piano player who plunked out some nice tunes, including one of my faves, \"The Girl from Ipanema.\"  I was a happy woman that night and we will definitely be back after another wonderful dining experience at Del Frisco's.  I've never had such great customer service and it didn't stop that night.  Mel received a follow-up e-mail the next day to thank us for our business; incredible.",

    "text": "This is my favorite place to dine in Las Vegas when I want to escape the Sin City madness. I've enjoyed my visits here tremendously, whether it was for a buddy's \"final meal\" as a bachelor or a quiet date night with my wife.   The Del Frisco's rib eye steak is beyond amazing. This is how a steak should be served: it should be the star of the meal, not hidden under sauces or overwhelmed with superfluous flavors. It's a high quality, 16 ounce cut of rib-eye that's cooked to perfection, with a crust that complements the juicy tenderness of the meat.   Your server will warn you that they undercook their steaks a bit, so if you normally order medium rare, then you'll order medium. They'll have you cut your steak to ensure it's been cooked to your liking. Steak lovers know that if you're at a high-end steakhouse like Del Frisco's, then you're wasting your money if you're ordering a steak well done, since you want to taste the meat, not the flame.   The appetizers are spectacular. When they're in season, the stone crab claws are delicious. Fresh and meaty, they're the perfect starter and contrast nicely with the meat feast you're about to indulge in. The calamari is also tasty, with an Asian-style twist to them. My favorite, though, is the crab cake: It's heavy on the crab and easy on the breading. The sauce might be too rich for some tastes, but during my most recent visit, the waitress saw me dunking my bread into it and she brought out a side of the sauce so I could enjoy a few extra dunks before the main course. Now that's service!  Speaking of, the service is top notch. I love how each server manages to be available without being intrusive. Every staff member I've encountered has been polite, friendly, and attentive.  Finally, the sides are served family-style, so one order is good for two or three people. My favorites are the sauteed mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, and the lobster mac and cheese. Each is a worthy complement to your steak.  Bring at least $100 per person for food, more if you'll be having drinks. After a meal at Del Frisco's, I always stay away from steak for a month or two: it's so good that everything else pales in comparison.   Highly recommended. Be sure to ask about the James Bond table before or after your meal.",

We were celebrating our 30th Wedding Anniversary & the entire staff made sure it was special. Brege, our waitress, was just the right amount of attentive & lots of fun. We thoroughly enjoyed chatting with her! We also would 100% recommend the Butter Cake. Absolutely incredible!! I'm not a cake fan but this is the exception. Phenomenal!  Thank you to the entire staff. Every person we encountered congratulated us & wished us well, making it even more special. Thank you to all & especially to Brege!",

Don't you hate when you are having a an intimate conversation on a romantic night with your significant other and some jerk interrupts the moment to pour water or ask you if you would like more bread. Well not here, you don't even notice that everything is meticulously topped off. Now on to the food. Bread was like an airy pillow of greatness  Crab cake #1 of all time. Oyster from the eat coast excellent. Wedge salad a perfect ratio of blue cheese to bacon and lettuce. Salmon was perfectly presented and prepared. Filet trio, each piece topped with a special kick, Lump crab, Shrimp and Scallop wrapped with bacon, Brie cheese and all cooked to the perfect temperature. 7 layer lemon cake was amazing. In a city with so many choice you should take a short trip from the strip chaos and experience a True jackpot. Thank You for your contribution on making this a spectacular birthday for my wife.",

They spilled something on me because it was my fault and they offered to dry clean my shirt and purchase me a new one. They serve Voss water and have a full bar. Can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Off the strip, quiet, and I highly recommend!",

    "text": "Not sure why this place has so many stars.  Here is our honest review:  -- There were literally 3 different types of music going AT ONCE, and we could hear them all mixed together.  I know this sounds absurd.  It was!  I'm including a video that proves this cacophony.  I've NEVER heard anything this horrible in any restaurant, ever.  Oh, and the types of music going were more suited for some hill-billy joint or cafe, rather than a good restaurant.  And, I'm not being snobby -- I've been to many nice restaurants that play easy-going music, or rock music, or jazz....    -- I ordered an \"old fashioned\" (drink).  The glass it came in was hideous, unrefined.  The drink itself was just OK.  See the picture of the drink.  I do realize this is a matter of taste -- it's just that I've had these drinks in dozens of different fine restaurants, and this glass looks like it came from a thrift shop, or from grandma's cupboard.  -- We shared a steak.  Rather than them garnishing the additional plate, it was bare.  I know this might be the norm of SOME places, but we've been to so many places where they do a little embellishment.  It's not McDonalds or Wendy's, after all, is it.  -- Lobster Mac & Cheese:  Sounds like a dream, right?  Well, I'm a big lobster eater, as well as chef of seafood (most of it I catch myself), and I've caught my own lobsters, as well.  Anyone out there know what happens when you freeze fish, then thaw it, then freeze it AGAIN?  It turns spongy.  If you know what I mean, then you know how the lobster pieces were in this lobster mac & cheese.  They were horrible.  I couldn't even eat it.  On the other hand, if you don't know what I'm talking about, then I guess you aren't that experienced with good seafood, and you probably would be fooled.  I'm not trying to offend anyone by saying this; just being honest & objective.  -- Server -- Was not refined.  Did not provide the type of service we find so standard in a \"nicer\" restaurant.  Was sloppy and was also hard to understand what he was saying.  -- T.V. playing sports -- a huge T.V. was blasting sports above the bar.  Sure, this is pretty normal in places. I get it.  But, the way it was situated, it could be seen from the \"dining room.\"  It really helped ruin the atmosphere.  Most \"nicer restaurants\" don't even bother with a T.V.; if they do, it's usually in the bar area, and there are seating options away from it.  -- Not a \"good restaurant\" environment, in general.  I know, this is an \"opinion.\"  But, for evidence, I present another picture showing chairs all stacked up outside the bathroom door.  Sloppy!",

Here at Las Vegas location too much black pepper on everything ! Someone tell the chef you cannot replace taste with black pepper. Re quested Bearnaise sauce for the 12 ounce bone in filet. It was cold. Asked for warm and came back with another cold batch. Three times cold batches of the sauce. I cannot tell you that 15 minutes later I am starting at a filet that's cold. Sorry we are at a private business with 10 persons and a hefty tab. Three other persons had their filets returned for being cooked wrong. Not coming back. I give it 2 stars because wait staff did not cook the food. It's not their fault. Wish I had a better experience. Love the NYC location!!",

    "text": "This is one classy joint and the meals there will not disappoint.  For appetizers we ordered Oysters on a Half Shell. This was my first time eating raw oysters on a half shell, I was a tad hesitant at first, but I read about them and was excited to try them.  When the oysters came out to the table they had 3 different choices of sauces to douse your oysters with: One sauce contained red wine vinegar with chopped onions, 2nd a cocktail sauce, and side of freshly grated horseradish, of course a wedge of lemon.    The first oyster I partook in, I only added the lemon juice and horseradish. With little hesitation I shucked the oyster in my mouth the cold, slippery mollusk hit my tongue like a wave from the ocean. I slightly chewed and swallowed, I LOVED IT!  The next Oyster I ate, I put some of the vinegar sauce on it, as well as some cocktail and horseradish, and a splash of lemon juice.  This oyster was slightly bigger and different than the one I had prior, I think this was from the east coast.  Anyway, I shucked it, chewed it, and swallowed.  This was so delicious, It was almost like tasting the sea breeze, and the after taste was of melon. Kind of like the taste of a watermelon rind. I was shocked to have tasted this, because I wasn't sure my taste buds were to detect it.  For dinner I  ordered the 16 oz Prime Strip.  My friends ordered one 16 oz Lobster, and the fish of the day which was Flounder.  As for the sides: Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin, and Asparagus.  The waitstaff serve you each individually asking if you would like each side, and they place the sides on your plate at the table.  They melt the butter for your lobster at the table as well.  The prime strip melted in my mouth, so tender and juicy, I didn't need any sauces or anything, It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The waitstaff waited for us to take the first bite and asked if everything was prepared to our liking before leaving the table.  The side dishes were out of this world! My favorite was the lobster macaroni and cheese.  It was so delicate and delicious.  The flavors all combined perfectly and was unlike any other macaroni and cheese I had eaten before.  The asparagus was crunchy and fresh, lightly salted with almonds and olive oil.  The potatoes au gratin were cheesy and creamy, definitely one of the best sides to have with a nice juicy steak.  I tasted my friends flounder with couscous, it was so fresh and flaked off in your mouth like it was meant to be there all along.  You cannot forget the mouth watering Lobster tail that my other friend had.  So juicy and meaty. The butter paired with it so well, it was like a velvety blanket of love.  For dessert the brought out a 7 layer lemon cake for my birthday! The most moist cake I have ever eaten. My taste buds were in heaven and I couldn't believe all the wonderful things I was tasting!  I cannot wait to go back to Del Frisco's again!  BTW order a lemon drop martini, they are amazing there.",

    "text": "Vegas isn't Vegas without having a piece of meat. You know what I'm saying, steak! Dirty minded people! I knew what you were thinking. This location is located off the strip a few blocks from the Wynn. Del Frisco's is part of a restaurant group located around the country. Though this Las Vegas location is nice, their Manhattan restaurant has no comparison. Like most steakhouses, this resturant is lighted dimmed with wood panelled walls and vaulted ceilings. A bar area is accompanied by a piano man signing and playing classic R & B tunes from the early 80's which gives this place a great setting for dinner.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine. They sold us on ordering a pitcher of pineapple infused vodka they called The VIP which was $60. I suggest trying it first individually, unless you really like it. The vodka they used was Svedka which I later found out is $10/bottle vodka which is \"not so VIP\".  I ordered a Del Frisco salad wich came with thick smoked bacon. That was delicious. For the main course, I ordered the 8oz filled served medium rare with lump crab cake. Truffle butter was served over a warming candle for dipping. Steak was perfect and the crab cake was memorable. For sides, we shared cream corn, cream spinach, and mushrooms which were all fairly good. The house potatoes were just okay. Dessert was good to but nothing outstanding or extra-ordinary. I had the chocolate soufle with vanila ice cream.  I came out of the restaurant ready to explode. The steak quality here is very good.  Service like at most Vegas restaurants was outstanding. I look forward to come back again to enjoy a piece of meat in Vegas. I meant STEAK!",

    "text": "I want to start out by saying that this place has the best customer service.  They really take care of you here and make you feel special.  Treating the customer well is a dying art and these guys are top notch.  I have been here 3 times now and each time I have had a pleasant experience.  I used to go to Carnevino, but they are hit and miss with their service.      The first time I came here, it was because I couldn't make a reservation for one at Carnevino.  I looked for another steak house and came across this place.  I am sure glad I found this place.  I was treated very well and the food was outstanding. I don't remember the server's name, but he treated me as if I was his friend.  The friendliness and good food made me feel like I couldn't wait to visit again.  The second time I ate here was in August 2016 for my birthday.  I suggested this place to my bros and they were willing to try it.  When we made the reservations, we included in the notes that we were celebrating a birthday.  As we got sat to our table they gave me a birthday card signed by some of the staff.  Throughout the night I was wished a happy birthday from others on the staff.  We had the best service from Jason and Gavin.  They were like the dynamic duo (they can fight over who was Batman and who was Robin, lol).  They were very attentive to us and knowledgeable of everything.  They also treated us like we were all friends.  They made some awesome suggestions too.  They really make you feel welcomed there.  I wish more places or people were like that.  The third time I ate here was in October 2016.  My wife and I came to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary, our son also joined us.  When I made reservations I included in the notes that we were celebrating an anniversary.  As we were sat down at our table, we got a card wishing us a happy anniversary signed by some of the staff members.  We were sat in the old cigar room, back when they allowed smoking in an eating establishment.  They still have a humidor and you can still buy cigars.  The cigar prices are very reasonable.  Our server Gavin walked up and immediately recognized me from the last time I was there.  He said, \"Hey don't I know you?\"  I told him that I was there two months ago and he said he remembered that.  He also remembered what I ordered.  That in itself was amazing to me, to remember me and what I ordered 2 months later.   Then Jason walked in and he said the same thing.  These two guys are amazing and awesome people.  They took good care of us and was again attentive and knowledgeable.  The way we were treated by them, in itself is a reason I would come back here.  I have had two different cuts of steak out of the three times I have been here.  I had the Wagyu Tomahawk Chop 32 oz twice.  Both times my steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Anyone who gets a steak cooked past medium, might as well go get a diner steak.  At that point they all taste the same.  I had my steak accompanied by their truffle butter.  They use a candle underneath to make sure the butter is melted throughout your meal.  Although the steak does not need the butter, it really complimented it.  I have been to many steak houses and this by far has been one of the best.  I also had the Bone-In Ribeye 22 oz and of course, it was just as good.   Based on the amazing service I have had here, I will keep coming back.  The awesome food was icing on the cake.  They have valet parking, but you might as well park yourself.  They have a bar and someone who plays piano.  Everyone here is very friendly and make it worth coming here.",

I ordered the 16oz bone in ribeye steak and ask for medium rare. While the wife ask for the beef medallions. Started with the free bread which was a sesame white loaf. It was nice and soft and warm.   When the entrees came out they had me cut the steak to make sure it was done right and it was perfect. The steak was so tender when I tasted it and also very flavorful. My wife beef medallions in her words was marvelous. Hadn't tasted any beef this good.   For dessert we had the five layer cake which was a huge slice. And it went perfect with my coffee. Service was great and the ambience was very relaxing.   If your looking for a great steak in Vegas.

One of them was ordered a prime aged ribeye and was served a prime strip steak and when asked to switch to a ribeye the server insisted it was correct. We had a ribeye on the table to compare it with and from experience knew it wasn't a ribeye. The second thing was spending 170 dollars on two lobster tails that were tough and not fresh. 600 is way to much to spend for not getting correct food delivered.",

    "text": "Thank you, Yelpers, for your awesome reviews and helping us to figure out where we were eating for my birthday on a Saturday night!  SIde note: The $$$$ is not accurate. Guy Savoie and Ruth's Chris are a $$$$, Del Frisco's is more like a $$$. I was prepared to be overwhelmed by the prices but the menu is very reasonable, especially considering the high quality and portions of the food.  Del Frisco's is a steakhouse located off the strip but conveniently located within minutes of the strip hotels. We made our reservation through Yelp and were seated as soon as we arrived. The hostesses and servers are friendly and a nice change from some of the staff who work in LV. Del Frisco's is classy without being pretentious.  We started off with the Crab Cake in cajun lobster sauce and let me just tell you that you have to have one!  The crab is fresh and free of that fishy taste that you sometimes get in other restaurants (yeah, I'm talking about you, Bouchon!). The cajun sauce is liquid heaven and I raved about it so much that our server, Travis, was so sweet and brought us a ramekin of it to dip our bread in.  Next we had a Caesar Salad and a Chopped Salad. They were average but tasty.  In order to save room for dessert we split their off menu Trio of Filet's. These were delicious! You get three 4 oz filets, each prepared a different way. The first is Oscar-style and has lump crab with bernaise sauce. The second was served with scallops and shrimp. The third filet was served with melted brie cheese on top. So yummy! All were cooked perfectly with a lovely sear on the outside but melt in your mouth delicious on the inside.  For our sides we ordered the Lobster mac n cheese and the Green Beans. I'm so sad that we weren't going right back to our hotel or we would have taken the leftovers home. The mac n cheese was cheesy heaven!  Since it was my birthday they brought us a GIANT slice of their New Orleans-style lemon cake. Sweet, moist and delicious!    The service was friendly and they were so good about keeping our water glasses filled and brought us fresh, hot bread as soon as we finished the first loaf. Our server, Travis, was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate through our different options. We were very happy with all of the food and their unique ways of preparing it.   The valet staff arranged for a taxi to take us clubbing so it was a great experience all the way around!  Del Frisco's, we'll be back!",

After the 5th person in our family ordered a steak, the waitress told us that \"oh, I forgot--we are out of steaks tonight\".  Out of steaks??  So we called Del Frisco's who said if you can be here by 11PM, we will take care of you.  Well, the 8 of us got to Del Frisco's with about 7 minutes to spare.  I have to say it was the most wonderful time my family has ever had.  The people who waited on us never rushed us, and we were there until 2:30 in the morning.  The food was outstanding; steaks melted in our mouths and the sides were ordered were perfection.  The manager treated each of us to sample each of the desserts they had that night.  The James Bond table was great!  Our custom made bar now has the saying that Del Frisco's has on their bar \"Do right and fear no man\".  My family still talks about the wonderful time; service and food we had at Del Frisco's.  Expensive--yes but well worth the price. I would recommend this steak house to anybody wanting a great experience.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas this past weekend for a girlfriend's bacherloette party.  She wanted have a nice dinner so one of the girls planned and reserved Friday night at this steakhouse for the 7 of us.  We actually arrived 1/2 an hour late, but called them and they were ok with it.  Once we arrived, we were seated immediately and the hostess was so gracious and professional.   Once we were seated, we ordered a pitcher of their special drink (vodka infused with pineapple juice), really good and I would definitely recommend this. Steaks are usually too big for me since I'm small so I decided to split with my sister and we all shared different sides.  We ordered: - Porterhouse - medium rare - this was so delicious and the cut and cook was perfect for the both of us to share.  It was tender and juicy and one of my favorite cuts now.  - mushrooms - really juicy and enough to share for the 7 of us, they brought out extras just in case - creamed spinach - this was my least favorite, it was a bit on the salty side so I barely touched it - broccoli - this was simple steamed broccoli with butter - mashed potatoes - this was my favorite side, it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it.  We all loved it.  We had so much fun and enjoyed our food here.  The ambiance is wonderful and the staff was a lot of fun and made us feel welcomed.  I heard they are opening one in Irvine, CA, so I will try that location the next time I come visit.",

It was so tasty, tender, and juicy.  My boyfriend ordered some seafood platter thing. He really enjoyed it. I'm actually surprised he finished it. There was so much seafood!   And the table next to ours ordered the onion rings...I need to know what kind of onions those were from. Those rings were huge! I mean, probably the size of my neck! They were like genetically altered or something. Maybe they were on steroids?  Like dessert? Try their white chocolate creme brulee and strawberry romanoff :) delicious.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm most definitely eating here. That's all I could think about when we got back home from our trip!!! DEL FRISCO'S STEAK, I NEED YOU!!!!!!! :) drool.",

    "text": "MOST AMAZING STEAKHOUSE EVER!  Yup, it's True! Del Frisco's is an amazing steakhouse!! They're located off the strip, but it's only about a five minute drive by taxi and is well worth the trip and the money spent to get to this restaurant.    Our party of eight was seated in what seemed like our own private room. We were tucked away in the corner and we couldn't even hear the people at the table closest to us. Score!!  Service here is spot on. Our server was very friendly and helpful. She recommended certain foods and was attentive to our needs and wants for our meal, both food and drink. The staff who brought out our food and the bartenders were also amazing as well. I love how they worked as a team to make sure that all the people in our party were taken care of and got what they needed.   I ordered the Filet Mignon. It was PERFECT. So good!! I'd highly recommend this steak. As a table, we ordered some sides as well. I tried the Lobster Mac N Cheese (AMAZING!!) and the Mushrooms (so GOOD). The rest of my table seemed to love their meals as well.   For drinks, we all got a shot of Fireball Whiskey (strong, but good). I got a Margaritini, which is a combination of a Martini and a Margarita. Sounds weird, but it works and I really enjoyed it. As a table, we also ordered a couple bottles of wine. Apparently they weren't very good. But, I had a few drinks in me by the time I got to the wine, so it seemed fine to me.   For a party of eight, the total came to close to $900 with tax and tip. The restaurant did comp the two bottles of wine for us since they weren't very good. If the wine was added, it would have been a little over a grand. Not too bad considering all the food and alcohol we ordered for the amount of people at our table.   Come try Del Frisco's next time you're in Vegas. It won't disappoint.   Cheers!",

This one is undoubtedly the best, their meat is the finest, their ambience is second only to Top of the World, and their service is unparalleled.    One time I even mentioned to the waiter than I liked the jellybeans at the front (specifically the yellow and orange ones) and he went and picked out a cup of yellow and orange jelly beans for me.   Last time, the waiter introduced my girlfriend to a fine Moscato that she loved.  It's the little things that make a good memory.    Always a great experience at Del Fresco.

If you are not on a time constraint take time to enjoy a cocktail before dinner. The Manhattan and bourbon berry ginger beer cocktail were spot on. If you like crab cakes, the appetizer with Cajun lobster sauce added the right amount of spice & flavor to a seafood favorite.  We enjoyed the 32 oz tomahawk chop & filet trio -which were well cooked and seasoned. The tomahawk was perfectly seared. There were big chunks of lobster in the lobster mac & cheese -delicious! Oh and if you are a True meat connoisseur the bone marrow butter is not to be missed. If you have room for dessert the lemon cake and espresso martini will complete the experience.",

Sadly that didn't happen and likely will not. We arrived a little early for our reservation only to turn around within a few minutes of looking over the interior and left for a competing steakhouse in a nearby casino. We were so underwhelmed, the interior seemed dingy, somewhat noisy and not anywhere near as welcoming and comfortable as you'd expect a highly rated steakhouse to be. The worst part about this experience is that it began before we opened the door, the valet didn't say a word to us and as we approached the main door a strong sewage smell assaulted the senses. Not what one wants to smell when heading in for a bite to eat.  Because we left, clearly we did not dine so I cannot say much about the food other than we've had the opportunity to dine a couple of times at a Del Frisco's near us in Southern California and food there has been consistently excellent and the service quite good. Hopefully the Double Eagle was just having a bad day but sadly it left a lasting poor impression with us and it's likely we won't return.",

    "text": "This is a typical \"old school\" steakhouse with a modern menu.  The bar was very nice and they pour good strong drinks.  I recommend the Moscow Mule with Jameson.  We were seated in a very loud room.  I realize this is Las Vegas but it was ridiculous. I think if we had told them we wanted to have a more quiet room from the start they would have seated us differently.    Our server was efficient and very friendly. The wine steward spent a good amount of time with us and really helped us pick a great wine. The seafood tower was very good. We ordered 2 because there were 4 of us and everyone had plenty.  We did notice that, while delicious, the crab tasted frozen.  Ok its the desert not Alaska we get it.  Our steaks were delicious and the sides were huge. Enough to share. We had buttercake for desert which was great and of course we shared it. Even the coffee was good.  So you may wonder why not a \"5 star\" rating.  Well, one of the steaks (rib eye) came out and it was shaped like a rib eye except for a very large triangular piece had been cut from the edge of part of the steak.  It made the steak look very unappealing and sort of like it was had a problem area and thats why it had been trimmed.  It also was sort of dry looking.  When questioned the server stated she thought it might have been marbling that had melted during cooking but if we didn't want it she would replace it.  Which they did and I must say they did it rapidly and they brought out a lovely piece of steak on the second try.  My issue is that a restaurant that prides themselves on service and quality should have never placed that odd steak in front of a customer...from the cook to the server they knew it was weird and should have sent it back.  If that had happened they would have gotten their \"5\".  Maybe next time.  Hope you enjoy the James Bond Wine table if you go!!",

The VIP martini infused with pineapple was awesome though, as was their lemon cake . Their scallops weren't as good as I've had in the Bay Area at 5a5, but their crab cake was great . You will have a good meal here but if spending $200+ I expect a great meal, not just a good one.",

    "text": "I'd give this place a solid 4.5 stars.  We started with the lobster bisque.  The price was high, but the flavor totally met my expectations, and there was a lot of lobster meat in there.  The Caesar salad was good, but I've had better.  The filets were absolutely fantastic!  The scallops and crab cake were perfect.  I ordered mashed potatoes with my steak and they were some of the best I've ever had.  The service was great too.  I felt like I really got my money's worth and walked away very happy.  My only real complaint was the bread on the table.  It was like a stale, store bought sesame seed hamburger bun.  Up your bread game Del Frisco's and you will be perfect!",

    "text": "I have been eating at this place for 5 years I come in to get lobster Mac and a drink before going to work at midnight and as soon as I walk in the manager woman tells me in front of everyone my shirt is inappropriate (crop top) so ok I get a jacket then she says to me when I walk back in \"you need to keep it completely covered up or u can't be here\" rude as fuck... I'm at the bar and what do you know a woman who is barely wearing clothes is allowed to wear what she's wearing so now I feel targeted and why who knows.. I use the bathroom the manager woman stalks me to the bathroom and waits for me to go .. a friend buys me a drink I eat than some random guys ask me if I'd join them at their table and they would get me a drink .. I was waiting on my mom to arrive so she could have a drink before we headed home. My mom shows up the guys but us both a drink and I go to the bathroom the manager lady stalks me again to the restroom this time my mother notices . The lady then tells me loudly in front of all guests I need to put my jacket on and I'm banned because I solicit her customers.. (mind u I'm w my mom or hubby or kids almost every time I'm there and I won't refuse a free drink if offered) (yes on occasion I've given someone too drunk a ride still does not mean I'm doing anything wrong nor does she have a right to judge nor assume and that's defamation of character. She tries to tell me I show porn at the bar( being a porn star and someone recognized u and walk up and say hey isn't this u isn't a crime nor is it soliciting nor does it mean I'm doing anything wrong once again) because this woman tried to embarrass me and told me I was trying to pick up this guy to go fuck him her words my mom started saying wait a minute she got free drinks and ur saying she's doing this . I asked the guy who was disgusted at how I was being treated if I was picking him up he said no u have a husband but we're having a drink nothing wrong w that then she goes on to tell the customers her assumptions on me in the past.. but where is there solid proof I'm doing anything other than socializing hanging with fans saying yes I'm a porn star or receiving a free drink. I bring ppl there all the time family n friends when they come to town. Ron is always my bartender and his wife danced with me at the strip club. Just because I'm friendly doesn't mean I'm doing anything. So it escalated and she threatened me with cops and kept pushing me physically to the point I almost hit her and told her don't fucking touch me the valet guy has known me for years everyone there knows I come I eat n I leave it's a restaurant anything other than that is not her business nor concern I'm not conducting anything illegal on the premises she's in charge of I felt targeted and my lawyer is now dealing with it . I'll never eat there and I'm a bring all the pornstars to go protest this place idk what her problem is but she's not a good manager chasing away someone who for years spends 2-500$ a week there.",

We were asked if there were any special requests for seatings on the phone!  Big win right there.  Presentation: The hostess was polite and gracious. We were seated quickly and in a great area. They had the football game on! Score!  Menu: Perfect and we were surprised by their Sunday night couple special. Killer.  Service. Outstanding.Period. No details needed. If you understand fine dining you understand what is expected regarding service, it does not need to be defined.  Food. Steak like butter and tasty, crab cakes, best ever, salad was off the hook. The spinach supreme was so good my bro who doesn't like anything green even thought it was good.  Beer: Dogfish 60 minute IPA...need I say more  Price: Well, when you decide to seek out the best steak houses in town you don't ask cost! But even that being said, on par with the best in their league.  Overall: I'm sure Stripsteak and many others are great in Vegas, but being a SH fan, I could find NO reason why this SH didn't take number one.   Let's see if NYCs location can hold up!   J$",

Try the VIP which is an extremely tasty pineapple infused martini, it will run you about twelve bucks. We went on a Saturday night and there was an awesome piano player setting the tone with some Christmas tunes. They are very good at making sure that if you have a show to get to, that you're out in time. The service is swift. They ask you to cut into your steak when it arrives to make sure that they have cooked it to the appropriate temperature. The wine list is obscene, we saw some bottles listed for $15,000. No, thanks. The bread was freshly baked and extremely tasty. This place is soooo worth the money. Go there now. Be sure to make a reservation though.",

From what we were told that side of the strip has sewer problems when it gets very hot and it was 112 degrees the day we were there. The place smelled like a toilet. Bottom line is to be seated in the dining room to the left or by the bar. They moved us no problem and that was when the magic began. Drinks were promptly served, great bread delivered and specials were recited. I opted for the bone in filet with the crab cake side. It was great.

    "text": "Based on Yelp reviews, I decided to reserve a table here for my friend's bachelor party. Decor wise, it was definitely a more fancy/upscale kind of restaurant. The other clientele also seemed to skew towards an older crowd compared to what you might find at one of the trendy new hotel restaurants on the strip. I felt a little under dressed in my polo and dark jeans. I did see a couple who looked even more dressed down than myself so I don't think they really enforce any kind of dress code. Just to be safe, I probably wouldn't come in sweatpants, shorts, or sandals though.  We had a party of twelve so we were seated in one of the side rooms. I was a little surprised that they had multiple flat screen TVs in the rooms as you don't normally see those at fancy restaurants unless its at the bar. They can be a little distracting if you are trying to have a conversation. Then again, we were a party of 12 dudes and the hostesses probably thought it was appropriate for our \"type\" of party.  The service was excellent as we had multiple servers answering our questions, cutting our steaks, serving our family-style sides, etc. A friend of mine had ordered salmon that came out overcooked. They replaced his meal no questions asked.  I think that all of my friends would agree that the crab cakes and the lobster mac and cheese were the highlights and are the must order items on the menu. Those things were delicious. All of our meat entries were good but nothing really special to write home about considering the cost. Then again I'm not really a steak guy so I'm not really the best person to judge the quality of a piece of meat.  On the drive to the restaurant we did notice the slight sewage smell that some Yelpers have mentioned. However, we did not pick up this scent while inside the restaurant nor while out front by the entrance and parking lot.",

For my main course I ordered the Australian lobster tail. It was a pretty good size but I think it was overcooked. The meat was too rubbery. Thank god for the crab cakes. I would have been unsatisfied. I had a bite of my boyfriends 38oz fred flinstone wagyu beef steak. I wasn't to happy with it. He seemed to like it. I guess I have lost my desire for red meat. They brought out a slice of bday cake for my boyfriends birthday. It was delicious and thick. Oh! If you ever eat here ask to see the cool James Bond table. Pretty coool.",

Our waiter, Chad, was amazing and gave us wonderful recommendations. We had the bacon au poivre. It was pork belly and it was incredible.  It had such a great smoky flavor.   We got 2 steaks so we could do a side by side comparison of the dry aged and the regular.  They were so delicious!  For the dessert,  del Frisco's bright us 2 complimentary desserts for my birthday.  The butter cake was a once in a lifetime dessert. It was so good that I did a little dance in my seat after the first bite! My friends and I are experienced bakers,  and we all loved it so much.  So much so that we went back the next night for round 2.  We walked in and the hostess said,  \"Stephanie, right?\"  The customer service was amazing. The food was \"slap your mama\" good.  The butter cake was one of the BEST desserts I have EVER had.   Spread the word - GET THE BUTTER CAKE!",

    "text": "After reading through some of the recent reviews about the drop in service over the years, I was a bit hesitant about dining there but decided to give it a try anyway.  I ended up making reservations for dinner during my most recent trip and enjoyed every minute of the experience.  Our waitress was wonderful and service was outstanding.  She went over the complete \"specials\" of the night along with answering all the questions that we had. I ordered the bone in ribeye and it was prepared spot on.  The appetizer (oysters), sides (smashed potatoes and asparagus), and steak (bone in ribeye and filet mignon) was all great.  They even brought an unexpected dessert to our table for the birthday girl that had just turned 21! I'm not sure if I could be happier with my choice to dine there, but I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Fiance had one of the dry aged steaks, and he said it was the best he ever had.  I ordered the lobster bisque.  It was too salty, and there was a shell in my soup.  I felt sick after eating some of it, so declined them bringing me a new bowl.  I appreciated the effort to replace it but by that time I felt too ill for any more.  I will say, I had WLS three years ago, so that might have been why the soup effected me as it did, was probably too rich for me.  The server was not as attentive as I would have thought based on the high quality of the food, establishment but what can you do?  All in all the place was okay, I would not choose to return however.",

Once they found out we where local to Vegas things became more light hearted. Not everything was so serious, we where treated like humans instead of snobs. The food is well, as they say you get what you pay for. The food is amazing. Take your time and enjoy everything. The wine cellar is a sight to behold! The smell in there is out of this world. If they put a private table in the cellar..    Ps - There is no privet table in the cellar. However there should be one!  Thank you so much for the memories!",

We reserved a private room which was nice to be away from the hustlin and hustlin going on outside. They were busy and super packed so make sure to make reservations!   We had a set prix fixe menu: APPETIZER: assortment of shrimp cocktails with different sauces, crab legs, and oysters - I didn't get to try everything or else I'd already be full before the main course, the seafood was all fresh, shrimp were gigantic and all very yummy.  SALAD: blue cheese wedge salad with bacon bits- Lord I don't like blue cheese that much but I went for it and cleaned the plate up! Super tasteful and has a powerful punch, definite just try!   ENTREE: 12oz Filet mignon - juicy , tender and cooked at the perfect medium rare.. I never had this before but it was nice to have the servers cut through the steak to make sure that we were all okay with the result. The rub on the filet was mouth wateringly delish.. pretty up there in my list of good steaks.  DESSERT: Chocolate mousse- ugh so decadent and delicious. You have the light mousse and rich chocolatey liquid (I don't know what it was) so amazing!!! Chocolate overload but nice sweet ending to a fabulous dinner.  DRINK: must try one of their famous and well known VIPs, be careful though this one sneaks up on you ;)  *Don't forget to check out their James Bond table* super coool, I'll leave it at that. Great restaurant and superb staff!",

Well babe got reservations and at a great time at that.   I am actually shocked that I've never heard about this place before and I've driven past the area many times over the years. This is my first fancy steak house that I've ever been to, and I'm so happy I got to experience it with my babe.  The parking lot was very small and full so we had to park at the neighboring lot. They have a valet service but seeing that it was a busy night I'm sure their services were very busy as well. When you first walk up to the building the aroma of delicious food just fills the air. Steak is my favorite type of meat and I'm so happy he brought me here!  We checked in and had to wait about 15 minutes from our reservation time before getting seated. They were busy, people in and out. There's a lounge to enjoy cocktails (with live music) while waiting for your table. The restaurant is very big and there are multiple rooms.  We got sat and the hostess was very nice. Hot, toasty, and flaky bread and butter arrived at the table. We got our waters and I had babe order for me. We were both so excited to try everything out!  I got the Wagyu Tomahawk Chop - Medium - for $95. Babe got the 45 Day Dry Aged Prime Strip - Medium Rare - for $69. Lobster Mac and Cheese $18.50  Mashed Potatoes $12  Everything was made very well and I am surprised at how full we got. The portions were huge and I am very impressed by the taste.  I am so thankful to have been able to have such a great date night with my babe! 100% recommend! Make sure you grab reservations for special occasions!",

Staff showed up and had them distributed in the blink of an eye.   Steaks came out.   Slighty overdone.  Not terribly.   But not cooked perfectly for a 70 dollar aged ribeye.    The manager was there to see me cut and judge reaction.  She agreed it was slighty over done.  ( Note, if it was average restaurant, I'd never have expected any better). Approximately 9 damn minutes later, she had a perfect replacement in front of me.  I had already told her I'd eat it as I was in a rush.    Mistakes happen.  Went well above needed to make me happy.    Marciano was our waiter and was perfect in his service.    Overall, outstanding experience that could have easily soured.  We will certainly be back when we can afford to treat ourselves again and will recommend always for fine dining experience.",

They have a special summer menu that includes a salad, 8 oz. Filet mignon or NY strip, a side and dessert for $59. Each item was a full size portion. The food was a solid 4, the service was good and the value for the money was a 5. Therefore,  I give it 4 stars and will be going back soon.",

Her impatiens definitely showed. The drinks were generous and the appetizers came quickly. Unfortunately the appetizers we chose weren't that great. We had the shrimp cocktail with nice size jumbo shrimp but a little bit chewy. We also had the bacon fat pork belly thing whatever it was. Only a third of it was eaten by a table of seven.  For a main course most of the people liked their steaks and I'm glad for that. I however had the lamb blackened and cut for me medium. It had a little extra flavor from being aged but I can't say it was that great for the price.   What really disappointed me was ordering an 18 ounce lobster tail to be sliced and shared by the table.  I don't remember looking at my itemized receipt but I'm sure it cost over $100. Unfortunately it was chewy as rubber.  I mention to our server that it was overcooked and she questioned other people at the table if they thought the same thing. I pointed out you have seven overweight men sitting at a table with pieces of lobster left over. Captain obvious shows that obviously wasn't good if we didn't eat it all. Someone from management or the kitchen came over and asked if we were not happy and I told him I wasn't unhappy it just wasn't very good. Their condolence was to send us a couple of cheap desserts as an apology. I'm sorry but the white table cloths and the big-name don't justify the cost of the bill for the quality of the food we received.received.  This is my first and last time eating the Del Frisco's. For all the times I eat out there are plenty of places to spend half the amount of money and get a better meal.",

Mind you - we make our reservation yesterday. Now you have mad loyal customers- so the extra money tonight won't even out.... even the bonus points on the Vegas glam remodel didn't get this to a 2 star.... to top it off the valet pulled up the WRONG WHITE car!!!

    "text": "Made our reservations on Open Table so it was quick and easy. Arrived about 10 minutes late and was seated after a five minute wait. This place is located in a corporate business center. But it's not hard to find. Waze got us there no problem. It was very busy when we arrived but we were seated in a more quiet area of the restaurant away from the bar. Service was superb. We went here for my daughter's 20th bday celebration and it did not disappoint. Ordered filet mignons, lobster tail, prime rib eye with bone, lobster Mac and cheese, seasoned corn, and shrimp cocktails. My steak was ordered medium and it was a little on the medium rare side but since the plates were hot I just cooked it more by leaving the exposed raw part on the plate for a little bit. Bread is complimentary with butter. When the steaks come out they ask you to cut it down the middle to ensure it was correctly cooked. They also went around and served the sides on your plate. At the end of the meal my daughter was presented with their famous lemon yellow cake slice and a candle (this was also complimentary). Total bill came out to $465 (including an 18% tip). Would recommend!",

    "text": "I was looking forward to my visit at Del Frisco's, it has such good reviews, I couldn't wait to get there. Unfortunately, my experience was less than amazing and not smooth at all.   Before I explain my experience, I'd like to give credit to the servers, they were very nice and attentive and I don't hold them personally responsible for my bad experience.   With that being said, I'll start with the bacon appetizer. This was actually really good and flavorful, I would recommend bacon lovers to give it a try. After the bacon, everything seemed to go down hill.   Sides: mashed potatoes and \"cream of corn\". Mashed potatoes were just OK at best, I've had better instant mashed potatoes to be honest, not impressed. Not fluffy at all and had a dry, blah taste to them. \"Cream of corn\" which was recommended by the waitress as being amazing and a must try, wasn't exactly \"cream of corn\", rather it was just normal corn sauteed with some stuff (forget) with a kick of spice. It wasn't bad but it was not what we were told. Disappointing all around, you come to a steak house for a great steak but also for great sides.  Entrees: We ordered the bone in filet cooked medium well and a porter house cooked medium. The waiter took the time to specifically talk over the temperatures of \"medium well\", slightly warm pink center, cool....and \"medium\" pink throughout but no red, cool. Steaks come out and filet that was supposed to be medium well was medium rare and the porterhouse came out straight rare, very very very red/bloody. Steaks were sent back, 20 minutes later new steaks arrived (as well as new, fresh sides, which was a nice though). This time the porterhouse was prepared as ordered but the filet was well done, extremely overcooked and dry....guess what happened? Yup, sent back for the 2nd time....another 20 minutes later, we got both steaks. Porterhouse was still fine and the filet was back to being too red. I didn't say anything, at this point it was already getting late, we'd been there for forever and just wanted to leave. I ate the ends of the filet as they were more well done. They did bring us each out 1 glass of wine during the waiting periods for the steak but we had been drinking a bottle of wine and they didn't bring us the same wine as we we were drinking, so while it was a nice gesture, it didn't seem to make sense....plus we were done with the drinking, we just wanted the food and wanted to get out of there.   At the very end they offered us complimentary dessert, which again, we didnt really want but ended up ordering one thing to split. I forget what it was but it was good.  Overall, my experience was tiring, frustrating and expensive. Instead of comping us 2 glasses of wine that we didn't want, they should have taken my steak off the bill. Three times and they couldn't get it right. They blamed the cooking issue on the bone, saying cooking a bone in filet is very tough.....but I've had bone in filets prepared perfectly plenty of times so to me that wasn't a good excuse.   If you don't care which way your steak comes out, whether it be bleeding on your plate or so well done it tastes like leather, come here. Otherwise, theres many other options in Vegas where you can get a steak cooked the way you ordered it.",

Being that it is a steak house, it is pricey but totally worth it. We shared the wagyu tomahawk steak and it just melts in your mouth, cooked and seasoned perfectly! We paired that with the lobster mac and cheese and it goes so well together. Before that we started off with crab cakes. My husband doesn't usually like crab cakes but will only get it here. Lastly, the VIP cocktail is deadly but so yummy!!! You'll keep asking for a refill on it but won't realize that you're drunk already.   To top all this great food off is the AMAZING service we get there. Friendly service from the person that sat us down, the waitress/waiter and people bringing the food out. None of that fake customer service, they're all genuine and all have a great sense of humor.   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner this past Saturday when my cousins and I were all in town.  We were celebrating 3 belated birthdays and Del Frisco's definitely did not disappoint.  I really really really wanted to give 5 stars because of the service and friendliness of everyone there, especially our server and the one southern guy with a beard!  I didn't catch their names but service was impeccable!   We also had a 15 month old at our table and they were great with him as well.  \"Southern guy with a beard\", which is what we all referred to him as once we left, even offered to show us the 007 wine display (which my nephew loved) and explained the story behind it!  Super cool!  Anyways, we kind of went all out for dinner.  We started with 2 of the shrimp appetizers which came with several large shrimp prepared 3 different ways.  All 3 were good except the shrimp was overcooked and a bit chewy.  We also had 2 orders of the foie gras.  It was my first time trying foie gras and I actually did not enjoy it at all.  Of course, the complimentary bread and butter was delicious and we devoured 3 loafs!  As for dinner, they had a prix fixe menu option that night and we all ended up going with that.  It was $59 and included a salad, a steak, and a side dish.  The salad choices included a classic, a wedge salad, and a ceasar salad.  All very good, especially the classic which came with 2 large strips of bacon.   For the main course, there were several choices which I don't remember specifically but we all ended up going with the 16oz Prime Rib Eye for a $15 upcharge.  The steaks came with a crab cake and a choice of a side dish ranging from mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and onions, and creamed spinach with bacon.  We all got different sides so we were able to have some of everything.  We also added 2 orders of lobster mac n cheese.   The steak came out perfectly cooked and was delicious!  Seasoned very well and perfectly medium.  I really liked that our server explained how their chef cooks medium rare, which sounded a bit too 'rare' for my liking, which is why I ordered mine Medium.    As for the side dishes, my main gripe was that everything was extremely salty.  The creamy, buttery, and oily was all expected, and of course it was delicious, but everyone at the table agreed that the side dishes were just a bit too salty.    Now with all that said, I still think this was one of the best birthday dinners I've had in my 30 years of life which is definitely saying something.  They brought out a couple of desserts (not sure if it was complimentary or not) for the 3 birthdays we told them about and they were all good as well but by that point, we were all so full that we didn't really get to appreciate them.  **Edit** How did I forget about the VIP Pineapple vodka cocktail.  Holy moly, I don't normally drink vodka but this cocktail, which is literally just vodka infused with pineapple, was amazing!  It tasted like Pina!!!  Definitely try this on your next visit!",

We planned to order the dry-aged 16oz Ribeye (me) and 8oz Filet (wife), but the waiter told us about the 32oz dry-aged double eagle Ribeye, so we decided to split it. It was a huge disappointment. It was tough, dry and flavorless. It was somewhat comical watching the waiter trying to cut it table side. It was a mess. Management tried to make things right, so that was good, but I really just wanted a delicious steak.  This place has lots of good reviews, so we might have been really happy if we just stuck with our original plans. I would stay away from that 32oz double eagle Ribeye ($125).",

Other tables in our party received a drink order, prior to wine...not ours. Our lead host informed us that we would also have hors d'oeuvres including crab cakes with our meal...our table didn't get any crab cakes...  The bacon wrapped scallop & lamp chop hors d'oeuvres were decent with the lamb chop standing out for being light, delicate and flavorful.  The meal started off with 3 shrimp cocktail which were overcooked and not too fresh...they were pretty big \"shrimp\" though.  Ordered the blue cheese iceberg lettuce salad and the Del's salad came out instead?!? The Del's salad wasn't too fresh and there was a tad too much dressing on the salad.  The 16 oz ribeye was cooked to perfection at medium rare. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. The ribeye was a Prime cut and was super fatty...since the 16 oz cut was too big anyways.  The waitstaff seemed to have messed up the steak orders for other folks at my table...some received a filet instead of a ribeye while others received their steak medium instead of medium rare...  Meal ended off with a chocolate mousse which was too rich and sweet.  Service was very prompt and efficient by the staff...but they kept on serving while we had a speaker speaking?!? ...the staff also disappeared after they served dessert?!?",

I called that morning and was able to get a reservation that day for 6:00. We were warmly greeted at the front and was taken to our seats rather quickly. Upon seating, we found an anniversary card signed by the whole staff which was a nice touch! Our server was Gary and he was very accommodating. We ordered a bottle of red wine, and cocktails to start with their Shanghai-Style Fried Calamari which was delicious! For our entree, my husband and I both ordered their famous Wagyu Tomahawk Chop (and no we didn't share! I was hongry!), the Broiled Lobster Tail, the Iceberg Wedge Salad, the Sauteed Mushrooms with Pearl Onions, the Lobster Mac and Cheese, the Potatoes Au Gratin, and the Asparagus with Roasted Almonds. Did I mention I was hungry?? Everything came out quickly and all the items were delicious. They even provided us with an Anniversary dessert . I must say, they made our Anniversary very memorable! After coming home a week later, we received a handwritten card from Gary thanking us for visiting them. I did take off one star because I was a little disappointed that my Tom Ford sunglasses were left on the table and was never found.",

    "text": "Interesting steakhouse. Very high hopes given the reviews. I give it two stars because of the service which was 4 to 5 stars. However, the food left a lot to be desired. There is a clear issue with cooking the steaks. One of our parties orders steak was over cooked and had to be sent back, then was not returned until everyone had completed their meals. The second member of our party ordered a medium and it came out rare. The waiters said to cut it and use the hot plate. No luck. Sent it back. They cooked it more or did something. Came back rare again. Just gave up at that point. The manager did give a 25% discount on each ruined steak item which was pathetic.",

    "text": "A buddy made reservations for our group and we sat at the private room behind the James Bond table. Spoiler alert! You can see the uploaded pics, and I won't ruin it with a description, but it's not quite the same as seeing this contraption up close and personal.  Our private dining room was next to the wine storage, and it was quite a well stocked inventory of vintages, magnums, and I think that was a Nebuchadnezzar because it was a gigantic bottle of wine. Biggest container of fermented grape juice I ever did see!  Food was excellent. Yes, it's spendy, and the overall quality in taste, preparation, and presentation is fantastic. From what I ordered and sampled among sharable plates, you can't go wrong with any menu selection. They will go the extra mile to make sure your entree is made to your satisfaction.  Service was fantastic throughout the evening. The waitstaff checked on us early and often. Drinks were refilled regularly. It's a good thing we were sequestered from the open dining areas because after a few rounds of cocktails and wine bottles, we got loud and obnoxious. Despite our shenanigans, service remained professional and tolerant. Our waitress was well versed in the menu and made suggestions to compliment and enhance entree selections. Whether you're in Las Vegas or other entertainment destination, it's an added bonus to have a knowledgable waitstaff, bartender, or other industry professional who might have inside info or the hookup to a nearby hotspot. Take care of them and they might return the courtesy.  Definitely a superb experience at Del Frisco's.",

But I need to get into a little more right now.  Mac N Cheese? Yes. So rich and creamy and it reheats well, and you just continue to eat it... and eat it... and eat it. YOU CANNOT STOP!!! I am eating some right now... but please come stop me,  Au Gratin potatoes? Cheese on cheese on cheese on tickles with cheese. And the potatoes are soft and so buttery. Go now... why are you still reading this!  The Meat... I can review this so freaking fast. Cooked perfectly melts in your mouth a nice medium rare is all you need. Anything above medium... get the hell out!! You don't deserve meat.  I have had every single dessert they have and my suggestion would be to get the lemon cake... I was lying about eating mac n cheese earlier but I am in fact eating my left over lemon cake right now, gleefully laughing at those of you who are not!  THE VERDICT: You feel like royalty here and like any steakhouse they treat you like royalty which technically I am... about 600 years back so, I kind of deserve it. This is one of my 3 go to steakhouses when i go to vegas. And it should be yours, it is totally once a year kind of thing, pretty expensive... well I will see you later!",

We were very glad we did!  The service and staff were impeccable, friendly, knowledgeable, competant and most important: friendly..(did I mention that once already?).   Now the food..AMAZING. The steaks are incredible, perfectly cooked and flavorful. My medium Filet Mignon was perfect pink, swimming in natural juices, and tender enough to cut with a fork..it was carnivore heaven. If that isnt enough their hot bread and butter is to die for!! Also, their desserts are incredibly scrumcious. I had their signature lemon cake and it is the best I have  ever had. I am quite the lemon connoisseur and even I was blown away.  This place truly cares about giving a great experience and backs it up with its amazing food. My highest carnivore recommendation!",

Martini's were delicious, they have a house pineapple infused vodka they use for their house martini, it was great.  The chopped salad (may have been chef salad) was drenched in dressing and that made it soggy, could have done without it.  Rib eye was yummy.  Cooked perfectly and the waiter was thorough in making sure we sliced our steak before he left our table.  Chateau potatoes were also great, not the best, but definitely yummy with a right texture.

The petite filet was cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. Side dishes, mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, we're fine.  And, as stuffed as I was, once the banana bread pudding came out I couldn't resist.  And, it was exceptional.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Great service too.

Our waiter was also a Californian so A+!!!  Haha jk, but really though, that was pretty cool that he was originally from Santa Barbara!  He recommended that we order two crab cakes because we would end up not wanting to share it and he was correct.  The crab cake was the perfect amount for an appetizer without getting too full for our steaks and sat in a heavenly pool of cajun lobster sauce *drool.  I ordered the filet and I forget what my boyfriend ordered, but he couldn't finish it lol.  We also got an order of the lobster mac and cheese which was probably one of the best mac and cheese dishes I've ever had.  If you've read my other reviews, I've stated that I generally do not like mac and cheese, but this one....god...just order it.  You have nothing to lose!!  Overall the ambiance here is wonderfully romantic, the service is top notch, and they brought me a fat slice of cake for my birthday!  I can't wait to come here again and am so happy that my boyfriend's friends recommended him to take me here for my birthday.  Wahoooo!",

Did have an issue with the hostess when i called to see about their wait, she said there was none and when i got there it happen to be 30 mins (took like 20 mins to get seated) and it took me 3-5 mins to get there. If there was a wait, she should of just told us and i would of been okay with it.   Stepped into the bar area and they had some live music playing, a guy on the piano. The bartender was nice and they had a decent selection of beers. We finally got seated and it did take a minute for the waiter to attend to us but it is ok. I ordered a wedge salad to start with a rib eye steak as my main course. I ordered the asparagus and my coworker also ordered the rib eye with potatoes au gratin (caesar salad as a starter). Sides are family style. Started with the bread which was wonderful, the salads where good but nothing spectacular. The steak was the main event! It was seasoned perfect and cooked exactly how i wanted it. The sides where a good companion to the steaks. The steak here was one of the best steaks i have ever eaten in my life time. I will go back with no hesitation (actually i will hesitate a bit, $160 for two people with no tip)!",

Steaks are always juicy and flavorful. The sides are simply amazing. Crab cakes before is never a disappointment. Toryn the GM is always a pleasure to deal with. Looking forward to taking my sales team at the end of the month!",

    "text": "I was a little disappointed, considering the high reviews and the namesake of the restaurant.  Here's why:  The PROS: 1) THE STEAK:  we got the signature Double Eagle cut medium rare.  It's True what people say - that the steak are a little undercooked than you're used to - HOWEVER, the steak is so gorgeously cooked, it didn't bother me at all.  The steak had a lovely crust on it with great seasoning, and the inside was a little undercooked but the steak's flavor and tenderness was so good that it didn't matter. 2) THE CHOUX CORN:  Really interesting twist to creamed corn.  It's cooked with bacon bits and poblano pepper bits.  It's just a tad creamy - not too decadent, which is a nice change because the steak was very decadent.   3) THE ATMOSPHERE:  The place is really nice - lots of mahogany wood and glass.  It also smelled of cigar which gave it that Vegas/baller air to it.  The CONS: 1) Our seating area:  The hostess sat us next to a table with 2 kids in their party.    We were obviously a couple trying to have a nice dinner, but the 2 kids were so noisy and whiney - it killed the mood until they left after we finished our appetizer.  I wish they were cognizant of what kind of dining atmosphere a couple would want. 2)  The sides:  lobster mac and cheese - unfortunately the lobster was so fishy, I just took a few bites and was over it. No offense, but Mastro's lobster mac and cheese still takes the crown.  The dish was also not cheesy - it was creamy but I'd like to see strands of melted cheese getting pulled as I spoon it onto my plate and into my mouth.  The spinach supreme - I usually love bacon.  I seriously do.  This dish had half bacon, half spinach/sauteed onion.  I was expecting bacon bits accenting the dish - I wish they asked me, \"would you like some spinach with your bacon supreme?\"  =( 3)  Service:  She was good but she didn't ask us if we were here for a special occasion or if it was our first time here.  It was our anniversary and it was indeed our first time, but I'm not going to mention it if she's not going to ask us.  I feel like if I do that, then I'm asking for a dessert handout - which I'm always welcome to, but I'm not a beggar. 4)  Dessert:  She recommended the lemon cake and the chocolate mousse.  We went with the mousse.  It was good but we were so surprised at how dense the chocolate mousse was.  It was way too rich, so we started eating only the fluffy marshmallow top instead.  They have sorbets but no ice cream variety - only vanilla - that was really disappointing because we expected at least a variety of basic ice cream from a fancy place.  Overall, the steak carried the stars to this rating.  The steak is truly amazing, amazing enough to visit an off-strip restaurant, but unfortunately everything else fell short.    I don't think we'll return but we were glad that we tried it.",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined here the day after Turkey Day.  Del Frisco's is a short cab ride off the strip.  You will notice an older crowd dines there which is a nice change from the hoochie mommas walking the strip.  We were seated in one of their dining rooms and lucky enough for my man they had a flat screen showing the game.  I had to have a cocktail while looking over the menu so I ordered their signature drink \"The VIP.\"  It is a pineapple martini where they soak the fruit for days in vodka to get all of its juices.  It was faboosh!    After taking some time with the menu, my fiance and I decided to split the wedge salad and a bone in filet.  As for the sides we had the lobster mac n' cheese along with the grilled asparagus.  They brought out our steak and it was a little too bloody for me so they kindly took it back to be cooked more.  Once that was done they served up our beef and side and now it was time to chow down.  The whole meal was great.  No complaints from me.  The staff was more than helpful, the cocktail get me a lil tipsy, and the meat put me in food coma.  I just wish after devouring our meal I had room for dessert.  There is always a next time.",

    "text": "Aaaaaaaa... so disappointed in giving this place 3 stars... mainly because it's partly my fault and mostly theirs...  First I have to give 5 stars plus for the staff, waitress, for making the dining experience top notch... when my son's girlfriends steak was under done they immediately took it back to make it right... they then brought us another side dish to compensate us for the wait... the waitress found out my daughter was graduating and brought out the lemon cake (which was the best dessert) along with our other two desserts we had ordered, fully comped... the service was as good as Mastro's steak house where we live in Costa Mesa... So why the 3 stars? The Wagyu 32 oz. bone in ribeye was 2 stars... for $90 you'd expect non-chewy texture, like the Mastro's 32 oz. bone in ribeye for half the price... I was expecting melt in your mouth over the top steak just like the service and staff were... unfortunately, each bite had sinew strands throughout... I've had better pieces of meat at Costco...  and this is where it's my fault... I needed to say something to them... if I did they would have tried to fix it or probably would have comped me for the dinner... but I felt guilty for complaining to them because that's just not me... I don't complain... I'm Japanese, I smile a lot, say it's good, but never return if it's bad... especially if I spent $100 per person for steak...  My son split the Double Eagle ribeye and unfortunately it was also tough... my daughter ordered the filet and it was great...  I should have listened to the waitress, I think she was trying to steer me to the filet... she did mention she enjoyed the filet because of the texture and she did not like the \"chew\" of the ribeye... hmmmmmmmm... that was the tip... never heard someone say \"chew\" for an expensive cut of meat before... but \"chew\" is the perfect description of what I had... and unfortunately, \"chew\" is not what you would want to pay for. I probably would have given this place 2 stars because that's how bad the rib eye was but I have to give this place 3 stars because that's how good the staff was... I'm sad I won't be back... but glad Mastro's Steakhouse is in my neck of the woods... never tried Mastro's here, but did try the Mastro's Seafood house in Newport Beach... and experienced the samething as Del Frisco's... great service... bad steak... so I don't want to try the one in Vegas... What I noticed about steak in Vegas is... over priced and not as good a quality... I don't think I will eat steak in Vegas anymore... period.",

    "text": "Having been to Vegas more than several times, eventually you get tired of the food on the strip even if it is the best dinner buffet of all the hotels on the strip. So I asked my friend who goes there for business for one of his recommendations on where a member of the Rat Pack may have dined (although Vegas has changed so much since those days, and even since the last time I've been there!).  Forget Gordon Ramsay's \"Steak\" - go to a real steakhouse in Del Frisco's! Even if they are not unique to Vegas (check their website for all their locations), the experience felt like Vegas.  I don't really know where to start because everything from the moment we walked in to going out the door was fantastic.  Service - it was all hands on deck as we had a server and host for every aspect of the meal and they were each genuinely attentive. We were \"personally\" served by at least 5 different people for our party of 4.   Drinks - not a large drink menu, but each drink was made to perfection. For me it was the perfect opportunity to order Don Draper's drink of choice - \"An Old Fashioned\" - and I could see myself definitely trying to keep up with Don just because of this drink. I don't need to go into their wine collection except needless to say it is amazing - including an appraised $1.5M James Bond limited edition wine set which you must specially request to see.  Delicious sides - I haven't even gotten to the steaks yet because I'll save the best for last. But the sides are a close 2nd. You don't need 2-3 sides per person, but it'll be hard to decide what to share amongst your party. For our party of 4, we got 5 sides and each one no matter how simple it was - it was better than any version of it I've had before. Like spinach! or mushrooms! The MUST have is the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese. Again, one would think based on how good it is we should each get our own order of this super delicious side. But amongst us 4 guys, we barely finished it because it was so rich. And of course we were pretty filled from all the other food/bread.  Finally the steak - good. Very good. My buddy and I had to share their \"Tomahawk\" Rib Steak which is the biggest steak on their menu - a 32 oz Wangyu American Kobe Rib-eye steak. As mouth-watering as that sounds to the steak-lover who wants to devour all 32 oz of it, there is simply too much goodness to save room for. So if have a willing partner to share the Tomahawk, I highly suggest doing so so you can dip your fingers in everything else Del Frisco has to offer.  We did not make it to dessert but I'm gonna stake my next steak dinner on that it's gonna be worth bursting a button for.",

I've definitely had better (Ruth's Chris; Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab).  My steak was cook right, but there was a major lack of flavor.  It tasted like a plain piece of meat.  We ordered the potatoes au gratin and those were blan tasting too.  I'm not too sure what everyone else is raving about?!  Perhaps my husband and I ate there on a off-night? Not too sure. All I know is we definitely won't be coming here again.",

The caesar was good and the croutons were obviously made right there because they melted in your mouth. I had the 22 porterhouse steak, medium rare, which came out exactly as ordered. Delicious clear to the bone. My wife had two 4 oz filet mignon medallions. One was served \"oscar\" style with bernaise, crab and asparagus. The other was served with a jumbo shrimp and a large scallop.  For sides we chose the asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin. The whole meal was a great dining experience. For dessert we had coffee and the lemon cake. We will definitely be going back on our next trip to Vegas.",

They want you to cut the meat to make sure it is to your liking before walking away. I promptly cut off a piece of meat, stuffed it in my mouth, and salivated as I tasted an explosion of flavors. The fish and seafood soup was delicious too.     The service was fantastic and I was so impressed on how on top of things they were. The servers, hosts, and managers all worked together and catered to the customer's every need. Our server was friendly and attentive and when he wasn't around there was always someone to assist us. At one point I was reaching for the spoon for the yummy sauted mushrooms and one of the managers rushed over to scoop the mushrooms on my plate.  Unexpected, but definitely appreciated. Different hostess and managers would walk around and make sure you had water etc.   I am making it a point to stop by every time I'm in town",

The sides were pretty good and were served to us by the staff.  The best part about it was that when your steak came out they asked you to cut a slice and taste it to make sure that this is what you want.  Presumably, if they over or under cooked the steak they would take it back and get it right.  Mine was perfect but I appreciate that they wanted to make sure the steak was properly cooked.

I dealt with a knowledgeable booker who arranged a private room, Dakota,  for our party of 9 the afternoon of my dinner.    I arrived 30 minutes prior to the scheduled time and was escorted to the room promptly.  I was introduced to my two servers, Jonathan and another guy, who were both professional and proficient.  I explained how I wanted the meal to proceed and they were appropriately accommodating.    Most everyone in our party ordered some sort of steak and they were uniformly excellent.  Mine was the bone-in filet and it was great.  I started with the shrimp roumalade (sp) that I had ordered on a previous occasion there and it was great.  Large, meaty shrimp in a tangy sauce.    One of the sides ordered was some potato chip thing that got raves from everyone there.  The wine list was extensive enough to enable anyone to find something appropriate.    We were fortunate enough to wind up getting a tour of the kitchen as well as a first hand look at the James Bond Table.  It was a great way to break up the meal and my associates are still talking about it.  The whole meal was great start to finish and I would certainly recommend Del Friscos to anyone looking  for a reliable steak place in Vegas.",

We had brought a special (and expensive) bottle of wine to celebrate the occasion.  The restaurant stance was that they will not open any outside wine that is on their wine list, mind you the wine list had the incorrect year, so technically it wasn't on their wine list.  After much hemming and hawing and getting management involved they finally agreed to open the wine for an outrageous $50 corkage.  Also keep in mind we had told them we were going to order at least 3 additional bottles of wine from their wine list.   I was shocked by the behavior and attitude that we received over this bottle!!  Onto the food.... I started with the crab cake and seafood soup, both excellent and worthy of 5 stars. For my main course I ordered the petite filet, I was so disappointed.  It was way too thin and overcooked.  My husband got the larger filet which was nice and thick and cooked beautifully.  I was surprised by the quality disparity between the two filets. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake, very rich and delicious.",

Regarding the food - their crab cake was pretty good, but I feel like the filet is so hyped up. I honestly didn't think it was as good as other places in Vegas. I thought the filet was a little too burnt on the outside, and yes, it did somewhat melt in my mouth, but there wasn't enough flavor. I also got the sauteed mushrooms, which I thought were bland and regular. Their scallops were too salty and their mashed potatoes weren't great either :( I would rate their food a 2.   But their service is what really got to me and why I'm giving it only one star. First, we ordered the crab cake, and then we decided to switch to the prix fixe menu. And it said crab cake was part of the prix fixe menu. So from our two prix fixe orders, we told the waitress that since we already ordered the crab cake as one appetizer, we'll just get the scallops as the second appetizer. We kept clarifying, because we knew she was confused, that we were only going to get ONE appetizer because we already ordered crab cakes as the other appetizer from the two prix fixe menu.   In the end, of course, she brings out two appetizers of scallops and we get charged for an extra order of crab cake. We didn't even bother trying to argue it out with her. It was just a mess, she gave us the wrong check and then it took forever for her to swipe our card.   I would honestly never go back. I think I'll be trying Mastro's next.",

I give this 10 stars for 10 reasons: 1.) Staff/ Servers are very friendly and accommodating. They would have conversations with you because they have time to& because they want you to feel comfortable; not one attends to you, several servers do- They work as a team.  2.) Water level --on point. Never had to ask for refill!  3.) Atmosphere . Some say it's loud, but I enjoy the live performer on the piano singing. Definitely a personal touch rather than the same old music playing through speakers  4.) Yes please, scoop those sesame seeds (from complimentary bread loaf) off my table ;) Cleanliness is always a plus and never goes unnoticed :) 5.) Crab cakes --TO DIE FOR. Best crab cake I've ever tasted! (Even though I only got one)Crab in every bite! And that sauce!! Mmm! 6.) Serving your dishes: Had 3 servers come out at once to put sides on your plate . Wow, talk about a proper serving! 7.)  House salad n chopped salad . Simple yet delicious! Thee best! Thick slices of bacon *thumbs up* 8.) Lobster Mac so creamy n cheesy. & the Sauteed mushrooms --just the right buttery n peppery flavor   9.) THE STEAKS . O m g .. Thick n cooked right the first time. Medium well. Dry Rub was perfect 10.) Our complimentary lemon cake . Such a huge slice! Tasty n not too sweet    10 STARS!!!! Will be back forsure !",

    "text": "For my friend's birthday, she wanted steak, so after looking around at several different places in Vegas, we decided to try Del Frisco's because they have a summer special of dinner for two for $99.00 and boy oh boy, it was an excellent meal!  The \"Power Couple\" is a specially priced three-course dinner for two.  Valid until 9/5/2011.  From the Del Frisco website, it comes with:  -  STARTER (Choice of one per guest) DEL'S SALAD or CAESAR SALAD  - SIDE (Choice of one per guest) CHATEAU POTATOES or SPINACH SUPREME or BAKED POTATO or SAUTEED MUSHROOMS or VEGETABLE OF THE DAY  - ENTREES (For each guest) 8 OZ. FILET MIGNON and SIGNATURE CRAB CAKE  - DESSERT (Choice of one per guest) CHEESECAKE or BREAD PUDDING or CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  The food and service was superb.  Absolutely excellent!!!  I had the Del's Salad, Baked Potato (and some of her sauteed mushrooms), filet (medium rare), crab cake, and bread pudding.  The restaurant makes double, triple and quadruple sure that your steak is cooked perfectly to your liking!!!  The night we went, there was a live performer, a guy playing piano and singing.  Most of the selections were Earth, Wind, and Fire, Barry White, etc.  Overall, an excellent dining experience!  Just too much food for me.  We couldn't finish the baked potato, sauteed mushrooms, or the desserts.  It's too bad we weren't able to eat them later.  The restaurant decor is very classy.  There's hardly any light in the restaurant, so it was hard to take pictures without a flash (Please see my pictures).  If you're looking for an excellent steak, try Del Frisco's!!!  Xie Xie!!!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a bunch of guys  and it definitely is a very man's place.  When I walked in, it was all men which was weird.  We were seated quickly but as one of my friend's pointed out, why are there TVs, it makes the place tacky.  I'm not a big fan of TVs in restaurants unless it's in the bar or if it's a sports bar type of restaurant.  TV in the dining room in the steakhouse?  No thank you.  I think with the NBA playoffs on, it took half of my attention away during dinner.  So how was the food?  Eh, it really wasn't all that good.  Steak was oily, didn't have a lot of flavor and the foie gras buttered we ordered didn't even have that much foie gras taste to it.  They didn't specify the steaks were dry aged or anything and I felt the selection was limited.  The waiter kept on pushing us to order the lobster tail which was pretty pricey but we didn't.  We ordered crab cakes and calamari to share and it was average.  They do have a James Bond table which opens up with many James Bond bottle of wines (labels had James Bond pictures and etc) and plays the 007 theme.  That was pretty cool and probably the highlight of the place.    If you like old school steak house I think this would be good for you but if you don't then skip it.",

He's somehow slowly turned me onto beef, and this was the perfect place to try the highly lauded steak. First of all, the sesame seed bread that is served before the meal is incredible. We went through almost 3 rolls before our food even got there! We also tried their signature martini that had a great pineapple flavor.   I had one of their specials of the day, which included two jumbo shrimp and an 8 oz filet mignon. The meat was perfectly tender and juicy. I'm not a huge meat lover, so the portion was just enough to not be over the top. We also shared a lobster mac and cheese that was a little too creamy and cheesy for me, but it was overflowing with tender pieces of lobster. Since we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us a piece of their lemon cake on the house. It was a huge slice, and the texture of the cake was dense in the perfect way. The frosting wasn't overwhelming, with just a thin layer between each of the six layers of cake.   As a poor college student, this kind of dining experience only comes around once in awhile. The service was extremely attentive and the food was probably too high-quality for me to recognize! I now have exceedingly high standards for steak, so if I can ever come back I definitely will.",

It seems every casino has one, and the usual suspects are also here, as well as Brazilian and Italian steakhouses and meat markets of every variety.   We visited Del Frisco's on Valentine's Day and were not blown away, although the food was really pretty good. The shrimp cocktail came with huge prawns, the oysters on the half-shell were fresh, the steaks were excellent, and a lamb dish was delicious after we sent it back for a bit more searing - it originally arrived nearly raw. The side dishes were good, too - creamed spinach with bacon, and lobster mac and cheese.  The service was oft-putting. Way too aggressive. Almost like we were being coached...to spend more money. Back off on the up-sell, people. Your customers are going to overspend for dinner, regardless.   Four stars for the food. Minus-one for the service vibe.",

    "text": "If you have been to the Del Frisco's in Houston then you are probably expecting a wonderful experience in Las Vegas. Sadly, when you enter Del Frisco's of Las Vegas you quickly find that not only is it in a terrible location with no view - but it's interior and overall atmosphere is poor right from the second you enter the door. Aside from that, let's just get down to the food which is what we want. Del Frisco's prides themselves on service and presentation - you get neither in Las Vegas. I loved Del Frisco's in Houston - I went several times per month.   Upon making a reservation in Las Vegas - they asked was there anything special - I advised them a birthday. Once we arrived, we were placed in a table in the center of a room. Not that I'm too particular, but the arrangement of their furniture in this cramped dark building does not make for a nice dining experience. Anytime they place you in a table in the center of the room you get the great fortune of being gawked at as others lose interest in their table. As well, the service was not up to par. One server waited on us - rushed through the menu.   Once the food arrived, it was not up to standard. Steak was not cooked well and the cut of meat was poor. As well, the drinks did not taste fresh. Lastly, the birthday we mentioned during the reservation was forgotten. I will NEVER go back to this one. Horrific! Poor location, no view, horrific lighting, poor layout of tables and poorly trained staff. If you want a solid steak - Fix at the Bellagio is the best in town.",

We also had the lobster mac n cheese and sauteed mushrooms, both totwally worth it.   One warning if you're getting a larger cut of meat (16oz +) you may want to stick to the leaner sides as the lobster m&c was delicious but very rich.   We saw a couple of tables around us order lobster tails that where HUGE so if you're a lobster nut then it may be worth it. All of us where there for the steak so we where good to go.

I am sure this rivals the top steakhouses on the strip (it's probably even better). The service is top notch, they seem to work in a team and to make sure that you are taken care of. There was a slight delay with getting one of our mixed drinks and they made sure to let us know that we weren't forgotten.  We added on stone crab as well (the same as what Joe's has). Very nice.  Everyone dresses up so go at least business casual. They do have a sign in front, something like \"dress code required\". I didn't read any anything specific (jackets etc). There patio set-up looked nice. Next time, assuming it's not blazing hot, I would like to sit out there.  They also have this awesome James Bond table (you gotta ask about it!). I would definitely be back!!! Well worth it!!!!",

We were even told our cab was outside waiting for us towards the end of dinner and in fact it was not. This place really needs to get it together and I do not understand the excellent reviews this restaurant gets. the only thing we enjoyed here was the lemon cake.   To be honest this restaurant is at the same level as Outback Steakhouse. The only plus is that the noise level wasn't too loud so you can actually conduct a little business during dinner. With so many options in Las Vegas I will never return to the steak house no matter which occasion it may be.",

I did make a special request,  I asked if there was any way I could get them a round of drinks and a dessert on me.  The person who took the call said they could accommodate this request, asked me for my e-mail address and assured me everything would be taken care of.  I never heard back from them - my buddy never got his round and his dessert.  I realize that they probably don't get requests like this often, but if it wasn't possible/feasible please let me know.

When I found out that there was a Del Frisco's a little closer to home (closer as in Las Vegas is only 270 miles away from SoCal), I was ecstatic.  The food and service is unparalleled.  It's an upscale, expensive steakhouse, but soooooo worth it.... over and over again.  I'd go there just for the bread!  I request some bread to take home at the end of the meal.  I treated my family to an extravagant dinner here (mostly because I wanted to go).    We went in for an early dinner because we had slightly unpredictable 3- and 5-year old boys with us, so we didn't want to go when it was busy.  The waitstaff was extremely hospitable and went out of their way to cater to all of us.  I was blown away that they didn't mind the kids making a bit of a mess and running around getting in their way.  In fact, the staff was more amazed that my nephews figured out some of the silverware was magnetized!  A fun distraction for the kids.  I think the staff quickly printed out some pictures for the kids to color when they saw us sit down.  Back to the food.... amazing, heavenly, mouth-watering.  The steak is the best I've ever had, and I'm a steak kind of gal.  Sides are usually ordered separately, but the prix fixe menu was very convenient.  Del Frisco's is hands down, my favorite restaurant.",

Truly 5 star.  *We came 30min late, and the hostess escorted us to our party  *She asked if I had a preference of the kind of Vodka for my screwdriver, then gave me recommendations.  *Waitress addresses today's specials and recommendations.  *Multiple servers catering for us *She asked me to cut my prime rib to ensure that it was cooked medium, if not she'll take it back *Hot towels. Not the ones in a plastic.  *Farewells from lots of staff as we left.  *They hand feed you...lol. jk.  - Great presentation. The seafood platter looked like a piece of art.  - Delicious meat. I usually stuff my mouth with all kinds of food at once, but the prime rib was so good that I chewed each piece independently. No concurrent side in mouth. No fast chewing. Really enjoying the rich flavor and texture until I swallowed it. haha. sounds gross.  - Nice piano cocktail music that sets the tone.  - I do have a bias for Maestro's Ocean Club in NPB simply bc that was where we had our first date. Nonetheless, this is an incredible place for any special occasion. James Bond table!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ate here at his company Christmas Party. The company had reserved a good sized private room that comfortably fit a party of about 50-60 people. The interior of the room was elegantly rustic and dimly lit. (but not dark)  There were about 3-4 different waiters/waitresses that were serving appetizers that I had to physically stop myself from eating an outrageous amount of because they were just THAT good.   Coconut Shrimp- Succulent, sweet, just the right amount of coconut and not at all greasy. They were served with a sweet/tangy sauce that had already been drizzled atop each shrimp. The sauce was not overwhelming and it perfectly balanced the savory notes of each bite.   Bruschetta- I only had one of these because I found them a little difficult to eat. The tomatoes kept falling off and because I had my wine glass in the other hand, it made it that much more difficult to catch the falling food. Other than the difficulty (yes, i could have put my wine glass down.... but who the heck does that?) they were a flavor explosion in my mouth. The garlic added a bit of a kick and the balsamic vinegar had the perfect amount of sweetness that balanced out the whole thing.   Vegetable quesadillas- these were good, but nothing that I can't make at home. I remember them having onions and peppers. But that's it.  Mini Crab Cakes- I probably could have eaten like 17 of these but because I was at a company Christmas Party, I had to painfully hold myself back. I have had terrible crab cakes that had more breading than crab and I can honestly tell you that these are the EXACT opposite. The crab was so sweet and thankfully didn't have any hint of ocean water to them. They were seasoned perfectly and seared just right.   The main course that I chose was the tuna steak. It was served with brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The tuna was covered in different seasonings (couldn't really tell what types) that included black sesame seeds. The center was still red, the fish was VERY fresh and had a very clean and crisp taste to it. The mashed potatoes were velvety and garlic-y and the brussels sprouts were sauteed with butter and had little chunks of bacon throughout. I had a bite of my bf's filet mignon and that too was very delicious. He ordered his medium and I just remembered it melting in my mouth.  For dessert I chose the bread pudding and my bf ordered a chocolate mousse cake. Usually my tastebuds would have favored the chocolate dessert but the bread pudding was soooooooo delicious. It was hot, cinnamon-y, and it literally disintegrated in my mouth. It was topped with vanilla ice cream which sealed the deal. I had a bite of the chocolate mousse cake and although it was delicious, the bread pudding reigns supreme.   Although we didn't pay for a single thing at our visit, we would not hesitate to come here on our own. The service was impeccable (they literally served us our meal) and the food was over-the-top delicious.",

From the moment we walked in the door, it was like my boyfriend and I turned into a king and queen. The hostess, servers, bus boys, et al. showcased the friendliest, most sincere and professional service I've ever been graced with.  We came on a Sunday night to capitalize on their \"power couple deal\"....Two salads, two entrees, and two desserts for $100. Wow.   Nothing, not even the salad croutons, dare I even say the lettuce, have I ever had a better version of.  Absolutely divine, culinary perfection.   Their pineapple cocktail is not only a spectacle, but seriously delicious. Do not dine here without trying at least one...  I could go on (and on), but just know that Del Frisco's is pure heaven on earth in the form of a beautifully kept, and wonderfully run steakhouse.  Thank you, Del Frisco's, you will not be forgotten!",

It includes choice of salads, choice of sides, 8 ounce filets, huge crab cake, and choice of desserts! YUM.   I've been to nearly every steak place in town but had always passed this place up. It's a chain and we have so many awesome steak places here.. why even try it? I found out about the $99 special and that they were associated with my favorite steak chain of all time, Sullivans, and I knew I had to try it.   The signature martini is the same one from Sullivans.. a yummy pineapple infused vodka! I adore this martini and it's a delicious way to start your evening.   Our dinners here were incredible! We are total and completely steak snobs and weren't expecting much, but these steaks were so damn good! SO MUCH better than the steaks I ate at SW Steakhouse just a few weeks ago.  If I had to be picky, the mushrooms I picked as my side were bland and boring, but this was a non-issue honestly. I was too focused on my yummy meat! The caesar salad and chocolate mousse were also excellent, as well.   For tourists, perhaps you should stick to a more famous steak place on the strip.. but for locals skip the strip and head to this place! We liked it far better than Envy or Twin Creeks or our other locals spots. We will definitely be back to sample the $99 special again this summer!",

The service was impeccable, and you'll know from the lack of sarcasm that I'm serious about that.  They flawlessly executed dinner for our party of 18, which is no small feat.    The food was tremendous, and the I didn't notice the repeated theme here that the steak seasoning was \"too salty\".  We blew through a couple of large format bottles of Silver Oak (the 3L variety) and about 30 pounds of beef.  One guy got this \"tomahawk steak\", which aside from being incredibly insensitive to Native Americans, was just altogether too big for that small asian guy to consume.  The bone stuck out 18\" from the end of the beef, making the dish resemble some sort of makeshift tomahawk.  In retrospect, maybe the name is ok.   I'll not only head back to this off-strip, meatsweat-inducing heaven, but will likely seek out the other restaurants in the small chain.",

Seasoned very well, and cooked amazingly.  I had the Prime Strip, and some others had the Prime Rib.  Everyone loved it, and I'd say the guys are all steak lovers and have had their fair share of steaks from around the country.  Sides were pretty standard for any steak house.  The only thing I wouldn't get again is the mac n cheese, it was average at best.  I do love my mac and cheese too.  Service was excellent.  Ambiance was that of a steak house, a bit on the dark side too.  I'd rank this is as the best steak I've had in Vegas or California.   So in the end 5* for the steak and 5* for service, 3* for the sides.  It is a bit on the pricey side too.",

Someone was always asking if we needed anything or if we had any questions.  And this was from many different people who worked there.  The ambiance is nice and relaxed there.  And the decor is what you would expect from a typical steak house.  My wife and I shared a 22oz Wagyu steak.  This was the best steak my wife and I have ever eaten.  It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  Each bite melted in my mouth.  We also had the lobster macaroni and cheese and potatoes Au gratin as sides.  The macaroni and cheese was great.  The potatoes were on the average side.    One nice side note, one of the hostesses offered us some fried oysters just to try for free.  Those were great!  Although my wife and I like raw oysters better, this was as good as you can get it for oysters that were fried.  Anyone looking for a steakhouse in Vegas should come here and stay off the strip.",

    "text": "Found this awesome steakhouse thanks to the handy Yelp app!  I'm so glad, since there were so many other choices on the strip and especially after having to cancel our other steakhouse reservation.  We were staying at the Venetian and the place was only 1 mile off the strip, which was not bad of a walk since the weather was so great.  We waited at the bar for the rest of our group to arrive and ordered some drinks.  The pineapple infused vodka was tasty, which they ferment themselves in small glass jars.    The bread & butter to start was really good.  But I had to stop myself, since I wanted to save room for the main event.  The Steak Tartare was also very good, probably better then most places I've had it.  The melty steak, lemon juice, and the crisp crostini all went together so well.  Next came out the steaks: the reason we came here.  I ordered the Double Eagle Bone In Strip with a side of Truffle Butter.  Once I heard \"Truffle Butter\", I didn't even hear the other few sauce choices.  I cut into my steak, upon the server's request, and it was cooked perfectly at a medium rare. Juicy, beefy, and truffle buttery steak... it was flavor country.  The Lobster Mac & Cheese side was creamy delicious and the cheesey bacon Potatoes Au Gratin were also very good.  I was tired anymore and was just happy.  One of my friends ordered roasted chicken, which he said was \"phenomenal\".  We also had a vegetarian in the group, so I was happy he was able to custom order a pasta.  They also offered an option to order larger portions of 3 sides.  From the bartender to both of our servers, the service was great.  We all had a fantastic meal and was the perfect last dinner of our trip.  It makes me sad in the pants that there isn't a Del Frisco's in Chicago.  Also, be sure to ask to check out the Bond Table before you leave.",

My third dining companion had the \"American Wagyu\" (which the waiter described as \"American Kobe beef.\")  Now I've never had Kobe beef, but if it's anything like that 38 oz monster they serve here at Del Frisco's (very well marbled, tender, and juicy), I want to try it.  (It's not always on the menu; it was a specialty item that night.)  If they have the lobster mac-and-cheese, get it.  (Not always on the menu, either, but probably the best mac-and-cheese I've ever had).   Super creamy, and not with tiny shreds of lobster like you might imagine: big, meaty chunks, many of which are claw meat.  The service was quite good.  My friend's steak was too salty for his tasty (this is something to be wary of, they do season very liberally here, unless you specify otherwise), and they brought him back a WHOLE NEW STEAK, and apologized profusely.  (\"We're so sorry, the chef must have had a very heavy hand tonight with the salt... Is this one more to your liking?\")  They have large TVs in many of the rooms playing sports games, so if you have a friend who's easily distracted, don't expect too much conversation.  A must-try.",

Even the bread they serve at the start of the meal was wonderful. Overall, that was my best dining experience in the 4 years I've lived in Vegas. The service was top notch. Our server was very attentive, always making sure our food was out on time and that we had everything we needed. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered:  *VIP signature drink- this is a pineapple martini. The pineapple is soaked in vodka for a while before its made into a martini. Wow is all I can say! *Bread loaf- this sounds silly but their bread loaf is freshly made and delicious! It's served with a whipped butter. We even took ours to go lol. *Del's salad- your basic dinner salad w/ two slices of bacon on top. Nice start.  *8oz Filet Mignon \"Oscar style\" - perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, amazing! *Crab cake w/ Cajun lobster sauce - possibly the best crabcake I've ever had. The sauce was a nice pair to it.  *Garlic broccoli (special that night)- Brocolli florets w/ fresh garlic. Simply yummy.  *Spinach supreme- creamed spinach w/ bits of bacon I believe. My boyfriend loved this.  *Strawberry Cheesecake- this cheesecake was different than any one that I've had before. It was more of a \"whipped\" cheesecake. Although I was stuffed, I snuck in some bites, it was good.   Anyone who is living or even visiting Vegas must try this place! And if Biff is available, request him. His excellent service made our dinner perfect.",

The only difference was that the service was a bit overbearing, I guess that's better than not getting any attentive service. I really can't complain about that! Food was pretty good, sauce's were extra. It's the standard steakhouse fare. I had the rib eye, which I might add was pretty good. Nicely cooked and very flavorful. The vegetables sides, were good too. Considering it is a steakhouse, the creamed spinach was good, along with the corn and etc.  Overall it is pretty solid in terms of food and service. I would definitely go back and enjoy another fine meal here.",

Fabulous upscale ambiance, extremely knowledgeable wait staff, extensive wine list, exquisite steaks and tasty side dishes combine for a very special dining experience.  We were a party of six which amplified the dining experience as this allowed for the sampling of numerous appetizers and side dishes in addition to our individual entrees. There wasn't a single item delivered to our table that wasn't perfectly prepared, presented and fully consumed.   Granted this is a small chain restaurant with locations in about 10 metro areas throughout the country. I've dined at two other locations on the east coast with the same experience. Each location customizes their menu to some extent to allow for regional tastes and to showcase local offerings.",

Cooked to perfection. I also really enjoyed the lobster mac n cheese. I've had plenty of those at various steakhouses too, and this one is one of my favorite. The lemon cake is also spectacular. It is so unbelievably moist, especially in the middle (make sure not to just eat the outside part if you're sharing with a friend). The crabcakes were good, but not really worth the price, so I wouldn't order again. The service was also good, and the James Bond table, even if you're not into the movies, is something to see. I like that this steakhouse is \"off the strip\" and not overly chaotic. It's nice to get away from all the smoking and crowds at the casinos. In summary, the food is terrific!",

The steak was the star of the evening, perfectly seasoned and prepared. We were licking the bone! They had prisoner by the glass, one of our favorite wines.

Salad was okay, not bad but nothing special. Steak was good. Perfectly seasoned and tender. The sides were good.  Notice I put \"\" around chocolate souffle because it was NOT a chocolate souffle, it was a chocolate lava cake. Heavy chocolate cake with melted center and ice cream on the side. It took the kitchen only about 5-7 min to prepare. We were surprised it was that that quick until we realized it was not the actual souffle. We thought they made a mistake so we double checked with the waitress and she said it is a souffle, just not a traditional one. However, there is a big difference between a non traditional  souffle and a chocolate lava cake. Needless to say I was very disappointed.  Drinks- ordered a cocktail and a wine. I say stick to the wine.  Price- very reasonable for a steak house, probably cheaper than other steak houses on the strip.  Service- good. Friendly staff.  Easy to get reservation.   In a nut shell, good steak, reasonable price, big wine list. BUT- if you are craving for chocolate souffle, you won't find it here.",

Not even joking, around a dozen or so servers, hosts, bussers, and food runners either served a dish, bussed our plates, folded our napkins when we left the table, or brushed the crumbs off the table.

Entrees were well prepared and all ingredients were high quality. Beautiful, well appointed room. But it is just too damned expensive.

    "text": "I love my steak.  I love FREE steak even better!  Once again, thanks to my position as a geeky network admin I got to enjoy the benefits of an informative IT seminar.  At Del Frisco's no less!  The IT seminar started off well with at least 50+ people from all over Las Vegas, IT workers from private and public institutions.  But in our minds I'm pretty sure everyone was quietly chanting to themselves, \"Go meat, meat...go meat, meat\".  I know I wasn't completely focused on 'cloud computing' and 'server virtualization'!  After about an hour of the presentation our lunch started arriving.  We started off with a basket of their fresh bread, nice and warm out of the oven.  Good stuff I tell you!  We started off with the Del Frisco house salad with fresh lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, fresh croutons, and two large slices of smoked bacon.  This was topped with their avocado ranch dressing.  Great salad!  But definitely, definitely not on the health conscious side!  The salad was fresh, and the large house cut croutons were a very nice touch.  The creaminess of the avocado ranch cut through the saltiness of the bacon quite nicely.  With a little fresh ground black pepper on top the salad was excellent.  While the IT seminar continued in the background, our next course came out.  We had the choice of either an 8 oz. filet mignon, 12 oz. ribeye, or the salmon.  Needless to say, when in a steak house do what the meatatarians do!  Salmon was out.  Medium rare ribeye was in!  However when I got my lil' slab of flesh something was amiss.  I noticed right away just by look that my steak was not cooked correctly.  Cut into it...damn!  It's near well done!  WTH?  I immediately call over the waiter and tell him I ordered medium rare ribeye.  He apologized profusely and said that he'll fix that right away.  I had to wait an extra 15 minutes for my ribeye but it was so worth it.  Waiter came back with my new steak, apologized again and said that there was a mistake in the kitchen and my previous order was at the wrong table.  Wow, who orders an expensive cut of meat well done?  For shame, I tell you!    That steak was like buttah!  Well, actually after broiling it was topped with a pat of butter as well, nicely melting on top of my ribeye.  So tender!  So juicy!  Seasoned just right with salt and pepper.  No steak sauce needed when the quality of the meat is great!  My ribeye also came accompanied with some of Del Frisco's chateau potatoes (similar to garlic mashed potatoes) that was good as well.  Very creamy and silky, you could tell the potatoes had a lot of butter in them.  I took a few bites, but concentrated on using all my allowed calories for the day on that lovely ribeye.  Done!  That ribeye was PWND!  Near the end of out IT seminar dessert came out.  We were treated to a large serving of bread pudding.  I was treated to a large serving of GUILT.  Calorie consumption for day had easily exceeded the 2500 mark.  But it looked so good!  What would Tony Horton and my friends at P90X say?  I don't really recall, but up went my spoon!  The bread pudding was pretty good, very sweet and indulgent with their rum laced light caramel sauce.  And boy could I taste the butter!  After four bites I finally put my spoon down.  Whew!          Fattening lunch to say the least.  I was a wee bit slower trying to do an ungodly number of pullups that day for P90X.  But it was worth it!    Much thanks to the tech company hosting the seminar for the good eats!  Del Frisco...great food and great service!  Service was excellent and attentive, and the immediate fix to my mi-steak (get it?  LOL) was much appreciated.  I will definitely have to visit here to have a real sit down dinner in their dining room!  Though this time I will have to foot the bill.  Aww, sad me.",

The restaurant has plenty of parking and valet service too. The hostess was friendly and allowed us to wait at the bar until the rest of our party arrived. The decor was nice and it was dim lit inside. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were served by the waiter to each of us at the table.  Since it was late, our party was able to share a few steaks and the seared tuna. The waiters didn't seem to mind since we weren't starving, not to mention we were going dancing immediately after dinner so we didn't want to stuff our faces. Fyi the cokes are served from a small glass bottle so no refills. The restaurant has rooms for private parties.",

    "text": "First let me just say, if you are dining on the cheap, this is NOT the place for you.  Average steak is $40+ and the bone in Rib Eye was $65.  So we were not dining on the cheap but still, if it says Market Price and you don't ask, then just like us fools, it's your bad...did not realize the Seafood Plateau was going to be $165.00; granted the crab legs were large, and it had a couple of snow claws, but the rest was just regular cold shrimp (like 4) and oysters on the half, maybe another 4. It was enough to share, and I guess you pay a premium for fresh fish when you are in the middle of the dessert...or well, anyway just ask.  The thing to come to Del Frisco's for is the meat.  They have great meat and they season and cook it well.  As well or as rare as you want it, that's how you are going to get it.  The sides are served family style and there is plenty to share, once you agree on what to share (I love creamed spinach, but I was the only one at the table to love creamed spinach, so I got some anyway!).    The ambience is dark steakhouse, and the servers are professionally friendly.  They have an excellent wine list and their som is more then happy to help you find something to fit your meal and your pocket book.  LindySez:  All in all a great meal...just remember to ask the prices so you don't get sticker shock at checkout!",

The group I went with, we all shared the lobster mac n cheese, onion rings and mashed potatoes.    If you're ever in Vegas and want to eat a nice mouth watering steak, look no further and book your reservation with Del Frisco's.    FYI - the restaurant is off the strip but not too far.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to try this place on my latest trip to LV.  I have to say, I thought it was great.  The original intent was to go the cheap route and get the 'power couple' meal which is like 99 bucks for two.  However after checking out the menu my friend and I opted for the more expensive route.  For appetizers got the crab cakes and the shrimp, both of these were excellent.  For dinner I got a menu special which was Filet Mignon prepared two ways which I now am naming 'Dueling Filets'.  Both of these filets were melt in your mouth delicious and prepared with two different sauces.   The creamed spinach was also great.    Service was impeccable.  We had 2 waiters at all times, perhaps one was a trainee.  When they brought the food there were 4 wait staff attending, situating our food and making sure we were taken care of.  We were also checked on by a manager who asked us how we were doing and of course I let it slip that it was my friend's birthday so we got a complimentary huge slice of their lemon chiffon cake.  That was also delicious.  That signature VIP drink with infused pineapple was delicious.  I could have sat there all night drinking those things and considering how much I spent gambling later perhaps I should have just sat there.  They have huge jars of the soaking pineapple decorating the restaurant.  I should have taken one of those home.  The final bill wasn't cheap, but this is definitely a great experience with some great food.   I wish I could go here more often.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. The ambiance was like your typical old-fashioned steakhouse with cherry wood panels and old-looking lamp shades. I came here wanting to try their huge Kobe Beef steak, but they didn't have it! DARN! So...I settled for something else...  My boyfriend ordered the $60 26 oz. Double Eagle Strip, their signature steak, and I ordered the $45 Strip Steak (16 oz., which was huge to me, so I only finished half!). For our sides, we ordered the mushrooms and their special veggie of the night: green beans (cooked in garlic, butter, and wine and seasoned with pepper).  The service was excellent from start to finish; when we received our steaks, the waiter asked us to cut the middle of our steaks to see if they were satisfactory to our tastes. The sides were served by the waiters too, instead of us serving ourselves. We never had to ask for water to be refilled, as someone was constantly watching all of the tables.  The quality of the steaks was very good, and they were lightly seasoned with just salt and pepper. There was a nice crispy texture to the steaks. I really enjoyed it (although, I am still a bigger fan of Delmonico's!). The mushrooms were very tasty as well, more enjoyable than the green beans.  Since the waiter knew it was my birthday, they gave me a HUGE piece of lemon cake with a candle on it (their signature dessert!) at the end of our meal. It was delicious! (If I wasn't so full, I would have finished it!) The cake was nice and moist, the lemon taste wasn't overpowering, and the frosting was just sweet enough! SOOO GOOD!  When we were ready to leave, I was curious about their world-famous cigar lounge, but the hostess informed me that they had to close it down because of some anti-smoking law that passed last year. Now all you can do is buy cigars. Since I was bummed about the cigar lounge, the hostess showed us the James Bond table! It was soooo cool! The table's top opened up like flower petals and pushed upwards to reveal a nice display of Napa wine bottles etched with James Bond movies like Dr. No and Tomorrow Never Dies (the last one to be etched!). The theme song was playing as it opened up too! It was SOOO COOL! The table is valued over 1.25 million dollars or more now (I forgot how much they bought it for). It's a must see at Del Friscos!  A great steakhouse for those old-fashioned, quality steaks!",

The sesame bread here is served hot out of the oven and really good with the garlic butter spread.    I had the bone in rib eye (medium rare) and it was DELICIOUS!!!  It came on a greased 500 degree plate and there was a nice exterior crust of cracked pepper and salt.  You can taste the richness of the beef and was super tender.  For our side we shared an order of au gratin potatoes (it was a little too cheesy for my liking but still really good).  Oh I forgot to mention we started off with the crab cake appetizer.  LOTS of crab minimal filler.  For dessert we had the strawberry cheese cake.    Over great experience here at Del Friscos.   Probably one of the best steaks I've had in Vegas thus far.",

First of all, we have the most wonderful waitress who takes care of us every year.  Cynea treats us so well, we always make sure to let the staff know we must have her when we make our reservation.  She feels like family to us at this point!  Then there is the food - holy cow!  Everything we have ever ordered is so amazing - always cooked and seasoned to perfect!  I read through a few other reviews here and all I can say is I have no idea where some of these people were eating, but it sure wasn't Del Frisco's!  One review talks about TVs in the dining room and rowdy drunks.  I have no idea what they are talking about!  We have never seen any such thing!!  This restaurant is pure fine dining.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Del Frisco's experience - you will be very glad you did!!",

Interior seems a bit dated but sort of adds to the atmosphere of the place.  Complimentary Bread: 5 - warm and delicious - crusty outside with a soft and moist inside.  16oz Prime Ribeye: 4.5 - flavorful and juicy - slightly overcooked (order medium, arrived closer to medium well) but still juicy - seasoned well with nice seared outside  Shared the following sides among the table: Asparagus: 4 - well seasoned and not overcooked  Sauteed Fresh Mushrooms: 4 - sauteed whole mushrooms - seasoned well and not overly buttery  Chateau Potatoes: 4 - mashed potatoes - nice compliment to the steak  Overall great steak place.  Steaks can shared (they will even split it for you).  I ordered the 16oz ribeye and it was a little to much steak for me (but I'm not the biggest meat eater).  Be careful not to eat too much of the delicious bread or you won't have room for the steak.  Come ready to be filled with excellent eats.",

They have this thing on their menu called the carpetbagger steak, its like a small ribeye that comes with potatoes, is not that expensive and its just the right size. Most of the time when I sit down to a steak dinner, I know I'm going to have to order something that I will never even dent, and it will be so expensive. They have this amazing lemon cake for dessert that I'm sure they put crack into, and the creamed spinach is seriously the best I have ever had.

From the get go, this place is class and a True old school steak house. I was at a table with about 16 people and our wait staff was on it. Never had to wait for anything and they just kept everything coming. I had the filet on the bone (off the menu special) and it was epic...one of the best filets I've eaten. I do have to say that the lobster mac & cheese was a bit runny for me but that might just be a \"me\" thing. The flavor was great though. I really liked the onion rings...nearly the size of a donut. And the Lemon Cake....so tasty. I enjoyed it so much that after dining there on a Friday, I talked our group into returning the following Thursday and yes, I had the same damn thing! We also had the crab legs which were more flavorful that crab I've had before.  All in all, it WILL be on my agenda every time I visit Vegas!",

This place has officially topped the 5-8 nice steak houses I've been too.  Brianna L and I both ordered the Fillet and shrimp special of the day that had a southwestern sauce drizzled over it.  Cooked to perfection (yes they asked us to slice into it to get our approval of the cooking) we ate every single bite (they cut the fillet fresh so you can get any size you want, I think it was $2 per ounce over the base cost of an $38-8 ouncer).  We also ordered the potato's Au gratin to split and we didn't have room for desert sadly.  The sommelier as mentioned previously didn't look older than 25 but was very courteous, friendly (we are a younger couple so he wasn't to stuffy to us about the wine), and knowledgeable.  I am not too into wine (the wine book was in a ~3\" binder, quite exstensive) so he brought me the scotch/bourbon menu to where I had a nice pour of Blantons with our Calamari.  Service was top notch:  food brought out at appropriate times, great recommendations, prompt arrival with check, etc.  They also send you a post card thanking you for your visit if you give them your address.  I would highly recommend this fine establishment.  I plan on visiting their other locations if I am ever in TX, CO, NY, FL, or NC.  Yes they did have crumb scrapers, score!!!",

Thanks to Chip, a native of Fort Worth and regular at the restaurant there, he ordered appetizers and side dishes, and even dessert for the table of 12. We had a variety of shrimp that were perfectly seasoned and chilled, Cajun calamari, and everything was wonderful. The service was stellar, with food delivery well orchestrated. The entrees were amazing, the portions reasonable, and the side dishes large enough to share and delicious. I had the filet trio, perfectly rare and tender, the three compliments were delicious. I loved the asparagus. Service at the end fell off a bit as our waitress had another large group arrive. I was hoping for coffee with my dessert, but no small error could take away from the wonderful meal. It was a much smaller restaurant than I expected, a lot of tables and chairs in a small space. The bar area where we waited was very close, and you could not pass through. It would be wonderful to have a Del Frisco's close to home, but add it to your list if you are in Fort Worth or Las Vegas. It's worth the splurge.",

    "text": "I just want to state..that this steak is the bomb.  I mean..its expensive as hell but its so good.  The bone rib-eye was 50 bucks and the rib eye itself was 42.  The steak comes out on a sizzling plate like ruth chris but the steak is so juicy and has so much flavor.  I'd definetly go back as this is one of the best teaks I've ever eaten.  This place loses a star on its appetizers..I got the mac and cheese and creamed spinach it was below average and kind of pricey    The enviroment is cool as they have a live piano player playing music from the oceans 11,12,13 movies.  They wait staff is very nice and it kinda has that musky Frank Sinatra feel.    I'd recommend this place if you are winning in Vegas and got some chips to throw around",

    "text": "We were recommended Del Friscos by a friend for a romantic dinner for two and it exceeded our expectations: - to begin, they have a great cocktail list. Although it is pricey, the whole meal is quite pricey anyway - great wine list, decent prices if you buy a bottle - BEST steak I have ever eaten. Slices like butter and seriously melts in your mouth (no exaggeration). We didn't want the steak to end and were savoring every moment! - Staff is very friendly and made our experience very memorable. We went on Valentine's Day (which meant it was crazy busy) but we could barely tell because our waiter gave us the right amount of attention. He even took some cute pictures of us for a memory  We will be going back for sure next time we are in Sin city!",

    "text": "One of my favorite steakhouses ( musashi ) just happened to be closed when I went. I was craving a steak and noticed that there was a steakhouse across the street called Del Frisco's. I usually do homework on restaurants before I go so I can have an idea of what to expect. Decided to just go and I was happy I did! The ambiance is great. The decor is modern and chic. The steak was amazing! They offered a 32oz bone in wagyu rib eye! I was in heaven! It was very tender and juicy! You can taste the quality of the meat with every bite! The service was great. Very attentive and polite and courteous. After dinner they asked how everything was and I said it was amazing. They asked for my address so they could thank me and remember to not forget about them.  A few weeks passed and I get a letter thanking me for trying them out and hoped I had a great experience. The letter was hand written and added such a touch of class to the restaurant that I will definitely be a returning customer from here on.",

We had a party of 13 this year meeting up in Vegas, from Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles.    First the good: The service there was amazing.  We had our own room, and the wait staff was very attentive to our needs.  We ordered sides, and they were served to us individually.  A very nice touch.  Overall, the service there was impeccable.  The OK: Maybe I'm spoiled with Ruth's Chris (which we enjoy quite on occasion) but my bone-in ribeye was comparable, but not as good as what I've had at Ruth's.  They undercooked mine significantly (medium-rare, I ordered it medium well), but had no problems with getting it more done.  The sides also, in my opinion, were average at best.  The service was great, but the food itself was only good, not great.  For the price you're paying for Del Frisco's, you'd expect it to be better.  The bummer: So apparently they had to take out the cigar lounge about 3 years ago to comply with the smoking law.  Booo!  After dinner, the wait staff took us to take a look at the mechanical table with the James Bond 007 hand-painted bottles and the wine racks.  Was pretty cool!",

And the green beans, normally you cant say anything good about them, but here they were great.     Here's a tip, ask to see the James Bond table, you will be amused and amazed.

The tomato and onion salad consisted of huge slices of under-ripe tomatoes and huge hunks of hot onion that no one could eat.  The rib-eye was OK but not spectacular.  I can name two dozen other steakhouses in Phoenix and Las Vegas that far surpass the food here.  Hopefully we were there on a bad night but we don't plan to give it a second chance--not for the prices charged.",

They even take your desert order when you order your main course.  They didn't even ask if we were finished with our meal even though there was still food on our plates.    I would go back again but I would probably give our server a heads up on the rushed service.",

    "text": "Totally worth trying if you take advantage of their $99 Power Couple Special - each person gets an order of crab cake, 8oz filet mignon (you can substitute the steak and pay the difference), choice of salad, 2 side dishes and dessert.  FOOD: Del's salad is what you would expect of the house salad. It comes with their homemade dressing, but it was nothing to rave about. The filet mignon was rich in flavor with a light crust on the outside. I ordered mine medium well and it was a little too well for my liking. However, the bf ordered his medium. I took a bite of his and it was cooked perfectly - juicy, moist, and tender. The crab cakes were so good - probably one of the best crab cake I have ever had. The portion was on the small side, but it was plenty. For our sides, we both ordered the spinach supreme and potato au gratin. They were well seasoned and tasted better than most places, but it didn't stand out. While browsing their menu, we also saw the lobster mac and cheese and just HAD to order it. I heart lobster so my opinion may be biased, but I think this dish was awesome. There was a little bit of crust on the top, which gave it a nice crunchy texture that complimented the creaminess from the cheese. For dessert, the bf got the chocolate mousse, and I ordered the cheesecake with strawberries. Both dishes are huge - at least twice the size you would normally get. I thought the bf's dessert was so-so, but he seemed to really enjoy it. I, on the other hand, loved my cheesecake - very rich and creamy.  SERVICE: Superb! The staff is super friendly. There were about 8 different people helping us so there was always someone there when you need them. Even the manager came by to check on us and say 'Hello' even though I think she was just doing it because it's her job. I've been to other fine dining locations and never once did the manager come by to greet us so it was a nice touch.   AMBIANCE: I guess you can call it intimate. I think they were trying to go for a romantic setting with the dim interior and the live pianist. I wish it wasn't so dim inside because I forgot to bring my camera so the only thing I had on me was my iPhone, and my pictures didn't turn out as well as I'd like due to the low lighting.  This place does not skimp on quality or portions. My bf can eat like there's no tomorrow and he left here stuffed. What's also nice is that the crowd here is not pretentious one bit. So whether you're here to celebrate or just looking for a good steakhouse, this is a great escape from all the Vegas glitz and glamour. You'll get your money's worth, easily. It's better than throwing down $100 at a game of roulette, craps or anything of the sort!",

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets.  I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank.  For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for.  You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a>   My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a>  The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a> The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a>  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye.   For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them.  I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok.  The baked potato looked good. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a>  The crabcakes were pretty good.  My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light.  My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more.   We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts! We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts.  The bread pudding was the best-  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a> Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a> Chocolate mousse was delicious. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4...</a> One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already.   Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes.   I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!   * A little bit off the strip off Paradise by Ruth's Chris and Mortons.",

My order also came with two very large loafs of bread.  There were probably enough onion rings for three people and they were fried to perfection.  The rib eye was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The best part was the lobster Mac. Easily one of the best things I've ever eaten! Would definitely recommend it and I will be a return customer several times over.",

    "text": "GREAT! The food, the service, and the ambiance were all superb.   As relatively small eaters we ordered the calamari, two small filets, corn, and a buttercake with ice cream.  The calamari was the best we have had anywhere.  The filets were as good or better than any top end steakhouse. The corn was fabulous.  The dessert was an amazing finish.  The service team worked together as a well oiled machine. Benny, our primary, was exceptional (btw he looks like a young Phil Simms and was at least as good at his job as Phil was as a QB).  Again the whole experience was rounded out by great teamwork.  The restaurant and bar were absolutely beautiful.  Be sure to see the James Bond table.  Yep, we'll be back.  Thank you!",

The night my fiance and I got engaged, we had dinner here with my boss.  but before he showed up. we had a few drinks at the bar! the bartenders were SO helpful and sweet and one even bought us a drink as a congratulations!   their VIP martini was amazing. clementine vodka infused by Hawaiian pineapples. SO delicious!  we each ordered the prix fixe and boss ordered the giant wagyu ribeye! the steaks were all amazing!   the sides were pretty good as well. We had the crab cake, scallops, and mashed potatoes. and sauteed mushrooms.  The crab cake was just meh. too heavy tasting. I really didn't see what all the hype was about.  the scallops were delicious!  Sauteed mushrooms were sauteed mushroom. :/  the mashed potatoes were awesome!  It was my fiance's birthday so they brought us out a HUGE slice of their lemon cake. absolutely AMAZING!  I loved the food and the service!  We will be back! :)",

Our server William was great other than failing to give us the rest of the food we paid for, he even sent a thank you card in the mail which was much appreciated!

    "text": "I'v eaten a lot of different cuts of meat at a lot of different places, and if the Double-Eagle at Del Frisco's isn't the best steak I've ever had, it is darn close.  My fellow diners who ordered an off the menu bone-in filet and tomahawk waygu ribeye were both envious.  It is literally one of those game changing entrees that makes you not want to eat something similar anywhere else, because you know it will fall short.  I literally cannot wait to go back and get another.  It isn't uncommon to find a superstar dish but feel let down by the other courses....not the case at Del Frisco's.  I put their calamari in the top 1-3 calamari plates I've had.  The balance of sweet and heat is perfect.  It leaves an after taste that makes you immediately want to go back for more.  I could probably say the same for the crab cake app.  Virtually all crab and a terrific cajun lobster sauce.  I'm not a fan of cajun flavors in general, but the sauce was not overpowering and a great compliment to the crab.  I'd also recommend the marinated shrimp or the shrimp with the remoulade.  Both were worthy of bread dipping.  Honestly, I can't speak much about the sides because i had a few bites of a few different ones, but was so hypnotized by my steak that I didn't pay them much mind.  I also can't say anything about the desserts because by then I was stuffed.  However, the others I dined with all said they were terrific (sorry don't recall what was ordered).  All in all, when someone tells you this is the best place to get a steak in Vegas, they aren't kidding.",

    "text": "Had the feel of a tired old steakhouse, even though I've been anticipating a visit to Del Frisco's after many visits to LV in the past,  we finally went while we were visiting during last year's LVI tournament.  Perhaps I was expecting too much after placing DF's on a pedestal, and once I found out that it was a chain, I had already placed it in the same class as a Ruth's Chris or a Morton's.  No knocking any of these places but I had already wondered if it was going to be any good without being held under higher scrutiny like it would if it were located within a large hotel on the strip (i.e. they would have more to answer to)...  For such a highly rated steakhouse, I was expecting something fantastic, but everything felt mediocre and flat, the food, the service, everything;  there were no extenuating wow factors that I could remember.  I remember feeling a bit hovered over by the small army of servers,  it seemed like everyone from the wait staff to the maitre d'hotel were interested in how well our meal was going, like it was part of a script.  When they brought out the food, they did it in force with 3 or 4 people as was likewise the case when they cleared the table.  It reminded me of the scene in \"Back to the Future\" where all the gas station attendants rushed to help the car that had pulled up in the full service line.  I don't want to sound like I didn't appreciate the attention but it was a bit overwhelming, even patronizing actually.  A reviewer had mentioned that the service was obsequious and I can understand where they were coming from...  The food was ok, but that's all.  There was nothing wrong but it all felt a little ordinary, particularly in the presentation.  When we ordered a pair of tomahawks, that's what we got:  a couple of hunks of meat on a plate each <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#6ce1KEjWiS7SCAawNtnoCw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>.  Again, the server would stand there and ask you to cut into the meat to make sure the preparation and color temperature was to your liking <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#GHOGKPtodnKfcJiXW0E82Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a> -- talk about pressure to respond.  But then again, I think they do the same to everyone so it's more about following protocol than actually having a personal stake (no pun intended) in asking...  Actually, I don't recall if they asked my wife if she liked her dish, Beef Medallions with chateau potatoes and red wine demi glace,  but she would confide to me that she later that she thought the presentation was horrible and terribly pedestrian.  I would venture to say that she expected more but probably bit her tongue about displaying her disappointment... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  The sides were ok too, but uninteresting to look at.  The Lobster Mac & Cheese <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#bK7v5hTxNrI8L5bq3XBdkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a> had lobster meat that was chopped so fine that it went AWOL,  The Asparagus <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#57TUP_OG9oVuXY9jyJ7Bng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a> was alright but bland, and the Sauteed Mushrooms <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#kKx7_h7rYPm0QxOT_ZFHOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a> were watery.  The chopped salad looked more like a wet slaw <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#VW0JhBfhDTaIgdLYV_iDqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>.  At least the signature VIP vodka's were stiff and strong, even with the presence of fresh pineapple in them... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#G8ALiCXkhxqAUBPdkv4HkQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>  The James Bond table turned out to be little more than a cheesy tourist attraction relegated to a side room near the entry <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2?select=1UvX8lVe7ELO41TKUUv2Ew#MPcAmrFLZprZIx6BftiUUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/del-...</a>.

If this place was less expensive, I would give it a higher rating.  I also hate when places only have mostly really expensive bottles of wine on the wines list. I mean crazy expensive.   Steaks are typical prime grade steaks, but not cooked with that really high heat so they don't have that char that my favorite places have.  Decor is starting to look dated.

    "text": "When the bill is $320 for 4 people (2 split an entree), the food better be good.  Del Frisco is all image and no chef.  It's a charade and the only reason this place is still open is millions of people visit Vegas everyday and if they can 20 covers that visit for the first time, they can continue to put out a bad product.   The night started off well because everyone is friendly and they do have top notch service in the front.  In the back is where this place is suffering.  Whoever is the quality control person for the food going out needs to read this.  I would be okay if we only had one bad plate, but 7 out of the 10 plates we had were very bad and shouldn't have been served.  We're celebrating two birthdays and it's difficult to be that person to make a fuss and spoil the evening.  We just rolled with it and figured our only way to make things right is to Yelp about it and prevent others from making our mistake.  When we were seated, a guy greets us and gives us the rundown of the menu specials.  He really pushed specific items on the menu which we didn't order.  Had we known in advance that our Ribeye was going to be 60% gristle, we would have understood this greeting speech to really mean everything on the menu sucks except the stuff I'm telling you about.    Plate #1: The bread is very good. It's a full loaf that's not sliced and the way to eat it is to pull it apart with your hands.  It's good, but we didn't want to fill up on bread.  Plate #2: Crabcake was lump crab that had no binder, so you really can't call it a cake.  Lump crab with a sauce. It was good, but a crab cake is something you think is grilled and has a crispy edge to it.  So, for a crab cake, it's a zero. For lump crab, it's a 5.  Plate #3: Shrimp cocktail.  It's about 15 jumbo shrimp with 3 different sauces.  All of the sauces could have been out of a jar and the shrimp was overcooked tough.  Another zero stars.  Plate #4: Caeser Salad:  This was good.  The croutons were homemade buttery and crunchy good.  But.... it's a salad that isn't that hard to make.    Plate #5: Asparagus.  Somebody needs to tell the chef they need to break off the woody part of the stalk.  The tops were cooked prefectly, but you end up leaving the woody part on the plate.    Plate #6: Au Gratin.  Diced potato with some cheese.  It was meh.    Plate #7: Osso Buco.  The pasta was cooked perfect, but the star of the show was dry.  It had a nice tomato based spicey sauce, but the meat just wasn't moist.  It was falling off the bone tender, but leaves a dry taste in the mouth.  The marrow was the only really good part of the shank.  Plate #8: Tuna.  This was the WTF item on the table.  It had zero presentation. It's was just a thin slice of Ahi Tuna that was breaded with sesame seeds and flashed grilled.  The tuna was bland and didn't have that sushi quality flavor and texture.  If I had to guess, I would say this fish was frozen at some point instead of being fresh.  Just a dissapointment.  Plate #9: Ribeye.  As mentioned, 60% of this steak was tough and gristly.  My mom and sister split this item and the staff cut it in half for us.  Sister ended up with 50% of the gristle meaning she had no real steak to eat. Mom ended up with the eye which was tender.  Plate #10: Banana Bread Pudding:  This was good.  Crispy exterior with a nice scoop of vanilla on top.",

It is a huge, prime, juicy, well seasoned and perfectly cooked patty topped with your choice of blue or cheddar cheese and the classic accouterments of lettuce, red onion, tomato, and a surprise of sweet pickles.  It is a really really really good burger.   It also comes with fresh cut fry/chips.  Holy moly! The scallops were generous as well.  4 big scallops with a creamy spinach sauce.

That was plenty of food for two. In fact, we had to bag the rest of the steak and some brussel sprouts. Everything was delish! We ended dinner with a very fluffy chocolate souffle and a double espresso.  The greatest highlight of the night was meeting Anthony, the Sommelier. He went above and beyond what was necessary of him. Being wine lovers, my husband and I shared great conversations with Anthony. After dinner, Anthony was kind enough to offer us a tour of their wine cellar and the incredible \"Bond Table\"! Thanks Anthony! You're awesome!",

    "text": "Steakhouses are usually a dime a dozen in resort/vacation areas. They're often dimly lit, wood and leather upholstered venues, crammed full of stuffy businessmen looking to impress their partners/clients/customers with overpriced meals.  Del Frisco's is a bit different. In all the best ways.  For one, I was able to get a reservation quickly on OpenTable. Kudos for accommodating my party during a busy convention week. But two, there was a welcome variety of patrons. Business folk, people in jeans, and there were, gasp, even women here. A rare sight in stuffy, overtly masculine steakhouses. I'm really not saying that from a sleazy point of view, but rather, I appreciate diversity.  The floorpan is open, with a nice, accommodating bar. My party and I shared the oysters, onion rings and spinach appetizers/sides. For entrees, we each had an offering from the red meat portion of the menu.  But let's talk about the onion rings. These things are gargantuan. Like, a third of an onion big, lightly battered. Seriously the best onion rings I've ever had. The spinach was creamy and delicious (and worked pretty well as a topping for a few bites of steak).  As our entrees were delivered, we were challenged to verify the temperature of our meat. Either would've satisfied any steak aficionado. Quality of the meat was terrific and made for a wonderful meal.  My filet medallions were great and I appreciated the variety in preparation between the trio (crab/florentine/straight up).  The prices were extremely reasonable for this sort of establishment. Cocktails (I had an Old Fashioned) were delicious.  I highly recommend Del Frisco's for steak lovers of all sorts.",

    "text": "**3.75 Stars**  Very popular and old school steakhouse located off the strip.   Despite their location, clearly one of the most popular steakhouses in Vegas and for good reason: their top notch Prime steaks and excellent, albeit very pricey, seafood.   The vibe is very retro with lots of hardwood, live piano music, and great wine and martinis.  The James Bond table (ask your waiter for a demo) is a perfect match for this place.  Our order:  Seafood plateau - a sampling of their most popular items and priced at an incredible $55/person.  Admittedly though, the Alaskan crab legs (5) were fantastic.  Fresh and sweet.  The Florida stone crab claw was impressively sized but the meat was not as good as the crab legs.  The oysters and shrimp were very good.   Crab cake with lobster sauce - the appetizer only includes one crab cake and is overpriced.  It is almost entirely crab meat though and tasty.    Bone-in Prime Ribeye - cooked perfectly medium rare and seasoned nicely while letting the meat flavor shine.  They do steak right and we shared the 22 ounces.   Lobster Mac and Cheese - the much hyped side dish was delicious and creamy BUT had very little lobster meat.  Just a few small tidbits here and there.  Good, but if you want a Lobster Mac and Cheese, go to Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino and they will show you real lobster chunks.    Service was friendly and on point though it's busy here and the waitstaff are clearly running around.  They were kind enough to throw a dessert in (their lemon cake) for a special occasion.    Del Frisco's was a great steakhouse and definitely worth the trip off the strip.  The steaks were excellent and a few of the seafood items were truly exceptional.    Prices are high but Del Frisco's is the real deal.  It may not match my favorite steakhouse and restaurant of all time, Alexander's Steakhouse (Cupertino), but I wouldn't hesitate coming here again.   Del Frisco's accepts credit cards including Amex.",

    "text": "My 2015 Birthday Heaven!!!  Del Frisco's Double Eagle just opened in DC about a month or so ago, and I've been dying to go.  I've been to Del Frisco Grille and enjoyed the atmosphere and the meal, so naturally I couldn't wait for the Double Eagle to open.  Unfortunately I still haven't had a chance to go, so when I took a recent trip to Vegas to celebrate my birthday and found out the restaurant was around the corner from our hotel, I had to go.  We were greeted by the very friendly staff and seated immediately.  Our server was very pleasant, provided excellent service throughout our meal, was very familiar with the menu and suggested some excellent eating and drinking choices.  For appetizers we started with oysters and the crab cake with lobster sauce......deeeeeelicious.  Our server explained that they offered east coast and west coast oysters and described the flavor differences between the two.  We went with the east coast oysters which were a very nice size and although I'm not an oyster connoisseur, I enjoyed them.  The crab cake was broiled, all crabmeat and super good.  That sauce gave it an extra little kick.  There was a trio of filets (3-4oz filets, one with brie, one with a jumbo grilled shrimp and grilled scallop and the third was a filet oscar with crab and asparagus) on the specials menu, so I opted for the trio as my main course with a baked potato.  The filets were all cooked perfectly, super tender and delicious.....it was steak heaven.  The potato was huge and definitely large enough to share.  It was my birthday so throughout our dinner, members of the staff would stop by and wish me happy birthday.  The staff also took the time to present me with a special birthday card signed by everyone.  Our server concluded our meal with a complimentary slice of lemon cake that I had to take with me back to our room because I was beyond stuffed.  But before we left, we had to take advantage of the outdoor patio area which offered lounge and dining seating.  We took up a position on the lounge chairs, had a few cocktails and smoked some cigars while our food settled.  This will definitely be a regular dining spot on my list when I visit Vegas and I can't wait to try their DC location now that I'm back home.  Oh, before I forget....there's one thing that I didn't like, but not enough to take away any stars.  They have a bowl of candy for guests to take as they are entering or leaving the restaurant.  The candy is not wrapped and there is a spoon for you to dip into the candy and pour some in your hand.  I can't tell you how many people I saw put their bare hands into the bowl to dig out candy or search for a particular flavor.  Disgusting!!!!  Hopefully management will re-think this idea.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try Del Frisco's for some time so was happy we finally made it here.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye steak which I have to say was pretty stellar. It was pretty close to my fav one at Mastro's.  Unfortunately, the other items we ordered just didn't stack up to the steak.   The lobster mac n cheese was okay but something was missing. I've had really great lobster mac n cheese at several places before and this one just tasted off somehow. Even though it had chunks of lobster in it, it was just missing that overall lobster flavor that others seem to have. I wouldn't order again even though it seemed fairly priced.  The spinach side was good but very watery -- the texture was severely lacking. Again, I wouldn't order this if I return. My friends ordered the crab cake appetizer (just one cake) and they were happy with it. It was a good size with mostly lump crab meat and they really liked the flavor.    Service was very good. Ambiance was okay...truthfully, it was kinda dead when we were there on a Friday night so was quiet and very mellow. It did seem to be picking up as we were leaving.    We also got see the James Bond table which was a really neat little touch. If you're a fan of the movies it might be worth the visit just for that. :-)",

    "text": "My husband and I just literally got done with dinner and I couldn't wait to write a review on this place. We came here to celebrate our 15 year anniversary and every year we like to try new steakhouses to compare to our favorite one at SW at the Wynn and well it looks like we found a competitor.  First off, service- exceptional! From the moment we walked past the valet we were already greeted. Then we came in and there were about 5 hostess at the stand and all greeted us with a smile. After being seated, we were greeted by our server Joe and a few other who accompanied him like Nick, but I must say, it is people like him that make special occasions like these a memorable and special one. From start to finish, he made our dining experience a very comfortable one. He gave us all the recommendations on the menu, all in which we followed and we are very glad we did.   Food- Amazing! This was the very first time we were able to have an actual full course meal without being overly stuffed. We had the calamari, followed by a three course meal that was recommended by Joe. The lettuce in our salad was crispy and dressing was just the perfect amount, not too much or too little. The entree and sides, oh my goodness. Where do I start? We both ordered steak, rib eye and porterhouse. It was absolutely mouth watering and literally melted in your mouth. It was accompanied by a truffle butter topping and we had mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as sides. My husband couldn't stop raving about how juicy the steak was. Then came desert and again we asked Joe for recommendations and he suggested the butter cake with pecan ice cream. So glad we listened to him the whole night.  This is definitely a place worth trying and to worth every penny. It is our new favorite steakhouse and will be back for sure for many more occasions!",

We all got the Del's salad, amazing.  It had two slices of perfectly cooked bacon.  I'm not a huge bacon fan and I loved it.  We all got an assortment of steaks (rib eye, filet mignon, waygu, specials, etc).  My absolute favorite was the tomahawk waygu steak (ribeye on huge bone), it was $90 but worth every penny.  The most tender, flavorful steak I've ever had in my life.  My brother ordered this but I would probably get it the next time.  We also ordered scallops, lobster mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, and corn as our sides.  All were good.    We were stuffed but they gave us a huge slice of lemon cake for my dad's bday.  It was so good.  Light, fluffy, and perfect way to end a heavy meal.  Think any other dessert might have pushed me over the edge because I had a burger, fries and shake for lunch that day (recommend having a light lunch).  Love this place!",

It was quite loud and busy inside so we decided to sit outside. We all had ribeye which was seasoned just right as we ordered. In my opinion they have the best steak around, cause they don't overdo with seasonings, but it is seasoned such that the flavor of the meat comes through. For dessert we had a chocolate mousse with really thick whipped cream. It was really great...  Overall - great food and service with an excellent wine list and exceptional service.

    "text": "REAL RATING: 3.5 stars  Del Frisco comes with a lot of hype. Branded on Yelp with a 4.5-star overall rating and over 900 reviews, you can't help but expect nothing but the best. However, instead of Del Frisco's food being the star, it was their service.   SERVICE: Absolutely excellent. It's what you expect with their menu prices. Our server (I think her name was Eileen) was awesome. She had a lot of personality and was extremely attentive. However, she wasn't overbearing. Our table consisted of 10 guys and Eileen knew exactly how to work us - with subtle flirting and amazing service. The rest of the staff was great as well.   ONION RINGS ~ 3.5 stars ~ $13: Beer battered, thick cut. Good, not great. Honestly, I think the onion ring stack at Yard House is better.   SPINACH SUPREME ~ 4 stars ~ $12.5: Just cream spinach but executed perfectly. Not TOO rich but very buttery. Seasoned perfectly. A must for a side.   LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE ~ 3 stars ~ $18: I think throwing lobster in mac & cheese is a crime. I've never been to a place where the lobster comes through past the richness of the mac & cheese. Del Frisco's is no different. Remove the lobster and drop the price by $9 and I'm sure more people will feel better about it.   32oz. TOMAHAWK BONE-IN WAGYU RIBEYE (MED-RARE) ~ 3 stars ~ $95: My steak was slightly undercooked. Instead of taking it back to the kitchen, the guy who served me my plate just cut it and put the super red part on the piping hot plate to cook it. Uhhhhh.... come on, what about the center of the steak? The steak wasn't as tender as you would expect with a $95 price tag. However, it was seasoned well and charred perfectly on the outside. 4 stars for flavor, 2 stars for execution.   I wasn't impressed with the food one bit. In fact, I was pretty disappointed. I didn't get anything close to what I paid for. However, their service was excellent. Would I ever go back? Absolutely not. Del Frisco's is, in my opinion, a prime example of a restaurant where their service makes up for their food.",

The hostess was superb when she saw we were a little bothered and she moved us instantly to a much better seat.  Took about 6 minutes to be offered drink choices(no biggie). We had a coupon for a free appetizer so we ordered onion rings. And our drinks right away. When she brought drinks we ordered meals.., ok first our salads come. Which the del salad is amazing. Then comes our meals. No appetizer ever comes so we ask about it and waitress apologized and brought it out at the end of our meals. And they comped us a desert ... The creme brulee is the best I have ever had in my life!!! So the service was not horrible. The steak however , I didn't eat and hubby only had a couple bites, I just would expect way more from a high end restaurant. My filet and my hubby's were both very fatty.",

Excellent wine list, including some marvelous vintages by the glass.   This is my very favorite Las Vegas restaurant.",

When it came time to pick a place for my birthday dinner, I said that I didn't really care where we went as long as I could get a good steak. Del Frisco's did not disappoint. We ordered the \"Power Couple\" Del Frisco's $99 three course menu for two (available until Labor Day). We also added a side of Lobster Macaroni & Cheese.I love lobster, and I love macaroni and cheese... How can you go wrong?! We were both pleased with our salads. Our steaks were absolutely perfect, and the Signature Crab Cake was a delicious mountain of crab. I would have liked a little more of the Cajun Lobster Sauce with my crab cake. The Chateau Potatoes were yummy. The Spinach Supreme was tasty, but it wasn't my favorite. Unfortunately, I was fairly underwhelmed by the Lobster Macaroni & Cheese... Too much to live up to maybe? We finished the meal with Bread Pudding and Chocolate Mousse. The bread pudding was dense and full of raisins and nuts, not really my taste.The chocolate mousse was fantastic. There was a little hidden layer of cake inside that I really enjoyed. They have also have a decent selection of wines by the glass and Scotch whisky.",

Also, we were told by the frumpy blonde manager we could not share and in fact if someone chose not to order an entree they would charge us for one anyway.  Sadly, several of us are small eaters and wanted to try lots of sides without a giant steak required.  Wholes experience was awful.  Would absolutely never go back and it seems to be just a cut above the outback.    Do not waste your time here.  Oh, did have a good vanilla lemon drop from the bar.  Place is so overrated.  Also, they refused to allow separate checks,etc.  The shrimp was tiny, way overcooked and smothered in cocktail sauce (from a jar).  For those of you who like this place give others a try like Mastro's or Ruth Chris or even Flemings...all beat this place by a mile.",

The restaurant consists of one main dining room with a bar and multiple side rooms to accommodate parties of any size. The night we were there, they had a jazz pianist that could of headlined anywhere - playing wonderfully in the background.  The staff and service were top notch.  We could not have had a better server in Tony. He was very personable and adequate in explaining the menu. The whole time we were there, he was always checking to see if everything was okay without being overbearing. After we finished our meal and engaging in friendly conversation, he offered to get us anything else (on his dime - this being our first visit to the restaurant). We declined but thanked him very much. What class!  As for the food, we started with the shrimp sampler and crabcake. Six jumbo shrimp with 3 different sauces - good. The crabcake was good size with practically all lump crab meat - excellent. I ordered the Carpetbagger which was a 10 oz ribeye served with potatoes - very good. My partner ordered the filet, also very good.  When they bring your steaks to the table, they ask that you cut into the meat to be sure it's the way you like it. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese - a little too al dente and dry for me.  I would definitely add Del Frisco's to the list of must returns when in Vegas.",

The entire staff works each table, not just the waiter/waitress.  Every dish was delicious.  Had the crabcakes for appetizer.  I do not like seafood at all but had to try.  It was delish...very flaky and light.  The steaks melt in your mouth and can just about be cut with a butter knife.  Meal was pricey but worth every penny. They back it up with excetional service and food.  Not once did we have to ask the waiter for anything...he anticipated our every need.  Will def visit again next time in Vegas.

Crab cakes were nearly perfect as an app, and the Turtle Soup was impressive as well. For steaks, well, I'd recommend jumping into the Double Eagle Steak if you can eat 26 oz of great steak.  Come to think of it, if you can't/don't want to eat that much steak, this probably isn't the right place for you. The food is top notch and it's a very elegant restaurant, but the portions are for the faint of heart.  It's a lot of food and the cost is a little bit too expensive for the food, but I was quite impressed anyway.  Also, the wine list was very, very extensive (over 1K bottles) from all price ranges",

Their simple dinner salad with the creamy house dressing is evened out with a few salty thick slices (note: not crumpled pieces) of bacon.  Their prime rib eye is so delicious b/c it just utterly moist and flavorful with that nice marbalized color on the outside.  Im not a filet mignon kind-of-guy, but their filet mignon was so tasty, tender and supprisingly moist that i think i will be ordering that even more.  The mashed potatoes are herby with a large dollop of artery clogging butter...but it was oh so damn good. It's not on the menu, but the macoroni and cheese is so good, not too salty from the chedder and it has some crunchy bits of something that gives the dish some other texture.   The desserts are OK, but I recommend the bread pudding with the jack daniels sauce...delicous.   The decor is all wood.  The service is wonderful.  There was a slight dispute between my party and some other patrons, but it was quickly resolved by management.  This restaurant does the best of its ability to retain the image of this restaurant.  They have an extensive wine list.  I really love going back to this place.",

SERVICE We took a cab from the Venetian over to the restaurant and got there about 10 minutes earlier than our reservation.  It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was not that busy.  I checked in with the host and we were told that we needed to wait til our reservation time...so we sat and waited 10 minutes until our reservation time and we were seated.  Noone left the restaurant in the time we were waiting.  During our meal, the server never checked on us, and when she did she had a very sarcastic almost put-off tone.  We did not order wine and she seemed to resent that for some reason.  When we passed on dessert as well, she said \"I thought you would say that.\".  She had a major attitude like we were there to serve her rather than her serving us.   We were in a private room with about 5 other tables and each of the other table had the manager or a host or someone checking on them during the meal.  Noone stopped by our table.    FOOD The menu looked fantastic and we ordered the chopped salad, a porterhouse, and a filet with shrimp & scallops.  The salad was fantastic.  The porterhouse was ordered medium-rare and the filet was ordered medium.  When the steaks came out, the filet was rare and the porterhouse was a nice medium-rare.  My date sent her filet back because it was a long way from medium.  They took my porterhouse back as well, but I told them to only keep it warm as it was cooked perfectly.  Well, 10 minutes later, they bring both steaks back and the filet was still only medium-rare and my steak had been over-done to a medium almost medium-well.  I had cut into my steak to check it before going back and when it came back, it was completely dried out.  The shrimp on my date's filet was absolutely rotten.  I have had good shrimp, bad shrimp, and spoiled shrimp...and the shrimp she got was definitely spoiled.  We ordered sides of macaroni & cheese and spinach--both highly recommended on the yelp board.  Even though, the meal was unenjoyable to that point, I was open to enjoying the sides...but they were beyond disappointing.  Flavorless, poorly seasoned, and not well exectued at all.  Cracker Barrel quality sides in my opinion.  One last comment on the steaks:  I like salt, but these steaks were so over-seasoned, it was almost hard to get down.  You could see the kosher salt crystals on the outside of the steak.  It was disturbing how over-salted the meat was.    I would not go back to Del Frisco's even if I were given a free meal.  There are a lot of nicer steakhouses in Vegas and I recommend Envy, N9ne, The Palm, or others.",

If I owned this place, I would rip out the carpet and the drop ceiling and replace them, such a nice place needs top air quality.  I will be back.

Dollar for dollar the best place to eat steaks for your saturday night bachelor party/large group meal in vegas.  You will spend nearly twice as much at Cut, Charlie Palmer's, or any of the other major name steakhouses on the strip and it won't be nearly as good.  Go here, end of story.  We sat at a round table in the main dining room but they can accomodate groups in private rooms.  I'm very pleased with the experience we had and would go there again next time I'm with a large group.",

Everything was so incredibly delicious, I've never came across a meal that is even close to how good this was. The service is also impeccable, it was my husbands birthday and they had a card on the table, each of the 5 or 6 waiters told him happy bday and they brought out a piece of the most delicious lemon cake on the house. Very expensive but worth every single penny. Love love love!",

    "text": "13 Guys and a bunch of meat what can get better than that right? This is the story of a bachelor party in Vegas on November 5th.   The crew arrived at the restaurant with plenty of time to spare. We were seated 10 min. after checking in with the Hostess. It gave us plenty of time to order up some shots at the bar and listen to the Jazz pianist classy it up.   We were seated @ a long table that accommodated all of us and the waiters gave us a detailed rundown about what is going on. Since the reservations was under my name the captain knew my name and addressed many of the options directly to me (nice touch for doing your homework).   For Apps we ordered a few of the following dishes: Crab cake, Calamari,  The crab cakes were good. I give it 4 stars for flavor because it came with a nice cream sauce. The crab meat was also large chunks and tasted very fresh. The value i give it 3 stars because it was only 1 average sized cake as opposed to the standard 2 cakes for $16.   The calamari was very good. I give it a 5 star for flavor. I really enjoyed the sweet and tangy sauce that came with it. The dish was really fresh and it was cooked very well.   For Entrees many of us ordered the 30oz bone in Wagyu to share between two people. The steak was a good split and it was an especially good value to be able to share wagyu. The flavor was spot on, it had a nice beefy flavor and the meat was tender and cooked very well.   For Sides we ordered: creamed corn, crab mac and cheese, garlic mash potatoes, and asparagus.  The notables are the crab mac and cheese the flavor was extremely tastey however it was a tad watery for my taste. The corn was delicious as well, it had bacon bits and some type of pepper which gave it a nice smokey flavor. The garlic mash was standard fair. The asparagus was only passable, it was blanched and topped with almonds,no creativity there.   The wine recommendation was very good however some in the group thought it was a bit too sweet to go with the steaks. I thought the blend was easy to drink, probably a little too much on the lighter side. However I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Overall a great trip. This is much better than many of the steakhouses on the strip. For a slight 4 min trip off the strip you will not be disappointed!",

The staff was enthusiastic, knowledgable, and very interactive. I took advantage of their special for the night, the bone-in filet. Cooked rare, warm and red in the center, perfect! For sides, we had lobster mac and cheese and sauteed mushrooms. Both were like phasers set on yum! After gorging on food fit for royalty, it was time for dessert. Split three ways, we had the lemon doberge cake and the creme brulee. The cake was the perfect consistency, and although some at my table thought that the cake could use more lemon flavor, I thought it was just the right amount of tang. Finally, I happened to order a Jack Rose, unfortunately, they didn't have the necessary ingredients. Much to my amazement, the bartender concocted his own drink which was similar, but just as tasty. All in all, Del Frisco's gets a WooHoo from me.",

    "text": "This steakhouse provides a very nice ambiance that is welcoming and unpretentious, which is not always the case at other high-end steakhouses in Vegas.   We sat at the bar while we waited for our table since we were early for our reservation. Both the house cocktail and the margarita were tasty.  To start, we tried the crab cake (everyone we spoke to recommended it). It was delicious. They bake their cakes instead of frying them and that made the cake nice and light. The sauce on the plate is delicious. They are not very big and each order only comes with one cake, so that is kind of a bummer when you are sharing with someone else.  I had their filet special which consisted of an 8oz filet mignon spilt and prepared in two different styles. The first had crab meat, asparagus, and hollandaise sauce on top. The second had a scallop wrapped in shrimp on top. Both were absolutely delicious. When they bring the steak out, they ask that you slice through the middle to make sure that it is prepared to your satisfaction.   For our sides, we got both the sauteed mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin. The au gratin was great, the mushrooms were just okay.  In terms of the service, our server was really nice and provided great recommendations, but there were a few stretches when we didn't see her. In her defense, however, she did have a large party, so I'm sure that they kept her occupied.  This place as more casual than Yelp lets on. I would say that as long as you wear a nice blouse/shirt and nice shoes you will be fine. It's more business casual than anything else.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have an excellent meal and am looking forward to my next visit.",

As long as you can get someone else to pay, I think this place is better than most of the other steakhouse chains I've been to (although Capital Grille still holds the gold medal in my book).    After overeating for the majority of my trip, I decided on the double filet mignon with lobster and scallops.  It was the perfect size and wonderfully cooked.  Sides were fantastic too -- lobster mac & cheese and potatoes au gratin were standouts.  Crab cake was also heavenly.  The only thing that slightly disappointed was the shrimp appetizer with three sauces... seemed a little too bland for my taste.   The service was amazing.  We were with a group of eight and we ordered sides for the table.  In most steakhouses they plop down the sides, but in Del Frisco they actually brought in three servers at once who SPOONED out the sides to everybody.  Made things a lot less awkward at the table!  Finally, we capped off the night with a visit to the James Bond table.  Definitely one of the best meals I've had to date.",

When they brought out the steak, they ask you cut it to make sure it is cooked to your liking. The steak is pretty good. I for one am not a big fan of filet mignon but this one was good. I am definitely a fan of this place now.",

My husband is a big fan of Mastro's, but I liked Del Frisco's meat better, it just tasted better imo, and was memorable. Del Frisco's crab cakes were sweet and juicy and meaty, with just the right amount of filler (almost none lol), even better than some crab cakes I've had in Maryland (I'm originally from the east coast). Banana bread pudding was also better than I thought it would be! So yummy! I don't really remember the side dishes though.  The entire staff went out of their way to be friendly and attentive. We were on our honeymoon and the staff hand signed a card for us and everyone that passed our table gave cheerful congratulations. It was fun.  The only minor complaint is that I wish the music wasn't so loud, or maybe classier or jazzier. I also wasn't a fan of the pineapple infused cocktail, it wasn't sweet enough and too strong for me! Ha ha, light weight.",

SW, Botero, Switch, Cut, Del Monicos, Prime Steak house, craft steak, the mansion, and even paiza club, and others. But this is until i find another one this steak house is the best.   What we had: 3x Bone-in Filet Mignon 1x Gumbo 1x Seafood Soup 1x Seafood Cocktail 1x Asparagus 1x Lobster Mac & Cheese  The steak was flavorful almost too flavorful and seasoned, juicy and succulent. My  mouth is watering writing about this. They do it just right while they cook the meat, it's hot through out but red and not over cooked. Do you know how hard it is to cook a nice rare piece of beef?   Mac and cheese hmmm cheesy with lobster and small shells.  Asparagus - steamed Shrimp Cocktail - big fresh pieces of shrimp.  and the soup was just ok.  We ordered a bottle of wine called Mica by Buccela one of the up and coming wineries that most have yet to hear about it. Great Cab blend.   All in all my dining experience was a 5.5 out of 5. I mean it was phenomenal.   I will be back for more next time i'm in Vegas. Always a stop for me...",

Del Frisco's staff was not only easy to communicate with regarding he reservations and details, but they were always 1 step ahead of what we needed. Amazing customer service by their wonderful staff, very great and entertaining people they have there, everyone was just so friendly! They're steaks were perfectly cooked, and for 18 people, everything came out fast, in past experience, the larger the party, the slower the service. Not in the case of Del Frisco's! If you're in Las Vegas, definitely give this place a shot. A wonderful way to end our last evening in Vegas. Thank you Del Frisco's. We will be back!",

We've tried several of them, but we always come back to Del Friscos. This is our third visit to the Las Vegas location, and once again we were impressed with the service and the food.  Service at Del Friscos is always amazing. We received our salad and entrees perfectly prepared and with panache. Who knew that spooning potatoes onto my plate could actually be an art form? My husband and I shared the Porterhouse, medium rare. It was deftly sliced into shareable pieces and placed on perfectly buttered and heated plates. The sides, potatoes and asparagus, were portioned on to our plates alongside the juicy steak. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the utmost attention was given to all diners in the restaurant.   I'm ridiculously happy that a Del Friscos has finally opened in Boston. This could get dangerous.....",

I dont usually eat at high end steakhouses because I can cook a steak at home.  We were out for a night on the town so why not splurge a little.  I think our server was not as experienced as the others.  I heard other servers articulating the menu as well as mentioning things that were not on the menu.  Ours did not do that.  The place smelled like sewage in the main area.  Luckily our section was fine.  The air conditioning was awfully cold.  We spent just under $200 once tip was added for my wife and I.  And that was without drinks. The good- 32 oz was cooked and seasoned just the way I like it.  Its nice having a steak being served on an extremely hot plate.  Mashed sweet potato were really tasty.  And the asparagus was perfectly cooked and still crunchy.  The chocolate mousse was not overly rich tasty like many other places.",

    "text": "We have been going to this place for years. It has become an excuse for a 4 hour drive to Vegas. Everything about Del Frisco's from the service to the wine list to the food...hmmm the food...is absolutely top notch.   Considering other places that offer this level of quality the prices are actually quite reasonable. With appetizer and dessert (no alcohol) my wife and I usually spend $150 (including tip).   The key things on the menu that you should not miss are:   Crab Cake - Large and very dense. these are not the crab cakes you find at most restaurant that are fried, these are mountains of crab surrounded by a delicious spicy sauce (i would call it medium). 2 people could share one easily.   Rib Eye - All the steaks on the menu I'm sure are delicious, but our our order is always the rib eye. We usually order the carpet bagger (10 oz steak with Mash Potatoes) or you can order the steak alone that come in 16 oz + sizes.   Mash Potatoes - These are a dream. buttery with a kick of onion. They bring it to the table with fresh butter on top to make it extra creamy. The carpet bagger has enough for one, other wise the family style sides can all serve 3-4 people.   Asparagus - If you are a fan of veggies you will love these. They are cooked medium, so they are tasty but still have a crunch.   Mushrooms - They go great with a steak. The mushrooms are whole sauteed in butter with plenty of black pepper.   Finally, last but in no way least...dessert. Warm Chocolate Cake.....hmmmm. This used to be served in a pastry shell which was tasty, but hard eat. The new version is served warm with scoop of vanilla ice cream. The ice cream is good, but the cake is center stage. It has a melting center that is pure chocolate goodness and the cake itself has the texture of a fudge brownie that just melts in your mouth. Really...don't pass this up. It's the reason we only order the 10 oz steak.   Bon Appetit!",

Our waitress had a lot on her hands when she had our table of 13 to handle. She did a fine job, kept it professional, and answered all of our questions to her best knowledge. Our waters never went below half way down the glass. It was refilled everytime someone took a huge gulp.   As for the food, I had one of the best filet mignons ever in my life. I got the smallest cut too (8 oz.) but it was thick enough that I was still not able to finish it. There's no word to explain the flavoring, it was that good. The texture of the meat was perfect. I'm getting hungry just thinking about that meal. I'm so excited for it that I skipped describing my appetizer first, which was shrimps served with 3 seperate sauces and crab cakes. Amazing is all I can say.   The dinner roll was also very good. It was fresh and seemed like it just came out of the oven. As for sides, the mac n' cheese is a must order as well as the cream corn. The potatoes au gratin didn't live up to the hype. The way they serve the sides is family style. We first received our main entree'. It was immediately followed by a an army of servers. I swear, there were about 6 of them surrounding us. Each had a side dish in their hand. They came around and asked if we'd like that specific side and if yes, then they would scoop it on plate and move on.  In the end, we had no room for dessert. Everyone in my party seemed very pleased with Del Frisco's. It wasn't the most inexpensive meal but it was sure worth it. I would highly recommend this place for steak lovers. If you have a big party, it's probably best to make reservations because this restaurant got pretty occupied.",

The lobster mac & cheese was awesome... wasn't overly cheesy like kraft mac and cheese and the lobster was abundant and not overcooked.  I ordered the Double Eagle, a 22oz  steak.  It was cooked exactly what a Medium should be.  There was just enough fat to make it tasty and not overly fatty.  It was a good cut and full of flavor.  My knife was cutting it w/o any effort as it was like butter.  The wine we had ordered was the perfect pair with the steak.  I have been to a lot of steakhouses (flemmings, morton's, maestro's) but I'd have to say this place was one (if not) the best steakhouse I have ever been to.  It was a great way to celebrate my buddy's end of bachelorhood!",

Arrived at 7:00 seated at 7:45.  During the wait we sat at the bar which was very busy. The bartender Ron was very quick to take our order and bring our first drinks and did a great job to check on us for addition drinks. We decided to order appetizers while we were waiting.  Just after ordering we were seated and Ron had the order transferred to the table.  The waiter came to take our drink orders, we all had full drinks as they we brought them from the bar, order appetizers, we had those in already so we ordered or main meals at 7:45.  Soon the appetizers arrived but only half of what was ordered. We had to follow up with the waiter about the missing items which came 15mins later.  Dinners took too long, we enquired and were told we were the next ticket.  30 mins later we asked again,  the manager came by and apologized for the wait and that they would comp the appetizers, which was a nice touch.  Dinner arrived at 9:20. That's just not acceptable in anyway especially when one of the $50 steaks arrives cold. It was sent back. Again the manager apologized and had a new steak done quickly and took it off the bill. The steaks were good. The green beans blanched at best and the asparagus extremely undercooked.  We ended the night with a $549 bill despite all the credits and did not wish to invest further time for coffee and dessert.    Nice place, friendly staff, great bar staff, stylish and clean, big issues in the kitchen.  Very disappointed with this visit and we were there with a prospect hoping to earn their business. I hope they don't make their decision to do business with me based on my choice of a restaurant.",

The lobster bisque was cold as well as the room because Jackie the  waitress, was feeling menopausal And lowered the temperature without checking with the rest of the guests. We were a party of 17.   Main meal: The 8 ounce filet was cooked excellent however the Oscar on top was cold. The scallops were bitter and had an unusual tangy taste. The baked potato was not freshly cooked it was obviously pre-cooked and warmed resulting in a disappointing baked potato. The cream spinach and corn were delicious but the brussels sprouts were old, mature and bitter. Desert: The butter cake was phenomenal. Two of our guests were celebrating birthdays and Del Frisco served  a medley of three desserts. Lava cake, the butter cake with pecan ice cream and fresh strawberries Thelemon Cake was somewhat tasteless it would've been improved with lemon zest. Overall for party of 17 and roughly $150 a person the experience as a whole was a disappointment. Other than asking how the steak was cooked we were not asked how our meals were meeting our satisfaction. At this price point the service was poor.",

Not only did they treat us right, their food was top notch as well.  I ordered the 32. oz Wagyu Tomahawk Ribeye.  By far the best steak I've had in my life.  And I've been to many top level steakhouses around Vegas, including Carne Vino, Delmonico's, Vic and Anthony's, etc.  Although the price for this particular steak was $89, it tasted like a steak worth well north of $100.  I also got it with Bone Marrow Butter ($6) on the side which complimented and enhanced the flavors even further.  The sides we ordered, Lobster Mac n Cheese and Potatoes Au Gratin were excellent as well.    It's not often that a dinner night out totally blows my socks off......",

The host gave us a signed card saying Happy Anniversary and I thought it was the cutest touch. The food was delicious, I'm not a fan of lobster and they were more than happy to make me some mac n cheese without it. I still dream about going back just for that. Service was fantastic, at one point while our server assistant was filling a water glass his pants ripped along the wall. As he tried to maintain his 5-star composure we thought it was a great laugh. It was a really nice upscale yet casual dinner, we had a great time and truly can't wait to go back!",

The happy hour food specials were fairly prices and the speciality martini was great. The martini was infused pineapple vodka, very similar to the knockout martini at Sullivan's.   The food was pretty good. Cheese steak egg rolls were a little to greasy for me.  Overall, if I was in the area I could easily be a regular here. The bar filled very fast and we arrived right after HH started.",

Three happy hour visits in and the food, service and entertainment have always been consistently on point. You will enjoy listening to Jerome, who plays a mean piano and sings with a smooth vocal range. He can belt out R&B, jazz, soul, and classic pop favorites!   I have not had a full steak dinner here yet, but the items that I have tasted tells me that their steaks will not disappoint!! I highly recommend the crab cakes for an appetizer. You can tell the crab is fresh and does not come from a can. The bruschetta or the meat n cheese egg rolls are mighty tasty.  The buffalo style shrimp is good too. Also, their steak salad is delicious. Great amount of steak ratio to green mixed lettuce. Even their house bread is great. Always served warm with a side of whipped butter! Save room for dessert. The lemon cake will not disappoint or the creme brulee. Fantastic coffee as well!!   Del Frisco is an excellent choice whether you come in for dinner, drinks or seeking to entertain business clients. Your out-of-town guests will get a kick out of the James Bond 007 wine collection table. Great photo opportunities, as the table rises up and opens up to the one-of-a-kind wine bottles. Also, if you sit at the bar, you will enjoy Ron the bartender. Funny, witty and smart conversationalist who knows how make a well made drink!!",

We all shared the 32oz Wagyu Ribeye which was cooked perfectly as asked (medium-rare). It was extremely flavorful, but sadly American wagyu and not Kobe wagyu, so it didn't \"melt\" in my mouth as I was expecting it to. With the Uptown Potatoes and the Lobster Mac & Cheese (could be the best tasting lobster Mac & Cheese in the known universe) there were sides leftover. Our server and the somnelier were outstanding. Cocktails were strong and well made. Since one of our group was there for his 50th, they comped our table a dessert platter consisting of their  Lava Cake (good), Ice Cream (better) and Butter Cake (best).  Awesome experience! Go!!!",

The server we had gave our table tons of attention, and we ended up striking up friendly conversation about living in Las Vegas. Two different managers checked on our tables insuring the most excellent experience. Food was off the charts in quality: the lobster bisque was the best I have had along with the 45 day aged ribeye. Dessert was also amazing I could not stop eating the mousse, excellent recommendation by the server. Overall I had an A+++++ experience the staff really outdid themselves from the valet, the hostesses, the managers, servers, bussers, and of coarse the chefs who delivered a perfectly prepared meal!",

It was a memorable meal that left me full and satisfied.  We were seated immediately when we arrived a few minutes early for our 7 PM reservation. William greeted us at our table, which was isolated toward the back and gave the wife and I some quality one on one time. William gave a fine introduction of himself, the restaurant, and the menu. His service was flawless throughout the meal, from his excellent recommendations to the perfect timing of the courses. He was a step ahead of everything and addressed concerns before we even had to ask.  I had a great start with the VIP which is vodka infused with pineapple. The west coast oysters and steak tatare were our appetizers followed with the 16 oz. bone in filet and shrimp scampi as entrees. I was completely ready to order the Prime Pair, but with William using catch phrases such as: \"dry aged then wet aged,\" \"two cuts per cow,\" and \"melting bone marrow,\" I couldn't resist. The steak lived up to everything he described, cooked perfectly and I cut the steak into the smallest bites to savor every melt in your mouth ounce. The creamed spinach and mushrooms were excellent sides to our meal. For the wine drinkers, on the second to last page of the wine list they have a list of half bottles of wine if one glass is not enough for you and a full bottle may be too much. I had a half bottle of the Fedilitas Merlot.  The perfect finish to the meal was the lemon cake which my wife and I polished off, or more like me polishing it off with my wife having a bite or two. I'm happy we finally made it to Del Frisco's and can't wait for the next trip.",

This is supposed to be a site of reviewers with an edge.. cool people with great taste. A site that stands apart with reviews you can trust.... But I guess I will only be able to trust professional reviewers from now on. And Yelp will just be a barometer but not the final word. Here's my review on Del Frisco's: The wedge was good, not great. My tuna was good. It all goes downhill from here. We ordered my husband's ribeye medium and asked if it was a True medium or more medium well. They said it will have pink all the way through... that it was a True medium. The thing came out with hardly any pink at all. Totally overcooked. Even being medium well, he should have liked it. He ate a few bites and pushed it aside. Flavorless. It must have really been bad because he usually loves ribeye.  And he was hungry. This would never happen at Ruth's Chris. The steak would be gone!  We ordered the Potatoes Au Gratin and they came with bacon, something I had just informed the waitress I don't eat when attempting to order another side.  My husband said it was near raw, anyway.  She whisked them away and brought us onion rings. They looked great!  But... they were undercooked and the batter had zero flavor. It's sad when the Awesome Blossom at Outback (I've had to go when in small towns!) is a hundred times better. Del Frisco's thinks they know meat but they don't. Sides are INCREDIBLY mediocre. So fellow yelpers, were you just so swept away by this \"real fancy\" restaurant that you convinced yourself the meat here was good? Or maybe it's your first time at an \"upscale\" steakhouse? I noticed the 5 star reviews are mainly from out of towners. Hardly any locals who know better. I have lost confidence in some of you but I will continue to write because I want to help others avoid making the same mistake we made. Don't let Del Frisco's happen to you.",

    "text": "Best part of going back to Vegas for another Bachelor Party? Another steakhouse dinner! Del Frisco's is absolutely a must visit. Since it was our first visit, they recommended starting out with seafood appetizers. The Crab Cakes, Shrimp Cocktail, Shrimp Remoulade, and Marinated Shrimp were totally fresh and delicious. For myself, I decided on a 8oz Filet Mignon- excellent and juicy red! The service overall is top notch like their dishes- with no upselling either- and are much friendlier to large parties than some places.",

I tried you for your happy hour, with advance notice of a reputation for good stiff cocktails and well executed small bites/bar food, but it just was not to be.  Sure, your happy hour burger was a good deal and well prepared, and I would expect nothing less from a high-end steakhouse (see Flemings).  However, drinks were underwhelming (particularly mixed drinks and special concoctions) and food on the bar menu was poorly conceived and prepared - see BBQ shrimp which was nothing like any BBQ shrimp I  have ever had, and so oily and excessively over-spiced (to the point that all one can taste is excessive heat on a delicate ingredient such as shrimp) that it threatened to both burn my mouth and linger for hours with uncontrolled and irresponsible use of heat, and run right through me.  Bartending staff was inconsistent as well - a few good actors, but some inattentive and cold players as well.",

Seriously, all 8 people said The Double Eagle. I had the prime rib medium rare with the baked potato and a lettuce wedge. Normally when I go to a nice place like this with clearly featured entrees, I want to try their fastball. The prime rib was perfectly cooked and well seasoned on the outside. The potato was also very good. I could tell it hadn't been cooked hours before and left in a warmer, the outside was seasoned with thick Kosher salt. The lettuce wedge was a very cold iceberg quarter with huge blue cheese and bacon bits. I Love food that is straight forward and spot on. This was a meal you would think you could prepare at home but if you tried, you would come up lacking.  Our server was very helpful and received a well earned 30% tip on like a 700.00 check.   ***Note: As a rule of thumb, at a new restaurant, I follow my nose. I could smell the coal grill in the kitchen from the second I came in and in a very good way.",

David definitely helped make the evening very special & exceeded my husband's high expectations about how we should be treated at a nice restaurant.  Even better - the food also exceeded our expectations - 4 had the filet & 2 had the mahi mahi.  My husband really likes chocolate lava cake, while they did not have this on the menu, David talked with the chef & came up with a similar option that was wonderful.  After our meal, the chef came out to greet us & ask how everything was - our response was awesome!  The special evening did not end there.  David arranged for us to have pictures taken in their phenomenal wine cellar along with a tour.  It was definitely a special evening...we will return the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2018 menu ***  The RW menu had some upgrades on it.  I ordered Lobster bisque for a starter.  For the main course, I got the 8 ounce filet mignon that came with chateau potatoes and I paid $6 for an upgrade to wild mushroom Bordelaise sauce.  I finished the meal with strawberry cheesecake.  After ordering an iced tea, I put my order in with my server, Dane.  Since I ordered the filet blue, he said he'd make sure it was courses correctly and wait until I finished my soup before they did the steak.  The lobster bisque had very rich broth and was brimming with lobster pieces and some good sized chunks.  One of the best lobster bisques I've had.  The steak was done correctly and was covered with the very tasty wild mushroom Bordelaise suace.  Thew chateau potatoes were mashed with parsley and some seasonings.  A nice accompaniment to a very tender piece of beef--almost fork tender.  I went with the cheesecake for dessert since I've had a number of chocolate desserts recently and I wanted something different.  It was standard cheesecake with strawberry sauce and some fresh strawberry pieces.    Service was excellent.  Another time, I'd take the option of sitting in the \"back room\" because the bar was slammed with people enjoying Happy Hour and it was a bit noisy in that section.  50% off all bar bites and drinks certainly brings them in.  I had been told by a friend to make sure I checked out the James Bond table.  It's a large round table on the way to the back room.  If you ask to see, the host will press a button and the top of the table rises and opens up in wedges and bright lights come on.  It consists of 18 custom wine bottles ranging for James Bond movies ranging from Dr. No to Tomorrow Never Dies.  It's worth a look.  This is worth a repeat visit!",

My birthday dinner was by far the most disappointing dinner at Del Frisco's by far.  I understand that menus change over time, but I look forward to the lamb chops every time I come. They were the best lamb chops in town. They are no longer on the menu and have been replaced with a 'Dry Aged Prime Lamb' that is cut off the bone for you. I asked our waiter about it and he went on and on about how wonderful it was. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good, not great, just pretty good, but the Chops were always AMAZING.   My husband ordered the 'Prime Steak(16 oz)' and it had to be sent back because it was way over cooked. That meant my lamb had to be taken to be kept warm. The mushroom and onion side was good, but not quite a mushroom that you want on top of a steak. We did really like the Del's Potato.  Our drinks were great as always though. Like I said, we have come here many times and I look forward to celebrating special occasions here, as I save all the cards that the employees sign. When we get home, I put the date on them and put them away. This year there was no card, no nothing.  Sorry Del Frisco's, you dropped the ball this time and we will be shopping around for a new favorite upscale restaurant to go to where we feel valued as a patron.",

The lobster bisque is delicious, fresh bread is yummy and the tips fabulous. Really happy they're bringing back Tyrone and his live music on Fri and Sat.   One of the best dining experiences in Las Vegas for locals, Convention goers and those celebrating a special occasion.",

    "text": "Absolutely amazing experience here on this past Friday night. Though it was the last night of restaurant week, I was able to schedule a table for a party of eight to celebrate a friend's bachelor party a couple of days before after cancelling a reservation at another steakhouse.  Service was great, our waitress was attentive and super friendly. The maitre d' came by about half way through our meal and was an incredible host as well.  The steaks were perfectly cooked-- my 12 oz filet mignon with truffle butter and king crab meat was one of the best cuts I've eaten in my life. Wine glasses weren't too overpriced-- $20 for a glass of Duckhorn Merlot seemed very fair to me as well.  Also, thank you to the staff for being able to speed up dessert and process checks separately for us when we were running late to our show!",

    "text": "This pretty much is it. I came here on the recommendation from a friend and really enjoyed it. I would say that one of the keys to its success is its approach to people and hospitality. Not many places strive for a good customer experience that is proactive.   I got the 12 ounce filet cooked medium rare and it was served perfectly. (I would say, they do ask you to cut into the middle of the steak to see if it's cooked to your liking. I really don't like this approach since it releases the juices from the inside of the steak and it also allows the steak to cool faster.) I did like the seasoning on the steak, it was a good course salt and pepper. I do feel like it could have benefited from some garlic. I normally don't like butter with my steaks since I believe it makes the steak less tender but they do offer many butter toppings.   All the sides are family style. We got the scalloped potatoes and Mac and cheese. Both were very good, however, I haven't noticed many places that give you little wedges for the potatoes in scalloped potatoes. Either way, it was really good and went well with the steak.   Of course you have to have Cabernet for the wine pairing.   All around it was good, I recommend coming here. I'd like to come back again.",

We had a room reserved in the wine cellar area.  It was ready on time, private and very well presented. The service was a 10/10.  Our server was knowledgeable and pleasant, and skillfully navigated our group of somewhat \"unruly\" gents.  The sommelier was also very skilled and we ended up with great wine.  I didn't order one, but the cocktails were also a hit.  The food was very good to excellent.  Bacon appetizer was awesome.  Not the absolute best bone-in ribeye I ever had, it was but up there on the list.  Cooked perfectly.  Great sides.  No up-selling and everything was polished off in short order.  I recommend this steakhouse if you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday a few months ago and absolutely loved it.  This place has managed to be a chain but still have a unique draw to it that makes it feel like an old time classic. From the moment you walk in and see the decor and feel the ambiance it's almost like a pice of old time vegas.   We had reservations for 8:00 and they were running about 10 minutes behind so we ordered a couple drinks at the bar. We were greeted bar a very friendly and knowledgeable bartender. Ordered an extra dirty grey goose martini and a cable car. Both were made pretty perfectly. The bartender was very skilled and knowledgeable and we loved the feel at the bar.  We were escorted to our seats and greeted by our server. Once again everyone was very professional warm and inviting.  After looking at the menu we went ahead and started off with the bacon salad and the beef carpaccio.  If you're a fan of bacon then the salad is for you. 2 crispy smoky full slices of bacon. Not the crumbled underworked pieces you'd find in some chains where you can't tell if it's even really bacon.  The carpaccio was also pretty amazing.topped off with fresh greens, capers and I believed a Dijon sauce, it's served with toasted bread chips. The beef was tender and sliced paper thin. The flavors truly did come together creating a flavor explosion in your mouth of a magnitude 10.0 on the tasty scale.  Moved on the the 32 oz wagu tomahawk steak. It's served on the bone to provide that extra tasty flavor and give you a feel of the caveman days. It was sliced table side and served between 2 of us. It was slightly undercooked from the medium rare we ordered but wow was it delicious. The meat was tender and buttery. Seemed to simply melt in your mouth!  Last was a complimentary dessert that offered their butter cake. It was the perfect end to a  marvelous dinner.",

BUT - you can't get the delicious lobster mac n cheese nor the prime cuts like a rib eye.  Their wines range from affordable $$ to the couple thousand. Could be higher, i stopped flipping pages after that...  Order a bottle of red, splurge on the tomahawk, a side of the mac and a side of asparagus. The 32 oz tomahawk is enough to share between two. The crust is excellent and it was cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  The butter cake is a popular choice. Can't go wrong with butter pecan ice cream and a cake named after butter. For something more classic, the chocolate souffle cake rivals Roy Yamaguchi's signature dessert.  Less than 10 minutes off the strip.",

We all ordered different veggies, and we had various wines open around the table.  The steaks were all cooked absolutely perfectly.  The veggies were awesome (so the group says...I stuck with a perfect baked potato with all the trimmings).    The wait stuff were absolutely stellar - almost, but not quite, to the hovering effect.  Wines stayed full, dishes were cleared immediately, and all of this without disrupting conversation.  Overall, probably one of the top three steak experiences I've had in Vegas.  Recommended.",

Ordered the following:  - Crab cake, this dish is a must have unless you are allergic to crab. Most crab cakes have quite of bit of breading which I do not like. Del Frisco's version has hardly at all, 95% is all CRAB!!!!! It was very tasty. Too bad it was quite pricey ($19) but you get what you paid for. I would definitely ordered it again.  - Ribeye (16oz), tasty. No complaints.  - Bone-in ribeye (22oz), tasty. No complaints.  - Double Eagle Bone-in Strip (26oz), I normally order ribeye but I do like to try the restaurant's 'signature' steak. I was surprised that it was good. I am always afraid that a thick steak will not be cooked to my liking. I was glad I tried it but I miss the flavor and texture of ribeye.   - Lobster mac & cheese, I was disappointed. Hardly any lobster. It might as well be called mac & cheese.  - Asparagus, decent. No complaints.  Service was great. Everyone was attentive and our waitress was knowledgeable and answered all my questions.  Ambiance was nice.  I do wish it was a bit brighter. The lights was dimmed for a 'romantic' setting.  My friends thanked me for dining here. They all said the steaks were much better than Gallaghers. We will be back!!!!  One of the managers told us that they are looking to open a location in Southern California. I plan to make a reservation on opening night!!!!",

Our waiter introduced the specials including each dish's price, which our last server neglected to do. Our server also warned us that they tend to undercook their steaks and made recommendations how our steaks should be prepared. We took his advice and went with medium for their double eagle bone in steak and that did not disappoint! When our food came, they were all served on hot plates and since I was sharing my steak, they brought out an extra hot plate for me. I hadn't noticed the hot plate during my first visit so this may be new. I was very delighted that this kept my food hot for a while, just the way I like it.

I had a smaller meal, from their oddly-named langiappe section, and my god, the pepper. The steak was heavily peppered, the potatoes were peppery, the sauce was peppercorn. All I could taste for a good hour or two after eating was pepper.   I complained to the server, Ben or Benny, who said \"well I wished you'd have said something earlier\" -- not a great response when you're paying $40 for a plate of, well, pepper.   The sides, too, were disappointing. The lobster mac and cheese was watery, lacking in both flavour and lobster. The potatoes au gratin were underdone, and the cheese appeared to be that american \"cheese\" you try to avoid if you like actual cheese. The \"bone marrow\" butter tasted like butter.   And the bill was around $70 a head with a glass of wine and service. The server told us he couldn't split the bill, so we got to work it out ourselves. Thanks I guess?   One to miss.",

Friend drove us and accidently made a wrong turn and somehow ended up in Bally's parking lot.  It seemed like we were driving around in circles.  Arrived and was asked to wait for our table.  Approached the bar and ordered a round of drinks.  Finally was seated and started ordering.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and we all shared a few sides.  They brought over 2 baskets of warm bread which was devoured in a matter of minutes as we were all starving.  Waiters brought the steaks and we were asked to cut a slice of your steak just to make sure it was cooked correctly.  Mine was cooked perfectly and everyone else's was as well.  Sides were all good and were served by the waiters.    Didn't have any of their desserts as we all were stuffed.  Waiter asked that we provide either a business card or our address.  What's cool is that they personally write a letter to you thanking you for the patronage.  Definitely a nice touch.  Second visit was just recently where I took a few coworkers for a nice dinner.  Of course it was during the Western conference semi-finals.  We were lucky to get a table facing the bar where we could watch the game.  Two of us had money on the line so it was perfect.  This time around ordered just the normal ribeye.  Again it was cooked perfectly.  We ordered a special side for the night (forget what it was) along with the skillet potatotes.  The special side was tasty but the skillet potatoes was a tad on the salty side.  Again we were all too full for dessert and just asked for the bill.  Waitress again asked for our contact information and a few weeks later, a nice letter arrived in the mail.  Definitely a solid steakhouse in the Las Vegas area which is only a few minutes away from the strip.",

    "text": "Del Frisco's is a great example of a classic steakhouse.  It's got a huge mahogany (or appears to be mahogany anyway) bar, classic menu items, and excellent service.  We have been to this particular location many times, and I've also eaten at one in Dallas.  This Del Frisco's may have the best crabcakes I've eaten.  Just fantastic, and it's hard to call anything a \"value\" at a place this pricey, but you certainly get a lot of crab meat for the price.  My wife has had the blue cheese wedge salad which is a hit.  It's large, and the blue cheese is of excellent quality.  Very veiny and flavorful.  I typically get the bone in ribeye when it's available at any steakhouse.  It's usually one of the largest cuts on the menu, and is very flavorful.  Del Frisco's offering is no different.  We have had probably a half dozen of the sides, but the onion rings and lobster mac n cheese stand out.  The wine list can be high, but there are bottles on the list that can give you a great pairing to your steak.    As noted above, the service never lacks.  Water glasses rarely get half way empty, much less all the way empty.  And, it's a nice relaxed meal, they aren't rushing you.  There are a bunch of great steakhouses in Vegas, and this location of Del Frisco's can hold it's own with the vast majority of them.  Recommended.",

The star is for their tender and juicy Prime ribeye ($49). It's one of best steakhouse in Vegas. However, the service and their seafood are unacceptable. We ordered shrimp cocktail and shell oyster for our appetizers. The shrimp looks huge , but taste really hard. We talked to the server the shrimp seems overcooked. He didn't say anything at all then walked away! This is my first time having oyster but no water in each shell! I can tell the oyster wasn't fresh.  We spent about $110 per person.",

    "text": "BEYOND THE STEAK  (cause it was perfect and doesn't need changing)  Del Friscos needs to update themselves. What once was probably a well planned interior with appropriate decorating at the time now just seems dated. Now, from a business perspective, that's okay if you want to retain your regular customers and keep them happy, but not okay if want to attract younger new customers.   On a recent visit there, I felt as if I should have been with my parents.  They would love the quiet side rooms and comfort of the dark interiors.  As for the menu, it's not that the food was bad, but it just didn't inspire any excitement in me to choose one item over the other versus what some of the newer high end steak houses do.   32oz Dry Aged Sirloin $90 was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the Mac & Cheese with Lobster $16 was just alright, Caesar Salads (2@ $10 ea.) were not bad, but disappointing because it was just average. The bread and butter was above average.   For drinks, we had the Blackberry Ginger Martini $14, Champagne  Cocktails (2@ $14 ea.) and Woodford Reserve $13.50.",

The service here is impeccable, and if you fill out the card at the end they will send you a personalized thank you note.  Now on to the meat and wine list.  The wine list here is very nice and very well stocked.  Almost all the servers are very knowledgeable, and I'm pretty sure that there is at least one sommelier on staff.  I usually get the bone in Ribeye, which I really like, it's flavorful and so far has not been overly fatty.  I have also had their Wagyu beef tomahawk chop, which was also superb.  I like that they tell you what each done-ness means, as each steakhouse seems to do it slightly differently.  I will continue to frequent this place until I find a better steakhouse in Vegas that can compete on price.  It should also be mentioned that you can get away with dinner under $60 per person if you want to be a bit thrifty.",

I decided that I would order appetizers for the table so Jumbo shrimp cocktail and crab cakes for all. Also, i ordered 3 huge lobster tails for everyone to share. The waiter was completely on the ball with everything from the Appetizers, sides, wine and the bill.  Jumbo shrimp cocktail with 3 sauces: everyone received 3 jumbo shrimps covered with 3  sauces. Excellent all around, especially the garlic style scampi sauce.  Crab cakes: Best I ever had. Jumbo lump crab meat with minimum filler. Cooked perfectly.  Main coarse: Bone in rib-eye. (picture posted) Cooked perfect. sides were:  asparagus: excellent scalloped style potatoes: excellent mac-n-cheese: average/fair  desert: Lemon cake: super dense and flavorful. The only downside is there is a huge shortening after taste with the cake. Double espresso: sucked. should have ordered regular coffee.  Service: excellent. At one time we had 8 servers at our table, each with 2 plates in hand to serve the main dish. No questions asked. They knew who had what cut of meat.  pros: Great beef great appetizers great sides excellent service (waiter was Troy and he was awesome)  cons: overpriced wine list bad espresso (do not order)  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves beef. It was one of my top 3 steaks ever eaten.",

Many of the top chefs and restaurants reside on the strip. However Del Frisco's is just as good. It is worth the drive off the strip to eat here.  Service: We always have reservations when we eat here. Reservations do not seem too difficult to get. We normally come with about 8-12 people and we are seated immediately. The staff is always very helpful when going through the menu. They are extremely attentive. They go the extra mile to make sure every minor detail is covered. One time our waiter overheard us planning our night and he offered to try to get us on the list to XS! They consistently strive to provide customer satisfaction.  Food: The food is great! I have had both the Porterhouse Steak and the Bone In Ribeye. Both were excellent and cooked to perfection. My preference is to eat the Ribeye. It is perfectly marbled and juicy. Sides are served family style and are all very good. I especially like the lobster mac and cheese.   Del Friso's has great food and awesome service. I recommend this place if you are in Vegas. Its a great place to go out with friends, while getting away from the crazy busy Las Vegas Strip. They offer great food without the hassles that come with eating at some of the places on the strip.",

Special of the day filet mignon trio - Three 4 ounce steaks, one with brie, one with truffled cream sauce and topped with asparagus and crab, and the last surf and turf style with a scallop and shrimp.

We also tried the stone crab claws which was okay. Nothing so special about those.   Make sure to order the pineapple vodka. It is very DELICIOUS.  One advice...  We had a party of 10 and we ordered less sides than recommended and it worked out perfect-no left overs. We were stuffed!!! The sides are pretty big, I would say almost equivalent to Mastro's.

Our waitress showed us the \"James Bond\" table at our request - a tip we got from Yelp.  We were served delicious bread, were told the specials, had all our questions answered and were impressed by the menu. The rib eye was flavorful and very tender, the beef medallions were also tasty and my lamb chops were perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  Our sides were delicious: asparagus, mushrooms, potatoes au gratin and cheddar mashed potatoes.   Cocktails were tasty, and the wine selection was like heaven.  Dessert was fantastic.

I decided to skip the appetizers and go right for the prime bone in porterhouse steak. It was well cooked, buttered right, and tasted amazing. I had it medium rare so it was a dark purple/pink on the inside.The sides I went with were the mashed potatoes which were too spicy and was overdosed with pepper. The asparagus was good but I've had better. This is a great steakhouse and one of the best I've had in Vegas. Oh forgot to mention that I had a glass of pinot noir red wine.

We had a party of 20 in a private room.   1. Place smelled like a musty cooter.  2. Asked for a bruised, dirty martini - got a martini. No bruising, no dirty.  3. Found out that the staff was bringing out expensive extras like truffle butter, even though no one had asked for them.   For this price tag, I want my steak and drink to be perfect. This place got it 1/2 right.",

I'm OK with an upcharge since that's much different from the 8oz filet it normally comes with. What I have a problem with is getting charged $30 more for a steak that's only $20 more on the menu. When the manager's answer is \"that's a corporate decision\" and offers no other explanation, I think that's a really really poor answer (if I can even call it an answer).   The food was really good. I had very little waste on my porterhouse and it was very flavorful. My wife's filet was just right. The shrimp that it came with were huge and had a great bbq type sauce to go with them.   The service was very good with one glaring exception. They forgot our au gratins. When asked about it she had a blank look in her eyes. About 5 minutes later they were brought out to us and we were told our order had been burned so they made us new ones. No, they weren't. They were simply forgotten. Just say so and we'll move on, do not lie to us.   A few glitches but the food was stellar. Will we be back......I'm not sure.",

    "text": "I was looking for a place to celebrate the hubby's birthday during our stay in Vegas. Having been to the one in NY, I decided to give the Vegas one a shot. Through the pictures, I saw that it had the old school, classy ambiance, which is definitely a positive in my book. Instead of calling for reservations, I made reservations the day of through Open Table, and it was easy breezy.  Upon arriving, we were greeted warmly by the hostess(es) and after giving my name for the reservation, we were seated. It was fairly empty in the restaurant, there were perhaps four or five other tables seated. Our server was great. She came over and asked if we were celebrating anything, to which I responded that we were celebrating a birthday. She gave us plenty of time to go over our menus and went over the specials with us, pleasantly answering any questions we had. While we were still going over the menu, our server came by with a birthday card signed by the staff for my husband, which I thought was a sweet touch.  The food was excellent. Everything that came to the table was hot, not warm, so I knew it wasn't sitting around in the kitchen waiting. We ordered a shrimp cocktail and crab cake sampler appetizer. I'm allergic to crab so I couldn't taste it, but my husband and our friends said it was possibly one of the best crab cakes they ever ate. There wasn't much filling in the cake at all, just large lumps of crab.  The shrimp cocktail was tasty with the different sauce toppings: cocktail, Italian marinade and a remoulade. For entrees, I ordered the filet topped with froie gras butter and two jumbo shrimp, my husband and our friend both order the steak trio, each filet had a different topping to sample and my girlfriend ordered the beef medallions. My steak was cooked perfectly, tender and pretty much melt in your mouth. For sides, the table split the green beans in a garlic, wine sauce and the potatoes gratin. Everything was great.  The topper was the giant lemon cake slice that came out for my husband with of course, a candle. We split the cake four ways (especially since we were already quite full from dinner). Let me just say, my husband is not a fan of lemon cake, and he loved it.   Overall, this is a great place to come to celebrate a special occasion or for a romantic dinner. The service was great and the food, very appetizing. I highly recommend!",

It was so tasty and smooth I feel like I can drink the whole pitcher myself.  Vodka infused pineapples aged for xx amount of days then squeezed and served on the rocks or as a martini.    Starters:  Crab Cake - Simply amazing, fresh and full of crabs with a delightful sauce that just enhances the flavor of the crab.  To top it off the bread that they serve goes really well with the sauce, and we were told that is the right way to eat the crab cake and sauce.  Use the bread and clean the plate =).  Shanghai style calamari - Interesting, and full of flavor as well.  Sweet and spicy sauce that adds a tangy twist to the calamari yet still crispy.    Special chop salad - lettuce, blue cheese, bacon, and avocado.  Simple yet refreshing.  Main course:  Tomahawk cut of the Wagyu beef rib eye - So tender and huge, this is a portion to share between two people.   Bone in Rib eye - Cooked just the way I asked for.  Always a plus when I can get the cut cook just the way I like it.  The plate comes out piping hot so it also helps cook the meat more.  Flavorful and tender.  Sides: Cream Spinach - has bacon bits so it was really good.  MMMMmmm bacon  Lobster Mac n Cheese - This was good as well, but I would pick the spinach to be the better side of the night.   All of this food only cost us around $350, which isn't bad at all.",

I had the bone in filet, and everyone else ordered the dry aged rib eye.  Normally I'm a bone in rib eye kind of girl, so this was different for me.  We ordered asparagus, creamed spinach, and au gratin potatoes to share.  I read a few Yelp reviews before dinner, so I was prepared for the sesame bread.  It was good; nice and soft on the inside, warm, and definitely messy, as the sesame seeds were falling all over the place.  The steaks were all enjoyable.  One thing I appreciated was that we were asked to cut into our steak immediately so the doneness could be confirmed on the spot.  Another nice touch was we were actually served the sides instead of getting our own.  They also brought out a slice of cake for the birthday boy.  I don't mind paying a lot of money for my dining experiences, but it seemed a little high for what we got.",

And I'm not talking about crappy tiny 1 oz. sliders but a huge, full-sized prime burger which was fantastic. Accompanying chips were also very tasty.  Friend and I also got the crab cakes (not on bar menu), seriously one of the best around--little filler, all large chunks of crab meat, not the shredded meat crap. We also got the BBQ shrimp, fantastic. Scallops were good, not outstanding but good. I also threw in a strip steak and I don't know if it was just because I ate so much by that point or what but I thought it was good, not great.  Also $6 drinks. Needless to say I had a few VIP martinis.  Danger: sesame bread doesn't look appetizing at all but unfortunately we tried it and we were hooked. That's what did us in. It had a super crust on the outside and so soft inside and it was amazing. Totally worth blowing some carb calories on it. Really slowed me down by the time the strip came out.  I am a buffet aficionado but will be hitting this place every time I am back in LV. Everything above except for the crab cakes and strip steak were on the bar menu.",

They advertise a set menu on their website and yelp, but not on their menu or at the location.  You have to ask for the menu, but it is really good.

All of us were super excited--who wouldn't be, when potentially awesome steak is in sight?! When we arrived at the restaurant, it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be. We were seated at the very corner, next to the area where servers and bus persons bring plates and whatnot for cleaning. So there was a lot of foot traffic.   We ordered the following appetizers: Tuna tartare, shanghai-style fried calamari, and the seared Hudson valley foie gras. The tuna tartare and the foie gras were excellent. The fried calamari, however, was a huge disappointment. There were barely any calamari on the plate. Most of the dish was covered in bean sprouts drizzled in an overly sweet chili glaze.   My sister ordered a negroni to compliment the appetizers. When the cocktail arrived, it came in a chipped glass. She had to flag down our server to get this remedied. The lack of attention to detail was a bit disappointing.   For our entrees, my sister ordered the Filet Mignon and both my brother-in-law and husband ordered the dry aged ribeye. The filet was cooked properly and was seasoned well. My bro-in-law's ribeye was perfectly cooked and also seasoned well. But the ribeye that my husband and I shared was a complete disappointment. When the plate arrived, I noticed the steak had no outer crust. I love a steak with a good crust and a reddish/pink center--basically what we asked for our steak. But what we got seemed like an afterthought. The meat wasn't cooked properly, the seared crust was missing, the center was too red, and there was barely any seasoning. I understand you want to experience the actual taste of the meat, but a little salt and pepper typically enhances the flavor of the steak.   Overall, we were disappointed. I believe if you're a local, you'll probably be treated well at Del Frisco's. But if you're from out of town, maybe you're better off going to a steakhouse at The Strip.",

This drink is fabulous it taste like  lemonade  very very tasty and really enjoyable.  If you trying steaks here you should definitely go with bone in ribeye, Burgers hmmm I must say I never had any better than Del Frisco's burgers in my life.   Once again if you ever come to Del Frisco you should definitely try VIP martini.",

    "text": "Del Friscos double eagle is a must try in vegas!! The location is off the strip and away from all the traffic. I loved everything about my visit. They have a live band playing in the background which was very romantic and soothing. The service was excellent and menu was not overwhelming. The top choices would be their filet mignon, bone in ribeye, and porterhouse.   I ordered their $55 filet mignon prefix meal which came with 2 sides and my date had the bone in ribeye. Our server highly recommended getting their crab cakes and I can't agree more! It's by far the best I've had! Each bite was so savory.. so fresh. There was barely any fillers. We also ordered their lobster mac and cheese, another must have. We requested our steaks to be cooked medium rare. It was cooked right on point! Both our steaks were seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper. It was extremely tender and rich in flavor. Between the 2 of us, we still had a lot of food left over. This is definitely a great place to go for a quality dinner at a great price. I can't wait to go back!",

We got the Prime Burger and the Beef Tips. The burger was far better than the tips. You can chose between chips or fries, both are made in house and equally delicious. The patty itself was big and meaty. It could have used some salt but still one of the better burgers I've had.   The service was friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "When the sizzling steaks were delivered to our table simultaneously, a line of servers followed promptly with overflowing side dishes and served them to each guest like a beautifully rehearsed dance. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what heaven must be like...  Hold up.. let's back up a little bit... Recently in town for SEMA and decided to indulge in a nice meal.  Del Frisco's came highly recommended by my cousin, who dines here every time they're in Vegas. My husband and I are total carnivores, so we've seen our fair share of steakhouses, but I have to say, after the dining experience we had recently, Del Frisco's is pretty high up there on our list.   Everything was absolutely delicious--  For Appetizers we had the Crab Cakes, which were chocked full of huge lumps of fresh crab meat, as well as the Wagyu Beef, that just melted in your mouth.  For my Main Course I ordered the 12 oz filet which arrived perfectly cooked to my specifications. Upon first glance, it looked like a small 12 oz, but after all the sides, I wasn't complaining.  Shareable side dishes included Lobster Mac, Mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, and Gratin Potatoes-- all of which were delicious! I also had the house infused Pineapple Vodka, which was perfectly sweet and tropical.   For dessert, the Lemon Cake and Butter Cake were both to die for.  But the Banana Bread Pudding might have been the highlight of my night-- the bread pudding to top all bread puddings!  Moist, sweet, and decadent. UGH.  Zane (like from One Direction :D) was our server this past weekend for a table of 3 couples, and I don't even know where to begin.  He was amazing.  He gave perfect descriptions and wise recommendations, interacted with our dynamic group and chuckled along with us; he really made for the perfect experience.  One of the managers spent time at our table, and was also very personable.   Better than the food was the amazing service.  With the help of additional staff, plates were cleared promptly, food was delivered in perfect timing, and glasses were refilled almost after every sip.  But not in the annoying way that you feel like you're being watched.  It was all very effortless! Next time you're in Vegas, ditch the Ruth's Chris and Center Cut run of the mill steakhouses.  Spend a little more cash and visit Del Frisco's.  You will be so glad you did!",

I love that it isn't on the strip and is easy to find.  The service was great. Our server was awesome and gave awesome recommendations. I tried pretty much everything he recommended and I am so glad I did.  I started the night off with their signature cocktail, VIP. If you come here you need to try this martini. It's their pineapple infused drink and it the smoothest drink I have ever had in my life. It's one of those dangerous drinks that you can't even tell you are drinking alcohol. It was so good I had two!  I decided to get the filet mignon special for dinner. This was three, three oz steaks each with different toppings. The first was topped with brie cheese, the second was oscar style (crab, asparagus and a bearnaise sauce), and the third was topped with shrimp and a scallop. I had it prepared medium and they were so amazing! We also had a side of chateau potatoes so I wasn't able to finish the whole mean because I wanted to save room for dessert! This was totally ok with me though because that meant leftovers for the next day.  For dessert we decided to get their signature lemon cake. It was seven layer lemon cake with lemon frosting. We ate most of it but left a lot of the frosting because the cake was good enough without it.   I highly recommend this steak house for those looking to have an amazing steak dinner with great service.   Treat yourself and try it out!",

The layout of the restaurant is amazing. They have so many rooms that with lots of people dining and waiting that you don't feel crowed or overwhelming.  I was a little disappointed that for a big nice high end restaurant that you have a small bathroom to accommodate all the customers.  The service is amazing, our waiter speaks a little way too fast like he was in a competition but he does know what he's taking about, very knowledgeable guy.  The service staff that service our table was great too. Thumbs up for those guys.  The steak is amazing amazing so juicy and so good. We also had some side dishes too, such as mac and cheese, corn and much more. Side dishes are ok but will definitely go back for the steak.",

    "text": "I will say that this restaurant truly delivers and really is the ultimate steakhouse. I personally chose this steak house over SW steakhouse to celebrate my 10 year anniversary and 1 year of marriage with my wife. A lot of pressure I felt was on the line for me because I changed my plan at the last minute. Turns out it was well worth it.  Restaurant design - walking inside the restaurant was pretty cool. It had a red carpet and felt like you were vip status. Well we went inside a limo so maybe that adds to it. No greeter at the front, but no big deal. Inside the restaurant was pretty nice and can tell it was remodeled completely. Nice retro feel and lights hanging at the ceiling was pretty cool. It was pretty romantic setting, but nothing super spectacular like you expect on the strip like waterfalls or video shows etc.  Greeters - awesome greeters and were well aware of my intentions to celebrate my special moment with my wife. They gave me a few moments so that way waiters can prepare the table and keep us posted. I got walked to my table with my wife and a nice card was displayed for us with live signatures of all staff members. I found that very clever and really cool. Also it looked as though the card was original and a few hearts were recently drawn on the card as well. Enjoyed that.   Customer service - rate of 10/10.  The service and high reviews and ratings on yelp speak for itself. Tommy was my server and very professional at his job. Tommy checked on us multiple times and always was present when we needed assistance. When Tommy was helping out with a larger group that came in, another staff member helped us and introduced himself. I swear they treated myself any my wife like family. Last but not least, I remember asking for rose petals at the table which I was not too upset but was like it's alright no biggie , but eventually the manager approached my wife and delivered a dozen rose petals with a vase to her instead. Wow, I was simply blown away. Manager greeted us and followed by the assistant manager. Another staff member brought the food for us and served the steak and cut it for us. She took pictures of everything displayed at our table and we didn't even have to ask. We got complimentary dessert as well which is awesome too and didn't expect it. And yes they even bagged our food and placed plastic silverware inside. Truly spectacular service. Mad props to the general manager and her staff.   Food - spectacular 10/10. My wife and I ordered king Alaskan crab as an appetizer, cut to perfection which allowed us to pull out at the top with no problem to share. Bread was offered and three different flavors to choose for sauce. Pretty neat there. Main course was a three piece steak like 4 ounces each, but with each different flavors and toppings on top like shrimp and crab. Highly worth it for the price and cooked to perfection. Definitely make sure you get the lobster Mac and cheese and also the spinach. Sides made the steak even more enjoyable.   Overall - you are not going to get the best view or shall I say like see waterfalls, spectacular views or video display shows or anything else unlike other restaurants on the strip of course. Small restaurant inside and definitely doesn't appeal to the strip atmosphere like bigger is better and more glamorous then all other places etc etc etc. However , this is truly a unique restaurant. Whoever said you need all that stuff to have a good time. This restaurant defines that and truly represents the best of its class on steak at it's finest. Customer service here is truly hard to beat. I work as a mortgage loan officer and I know when I see good service. Talk about a restaurant that truly spoils you. They deserve all bragging rights.  Job well done. Restaurant core values start at service and the level of food. That's all I needed.  By the way, my wife and I ended up going to SW steakhouse two days later and overall was so so. Once you enjoy a spectacular dinner at Frisco's, you expect the same amount of delivery or would like to see same amount of quality and service wise. Not close compared to Frisco's. Definitely coming back when we come back to Vegas again.   Last but not least, I truly believe this was the best restaurant dining experience ever. It was even better at a restaurant that I proposed to my wife in San Ramon ca and that was prepared in two month advance. Love this place and highly recommend Frisco's. Thank you so much for the experience and the memory for life. Cheers.",

    "text": "My first time eating at Del Frisco's. We chose here for our last night dining in Vegas. We had a 8:30pm reservation and were seated promptly. I was surprised for a Saturday night that it was not that busy.   For appetizers we had the crab cake which was exceptional as well as the shrimp cocktail. Shrimp cocktail were good but I didn't like the fact they were served with the cocktail sauce poured over it. It was a little on the sweet side and I would have liked to control how much sauce I put on it. After that we shared a ceaser salad which was tasty. For entrees we shared the 16 ounce NY strip with asparagus and mashed for our sides. Mashed were delicious. Asparagus lacked flavor but the sliced almonds helped.  Dessert we went with the butter cake served with pecan ice cream. This was absolutely amazing. Very rich the two of us could not finish it.   As far as service it was exceptional. All the waiters were extremely attentive. I hold back 5 stars because I ordered the steak medium and it was more on the rare side. The beef was very tender and still had great flavor.  One tip I want to add, they have an extensive wine list and if you know your wines they have some exceptional values on the list that are extremely underpriced. 2 cocktails, bottle of wine , shrimp cocktail, crab cake, ceaser salad, steak, asparagus, mashed and dessert came to 300 including tip. I think it's a good value when you take into account the dining choices located in the resorts. Great meal!",

    "text": "I chose Del Friscos over beef wellingtons at Gordon Ramsays because of the strong recommendations my two gfs had made about the steaks here.    Not as snobby fancy as let's say, Mastros or CUT, much more casual and old school in ambiance and decor.  Which I prefer as higher end restaurants make me feel too stuffy.    We ordered 2 glasses of Malbec which Pinky loved, he ended up drink 2 3/4 glasses.. the 3/4 glass was mine that I didn't want to finish.    The complimentary bread they gave us smelled so yummy and was so soft, but I wish there was more of a distinct flavor to it.    Ordered a dozen of their oysters (half east coast, half west... I only remember one of the names, Stellar Bay).  The oysters were tasty, but I had to tweak their mignonette a little to my liking by adding some salt and pepper.  The real downside of the oysters though was how sloppily they were shucked!  There was shell in every single oyster!  We were literally spitting out pieces of shell for every oyster we ate which has never been the case for anywhere we've eaten oysters till now.    Asparagus cooked with almonds, salt, pepper, and butter.  There was no butter on asparagus, but that worked out for us as we preferred it without any butter however I think some people might not appreciate that.  I wish there was a little spritz of lemon in this side to bring out the fresh flavors more.    Lobster mac and cheese was my pick.  Lobster in mac and cheese, exactly how it would taste if you took a piece of lobster and ate it with your mac and cheese.  Not crazy special in my opinion, mac and cheese itself was just okay.  Didn't blow this cheese fanatic's mind.    Shared the American kobe long bone for $90(?), the sides of the meat were buttery and so tender, however when we got to the center it started to lose the flavor we were enjoying.  To be honest the center of the American Kobe became somewhat tough, not flap meat tough, but it definitely was not tender enough to be considered anything kobe in our books.  The seasoning of the meat though was really good, perfectly salted with a tasty crust and the perfect temperature of medium rare.    Lemon cake, yum-o!  I love lemon cake!  What's surprising was that Pinky enjoyed this cake as well and he hates all things lemon!  What's good about this cake is that it has the perfect amount of lemon flavor, just enough for the lemon lovers and not too much for people who aren't fans.  The frosting was pretty sweet, but it was a perfect complement to the not too sweet cake and filling.  The cake itself looks plain Jane, but it's quite tasty!  Idk if I'd come back just because I feel pretty meat-ed out after that meal.  If were to though, I'd come and try their ribeye or filet instead.",

    "text": "A friend highly recommended this restaurant so we decided to try it for my wife's birthday dinner. We showed around 6pm and the restaurant was empty. We were seated 5 minutes later into an empty room and the servers were very friendly. Everything is bad from there. We ordered their summer prie fix New York for $49 and tomahawk for $95. As we are working through our salad a few flies come by and starts bugging us and tries to land on our food. I alert the waiter and he says it's because of construction. Ok, sure no biggie. The flies didn't stop and a manager comes by seeing that we were trying to swat them. We have a conversation about it and she just laughs it off like it's nothing and moved along.   The steaks come out, I ordered medium rare but it came out rare. I didn't get to mention this to the waiters since they were slammed at this point and didn't come by for awhile. When I did mention it, he said he wouldn't mention it to our waiter, but never got back. After one of the flies started to get close to my steak I swatted it and it lands on our table. I wanted to show them but I guess that sucker wasn't dead. It got up after a few minutes and started to bug me the whole time I was trying to eat my steak. At this point I was over it and wanted to get the bill. No one for awhile longer. A couple workers come by to clean up and asked if they could take my plate. I was a bit hesitant (since I wanted to show our server how raw my steak was) and they ended up just taking the plate anyways since it was already in his hand and I was over it. They surprised us with a birthday desert (after about 10 minutes after taking our plates). I asked for our check it and it comes almost immediately.  Overall, the bill with tip is $200 (172 + 28 tip) for a undercooked 32 ounce tomahawk and New York meal with truffle butter. I'm sure you can find a pleasurable experience and meal other places in Vegas...",

    "text": "It is hard choosing where to have your Valentines Day dinner in a city like Las Vegas. There are so many great options to choose from, that overthinking your choice can become a problem.   Fortunately, I chose Del Frisco's and my date was very happy. As expected, the place was packed but we were seat right at our reservation time. It is a large restaurant that is sectioned off into several smaller rooms, which was a smart decision, as it keeps the noise insulated and makes for a more intimate setting. It has an old school look to it, a lot of wood and purposely faded paint on the walls.   Our server was very courteous and helpful, and made ordering very simple. We ended up having foie gras and calamari as starters, followed by our main which was the 32oz wagyu bone-in ribeye with mushrooms and asparagus (we split it of course). Everything was simply fantastic, but the stand outs were the ribeye and the mushrooms. The ribeye just melted in your mouth and the mushrooms ate like a delicious steak. Super good.   For dessert, we had the Godiva Mousse cake and the lemon cake. Be warned, the portions were surprisingly large - especially the lemon cake. It could easily be split between two people, maybe three. Needlessly to say, we boxed it up after such a big meal and will probably be digging into it later today. :)",

I let them know it was our anniversary, and when we arrived, they had a special corner table set up for us with an anniversary card and decorations.   We started with the bacon, which they served and cut for us, and it was divine! Just the right amount of smoke flavor and very tender. I had the ribeye and hubs went with the dry aged rib eye. The difference between the aged and non-aged is noticeable in the texture and slightly different flavor. But both steaks were cooked to perfection, and everything you could ask for in a steak. Our sides were the creamed spinach and del's potato, both were delicious.   Can I just say that the service was over the top, fantastic! The servers were attentive, pleasant, and even the manager stopped by to wish us a happy anniversary. We ended the night with a celebratory butter cake which put us into a food-coma. Definitely an anniversary dinner to remember.",

Also our host, I couldn't hear if her name was Melanie or Melody, I apologize, but thank you for being awesome as well. The food was AMAZING! Just as amazing as the STAFF!

SHE LOVED IT and is now spoiled. Lol.  Had a couple of house margaritas ($8) and a Chimay Red ($16) at the bar while waiting for our table. Both good!!!    This was the first time we tried the onion rings.  Amazingly big. Crunchy and tasty!  And well...their crabcakes?  Delicious. You cannot go to Del Friscos and not get their crabcakes.  I mean it's all crab!!  Need I say more?    Tried the shrimp platter this time and it was not disappointing. (We normally get the shrimp cocktail, but tried something new)  The shrimps are big and meaty.  Mmmm...mmmmm!  We ordered a porterhouse (ate it before I remembered to take a photo) & it was good. (Sent it back as it was a bit too rare...but when It came back...perfectly cooked)    Mom had the 8oz filet. She dug in before a photo too. LOL.   Everything was great.   And the best part for mom was dessert. The butter cake!  OH WOW!  Please order this. Lol. It's sooo good.    Can't wait ti get back!!!",

    "text": "Due to a reservation error at another restaurant, we decided to make a super last minute reservation at Del Frisco's for my birthday dinner. Since I had visited the New York location and was extremely satisfied with my service, I was excited to try the Las Vegas location.  I made reservations for 5 people for 8pm, and we were quickly seated upon arrival. Right away, we had someone come and explain the wine menu to us as well as bring out bread (which is delicious! Warm and fluffy!) We ordered a bottle of champagne for the table, and they were quick to bring out the bottle, and make sure our glass was always filled.   My husband and I decided to split a 12oz filet mignon, cooked medium, and crab cake. The filet was cooked perfectly, but the crab cake had a little too much lobster sauce, and wasn't as full or as good as the New York location. My friend ordered the salmon, which comes with mashed potatoes. She seemed happy. My brother and his girlfriend shared a shrimp appetizer and a bruschetta dish. They both seemed satisfied with there order.  Because we were celebrating my birthday, a birthday dessert which consisted of butter cake (heavenly) and a dark chocolate cake (yum) was brought out. I definitely recommend the butter cake if you have room, it's amazingly delicious!  Overall, I was pretty happy with our dinner and service. Although I will say that the New York location was a little better when it came to the food. Even though this place is located off strip, I look forward to my next trip to Del Frisco's.",

Kudos, it's terrific that they don't require everyone at the table to order the set menu. I'm sure it's confusing for the kitchen and for the servers but the flexibility was sure appreciated.   The meal is definitely more than a \"pair\" as you get a nice salad (the wedge salad was SO good) AND an entree (salmon, yum) AND a beautiful crab cake full of lump meat PLUS a delicious side (creamed spinach is chunky like a spinach dip.) You might also be surprised to learn that the side served with the prix fixe menu is actually a full order and not a half. It's a LOT of food!   On a summertime Saturday night, the dining room was about 3/4 full. It's a fairly peaceful place despite the efforts of the live musician playing classics and odd renditions of newer songs lol. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Staff work as a team on just about everything and with minimal chitchat. The restaurant and restrooms are impeccably clean. This is a very well run operation.   Non-steak eaters rejoice! You, too, will do just fine here.",

I've ate at plenty of \"fine dining establishments\" in my life and have never been treated to foully! This behavior is definitely not what I would classify as \"fine dining\".

The crab cake was my least favorite appetizer. Very mushy. Two friends and I decided to go for it and share the double eagle. And we went crazy with the add ons. Gimme that truffle, foie butter, and king crab! Made the steak super decadent. Wines were priced well. We were able to find two bottles around $50 each. Service was great. Our waiter was super sweet.

    "text": "Was in LV on a business trip with a group of my coworkers, and one of them organized a group dinner to Del Frisco's for 9 people.   We got there at 6:45pm and it was very crowded in the waiting area, so we moved out to the patio because we were still waiting for one person (and they won't seat you unless you have absolutely everyone in your party). While we were sitting out on the patio, waitstaff was coming out to take orders from another group that was out there but never stopped to ask if we wanted anything (we were hoping to at least order drinks while we were waiting).   Once we finally got seated, I was shocked at how crowded the room they lead us to was. There were large groups everywhere and the chairs were literally back to back, which might not have been a huge problem except the waitstaff still had to get through to serve. I was baffled why you would lay out a room like that and not leave walking room between chairs for even the wait staff.  It was at least 15 minutes before a waiter stopped at our table, we asked for a wine list and didn't get that for another 30 minutes. He tried to tell us the specials but it was so loud in there we basically couldn't hear anything he was saying. It was probably another 30-45 minutes before he came back to take our orders.    The only saving grace of this place was probably the food. I got the sea bass and thought it was delicious. Sides are not included, so they force you to order them separately, which or course adds a ton of cost.  One of the mashed potatoes we ordered was not edible because it was so salty, but the other one was ok so not sure what happened there. Overall everyone was generally happy with their meal though. I would like to note there is literally not one vegetarian option on their menu, but they were able to make a pasta primavera for the lone vegetarian we had in the group.  Although the food was tasty, it was not enough to offset my displeasure with the cramped seating and atmosphere. I would personally not choose to come here with a group ever again.",

After tasting the food, we quickly realized that Del Frisco's is not what it used to be.  Our steaks were very tough and chewy.  Tasted almost old. It was a very bad experience.

They had the table set up with a congrats card and rose petals, which was very nice.  We started with a bunch of apps, the first of which was a seafood sampler, everyone got 1/2 crab cake, 3 shrimp in different sauces and a stone crab claw.  They were very fresh and tasty.  We also had oysters (east & west coast), a huge serving of bacon, carpaccio, and charred octopus, they were all great.  We then had steaks, including the wagyu tasting, filet mignons and 45 day aged strip.  All were cooked perfectly.  We added 2 16 oz lobster tails to round out the main course along with several sides.   The service started off great, with the waiter and attendants very prompt and professional.  By the end, however, with the restaurant becoming full, the attention level fell off quite a bit.  One thing that did bother me; we got charged for a \"Celebration\" dessert that was provided for my daughter and her new husband.  We did not order this, and assumed is was complimentary, that was odd.  I kind of ignored this, as the $10 was a drop in the ocean that was the bill.  Bring your wallet, this place is great but will cost you a mortgage payment.  Outstanding place for a special occasion!",

Tonight we celebrated a promotion I received and as usual Del Frisco's made me feel special! The hostess warmly greeted us and then congratulated me on my promotion (as well as complement my outfit but that was an added bonus) and gave us the best seats in the house. Our servers, Roe and Collin were great! Roe had such great energy and knowledge and Collin was very friendly and attentive. They also congratulated me and made small talk about my new position, but most importantly, THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! The steaks were cooked exactly how we wanted and so flavorful. It just melts in your mouth! I tried the Trio filets this time and I was extremely happy with my decision and we also got some VIP and Old Fashioned cocktails as well as the jumbo crab cake to share. Did I mention the crab cake there is Life?! It's worth every penny! We'll definitely be back no doubt about that, but I wanted to thank the staff and managers for making my evening extra special tonight. Thank you!",

Our food was on point as well. Everyone's dishes were cooked to perfection and everyone on the serving team made sure our drinks were never empty, made sure we all had what we needed and again, made it that much more better.

    "text": "I wouldn't say this was the best steak that I've eaten in my life.  But as an overall experience I would say this was one of the better steakhouses I've been to.    I'm not usually one to blow big bucks at a steakhouse, not when we can usually prepare very good steaks at home, especially with the quality of beef you can get at mail order and high-end grocers nowadays.  Instead, I usually spend my high-end dining dollars on restaurants with multiple-course tasting menus that would be hard for me to execute at home.  Also, steakhouses usually charge extra for sides, have sky-high markups for wine, and usually don't take (or have really expensive) corkage.  However, my husband (who does most of the actual steak-cooking in the house anyway) does like to eat out for steak occasionally, and it is a nice change from all the other\"frou-frou\" restaurants that I like to frequent.  I gotta say though, that this place is actually *gasp* a decent value for the money, especially for Vegas where you can easily spend $100 on a single steak.  My friend and I split one of their specials, a bone-in Wagyu Tomahawk ribeye, and it wound up costing us $45 apiece.  Our husbands, who got standalone ribeye steaks of their own (no bone) were definitely jealous as ours was just so much juicier and more tender.  I don't think I've ever been to any other steakhouse where you can get Wagyu for that much.  The steak was perfectly cooked (medium-rare of course!) and I have no complaints about it whatsoever.  The appetizers we ordered, tuna tartare and crab cake, were tasty and well-executed, though not particularly exciting.  But then, this was an old-school type of place so I wasn't exactly expecting cutting-edge.  The sides were also pretty decent...I'm not a big fan of potatoes au gratin but my dining companions enjoyed it, the mushrooms were flavorful but did not overpower the steak.  We didn't order dessert since we were already stuffed from all the steak and even had leftovers.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced as well.  We started off with their signature cocktail...a martini-like concoction with pineapple juice.  It was very refreshing and a good start to the meal.  They also had a very expansive wine list (they better since they don't let you bring outside wine) with many great selections of California cabs, my wine of choice for a good steak.  I was very pleased to note that they had a special section devoted to lesser-known producers that were also more affordable.  Unlike many other steakhouses that tend to push the customer towards higher priced wines (I'm looking at you Alexander's and Harbour Sixty), our server was very happy to talk to us about some of the smaller wineries on the list.  We finally settled on a 2007 Terra Valentine cab from Spring Mountain (one of the less famous Napa valley appellations) which went perfectly with all our steaks.    The service overall was extremely good...they asked us at the beginning if we had a show to catch so they could pace the dinner accordingly, they called us a taxi to take us back at the perfect time, and even showed us their \"James Bond table\".  This was definitely one of the best service that I've seen for a steakhouse.  One of the best values for a steakhouse, and one of the best values overall in the city.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone craving a steak in Las Vegas.",

Here is what was ordered:  Appetizers: Calamari - very tasty, perfectly seasoned - try it, new twist on an old favorite Shrimp Cocktail: 5 large jumbo shrimp with cocktail sauce Crab Cake: very dense, pretty much all crab meat with some tasty sauce  Steaks: my friend and I each ordered the 10 oz ribeye with potatoes (lagniappe) (still a large portion - I could have split the steak) my husband ordered the 16 oz ribeye her husband ordered the bone in  Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese - yummy! Some of my friends didn't this dish as much as the Mastro's Mac & Cheese, but I thought it was very tasty Spinach Supreme - YOU MUST ORDER THIS. Enough said. Bacon. String Beans - crisp, we felt we needed a veggie side. Not bad, not good, it's a veggie, after all  Dessert: Lemon cake - YOU MUST ORDER THIS.  The slice is very generous, enough for each person in the group to take a few bites Sorbet - three different flavors: mango, pineapple and raspberry - all very good  Wine: We ordered a bottle of red (I'm not very wine savvy so I'm not sure which one it was...07 something, was about $100.  I liked it a lot)   2 friends split the 10oz ribeye + potatoes, another 2 split the filet.  I think the smaller portions were perfect. Everyone left satisfied but not disgustingly stuffed.  I think it was very reasonably priced, the entire bill for 8 people was about $550 (gratuity not included) - when does that ever happen??  The only downside, which I won't count against the restaurant, is that it is located off-strip.  But, if I think about it, the off-strip location may actually be a good thing.    All in all a wonderful dining experience.  They asked for us to leave contact information so they can send us handwritten thank you notes!!  Too bad there isn't one in LA :(",

Service was excellent and upscale..but not TOO upscale..a nice blazer and jeans kinda upscale.  When I went it was for a Xmas party so we had great atmosphere with 40+ people in a private room. As I walked by some other rooms they seemed kinda quiet and boring...but that's why you bring GOOD company...Lots of a business types (age demo in 40's), and cougars by the bar with a nice live piano man touch...Im a grad student so can't go there too often...a  bit $$$$ BUT..love, love, love the food. Seafood apps were the best as well!  Nice place for a date IF your date really appreciates steak!",

Great food and great service go hand in hand here! So this time here I started off with the house salad with blue cheese, very, very nice! Came with 2 strips of thick, crispy bacon-always welcome!  Bf had the crab cakes with a Cajun sauce.  Very good also.  Was 1 big crab cake but was a nice size.  Was very creamy, no seafoody detection there.  The Cajun sauce was very good, complimented the cake well. We both had the beef! LOL, don't come to a steak place and order the chicken people, I'm just sayin..... Ugh, the filet was just all melty and rich and seasoned to perfection!  Cooked to perfection! We also had the potatoes au gratin which were a creamy delight!  The potatoes were bluntly cut but nice and soft and covered in cheesy, creamy goodness. MMmmmmmm And also the sauteed green beans, I didn't try them they were a little too garlicky for my taste but bf said they were right on.",

    "text": "I love steak! So it only made sense that I ate at a steakhouse at least once while vacationing in Las Vegas.  Seeing Del Frisco's (then yelping, of course) on the way to my hotel, my mom and I decided to try it!  We started off with the Classic Caesar Salad, which the waitress kindly divided onto two plates, as I was sharing with my mom. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had!  With an already satisfied pallet, I couldn't wait for the steak.  We ordered the Filet Mignon with a side of Au Gratin potatoes.  The steak, seasoned with some salt and pepper,  was definitely top notch.  Though I prefer Ruth's Chris, the steak came in a close second!  Juicy & melts in your melt, the steak satisfied my craving right off the bat.  The potatoes were delicious, as well...and I know my potatoes, so when I say delicious, I mean it!  Melted cheese piled on top of slices of potatoes is just how I like it.  Afterwards, I was so full I couldn't even order dessert!  Overall, Del Frisco's is definitely worth a try if you're craving steak.  Make sure you go when you're hungry, so you have room to try everything on the menu!  Great service & great food, this place is an A+ in my book!",

    "text": "No doubt about it, these guys are legit. Simply the best steak you can possibly have. Went to Vegas for Super Bowl weekend (see my review of the Encore) and in keeping with our theme of rolling hard and deep, we made a reservation for a saturday night. The joint was packed, even with a reservation and showing up on time, we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The wait was definitely worth it. The wife ordered raspberry martini, thinking it was a fru-fru drink, I ordered the VIP martini. It turns out there's no such thing as a fru-fru drink here; the raspberry martini was stronger than my VIP. Our meal started off with fried oyster appetizer. It was quite tasty; crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Squeeze some lemon juice and dip in the marinara sauce and you're set. My wife ordered the 12 oz filet, she wanted the 8 oz but I pointed out for just $5 more you can get 50% more steak goodness. And if she can't finish it, I will always be there to clean up. I ordered their signature dish, the double eagle aka el duce, the shitznit, da bomb, the best steak you can have! Go big or go home steak! Both steaks were ordered medium rare, and arrived as ordered. They made you cut into the steaks to inspect the doneness just to make sure you're satisfied when they serve them to you. Needless to say, the meal was epic! The service was top notch, besides our waiter, there were at least 3 assistant waiters/waitress checking in on us at about every 10 minutes. If you're looking to splurge on a steak, you cannot go wrong with Del Frisco's.",

They have the biggest wine list I've seen in Vegas restaurants, and the wait-persons are prompt, efficient, and get everything right.  I'm in town one more night this visit and am coming back for one more Bone-In Ribeye because it's better than any I'm able to get back home in San Diego.

I opted for the Del Frisco's salad over the wedge, nothing spectacular.  The crab cake, filet itself, with the side of grilled(?) mushrooms I chose were delicious.  I've been in Vegas 4 years and I wish I had tried this steakhouse sooner (even though it's part of a chain). - Also got the pineapple infused martini (next to some tables there are massive jars with pineapple wedges marinating in the liquor), I think that was $13/ea.  Tasty. - My compatriots also enjoyed their meal and we all satiated the appetites we built up making the trek here.",

    "text": "Grabbed a cab and headed over to Del Friscos arriving to find a dated kinda worn feel to it. Not comparable to a classy Chicago Steakhouse but more of a casual comes as you are feel,  The martini was well prepared and the portion was nice.  I am one for aesthetics and the first one that grabbed me was that the salad fork is the same size as the dinner fork. Call me weird, but I like big man sized utensils  for $50 dollar steaks.   Now about that crab appetizer.  Being from the wine country, I know I am spoiled but if a big hunk crab mixed with a monstrous amount of Old Bay is your thing, you have come to the right place.  I will eat crab served with cardboard I like it so much, but truly just so so.  Next was the Wedge salad with blue cheese. This dish can be great when done right but if the lettuce is wet and leaking, the dressing and everything else turns mushy and bland.  But, drums please, the steak shines.  There I was with my miniature fork drinking some great cab and enjoying the heck out of my tender flavorful steak with some pretty tasty corn, spinach and mashed potatoes. (Yes I did order three sides.)  So maybe skip everything else and have a steak.  Great bartender was very well versed in the wine offerings and made the night a fun one.",

    "text": "Wow. My fiance and I came here for valentine's day after reading all of the wonderful reviews on yelp. I'm starting to wonder how many of the wonderful reviews on here are fake. I thought the food (besides the steak) tasted absolutely horrible.  The heirloom tomato and onion salad was gross. It had a vinegarette on it that tasted very odd and bland. The blue cheese crumbles on top even tasted terrible, because of the dressing. I was barely able to eat one slice of tomato, even after trying to season it with salt, pepper, and more vinegar. I'm pretty sure the waiter could tell that I didn't enjoy the dish when he came over and I had him take away the full plate of food, but he never said anything or asked. A good restaurant,would have been concerned that they had an unhappy guest. So that was weird...   Our steak was delicious & perfectly medium-rare. The sides that we ordered, the  corn and the mashed potatoes were not good.  They both tasted like hospital/cafeteria food. We each had a few bites and that was all we could stomach before having them take that away as well.  It was very disappointing. Also, the bread was served on a paper doily and looked like a cheap hamburger bun, I should have known better as soon as I saw that, it was a great predictor of what was to come.   Another thing I didn't like about this place was the overly bright lighting and the close proximity to other patrons. It was so unromantic.  And the decor was bad too, it was very late '90's/early 00's-ish.  I could have sworn I was at Sizzler, not a nice steakhouse.    I should also note that we didn't appear to be the only unhappy guests that night, because we were so close to the other guests & it was so bright, we got to see and hear it all.",

    "text": "We visited the Double Eagle on Sunday evening for dinner. The restaurant has a large parking lot so there was no need to use the valet. There appeared to be several separate dining rooms in the restaurant, and with our reservation we were seated quickly in a very nice wood-panelled room with modern art hanging on the walls.   My lady ordered the filet medallions which was one of the specials of that evening. I went for the Sunday-only Prime Pair prix fixe special, which included my choice of salad, my choice of one side dish, and an 8-oz filet paired with one of three seafood items. I chose scallops for the latter.   For my salad I chose the Caesar, and it was OK, if a little on the boring side. My side was the sauteed mushrooms, which were fine but certainly not exceptional. My 8-oz filet was brought out by itself on a fairly large plate, missing the scallops. I thought those scallops must be coming along shortly - and for some reason they would be getting served by themselves even though there was a lot of room on that plate with the filet.   So we dine on, and I must say my filet, which I ordered medium rare, was some of the best beef I have ever tasted. We have dined at most of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas, on the strip and off, and my filet at the Double Eagle stands out as the best yet. My lady was very happy with her three 4-oz filet medallions.  One medallion had a shrimp topping, one had a crab and asparagus topping, and the third had a melted Brie topping. She had a glass of red Zinfandel with her meal, which tasted a bit rough and on the harsh side even after sitting in the glass for awhile.   When I was about halfway through my filet I thought I'd better let them know that my scallops were MIA. I let the server know and a few minutes later two scallops were brought out in a tiny glass dish that was likely designed to serve a condiment like mustard or ketchup. The scallops were sitting lopsided in that dish in some butter and watery liquid with some capers in there too. This was very unappetizing; I expected maybe the two scallops would be broiled and served on a skewer. I tried one and got that gritty scallop crunch on the first bite which turned me off immediately. Their flavor was OK but it seemed to me that one more day waiting around to be cooked would have made these scallops inedible. I did not finish the scallops.  A few minutes after my scallops came out the manager of the restaurant, Anthony, came to our table and apologized profusely about the scallops arriving late. He was sincerely concerned and genuinely apologetic; it was clear that this Del Frisco's takes their service very seriously.  I was cool about it; sometimes things like this happen and we were there to have a good time. We appreciated the personal attention by the manager.  As soon as we finished our meal our server brought out a huge slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake for us to share and told us Anthony was comping this for us because of the issue with the scallops. This is the kind of service and dedication to customer satisfaction that are expected at the highest-end restaurants, and the Las Vegas Double Eagle delivers.   We will definitely return to Del Frisco's Double Eagle and give them another chance to earn that fifth star.",

    "text": "I love steak like any non-vegetarian citizen of the US of A and have a list of favorites including The Golden Steer and Delmonico's to name a few, but when I'm feeling absolutely baller and want the best quality in both service and food, I come to Del Frisco's.  STEAKAGE: The menu here features the standards like filet mignon, ribeye, porterhouse, etc. which is all fine and dandy but when I come here, I specifically want their specials.  Dishes that aren't offered at your typical steakhouse, such as:  Double eagle bone-in prime strip (contrary to popular belief, this is not made with two eagles...it's made with three), bone in filet mignon, the filet mignon trio, or my personal favorite:  32-oz WAGYU RIBEYE with tomahawk bone.  To put it in perspective of how amazing this steak is, I will make a list titled \"News I Never Want to Hear\" (in order):  1. Del Frisco's no longer serves the wagyu rib-eye 2. Zooey Deschanel and Ben Gibbard happily back together! 3. Liam Neeson furious with Michael O's Yelp review of Fresh Brothers pizza.  \"I will find him,\" swears the terrifying actor.  SIDE DISHES: 1. Cream spinach: 2. Lobster mac & cheese 3. Chateau potatoes: I love potatoes in all its forms - mashed, baked, roasted, fried, you name it.  Chateau potatoes are basically upgraded seasoned/buttery mashed potatoes with scallions & pepper.  TIPS: 1. To really live it up, be prepared to drop up to $100 per person.  Coming here on a tight budget is as dumb as coming here on a full stomach. 2. ORDER THE WAGYU RIBEYE and split it with another person (if need be). 3. Before you leave, ask to see the James Bond table.  Grade: I don't always eat steak, but when I do...I prefer Del Frisco's.",

We started with the calamari, it was in a spicy chili sauce with bean sprouts and scallions. It had a nice crunch, and wasn't rubbery,  the lobster macaroni and cheese excellent, wish I had room to eat more!  Brussel sprouts, the nights special, nothing grand.  Mushrooms, again nothing special.  My MIL loved her crab cakes, they looked good and were giant portions. my filet was cooked perfect for me and the black truffle butter was delish.  My husband wasn't as happy with his Osso Bucco veal shank, i had a bite, it had very nice flavor, but was a little dry. Overall good experience!  And the James Bond table was neat.",

Onions rings were the largest I've ever had in my life! Also very good! Even the bread before our meal was amazing! We also really enjoyed the outside patio area where we had our cigars after our meal. Amazing food, great service, highly recommended, must have for all steak lovers!",

Everything about the restaurant was excellent - except for the food and drink.   My Cosmo was undrinkable and nowhere near mixed right.    My filet had a lot of grizzle. The au gratin potatoes were monstrously bad. I was rooting for them but it's a non traditional recipe that seems like cubed potatoes smothered in cheddar cheese. Nothing close to Flemings potatoes which are pretty much heaven on earth.     Saving graces. My wife's crab cake was excellent and her steak was 4. Her spinach was not edible. Way too much bacon.   As another poster says this location pales to the mid town Manhattan location and sadly pales in comparison to most local steak houses including chains like Flemings.   Glad we tried but honestly I don't see us returning.",

As far as I can remember the menu hasn't changed in all the years we've been coming here and neither has what I ordered.  Freshly Baked Bread, Shrimp Remoulade, Del's Salad, Bone-in Ribeye Medium Rare and the Bone-in Pork Chop for my wife.  Never disappointed. This place is simple and classy.  As far as price, I say you get what you pay for and this place is worth every penny. No loud banging club music or other distractions.  Sometimes if you're lucky, there is a guy singing some classic Billy Joel at the piano which is always great for date night.",

    "text": "My cousin and I only had one nice dinner in Vegas during our short stay and decided to ball out. Since she's a steak girl this was our choice, especially after my bf raved about the one in NYC.  I made the reservations on Open Table for a Monday evening with no issues. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. We were seated and our waiter welcomed us and handed us the menus. My bf had given me a heads up that they offered a Filet Mignon trio that I wouldn't find on the menu so I had my mind set on this already even prior to seeing the menu (which I had already reviewed online prior to our dinner). My cousin got the same thing. The Filet's came our perfectly cooked. They were topped with 1) Broiled Shrimp 2) Brie 3) Crab, Asparagus, Bernaise. They were delicious but got me full all too quick. We also got the Spinach Supreme and Potatoes Au Gratin for our side dishes also. This was wayy more than enough food for 2 females. As if we hadn't already ordered too much, we decided to finish our gluttonous meal off with a Banana Bread Pudding w/ Caramel which we decided to share. Our hungry stomachs definitely got the best of us and we brought the left-overs back to our hotel which my cousin ate the next day.   Del Frisco's was a really nice restaurant. They also had someone playing the Piano for most of the evening. Service was great and food was good. I'd definitely recommend this steakhouse.",

Bring me your biggest Prime Bone-In Ribeye. Cook it medium rare, and don't fuck it up.   I'm basically a Vegas local and have had the BiR at Prime, Delmonico's, Carnevino, Gallagher's, Gordan Ramsey's, The Golden Steer, and Vic & Anthony's. V&A has always been my favorite, and I have had it countless times. It's usually our default steakhouse. Tonight, we decided on steaks at the last minute and couldn't get in at V&A in a timely fashion, so we just whipped into Del Frisco's and sat at the bar.   Other than V&A, I'm not a big fan of going to a \"chain\" joint in a town like LV with all its' great options, but The BiR at Del Frisco's is simply one of the best I have ever had. Served on a super hot plate, juicy, tender and flavor that knocked my socks off. Service from Trish was nothing short of phenomenal. $150 plus $50 tip for 2 BiR, baked potatoes, iced teas. Definitely going back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for his 38th birthday. His all-time favorite meal is very simply, a steak and potato. I did my diligent research and decided on Del Frisco's for a special night out. I made an Open Table reservation for 6PM, as we had a show to catch later on that evening. I made a small notation in the reservation that it was his birthday but didn't think anything more of it.  That evening, we arrived and were warmly greeted by the friendly hostess. She wished my BF a happy birthday and chatted with us for a moment before another hostess took us to our table.   On our table was a birthday card, hand-signed by the entire Del Frisco's staff, and our server came over immediately and introduced himself. He, also, was named Matt and just celebrated his 38th birthday, so it was quite humorous. He was very friendly and attentive the entire night, giving us recommendations when asked, but never was pushy.  We decided on the seafood plateau for an appetizer. We both had the VIP drink -- a must try. The seafood was absolutely perfect. The sauces that accompanied the seafood were also to-die-for!  After a quick chat with Matt the server about what type of steak we like best (my BF prefers marbling and taste over tenderness), we made our choices. I ordered one of the specials of the evening -- a trio of filets, each with a different topping. My BF ordered the Waygu bone in steak. We also ordered a baked potato side, although it merely out of habit to have an accompaniment.  In between courses, we were always checked on, crumbs wiped away, water refilled, and drinks brought out when asked. It was superior service, and I don't exaggerate.   Our entrees were brought out and the steaks were beautiful. My BF's Waygu looked like it could have been off of a dinosaur it was so large! The taste, though, was unlike anything I've had...and I love a great steak. Juicy, flavorful, and tender. It couldn't be beat.  My filet trio was divine as well. After a couple of drinks and the seafood appetizer, I could only tackle one of the filets. (I'm a notoriously small eater) I really wanted to stuff myself, but knew better, especially since the night was still young.   My BF tackled his entire steak and, I think, his eyes rolled back into his head a few times in sheer bliss. He was a happy boy! :)  We took a few obligatory bites of the potato, but the meat is where it's at!   We were asked if we had room for dessert, and, of course, we did now. However, we were brought a large slice of the house lemon cake with a candle. I tasted it, and, I swear, it was one of the most moist, delicate, delicious pieces of cake I have had -- and I'm a Southern girl who loves her sweets! It was the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness, not heavy at all.   The server asked if we were staying somewhere that we could take back what we hadn't eaten (my two other filets, the potato, and most of the cake). We were, so he boxed everything separately and placed it in a bag for us.   I consider myself a pretty keen foodie, and I am not easily impressed with showy foods or pomp and circumstance. I, however, was VERY impressed with both the service and food at Del Frisco's.   Flash forward to two days after we were back home -- my BF received a hand written card from our server thanking us for celebrating at Del Friscos. THAT was impressive.  We will definitely be back in next time we are in Vegas and recommend to anyone who wants their tastebuds to be spoiled rotten.",

    "text": "There's just way too much food here! I made reservation for this stand alone restaurant located among all the business building off the strip of Las Vegas. The boyfriend and I came for the $99 power couple special. Regular price will burn a serious hole in my wallet.   Anyways, so the special was a 3-course meal for each. I went for the Del's Salad, the 8 oz. filet and signature crab cake with Chateau potatoes for the side and banana bread pudding for dessert. The filet was a perfect size, don't be fool by the small number of ounces. The meal all together with their delicious loaf of bread was very filling. The Chateau potato, however, I could do without. My boyfriend got the Caesar salad, a 16 oz. Rib Eye (for an additional $10) with the signature crab cake with sauteed mushrooms for the side and strawberry cheesecake for dessert. It was such a huge slab of meat cooked to perfection and very tender. You can actually order any steak choice for the power couple special, it's just an additional to the individual $50. We also order the Lobster Mac and Cheese because there's no way I would go to a restaurant and not order mac and cheese. One of the better tasting mac and cheese and with REAL lobster pieces? How much better can it get?   Service was more than attentive. We had three people serving us our sides at once. It... was... weird. I'm not used to having a server bring me my sides and then scooping some onto my plate before settling it down on the table. There was a server just to refill our water, another to clear our tables, another to bring us food, another to give us more bread, and our assigned server who comes around and asks if everything's good. SO MANY SERVERS! It was overwhelming. The boyfriend and I had a great meal.   We self parked in the parking lot though they have valet. The valet just moves your car to a parking spot at the convenient lot right in front of the restaurant. No point in really doing valet, in my opinion. The restaurant does get full during dinner time so reservation is highly suggested!",

I also ordered the recommended VIP (vodka in fresh pineapple) martini and I enjoyed it, but felt a little lemon sweet would have helped the taste, which was on the sweet side.  We split a chopped salad and baked potato and again, way to much left over food but still had room for the highly recommended lemon cake which I am glad we tried. The buttercream frosting was the best part of the dessert.  coffee is good here too.  Service was just as nice as at the Mastro's Ocean Club. Prices were the same, but they did offer a Sunday dinner special for 2 at $99 which was a nice option.

I have tried many other places but Del Frisco's set a high bar and other places like The Golden Steer and Mastros pale in comparison. And it's not just for steak. The fish is superb as well. Do yourself a favor and try the best!",

The steaks and lobster tails are perfection every time I go as well.   The overall experience from the bread at the beginning of the meal to the dessert at the end is an absolute 10/10. If your a local or a visitor looking for a steakhouse this is without question the one to come too.",

When I made the reservation I mentioned that we were celebrating is birthday. When we arrived and gave my name they immediately acknowledge it and wished him a happy birthday. I had asked for a nice table that was in a busier room (my boyfriend likes to be in the action) and that was also arranged. When we got to the tnle there was a nice birthday card that was signed by most of the staff. (Nice touch)   We were given water right away and our drink order was taken. Anyone who interacted with us wished him a Happy Birthday, like everyone in the restaurant had been breifed. Then our waiter came over....Jason was absolutely AMAZING!!! Friendly, Energetic, informative, funny, and timely! He had mentioned that he had only been working there for a few months but knew so much that you would have thought he was there for years. We had noticed that he had not signed the birthday card so he graciously signed it making a joke that it wasn't a complete birthday card until it had his signature in it. My boyfriend and I just LOVED him! When our meal was over Jason brought a large slice of their lemon cake with a candle in it and said it was complimentary to help celebrate the birthday.   Other than the amazing food and the wonderful service here is the reason I will be returning! A week after we had dined there I got 2 cards in the mail from Del Frisco's. One was a cards was from the manager saying thank you with his business card and a comlimentary appetizer. The other, a little thicker, was a card from Jason with $12.00 in it saying that he had accidently charged me for the slice of lemon cake and wanted to pay me back! I don't know ANY restaurants or ANYONE for that matter that does this!!!! I was floored. Thank you for making my boyfriends birthday so special and making me feel like I was valued.  I can't wait to return and we will see you soon!!  Stephanie",

I went for my birthday and sat at the bar way longer to just get a steak than anyplace I have been. Finally the bar tender said let me go check, I don't know what's taking so long. Finally he came out with a steak and said if you want something done you have to do it yourself. Not only did it take long but the steak was raw not medium. The manager offered to buy dessert. I didn't go for dessert  I wanted a meal. I was also prepared to spend over $500 dollars of gift cards. This place is now off of my list for high end steak restaurants. I will not only tell others on this forum but everywhere else.",

They sat us in one of the smaller rooms which was nice because it was a little more intimate.  Our server, Shawn was very knowledgeable, friendly and funny and helped us understand the menu.  We ordered the ahi and wedge salad to share.  I ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon, my man ordered the crab cakes.  Shawn said the sides were huge so we decided to share the asparagus as well.  First of all, the bread they serve is friggin awesome!  If it is not made fresh there I would be surprised.  However, sharing was probably not the best move.  Although the ahi was perfectly sized for 2 people as was the wedge salad, with the blue cheese crumbles and bacon, the entrees were smaller than expected. My steak was great, but the asparagus was slightly burnt and my boyfriend was still hungry after the crab cakes even though he asked for and ate a 2nd loaf of the bread!  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  Again, I could've eaten it by myself but allowed him a couple of bites!  We ended up stopping at Smith's to buy some Ben and Jerrys!  So the service and atmosphere is great, portions could be bigger for the price.",

To our surprise we were seated immediately.  Service was terrific.  Several staff members checked on us and wished me a happy birthday.  Everything on the menu looked so good we ordered way more food then we could eat.  We started with crab cake, seafood soup and Caesar salad.  For mains we got shrimp scampi and bone-in rib eye.  Lobster mac and cheese, chateau potatoes and onion rings were the sides.  Our food was excellent.  I would pass on the seafood soup and onion rings next time though.  Nothing wrong with them, just personal preference.  We finished the meal with a complimentary slice of their famous lemon cake and a card signed by the staff.  A few days later we got a thank you card in the mail from our server.  That was a first for me.  I'm sure they make her do it but it was still a nice touch.  Overall, Del's is a solid choice for an off strip steakhouse.  Oh and at Thanksgiving you order to-go side dishes!",

Throw back a few single malts, enjoy a slab of prime beef and shoot the s#*t as only guys can.  Although a small chain, Del Frisco beef falls above that of Morton's and Ruth's Chris in quality and taste but below that of the celebrated steakhouses of the Strip.    Standard steakhouse starters.  No strong standouts.  No complaints either.   Steaks are steaks.  USDA prime.  Standard cuts.  Decent aging.  Well trimmed.  Juicy, beefy and properly cooked.  Surprisingly, top props go to the lamb.  The double cut lamb chop has a very pronounced lamb flavor.  Lamby?  It's sweet and gamy at the same time.  Cooked with the perfect sear.  Sorry Mary, your little lamb was delicious!  The veal porterhouse is worth a try.  Tender with the unexpected pronounced flavor of beef.  This is definitely not produced from penned up calves but rather those that had the chance to roam free (see, no reason to hate me).  Steakhouse standard sides.  Sharing portions.  No complaints.  Good wine list focusing on US vintners.  Below strip prices.  Recommended for the Vegas local wanting to avoid the Strip.  Visitors, this is just a quality steakhouse.  Pay for the glitz, be a baller,  and live the \"Vegas fantasy\".",

    "text": "Our group of seven made reservations for Del Frisco's on a Saturday night around 9pm.  We arrived and were promptly seated in a semi-private room (which was great as we were a bit loud and noisy).  The service above all else was impeccable - more to that later.  We had heard so much about the vodka infused pineapple and so many of us ordered it.  My feeling was that it was delicious, but too tropical fruity for a steak dinner.  Okay for the lounge chair by the pool, but too tangy and sweet for a rich steak.  Below is my review of our meal: 1) sliced tomatoes and onions..  meh, I've had better, I liked that there was blue cheese crumble on the tomatoes and onions.  But there were only 3-4 tomato slices and the tomatoes tasted like styrofoam - absolutely no tomato-flavor. 2) shanghai fried calamari- wha?  don't understand the introduction of an Asian flavor into this otherwise, traditional steak house menu.  The soy-based, overly sweet sauce was not a good appetizer for the meal 3) asparagus - good, but how do you go wrong with asparagus cooked in butter? 4) potatoes au gratin - not done well at all.  First the potatoes were not hot, just mildy warm.  Second there was no nice, broiled \"crust\" on the gratin.  It was kinda just mushy, and the potatoes were cut in chunks and not sliced. BE WARNED, there is BACON. 5) creamed spinach - not bad, but again how can you go wrong with mushed up spinach and cream.  Again, there is BACON in this dish. 6) wedge of lettuce - blue cheese dressing is good, I think the blue cheese could have been stronger, but good 7) Porterhouse - good but definitely not \"melt-in-your-mouth\" great as I have had at other steak restaurants (Peter Luger's, even Ruth Chris). Lacked a crust to the meat, which I usually look forward to.   8) RibEye - again, good, but was a bit salty for some.  9) Lemon Cake - meh, nothing to write home about 10) Melted Chocolate Cake (or something like it) with ice cream - again, nothing special, and the ice cream and a weird, tangy flavor 11) coffee - WEAK, and tepid.  THe manager came back and refilled our cups, but still it barely tasted like coffee.  If you like airplane coffee, it might suffice..  Service overall is FANTASTIC.  At one point, when they served the steak, we had 6 people serving our table, helping us cut the meat, serve the appetizers, etc.  The manager was also very gracious, when we mentioned that people in our party did not eat pork and was disappointed in the gratin and creamed spinach.  She eventually removed those appetizers off our bill and comped us free coffee and dessert!  So all in all, food was meh, service was fantastic.",

All come together at Del Frisco's , which I now make an effort to visit each time I am in Vegas. The New York strip is better than Mortons, Flemings, or Ruth Chris.  Outstanding sides that are easily shared, and service that follows up with you in a personable way. The only drawback is that their wine prices are a bit upmarket, sometimes 3x over retail, plus they won' t let you bring wine in.  That said, I will always hit this place up over the all of the nouveau, johnny come lately places that set shop up every few months.",

One member of our group had the rib-eye also medium rare. He said he was full after about half of the steak but by the end of the meal the whole thing had been eaten. When asked about where it all went, he told us that it was so good he just couldn't stop himself. The fourth member of our group had the lamb chops. They were fantastic, perfectly cooked and so wonderful that the only thing left was the bones that the chops were on. Sides were flavorful, dessert was just right. The table split a piece of their fabulous lemon cake. Perfect balance of sweet and tart with a lightness to the cake itself that capped a wonderful meal. The staff was attentive, friendly and solicitous. Water glasses were constantly refilled but you never felt the hovering presence of wait staff. When we needed something, there was always somebody at the ready. Recommended without reservations.",

    "text": "If I could give this restaurant a sixth star, I would in a second. Del Frisco's has to be one of the best steak houses (if not the best) that I've been to.   Let's get down to business: the quality of the meat is second to none. My friends ordered a filet mignon (warm red throughout) and the 16 oz. rib-eye. The filet was very tender and cooked exactly as described. I had a bite of the rib-eye and it was perfectly seasoned and possibly more tender than the filet. For my entree, I ordered the \"tomahawk\" cut, which consists of a 24 oz. ribeye attached to a fourteen inch bone. According to the waiter, during the aging process (a 2-week dry aging followed by a 2-week wet aging) the bone marrow from the 14 incher seeps into the meat to add an extraordinary amount of flavor. I would have to agree that this aging process succeeds in its purpose. This tomahawk cut (so named because the actual piece of meat + bone looks straight from last of the mohicans) is the best piece of steak I have ever consumed. If you can shell out $90 for this, DO IT...you won't be disappointed.   As for other food to accompany the gigantic tomahawk, we had a Caesar salad, fried oysters, and mushrooms to go with the steak. For dessert we had the cinnamon creme brulee. All very good.   As many people mentioned before, the service is impeccable. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and could cite every detail of each cut without any UHH's. Straight memorized! They paced the meal well and attended our every need.   The decor and atmosphere had the feel of an Italian social club for the elite yet the comfort of your best friend's house. Right when I walked in, I caught the scent of a light woody aroma (probably due to the cigars). We were seated before our reservation time and brought to a semi-private dining area adjacent to the cigar room. There was only one other party in the room, so we felt that we owned the room. Complete with two large screen LCDs showing Sportscenter, we felt absolutely welcome and comfortable.   I need to go back....soon! I need a Del Frisco in San Francisco.",

The sommelier gave us a great wine choice, and our server Anna was friendly and attentive. I am pretty jaded by Vegas dining, where you find a lot of pretty good food for astronomical prices. Del Frisco's was a splurge that was worth the price.",

Doesn't quite match the ambiance of a Maestros or Taylor's, but the food and service more than makes up for any \"style\" shortcomings it may have.  I love steak.  If YOU love steak and you're in Vegas, Del Frisco's will satiate those meat cravings you'll inevitably get after a 3 hour session at the craps table.  Yo elleven and get your steak on!!!",

    "text": "Great place for a Great Porterhouse. When in season one of the best places for Stone Crab claws. And you must try their bread and Lemon cake both, which are very addictive. However I have to give this restaurant 4 stars because they have no booths and the rooms can be noisy and a little crowded due to a choppy layout and a main dining room with a full bar. This is especially bothersome when you are trying to relax and unwind.  Definitely one of the best steak houses in Las Vegas but they need to change the layout and get some booths to give it a 5 star rating.",

While, it was very good, it tasted like a great steak but not too impressve for the \"Kobe\" classification.   There were pieces of the cut that were melt in your mouth, Matrix-scene, tender, but for the most part, it was just a very good steak.  The sides are all ordered separately and they were all very very good too - mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and spinach.  Service was fantastic and our waitress was very attentive and entertaining.  It's located just off the strip.  I highly recommend this place for Las Vegas steaks.",

I had to change the reservation because we didn't know what time we would be finished bowling.  When I called, it was no problem at call changing the reservation.  The meal was excellent.  I would have to say that it is far better that Ruth Chris's and I don't think Ruth Chris is bad.  It is on the pricey side though.  When we went, we were eating our meal during closing time but they did not rush us out.  We didn't even know that they were closing for the night.  I felt bad asking about the James Bond table but they showed us the table and also the wine cellar.  If you are asking yourself \"What is the James Bond table\", it a table that pops up and has a bunch of wines with the different James Bond titles on the bottle.  When it pops up, it plays the James Bond theme music.  I was told that the table is over a million dollars.",

    "text": "If you want THE BEST RIBEYE and THE BEST SERVICE, come here.  A name like Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House better be hardcore/legit and man oh man is it!  It's hard to believe there is a steakhouse that is easily 2-3 notches above a Mastro's, Ruth's Chris, and Fleming's in terms of food taste/quality and service, but there is and the place is called Del Frisco's.    This place doesn't need any gimmicks to get you into the door (i.e. online discounts, club-like atmosphere, etc.).  This place is a True steakhouse with well trained staff that are on top of their game.  Our server was friendly, attentive, polite, and informative when it came to questions on the menu.    Came here for a friend's bday (party of 6) and everyone was blown away.  The steak knife was solid, heavy, and even had a Del Frisco's engraving on it.  That surely sets the stage for what is to come. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and it came out perfect, as a $49.95 medium rare ribeye should. The meat was surprisingly very tender and the seasoning was to perfection.  I'm not going to go on and on about the rest of my evening or talk about the sides.  No need to.  Get the bone-in ribeye and you will easily find yourself commenting with a 5 star post like mine next time you get onto Yelp.",

    "text": "I do not have a single complaint about this place. What a wonderful find!  Our concierge at the Bellagio very enthusiastically recommended Del Frisco's, saying it was her personal favorite place to get a good steak.  We requested a table outside because it was an uncommonly nice night out in Vegas. We were the only ones out there, and so we were a little concerned that we might get forgotten about. We couldn't have been more wrong.  Their philosophy on service here is commendable. We must have met every waiter, busser, and bartender in the restaurant--the entire wait staff makes it their responsibility to take care of the everyone's tables, regardless of whether they're \"theirs\". We never wanted for attention the entire meal and everyone was genuinely friendly and seemed happy to be working there.  We ordered the crab cakes, which one of our waiters said they were \"very proud of\". No breadcrumbs or other fillers that usually plague crab cakes, just honest-to-goodness delicious crab.   For dinner, I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the veal. Quality cuts, cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth succulent.  We were also recommended the Grand Marnier-infused strawberries over vanilla ice cream. Nice and light and the right amount of sweet after a heavy meal.  Finally, for you beer lovers, you MUST try the Kwak Belgian beer. Funny name, ridiculously satisfying and uniquely flavored beer.  We'll definitely be back next time we come through town. Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "This place is the bomb, for sure. I have been to the Del Friscos in Dallas but it's been a few years, so I thought I'd give the Vegas venue a shot. The restaurant is what you'd expect for an immaculate steakhouse - white linen tablecloths, friendly hosts / hostesses, a fantastic (albeit expensive) wine menu, live entertainment (piano player jazzy kind of a guy singer accompanied with an extremely well endowed bar fly girl dancing around the piano the whole night...ok that part wasn't necessarily \"elegant steak house\" material but it was fun to watch all the same). So on to the food. I had a very friendly waiter named David who was quite helpful. He was good enough to warn me that the side portions were \"family style\" and that it might be too much food to order 2 sides with my steak. Nice, most waiters would have simply scribbled down the order and ran to the kitchen.  I had a filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and the au gratin potatoes. It would have been nice if they offered smaller sides; I would have had asparagus but since the sides are huge I decided on only one. The steak did not disappoint. It was buttery soft, served similar to Ruth's Chris with a little butter on a hot plate (not nearly as much butter though, which in some ways is a positive). I had several bits of the steak without the peppercorn sauce to verify the taste of the beef. It was very nice, although it could have had slightly more beefiness to it. I realize this is dangerous territory since most gourmets would probably say that's exactly as it should be, but at this point I am comparing all steaks to Harriss' in San Francisco, and I'm happy to say (because I live within walking distance to Harriss') that I don't think this one was quite as good. As for the au gratin potatoes, they are pure heart stopping bliss in a nice hot dish. Cheesy, gooey, potatoey, baconey heaven in a bowl. Nice Southern cajun accent to the dish.  So, I'd definitely go to Del Friscos again because it certainly doesn't suck. I am still on the quest though for the better steak. Rumor has it that MIchael Minna is offering the only True Kobe steak in town (in Vegas that is). May have to investigate further. I think it's sad how Kobe beef is raised, similar to veal, but if you've ever had real Kobe you will never forget the experience and I may have to indulge once more.",

Since fellow yelpers raved about Del Friscos and the Howard Stern Show, on Sirius, always gets lunch or catering from them, I knew they would not disappoint.    Everything was perfect.  The ambiance, perfect.  The food, perfect.  The service, beyond perfect.    You walk in and the hostess is super nice.  You notice the decor is of dark wood and the lighting is perfectly dim.  The server greets you right away and makes you feel comfortable (unlike those other snooty restaurants in LA).  We informed her that it was our first time and she was more than happy to explain everything from the size of the cut to what Del Frisco's is known for.  We decided on the crab cakes, Porterhouse Steak and three sides, the corn, mashed potatoes with cheese, and another dish I can't remember with a bottle of wonderful merlot (which I found at Trader Joe's - YES!).  The crab cakes were heavenly.  Soooo yummy!  I enjoyed the steak very much...although I wished it would have been more pink (my hubby wanted it to be medium well, I wanted medium).  Considering it was medium well, it was still very tender and delicious.  My hubby would have picked up that huge bone and sucked on it till it was clean if we weren't inside a restaurant.  The sides were just okee....I think we ordered too much food to enjoy the sides...but the corn was good.  For desert, we ordered the chocolate souffle...yum!  I dreamed of it that night.  They compted the souffle since it was my hubby's birthday.  And, the didn't come in a huge group and sing (I hate that...so tacky).  Our bill, under $200.  Perfect.    A couple of days after returning from Vegas, we got a sweet thank you note from our waitress.  Wow, talk about 5 star service.    Would we return, definetly.  They should open one in Los Angeles.",

I ordered mine rare (why wouldn't you at a place like this??), and it came out perfectly cooked. Warm, red, but not still bleeding, tender, and full of flavor. It didn't cut like butter, but it couldn't have been much better.  I'm only giving four stars because of the appetizers. I was tricked into ordering what the waiter called the \"triple-double\", which was described as three pieces of shrimp per person, plus two additional appetizers. The waiter said he didn't know how much it would be, because it depends on how many people were in the group (9). Fair enough. But he didn't mention that the crab cakes were similarly priced (per person at the table). Just the shrimp alone was over $100, and appetizers altogether were about $200.  The shrimp was pretty standard, and definitely NOT worth it. The crab cakes were excellent, but again, I feel like we were deceived somewhat.  I would highly recommend Del Frisco's, but only for the steak. Save yourself some money and avoid the overpriced appetizers. Plus, the steak is more than enough food for most people.",

I was a bit disappointed and discouraged really from the moment we were sat in some testosterone infused wood paneled room with four flat screen TVs playing ESPN. WTF I thought I was at a steak house that was going to cost me upwards of 150$ per person. But my surroundings were very much collegiate Dennys. I lost my appetite. The wine list was enormous and lacking a sommelier. It was hard to find a wine under $100 and most were over $200. Ridiculous. They wet age their meat. I'm a fan of dry aging. The negatives just go on... Skip it. There are plenty of steak specials in town for $15 if you're looking for meat stick to that and use the difference of $150 on some nickel slots instead.",

I am so bored with Flemings, Donovan's, etc., and I was craving a fantastic steak, but not real optimistic given my experiences lately. My pessimism was quickly cast asunder. This place is fantastic. I can usually find SOMETHING to keep a place from perfection, but I cannot here. The dining experience was top notch - and you pay for it. More on that in a minute. My rib steak was cooked to perfection. A little more rare than what I would call medium rare, but I happen to like it a tad more rare anyway. The taste of the steak was nothing short of magical. I didn't add one speck of seasoning, it was great from the start. The asparagus was cooked al dente -- perfect. Everything was hot, the service (Priscilla) was impeccable. When the table of 18 next to us got their entrees, EIGHT waiters delivered their meals. I haven't seen that type of \"sweeping\" service since I was in Europe, and only rarely there. Price ? Yes. Alot. Not cheap. Think -- $28000 bottle of wine on the list. That'll give you an idea. When you decide you want to splurge and have an expensive night out, this is the place to drop the wad. No complaints. Like a Lamborghini - if you can afford it, It's worth it.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for dinner last night.  Our server was Ryan or Brian.  He was pretty good.  We sat on the patio which had a fan and mister so it was not too hot.  We arrived a few minutes before five but the hostesses said they don't seat anyone until five exactly so we had to wait a few minutes at the bar area.  The bartender greeted us and was friendly although we opted to not have cocktails.  Once seated I started with a Caesar salad.  It was whole romaine leaves in dressing and shreds of parmesean.  I really was craving lettuce so that was good, but I have to say the Caesar was truly disappointing.  It was a very bland dressing that I wasn't too fond of, and the croutons were okay but fairly lackluster.  So far I was not impressed and was worried because this place had such good recommendations from friends as well as on yelp.  After my salad my crab-cake dinner came out, and my boyfriends filet.  We also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese.  My crab-cakes came in a Cajun sauce and they were excellent.  I was relieved!  The sauce was creamy and the right amount of spicy, and the crab-cakes were not full of breading at all- they did have a bit of crunch to them via some vegetables which I did really enjoy.  I had been craving and missing crab-cakes being from Baltimore so these definitely made me happy!  The lobster mac and cheese my boyfriend said was the best we have had.  I tried my boyfriends filet but since it was medium-well I was disgusted though he seemed to enjoy it.  I let the waiter know we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday so we would definitely like to see the dessert menu no matter what my boyfriend said.  The waiter said \"ok\" and then minutes later brought out a giant piece of lemon cake with a candle in it.  That was so sweet of the waiter- we were not even asking for a free dessert and he did that without us knowing.  The cake was moist with a lemon-curd filling on each layer and a very good frosting on the outside.  The frosting was just the right amount of sugary that I like and was thinly on the cake.  I loved it!  All in all I don't know that I would go back but I am happy that I went there and tried it!",

We had the chateau potatoes and asparagus. The potatoes were good, traditional mash fare. The asparagus wasn't all the great - pretty stringy and could only chew half the stalk. They would do better to get thinner asparagus. Overall a very yummy, luxurious steak place.   The cinnamon creme brulee and cheesecake were both delicious. They were new takes on traditional sweets. The cheesecake isn't baked so it comes very light and fluffy - dare I say it was the best original style cheesecake I've ever had [can't say best cheesecake ever, because cheesecake with chocolate in it might still win me over more].",

We had the 32 oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye, and I have to say, it was a heavenly cut of beef.  So delicious!  Our sides were the lobster Mac and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and their version of mashed potatoes (chateau potatoes).  My fave was the lobster Mac and cheese.  Actually, it became my fave side dish, ever!  From any of the restaurant side dishes I've ever had. My husband loved the chateau potatoes.    The lemon cake was superb!!  I'm craving that nowww!",

The steaks were always juicy and melt in your mouth (we always get the bone in ribeye). The steaks are similar to Ruth's Chris' but tasted a little better. Their lobster mac and cheese was only ok--not very memorable to me. Their sesame bread was delicious. We always go to town on those bread with butter. Even asked for seconds--and they never mind. Service is top notch here.   Definitely check this place out if you're a steak lover! My BF and I always try to fit this place on our itinerary whenever we're in Vegas!",

Once for dinner and everything was delicious and twice for their happy hour eating by the bar. The special Pinot and house pineapple vodka cocktail is so good as well as their prawn dish, burgers and sliders. My mouth is watering remembering how good they were and at happy hour with a brilliant piece tag. Love that their burgers also come with fries cheaper than ordering fries on their own at happy hour. Get there early for larger groups as sometimes there's a wait.  My only criticism is the piano guy can be pretty loud during this time though he does play good tunes.  Love the free del fresco golf tees and Jellybeans. If we ever go back to Vegas we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "The options were Del Frisco's or Ramsay's Steak @ Paris.  I chose Del Frisco because of its $99 Power Couple deal.  I opentabled the restaurant for dinner to save time.  We self-parked but the valet guy ran to the door and opened it for us.    $99 Power Couple is only for Sunday.  We ordered caesar salad, del salad, filet, crabcake, sauteed mushroom, chateau potato, chocolate mousse and bread pudding.  Sesame bread: complimentary hot bread and butter.  Warning: do not eat too much of these!!!  You will be full.  I ate 2 slices of bread because they were yum but occupied a portion of my stomach =(  Caesar salad:  One of the freshest caesar salads I've ever had. Del salad: Served with 2 stripes of bacon on top, this is better than caesar salad.  Filet: The medium rare is rare and the medium is medium rare.  The worker asked us to cut the filet to make sure it is cooked just the way we liked it.   We sent it back to the kitchen because they seemed to be undercooked for our liking.  The filet is superb!!  Ruth Chris got nothing on Del Frisco.   Crabcakes: very lumpy but I don't really care for it.  Sauteed mushroom:  juicy and perfectly cooked but I don't care for it either. Chateau potato: it's just okay...I've had better.  I was so full that I didn't even finish my steak...what a waste!!!  I was so tempted to doggy-bag my steak leftover and eat it in my room.  Bread pudding: crispy on the outside with ice cream, caramel drizzle and mint leaf on top.  I don't really like it. Chocolate mousse: the most creative design with fork and spoon shadows from cocoa powder.  I like this chocolate mousse better than the bread pudding.  My waiter, Matt (?), is super funny.  How many people worked there that night?  We have the hostess, waiter,  the person who brought the salad, busboy, steak delivery boy, 2 side dishes workers, the girl who picked up empty bottle, napkin folder girl, the guy who gave me direction to the restroom....all different people.    4 stars!!  I am a fan of its delicious steak.  Del Frisco is yummylicious!!",

Couldn't resist the 16 oz portion Rib Eye No bone cooked perfectly at medium rare.   Accompanied with Roasted Brussels Sprouts with bacon, Sauteed Mushrooms and three butters.  Tarragon Butter, Bone Marrow Butter and Truffle Butter which was amazing.  Finished with their 5 Layer Lemon Cake.  Voila that's a dinner fit for a king I'd say.

    "text": "The boyfriend is going to kill me when he reads this review, because he loved the dinner and he spent a lot of money on it, but I was overly unimpressed.  We started off with the special chopped salad. I thought this was rather good, but it was so drenched in dressing that I could barely distinguish the different ingredients. I tasted bacon, and I felt the lettuce, but that's about it.   I forgot, the table bread is forgettable. Yes, it's soft, and covered in sesame seeds, but there was nothing special about it, besides the fact that it was a giant piece you had to break by hand and it left seeds all over the table. I LOVED the whipped butter, however. It was fluffy and salty, overall perfect, and I could spread this on anything and everything.  We ordered the bone in ribeye to share, since we had a large lunch. When it came to the table, some lady mangled it. She cut a 3-4 inch slit to ask us if it was cooked properly. We asked for medium rare, and I saw a lot of white-ish meat, but the bf gave his approval, so we took it. I wanted to let the steak sit for a minute, but the lady proceeded to cut it in all sorts of sloppy pieces.   It was a massacre. I've never seen anything like it before. She first tried to separate it from the bone. It was like she had never handled a piece of meat or a steak before. She was all over the place, and splatters of meat juice were shooting around the table. I don't know if any of it hit us or our clothes, but I saw stains appearing on the white tablecloth all around.   It took her forever to separate the bone from the meat. At one point I thought she was going to give up, because she just couldn't get the job done. The whole time, I was staring at the knife and wondering if she had grabbed the wrong one, or if it was dull or something. It was appalling.  Next, she cut the steak into pieces. She said she wanted us to have equal shares of each section of the steak. We had four pieces (one with the 3-4 inch slit in it), and then she decided one piece was bigger than the other, so she cut off a piece of it and threw it to the other portion. OMG. In the end, there were five pieces of mangled meat that were divided onto two plates. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  The meat looked bastardized after this.  When I bit into my portion, it was, to my surprise, tough. I'm not even exaggerating here. It was really tough for a $50 steak. I've cooked more tender rib eyes bought from Costco or from Omaha's online catalog. And it wasn't anything near medium rare. It was quite possibly medium, if not more done.   The flavor of the steak was good, but most of that was due to over salting. There is a lot of seasoning on this meat, so much so, that it was hard to actually taste the steak. I overly salt my steaks at home, but I'm not buying really expensive cuts. What I'm looking for in a pricey steak is texture, tenderness, and flavor (past the salt). I didn't get any of these three. If I had gotten this steak at Sizzler or at another, cheaper, restaurant, I'd be ecstatic, don't get me wrong. I am so critical, because this was supposed to be the best steak ever, and it fell short. By a lot.  The sides were hit and miss. I thought the mushrooms were nicely done and were bursting with flavor. I don't even like mushrooms, but I thought these were a nice pick. The special green beans were also good. The famed lobster mac and cheese that everyone raves over...wtf? The pieces of lobster were small, and although it was creamy, it was more milky than cheesy. It was extremely loose and runny in texture, and the predominant flavor was the taste of the breadcrumbs. Um, no. I had some the next morning (cold), and the congealed consistency was slightly more appetizing.  Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to look for steak elsewhere. In my humble opinion, it's not worth the price.",

We shared the Au gratin potatoes and asparagus. All very well prepared and delicious. Now for the bad part and the two star review. After we were seated the gentleman brought us bread and I noticed something on my hand. I thought it was a moth but it was a German cockroach. I have been in the pest control business for almost 40 years and know that almost all restaurants struggle with these issues. The guy asked if we wanted to move and I assured him it was ok probably just a coincidence. My wife saw it and freaked out a bit! I killed it. About halfway through the meal I saw another one crawling on the outside of the table cloth and another crawling towards another table!!!! Note to the manager call your provider immediately!!! You have a serious health issue at your restaurant, I wrote a note on my tab, I asked to speak with the manager and they said you were not available.i will not return or recommend your restaurant. I may even call the health department.",

I had the prime ribeye it was ok I was a little disappointed the meat was pretty rough and chewy. Not much flavor, so I guess that why they offer flavor butter.(make sure to get it)The potatoes au gratin  were delicious. My husband had the lobster Mac and cheese he said it was really good also he had the Chilean Seabass he said it was delicious.  So over all its a very nice restaurant very old school decor which is cool for Vegas. We recommend giving it a try I'd just order a different type of steak next time. It is very expensive so, maybe just a special occasion spot:)",

Lately my boyfriend and I have decided to sit at the bar because we enjoy the bartender Ron so much. If you ever get s chance to dine at the bar, Ron will definitely entertain you with good conversation. Now their bread and butter is some of the best bread I've ever had; I always get some to go lol. For starters the del salad is good but I am now hooked on their chopped salad, which is not on the menu. I love the fried oysters as well as the buffalo shrimp (bar menu). Crab cakes are like no other, you will absolutely LOVE. Ribeyes are always cooked to perfection and seasoned very well. Once they bring your steak out they ask you to cut it down the middle to make sure it's to your likings. I always order a strawberry daiquiri of a  VIP.",

I'd go back again just because she was awesome!   Food was so delicious. I'm not a big eater so I only ordered macaroni and cheese and it was the best Mac n cheese I've had! :)   I filled out a card at the restaurant and Maria sent a thank you card a couple weeks later thanking us for coming. I thought that was just so cool!   Great overall experience and I would definitely go back again and ask for Maria :)",

    "text": "We went on a Thursday night for date night.  The atmosphere is dark and intimate with live music playing lightly in the background.  The sommelier, while very helpful and tailored choices to our price range, kind of creepped up on us and never actually introduced herself to us.  She just stood over our shoulders and asked if we needed help.  It was an odd start, but after that she was friendly.  Foodwise, the crab cakes were delicious and I'd go again just to order those!  We split a 26 oz double eagle bone in ribeye.  For being a double eagle steak house, our steak was good (moist and juicy sealed with a light char) , but I've had better.  We also ordered the asparagus and lobster mac & cheese.  The sides portions are pretty big and we ended up with a lot leftover.  Although we had leftovers, we still made room for warm banana bread pudding with a healthy scoop of ice cream on top.  It was a wonderful warm/cold contrast to seal off the night.  The service was attentive and timely.  We did notice an error on our bill and pointed it out to our server.  Afterwards, the manager came over to apologize and advise us he took care of our dessert for the error.  It was definitely unexpected and confirmed their dedication to excellent customer service.  We had heard rumors of the famed James Bond wine table here, so we asked the hostesses on the way out.  They were really nice and showed us the book with the special hidden button to open up the table and let us look around.  Although you can't drink any of the wine, it's definitely a sight to see.  Del Frisco's gets my date night seal of approval.",

    "text": "We went here for my fiance's birthday and it was a really great meal/experience.  I felt like the waiters were overeager to please at times which could be awesome or could just get annoying.  For some reason I felt awkward with their attentiveness and rejected it (kinda shooed them away).  My fiance and I shared some couples special that involved crab cakes and filet mignon.  He is allergic to shellfish so we asked that the crab cakes be on a separate plate.  They forgot or whatever.  It wasn't a big deal and I moved them myself (and then they noticed and felt so bad).  I had the bread pudding.  I think I now have an obsession with bread pudding.  It was so rich/delicious/awesome.  Yummm.   At the end of the meal the waiter asked if we wanted cigars.  I am not sure if he meant to buy or for free - really odd.  We declined either way.    The steak was cooked (nearly) exactly as we ordered it and they have you cut into it to make sure.  I said something about it being a little pink and the waiter nearly forced me to send it back.  I had to force him to let it go.  It was really great and the sides we ordered (I recommend the mushrooms with some sort of garlic sauce as a side) were fab too.   So overall, the food was delicious. The waitstaff was happy to please.  The experience was positive and my fiance enjoyed his birthday meal.",

The burger was thick and tasty although I felt the bun is overly thick. The condiments were fresh and the potatoes that came with the burger were on the greasy side. I ended up half way through the burger and chucked half the bun and finished the burger with a fork and knife.  The bar has cougars and one was chatting my ear off. Don't get me wrong I like socializing but she was a distraction!  Stick with the steaks, lobster and crab cakes,  I've had better burgers elsewhere although the HH price was a bargain for $13.00 for two beers & burger before gratuity.   The bartenders here were both great..",

We also had the bone-in rib steak which was equally tender and rich in flavor. But the overwhelming favorite was the double lamb chops that was so so so tender and the flavor (not gamey) was full of seared fat and rich lamb flavor.  I had to share my chops with my family and got only a small bite size of heaven.  Gotta go back alone !!!  The lobster mac'n cheese did not have enough lobster flavor nor chunks of lobster meat???? The caesar salad was freshly made with excellent anchovies, citrus and parmesan flavor lightly tossed with extra light olive oil.  Love this place, great service but didn't like the fact that they put us near the kitchen especially when we spent over $600 for 4 people.....maybe that's where they put families with teenagers?????",

    "text": "Dined here on Saturday, 3/3/12 with my hubby.  I have to say what a wonderful dining experience we had here at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House!!!    We had a 7:30 PM dinner reservation and when we arrived we were immediately greeted by the hostess.  The place was packed and with people and it was quite loud and \"happy.\"  :)  We were seated in 10 minutes.  Service here was outstanding!  Our servers were very helpful and friendly and helped us choose some items off the menu.    The bread and butter they brought to the table was amazing!  Fresh, hot, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside.  We made the mistake of eating too much bread before dinner, but could not help ourselves as it was sooo good! :)  For starters we had the onion rings.  OMG!  They were HUGE!  MASSIVE!  More like onion \"bracelets\" than onion rings!  But man were they really tasty!  Best onion rings ever!!!  My hubby ordered their 14 oz lobster tail and I ordered one of their specialty steaks. For sides we had their lobster mac and cheese and chateau potatoes.  Everything was very rich and delicious!  The lobster was tender and juicy!  My steak was flavorful, tender and melted in my mouth.  Quite possibly the best steak I have ever eaten!    :)  The lobster mac and cheese was also very good and highly recommended as was the chateau potatoes.  Both were very rich, creamy, and cheesy!  Sinful I tell you!  For dessert, my husband ordered the creme brulee and I ordered their banana bread pudding.  The banana bread pudding was amazing!!!  It was served piping hot with vanilla ice cream and drizzled in caramel. I highly recommend it!  Pretty big too and could easily be shared between two people.    My hubby and I both really enjoyed Del Frisco's and highly recommend it if you are looking for an awesome steak house and wish to dine away from the crazy/busy Las Vegas Strip.   TIP:  Wear something loose or stretchy!  It's a whole lot of food!!!  :)  You will leave in a food induced coma!  :)",

    "text": "My heart sank as the hostess started to lead us away from the main section of the restaurant to a more secluded and far less appealing area.  But even though inside I was screaming for her to stop and take us to where the action was happening, sometimes even I get tired of being such a pain in the ass customer - so I decided to behave myself for once and quietly followed instead.  We were shown to what I assumed to be the couple's section, and as a result, my date pretty much ended up sitting facing the wall.  Not cool when you're expected to drop $200-$300 on a dinner for two.  But Valentine's day weekend had made me all forgiving and pathetic and shit so I held my tongue, and there we sat in a thoroughly uninspiring, lifeless wood paneled room, away from any kind of activity or anything remotely interesting.   Service was on the slow side.  Some guy who seemed to be the manager came and got our drinks orders first.  Then another person brought some bread and butter spread, but for the longest time our server was MIA.  When she eventually did get to us, she was very pleasant, and armed with good suggestions and helpful hints.  The food was great for the most part: Caesar salad appetizer was tasty with just the right balance of everything, but the shrimp appetizer was not my favourite.  For my main course I had the half filet mignon, half lobster dish which was perfect and I enjoyed every bite.   Sadly, due to where we sat, I have no solid idea what the restaurant actually looks like, nor what the atmosphere is like - we could have been anywhere really - so that was a bit disappointing.  I guess they think they are doing couples a favour putting them in a quiet spot so they can enjoy each other's company - but hey, I can do that at home - when I am out at a restaurant, especially for the first time, I actually want to experience the scene, not be shoved in a claustrophobic corner surrounded by dark walls!  But overall, due to the excellent food and (eventual) service, this was a positive dining experience.  My favourite part of the whole evening?  A completely unexpected James Bond related surprise: under lock and key, Del Frisco's houses a unique, one of a kind 007 themed wine collection, estimated at a cool $1,000,000 and pretty damned awesome!  Ask to see it if you're a fan.",

Del Frisco's 22oz may be smaller, but it definitely packs the punch with intense flavors, and the meat literally melted in my mouth.  -Rd 2-  Mastro's take a slight edge when trainers got involved.

It's an easy cab ride from many strip hotels, especially those on the east side of Las Vegas Boulevard because it's a straight shot down Paradise Road.    We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation on a Saturday night and were seated promptly upon arrival.    Our server did a great job of walking us the menu and off-the-menu offerings and making recommendations, which later proved to be spot on.    Our server and the other members of the wait staff did a great job from start to finish.  The service was friendly, professional, and attentive but never intrusive or pretentious. The meal was well paced.     My buddy and I each ordered the 10 Oz bone-in-fillet, seafood paring, salads, and sides, all preceded by the recommended Calamari appetizer.    The Calamari appetizer was terrific.    The crab cake seafood pairing was excellent.    The sides (mushrooms and creamed spinach) were very good.    My fillet was perfection.    Sadly, after polishing off the Calamari, the salads, the steaks, the seafood, the sides, all washed down by cocktails, neither me or my buddy had room for dessert.     I will save room next time for the Lemon Cake.",

    "text": "We Came here for steak dinner for a bachelor party.  We read some decent reviews about this.  Food:  Started with the tuna tartare and the seafood soup.  The soup was delicious however a bit too much pepper seasoned on it.  The tuna tartare was pretty decent with great seasoning and it came with great toasts.  My friend end up ordering the 8z  Filet,  I ordered the Osobuco veal shank. It was decently marinated. However, the Pasta that came with it was completely dry and stuck together.  It was not edible at all.  My friend's filet was cooked perfectly to do medium rare and seasoned well.   We also ordered sauteed spinach, broccoli and sweet potatoes.  They told us was a family size.  But those portions were NOT family size. Barely enough for 2 people.   For the pricing of the sides,  those portion were Not worthy.  But the sides were cooked very well.  Overall, the food was pretty good. But they seem to miss out on some details.  3.5/5  Service: This Waiter was like a car dealer,  trying to sell every dish that you had questions for.  He was very knowledgeable.   The water boy were attentive and refilled our water consistently. The main waiter kept checking in us to see how we were doing.    It was very good consistence service during a pack dinner time.   4/5  Atmosphere:  When I walked in, It smelt like sewer smell.  It almost ruined my appetite.  However the place is very big and split up into sectors.  I like the spacing of the tables to allow people to walk and you cannot hear other table conversation.  It was decorated very well.   3.5/5    Overall, I will round it up to give it a 4 due to the consistency of the service and most of the dishes came out to be great.",

Del Frisco's is the finest steakhouse I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.  This place is head and shoulders above the other pretenders.  If those other steakhouses even dream about competing they better wake up and apologize.  Any fan of the competition has never eaten here.  That's it.  End of story.  I never visit a city with a Del Frisco's without stopping by.  I have converted many non-believers to the mantra that this is the best steak and restaurant experience they have ever had.  Treat yourself!",

Medium with a pink inside...not bloody.  Perfection in taste with the right char on the outside and flavors bursting from everywhere.  Hands down, this is the place to get steak.  We just caught the end of stone crab season.  Lots of meat in those claws and we ordered the large, not the jumbo.  Lemon cake was absolutely amazing and moist.  I wasn't much of a fan of the lemon cake but after that, I most definitely am.  What made our dining experience cool was the amazing service Brian gave us, as well as the manager, Amanda, stopping by to greet and chat. Amanda and Brian were warm and friendly, as well as professional.  The staff and food make the place what it is.  We were there to celebrate our anniversary as well as babymoon, and they made it special for us.  There are locals hanging out at the bar and enjoying happy hour.  Somehow, the place doesn't seem as stuffy, but do go in there dressed somewhat decently .   This is now my wife's and my top place to get steak.",

We made a reservation for 5:30 as we had guests coming to town later.  When we arrived we were the only food guests in the room.  The bar however was completely full and they had a pianist in the bar which was kind of nice.  The background nose was kind of loud and I am not sure why they didn't seat us in on of the other rooms with less noise.  The service was very good.  We started with the Carpaccio and the crab cakes and they were both very good.  The crab cake was delicious.  I had the braised short rib which was served over mashed potatoes. delicious!  My wife had the bone in filet and she said it was the best tasting filet that she can remember having.  For our sides we had the lobster mac and cheese, Asparagus with almonds and Au Gratin Potatoes. The mac and cheese was awesome, the asparagus was not prepared professionally as they were large stalks with good flavor but very thick skin which should have been shaved off on the lower extremities before serving and the Au Gratin was very good.  We have the butter cake with ice cream for desert and that was also very good.  The signed birthday card was nice but I forgot it on the table.  All in all this was very good but enough flaws that I could not muster that extra star.",

It started with a complimentary shot (it was my birthday) of their house specialty VIP Martini which was mandarin vodka soaking in fresh pineapple - Yummy! I had the $49 house special which includes Salad, Side & Steak.  I upgraded my steak to a bone in fillet and it was amazing.  This place specializes in bone in cuts of meat and i recommend that is what you order. The mac-n-cheese is a must order and its a huge portion (easily feeds 3-4) The mashed taters are also very large in portion. Plan on spending some time here - They want you to stay relax and enjoy. Plan on spending some $$$ but its well worth it.",

And I have been to quite a few fine restaurants all over the world and I am pleased to report that the service here is among the best. All of our needs are catered to but not in an annoying way. The timing was impeccable the attention to detail was meticulous and professional and the service was a large part of the overall experience. OK on to the food. I ordered the pineapple infused martini. Again ,outstanding..a subtle taste of vodka and a lovely aroma and taste of pineapple.This was a well made drink. Very good balance. We split a chopped salad,excellent. My guest ordered the three filet steaks with three separate toppings combo. One with bearnaise,one with hollandaise and I believe it was spinach and the last had a scallop and a shrimp on top.This is a great selection as it gives you a chance to sample three different types of flavors.I had the double cut lamb chops.They came with a pomegranate infused mint sauce that was one of the best I have ever had.Again great subtlety to the sauce,complimented the lamb to perfection. We ordered the mashed potatoes and the asparagus on the side. for dessert we had the creme brulee,again this was among the finest versions I have ever tasted. From the moment we arrived to the second we left we felt as if we had been invited to a vip experience. From the welcome to the service to the meal,this was outstanding from top to bottom.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of 9 for my Mother-in-law's birthday. Had a reservation and were seated as soon as everyone was there.  The table didn't drink much, but the drinks we had were all good and well made.  Strong wine list, too, as expected with a good steak house.  Sides are big enough for 4 or more people each and they're all good. Had the Asparagus, mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes. All delicious.   Although I don't usually review them here, I'm a bit of a steakhouse junkie. My personal test is the bone-in ribeye, medium rare, no extra crap on top to hide deficiencies.  Only rarely am I disappointed at higher end places. My steak came out  cooked perfectly. Well seasoned with salt and pepper and butter.  Oddly, once I got beyond the outer portions, I noticed I was chewing too much. Not normally an issue with a good ribeye. However, as I took a better look I realized this particular ribeye had no marbling. Not just less than normal, it was like the cow ran marathons or something. Just no fat to be found. Fat marbling, as you hopefully know, in addition to helping to hasten heart attacks, makes the meat tender. Like you could eat it with a spoon tender. Not this one. It was easily the leanest ribeye I've ever seen, which is why my jaw was getting such a hard workout. I know...clearly a 1st world problem. But when you pay this much for a steak you expect the best, and I just didn't get it with this one.  Had the butter cake for dessert. Full disclosure-we had it to compare it to the amazing one at Mastro's.  It was delicious and served with pecan ice cream.  As this was only my first time at this location, I'll give them a pass for the lean meat. The flavor of the meat was excellent and everything else we ate was tasty.  But if I start reading that other people have the same issue, I'll have to switch to a different protein or another steakhouse.",

    "text": "As a person who does not eat steak, I usually roll my eyes when someone suggests a steak place for dinner because I assume that there will be very little for me to eat on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the menu at Del Frisco's because of the number of fish dishes available. We started with the Crab Cakes (the extra star to make this resto a 5 on my list) and the meal stayed fantastic. I opted for their Ahi Tuna, which was perfectly cooked. Add to that the medley of yummy sides (the lobster mash was excellent, as were the sauteed mushrooms), and an extensive wine list, and, well, it really can't get better.... until you hit their desserts.  I am generally not a dessert person (as I prefer to calorie spend on salty foods).  But, when someone at the table insisted that I try a bite of their lemon cake, I was blown away!!  Absolute DELICIOUSNESS.  :)  Fair warning: this cake is crack... once you take one bite, you will have to take many more so calorie spend (if you do) wisely.   And, last but not least, the servers.  Service was spectacular.  My water (or, more importantly, wine) glass was never less than full and if a deceptive side (I think it was their creamed spinach that had bacon in it) came to the table, they were quick throughout the meal to point out so that I knew to stay away.   It's pretty rare when a non-steak eater gives a steak resto 5 stars. And, judging from the reactions at our table of those that opted for red meat, it's clear that Del Frisco's really has something for everyone!",

Location:   Nice ambiance, diverse, piano-bar feel Total incl gratuity:   $163.00  This place did not disappoint.  The service was very friendly; our waitress very attentive and very honest.  She made some fantastic recommendations of what to order and what went well with what.  The steak was very good; it definitely hit the spot and gave me the long awaited steak fix I was looking for.  They season the meat very well and it is cooked exactly how they describe.  Medium is a red center with hot pink sides.  It was delish.  I thought the ribeye was an excellent choice - tender and succulent.  It wasn't quite melt-in-your-mouth but nonetheless, it was still good.  We chose some fantastic sides...the creamed spinach with bacon bits was creamed heaven.   I enjoyed it very much.  If you like a hint of spice, request some tabasco sauce and sprinkle in into the spinach.  I find you can't go wrong with mushrooms - they always go well with steak.  And of course the potatoes au gratin.  They were extra cheesy and good though I definitely could feel the calories circulating into my body...  Overall, an excellent dining experience!  Great place for steak off of the strip.",

    "text": "Although I ate here a few months ago, I have to say this restaurant serves the best bone-in rib-eye steak I have ever tasted and I am a total steak lover.  I ordered the bone-in prime rib-eye steak (cooked medium rare) and it was extremely juicy and tasty! The juices from the steak were so good, I had to get extra bread to soak up every last bit of the flavor from the steak.   When discussing how the steaks were prepared with our waiter, I was surprised to heard that the steaks were wet aged. From researching different methods for aging prime steaks, I was always under the impression that dry aging was superior to the wet aging process because dry aging was supposed to produce a more flavorful cut of meat because the moisture was removed from the meat resulting in a more concentrated flavor. However, Del Frisco's ribeye steak has defied this myth and made me a believer in the wet aging process. Although I do enjoy a good dry-age steak like from Envy (in Las Vegas), the wet age steak prepared at Del Frisco had an extremely flavorful and juicy steak that I found to be the best ribeye steak I have every tasted.   With my frequent trips to Vegas, I used to like to try out a new steak house for each trip. Now, my future Vegas trips will alway include a visit to Del Frisco's!",

The Bartender was really friendly and mixed me an excellent Gin & Tonic,   We were seated promptly and our Waitress Pam was so warm and friendly that we felt very welcome.   My Lettuce Wedge starter was very Good and my wife's Shrimp cocktail equally tasty.   Our Steaks came and the waiter immediatly cut into the middle and shone a torch onto them to ensure that they were cooked perfectly (they were). The 3 Side dishes (Mashed potatoes, Sauted onions, Mixed Vegetables) we had ordered were so enormous that we couldn't finish them.   We had absolutely no room for dessert but they did look delicious.   The combination of fabulous food and great service made this visit a very happy one. Highly recommended.",

Our server and his team were very attentive. We started with the bacon appetizer, holy pig, it was ginormous and absolutely delicious! It had a black pepper crust but the sauce was a little sweet so the balance was very nice. Next we shared the wedge salad, it was good but the blue cheese was a little more tangy then we normally like. I'd probably try a different salad next time. For dinner I ordered the special, trio of filet medallions. Three 4 oz filets, one with baked brie, one with crab/asparagus/bernaise, one with truffle butter and shrimp. It was $65 and worth every dollar. My husband had the ribeye and baked potato. Since it was our anniversary they brought out a complementary slice of lemon cake. The best lemon cake we've ever had!  I can't really think of anything negative about our experience tonight. I definitely have my eye on a few things I'd like to try next time but I'll order that trio again for sure!",

    "text": "Waited way past our reservation but they hooked our group up with free drinks and an amazing room so that made up for it fantastically. Service was amazing.  Crab cakes are mind blowing. Lobster mashed potatoes, also mind blowing. Mushrooms were great. Beer and wine selection were awesome.   The 3 stars is because my steak was WAY over cooked. I ordered the prime, dry ribeye medium rare and it came medium well. The really strange thing is that the EXACT same thing happened to me at Del Friscos in New York around 3 months ago. Since this was the second time it happened at another Del Friscos clear across the country I thought maybe that's just how they cook their medium-rare steaks, way over done lol. I know it sounds dumb, but what are the freaking chances. But after powering through 1/3 of my dry steak with almost no pink in the middle I tried my buddy's (he ordered the exact same steak) and his was amazing. I know we ordered them exactly the same because I ordered mine and then he literally said \"I'll have the same steak, cooked the same way.\" Lol Mine was toasted, his was perfect.   I just don't understand how a steakhouse can over-cook one of their best quality steaks. You're a freaking steakhouse. After trying my buddy's I asked the server to look at my steak and tell me what he would call it. He paused for a second and said, \"Medium rare when it came out, but we serve on a very hot plate and it continues to cook a little.\" Lmao, but my buddy's, which was supposed to be exactly the same was dramatically different. It was a little annoying that he tried to hide the mistake but I was buzzed and didn't want to make a big deal in front of my guests so I just smiled and let them trash the rest of my steak.   So anyway, that's too many ruined steaks for me. That will probably be the last time I dine at a Del Friscos.",

    "text": "Let's get right to it.  I made a reservation over a month in advance for my mans 40th and we were sat at a table that was located directly in front of the kitchen door so every waiter, bus person & manager could walk by us all evening long. This wasn't pleasant and insanely noisy with all the plates of food going by over our heads.   As the restaurant filled up quickly on a Sat night we decided to order some drinks to help the unfortunate seating location. The VIP (SVEDKA Clementine & pineapple) was fantastic, one of the smoothest drinks I've ever had and my man enjoyed his Bacon & Barrel (Bacon-washed Bacardi 8, maple syrup & angostura).   The house sesame French bread was toasty & fresh served with soft butter.   The classic caesar salad was good with croutons made from the house bread but Del's salad was disappointing. Mixed greens just like from your local grocery store with a couple tomatoes and some shaved carrots. The goddess dressing was bland and the only thing good about this salad was the bacon on top. I have to admit that the caramelized bacon was really great.  The shrimp cocktail was the best thing we tasted that evening and I really enjoyed the unique way it was plated. The shrimp were meaty, large and fresh.   So now to the star of the show, the 24 oz prime porterhouse with truffle butter. By the looks of it...it's so beautiful! We ordered a medium steak as we always do and we were served raw steak. Not even a hint of pink but just straight up red inside. I told the lady cutting it up that the meat was raw after she cut me a portion from the right of the bone and of the left. She took my two pieces back and told us she'd be back with all of it in a few mins. A manager came by shortly after and apologized and said they would send over another lobster mac & cheese so everything was warm when our meat came back out. None of this was a big deal as shit happens but a few mins later the steak was brought back to us and one of the pieces that she cut for me was MIA. I asked what happened to it and her response was that the steak shrunk since it had to be cooked longer. Well we all know what happens to meat but it doesn't magically disappear and completely shrink away. So our meat still wasn't medium because it was only gone for a few mins and the plates given to us were on fire. They did say to be careful because they were hot but towards the end of the meal I pushed my plate away since it was too close to me and burned my finger. I had a blister 10 minutes later. My man did the same thing and I cannot believe anyone would serve plates that could burn you. We didn't finish the meat and barely touched the lobster mac & cheese. Over it at this point. When the server came over to clear our plates she said \"ouch these plates are hot, let me send someone else over to grab them\". She couldn't do them herself and most likely burned her hand as well.   Complimentary dessert was sent our way for his birthday but we just wanted to leave. I chose this place because we hadn't tried it before and it has great reviews. Unfortunately our experience wasn't typical and if the steak didn't come out raw it would have most likely been a much better overall experience. I could have dealt with the bad table, bland salad and missing steak but not with the plates on fire that burned our fingers.   For the record our server did take off $25 from the check. Not sure if it was for the missing piece of steak or our burns?",

    "text": "First Yelp of 2016!  I have been dying to try Del Frisco's ever since I heard of their Tomahawk. A little disappointed, rating should be between 3.5-4.  Reservation was easy to make. Came in a little early, but they would not seat us until the exact time even though it was pretty empty. Service was pretty on point, always refilled water and cleaned the table.  Parking was free.  Make sure you check out the 007 wine table. Pretty awesome.  The Franc - $45 - Good red wine. One of the cheaper bottles they have on their wine list.   Bread and Butter - Complementary. Bread was light and fluffy. Butter was so soft and creamy.   Steak Tartare - $17 - Nicely seasoned but the meat was cut terribly. There were thick chunks of meat and did not chew well. Had boiled eggs instead of the raw egg.   Sauteed Mushrooms - $11.50 - Cooked well but flavor was just ok.  Lobster Mac & Cheese - $18 - Good cheese sauce. Lobster meat was mixed throughout.   Chateau Potatoes - $12 - Gross - Worst potato dish I have ever had at a steak house. Thick brick of mush.  Tomahawk Wagyu Ribeye - $90 - Seasoning was pretty good. Char was nice. The foot long bone is pretty epic. Asked for medium rare. Some pieces were border line mooing. We had 4 on the table and all were the same. Pretty crappy cooking if 4 medium rares came out super under.",

The service is always top notch and super gracious. Even with a large group of people, I've never felt like I was either an inconvenience or irritation to the servers. The food served as a group menu isn't an afterthought as with most events. I usually order the same thing every year: the house salad, filet mignon, creamed spinach, lobster macaroni and cheese and cheesecake for dessert.   The house salad is strangely simple yet delicious. The best part is the super crispy slices of bacon on top. Del Frisco's does steak well, so if you're a meat eater you need to order the beef above anything else that may be offered (the chicken and fish are both tasty, but nothing is a great as the steak). The sides are good but not memorable and are your standard steakhouse fare. The cheesecake is my favorite dessert here too -- ask for it with extra berries!   The restaurant's atmosphere is swanky and old school. The place is appointed in lots of dark wood and there's a pianist in the bar. At Christmastime, the restaurant takes on an even more cozy look with strands of twinkling white lights.  Nobody looks forward to attending their spouse's office holiday party, but call me crazy because I do! And it's all because of the venue.",

The crust was extremely burnt..really strong burnt flavor. The steak was cooked medium but that's besides the point.  I was SO DISAPPOINTED but I was also hungry. I ate half of it and told our waiter. He offered to make a new one which was nice but I felt bad cause I already had eaten half the steak..so that's my fault I guess.   Another disappointment was my old-fashioned. The old-fashioned I got was one of the sweetest old-fashioned I've tried. There was way too much sugar! Not sure if they used sugar cubes or just dumped a bunch of sugar in. The drink had no balance. Maybe I'm too used to trying it at Whiskey bars but I expect better from a place like this.  Thick Cut Bacon Au Poivre as an appetizer: bacon was really thick but the texture was a bit too chewy. Sauteed Wild Mushrooms & Pearl Onions was whatever as a side. I wouldn't order it. I got a corn dish as a side and that was delicious!   A huge positive was that our server was attentive and helpful..and drinks came out extremely fast.  Overall, for the amount I paid for, I expected it a lot better. I really hope they were just having an off day for us :/ not sure if I'd come back though...",

They are a chain but this is definitely no Outback. Prices are comparable with any high-end steakhouse. Attire is business casual but feel free to dress up. You will not be out of place. All of the food is amazing. The crab cakes, Del's salad, tomatoes and burrata, and the 45 day aged prime ribeye are my personal favorites. Steaks are always cooked to the right temperature and taste like perfection. The sides are amazing especially the creamed corn and maque choux if they have it. Desserts have always been stellar and the drinks...the drinks are stiff and well worth it. Try the old fashioned or any of their specialty cocktails. The atmosphere is very old school and the service is what you would expect from a five star establishment. When I am in another city with Del Frisco's, it is going to be my first stop. Easy five stars.",

So was yelping away to try good new steak house other than chains like Ruth chris and Flemings.   Saw del frisco was popular.  Although I called one hour prior to their open time, they were able to let me rsvp for 645pm...  Errr I should have known and stopped right thurr!!   Usually good steak house and u calling on weekends, they are completely booked esp if u book in last minute.. I should have known...-__-  The restaurant was located away from the strip and had plenty of parking spots...  Ordered fried calamari as appetizer.  It was good, but how can you go wrong with fried food that's drenched in Thai sweet chili sauce....  Ok to the steak.  Decided to try tomahawk ribeye for first time!  Been wanting to try for a long time and thought this was it!   U r in Vegas and why not? Esp after looooong hard work week!  D-i-s-s-a-p-o-i-n-t-m-e-n-t....  It was the worst 90 dollar steak I ever had in my life...   The taste was so blend...  I needed some kim chi right away -__-   Only had four bites and got rest to go... How can u waste 90 dollar steak.. And the sauteed mushroom was not that great either.... I feel as the Yelp reviews for this restaurant is biased..  I wonder if people came here to eat after they are drunk so their taste bud is biased or seems like lotta fobs wrote reviews here... They need to go try different steak house in America... Errrr...  Sorry about the bad review.. But was soooooooooo disappointed... If you are spending over 150 dollars just on food, I expect the food to be better-",

I did get pumped by some of the reviews so maybe my expectations were to high because it didnt top the my chart for best steak, but it was good. We selected a side of sauteed mushrooms and potatos.  The sides were ok as well.  For desert we had cheesecake, and it wasumm not good.

I had lobster macaroni and cheese as a side dish (needs to be shared by two) and lamb as an entree. It was both prepared with perfection. The lamb was served with the right tenderness and seasoning. You can taste the lobster in the macaroni and cheese without the cheese overpowering the dish. I tasted my friend's prime porterthouse and it was also a good choice to order. The staff was attentive and never left you with an empty glass.   The only reason it was given four stars instead of five was due to the second wine pour had sediments floating in my wine glass and coffee grounds in my coffee cup.  The overall experience was enjoyable and highly recommended for couples, special family occasions, and corporate gatherings.",

Anyway, I'd been looking forward to visiting Del Frisco's from the day I found out we were going. I'd been going over what I would get - what entree, what appetizer, etc etc. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint.   Here's what I ordered:  - Double eagle bone in prime strip  - sauteed mushrooms - asparagus - lobster macaroni and cheese   I also got to try some of the shrimp scampi from my mom's plate.   What a feast! Let me tell you, that steak was well worth the $60 or however much it is. It was humongous but it was so full of flavor and it was so moist. The food was pretty much amazing. However, I wasn't too keen on the salad that came with the meal. I ordered a Caesar salad and I think the cheese was just a little too sharp for my taste. Whatever, it's a freaking steak house! I don't care about the salad! I can't really say much else about the food, other than I was really diggin' it.   I also have to mention the service at this place. It is definitely second to none. Our server was so nice and helpful, we even recruited him to take a bunch of pictures of our family and he helped us out without even skipping a beat and was really nice about it.   Del Frisco's was definitely the right place to go and splurge a little bit and have a really good time with some really good eats. I will definitely come out here again when I've got a hankering for a meat coma.",

Their steaks are cooked to perfection.  They even prepared my hubby's charred medium rare.  Most restaurants either won't do that or try and fail.  The shrimp cocktail was delicious and their desserts to die for!  Can't decide if I like the lemon cake or chocolate souffle better.  Try the coffee it is amazing too.  Our waiter recommended the creamed spinach and I was a little hesitant to order it.  I'm sure glad I took his recommendation!  Wow it was so delicious!  They treated my hubby so well and made his birthday dinner memorable!  Oh and don't forget to grab a VIP drink from the bar before you are seated.  The bartender is fun and on top of things.  Can't wait to dine here again!",

Anyway, eventually got to our table,and was greeted by our coach, I mean, waiter.  I don't remember his name, but when he was letting us know about the specials, he was pacing back and forth as if we were heading out to the Superbowl, or maybe even war...  I began to think that as we were ordering, they had a script of sorts that he HAS to follow?  His response to my ordering the medium rare prime rib, \"pink in the middle, and warm all the way through\".  The same for everyone else who had their steak the same... and whatever other variations other people had... By the 5th or so echo.... I started to get annoyed, but whatever.  The pink, and warm all the way through was juicy, and melt in your mouth wonderful... Definitely one of he best steaks I've ever had...  Oh, by the way... The James Bond table?  Didn't realize what it was.  Just walked by it as were leaving.  Halogen bulbs focused right onto the wine bottles?  Aren't most wine cellars supposed to be climate controlled?",

The lobster tail came beautifully arranged, tasted good but missed the tenderness it usually has with warmed butter. They should serve it with butter but they didn't. Service was fun and quick after we got the order in. Only gripe is location which isn't close to the strip. No question get the filet mignon!!",

This place is amazing!  My friends and I called for a reservation the day of and did not have a problem getting a table considering it was a Friday night.  We waited only a few minutes after getting there before we were seated at our table.  They have the most professional staff working here, our server, JP, was so attentive and answered any question we had about the menu and even recommended which steak I should try.  I ended up ordering the 22 oz. bone-in rib eye cooked medium and it was the best piece of meat I have ever had.  I'm sure you're thinking I'm exaggerating but I'm not, this steak was THAT good.... the real deal.  And it made me feel a little better knowing that my $50 was well spent.  Everything else was just a bonus.  We had a slice of the lemon cake which was good but a little too sweet for me.  It was more than enough for five people.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I highly recommend Del Frisco's to anyone willing to try it.  Who cares about the price... you only live once.

Went Sat night before Superbowl.  The good. The steaks are top grade and cooked well. Well seasoned too. The atmosphere is classy steak joint, although the lights and ambience could be refined a bit more.  Our server was great, us 3 dudes, giving her a good ribbing, and she was fun and engaging. But that's about all that was good.  The bad. After being seated very close to our ressy time (8:30) we quickly ordered wine and then shortly after, dinner. The wine and tasty bread came, but no dinner.. Still waiting.. and still... 45 min later. We even had to ask our server what the hold up was and we rarely complain. I would expect this if we were on \"Island Time\"  in the caribbean. But this is Vegas and not acceptable.  I got the bone-in fillet which was very tasty, as were the other steaks at the table. But, the sides, grilled asparagus and garlic mushrooms, left much to be desired. Seems like not much care went into preparing these dishes, aside from dosing them with copious amounts of salt.   Overall for the price, which was quite steep, I expect more. I've had much better dining experiences at steak joints for less then $600 (our bill for 3).  For that price, the experience needs to be grade A, top shelf, not  run of the mill average.. I won't be back.",

The ceasar salad with anchovies was perfect, the lettuce was very fresh with no brown edges and the anchovies make the salad perfect to my liking.  We had a nice bottle of Silver Oak cab and had sauteed mushrooms and potatoes for the sides.  The service is what you would expect at this type of restaurant, not too pushy or trying to hurry you to order.  But tentative enough to make sure your water or wine glass is never empty.    We have eaten hear many times and never had any complaints, the service is what keeps us coming back.",

However, Del Frisco's went above and beyond of not only meeting my expectations, but exceeding them.   My personal recommendations are the filet mignon which one could cut with a fork, the crab cake which is by far the best crab cake I have ever had ever and the baked potato is nothing short of awesome as well.

    "text": "Have been here many times and service has never been an issue.   We had a friend in town so decided to drop by for some drinks and steaks. The boys both got the prix fixe and I opted to nosh on tartare to start with and crab cakes for my main.   First flag: ordered a bottle of wine, it arrived before water for the table. Second flag: my tartare app arrived before the boys' salads (so we ended up sharing the tartare, NBD) Third flag: as the empty tartare plate was being cleared, the boys' steaks arrive!  So we were all confused. Where were their salads? Flagged down the server, he offered to bring the steaks back out to the table after salads were finished. Friend decided to hang on to his steak, hubby opted to send it back to kitchen and eat salad first.  Fourth flag: Hubby got his steak and asked for kosher salt on side (med-rare steak with no seasoning, we've learned from our many trips here that they over-salt for our taste buds even if we ask them to go light, so we ask for no seasoning). What he got was an overcooked steak (we all thought they were going to re-cook his steak instead of keeping it under the heat lamps) and a bowl of morton's table salt. Of course, by this time, our friend had already finished his steak. Hubby didn't send his steak back since we didn't want to make our friend wait.  Fifth flag: on top of all the missteps, the server had the nerve to try to up sell desserts and after dinner drinks while my husband was still eating! Dude, do you have a brain? Don't try to rush us out after you were the one who messed things up!  Needless to say, we won't be back. Will have to find another place to take our friends to when they come in town.",

Crab cake was bomb.  The oysters were good and fresh and the king crab legs were awesome.  I love the service here, everyone was friendly and fun and playful when engaged.  For Dessert I had the Mousse I believe it was, maybe I'll upload pictures.  It was TDF.  My friend got the lemon cake to take home for his bday wish I would have tasted that.   Supposed to be really good.  The lounge singer was a little cheesy but overall great place. Sorry for lack of details but I waited two weeks to write this.",

    "text": "Del Frisco is always my choice of steakhouse over Ruth Chris and Morton. One of my meal has to be in Del Frisco when I was in business trip at Vegas, one of the reason is because they don't have a branch in the Los Angeles area and the bigger reason was their Stone Crab Claws.   It is obvious the meat quality between Ruth Chris, Morton and Del Frisco are pretty much the same, the major difference would be the use of spices, how accurate was the steak degree of doneness, seafood choices and the quality of side dishes in my opinion. I prefer my steak with heavier seasonings and Del Frisco really satisfied my preference. They never mess up my steak doneness(Ruth Chris and Morton both screwed up once). That shows me chefs with high level skill quality were behind the kitchen door.   Jumbo stone crab claw is a must try at Del Frisco, the mouthwatering claws cook perfectly as it locks in their sweet, delicate flavor. Even their side dishes were excellent. I always like sauteed mushroom and angel hair pasta. Very simple side dishes but they were perfected with the right seasonings and cooking skill.   Highly recommended for anyone who wants to experience high quality steaks dinner. Remember to leave some room for their desserts too.",

    "text": "So, I was here for a conference and we had a pri-fixed menu.   Upon entering, I was greeted by a very VERY VERY unpleasant rancid odor. I was on the verge of just turning around and going home if I wasn't interested in hearing the speaker at the conference.  I mean WOW!  I was almost knocked out!  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that the kitchen didn't smell like that!  Once we sat down, the waiters brought over two loaves (yes, LOAVES) of sesame bread.  Let me tell you, I LOVED IT... I pretty much ate one entire loaf by myself.  It was very soft and pillow-y with a touch of chewy crust.  Definitely something you have to try if you don't care about counting carbs.  For the appetizer, they brought out grilled shrimp with two types of sauces.  One was the traditional cocktail sauce and the other was a mayonnaise-based sauce (it probably had a little ketchup in it because it was pink....I know there's a name for it, but can not think of it at the moment).  A little oily for my taste (the shrimp), but it was pretty good nonetheless.  Not something that I would order if I came back, but not bad.    The salad was a miss for me.  The flavors were good, however there was a GIGANTIC glob of dressing in the middle of the plate!  They do not toss the salad for you and give waaaay too much dressing.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side like I always do, but I had forgotten to request it.  There were also two HUGE strips of bacon laid across the salad and who doesn't like bacon right?!  The bacon tasted amazing!  Too bad I was feeling guilty about eating the one whole loaf of bread earlier that I only took a small bite of the bacon....  The entree that was served was the filet mignon.  It was pretty good.  I ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.  However, the waiters asked if the guests could cut into their filet immediately to determine if the done-ness was correct.  I found that weird and would hope that it was only a rule to guests that were in the conference and NOT for the general dining area customers!  So let me begin this paragraph by saying, the ONLY reason this place didn't get 2 stars (especially for that awful odor at the entrance and the waiters insisting of the guest cutting into the filet as they watched us) is because of the dessert that they served:  BANANA BREAD PUDDING!!!  Sounds unassuming doesn't it?  Bread pudding, what can be so amazing about that?  Well, it was one to the most HEAVENLY thing I have ever tasted in my freaking ENTIRE life!  The bread budding came out warm and drizzled with a caramel sauce that was not too outrageously sweet.  As I dug my spoon into it, I realized that there was a crust on the top.  When I took a bit into it, I fell in love.  The crust was chewy and caramelized and packed so much flavor.  Then it was followed by the softness of the rest of the bread pudding.  The banana flavor was strong, however not over-powering at all.  This dessert really worked for me.  I can't believe I would get this excited over bread pudding, but there you have it.  If you can get through the entrance without throwing up, you NEED to order the Banana Bread Pudding.",

After spending a fortnight deciding where to eat before my girlfriend went to cancer treatment in Soma, California I randomly chose Del Frisco's (After having spent 11 years driving past it). It definitely was in my top 5 decisions of all time.  The atmosphere and hospitality immediately spilled outside the restaurant, the valet Slava was rad. He made sure my Mazda was well taken care of after assuring me it would be. I love when people do what they say.   The second we walked into the lobby we were greeted by the hostesses, Anji who would later seat us, was amazing she told us how great everything was and that this place was the best. She even showed us the James Bond table and told us all the actors too. What a beauty!  Upon being sat we were given an order of bread by some behemoth of a man. I think his name was Jorgen or Xander, I don't remember I had knocked a few VIPs out by this point.  Then my steak came. I ate that thing so quick. So damn good.",

    "text": "This is a difficult one due to the stellar ratings that this place gets time and time again.  i will have to say that i walked in with very high expectations.  We walked in to celebrate a reunion of sorts, from seeing a bunch of friends in Las Vegas after a long time of living in different areas of the country.  On top of that, 2 of the folks were recently promoted, and 2 more recently had kids...  The food did not disappoint, and most of the recommendations were right on the money.  here is what i enjoyed: Crab cakes were as good as people said The spinach was as good as everyone says...\"bacon in every bite\" We also had asparagus, lobster mac which were good, but not earth shattering. For dinner, i had split with another big eater the Wagyu Rib Eye (medium rare of course, not some other overcooked way to eat very high quality beef) - and it was excellent.  As far as the rating, i would say that it met my expectations, making it at best 4 stars, but since i knowingly went in with very high expectations due to the postings i pre-reviewed, my expectations exceeded most other places that i ever go to.  if i have to go to a nice dinner in LV, i will come here again.  The price mirrors most places that one would call \"a nice restaurant\".  you wont leave here on the cheap, but at the same time you wont leave feeling underwhelmed either.  you will get a great meal, with great wait staff that wont rush you out and will serve you and entertain.  The waiters did make an effort above and beyond the call of duty.  One of our group was bragging about how he \"doesnt drink beverages with  fruit or vegetables\" as a real man.  Amongst the guys, we all cracked up when the waiter \"couldnt help it\" to bring his red bull vodka with a mint leaf.  yes the rest of us gave him extra tip just for that!",

My bf ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye and I had the Filet Mignon.  The meat was top quality and the rub that was on the rib eye was amazing.  Our steaks were cooked a perfect medium rare.  My Filet was extremely tender and delicious.  Their sides are served family style so it's enough for a couple people to share.  We got broccoli that was cooked perfectly for a side.  I also had a baked potato which was a decent size.  For dessert we had a cheesecake that was extremely creamy.  It was slightly creamier than we would've liked, but still good.  Our server, if I remember correctly was named Lisa and she was amazing.  So friendly and gave great recommendations.  Everyone who waited on us was extremely friendly and professional.  We are definitely going back when we are in town next!  Also, our receipt came with a survey so we get $25 off our next visit!  Great deal!",

Steak arrived on a hot, buttered plate.  The rib eye was perfectly seasoned, tender and juicy.  I was literally sawing bits off the bone to get every last morsel, including the fatty bits.  The warm truffle butter sauce was amazing.  We were dipping our sesame bread into the sauce too.  The corn maque choux goes perfectly with the steak - it has a crispy, juicy texture versus the traditional creamed corn that is served at prime rib restaurants.  And the 6-layer lemon cake is enormous, moist and delicious without being overly sweet. It can be shared across your party.    Double thumbs up to Del Frisco's!",

    "text": "After looking at reviews for a few hours on Yelp, this is where we decided to have our post-wedding dinner with our family.   The staff was all very nice, we had a wonderful waitress, and they put us in a back corner so that we had some privacy.   For starters I had a classic salad with avocado ranch dressing, and it was delicious. The veggies were all very crisp, and the avocado put a nice spin on your average ranch dressing. The salad comes with two thick pieces of bacon crossed over it, which I gave to the man and he loved them, and some big homemade croutons that were wonderful, and I very rarely like any croutons in my salad at all. It's a texture thing. Aaanyways.  The shrimp cocktail comes with BIG jumbo shrimp smothered in cocktail sauce, and it was also very fresh and tasty.  For dinner I ordered the bone in prime rib and the man ordered the bone in filet mignon. The bone in filet mignon is an off menu item, but it is INCREDIBLE. If you want it medium rare you have to order it medium because it's so thick, if you order it medium rare you'll get a rare center. It was the best steak I ever had. My steak was also delicious, and I really loved the crust on it.  For sides we had asparagus, green beans, and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly, and with asparagus and green beans it really makes a difference.  For dessert we had lemon cake on the house to celebrate our new marriage. I am not a cake person at all, and i'm REALLY not a lemon cake person, but it was absolutely delicious. The cake was really light and flavorful, not sour or tart at all. We were surprised at how much we loved it.  Overall it was a great dinner and an amazing experience, we made the right choice having our wedding dinner there. Everyone had a great time, and an excellent meal, and it was the perfect ending to our special day. Thank you Del Frisco's for making such a memorable meal for us. :)",

There are many American steak houses that are not up to my standards in terms of quality and taste such as Ruth Chris or Houston's, however Del Friscos makes ones of the best tasting states ever!  I had the bone-in-rib-eye steak (22 ounces i believe), medium  and for $49.95. The steak is extremely big, fits basically on the majority of the plate. The steak is super fresh, delivered from the ranch every 2 weeks and never frozen. The steak doesn't need any steak sauces as the the pepper and the nature taste of the steak of more than sufficient. I would recommend getting some sides such as the mushrooms, potatoes etc...  Their famous drink made at the restaurant is their pineapple vodka. the pineapple is aged for a few weeks with vodka. The 5 ounces is very smooth and strong.  This place is a great place to eat after a dance, a Broadway show, a classy party etc.. Its a real classy, high end place :)",

If you aren't willing to spend money on a steakhouse dinner then obviously this restaurant isn't for you. They also have an AMAZING happy hour!",

    "text": "i came here for valentines day with my boyfriend and we had reservations. when we arrived, they told us that they were running behind. me and my boyfriend waited an hour to be seated. we had another engagement that we had reservations for after dinner! that was outrageous to wait an hour even though we showed up ahead of time for our reservation! even after that, we were just hoping the food would be the savior of the night. it wasn't. they sat us on a small circle table that was wobbly with a cheap white cloth over it. for the upscale look and the prices on their menu, you would think they can afford something nicer? apparently not. i ordered a salad to start off and i told the waitress that i was allergic to tomatoes and to not have them in my house salad i ordered. i also wanted extra crispy bacon and cesar dressing instead of the dressing it came with. when it arrived my bacon wasn't extra crispy and there were no avocados.  even though i had been told there were avocados in the salad. my waitress was nowhere to be found so i had told a waiter that passed by what was wrong with my order and he said he would go fix it. when he came back, tomatoes were in my salad, and the dressing wasn't a cesar dressing, and there were still no avocados. when the waitress finally came around i told her that my salad was wrong the first time and that i had just gotten a new salad and there are still things wrong with it. she told me that the dressing is an avocado dressing and they don't have actual avocados to put in my salad, even though she told me it had avocados in it. i told her i didn't want the salad and that i would just want my filet mignon i ordered. the filet wasn't tender. and it didn't have any real seasoning. it was a little dry and a little tough. usually when i order a filet, it is easily cut like butter. this one wasn't. the only good thing there was the lemon cake. it was extremely good. however, a lemon cake will not keep me coming back. they have lousy customer service that is worse than there food.",

But it also had that nice clubby feel.  As a girl, I wasn't turned off by all the man trappings.  Our server was spectacular, well versed in the menu and sensitive to our time issues (a concert).  The starters, side dishes and desserts are all done family style.  Hubby said that his NY Strip was the best he's had.  I tasted it, seasoned and JUICY.  My fillet was great.   Definitely a great place to come and get away from the feeling that you are in Vegas.",

Second, the food- all above average, steaks good not great , sides very good and of course the Lemon cake very good but nothing more than four stars and that is being generous...  So where is the issue...THE WINE....are your frigging kidding me...this list was put together by some pistol pack'n flunky from deep inside the Del Frisco headquarters...they don't allow corkage yet within their limited wine selection they feature- Educated Guess- a red wine for the Bev Mo crowd...and I am sure Del Frisco can pick it up for about $6 a bottle and they sell for $15 a glass...and that is one of the more thoughtful choices on the -by the glass- menu...absolutely shameful...it killed the whole experience for me and if you like wine with your meal it will kill it for you as well..",

They made our meal of VIP martinis (amazing by the way....fresh pineapple infused vodka chilled straight up with an orange twist), ribeye, petite filet oscar style, asparagus, skillet potatoes and potatoes au gratin that much more enjoyable (who knew that was possible).   We ended up tucking our knees up and practically rolling out the door because we were so full but very happy. Will always come back to Del's for the food, drinks and fun.

Don't come to dinner with a rush to get out-- stay, relax, and enjoy the meal, the service, and the atmosphere!  The crab cakes are to die for. The Bone-In filet or ribeye will literally melt in your mouth, I can still taste the freshness of the veggies to this day!  Oh and the lobster mac n' cheese... Yum! No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. If you have a complaint about this restaurant in any way shape or form... you're just one of those people who can't be pleased!   After dining with Del Friscos--your waiter/waitress will mail you a Thank you card for dining with them. Again, an over the top (personable) experince!",

I wish the HH drink selection was larger, it only encompasses a few house liquors, 1 house special drink, and beers. All the cocktails are still full price, be careful. The burger was large and delicious, cooked to medium rare nicely. The scallops Rockefeller was 2 good sized and tasty chunks. The only underwhelming dish in the meal was the potato crisp with goat cheese. Not worth it. My burger came with more potato crisps than that whole dish order! I would like to come back again and try more bar menu foods. Nice ambiance.",

They would explain everything you need to know about the daily specials, way to cook, etc etc.  Service is superb too.  Steak quality is USDA Prime.  Perfectly cooked to the way you preferred.  They change their Steak of Today menu regularly, but you won't go wrong with either the porterhouse or ribeye which are always on the menu.  Don't forget to order cheesecake.  It is a plain cheesecake that comes with either pecan butterscotch or real strawberry sauce.  The texture is awesome and never too heavy.  I couldn't have the same quality cheesecake anywhere in SoCal.   BIG Con: They do not allow beverages/wines from outside.  That's why I subtracted 1 star from 5...  Be prepared to be charged at least double of what you will pay from outside.",

The ambiance of the place is very cozy and welcoming. Dimly lit, but not too dark. The staff was very attentive, everything was done in a very timely manner.   we started off with the complimentary bread basket. warm and soft with tasty butter spread.   I ordered the 16oz rib eye and had a side of sautee mushrooms and lobster mac n cheese.   the steak was cooked perfectly to a med-rare, really tender. the 16oz was the perfect portion size before a night of drinking.   A+ on the sautee mushrooms, it was simple, but it complimented the steak very well.   the lobster mac n cheese was a bit on the salty side, but soooo good. there are bits of lobster meat and the lobster flavors really comes through the mac n cheese.   my bill came out to a bit over $50... not bad for quality food and service.",

They not only served us perfectly within the restaurant, but within a week we got a card from Del Frisco's thanking us for our patronage.  If that's not enough, we also received a Christmas card from them again this year.  I definitely feel loved as a customer.  One of the best parts of this restaurant (especially for me, because I tend to be very picky about the way my steak is cooked) is that once the steak arrives at your table, the server will cut into the steak and show you the middle to ensure that the steak has been cooked the right way.  If it's not it'll go directly back to the kitchen. Add that to the truffle butter they bring melting happily over a tealight, the steak here is heavenly.  The only reason I've docked a star from this place is because when we went, my husband's filet mignon was chewy and tough (as if it was a piece of muscle or something?).  However, when we told the waiter about this, they immediately changed his filet for a new one, which was really nice, but I do wish they had gotten it right the first time.  The sides and desserts were delicious, but not as memorable as the steak which was definitely the main star in this restaurant.  If you're visiting Vegas and hankering for a delicious piece of meat, you won't go wrong coming here.    Don't forget to ask for the truffle butter!",

Without wine you can escape for probably 120 bucks or so, but what's the point of that? You don't skimp on this type of meal. The service was absolutely top notch and the sommelier knowledgeable (though he didn't look a day over 25) maybe he was just a waiter, but nonetheless knowledgeable, non-snobby, and friendly.

    "text": "Yes, this is as good as it gets!  I'm so glad we found this place with Yelp via my little mobile phone when a group of friends and I were in Vegas several weekends ago.  At first, we got lost and had to turn around by Desert Inn Road which 1) didn't allow a u-turn -and- 2) it's actually a long road that takes you all the way over to the other side before letting you turn around, so it took us awhile to find it, but we found it nevertheless.  Upon pulling into the parking lot at about 10pm on a Saturday night, there were plenty of parking spots, so it took us a whole 5 seconds to do so.  Walking in, we passed by a group of folks who looked like they just had their wedding reception there, so that's a good sign... right?  Got to the front desk and told them I made reservations for 3 about 15 minutes ago and they found us right away, and showed us to a table with a view of the bar and the piano man.    The atmosphere was unbelievably nice... the dim lights, the jazz music...everything that I like about a classic steakhouse.  After reading some people's reviews on Yelp, I decided to go with the 6 oz. filet mignon \"smaller meal\" because I could never finish a big piece of steak.  We were going to get two sides to split family style (spinach supreme and sauteed onions), so it should be plenty of food... and it was.  The other two people I was with ordered a porterhouse and I believe a rib eye.  Everything tasted SO good.  They were truly the melt in your mouth steaks that I've always dreamed about but never really got to experience.   =)  On top of that, I enjoyed the side dishes as well as the bread they serve you in the very beginning.  The butter that came with the bread was just amazing.  Something so simple yet can taste so different.  Now for the dessert... it was my bf's birthday so they served a multiple layered lemon cream cake on the house.  We were stuffed, but the moment I took a bite, I kept on going and going and going, like an Energizer Bunny.  I'm a dessert fanatic, but this one tops SO many other desserts I've had.  It was not too rich, not too sweet, had the perfect ratio of cake to cream and it had just the right fluffiness.  It's to die for... over and over again.  Of course the impeccable service helped a lot too in the overall experience.  They stayed next to us when our steaks were served, asking if we could cut it open to make sure that it was the right amount of doneness that we were seeking.  The waiter even had a flashlight in case we couldn't see it well. :LOL:    Until that night, my favorite steakhouse was Ruth's Chris, but I have to say this surpasses Ruth's Chris by a mile!  I'd go back there in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Vegas.  It was worth the $200 total (incl. tax and tips) for the three of us.",

Nicely decorated and comfortable. After some consulting with our waiter Andrew we settled on splitting a bone in New York strip.  Unfortunately for a prime cut and cost it was a bit grisly. However they were very apologetic and comped us 25% of the steak and a couple deserts to make up for it. The nice part was we only off handedly mentioned it to Anthony the wine guy. We didn't expect to be comped anything. So very nice gesture on there part. I recommend this place and would love to give more stars. I think they just tripped on this one. We'll be back to give it a go again",

We ended up using the bread to sop up all the sauce. The waiter came back to a shiny clean plate.  I had the Porterhouse and my GF had the Prime Strip. Both of our steaks were perfectly cook, perfectly seasoned. The blue cheese mac-n-cheese wasn't bad either. Definitely my favorite steakhouse.   Good: Almost everything, esp the steaks! Bad: No locations in nor-cal! Ok: Service was not the best but it wasn't bad at all.",

There were five of us and we all left stuffed (and we actually spent less than I thought we would.)  There wasn't really a bad part of the meal.  With there being five of us, I got to try a bunch of stuff.  For an appetizer, I would recommend the Crab Cake.  Only got one bite but it was awesome!  For sides, the mac & cheese was great.  The onion rings were good too and the most massive you will ever see.  For the entree, I loved my Filet but nearly everyone at the table got a different cut and like it.  For desert, the Lemon Cake has pretty much the best frosting on earth.    With a few drinks, I think I spent about $80 on my meal.  I have spent far more than that in Vegas, and gotten much worse food, so I definitely recommend it to all",

My gf ordered a fillet and we split an order of the lobster mac and cheese. Once again they did not disappoint. My steak was made to my order and you could almost pull it apart with a fork. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and paired an excellent wine with the meal. And no, they did not steer us to the pricier wines. They actually recommended a very well priced house wine.   I also enjoy the ambiance of the business. It's off the strip so it's a nice break away from the big resorts when you're out there. I've been there several times and I always look forward to going back.",

Sadly, because of my experience at the Las Vegas location on May 15, I will never be a Del Frisco's cheerleader again.  Went to grab a quick drink after work on Friday with my girlfriend.  There was no where to sit or hardly stand in the bar, so we asked the host if we could sit at a table even though we knew we wouldn't be dining there because we were on a short timeframe.  She said it was fine and seated us, but then the server (Marciano) got upset that we were sitting at a table and not ordering dinner.  We ordered an appetizer as a good gesture but ended up cancelling the order because the manager (Chris) approached us with the same information.  We ended up drinking our cocktails at the well station where the servers come to pick up drinks from the bartender, which was very annoying because we constantly had to move out of their way.  Marciano and Chris were very rude and made us feel like we weren't good enough for Del Frisco's.  For that I will NEVER return.",

When I got there I found out the restaurant is actually a high end steak house and I thought to myself James Bond wine and good steak! How can life get any better? Well, unfortunately the wine is all specialty made and you cant drink it. But you can push the hidden button to make the table reveal its secret which was awesome!   The service here was perfect! My glasses of wine and water never ran empty and the sommelier was at our table early without even asking to assist with the wine selection. The bartender accidently  charged our table for drinks we never ordered and when we brought this to the attention of our waiter the manager came over and comped our deserts for the mistake without us even asking which was great.  As for the food: The crab cakes are a must, order many of them and enjoy! The lobster mac & cheese is also great very unhealthy and great. The steak however was just ok hence the lack of 5 stars. We had the double eagle bone in ribeye which was the best on their menu. It was by no means bad but I can think of a couple places that were much better, but those steak houses are much more expensive and often have less personal service.  All and all I would absolutely return here for many reasons. It was a great experience and the check was not as bad as I would of expected for what we got. The food and service were great overall.",

On top of everything, and gave us the best value in compared to the Palm, Mc Cormick and Schmeck, and other private rooms we priced out.  All but three of our guests, had steaks and were raving. The other three had Chicken, Tuna, and Salmon, and were pleased. Great sides, mashed potatoes, were the best, great service.  It's very rare that Wedding Banquet Food can be ordered off a menu, and get the quality you would expect during regular dinning time.   Best Filet I have ever eaten in Las Vegas!!!!

    "text": "There are a lot of steak houses in Vegas, and especially on the strip..... but if you meander just a little bit off the strip you'll find this hidden Vegas gem.  To start, this is not a Vegas restaurant.  It's a small chain that has a few spots around the country.  But this is a great spot to have one on the West coast.  Del Frisco's is a very classy/trendy place that won't scrutinize if you're not dressed up.  I would recommend that you dress up at least business casual.  It's kind of nice to do so.  When you walk in you hear the live piano player.  I think he gives the place a special ambiance.  Onto the food..... to start, the bread that they give you is NOT your ordinary bread.  This is freshly made in-house, light, airy, and sesame-seedy goodness.  Honestly, you could eat one whole one yourself and not ruin your appetite.  Get more than one.  Trust me.  Steaks are at the level of the top steak houses on the strip, but just a little more oomph in flavor and tenderness.  Hot recommendation is the bone-in rib eye.  But the last time I went I shared the Kobe waygu.  I think it was a 32 oz steak.  Definitely big enough for two.  If it's you and your girl, get one steak, order a side of veggies, maybe their lobster mac n' cheese or potatoes.... and you'll be in heaven.  Ask them to show you their James Bond wine box.  It's pretty cool.  But you HAVE TO ASK!!!!",

Most of the group went with the various filet mignon cuts offered (including a sampler special), and while I wasn't quite hungry enough to get the full double eagle (32oz), the classic porterhouse was done up just right, a red but not bloody medium, and delicious sides that are wholly unnecessary.  Last time I was here was the first time I ate (and had room for) dessert -- we had the molten chocolate cake. Very decadent but not overdone, and served with a scoop of ice cream to play off the warm of the cake and provide light contrast visually and flavorfully. Nothing amazing compared to the steak, but nice to split if you are in the mood.  Note: this place cooks their stake on the rare side, so usually it's a good idea to kick up your preferences by a point (i.e. get medium if you usually prefer medium-rare).",

I found the bread to be good not great,  I found the ceasar salad to be good not great.  I found the onion rings to be very good but the mashed potatoes poor.  The lemon cake mediorce, very plain.

Pushing sour wine on people just because the bottle has been opened, and disregarding the opinion of the person at the table who you are pouring for is a little offending. I'm sorry, I know wine, and that bottle was off. It was past it's prime and going to vinegar, and for you to not listen to my opinion and to try and change my opinion by saying \"it will blow off\" is slightly offensive. Then you left and never came back. By the way, it never blew off. Sour wine for dinner with steak was really fantastic.

The lobster mac n cheese and asparagus were our sides. They are family style portions, and given the richness of everything you'll be having, you won't need more than two or three sides for a party of four (and you'll have leftovers, too).  The portions in general are very \"classic steakhouse\" big. I also had a wedge salad, which was not too heavy on the dressing and everything was fresh as you'd like.  The wine list is HUGE and there are plenty of selections at all price points. My wife and I split a half bottle (next to last page).   My brother pointed something out about the prices. While this place is not cheap, it seems that similar quality steak, salads, sides, and appetizers cost about 20% more on The Strip.   The piano featured some familiar hits including Bobby Brown's \"Don't Be Cruel.\" Make sure to ask to see the James Bond table because it's truly unique.",

My server Travis was not only friendly and attentive but very knowledgeable of the menu. Very impressed with the service here. When Travis asked how I'd like my steak cooked, he went the extra mile to say that \"their\" medium rare is red in the center and medium is pink. Most restaurants I go to won't even bother.    I like the fact that they want to make sure the steak is cooked to my liking by having me cut through the middle. I was hoping to try the Asparagus soup that was pictured here on Yelp somewhere but that must be a seasonal offer so I ended up getting the Seafood soup which turned out to be very good. I am a big fan of banana desserts so naturally I went for the Banana bread pudding but that was just was ok, I have had better. Despite the dessert not being outstanding, overall though, I still would rate this place a 5 star.",

Melt in your mouth and seasoned perfectly. The house sesame loaf bread was delicious! it came with soft whipped butter.  They currently have a $99/couple promo which includes salad, crab cake, filet, side, and dessert. They allowed a few of us to order it individually for $50, paying the different to upgrade the steak.  I ordered their 22oz usda prime bone-in rib-eye medium rare. It came out perfect! The seasoning is amazing! Definitely the best steak I've ever had. The sides are large enough to share...so when those came out, 6-7 other helpers came out serving everyone sides. It was crazy! We had sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach,potatoes, and broccoli. The crab cake was delicious! It was 99% real crab meat...  Ask to see their \"James Bond\" table...it's the wooden round table near the lobby area. It opens automatically to review 15-20 bottles of wine....each hand-painted with a different James Bond movie.  I would definitely be back the next time I\"m in Vegas... it's off the strip and probably walkable...but just cab it if you don't have a car.   Oh yeah..no shorts, t-shirts, or flip-flops.

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to stop by in both Las Vegas and New York. The food is always excellent but what made my most recent visit special was the level of service they gave us. We went there to eat early (at 5pm) since we had some young children in our party (somewhat large of 10 people) so we were a little nervous if it was okay. They were extremely accommodating and ensured the table was all set up well prior to us getting there with booster seats, crayons, papers etc. They also brought out the kids food early so they were happy and relaxed. Generally speaking, especially when it gets busy, I wouldn't say that this is a location that is great for kids but if you go early when it is a bit more empty, you can make it work.    My favorite things to order: -Crab Cakes -Raw Oysters -Shrimp Cocktail Sampler -Rock Crab Claws -Rib Eye or Filet (ideally try Bone In) -Lobster Mac -Potatoes Au Gratin -Mushrooms  Their desserts and wines are excellent as well. Since we don't have the steakhouse in California, I would definitely recommend stopping by if you are in the area.",

My husband and I got the crabcake (SO GOOD), the porterhouse steak (AMAZING) and the filet trio (this was so-so).  We also got a side of lobster mac 'n cheese to share which was pretty darn good.  All in all, I'd recommend going with a more traditional cut of steak with no-frills.  The toppings on the filets were a little too much in my opinion.    Also, make sure that you ask to see the James Bond table!  Very worth it. :)",

I had a crab cake and Wagyu tomahawk and it was amazing! I just blasted through the whole meal. The meat was tender, juicy and well seared; the flavors were just amazing and the staff was really nice and helpful and gave a very good service. The portions were great as well and I had a full tummy by the time I left. Great price and great food. What else do you need in a restaurant? Definitely going to go again to try their other steaks!",

Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese, Asparagus, Sauteed Mushrooms all really good. Corn was whatevers. They came around and served us all sides family style. Very cool.  Service: Amazing. Servers had us cut into our steaks to make sure they were cooked to our liking. Sides were served to us. Water was never empty, someone always came to check up on us and all the servers were very friendly.   Price: Very reasonable. 32oz bone-in Wagyu ribeye was ~$90.

The staff here provides impeccable service as well as an overall pleasant experience.  The sesame bread that they give you is freakin addicting that I regret not saving room for my steak. I had their signature drink, the VIP (a pineapple infused vodka), but I stopped after one because it did taste like a bad hangover waiting to happen. I normally don't eat seafood, but I actually thought the crab cake tasted good.  This is one of the very few places I've ever dined where I can say I was babied (in a good way)! They cut and served our lobster, served our lobster mac & cheese, served our potatoes au gratin, help split the humongous tomahawk wagyu into two portions, and even helped another Yelper take foodie pics muahaha. I should've visited the restroom to see if they wipe for me too!  I had the prime ribeye which was awesomely delicious and cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested. It was a 16oz hunk of meat that I wished came in a smaller portion (never thought I'd ever say that). They definitely make it a priority to make sure the steak is cooked to your liking.  We came here for a birthday, and it was a cute little touch that the staff all signed a card for the celebrant. We got to indulge in a six-layer lemon cake which was so light and yummy without it being overly sweet.  I would definitely return in the future, but will make sure I come back with a bigger appetite.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is a city that built itself upon gambling, partying, and booze. A land where men can take their bachelor for one final hurrah and enjoy their final moments before the chains of marriage tie them to a small home in the suburbs with a van in the carport. When that opportunity arises to bring that man for a True \"man's experience\" nothing says it better that a crafted cocktail and a slab of meat. If you happen to be in Vegas, stray away from the strip and stop by Del Frisco.   Del Frisco may not be among the most celebrated steakhouses and to be perfectly blunt, not one of the places I had ever heard previously, but it is True to its concept with the wood paneled walls, the grandiose chandeliers, and the starched white linen tablecloths to greet you. It's tables aren't amongst the most widely spaced, nor is it the quietest, but it certainly was comfortable and enjoyable for our group.  The menu is your typical steakhouse fare with al selection of appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts filled with the classics you would come to expect. Nothing truly standing out, yet nothing missing from what you would expect. Our group started with the shrimp cocktail served with its 3 sauces: cocktail, italian, and mustard remoulade. All were decent, but nothing all that spectacular. The crab cakes lived up to its name with a very high proportion of crab and very little filler. Its cajun lobster sauce that accompanied it truly showcased the flavors of the crab.  I opted for the 22oz bone-in ribeye and it was well seasoned and cooked beautifully to order. The flavors of the beef were highlighted and not overwhelmed by the butter flavors used in cooking and I have to say that while it arrived overwhelming, it was quickly consumed by this writer. In fact, he ended up eating half of his mother's filet mignon because it was simple, but that good.  The sides available to order had high and low moments. From the lackluster chateau potatoes that were ok but overall unimpressive to the spinach supreme which was well seasoned and nicely cooked, it almost seemed that the only thing you should order is the steak. Then the lobster mac and cheese arrived and a new chapter was written. The earth stood still as the first bite hit my taste buds and took my breath away. It was a beautiful creamy symphony of the lobster and cheese flavors set amidst beautifully cooked pasta. You could almost see the smile of God at that moment.  Food arrived in a well-timed orchestration and allowed for us to rest between courses and the servers were quick to serve in classic format that was quite impressive for a party our size. The waiter was incredibly patient and clearly well-versed in their menu and wine list which was pretty impressive.  Price was rather reasonable (even though I was a guest and didn't have to pay) when you look at other classic steakhouses. Wines are a tad on the steeper side, but it is a steakhouse and the pricing wasn't that bad in that sense.   When it comes to a need for a steak in Vegas, skip the $7.99 bargain deal and celebrate your friend's last moments of single-hood with a scotch and a fantastic steak that makes you really feel like a man.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is that of a typical American steakhouse with large portions, where side dishes tend to outshine entrees. It's a solid choice for a classic steakhouse, but if your focus is the beef, there is better to be had elsewhere in town. The meat may be good, but lacks the intense beefy flavor of other meat-centric spots that have their own aging program (or source from others that do). If prime is all you need, this place will hit the mark. If you're looking for the best dry-aged or wagyu you'll need to look elsewhere.  It was a long meal that took much longer than it should have. Luckily I was in good company. My wife and I (along with out son) were celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was nice of the staff to acknowledge the occasion when we checked in and when we were seated. It was also a nice touch when they presented a card from the staff. At the end of the meal the lemon cake was complimentary. It was a good experience throughout for the most part, but there were enough misses or lowpoints that made it less than perfect.  Steaks are pretty good and side dishes will steal the show. The creamed corn was plenty creamy with bits of bacon sprinkled throughout. The potatoes au gratin were my favorite side dish. Large chunks of potatoes filled the dish, accompanied by lots of ham, bacon, and cheese, making it rich and delicious. The True highlight, however, was the crab cake appetizer. By far it was the best crab cake I've had in town. Little to no filler, seasoned just enough to compliment the sweetness of the meat, and a cajun sauce that added a slight tinge of heat and depth.The low point of the night was trying their steak tartare. It was basically minced meat with very little seasoning. It's in the running for one of the worst dishes I've had.   Despite that awful appetizer, it was a good night. The company, obviously, was top notch, as was the service. And, there were enough good dishes to make this an enjoyable dining experience.",

I ordered off of restaurant week which was $68. Not bad for a killer 12oz rib eye, 2 sides (potatoes and green beens) Caesar salad and bread pudding dessert.   All i can say was the food was so fresh, crisp and came out searing hot and tasty that I was in food heaven. A nive touch when the steak comes out sizzling, that the server asks to cut it open and check the doneness. Mine was a bit rare for medium rare that they brought it back and it came back to me perfect. All the while with a smile on their face. A good night at a great steakhouse.",

The inside was cooked perfectly but the cut wasn't anything special.  Unfortunately the steak tasted a bit standard.  My friends steaks, on the other hand, came out much better.  NOTE -  My friend tried this same restaurant in NY he warned us they tend to under-cook the steak.  For example, a medium will probably come out medium-rare, a medium rare will come out rare, etc.  The same incident happened here as well; 2 members in our party ordered steaks medium and medium-rare, and both were under-cooked and came out medium rare and rare, respectively.  As such, both members in my party had to have their steaks re-heated.  Not a big deal but something to keep in mind.  Old Fashioned - $14 - Decent 3.5/5 I requested the old fashioned have a scorched twist.  The old fashioned was decent; it didn't come out sweet which is how I like it.  Unfortunately, I didn't think our server knew much about the drink.  The old fashioned came w/ a straw (usually it doesn't).  When my drink came the server scorched the twist right in front of me.  I found it odd the server scorched the twist (shouldn't this have been done by the bartender??), also she didn't scorch the twist properly.  The twist is supposed to be rubbed on the rim of the drink afterward (which it wasn't).  Complimentary bread-  Sesame bread.  Really good & soft.  Yummy 4/5.  Appetizers Lobster Mac n Cheese -Decent 3/5.5 Mushrooms Sauted - Decent, 3.5/5 Potatoes au Gratin - Best, 4/5  TIPS: -Corkage $50 (yikes) - steaks have been known to come out under-cooked (which is detailed above)",

    "text": "Same sentiments as William L. \"I just want my Vegas Del Frisco's back!\"  We went in on Sunday during the long weekend. The hostess brought us to our table with menus. A buser brought us our bread and water right away. Our server finally showed up after 10-15 minutes of sitting. He made up for it though by being thorough explaining the specials. I ended up changing my order to the special- filet mignon 3 ways (4oz each). He ended up being great overall.   Now the reason for the loss in two stars:  For one: there must be a new grill cook because he does not get the temperature right on the meat. I order my 3-ways medium well. The first 4oz I had was perfect...the next two 4oz was rare (light purple in the middle) but burnt on the outside. I returned it to have him butter-fly it but the cook made it into carne asada so I just gave up and ate it. Now two: We were looking around at the other tables and the servers,like we normally do. Noticed something very strange that was very not Del Frisco's. All the males had uniform attire nice shirt and tie, black slacks (not unusual there) yet majority of the female servers and female food runners were wearing shorts or plunging neckline tops or both. I get it we're in Vegas, but that is not appropriate attire for an upscale dining experience that Del Frisco's is known for. When we have come to Vegas...Del Frisco's has always had class, elegance, and delivers truly an amazing dining experience that you forget you're in (Sin City) Vegas!  The female manager that was there was dressed appropriately yet her associates were not. Sex does not have to sell food. Del Frisco's food sells itself!  It should be equal both genders should have a uniform and deliver great service.  Our server was great he took the time to explain, checked in sufficient amount, and gave great service as how it should be. All-in-all we want our Vegas Del Frisco's back!",

First the restaurant smells weird...you can listen to the piano music if you have table in the first room...the other rooms all you can hear is noise from people talking...no atmosphere at all. The bread and butter were so basic (you ll find better in mc Donald's) and the hostess that brings water was dressed up like a hoe...ultra short skirt and sexy tights  omg is this high end restaurant I thought?? The waitress was so self centered, making jokes and laughing by herself...like she wasn't there to serve us but her to have fun. The food was average. We had 32oz ribeye ...wasn't bad but I expected perfect steak for $100 for portion. (The waitress was convincing us that 32oz is not enough for one person)  . Overall if u want to spend some more money, and feel classy, get a decent service this is not the place you want to go. The price you will pay and the things you ll get there are not matching.",

Reservations were easy to get via OpenTable. We took a cab from our hotel Vdara which was about $15 or so and a 10 min cab ride.   Main: On Sundays they offer a prix fixed menu for $49: A choice of appetizer, entree and side. I chose the 9 ounce filet that was accompanied with a side of BBQ shrimp, Cesar salad and side of sauteed corn.   Sides: Mac and cheese and the whipped potatoes. The potatoes were excellent.   Dessert: We just had to get the lemon cake. It was HUGE! and soooo good. Not super sweet and not super lemon-y.   Tips: As for help in choosing the wine. The sommelier is super helpful and will work around your budget. Do not be afraid to ask for wines under $100. We did, and she chose us a really nice one that fit our price range.   A must go! Service is spot on. Food is excellent. GET THE CAKE! Be sure to come hungry and not hung over (that way you can enjoy everything!).",

We walked in to sit at the bar.  We were there for over 2 minutes without being greeted while the bartender chatted with another guest...fine...not the best service but we could move on.  The smell was horrendous!  The bar area smelled like mold and mildew.  I started to get nauseous just sitting there!    I can't comment on anything because I could not stand the smell of filth.  I can't image what was being served from behind the bar.",

James Bond table was cool too. Can't wait for a Miami location to open soon!",

    "text": "Wow. Just WOW.  I live in San Diego, so there's only a couple steakhouses that I've been to. But quote me on this. And I'm gonna say this loud and proud:  \"Ruth's Chris and Donovan's ain't got NOTHING on Del Frisco's.\"  So check it: I came here for dinner when I was in town on business. Everything was a plus. The place was nice. The hostess' were beautiful. The servers were professional. And the food was DElicious.  I had the filet mignon with a salad, and the table split a crab cake appetizer and lobster mac and cheese. YES, LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection.  Now I should remind you, steakhouses don't go cheap. Especially since  you're in Vegas. So go here on a SUPER special occasion, like if you're trying to impress a girl. Or go here like I did, on a business trip dinner where the company pays for it. =)  So in conclusion, Del Frisco's is the best steakhouse I've ever been to in my years of life. You have to go here at some point in your life. But be prepared to drop some serious cash!",

The lobster tail is cooked to perfection and literally melts in your mouth. We have ordered the steamed broccoli, asparagus, the potatoes and the Mac and cheese and have never been let down. We always start off with a VIP, which is pineapple that they have soaking in vodka, it's so delicious, it has just the perfect amount of sweet to offset the vodka. It's not overwhelming with sugar it's a perfect blend. For dessert we always order the creme brulee, and they flambe that sucker to perfection. Writing this review is giving my mouth a serious case of the wateries. The restaurant itself is classy and clean and the service has always been excellent.",

I would go as far to say that this is probably the best steakhouse I have ever been to.  The first time I went with a large group for a customer dinner and so we had a chance to try a bunch of the appetizers.  The most memorable one was the crab cakes and that was better than any of the ones I've had at other seafood restaurants.  Both times I ordered the New York strip, and they cooked it just right (I like medium-rare) and I love the fact that they cook it in butter, but that it arrives on the plate in such a way that I don't feel bad eating something I know I will regret from a health standpoint.    The service at Del Friscos is top notch; exactly what you would expect from a higher end establishment.  I had to wait about 1 hour even though I had a reservation so I was a bit disappointed but in rare instances like this one, the food made me forget about that.",

If you make a good steak you don't need the steak-sauce.  You don't need blue-cheese crumble or horseradish...  At Del Frisco's, if you order a rib-eye, that's what you're getting, a damn good steak!  Lightly hinted with seasoning (tastes like a garlic salt rub).  Highly reccomend:  -Bone-in Ribeye -Lobster mac -Cream Corn  I must admit that I haven't been back in a couple of years, not because of Del Frisco's but b/c I haven't been back to Vegas in a while.

My wife and I had the crab cake appetizer, which I would also highly recommend.  And the chocolate souffle cake finished off the meal perfectly.

It doesn't look like a whole lot from the outside but the inside is dimly lite and tastefully decorated.   And WOW did we eat! We had a bottle of wine gifted to our party and the drink selection beyond that was great and very broad.   The food was excellent. For an appetizer we had a large, cold seafood plate. I actually had fish for dinner as well, rather then steak and we had a lot of fabulous side dishes, including creamed spinach that I especially liked. I believe we also had a lemon cake of somesort which was really delicious as well.  The waitstaff makes it a point to know your name and when possible they try to get your business card so they can send you a HANDWRITTEN thank you note. Who doesn't love thank you notes!   If you're feeling like a hot shot in Vegas, go here. Your pocket may come out empty but you will come out full and extremely satisfied.",

And when I say packed, I am not kidding.  Their signature pineapple-infused vodka.  Good doesn't begin to describe this cocktail. The bread.  Yes, it's bread.  But it is everything bread should be.  And more.  Crab cake appetizer.  Best I've ever had without a breeze off the Atlantic blowing gently in my face. We were wished a happy anniversary and served without charge the lemon cake they're known for. The steaks.  Very, very good.  Perfect, in fact.  No children.  Not a one.    The minor irritations: We were seated right next to the kitchen.  I know, I know, SOMEONE has to sit there.  But Liz-the-bitch doesn't LIKE sitting next to the kitchen.  We were rushed.  No 'feeling rushed' about it.  We.  Were.  Rushed. We had to flag down our server and ask for after-dinner coffee.  WE HAD TO ASK FOR AFTER-DINNER COFFEE.  Huge fail.  That lemon cake?  Good, but you know, maybe we wanted to peruse the dessert menu  and perhaps make an additional choice. They lose a Liz-Star(TM) on that one.  I take my dessert very seriously.    Conclusion:  Good steakhouse.  Very good, actually.  The food was fabulous. The minor irritations listed above had everything to do with the fact that it was very crowded.  On a Thursday, by the way.  A restaurant with their reputation and their prices can and should do better regardless of how busy they are.",

We tried the Del's salad and Classic Caesar salad, my usual favorite. Del Frisco's Caesar salad left much to be desired, it lacked flavor and needed more dressing. On the other hand, the Del's salad, which came with two thick slices of bacon, was delicious.   For the entree, I enjoyed the crab cake more than I did the steak. The crab to filling ratio favored the crab more than the filling, it was the best crab cake I ever had. Why can't all places make their crab cakes this way? The filet was average, nothing out of the ordinary.  For sides, we tried the sauteed mushrooms and spinach supreme, both okay. We would've enjoyed the mushrooms more if they were sliced, rather than whole.  Their banana bread pudding was outstanding. Surprisingly, it was topped with local vanilla ice cream, which according to the waitress had a high fat content. Ice cream beats vanilla sauce any day. The bread pudding had a slight crisp to it and when mixed with the ice cream, was amazing. I would go back for the bread pudding alone.  The service was fantastic. It was the fastest I have ever seen someone clear our table at a Steakhouse.  Exceptional value for $99!!",

    "text": "Del Frisco's Las Vegas delivers not nearly the quality delivered of their Manhattan location, but they serve a great steak, tasty bread and good side dishes. Plus, the service is excellent.   I ordered the 12oz Filet Mignon and it was served basically as sushi...raw on the inside. I am not sure why they didn't butterfly the tall filet. Anyway, after the second try, the steak was still raw on the inside, so - to the restaurant's credit - the general manager visited our table with a new steak on the house. That action saved the night.   As for the side dishes (everything is a'la carte) the Caesar salad was wonderful with a light and tasty dressing, the onion rings were hot, flavorful and not greasy, and the lobster macaroni and cheese was good, though not my favorite dish in the first place. Their complimentary bread is fresh, hot, soft and flavorful. Even the valet out front raved about the bread.   Getting there requires a $20 cab ride from the Strip. During your 90-minute stay, be prepared for steep prices, dark lighting, great service and above average food. Trying to get back to the trip can take time due to the location, so plan ahead!  This was not the best steak I've had - even within the Del Frisco's locations - but it is a great place for a special occasion or a night on the town.",

It was late so he didn't want to send it back. Other than that, everything else as good.",

Is this a sports bar or a fine dining restaurant?  At their prices, I shouldn't have to endure network television.

We didn't really care what we had dinner wise...but their speciall was pretty enticing...$99 for a 3-course meal! You can't beat that! Had the filet and their crabcakes...which the bf also praised...it was one of the best he'd ever had..full of crab meat and not so bready like most other CC's...the steak was cooked to perfection and vegetables were tasty too!   one of the most memorable dinners ever!  =)",

While my experience there was limited by my single menu choice, the food was excellent, the staff friendly and attentive.   Initially, I had the opportunity to witness the management and staff interaction both at the function and with other customers, and later interact with some of them as well, as the event progressed, again, impressed with their focus on the patrons and food.  On a light note - generally known to be acutely aware of my surroundings, I did not have a clue that there was a live piano player there for some 15 minutes or so. I thought the smooth sounding songs were piped in, but far from it, live and upbeat.  The feel of the steak house was right on target in every dimension.  And the location is easily accesible on Paradise near Sands/Twain.",

It's off the strip and in its own free standing building, which is nice to get away from the casino crowds now and then.   I had the rib eye (no bone) and it was definitely one of the better. I'm not ready to give it a \"best\" rating, but it was damn good. What made the evening so fantastic was the service. Some steak places have the older guys in white coats and black pants that seem more rushed than attentive; our Del Frisco's waiter was very attentive, took time to talk us through our questions and let us enjoy our meal at a casual pace.   If you enjoy trying new steak places while in Vegas, definitely add Del Frisco's to the list.",

It seemed like the ticker cut allowed the outside to be crispier while keeping the medium inside. Wife's thinner cut and medium-rare inside didn't have the same crispy sear. Lobster mac, and creamed spinich were both excellent and came in large portions.    I personally didn't think the lemon cake everyone raves about was all that, but the rest of the table seemed to enjoy it til it's death.   5 stars because it was the best steak I've had in many years. Service was excellent as well.   They did show me the \"Bond\" table, but I was unimpressed.",

Came here with a group of girls and felt a little out of place walking in (as most of the diners seem to be guys), but us girls love our meat too!.      I tried the filet Mignon and the prime porter house steak.  I thought both were very delicious.  They were buttery soft that just melt  in your mouth.  What surprised me were the side dishes...even better than what I had expected.  The crab cakes and lobster mac n' cheese were the best I've ever had.  They are a definite must try!! The crab cakes were loaded with tons of crab meat and the sauce complement it so well.  As for the lobster mac n' cheese...I love the little chunks of lobster surprises in every bite.  Such a scrumptious creamy dish.  The lemon cake was awesome as well.   The service was spectacular.  Very friendly staff.  I swear we had like 5 waiters serving us.  Before bringing out our food we had people came by to clean the crumbs off our the table. Then, when it was time to serve our meal, they had like 5 waiters brought out our food so we would all be served at the same time.  I love that extra attention in their service.    I'd definitely come back again.",

Del Frisco's is known for a few items. 1. The VIP pineapple martini. House-made pineapple infused vodka makes the cocktail so fresh! 2. The crab cakes. 3. The lobster mac and cheese.  You have to get the lobster mac n cheese. And lastly, the Lemon cake. A tower of layer after layer of lemon and a lemon curd icing. How could you go wrong? The service is outstanding. We had Bradley and he was fabulous! He gave us just enough attention without being overbearing. Once we were seated we had or drinks within 5 minutes. 10 minutes we had out salads and 15 minutes later we had our entries. Mid way through our meal  Bradley asked if he could \"refresh\" my VIP martini (which means to re-shake over ice). I've never had a server ask to refresh anything of my meal. The best steak meal in Las Vegas without spending an arm and a leg. I would recommend Del Frisco's over any steak house in Las Vegas. Hands down the best!",

This dish was well cooked, filled with plenty of crab, swimming in a delicious brown sauce. I wished $22 dollars would get you two crab cakes, but unfortunately you only get one.  For dessert we got the lemon cake. The portion size is huuuuge! However, I thought it was overly sweet. I personally did not care much for it.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the customer service.

    "text": "I wanted to take my hubby to a nice steakhouse for his birthday weekend, and decided to go here due to the great yelp reviews.  I perused the menu prior to our arrival and while I'm not a big steak person, found there was plenty on the menu for me to choose from.  We arrived early and were seated right at our reservation time.  Soon after we were seated, we were given a loaf of a sesame seed covered bread and butter.  The bread was hot and very good.  I ordered a chopped salad that was the nightly special.  It was chopped iceberg lettuce, with green onions, bacon, tomatoes, avocado, cheddar cheese and a basil dressing.  It also came with bleu cheese which I left off.  It was okay - not great.  The cheddar was somewhat bitter and didn't really go with the other flavors in the salad.  My hubby had the famed crabcake appetizer.  He thought it was good, but not great.  For our meals he ordered the ribeye steak (medium rare), and I just got two sides.  I got the au gratin potatoes and asparagus.  His steak came out rare, so they put it back on to cook to medium rare.  He liked it, but there was nothing about it that stood out.  I tried a bite and it was good!  I did like the potatoes and was happy to bring the rest home to eat later.  The asparagus was well cooked.  Not at all tough as it can be.  Service - was good but not.  It took three requests for my hubby to get a glass of ice.  When our meals were brought, our server asked if we would like more bread, but it never came.  Our server kept asking if everything was amazing - it was good but not amazing and it made me feel uncomfortable to be asking that.  We were discussing the goods and bads and were wavering about whether to give a review of 3 or 4 stars, when they brought out a beautiful piece of lemon cake for his birthday.  It was huge!  The cake was the tipping point in our review,  We were seated near the James Bond room, which I had read about.  We enjoyed our meal.  I just didn't think it had anything that really distinguished it from Morton's, Ruth's Chris, or any other local excellent steakhouse with similar pricing.",

Went in, got bread, ate a loaf before we even got water to drink. Then, the lamb was extremely rare, steak was poor quality, lobster had NO fresh flavor. We ordered a $61 appetizer, seafood, eat the crabs with our hands and had to sit around and wait for clean hand towels. First set was dry, second set was dripping wet. Back to the beginning, we will never go back nor recommend this place. We still spent almost $400. A real disappointment. This is the second time we have ever left a restaurant to go eat at another.

When I came on my own, it was one of the best meals I had ever experienced in Las Vegas.  I started with a salad and the house mix drink.  I then had the filet which was cooked to perfection.  I ended with a lemon cake (apparently their specialty), to finish the outstanding meal.  Also included was a nice bottle of red wine, shared with some great company.  That visit alone was a five star worthy dining experience that would have been tough to beat.  And that review does not include the amazing James Bond table located in the restaurant that is a must see.  My second time at this restaurant, for a business event, included many appetizers and drinks.  The waitress, first off, was not as attentive as my first stay.  My drink took a while to get to me and when I ordered coffee it took abut 20 minutes to get a refill.  The appetizers were hit or miss as well.  The bruschetta, sushi, and lamb chop were very good, but the spring rolls and crab were not as great.  The mix drinks were as great as my first visit, however.  Overall, I believe Del Frsico's would average about 4 or 4.5 stars if I went there enough.  It is expensive but I will definitely be back to try their outstanding steak and mix drinks again if I want a great meal a little off the strip.",

For the price point I wasn't expecting to see something else on my plate other than food. Other than that the food was great, I got the steak medallions and my bf got a strip steak. Both of them had great flavor, however I felt as if each medallion was cooked differently, as I ate each one it got more and more raw. I eat my steaks medium rare so it didn't bother me much, other than the inconsistency. We also got their lobster mac n cheese as a side dish, nothing too spectacular but it was good. The best part we ha me was dessert, we got their butter cake! A must try if you go here, it will not disappoint!",

Cocktail waitress was partially professional - heard laughing at other tables, not well organized.and was happy to take my sons order for the Lobster and not even advise of the  nearly 90.00 price. Thanks for that. He didn't even eat it. Cocktails were watered down, inconsistent, glassware too large and not modern. It's time to put a beverage program together. It's 2017. Service was not well executed and both staff and volume were moderate at the time, so considered a miss.  Not sure of \"if\" or when I'm coming back for a 457.00 check with tip for a dinner for 3, 1 app, no dessert, 3 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails. Too many better places to go for that price.",

    "text": "No matter what I'll be a carnivore until the end.  Enter -- Del Friscos ... a steak lovers paradise.  ATMOSPHERE:  As many on here have said, its got that James Bond, Rat Pack, vintage vibe. Which when you think about it goes well with steak and scotch.  I love the live piano music, helps you unwind and just enjoy your meal. I've sat in many areas here, I'm not crazy about the back rooms, I rather be where the action is at, make reservations if you go on a Friday or weekend night.   FOOD:  This is why you go...for the food. First of all let me give Del Friscos props for the great seafood, always fresh, and always cooked just right. Lets start with the crab cakes, I've been to Maryland, these crab cakes remind me of the real deal, nice chunks of crab and served on a delicious creole like sauce. Lobster mashed potatoes!!! Lobster anything is good but oh my goodness, I would go back just to have this dish alone and I'd be fine. Seriously the best mashed potatoes in this city bar none. Steak, I stick to the 16 oz and 22 oz ribeye steaks... you really can't go wrong with any cut here. It comes down to two factors flavor and cooking. They cook the steaks just right here, but when you take that first bite your not just eating meat, the rub used on the steaks propel the steaks at Del Friscos into a league of their own. I mean I've had so many steaks here in Vegas, for some reason flavor lacks more than anything at most restaurants. But with a great steak should be a cocktail just as good, I recommend the Scottish Smash...you can be modest and get scotch or an old fashioned. My only complaint is that the drinks aren't consistent, some nights I can tell my cocktail was made in a rush. If you have a sweet tooth I recommend the chocolate souffle not too sweet and just the right consistency comes with a nice scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.   CUSTOMER SERVICE:  As you'd expect at a fine dining experience the customer service at Del Friscos is exceptional. I've never had to really ask for anything twice or sometimes ever at all. Staff is very friendly and welcomimg.  Four stars because there's an unpleasant smell in the restaurant, and thats part of the experience also drink consistency should be valued. My top pick for a great steak and nice night in Vegas.",

We also had crab cakes some of the best crab cakes I ever had. Now it's time for the cake....man was it on point. We had a few bites and put the forks down because we was full, but then the cake was calling my name....took a few more bites.... Had them wrap the rest to go. The cake was better the next day.",

Both were dripping cream and hard to swallow, I had to wash down my one bite with half glass of water. yuck!  $49 prix fix dinner includes a salad, 8oz filet with a choice of seafood, and a side.

When asking our drink order we implied that we would like to start off with soda water while we figure out whats for dinner and then will pick out a wine. She then asks if we would like sparkling, flat, or ice water, and then takes our glasses and wine list away. We thought maybe they just don't carry normal club soda.   The assistant comes by with VOSS sparkling water and then she comes by with two little bottles of soda water.... NOW, why would I want two different kinds?! She's so pretty... My favorite part was instead of apologizing or clearly understanding the situation she replies, \"to each their own.\" Kind of rude and strange that she chose that as her answer.  My other half then tries to stop and get her attention and she does the finger of \"give me a second,\" so she can clear off the table next to us who clearly weren't in a rush. The bartender acknowledges how adorable she is and comes over to assist us. After ordering some champagne and starters only half of our starters show up.. Tells us that's all she was told to put in.. PLEASE can you just own up to the mistakes already.  Anywho, aside from our model server and a few other \"mistakes\" the food was nothing short of phenomenal!! Do not skip out on their in-house pineapple vodka either! Om nom nom.",

    "text": "Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House was a recommendation by one of my managers. He insisted that this is a \"must try\" if I'm in the Las Vegas area.  I ended up having a business trip in Las Vegas a couple weeks back and the words \"double eagle\" popped up a few times. I decided to give it a try with my colleagues to see what it was all about. We made a reservation, walked in, and was amazed by the service and decor of the restaurant. This place was super high end. It was everything you would expect at a Vegas steakhouse.  We started our meal with the tuna tartare and a glass of wine each. The tartare was fresh and tasty, but nothing too amazing. The Pinot Noir that I got supplemented the tartare pretty well.  Now for the entree. We ordered the 45-day dry aged ribeye, the bone in ribeye, and the prime strip. When it came out, the portion looked bigger than expected. Each cut tasted amazing. The prime strip was dense and well seasoned. The meat quality was absolutely amazing. My bone-in ribeye was juicy and tender. I prefer a more fatty type of meat when choosing steaks. Out of the 3 steaks, my vote goes to the dry aged ribeye. That piece of meat was stacked with intense flavoring and was cooked to perfection. The extra 45-day aging gave it a rich and tender taste, unlike the other 2 cuts that we ordered.   By the end, we were stuffed. Our check came out to about $115 a person. Was the steak good? Hell yes! Was it worth $115? I would say no. I'm from Los Angeles and I know of quality steakhouses for half the price. If you want to have the Vegas experience, give this place a try.",

We were greeted upon arrival but had to wait for our table. People at bar were very loud and was praying not to be seated near that area. The hostess in the front seemed all over the place.  We ordered beef carpaccio for appetizer, rib eye for our entree with side of mash and creamed spinach. We both sent back our steaks coz it was cooked rare but we asked for medium rare. I wasn't impressed about the side dishes as well. Presentation looks ugly - it looks like they just slapped it on the plate. The waiter scooped mash potatoes into my plate with huge chuck of butter on it! Aiyayay!  In addition, we didn't know who was our waitress coz it kept changing!   Overall, we felt like they were all over the place and didn't have it all under control.   With so many steakhouses in the area, I'll prolly not come back here.",

I tried the Tomahawk, and I would say that is one very delicious piece of meat.  The sides were also great.  I gave this place a 5 star because the food and service was spectacular and amazing.  I was stuffed and just wanted more of the sides.  The tomahawk had a great flavor to it and my 3 cuts had a very diverse taste.  The Truffle Butter Sauce was great and definitely worth getting to put on your steak.  Since we also were celebrating my brother's birthday, we received a complimentary slice of lemon cake.  That cake was amazing and very tasteful.  Worth trying out, even if it is off the strip.",

    "text": "We visited Del Frisco's on our last visit to Las Vegas just after Christmas. We made reservations on line and arrived early to have a cocktail.  After a cocktail we were then seated for dinner.  Since my guy is an Executive Chef himself we knew what we wanted to order. We started off with a bottle of wine and were very pleased to see that they had an extensive wine list that included wine from the Valle de Guadalupe, Baja. We choose the Cascabel and were not disappointed. We ordered the dry aged rib eye, filet mignon and king crab legs.  Our server and wait staff were very attentive and took care of every need. As our dinner came to an end to our surprise we were brought out a slice of delicious lemon cake, \"compliments from the Chef\".  Then out came Executive Chef Guerrero to introduce himself to my Executive Chef Castillo.  What an honor, for Executive Chef Guerrero to take time out of his busy Friday evening to talk with us was beyond amazing.  We love Vegas and will return for dinner again soon.",

    "text": "We had dinner here with friends last Saturday. This restaurant came highly recommended by friends.  What was odd - we got a text from them before we even arrived, saying our table was ready and to please close out our tab in the bar??? I called them and said we weren't due there for another hour and we were not in the bar.  We arrived and were seated in a very loud dining room, and served by an enthusiastic, boisterous young woman. We started with wedge salads and Del salads and they were delicious but we waited what felt like too long to get them. Just as we were about to take our first bite, the manager came over to introduce himself and insisted on shaking each of our hands. He didn't seem to notice that we just got our food or that each of us was holding a fork in mid air waiting to take a bite, and he went on rather than moving on and letting us eat. His demeanor was awkward and the whole exchange was probably well intended but didn't hit the mark. My husband was very annoyed by it.   The porterhouse my friends had was very flavorful and perfectly prepared. I had the filet medallions and they were also tasty and cooked perfectly, but the side of mashed potatoes was stone cold. The side of au gratin potatoes we got for the table to share arrived cold in the middle and we sent them back. The new order came out and was also cold in the middle and the potatoes were under cooked and crunchy. The flavor was good, tho.  3 of us had perfect martinis and the coffee service was good. We enjoyed the bread pudding and butter cake desserts and they were awesome, we just about licked our plates.  I would come back and just have a different expectation. I thought for the price point it would be a fine dining experience, and it was just much more casual than that and there didn't seem to be fine dining attention to some of the details.",

Our server recommended the double bone in rib eye 45 days dry age. We ate at a lot of amazing steak restaurants in town and out of town. We were so excited. But when we got it,  It had no flavor. It was bland. SO DRY. No moisture. Not juicy at all. I had asked for medium rare. It was overcooked to a medium. Of course , we didn't want to make a scene because it was our dad's retirement. Disappointed we spent so much on a bad cut. It was dry and over cooked. The best was the lobster Mac and cheese and the the sphaghetti squash gratin. Service was good but their meat is not worth going back. Bad experience.",

My wife and I met up with some Friends here for restaurant week. I had the lobster bisque for starters and it was great. There was a lot of lobster meat on it. Again, the steak was great and the cheesecake for the dessert was amazing. Now the reasons for 4 stars instead of 5. I thought it was just me but all of  us at our table were hot. We would feel the a/c turn on periodically but it's safe to say we were uncomfortable the entire time. As for service, all the staff members were very pleasant. However, our dishes were missing something twice. I ordered my steak with truffle butter and that was missing until I had to remind the waiter. My wife's crab cakes were missing green beans while my friend's crab cakes had them. Attention to detail would've made this obvious. We also had to ask about the bread that all tables get while waiting for food. Aside from those issues, this place is great....just please turn the a/c on...",

    "text": "I'd been holding off on Del Frisco's for at least a year. It must be the highest rated  if not in all of Vegas, at least off the strip. I had a friend tell me about his experience at the one in NY and  trusted his word that I'd be coming in here to get some of the best meat around...  Their parking lot welcomes you before valet does, strange set of events. The steakhouse is classic in theme. You won't find any STK vibes here but rather 'pardon my reach' type service.   As for the wait, well I guess I'll never know because half of our party had already been seated. But service was all around attentive. Sides served onto your plate, the way it should be done. I was very impressed with how quickly your drinks (alc and no alc) are brought over too. Very high quality.  Food  Appetizers  Shanghai-Style Fried Calamari: You can taste the \"shanghai\" in this. A nice contemporary twist on the calamari. 4.25/5  Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes: The best crab cakes I've had up to date. They were so rich in flavor that they felt like a seafood dessert. Their cajun lobster sauce soaked in just perfect to add what it needed to add to it. 4.75/5  Tomahawk Chop: I was left unimpressed. It was cooked to the medium rare but I could not find the rich juicy flavor that is advertised with it. At the chew, it comes in nicely but that is the only spot where you can taste its quality. Tempting but I would opt for another cut. 2.75/5  For sides, I tried their mushrooms and onions, spinach, onion rings and baked potato. They were all delicious with the exception of the onion rings that were under fried and could still taste the batter with most bites. The mushrooms and onions along with the spinach were the most impressive.  It was an early dinner so I passed on drinks as stamina means all in Vegas.  I enjoyed my dinner at Del Frisco's. Even though the meat did not 'meat' my expectations everything else either met or surpassed them. They do have many other delicious cuts of meat that is forcing my future to include them in it.",

We always love to enjoy a nice new high-end Steakhouse in every city we visit this place was no difference and met all of our expectations",

We were 3 with no reservations in shorts and t-shirts (there's a dress code we didn't know about), and they let us eat at one of their cocktail tables. We had to wait quite a bit at the beginning because no one usually eats in the bar.  The hostess assigned us a waitress and we ordered wagyu carpaccio, fried octopus, potatoes au gratin(?), mashed potatoes, 2 prime strip and 1 prime rib eye (all 16 oz and dry aged for 45 days). We told her we were in a bit of a hurry because we had to catch our flight home soon and she made sure our orders would come to us ASAP which we really appreciated.  Everything was DELICIOUS :D Wagyu carpaccio was succulent and a very nice entree to open up our appetites. Fried octopus is what it is and they did it well. The veggies was a nice counter to the oiliness of the fried part. This was the first time I had dry aged steak and it was amazing! I had the prime rib at medium rare of course and the juices of that steak were delicious. I also ordered an old fashioned and it was very nice.  Wish we had time to order desert but we had to go to the airport. The cost of the meal was well worth it. The service was amazing and the food was even more amazing. I would recommend making a reservation before going, we were lucky the cocktail table was clearing up 10 mins after we came in.",

    "text": "We try to go to a steakhouse whenever we are in Las Vegas and this time we chose Del Frisco's. First we generally do not care for casino steakhouses because they are overpriced and do not have to cater to their customers, they can rely upon the casino customers to provide business. Del Frisco's was very impressive, great atmosphere, very helpful staff, uncrowded and subdued lighting (not dark but reduced). We each ordered a different steak and all of us were extremely please with our choices, the meat was prime and they were each cooked to perfection. Some say you can judge a steakhouse on their scalloped potatoes and if that is the standard then Del Frisco's gets 5 stars. Both our waiter and his assistant were very helpful with the wine list (over 1600 choices) and also with the dessert menu. Del Frisco's will definitely be on our list of places to return to on our next trip.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of friends on New Years Eve and we are happy to say we were pleased! We were on our way to Vegas for NYE and were debating on what new places to try. We wanted to try a steak restaurant. We did some Yelp searching and found Del Frisco's. We called to make reservations and were happy to have been able to book a reservation for 9:15 PM on NYE.   The restaurant is behind the strip. But honestly such a great location in my opinion. We didn't have to endure much traffic to get to the restaurant. The restaurant was beautiful, elegant, and definitely fancy. Come nicely dressed! You'd want to match the restaurant and occasion. Service that evening had it's ups and downs. Upon sitting down, our server did a great job at explaining the menu to us. After taking some time to look at the menu, we each decided on a steak and appetizers to share. I got the Prime Porterhouse Steak and Lobster Mac and Cheese. This was where the service started to slow down. It took a while for our food to come out. Probably about 20-25 minutes or so. But that was expected since it was NYE. Once our food arrived, the servers did a nice job at presenting each of our dishes to us. and once they were done, it was time to eat! The Prime Porterhouse Steak was delicious. It was nicely cut and deliciously tender. It was well-seasoned and wonderfully cooked with some pink! Just how I like it. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was also great. It's not your typical mac and cheese. It wasn't too creamy nor cheesy, and was evenly spread with Lobster. Great appetizer in my opinion. Both are highly recommended!! My friends ordered other appetizers such as the Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Pearled Onions, Thick-Cut Onion Rings, and Chateau Mashed Potatoes. The Sauteed Wild Mushrooms were really good. They were salty, but for some reason, really really good. The Thick-Cut Onions were huge! We were expecting something like the onion ring tower from Yardhouse. But these rings were ginormous! and not drowned in batter, thank goodness. But maybe they should have some kind of stuffing for filling, just a recommendation. The Chateau Mashed Potatoes were good. Greatly seasoned potatoes! All the steaks and appetizers came in very good portions. Don't let your eyes fool you. Everything was very fulfilling! We each split our steak with another person and shared our appetizers with one another. and woooo, we were stuffed! We even took some of our appetizers to go!  The Prime Porterhouse was 24 oz for $63. and the Lobster Mac and Cheese was $18.50. Great portions for the price, in my opinion.  We really enjoyed Del Frisco's and recommend it to everyone to come and try! Expect to spend a good amount of money because well, that's how Steak restaurants are. Paying for the quality. and in our experience, it was definitely there. We are glad to have tried Del Frisco's! Yay Vegas steakhouses!!",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House. We once again are participating in Restaurant week here in Las Vegas. We decided to dine off the strip this time and try a favorite of many and one that is on my bucket list. We arrived early for our 6pm reservation and only had to wait a small moment for us to be seated. We were given 3 menus. First was their regular menu, second was the restaurant week menu and third was a prix fix menu that they offer. On this occasion there were 4 of us in our party so there was a hope that many items would be tried. That was not the case entirely Josie ordered off the Restaurant week menu. She ordered the Del's salad which had a nice rich Avocado ranch and two glorious thick cuts of bacon on top. (BACON STRIPS!!!) Josie also ordered the 8 oz. filet with Mashed Potatoes. For dessert she ordered the Cheese Cake. Our friend ordered the same thing with the Lobster Bisque. Lobster Bisque was creamy and had lumps of fresh crab. I only had a taste but our friend enjoyed it to the last bite or drop. The filet was of good portion and perfectly cooked to a medium well for the two that ordered them. Mashed potatoes were excellent I had ordered them from off the house Prix Fix menu along with a Prime New York. This option was also 3 courses but did not offer a dessert. Since Josie ordered from her menu we shared her Cheese cake. More on that later. My new York prime strip was cooked a perfect Mid rare and was paired with a lump Crab Cake. So the mashed Potatoes are made with skin on, which I prefer. The had bits of celery and a bit of white pepper which added for me a great bite on the back of the tongue. The dessert Cheesecake was so velvet smooth on the pallet. It was not an ordinary cheesecake I have ever had. Each bite you could taste the cream cheese or slight sour note but not in a bad way.  Overall our meal was superb. Gavin was our server and he was st the ready and very attentive. I had a beer, Josie had Duckhorn Merlot and Terri had the VIP cocktail (two). She said they were quite tasty and we also had friends recommend it as well. I like a good beer with my steak. I should branch out. As I was saying service was great. Drinks refilled and nothing left wanting. Knowledge of Menu was also good.  We enjoyed the live piano music and even had a request that was fulfilled almost immediately. Nit sure if you can ask, but if you can ask to see the 007 table. I will add photos and video later.  Thank you for dining at Del Frisco's Double eagle Steak house. We will be returning and trying out more of the menu. They will be going through a renovation starting in July so we will have to delay a revisit a couple months. If you get a chance for the remainder of restaurant week please go and try the incredible food. Or just go there because. Call ahead because as I said they will be renovating soon.",

I will never return and will make sure that every personal and professional contact are aware of the awful service. I entertain clients 3-5 times a week and would be genuinely embarrassed if I brought them to this place restaurant . Shame on the management staff for completely dropping the ball.

    "text": "We enjoyed our dining experience here, but we have had better for less money, and DF is definitely a \"special occasion\" restaurant for us based on the prices. The service is welcoming, friendly and professional. On the Sunday they offer a prix fixe special which my wife chose; Caesar salad, filet mignon with a crab cake, and a side dish of asparagus. The Caesar salad was not prepared table-side and was served as whole leaves rather that the traditional pieces which we both prefer, but the dressing was tasty. The 8 oz. filet was very tender, but needed more flavor while the crab cake was very flavorful and very rich, and the asparagus fresh but too crunchy and underdone for our taste. I skipped a starter to focus on a dry-aged ribeye with a side of creamed corn. This was my first experience with a \"True\" dry-aged quality steak, and if that is what you are after, this is the place to try it! I found the flavor to truly stand out from the wet aged variety, and the meat texture was also denser, not tough just more dense from the loss of moisture during the aging process. Personally, I would go with the wet-aged in the future, but no complaints and I'm glad I tried it! The cream corn was excellent and we both enjoyed it, and both side-dishes are definitely shareable. We each enjoyed a glass of Decoy Merlot which was a perfect accompaniment to our steaks. We were full, but we were presented with a complementary dessert for our anniversary; chocolate lava cake and a rich butter cake, both with small scoops of ice cream. We ate a bit of the delicious cakes and all the ice cream then had the remaining cakes packed to go. The meal was definitely enjoyable and we left fully satisfied. I recommend this restaurant be on you short-list of steakhouses, and judge for yourself if the high prices are worth it to you!",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night for my buddy's bachelor party; he had hyped about this place for a while now, saying it's the bastion of the best scrumpdiddlyumptious steak he's ever had for the exuberant amount of coins he paid with.  Wasn't too super busy on a Saturday for a party of 8.  The decor inside was your standard steak house affair, elegant with a lot of carpet and wood along with a dimly lit place to make women look prettier than they actually are.    Got sat in the corner away from people, which is a plus for a bachelor's party since we do tend to get a bit loud and rowdy.  Server was on point with every questions about the menu and played along with the joke when asked about using canned corn for their creamed corn (said they grew it in the back, good one).  He checked on us frequently, made sure our drinks were full and see if there's anything else he can do to make our dining experience a good one.  Did notice they had attractive women bring out the main course, I wonder if that heightens our appetite and puts a bit of bias on the meat, since we're already aroused at the sight of lovely ladies bearing steaks.    Back to the steaks, we ordered four steaks and sides for eight people on a \"family style\" way, which I thought was awesome since I didn't know of any other steak house that did this, in fact, most will charge you a \"sharing fee\" for such action.  I picked the uber expensive Wagyu Tomahawk chop, porterhouse, rib eye and strip steak on a medium rare, as no good steak should be eaten beyond medium rare.    Not sure if their precious, secret \"salt\" is laced with meth or crack but man, these were some of the best steaks we ever had!  Tender, juicy, flavorful are understatement.  Even the toughest strip had juicy hint of tenderness to it.  Wagyu axe was clearly the winner while ribeye and porterhouse were marbled beyond expectation.  And the crust, did I tell you how excellent the salt/pepper/crack laced crust was?  It was perfectly crisped with a just the right amount of salt, or maybe too much?  Who knows, but we killed those steaks.  Definitely going to bring back my wife here and eat more chops.  Whether they made up the whole \"double eagle\" grading is mystery but these guys can call it whatever they want, triple turkey, quadruple hawk, these steaks are GREAT.",

    "text": "So we're in Vegas and celebrating my friend's birthday. She wanted something special for herself, steak, so Jessica got what she wanted.  Was very easy to make reservations, we actually had our hotel set up dinner reservations for two about 3 hours in advance, no problem.  It's about 5 no more than minutes drive from the strip.   My friend REALLY decided to treat herself and for appetizer we ordered the crab cakes to start. Ala carte, one very large crab cake shared between the two of us and it was creamy and moist and juicy and savory.   Next my friend ordered the caviar, I don't know which of the two choices but it was $185/oz! I personally would never but grateful I got to have a taste of fancy sturgeon caviar. It's so special, the spoon also has to be made of mother of pearl. My first time trying it, it was not what I expected. I was expecting it to be very fishy and oceany. Actually, eating by itself, it's only mildly \"fishy.\" Topped with sour cream and or egg yolks or egg whites and chives the blend of flavors are perfect together. Creamy, subtle, only mildly salty when you eat it with the buttered toast. Maybe once in your life you should try it.   For the main entree I ordered an 8 oz fillet mignon, medium rare with truffle butter. So tender, so juicy, cooked perfectly pink all the way through. So savory as well. Had to take home he extra because everything was so savory.  We also ordered a side of the aisle gratin. Fancy cheesy potatoes.   Birthday girl ordered the prime strip, 12oz medium rare as well. It honestly looked bigger than that.  For dessert, because it was her birthday we received a hugely generous complimentary lemon cake. And a adult delicious chocolatey bailey's creamish \"Adult\" milkshake for using the hotels concierge service.   But also for her birthday they wrote a nice little birthday card.   Everything was so good! So savory was not disappointed at all with the service and food. The staff were friendly and the food was above par.",

    "text": "Okay, one of the best steak houses I've eaten at!    I spent New Year's in Las Vegas and this was one of the places we went for dinner.  We were also seeing the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One after dinner so being in a slight rush, we were hoping they would be able to get our food out in time because we had to be seated by 6:45 pm at the Mandalay Resort.  Once we told them this, the serving staff were all very accommodating and stressed that they would put a rush on things.    I made a reservation through Open Table for 5:00 and they happen to open right at 5:00. Since we got there a little earlier so as not to miss our show, we had a few minutes wait before they could seat us so we waited at the bar. I ordered a VIP Martini which is their signature drink. Very refreshing indeed!  We were finally seated and my friend and I each ordered the Prime Strip which was 16 ounces (1 lb.) of delicious aged beef.  We were first served some great bread and butter.  I also had the Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which was really nice, big and filling.  Along with the steak, we ordered sides of the sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with almonds.  Both were really delicious but I couldn't eat very much of it because I was getting really full from the steak which I was intent on finishing.  It was my main goal since I didn't want it to go waste and the besides the fact that it tasted so darn good, so tender with the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection, scrumptious!!  We asked the server how they prepared it and she told us so now I can hopefully replicate it at home sometime.  It'll probably won't be the same however because it never is when you try to do it at home.  I enjoyed the dinner immensely do I will definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas when I want a  steak because they do it up right here.  They have a nice decor with dark woods making the ambiance really comfortable and inviting.  If you're looking for a good steak house, I highly recommend coming to Del Frisco's because you won't be disappointed in the food or service.",

We shared the Del Frisco salad to start and enjoyed the crisp bacon on top of the salad along with the dressing. We shared the prime rib with the Del Frisco potatoes. The prime rib melted in our mouths and the truffles and cheese on the potatoes were to die for. As if this wasn't enough they surprised my guy with a birthday plate of dessert. The molten chocolate cake was decadently good and the bread pudding was the star of the desserts. We were super happy and full. Left promising to return.",

Yes, there is an odd smell in the entrance vestibule. It is more of an earthy smell. Getting past that to the rest of the place reveals unpretentious yet high-class decor.  Our server was great (maybe she spoke too fast about the specials). Our service was almost perfect (we shouldn't have had to ask for our bottle of wine after having ordered it. We started our steak without it.). But those are picayune details. The food was simply great. The steak (prime in bone) was dreamy. I hadn't had a steak in a year. I can still taste it and smell it. We didn't have any special sauce (butter, etc) on it. One steak was perfect for both of us. We had lobster mashed potatoes (special that night) and a salad and some veggies. Very friendly service. Great quality meat. We shared a lot of dishes so our bill was reasonable.  All in all, this was a great way for me to get my once-a-year steak fix. This 99% vegan couple gives a double thumbs up.",

Anything and everything that isn't Mastro's is hard to impress me.   Service: our server was great! Super nice and attentive. He did try to upsell us a lot of things but it's part of his job but it was a bit much.   Bread: sesame bread loaf. Simple. Plain. Good thought. Hot. Fluffy... But plain for this type of place.   Salad: Caesar Salad is amazing. The dressing is garlicky but super good. We also had their house special chopped salad with a basil dressing and avocado and shredded cheese. Amazing!   Steak: Got the filet trip that came Bruno style with scallops, Oscar style with crab, and a filet with a slice of Brie. Scallop wasn't seared well. It was plain. Almost undercooked. The black truffle oil was super delicious! Crab was good.   Sides: lobster Mac and cheese. AMAZING. SUPER GOOD. SUPER CREAMY! amazing! Sweet yams.... Are you serious?!?!? These are so GOOOOODDD!!!   Overall, it was good. But like I said I'm ruined for life.",

    "text": "My second visit to Del Frisco's, only a few months apart. I was super satisfied on my first visit, and I wanted to come back and tackle on the 32 ounce Wagyu steak.   I learned my lesson last time by ordering all these appetizers, so I skipped it this time just so I can focus on the steak. And that Wagyu steak can deliver!!! Overall, a great experience, but I had a slightly better affinity to the 22 ounce bone in rib eye on my last visit.  At $90 a plate, the Wagyu steak is one of those where you can order once in your life, be satisfied, then go back to your favorite. Don't get me wrong, still a great steak and I will definitely come back to Del's, but I'll probably go back to the rib eye or try another steak.  I still devoured that steak, minus the bone, it came to about 26 ounces of meat. And I went for their lemon cake. That cake was so moist. My server this time was Tinae. She was superb and I wish her well on her school and studies.  They said that they're opening up a Del's in Santa Monica. I'll be one of the first to visit that place and order me their finest steaks.",

    "text": "Amazing steaks and even better customer service without the inflated prices of steakhouses on the Strip!  Del Frisco's ranks up there as one of my favorite steak houses anywhere!  My friends and I did a side-by-side comparison of the 22oz Bone-In Prime Ribeye ($56) and the off menu 32 oz \" American Wagyu\" Long Bone Ribeye ($90).  Both were excellent and came out a perfect medium rare.  So much glorious beefy flavor I could hardly contain my excitement!  The flavor and quality was very similar to the bone-in ribeye at Mastro's which is my all time favorite steak.  Honestly though, I could not tell the difference between the Wagyu and the regular bone-in ribeye.  The Wagyu was supposed to be more marbled, more tender, more flavorful-- hence the higher price tag.  But if not for the Wagyu having that ridiculously long bone, I would have never tasted a difference.  Unless you have money to burn, I would recommend just sticking to the regular ribeye and saving some money.  I can't say enough about the customer service.  Everyone from the girl who took the reservation, to the hostess, to the servers were all super friendly.  Our waiter in particular was very knowledgeable about the menu, from the steak, to the seafood to the booze.  Their blitzkrieg method of bringing everyone food all at once is awesome.  There were literally 4 people at our small table cleaning up plates and dropping off food all in one fast fell swoop.  And speaking of booze, I highly recommend the VIP, a pineapple infused vodka cocktail.  Delicious and refreshing.  Get a pitcher because you're gonna want more than just one.  The only part of Del Frisco's that disappointed me was the sides.  We got garlic mash, sauteed mushrooms, and creamed corn.  They were all acceptable, but nothing really stood out.  Mastro's has their black truffle gnochi.  Lawry's has their creamed corn.  I think Del Frisco's lacks a signature irresistible side dish.  This is probably the only thing that prevents this from being a True 5 star review.  4.5 stars rounded up!",

Chase is the best bartender! He's the handsome one with they greyish hair. He's super helpful and knowledgeable, and friendly.   It was my birthday when I went yesterday, and they were so so accommodating to me. The piano player even played happy birthday and sang!! They comped one of my drinks and even gave me their lemon cake on the house! I got the steak salad on happy hour. Perfectly dressed and seasoned. The beef was phenomenal. The other two people I was with got fresh east coast oysters, the shrimp taster app, and a burger and fries. Everything was cooked perfectly. The bread is also excellent!   The only reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is for the cocktails I tried. I got a couple mixed on the menu and they honestly weren't my favorite. It seemed like each one didn't really taste like what the menu described. The paloma one tadted like cough syrup and vicks. But hey. To each their own.   Love this place! Can't wait to come back for a steak.",

Bar: Bartender was nice and made strong drinks  he advised us to get the crab cakes ( we did and it was bomb, note that it comes as one, so order one for each person .... it's that good ).  Table/ambience:   very romantic !  Only thing was off was when we walked in it smelled like old people   Service: Freaking excellent.  Best service I ever had in my life.  I been to a lot of high end restaurants and this place puts them to shame.  We were helped by Joseph, he was on point.  He made good suggestions and was very knowledgeable on the menu.  Food: We shared the Tomahawk which was recommended and it was hella good!!!   We also had the crab cake for appetizer   For sides we had the creamy spinach, lobster Mac and cheese and the mushroom something.  All good,  next time we will try the onion rings and prolly pass on the spinach (gotta make sacrifices somewhere)  Joseph waived our dessert you the man bro! It was the chocolate souffle and was delicious.  We will come again with my wife's family next time their in town as they like fine dining ( used to go to Silverado, Andiron, echo rig ) but this place blows those out of the water.  If they moved to Summerlin I'd be in trouble",

Additional sides of lobster Mac and au gratin potato's were really good. The Del salad and crab cakes to start was both excellent.  I liked the fact that there was no attitude from the wait staff that we were just water drinkers who liked ketchup with our onion rings .",

I just don't understand. This place is not good. When I go out to eat...especially at a place this expensive I expect spectacular food. Something I can't cook at home. And this was gross. I got the Ceasar salad which the dressing is pure runny mayonnaise. No taste at all. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly but guys, this meat is meat you can buy at Costco. I'm not joking. And my steak wasn't seared or anything. Just cooked. Looked nuked. And the lobster Mac and cheese....I swear to you it has no taste. It's very very creamy but it's so watered down with the cream you don't get the taste of cheese at all. I was so disappointed in the food. Trust me go somewhere else. No bueno",

If review was based on them it would be 5 stars.   Started with crab cake (delicious) and shrimp cocktail (meh). For entree I had bone in ribeye and lobster tail and she had filet mignon with sauteed spinach. Her filet was ok but everything else was just too salty...I drank so much water cuz of saltiness they refilled about 5 times. I really wanted to like it cuz medium rare was made perfectly. The lobster was nothing special and still costed $84. Complimentary bday desert was good and appreciated. All in all I paid $360 including tip for this dinner and I really don't feel it's worth the price.   Also their Yelp page says attire is dressy but we saw couple people in there with shorts and some with regular t-shirts on so really not sure about dress code if they have one.   To the staff, thank u guys for being super awesome!!! This review is not about guys",

    "text": "Having Lived in Vegas for a few years back in the Mid 90's and spending many a weekend here too many to count over the years, I tend to simply Check into my Hotel of choice avoid the hectic strip, taxi's, etc and dine in my hotel or within walking distance of another Hotel. Having to meet a friend of mine for dinner outside the hotel didn't originally appeal to me, but he insisted on Going to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House off Paradise / Flamingo here in Las Vegas.  So 8PM off I head in my taxi and low and behold, as I'm approaching the restaurant my phone rings and my dinner buddy has an emergency at home and won't be joining me.  Well what to do at this point, hell I was already in the parking lot I'm having dinner and BOY AM I HAPPY I DID!  Arrived to a well appointed old style Steak house with white table cloths rich mahogany, a nice large bar that had live piano music and vocals (Always a plus). I decide to dine at the bar and was greeted by Trisha who proceeded to explain the various specials, options etc.  Being solo at this point I kept it simple.  Trish recommended the house cabernet which was produced specifically for Del Frisco's Vegas.  A very nice Napa cab, big, rich, chunky and tasty. $14.95 for a very generous pour.  (NICE)  Chopped Salad to start accompanied by nice Hot home baked bread and sweet whipped butter. Very nice salad, cold lettuce just the right amount of dressing, very tasty.  Being from NJ originally bread outside of the Garden State tends to leave you wanting more, and in this case there is no exception to the rule. Good but certainly nothing to write home about.   Moving on to the main battle Royal was the 26 ounce Double Eagle NY Strip on the Bone which is their signature dish ($59.95- Regular 16 oz strip $39.95). Requested \"Charred Medium rare plus\".  Trish also recommended the Garlic whipped mashed potatoes with skins left on mixed with chives.  Let me just stop right here and tell you perhaps one of the top 3 NY Strips I've ever had in my life and I've had many.  Tough to remember them all but this was a mountain of meat, cooked to absolute perfection on a very hot plate that allowed the red portion to cook to perfect temperature.     Not too much bone and the taste was incredible. Perfect amount of charred and it needed no salt, pepper nothing it was in word PERFECT.   The Potatoes (9.95) where the perfect accoutrement and unfortunately dining alone I wished I could have split another side,  perhaps a lobster tail, vegetable etc, but as it was I was so stuffed I couldn't even move when I completed this perfect meal but there is always next time.  I declined desert, hopped a taxi back to my hotel and can state without hesitation this is a MUST VISIT for anyone in Las Vegas locals or others. The staff was friendly, attentive, the piano music / vocals fantastic and a great touch and Trisha at the bar is an absolute sweetheart, thanks again JERSEY GIRL!  Put this one on you don't miss list you won't be disappointed.",

We started at Tom Colicchio's at the MGM and were surprised by how bad their service was. We were both servers in our past lives and know when someone is doing a good job. Your servers were amazing! Service was prompt and courteous. We were never wanting for anything and the service was never overbearing... it was an experience every person would want at a restaurant. The steaks and shellfish we ordered were all perfect and offered more selection than we expected. We were pessimistic about going because we know you are a chain and we thrive on unique experiences... but i have to say, I will always hold Del Frisco's as my first choice when dining out from now on. Thank you so much.",

The waitress asked me to cut the steak to check if the steak was cooked okay. We ordered lobster mac and cheese, it was alright or maybe I am not a big fan of Mac and cheese lol but my boyfriend said it was okay too. It was over rated.

Service was pleasant and attentive, but always seemed to be going for the upsell which was fine but should have toned down once she realized the type of things we were interested in.  The disappointing part for me is that there are a few different rooms at the restaurant - some more boisterous, some quieter, and one with a live musician.  We were seated in a quieter room which was nice since it was just my husband and I, however the decor was fairly bland and outdated with a grayish wall paper and mirrors.  We had made a reservation several days in advance, so we weren't \"overflow.\"  The ambiance of the meal made me feel like I was in a more casual steak house, rather than one that serves some of the best meat in town.  With steaks that are $40-$50 (not including sides), I expect a bit more in the ambiance department.",

What might be an unexpected surprise, though, is the Prix Fixe menu that delivers some of the most popular dishes (in my case, 8 oz filet, crab cake, wedge salad, and smashed potatoes) for about half the price of the regular menu.  That makes it a deal.  Also a pleasant surprise was the wait staff, which was not only helpful, but also anxious to swap life stories and chat about any topic.  Given the lengthy conversation, the quick service can only be explained by the fact that we had three waiters and a manager hovering around us during the course of the dinner.  Having just overpaid for wet ice cubes at a strip nightclub, I was also very pleased that the drinks were a fair pour and reasonably priced.  The atmosphere was what I think of as \"old Vegas\" (even though this is a Dallas-based chain).  Dark wood, lighting and noise levels appropriate for romantic conversation, and generous spacing between tables.  Easy to reach on the Paradise Rd. version of restaurant row, I would recommend this place over many of the pricey steakhouses at the Strip hotels.",

I have to admit, I am usually a bit skeptical of chains - especially since we live in a city of top-notch steakhouses - but I was very impressed with the food! I was there for a friend's graduation dinner, so we had a private room in the back which made it easy to give toasts, etc.  We arrived a little late, so we missed trying the appetizers, but everyone said they were good! I tried the house salad, which had a really yummy avocado dressing, and also the Caesar, which was standard but good. I ordered the Ribeye steak and it was very very tasty! The rub on it had a LOT of salt and pepper, which might be a problem for some people, but I loved it. They asked us all to cut into our steaks before the waiters left so they could fix any problems, but there didn't seem to be any. Even my husband, who likes his steak cold rare, was happy:) The desserts I tried were fine (cheesecake and chocolate mousse), but I would skip them next time - nothing special.  Overall, I can't say I think Del Frisco's is as good as some of the places on the strip (I love CraftSteak at MGM and STK at the cosmo) but it certainly holds its own and I would definitely go back.",

Chopped salad (off menu) was awesome. CRAB CAKES are the best. Their pineapple house martini was delicious as well.   I liked everything except the desserts: lemon cake and bread pudding! PASS! Much better other places.  So skip that.  Good food here!",

I ordered the rib eye and when my steak came out it was clearly a strip steak. I asked the waiter if he is sure it is Rib eye?!?! He was very nice and offered to change it. The manager came and after trying to convince me over and over that it was a rib eye, agreed that they had made a mistake and it was indeed not a rib eye. 20 minutes later when my wife was done eating my steak came out. They make everyone cut the steak in half to make sure it was cooked to their liking but a real steak house would never do that! It makes the steak cold!! I know good steak from growing up in New York and going to the best steak houses there that known all over the world. This place is off the strip. I found it on yelp because of the great reviews but I'm not a fan!",

Then the Chef came out in a huff, he had butterflied the meat which had shrunk to nothing it was overcooked and inedible, I didn't complain further as I was with a client, BUT, They did nothing to correct it or replace it. I would never go back or recommend this place simply on their guest service. There are many other great steak house options available in Vegas...",

    "text": "Had  reservations and was sat on time. I have been a big fan of Del Friscos other locations in NYC and Orlando. I am local and have eaten here before, probably 2 1/2 years ago. This particular visit was less than stellar. The fried oyster appitizer was very small. In Orlando and NYC which I ate at a couple years ago, the oysters were in abundance and falling off the plate. I don't know if slow times have caused them to cut back at this location? Calamari appetizer was ok, nothing to write home about. Now on to the main course. The prime ribeye we both ordered was for Medium. It came out still very red in the middle, was medium rare. We sent it baxck to be cooked up a little bit. Then when they brought it back out, it ended up being Medium well. We were hungry and didn't say anything. Steak was still good, just not the temperature we wanted.  For a class of steakhouse like Del Frisco's, typically a manager would have come out and stop by the table when food is sent back. Even at Outback Steakhouse a manager will come by the table when food is sent back to the kitchen. No manager ever came by. Obviously bad service there, perhaps we woudl have mentioned that the steak was now overcooked. It was very visibly light pink to brown center. The creme spinach side used to be piled high, once again, don;t know if the economy is hurting this locatation but the serving portion that typically serves 2 comfortably, left us unsatisfied. And at $12.50 for spinach, this was actually insulting.   End result, we will probably not come back here agian next time we want steak. The service and quality fo food has gone down. Could it have been just a bad experience on this particular visit? Sure, but too many thinsg were different from our last visit to make us want to come back again. And in Vegas folks, there is no lack of excellent steakhouses. I however will go back to the one in NYC and Orlando, just never again in Vegas. our server was good at least. Mastros Ocean Club in the Cystals shopping center is much better. Been there twice and both consistant good service and food quality and portions for the money. I would refer them 1st over Del Frisco's.",

In retrospect I knew I should have stayed away from the tasting menu as I know I am not a \"noshing\" kind of guy and I like the big portions and a full size steak.  Service was good given the place was pretty busy...BUT attention to detail was very much lacking.  We called ahead to ensure there was a good non-alc sparkling wine for my pregnant significant other who is normally a wine connoisseur (when not with child).  When we called ahead to attempt to bring in our own bottle they said they had some NA Sparkling Champagne...when we get there they whip out a freaking bottle of Martinellis Cider????  Another person in our party was the smart one and got a steak a la carte - bone in rib eye which was juicy and perfectly seasoned.  I got the Pri Fix Rib Eye which was disappointing...looked like a cut of steak you can get from Vons in the family pack.  Crab cake was good-right amount of crab (Blue) to binding portion.  Again small bite on the tasting menu, was sooo tempted to get a full order.  My general rule is to try a place more than once before ruling it out, so the crab cake was definitely enough to bring me back for another try at their Steak.",

Do not, under any circumstances drink more than five raspberry vodkas mixed with Sprite before having dinner here. For the love of God. Yet, I'm still giving it five stars.  The service is absolutely astounding. Especially when there are Vegas drunkards left and right and the servers still treat you like you're being perfectly appropriate in a classy place like this, even though you're talking about all sorts of unsavory things and the three dudes at the table next to you are trying to court a not so high class call girl. Ahhhh, Vegas.  Now, here's where those raspberry vodkas come into play. I really, really, really wish I had been drinking beer earlier or at least waited until dinner to drink because I definitely would have been able to finish more than 1/4 of my steak without feeling sick. Alas, I could not, but I did chow down on the amazing mac and cheese - you must order that here.  I know this is quite the bossy review, but listen to me, dammit. It's the truth.  Thumbs Up: -Gigantic servings. -Amazing service from a staff that must have the patience of saints. -Gooooooey mac and cheese.  Thumbs Down: -Breaking the rules I outlined. -My poor empty wallet after dinner.",

It took us sometime to get seated even if we made reservations but we did request for a private room.    While waiting we sat at the bar.  There was someone playing the piano who took requests - hello Billy Joel songs!   You also need to check out their James Bond table.  It will suddenly open and play songs from the movie.  It also has wine that is etched w/ the different James Bond movies.  Once we were seated, service was fast and good.  The B and I shared a porterhouse and crab legs.  I like my steak w/ bone and medium rare.  Our steak came medium but the server was quick to get us a new piece of steak when we complained.   The steak was coated in a seasoning of spices w/ lots of pepper.  It was really good!  Perfectly seared outside and rare inside.  Delish!  The crab legs were really good too.  We also ordered Oysters (west coast) - I like the sweeter variety. They were also superb.  Did I mention the sesame bread that comes before the meal?  It was served warm as any good restaurant should and w/ whipped butter - I think it was sweet cream butter.  This one takes the cake. Lobster Mac and Cheese!  You have to get it.  It's the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my whole life.  I will come back anytime.",

    "text": "If this was the first balla steakhouse I had ever been to, I would have been impressed.  The table was ready after a brief minute.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  One guy pointed me to the restroom (which is somewhat hard to find), the guy in the can itself was cool and the waiter put up very well with the complete nonsense from our resident smart-ass in our group even though he was wearing a baseball hat to a dressy restaurant.  Overall ambience is great if you like old school style steakhouses (stuff you would expect in Chicago or New York mafia type places).  I like how the restaurant is sectioned off into different rooms so the place does not get too loud (a real problem at Flemings Newport Beach and Manhattan Beach).  Wine selection.  You can spend as much as you want here.  You could spend the GDP of a small country.  I would say the by the glass selection was smallish and was not too impressive on the \"bargain\" end of the menu.  I am sure that you could find a good bottle or two if you know your wines, but I am not that good.  My impression is that it is overpriced for the quality of wine.   Food.  Ribeye steaks are what you would expect from a good restaurant.  However, if you are not from LA, you will think that your steak is overdone with respect to how you ordered it.  I like mine medium rare, but it was a bit closer to medium.  It was still pretty decent with the Foie gras infused sauce.  The sides were acceptable, but not that impressive.  We had mac and cheese (seemed a bit too al dente), broccoli (a bit over steamed) and sauteed mushrooms (good, but I could actually replicate very easily at home).  We didn't have dessert because it was mostly dudes.  Since the website won't tell you the pricing, I will give you an idea (I have to go on memory since it was hosted dinner.  Thanks host!)  Ribeye 16 oz  $40 Ribeye bone in 22 oz $50 Carpetbagger (Ribeye 10oz) $30 Wine (pinot from Argentina? I forgot the name... Madderas?) $90 a bottle Penfold's Cab (don't ask me the vintage!)  $10 a glass Silver Oak (Alexander Valley, 98 I think) $40 a glass Most wines by the glass were $15 Wedge salad $10 Most appetizers (other than market price stuff) were about $10 - $15  Anyway, it really depends on what you are looking for and what your expectations are.  If you are from New York and you have been to the top steakhouses, you will hate this place and knock over a table.  But, if you are from LA, you might feel right at home.  I am from LA, but I appreciate how the old school steakhouses of New York and Chicago roll.  I went to Jack Rose in New York and Smith and Wollensky's in Chicago.  They definitely are not shy about giving you a slightly seared hunk of prime beef.  My kind of style.  Besides, I have had raw beef, horse, liver, fish and eggs, so really it's no big deal to me.  A few of other notes.  It is pretty good to go in groups (we had 8 and they had a nice large table we could all sit at, instead of pushing tables together).  The restaurant pretty much cleared out around 10:30pm or so (we had 9pm reservations, the place was pretty busy when we first got there).  If you want a quieter evening, go for a very late dinner.  Be paitent if you are cabbing it over here.  It took a bit for cabs to arrive even though we told them a few minutes before we left.  Just have a stogie or whatever and hopefully it isn't the middle of the winter or summer so you aren't freezing or boiling.",

Nice glass of Napa cab at a fair price and they even had my favorite desert--a Vintage Port (with a generous pour).  Highly recommend.

We made an 8:30 reservation, waited till 9:05 and still not sat, nor were we approached about the unnecessary wait considering we had a \"reservation\". The hostess staff is completely clueless, and worthless.   Kept telling us \"a couple more minutes\" when clearly that ran out awhile back.  I appreciate honesty, and truth.  You can't control the course of the night, but can tell a guest when they are clearly 45mins from being sat.  Otherwise, management needs to be re-evaluated.  The restaurant gets one star only because the bartender was amazing and sensed we were annoyed and did what he could to keep us interested.  Only heard wonderful words about their steaks, but will not return to Confirm because it is RUDE to not honor your guests reservations.  I don't care how good your steak is, it's garbage if the experience before or after is subpar.",

    "text": "This is the place to go for a fantastic steak dinner in Las Vegas. I was unfamiliar with Del Frisco's before my last trip to Las Vegas. That merely led to a series of happy surprises as the staff and the food at Del Frisco's kept exceeding my expectations over the course of a night.  A local booked a reservation for about sixteen for a Saturday night. I arrived uncharacteristically early, so I sat down with the wine list, which could have occupied me for the entire weekend. A wine steward asked if I had any questions, and we talked a bit about a Central Coast Cabernet from a vineyard I had visited. Many (most?) wine stewards would have tried to talk me into something pricier, but the gentleman treated me as if I had selected something thirty-times pricier. Yes, they have wine that was thirty-times pricier than what I ordered... and I ordered a bottle, not a box. If you're a wine snob with a bankroll, you'll see a dozen once-in-a-lifetime wines.  Eventually our party arrived, and we were seated in a semi-private dining room. Another party about our size shared the room. We each had two or three tables full of people. Our servers were attentive without a hint of arrogance. When some people ordered their steak medium-rare, they explained what that would actually mean, and some decided to go for medium instead. (You and I are better than that, though. You're going to follow my lead and get a big fillet, medium-rare, and savor it with a nice Cabernet, aren't you?)  For some reason, my dining companions preferred mixed drinks to wine. I only had one martini before dinner, and it was bracing and a fine palate cleanser.  The sides can be served family style. You'd have to really like brocolli or asparagus to finish them. Finishing a literally-mountainous order of onion rings on your own would be impossible.  But you're here for the steak. And it does not disappoint. The filet mignon comes in two sizes. I don't think I've had a better steak anywhere. If you're into fancy sauces or deconstructed preparation, you might want something besides the fillet, as it is simply a perfectly prepared fillet. If that's too straightforward for you to enjoy, then my advice is useless. If your mouth has been watering while reading this paragraph, then there's nothing more to say.",

We started at N9NE in the Palms, moved to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grille at Ceaser's and wrapped up with Del Frisco's.   I thought N9NE was going to be hard to beat, but Del Frisco's is in a whole different class.  Far and away the best of our trip and the best steakhouse I've been to.  A few recommendations...  If you're having wine with dinner, ask for Steve Quenzer, the Sommelier.  We gave him a price range, our plans for dinner and turned him loose.  He hit the wine out of the park every time we asked his advice and really made our dinner experience.  If you get the opportunity to try a Saxum wine, don't pass it up.  As far as the food, two words.... Kobe Beef!  Worth every penny, and yes its quite a few of them.  Hands down the best steak I've ever had.  Simply fantastic.  Sides are ala carte, as you'd expect in a fine chop house, and all were outstanding.  Don't skip the Mac-n-cheese.  Finally, I really have to give a tip of the hat to the manager Jacque Viloria.  She was kind enough to take 3 guys from So Cal on a tour of the restaurant and their impressive wine cellar, even though it was a busy Saturday night.  She was friendly, approachable and a key part of a perfect dinner.  She obviously knows the importance of customer service and runs a first class operation.  And, if you're really nice, she might even show you what's under the \"Do Not Touch\" table. ;)  Desserts; bread pudding, HUGE lemon cake, a fantastic chocolate cake, fine French wine, mmmmm...  Oh, and don't forget the cigar room and port.  What a dinner experience!  Del Frisco's is #2 of my top 10 dinners, and will be will be on my must see list every time I find my way to Vegas.  Enjoy.",

Steaks and sides are excellent. Service level has really dropped over the years - most of the waiters and bus boys are not trained properly so don't expect 5 star service. The patio is a favorite place to end the night with a cigar.",

After cutting that part out, the remainder was not well seasoned, far from the tastiest steak I've had  Sidenote/another downside: - table of 10+ who'd clearly pre-partied before ordering more drinks at the restaurant. Odd that a rowdy table would be placed in the same room as 6 couples; the restaurant is big enough to separate the partiers from the cupcakers. I feel the waitstaff allowed them to be loud & obnoxious because they didn't want to jeopardize the large tip coming from a large bill. Makes me laugh when 41-year olds try to party like 21-year olds...y'all gon' feel that in the morning!!!",

Our table was in one of the smaller rooms so lots of privacy.  Had the shrimp cocktail & the crab cakes - all were delicious and well prepared.  Then the steaks came - hmmmm !!! Perfection! All of us ordered the bone in ribeye!! Delicious and it's unfortunate we were not able to finish it. Our sides included mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and asparagus. All was well prepared. We were stuffed from our appetizers and sides and didn't have a chance to fully appreciate our perfect steak,  I had a few cocktails and they were all good! We didn't have room for dessert .  I highly suggest all to try this when in Vegas.  I will have to when in Vegas again.",

Wine, steak, potatoes, and good company are all the right ingredients to make a soul happy.   I ordered a 6 oz filet, which was a nice portion and cooked to perfection. Juicy, flavorful (a little too flavorful on the crust but delicious nonetheless), tender, and literally melts in your mouth. The lobster mac n cheese was BOMB. Chunky pieces of meat and savory, creamy goodness. The potato au gratin was also very good; can't really go wrong with meat and potatoes.   The bill came out to ~$70/person, which wasn't bad at all considering all the wine and sides we ordered for a party of 20+.  It's a little ways off the strip but a WINNER in my book. Highly recommend.",

I am a very very picky steak eater, I love steak and am pretty hard to impress.  but, the steak here impressed me. I honestly forgot what I got since it was a while ago but I remember it being amazing, I do remember that I added the peppercorn extra for a few dollars and it was totally worth it. cooked and marinated perfectly, steak melted in my mouth!  the sides on the other hand were not so amazing, the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and the corn tasted like it was from a frozen bag BUT the point is this is a steakhouse so you come for the steak, not the sides (or that disgusting wine I got) I wanted to try some new wine so I asked for a recommendation and they were very helpful (can't fault the service for how the wine tastes right?) but the wine they suggested tasted like cough syrup! :(,   but keep in my with my disappointment in the wine and sides.. I still give it 5 stars? that's how good the steak was.. service was amazing as well! definitely will be coming back when I'm in vegas :)",

This wine list is staggering and its always nice to have a service that can help you pick based on your preferences. I started with the Crab Cake-this is a must have if you like crab. Then to the best 16 oz Ribeye I've had in a restaurant. I was medium rare throughout, edge to edge. For a side I had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, while not the best I've had, it was good. My wife had the Filet Medallion Entree.  This comes with the sides already paired, Chateau Potatoes and Thin Green Beans.  Again the Filet's were cooked properly. Potatoes were, well potatoes, what else is there to say on that.  Green beans were a little under cooked for our taste.  We like a snap but still cooked through. These were close to eating them raw out of the garden. Either while waiting for you meal or after the meal make sure to ask for the tour of the James Bond Table.  Would go well in any wine lovers home.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a little \"babymoon\" getaway to Vegas from San Diego. Prior to our trip, I told him that aside from a prenatal massage, all I wanted was a really good steak dinner.  We have passed this restaurant several times on previous Vegas trips, while walking to Firefly restaurant... and for whatever reason it has always caught my eye and I've wanted to try it out.  Before our weekend getaway, I checked out some Yelp reviews and booked a reservation on Open Table. When I booked our reservation there was a section for any notes and I made a comment that my husband and I were celebrating our babymoon.  When we arrived at dinner - there was a \"Congratulations\" card signed by the staff, which I thought was a really nice personal touch!  Here is a little description of what we had:  Cocktails - Well let's be honest, mine was a \"mocktail.\" I am usually a big fan of mules and I really like the taste of ginger beer. So I was happy to see a version of that on their menu. Theirs is made with bourbon and had blackberries in it. I asked the waitress if the bartender could make an non-alcoholic version.... and it was perfection!!! On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised that I was only charged for the ginger beer, $4.50 I think. I have been to other restaurants where they will still charge the full cost of the cocktail, even though you are ordering it without alcohol. I thought this was a nice gesture. My husband ordered a beer, and if I remember correctly it was only $5.50. I think that's a steal at a nice restaurant.  Appetizer - We got the crab cakes and they were delicious! Large chunks of crab, just the way it should be.  The sauce on the plate was so good, that when we were done with the crab cakes, I used the bread to soak up that yummy sauce!  Entree - My husband and I split the Tomahawk Rib Eye. This was $90 and definitely worth it, especially since it fed us both. We ordered it medium rare (anything else is just not right) and the majority of the meat was perfectly cooked. However there were a few small areas that were definitely more on the rare side. My husband did not mind eating those bites, and I didn't mind letting him. The steak was well seasoned and incredibly flavorful.  We both really enjoyed it!  Dessert - So we definitely didn't have room for dessert, but I considered getting something to take back to our hotel.  Well what do you know - the waitress comes by with a giant slice of their lemon cake... complimentary for our babymoon celebration.  I thought that was so awesome of them to acknowledge that and give us dessert! We ate a few bites at the restaurant, and boxed up the rest to bring back to the hotel.  The slice of cake was so big, that we ate it little by little over the course of the next 3 days! Good thing we had a fridge in our room.  The cake was moist (I hate that word - but it really was moist) and lemony without being super sweet or sour. It really was just right and a nice touch to compliment everything else I loved about our meal.  A few days after we got home from our trip to Vegas, we actually received a HAND WRITTEN THANK YOU NOTE from our server. WHAT????!!! Never in my dining experience has this ever happened. This is so above and beyond and truly is exceptional customer service.  I will definitely return in the future. Thank you Del Frisco's for a fantastic meal and incredible service!",

We had an issue with the wrong crab appetizer being sent out and a different waiter (not the one who took our order) coming back to the table and basically arguing with us about it.  We ordered a cold crab cocktail and they sent out a cooked crab cake.  He then insisted to my wife that's what she ordered and then he brings back a menu and makes her point out  the item on the menu that she ordered.  Sitting here a few days later and thinking about it, it still irks me that he did that to her.    Didn't know why he had to be that confrontational about it, he could have just said no problem and taken care of it.   Ordered a ribeye medium and had to send it back because it was cold and raw in the middle.  Little bit of a bummer waiting for my steak while everyone else was enjoying theirs.   The appetizer issue really put a damper on the night,  I was hoping that management would have stepped up with an apology.   Nothing like Boston Del frisco's we always go to.  That place is top notch.",

When we arrived we where told that the TV's are not turned on and will not be turned on. We eventually ate outside in a park bench setting. We wanted white table cloth not picnic bench-setting.   Food was average not top notch. Not sure if there is new ownership.   I brought my group to Del Frisco raving about the great steaks.  I was embarrassed at the end of the night.",

We started our meal with martinis all of them were excellent. We were even given a sampler of the VIP martini and ended up indulging on the second round. For appetizer we had the crab cakes in lobster sauce...oh my a seafood delicacy. We also had the wedge salad that was fresh. Now the actually meal was pure perfection from the bone-in rib eyes to the salmon. Both were savory and delicious. All the sides were flavorful.   Lastly we had the lemon cake, melted in your mouth. Mmm!!!   Thanks to the crew especially our server Kim and the wine manager for making our experience unforgettable.",

    "text": "Best steakhouse in Vegas! Spent my 24th wedding anniversary here. From the moment we walked in to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. The filet mignon was best. The prime strip and sea bass were excellent. Cooked to perfection. They even asked us to cut our steak and verify if it is cooked to our liking. The gift lemon cake was outstanding. Will definitely come back here when we visit again. We have tried the other steakhouses in Vegas, this is best.",

    "text": "I had no idea what I was getting into the first time I dined here. I mean, I knew it was a steak house, but didn't have any expectations.  When I arrived, my friend wasn't there yet, so the hostess invited me to have a drink at the bar while I waited. There was a gentleman playing the piano and singing. I ordered a drink. The bartender was very personable. He told stories, gave recommendations, and sang.  Finally, I went back to the hostess stand to be seated at my table. Shortly thereafter, my friend showed up. We ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (the reason why we had decided to eat here). I had the Del's Salad, the Handcut Filet, and the Cheesecake with strawberry topping.  The salad was amazingly different. It was topped with two strips of bacon and an avocado dressing. Altogether, it was delicious, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite so I only ate about half of it. When my filet arrived, we were asked to cut into it to make sure it was cooked to my liking. It was. The meat was so soft and seasoned to perfection. It was the best steak I had had in a very long time. The dessert was on point as well. To be up front, I'm not the big of a sweets person, but this cheesecake was to die for! It was light and not dense, and not too sweet either like how some frozen cheesecakes taste. This one felt as though it was homemade from scratch. I also need to rave about their banana bread pudding that my friend ordered. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of banana flavored things. But this was easily one of the best bread puddings ever. It was perfectly soft and sweet and the banana wasn't too overpowering.  Our server did accidentally charged us for three people instead of two, but he quickly fixed this error.   Del Frisco's was SO GOOD, I went back to eat there again the following week. I would easily recommend this steak house to ANY ONE living in or visiting Las Vegas.  Also, if you do go, ask to see the James Bond table! Super cool AND the girls know everything about it!",

    "text": "Food was certainly good while the service and atmosphere were as should be expected. For that reason I just can't give it the full rating - for the name (reputation) and price-point everything is simply what you'd expect. There was nothing that 'wows' or really makes Del Frisco's stand out.  Update: had to drop a notch when I found the server had added an extra $10 to the tip charge. Even if it was a mistake it still shows the average quality of service.   Looking for great food, deep wine selection, and the ability to share that you've eaten at a Vegas high-end restaurant? Great choice.   Looking for that over-the-top restaurant, a unique experience, or the feeling of walking away from a meal with your money very well spent. Not here.  James Bond display was neat to see but hard to see the over million dollar price tag. Best seen in person.",

The wine list was a bit overpriced but it's Vegas. One star off for mediocre service. We had to ask for water 3 times and bread twice. At this price point? Surprising. Then at the end of the meal, they charged us a second time for our drinks at the bar from before dinner. They kinda apologized but it took them 10 minutes to sort the bill out.

Can you imagine the pain i felt when i asked for it and the waiter said we are OUT of it at this time? Are you serious? A top notch steakhouse should NEVER be out of anything and especially on a saturday night.. I had to settle for a bone-in ribeye which was good but NOT a wagyu. The VIP cocktails were excellent which is vodka infused with pineapple for $14 bucks each! We even met a nice couple who offered me and my date another round which was awesome. We had a crab cake not cakes, you only get 1 for $20 dollars. Also the lobster mac and cheese which was great and the Maque Choux Corn also very good! The ribeye was nice and tender, but not a tomahawk damnit!! Truffle and bone marrow butter are EXTRA ($6-$7 dollars) They have a guy on the piano all night who is just killing it! He is a great musician. They have a big parking lot for self park and VIP park service. The bar area is wonderful with a piano guy playing. The dining rooms are very nice and clean I just wish they had the wagyu, so sad!! =(",

He found this place through Yelp and with its exceptional reviews, he made reservations for two to wine and dine the evening we arrived. Needless to say, the food and service was beyond our expectations.  Our waiter was extremely attentive and detailed - very knowledgable with the menu items. The ambience was romantic and relaxed - perfect place for a nice fine dining exerience out of town. But the highlight of the night were the steaks....so amazingly well-cooked and flavoursome, some of the best we've ever eaten! My prime rib and his filet mignon were cooked exactly the way we specified - medium rare. In fact, they would have you cut down the middle of your steak to ensure it was cooked just the way you liked. The meat was so tender and moist; I swore it melted in your mouth. Especially my prime rib, every bite bursted with such a juicy flavor that I didn't want to stop chewing! ahhh...so delicious, so satisfying.   The tuna tartare made me want to lick the plate. We also had 2 loaves of their fresh baked bread that they direct you to pull apart instead of slicing with a knife. It was so warm, so fluffly, soooo goood. With a glass of the Double Eagle Cabernet each, we definitely had the perfect dinner.",

The cold seafood platter was also ok.  Nothing to write home about.  ~$50 or so.  The steaks were a-ok.  The petite filet was a little dry; the ribeye was cooked to perfection and much warmer and juicier and tastier.  The Caesar salad was great - whole spears of romaine lettuce with plenty of tasty dressing.  The prix fix dinner was ~$50 and includes small meat portion, salad/soup, and a side.  The ribeye set me back about $50 or so.  I was celebrating an anniversary and they comp-ed me a slice of lemon cake.  According to the receipt, the slice runs ~$11.  Totally not worth the money.  So glad I didn't have to pay for it.  Other important info: located in business park, many private dining spaces, classic wood paneling throughout (reminds me of old school private clubs), fantastic service, and they mentioned they're opening a location in Santa Monica where Boa Steakhouse used to be.",

We started with Cesar salad then we each had the bone in ribeye, potatoes with cheese & bacon and lobster mac & cheese.   Caesar salad was good. We shared it and it was a good size. Lobster mac & cheese was also good.   Steak: For a $55 steak we expected it to be tender.  If you are looking for a good steak I would recommend Mastro's ( which literally melts in your mouth ). That is the place to go! It's hard for other steak houses to have good steak & sides when they have Mastro's to compare it to... Mastro's just sets the bar too high, which makes places like this hard to give more stars.  Potatoes were hard. Would not recommended them.  They gave bread with dinner - nothing special about it.   They gave us a complimentary lemon cake for his birthday which was yummy. I'm giving 3 stars because the food was ok, a bit over priced. The staff was friendly. I would recommend it if you are in the area for dessert. We will never return for dinner.  One time is good enough ;)",

I would definitely recommend making dinner reservations as they were completely booked for the night we were there.  Even though we made reservations ahead of time, we still had to wait 30 minutes before we were seated. However we were entertained with live piano music during our wait which was enjoyable.    Of course we did our research on yelp and ordered the crab cakes and calamari.  The crab cakes were delish! Ruth Chris use to be my fave for crab cakes, but not anymore! The cakes were packed with an ample amount of crabs that tasted sweet and delicate to the tongue. I found the calamari to be mediocre; nothing spectacular about it. I probably wouldn't order it again next time. I ordered the fillet mignon and my fiance ordered the rib eye.  The fillet mignon was great, but WOW, their rib eye is scrumptious!! Aged to perfection providing the perfect taste when grilled to medium rare. We also enjoyed their sauteed mushrooms; I think it pairs well with steak.   I would highly recommend this place for anyone seeking a fulfilling steak dinner.  You can't go wrong with this place!",

    "text": "Had an amazing experience trying Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House. My husband and I decided to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary at this establishment. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance with a beautiful dining room and full bar. There was also someone playing piano which gave it a touch of class. We were promptly seated and greeted by our waitress Jen. She was one of the nicest and most informative server's we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Jen was extremely nice and explained the menu in great detail, and answered all of our questions. She wished us a Happy Anniversary, and made us feel right at home with this being our first visit.   We started with two cocktails. I had a very good margarita on the rocks, and my husband had a blackberry cocktail with fresh muddled blackberries, bourbon, crushed mint and ginger beer. Delicious!. We followed that with an appetizer of Steak Tar tare. It was very good and quite spicy, served with a side of garlic bread. Then on to the entrees. I had the 16 oz. Australian cold water lobster tail served with hot drawn butter. I also got a side of truffle butter which was excellent with the lobster, but even better with the amazing steak I'm about to describe next. My husband ordered the best steak either one of us have ever had. It's not on the menu. Granted it isn't cheap. $90 dollars! But if you like steak, do yourself a favor and try it once. It is a 32oz bone in Wagyu sirloin cut. It has an amazing marbling content and aged to create a flavor that is indescribable. The steak comes out cooked perfectly and was out of this world delicious. It was so big that even with 2 of us sharing it we still had leftovers. As a side dish we had the creamed spinach with bacon pieces. A nice compliment to the entrees. As a very nice touch, Tony surprised us with a complimentary piece of there 7 layer lemon ice cake, with a candle lit for our anniversary. A very nice touch to end a wonderful evening.                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a place to spend a special evening no matter what the occasion, give Del Frisco's a try. The food is delicious and the staff is beyond friendly, informative, and very professional. We also signed up to be on their email list, which entitles you to special offers, and future discounts. Just an incredible restaurant to spend a special evening!!   Then to top it off. A few days later we received a nice hand written card by our wonderful servers thanking us for our visit. Have never had anyone go the extra mile like that. A very professional establishment that cares about their customers and want you to have a great experience and keep you as a repeat customer.",

Excellent ribeye, perfectly seasoned; crab cake was excellent (not deep-fried, so you really get the crab flavors coming through), lobster mac n' cheese was quite good (generous with the lobster, which is nice) and lemon cake was quality (still don't know how we fit that in our stomachs.)  Quality service- loved the staff-signed \"happy anniversary\" card we were presented with (as well as the label from our bottle of wine.)    Got crab cake for free with promotion- sign up for their club, get a free appetizer (and they comped the lemon cake too, as it was our anniversary.)  Price-wise, it's pretty reasonable- we saw far more expensive joints on the Strip with worse reviews.  You can walk here from the Strip pretty easily if you like- a bit ghetto past Koval, but within a mile of Flamingo area.  And yeah, see that James Bond table.  I almost came, it was that exciting and cool.  (hyperbole for dramatic effect)",

We all ordered drinks and they were definitely not watered down, but be prepared to pay a premium for your drinks.  They also have an excellent wine list, but being from the Bay Area I can't justify $60 for a bottle of Wente.  For starters we had the steak tartare which was perfectly seasoned and served alongside hard boiled eggs.  For dinner we all decided to have tomahawk chops.  The tomahawk is a great value at $90 and they allowed us to split the steaks.  They served the chops on sizzling plates with warm butter.  For sides we ordered the brussel sprouts with bacon and the creamed corn.  I would've preferred my brussel sprouts roasted, but they prepared it sauteed here.  It was ok, but I would personally just stick to the creamed spinach and corn next time.  We were full and skipped dessert, but everything was excellent.  We will be visiting Peter Luger's in Brooklyn, NY so it will be an interesting basis for comparison.",

The rib eye was cooked to a medium rare as ordered, had great marbling, and was season well.  The lobster mac and cheese was rich and had large chunks of lobster.  The overall food experience was excellent.  Atmosphere of the restaurant is very classy and great for business meals and date nights.  The service was fantastic.  The servers are very knowledgeable of the menu items and wine list.  They are very, very attentive, but not overbearing in any way.  The overall experience was great.",

The meat is supposed to be prime grade but this steak had very little marbling, I've bought better at Costco. My wife had a 14oz. lobster tail which was dry and meally. Very disappointing meal. Save your money and try somewhere else",

    "text": "Del Frisco's serves up, as far as I'm concerned, the best steak dinner in town. I'm very familiar with most of the other good steakhouses in Vegas - Charlie Palmer's, Joe's, BOA, etc -, and while they all serve a fine steak, Del Frisco's manages to outdo them nearly all the time.  Food: The porterhouse is the best I've ever had, and it never fails. Very tender, flavorful, and all around a great cut. The Double Eagle has always been a bit of a let down to me, but maybe it's just shamed by the porterhouse. The filet mignon is also excellent, and very tender, but not that much better than the competition. The sides & appetizers are also great. The calamari is excellent. Very tender, and not overly breaded. Mushrooms and creamed spinach are great side dishes, but their \"signature\" macaroni & cheese doesn't do much for me.  I enjoy the chopped salad, but it's not as exceptional as the steaks. Desert wise, I always get the chocolate mousse, and can definitely recommend it - but how hard is it make a good mousse?   Service is usually impeccable. Staff is very friendly, and food is delivered promptly. We arrived late once for a reservation, at about 10:30pm (closing time is 11), and they sat us without batting an eyelash and never made us feel rushed, even as we lounged around far past closing.  Ambience is nice, but not particularly extraordinary. A little more business than luxury, but I really can't complain. You don't have to put too much effort into dressing up, but it's definitely not a t-shirt and shorts kind of place (Although I did show up in shorts once & they didn't give me a hard time). One downside is that due to the oppressive Nevada smoking laws they've had to disallow cigar smoking - even in the cigar lounge! There used to be no better way to spend a evening in Vegas, but what can you do.",

    "text": "I go to Vegas once a month, and I hate to give away the spots that only locals know about . . .    You see, tourists love Delmonico's, which masks its semi-flavorful steaks with a potpourri of spices.  Tourists love N9NE, which I would NEVER, ever, ever visit again. N9NE overcooked our steaks and refused to replace them.  Have you ever heard of anything like that???  Me neither.  Finally, tourists love whatever steakhouse the magazine in their hotel room tells them to love.   If you want a real Las Vegas steakhouse, and you don't want to go to Morton's or Ruth's Chris, may I recommend Del Frisco's.  Located a couple of blocks off the Strip, it's hidden from the glamor and grandeur of touristy Las Vegas.  Cab ride to Del Frisco's from, say, New York, New York, won't set you back more than $7-8.  We had reservations for 9 pm (it was Final Four weekend, and we wanted to finish watching the game).  The games ended early, and we arrived at 8:45 pm.  We were seated very quickly; so quickly, that we hardly had a chance to grab some jelly beans and some golf tees from two giant bowls by the entrance.  Remember, jelly beans are edible, but golf tees are NOT.  You've been warned.  The steak is great here.  I ordered the Double Eagle New York Strip, a 26 oz cut on the bone.  It arrived quickly, big and juicy as promised.  The meat had just the right amount of marbling, and was prepared properly.  The waiter then encouraged my friend and I to cut our steaks to make sure they were prepared to our liking.  Are you listening, Mr. CEO of Morton's?  It's a wonderful idea, and it certainly adds to the entire experience.    To be fair, I'd like to give Del Frisco's a 4.5 star rating.  I think I have to deduct half a point for mediocre sides and salads.  The lettuce wedge with blue cheese was very ordinary.  Both sides that our waiter recommended, special mac 'n' cheese and potatoes au gratin were not nearly as good as advertised.    But then again, it's kind of expected of a steakhouse.  Sides are just filler anyway.  Speaking of filler, the bread they give you is very good, too.  Fill up on bread and meat, and go easy on the sides.  Oh yeah, it's a classy place, so no flip flops or sweatpants.  Jeans are OK as long as you wear a polo, a sweater or a button down shirt.  Leave your faded \"Beat Duke\" t-shirts, your sequined \"I love Vegas\" hats and your replica Mickey Mantle jerseys at home.  I'd say, if you want a good steak in Vegas, call Del Frisco's.  They only accept reservations over the phone.",

I'm happy to report that the meal was considerably better than the last time I was here, and the service was attentive and charming, but Del Frisco's is still not one of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas. Particularly since their prices are not much less than the superstar joints on the strip.  The wine list is full of great choices, but the mark-up is about 3 times. And I'm told they won't allow corkage for any price, which is just plain stupid.  The lobster mac-n-cheese was a little watery and there are still no fries on the menu.  So next time I'm planning to drop fat dough on beef protein, I'll likely pick another place....maybe something that rhymes with \"fat dough\" and starts with an M.",

    "text": "In one word: fabulous.   Now for the long version: We started out with the VIP (for vodka-infused pineapple) martinis. They're as delicious as they are refreshing.  The menu suggests you let the waiter know how you'd like your meal to be paced. For example, they'll get you your meal faster if you're headed to a show. Dining at Del Frisco's was our event for the evening; we were in no hurry.   This was a good thing, as we felt no pressure while we munched on the oven-warm bread and perused the considerable wine list and menu. I was pleased that the menu listed potatoes prepared in a variety of properly calorie-laden ways, all under the heading of \"vegetables.\" Clearly, Del Frisco's understands the carnivore spirit!    Litha ordered the crab cake and said it was better than any she'd ever had. I (as part of my duty to you, dear reader) gave it the taste test and found it spicy, dramatic and delicious. Worth noting: the crab cake isn't battered and deep-fried as so many are; rather, it contains generous chunks of real crab that actually tastes like crab.   I had the steak tartare. It's not something you see very often, and you shouldn't order it unless you know what it is. I knew what to expect flavor-wise, but was surprised by the size (HUGE) of the tender and flavorful treat.   Finally, the main event: she had the seared Ahi tuna, I had their signature \"Double Eagle\" steak, with sides of scalloped potatoes and asparagus.   There was a minor issue with the asparagus -- someone forgot to serve it. When I asked a roving employee about it, it was like watching a well-oiled machine spring into action. Before Emeril could say \"BAM\" out was coming an order of asparagus, headed straight to our table...  ...where it was headed off by our server, who knew we'd ordered the asparagus \"naked\" with the sauce on the side. Honestly, I have no idea how their kitchen turns expedited orders around so quickly but a (back to Emeril) BAM later and our perfectly prepared asparagus was on the table.   We did our best with the entrees and had them take the plates away. We took a break between courses, and watched the show going on around us. The staff, again operating smoothly and efficiently, turned tables within just a few minutes - no looking at dirty linens for us.   There was one unsightly visage, however.  Being that this is Vegas, in this fine steak house, a customer dressed as a trailer-park refugee chowed down directly across from us in his very best ball cap, t-shirt, shorts and sandals. Ugh.   The only solution to the visual blight was to order after dinner drinks and coffee from Del Frisco's extensive offerings (including some nice port wines). Since we were celebrating a birthday, they surprised with a comped lemon cake (light, tart, tasty).   A fabulous dinner, but we were stuffed beyond redemption. After managing to make it back to our hotel to change clothes, we took a loooong walk down the Las Vegas strip. Needed!  The final pleasant surprise came a week or so later after we'd returned home to Long Beach and got a personal, handwritten note from our server thanking us (see <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Falturl.com%2Fohr6&s=c75ea83dd987ff0445a9b3ff13b26bf0b9a3cc22ab6157b865e2e9f0c60bd9e2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">alturl.com/ohr6</a>).

    "text": "Closer to 3.5 stars, but because I probably wouldn't go back to this place I will round down.  The service was excellent.. but we go for the steak not the service.  We went here based on the reviews on Yelp.  We got reservations for new years eve night.  It was pretty dead inside when we arrived.. we were quite surprised because it sounded busy when we called earlier.  The bread was above average.. just one kind, a loaf they give you. They brought a 2nd one when we finished.  The filet which we ordered I'd have to describe as a cross between ruth chris and flemings.  It was seasoned a little like flemings, and there was the hot butter like ruth chris.  It was on par with both of those chains, so you should know what I'm talking about.  Once you get to these quality of steaks, it's really the seasoning and flavoring that makes the difference, and the seasoning here was about a 2.5  The creme brulee was superb.. one of the best I've had.. I'd recommend it.  They don't have french fries, or a good selection of warm chocolate desserts like Morton's or Fleming's  We love chocolate so we were let down a little. .    They have a bowl of complimentary jelly beans, and the bathrooms here were excellent. There's a bathroom butler, and he walked in right when I was washing my hands offering a towel.. how did he know I was finished? A little creepy..  There was a tip jar in there with $100 bills showing. A little tempting for the partiers who walk in off the street who need to use the loo.  At about 1 minute to midnight on NYE, all the staff stopped whatever they were doing and ran to the top of the parking garage to watch the fireworks.   Prior to that, they had ESPN on until 10 minutes to midnite.. who wants to watch ESPN on NYE??  I don't even think they had any live games on.  Overall we just wanted to try this place, and were not wowed by the steak. I still like CUT as my favorite, with flemings being my 2nd favorite for a steakhouse of this caliber.  We would go back though if someone else wanted to go.. the steak was quite good.. but I couldn't stop thinking of the steak at CUT... we ended up going there the next night.",

Like a fine dining restaurant and a like a professional, our waiter greeted us right away, introduced himself and the menu. Benjamin, our waiter, had a fantastic attitude, very welcoming and made our experience personable. I guess on Sundays,  they offer a prix fix menu, which was the perfect portion. I had an 8 oz filet mignon, medium rare plus (cooked to perfection), with a Del salad, avocado dressing on the side, and their signature crab cake as my chosen side, all for $47? They allow different choice of steak with a small additional fee. Mentally, the 8 oz seemed like a tiny, small cut, but like I mentioned it was the perfection portion. We ordered additional sides that can feed the 4 of us with leftovers: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, mushrooms and asparagus.  The lover had a huge 22 oz bone - in ribeye, medium rare. He killed it, nothing left on that bone. The other couple ordered prix fix menu but upgrade to ribeye. Another great fact, is everyone's food served at the same time. Great customer service. This is by far my favorite steak restaurant. Better than Mastros, Ruth Chris, Houstons, 5A5(this one in SF), Flemings Beverly Hlls, and STK. Also, forgot to mention, complimentary cakes (freshly made lemon cake and cheesecake) celebrating Anniversaries.",

I knew we were in for way more than we were expecting as soon as I opened the menu.  Thank God the server quickly came over to help go over the selections.   Honestly though, it only left me even more indecisive since everything sounded soo good - only now I'm trying to stop myself from salivating as I make a decision.  Stone Crab legs, bone-in filet mignon, 20 oz lobster tail, huge side orders of potatoes au gratin and broccoli sauteed in garlic and white wine, and more,  our table was full of yummy goodness.  Steak was done perfectly and exactly as they described when I chose \"medium rare\".   The lobster tail was one of the best I've ever had, and I never had Stone Crab legs before, but those were delicious!  Service was also impeccable!  At one point, I had three people trying to serve me at once: one scooping potatoes onto my plate, another serving me broccoli, and another cutting up my lobster tail.  Not exactly cheap eats, but the price very well reflects the top quality of food and service you are presented with here.  If you're winning at the craps table, make it a point to dine here!    Winner, winner, Del Frisco's dinner!!",
