My husnand asked for a beer when she brought our food,never did that beer show up. I had to get up and go to the register to ask for a refill on my drink. They really need to work on their customer service. Tips are earned to just given. Sorry but i will not be back.  Food is good",

    "text": "Seafood lovers UNITE!!!  La Mojarra Loca is one of the top marisco spots in Vegas, my personal favorite for two reasons: consistency and pricing.  Customer Service: I'd actually give 5 stars of La Mojarra Loca had across the board customer service, I found service to be hit and miss, they get very busy here and I know its tough for waitors to be extra attentive under those circumstances.   FOOD: You dont have to break the bank to get good seafood here. I started going to this spot over 1 year ago, I've tried many items from the menu. I stick to the seafood tostada: fresh with lots of lime. The langostinos al rey: BEST thing on the menu in my opinion full of flavor lots of garlic and citrus. I've had molcajete, not as good as it looks, and the shrimp enchilada tacos were tasty as well.    DRINKS: If you like margaritas and micheladas, this place wont disappoint you! The mangoneada is so good here you forget there is tequila in it, but and the mangochelada is BEST here (can you tell I like mango?), perfect way to refresh yourself in the Vegas heat! What I like about the drinks here is that I dont feel short changed in quality or quantity.  Definitely recommend this place if you want Mexican seafood and drinks.",

Highly recommend El Canelo, where they treat you with great service & it's REAL AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD !",

I would recommend sticking to their sea food because I feel like that's their specialty, the MOJARRA LOCA is really good! I would start with that.  The service is good but it takes a while because this place is always packed unless you come on a weekday morning which we have lol. But from thurs- Sunday night it's usually a 30-45 min wait and that's just to be seated after that it takes the waiter about 10-15 mins to come and take your drink order (I would recommend hitting the bar while waiting, but you usually have t wait there too. Lol) then another 10 for your food order and another 20 for your food to arrive, so I hope y'all are patient. Anyway if you go with a good group of friends and got time to kill this is the spot.",

Tortilla is homemade so I think that was more the issue.   I had three tacos - shrimp and carne asada. Tacos were huge! Was thinking they were street tacos but they were full ones. Carne asada taco only had meat and nothing else - though it was good. Shrimp taco was gross. There's a weird breading they put on. I'm not familiar with it but it was gross. Couldn't eat it. Which is too bad.   So food overall was 3.   Problem was that it took quite awhile for food to come and there weren't even that many people at the time. Server showed up rarely.   Busboys were very attentive tho. Drinks always filled. Chips kept coming!",

    "text": "If I could give it zero stars I would. 11 of us decided to go here for my mother's birthday last minute. We called ahead 30 minutes before we even got there telling them our party size, the girl said it would be a 25 minute wait. We get there and we had to wait even more so we were told. 45 minutes later, still waiting. We were told our table was being cleaned, that it'd be 10 minutes. 23 minutes later and we FINALLY got a table. I didn't mind the wait because it was a Saturday night and it was a big group, however I didn't like that they kept telling us 10 minutes we had to wait another 20. If it's going to be 45 minutes just let us know instead of saying that's something is almost ready. They sat us down and no menus for anyone. We had to search for someone to bring us some after 5 minutes at the table. Finally they brought some drinks we ordered and an appetizer after what some time. We finally got someone to take our entree order... Well it seems like it was yesterday because our food took FOREVER to come. Finally it came.. Or so I think? 3 plates came. Every 5 minutes another one would come. We like to eat together so we wait until everyone has their food. Well we couldn't wait anymore and so everyone started to eat. Some were already finished with their dish and one plate of green cheese enchiladas were still missing! Finally we complained about it and when they came the cheese wasn't even melted. It was the easiest dish of all and it came soooo late and had a can taste to the green salsa (the same person had ordered it before and loved it!). My shrimp tacos were okay but not worth how late they came. My cousins dish was so bland and flavorless. In a party of 11, 4 of us didn't like our dish. Also, I know that gratuity is added to a large party but it wasn't even deserved. Overall it wasn't worth the wait and the food wasn't even that good this time. But it was enough to not make me want to come again.",

Of course the food was amazing! Not a single complaint from any one of us. We've gone to eat there a few times and each time your staff is on point and the food is perfect. Would be happy to recommend for any occasion. Thank you for making our wedding great!",

I decided to bring my family here for mothers day and I knew it would be full and we were very patient to be seated and attended. We waited 45 minutes to be seated and the waiter came fairly quick. We waited almost an hour for our food to be served  and when our food arrived it was cold and soggy. I ordered the caldo de camaron and it was very salty, the shrimp were fine, but this ruined my meal and I didn't want to reorder because that would take too long. I would expect a restaurant like this to have prepared a bit more.",

    "text": "Yelp alerted me that there was a hot Mexican restaurant  nearby us, we were at Sunrise Hospital.  Totally read mom's mind lol Mexican food is her fav & we were impressed by the reviews & pictures.  What a perfectly festive Mexican atmosphere!  The bright coral colored building was so easy to find.  A large dining area toward the left & an opened seating area & bar to the right.  I love the decor w/ a couple of horse & mariachi statues & authentic Mexican blankets hanging from the wall.  We sat at the huge bar, in front of window by the 'Ceviche Station.'     Bartender Danny, Chef Jose & the whole crew were awesome.  I ordered a large Margarita on ice w/ salt as the chips & dip arrived.  I told them that I felt like something healthy & spicy w/ Pulpo (octopus).  Chef Jose had me try three sauces, all of which were tasty.  One had a Hawaiian bbq flare, one had a nice spice, but the lime & Tajin sauce was ultimately my fav.  He made this fresh & amazing dish called the Botanas Mixta Fria, except w/ octopus only.  He also made a small side dish of the Botanas Tropical.  Perfect name for it too w/ the shrimp ceviche, mango & the Hawaiian spicy sauce.  The ceviche comes w/ two tostadas wow!  Ceviche is a cold seafood dish just in case you're looking for something hot, like mom was.    Mom had the Enchilada Verdes de Pollo w/ white rice, beans & three very filling shredded chicken enchiladas, covered in a tasty green tomatillo sauce.  I ate half of an enchilada w/ hot sauce & it had enough sour cream so I didn't need to ask for a side of it.  Perfect amount of everything in this enchilada.  I am not a fan of shredded chicken, but this was the best.    The other bar guests order some yummy items too such as the Tamarindo Water, Mango Margarita & an oyster topped w/ shrimp ceviche.  Both the cocktail list & food menu were spectacular.  More than burritos, tacos, enchiladas & margaritas, there are so many unique seafood dishes w/ half-shelled oysters, mussels, crab & lobster, a beautiful pineapple & shrimp dish called a Pina Loca, along w/ oyster shooters & Michalada's.  The Molcajetes are calling our name in the very near future lol steak, shrimp, chicken, chorizo or the Volcan w/ shrimp, crab, octopus & prawns!  The presentation is one-of-a-kind & huge!  One to four people sized dish w/ all of this wonderfulness in a large mortar.    I really hate to say it, but both the pulpo & enchiladas were better than my top two favorite Mexican spots, one located on the strip, Javier's at the Aria & our local fav Lindo's!  Certain things like the chips w/ salsa & beans w/ Strip View are better at Lindo's, but that's nothing compared to the menu at La Mojarra Loca... whoa!  I can't wait to come back for so much more.  I am not a fan of the location, far from my house, but for lunch I will be back.  Also it's got that authentic feel & on the weekends they have the live mariachi.  Salud!",

    "text": "My fave when it comes to Mexican food here in Vegas!  Was here for Valentine's on a Sunday, so of course it was super packed. Started off all bad, we waited for an hour after finding out we were skipped on the list. The organization with the waitlist was all bad, my group wasn't the only one that had this problem.  Once we were finally seated, the servers made up for everything. They were very nice and attentive to our every need, even though they were super busy running around. All our food was delicious, nothing was rushed or sloppy. To compensate the errors with the seating, we got a dessert and alcoholic drink for free.   Overall my group and I ended up very happy, and will definitely be back. This location beats the other 2 locations here in Vegas. The molcajete, flan, and mangoniada with alcohol are a must try!! I forgot to take pictures.",

The lines that came with them were also a nice touch. Between the three of us we ordered 6 tacos to share and a side of their homemade tortillas and our tab came to the reasonable amount of $26.",

After 30 minutes of waiting for them to fix their mistake....my husband canceled his order and we called the manager and he just told us \"Well, what can I say ...Sorry! \" that's it !! What a horrible experience....my poor husband left the place extremely upset and hungry!!! Avoid this place !!!!",

    "text": "It's always tricky when planning a party of 8, particularly when it's your own birthday. I called La Mojarra Loca that same day and they were great about accommodating my request. When we arrived we were quickly seated. This was all of our first time dining here. Right as you walk in you feel the lively energy and aromas of what will hopefully be some amazing food. Once we were seated we were promptly greeted by Sergio and Esteban who took care of our drink orders and the chips for the table. The live music and energetic environment makes it a bit difficult to communicate with the servers but it's not anything you can't overcome.  At this point Sergio was swapped with Omar and we had the addition of Lucero helping Esteban out with our table. All of them were very diligent and attentive.  So let's get to the food!!! We ordered a dozen ostiones preparados and empanadas de camaron for the table. Some of the other items where the Volcan (which is portioned enough to share between at least two), fish ceviche, camarones al mojo de ajo and seafood cocktail. With the exception of one of the individuals being unhappy with his ceviche order, the food was amazing!  Everything tasted fresh and well seasoned. Unfortunately there are no photos because there was not enough time between when the food hit the table to when everyone dove in.  Saying that I would come back here again is an understatement as I'm writing this as I wait for our table to be ready one week after our first visit. Ha ha/Ja ja",

I'm not a great fan of spicy things and I ordered this dish which they adjusted the spicyness for my taste buds.   1- the margarita was delish! 2- everything was good.   I should have more details but bottom line....JUST GO THERE and try something you have never had before.  You will enjoy the experience.",

You can't go wrong with their classic margarita but if your looking for something a little different you have to try their Wildberry Margarita- YUM O!  My first time to this restaurant was about 2 weeks ago, the hostess that seated was so sweet, she acknowledged us when we left thanking us for coming and to have a good evening. Our waiter was prompt, knowledgeable and courteous.  Sad to say but Tonight's service (7/31/17)was a little lacking in all those categories. The hostess completely ignored us as we walked out the door.  They seated us next to the restrooms and the multiple employees tripped on the leg of one of our chairs... really....",

Seriously, so delicious. We will definitely go back again just for the volcan. We also ordered the oysters with ceviche. We ordered a dozen and all the food was enough for two people. I ordered a mango lemonade and it was a very fun summertime drink. Idk if it's a permanent item or just a special for this weekend. But either way, if it's available, I definitely recommend getting it. Our server was a fellow named Yuri. Although it was very busy (we went during the dinner rush) he was very quick to get our orders, did not take long to bring us our food, and was still very attentive to us. I loved everything.

He only reason I don't give them five stars is because the girls in the front couldn't keep up with who was coming in, who was seated, and who cancelled their table. They kept calling the same names of people who had already left even after being told instead of giving the table to another party that was there they kept waiting on the other people.

While it was crowded, it wasn't too bad and we were able to get a seat at the bar and eat rather quickly. If we wanted a table we would have had to wait an hour or so. Not a deal breaker on a busy holiday like this.  We had the fajitas with chicken, shrimp and steak. It was a nice mix and they were generous with the shrimp. I believe we had 7 in the mix. A great ratio! The salsa is pretty hot so be careful.  Plentiful free parking. Overall a fun spot off The Strip.",

That's why I blame myself for choosing this restaurant on a Friday night that happened to be Cinco De Mayo that also happened to be during the dinner rush. I'd like to be a dick and low ball them but that's not what yelp or I are about.  Totally five stars for the food, but not a 5 star experience.  First off shout out to the server and kitchen for getting the kids food out super fast upon request.  Anyways this place is super cute and the atmosphere was fun. They had a mariachi and it was packed. They quoted us twenty minutes but that wasn't a thing.  We had a feast! First time for me and we ordered everything and it was all delicious.  I definitely recommend the Fried fish with seafood and the volcan molcajete. The sauce on this dish is amazing. It's $30 but comes with tortillas, rice, beans, and assorted fish in a spicy sauce. The sauce is SO GOOD! OMG! I'm wishing I kept the left overs. It's rich, sweet, spicy, and so complex. The mojarra loca is the restrautants name sake and is served with rice and beans and topped with shrimp and octopus. This is $18 and the fish is a pretty decent size.   The shrimp that come in both dishes are amazing.   Also get the oysters toped with ceviche WOW! $18 amazing combination, oysters have a lot of meat, and the ceviche is so fresh. Amazing amazing amazing.  Aside from that we got a kids order of chicken fingers with fries, shrimp empanadas, cheese and bacon mussels, and a small shrimp cocktail. We also all got cocktails. Everything was good except the mussels were weird.  So a thousand percent the food was on point. Came out quick, awesome flavor, cooked well, and stuff I've never seen before. For being all seafood I think the price was worth it too as most dishes are shareable.  My downside was the staffs inability to handle how busy it was. I would totally give them five stars but they can definitely improve. We didn't get our bill until like 20 minutes after our meal and asking twice. On top of waiting an hour and a half to be seated it was just irritating. Our drinks and food came out quickly when we finally ordered but they were just understaffed. They said their systems were down and apologized and we had to scrounge up cash to cover the bill since they couldn't take cards which was fine but the whole \"two tables are ahead of you\" while five more parties got called before us was just irritating and not forgivable. Also no refill on our drinks until we got the check.  I will definitely go back here and have a meal during non peak hours because the food was great.",

I thought all would be well since we made reservations in advance, and I noticed that the restaurant was empty when we arrived (there was maybe another small group or 2). We were seated and the first round of drinks came out pretty fast. Everything after that went down hill. It took forever for them to get the requested drinks out and even longer for us to get our order. We ended up eating an hour and a half after our arrival. Once we began to eat our dinner, we were told that we had a few minutes to add anything since the kitchen was closing. I tried to be understanding since we did have a big party, but they should have been prepared since reservations were made. Not impressed. At all.",

Service here is below average. That one star should be for the cooks since that's the only reason I ever decided to go back. I hate to be this critical but the waiter really really sucked.   I'll give a quick run down.   We arrived. Place wasn't packed or full, seated pretty quickly. We definitely didn't even get acknowledged for roughly around 10min since we sat. The thing that really bothered me was that the soon to be waiter and helper, spent does 10 min not helping anyone around us. Lorenzo was what the receipt stated his name to be. He approached us and handed us menus. Lol. Didn't apologize, didn't even offer a water. Wow. Ok. Chips and salsa slowly followed after. Lorenzo blond hair waiter didn't take our order post 20 min and just told us if we had figured out what we wanted to drink. I should have stood up and left but my wife encouraged me to stay. Ordered drinks. And this is where I broke.   We finished our drinks and only after we finished our drinks did Lorenzo decide to take our order and then ask me if I wanted a refill. Ha. Good one man. I kept it cool. Ate my food. He brought the wrong tortillas. Figured that would happen also. Left him a dollar tip for him to remember me.   It seemed as if everything was done on purpose. Shady stuff. The food was bomb tho. But that won't bring me back. I will never step foot into this place again.   I ain't with no drama. I just hope you think twice before eating here. It's really a hit or miss depending on who is your waiter but if you run a successful business, or in this case, food business, you can't have Lorenzo blond waiter as your first line. It just can't happen. Disrespectful attitude.",

I open it, stick my finger in and taste it holy baby Jesus... idk if it's cheese... but it's first hot.. and delicious. I put it in all 3 of my shrimpy cheesy(I might add these guys were stuffed with shrimp...!) each bite left me mouth watering... I was building up a sweat.. my nose was running.

We were accommodated & got sat on a table within 10 minutes even though they were busy.  It was going great , the busser asked us what we would like to drink and the server was quick to get our order. It went all bad when the server's family came in to eat and all of a sudden, we didn't have anymore server. Our water cups were empty for quite a while, we waited 10 minutes for our check, they forgot our lime and we had to ask for it 3 times and we weren't even checked by our server how we liked our food. When it was time to get the check, the server had no sort of smile and she only said thank you once we had swiped my card. As good as the food is, can't come back here because of the horrible service we have received today",

So I got charged the up sale when I clearly didn't. Staff was pretty condescending when the matter was brought up.   The restaurant also has a a strong odor as if there was a tire fire by the kitchen. That caused a bit of nausea.",

This place can be hit and miss though.  I've noticed that when they are busy the food sometimes is lacking. Luke warm shrimp is not the most pleasant thing to eat. Also, I will not be returning to this restaurant on Sundays. The band is wayyyyyy to loud. It's cool for the first song or so, but after a half an hour of trumpets blaring in your ears you start to get annoyed. You can't even hold a conversation with the person next to you. Stupid reason to loose business IMHO.   Update   Another star gone for these guys from me. Service is absolutely awful. Twice now in a row the staff has been rude and always rushed. I don't know what the management is thinking by having such a small waitstaff. They are always miserable and seem to be overwhelmed and off kilt. Food is still amazing, and this is the only reason this place is not one star. Going to eat at the bar next time, and see if it's any better. If that doesn't go well, I think I'm done with this place.",

They forgot one of our shrimp ceviches and when I called the girl acknowledged that they forgot it and asked if we wanted to come get it. I said no because we live 30 min away. She talked to the manager to see what they could do. After she gets back on the phone she claims both shrimp ceviches were put in the same container! Fricking shady ass people.   Also, the food is below average. I had a bite of everything we ordered and the shrimp a la Diablo, and Mexican rice are blah. The ceviche is average, and the combination seafood tostada is gross. It has a weird sweet flavor. I'm so mad I came here based on the Yelp reviews. This place is a 2 star at best. Definitely not 4 Star and the food is way overpriced. There are a lot of better and cheaper Mexican seafood restaurants in Vegas. The one on Charleston near downtown is the best one we've had so far.",

The hostess gave us our menus and said \"your server will be right with you\"   The server Zaira arrived and was obviously only concerned about her large party (more money) she said \"hello what can I get you?\" We all ordered then the Busser brought us our drinks. The food runner and Busser brought us our food and forgot our tortillas they said they would bring them right away. We had to ask for the tortillas 10 min later and the server brought us 2 tortillas each and didn't speak to us she seemed annoyed.   My mother then complained that her chicken smelled like fish and the server laughed she said \"senora we don't even make that dish with fish it's only chicken or carne asada\" (she looked back at her large table and smiles) \"do you want something else then?!\" My mother said yes can I have the dish without meat? She snatches the plate and walks away. She brings a new dish after about 15 min. Doesn't speak just drops the plate and leaves. We ask her for napkins and she slams a napkin dispenser on our table. We asked for a box to go and left.   Dine here if you want to be treated like garbage!",

    "text": "My partner and i  (Who is Latin, and knows everyone, everywhere) used to go here to eat, as there was a great waitress (Bree), and the food was always good.  One Saturday morning we woke up and decided to go out bar hopping, after a brunch at La Mojarra Loca, and we would Uber it all day.  We got an Uber directly from home to La Mojarra Loca.  After we were seated, we got  a different waitress, who wasn't all that friendly.  We asked for 2 Patron Margaritas, and a dozen oysters to start.  While waiting for our drinks, a manager from another Mexican restaurant stopped to talk to us, and told us that this restaurant had the best Micholadas.  So I asked the waitress If i could have a Michelada also.  She told me 'NO!\"  Excuse me?  She said \"you don't need 2 drinks!\"  So, after about 10 minutes we received 2 glasses of crushed ice with about a shot of Patron in it with a shot of sweet and sour.  Just awful.  So, My partner complained to the manager, they spoke in Spanish for about 3 minutes, and eventually the manager brought what was supposed to be a margarita. It was AWFUL, so I asked the manager \"Is this Patron?\"  He Said \"NO, THAT'S EXTRA!'  I replied \"Well, that's what i ordered when i sat down.\"  He dismissed me and went away.   We were given a plate of oysters, which were quite good, as expected.  Then the waitress never came back.  So after about 15 minutes. I told my partner \"lets go to another restaurant!\"  Waitress never came back to ask if we wanted anything to eat.  So, we went to counter, to the manager, and asked for my check.  $75.  We had fully intended to pay for the oysters that we consumed, but expected some kind of break since we weren't actually served any real cocktails.  So I said to the manager \"Youre really going to charge me for those so called drinks?\"  He replied \"Well, Next time I'll......\"  I said \"Oh, no, there won't be a next time!' The waitress was so lousy she didn't deserve a nickel tip, but i cant do that to anyone, she still got a $5, which was way more than she deserved.   Used to love the place, food was good. Drinks are Awful, and don't like the management.  When my customers ask where is a good Mexican restaurant (and I was even asked on the street one time, and referred them) I refer them to La Mojarra Loca, but advise them to save their money on the drinks.  Get a beer. Will never be back.",

We got some alcoholic beverages and they were OKAY not great i got a puerto vallarta drink which is kind of like a pina colada but hardly any taste of any alcohol and it had whole pieces of ice wasn't to great to try and drink it (guessing they need a better blender?) .Reason I gave a low rating was the poor customer service. Yes at first when we arrived all smiles but then waited roughly 15-20 minutes to actually get an order in. Once we were done eating we waited at least 20 minutes we kept looking around our waiter was no where to be seen so finally i caught another waiters attention and asked if he could call our waiter so we can get the check . Our waiter finally showed up and gave us our ticket said thank you and walked away as we were placing our cards to pay we realized he charged us for some drinks we had ordered but we were told \"oh sorry we dont have any more \" so we switched to regular drinks but he still wanted to charge us the other drinks we asked him to correct it and the ticket came back TWENTY dollars more then before . Does that make any sense?? We went to talk to the manager and he said \"oh yes he forgot to add the gratuity \" WHAT??? So our waiter disappears we don't get any more drinks nothing and still we have to tip him more then 20 dollars? Well first time going to la mojarra loca and most definitely will be the LAST ! Thanks Brian you made it memorable!",

No transparency here, I ordered cheese enchiladas and asked LULU our server if it would be extra for MOLE. She said no its cheese so it didn't matter what sauce you got. Get the check and it went from 10.99 to 13.99 with an enforced gratuity of 3.64 per person. Total was well over 17.00 for crummy cheese enchiladas. I asked LULU why it wasn't the original 10.99 wo which she responded \"I never talked to you about anything.\" ***DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!

We found out about the place from one of our Lyft drivers! Highly recommend the Molcajete Trio and Caldo de Pescado and the horchata (this will come in handy if you're a weakling like me when it comes to spice levels). 9.5/10 would buy again A+ :)",

We were lucky enough to get seated as soon as we walked in, because as we were coming out after our meal...the line could have gone on and on till the parking lot (LOL)  Let's talk food!!!! Ordered a corona for my drink and my boyfriend had the preparada. They bring you chips and salsa, so appetizer was optional. I ordered my favorite mojarra a la frita, which consisted of a huge fried fish, with rice and beans, a side salad and your choice of either corn or flour tortilla. I'm gonna be completely honest....the side dishes, I BARELY had any on my plate. But my fish was HUGE. I wish they gave more rice and beans, because rice &I beans ARE EVERYTHING!!! And why be selfish with that? They pretty much top the whole meal! My boyfriend ordered the camarones a la dibla. At first he said they tasted like ketchup, but then he got used to the taste. It was for sure a lot different that most Mexican places we've gone to. And his portions were also small. He ended up eating some of my meal because his weren't filling at all. And his meal didn't come with beans. Wimp womp!   Overall, the place was clean and pretty good. Service was also on point, Bryan was our server and he didn't disappoint us. He was attentive and was always around when we needed something. But portion wise, I wish they weren't so selfish with it. After all, you're not paying 5 dollars for your meal, more like $18.99 per dish!",

I went back to the restaurant to complaint I did not cancel the c.c. transaction (because the buss boy, cooks, dishwasher would be affected too) but got the cash back and told them that it was just unacceptable. I know I should have reviewed my bill first (I usually do, lesson learned) How many people just pay and never check? I bet a few.   I understand for big groups the tip is included in the bill but not for a family of 3 adults in a restaurant, So if you are thinking of eating at this place, make sure you check everything before pay.",

I also had their sangria which was pretty good. It was fruity and tasty but didn't seem to have too much wine. They had a lot of different margaritas that I'd like to try next time. Almost everything on the menu has pictures too, so that's always a plus when you're trying to decide on what to order!

This time I made a reservation for 10 people. It was the first time trying this place for a lot of them. I always recommend  this restaurant to everybody I know, their Molcajete Trio is my personal favorite. As soon as everybody in our party arrived we were seated right away. I was surprised how fast and we got an awesome table.  There was a problem with one of the waiters, he was very rude to me and he wouldn't take my order until it was my turn. My students were still indecisive on what to get, I was ready to order but he told me that he's taking my friend's order first. He did this 3 times to me, and once to my wife! The only reason why I'm leaving a 5 star review is because of the manager Francisco. He absolutely saved the night. He was very professional. I told him what happened and he immediately took care of it. And plus, the food is really good, and the staff is very nice. I won't mention the waiter's name, G, but if this happens again I will for sure. We are going tonight, August 17, with a group of 8. I'll definitely update this review afterwards. Thanks for your time.",

This place was in the same parking lot as Escapology so we took the easy way out. And wow did we luck out.   I had some slight knocks on the place that keeps it from five star. But I won't even go into those. They were nitpicking at best.   Note that it is a seafood heavy Mexican restaurant. You can get a standard chicken burrito or steak fajita but you kinda have to dig for it. Everything else was shrimp, fish, swordfish, octopus (seriously). Maybe that's typical out here and Denver Mexican standards just different.  I figured despite the fact we were so far from water I'd go with the Tacos Enchilados de Camarones.  They were amazing. I figure I'd get three basic street tacos, light on ingredients. But no. They were stuffed.  The cabbage and pickled onions were fresh and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  And there was something different about their taco shells.  I can't explain it, but they were fantastic.   If you want off the strip and want to avoid overpriced tourist traps, this is your place. Well done! Service was prompt.",

I also had the caldo de camarones and it was good, it had good flavor but I would just suggest that they add some veggies to it... maybe some carrots and green beans??? It was still good though.

We probably could have stopped eating  after our appetizers...but food was too tasty.  We were almost at 'perfect' until a guy with an apron and HUGE 'garbage/mop bucket combo' cart slushed by us while carrying another mop bucket in one hand.  No matter what, garbage bins, buckets and carts should not be pushed thru a dining area inches from my food and table-period. So....not sure with all our Vegas choices if I go back or not.  I will have to rid my memory of the garbage/ mop slop. Sorry LML Grill that costs one STAR.",

    "text": "Hey, do you want to eat a ton of meat and shrimp out of a heavy stone bowl? OF COURSE YOU DO.  Let's cut to the chase. Get the Molcajete Trio. You are getting the shrimp / chicken / and steak, almost shooting out of a huge bowl.  A two person meal of those cost $28. It will feed both of you.   Opt for the corn tortillas. I've been burned by horrible corn tortillas by other restaurants so I asked for both. Corn are just superior to the flour ones. Plus, the corn tortillas actually hold up here. Side Note: Can we just outlaw store-bought corn tortillas? Or rename them something else. Store bought corn tortillas have just ruined the corn tortillas great name.   As leftovers, these kept for plenty of days. The steak was still juicy and that marinade was finger licking good. The chicken was moist too and that marinade...  Just when you ask for leftovers, don't think about the environment. The server almost had a stroke because I opted to put the tortillas in with the rest of the food instead of getting a separate box for them. YES YES, I know the tortillas are delicious and hand made. Didn't want the unnecessary waste.   I've learned my lesson. Get a box for your tortillas. Get a box for your stone bowls of meat. Enjoy for days. Repeat.",

    "text": "DISABILITY RELATED. We have a 7 year old son that is nonverbal and has autism. He is so sweet, not loud or disruptive. We have taken him to the nicest restaurants in the entire country since he was a baby. When he was diagnosed with autism when he was 3, it explained a lot about why he had a hard time with food textures. There are very few foods he will eat, and we are happy that we figured out what he will eat. Last night we went to La Mojarra and we brought our sons' Raising Canes chicken fingers like we usually do. As soon as we walked in, I'm assuming the assistant manager said right away that no outside food is allowed, and was so rude about it. I tried to explain the situation and he said he would let it pass one time and that it is a LAS VEGAS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT regulation. We then asked to speak to the general manager, Jamie Ayala. Mr Ayala immediately said the same thing, quickly likened our sons disability to his wife's allergies. Not the same thing. He again mentioned it is against LAS VEGAS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT rules and regulations. I tried to explain that my son is defined as disabled under federal law and this is why he has food sensitivities. He said we can eat but this is the last time he will allow us to bring in our sons specific meal again. I told him we will never eat there again.   We still wanted Mexican food so we went to Lindo Michoacan on east Desert Inn. I talked to the manager named Hugo and he was so much nicer, the staff was nicer. He explained to me that they teach their staff to welcome people with disabilities and we can bring our sons food in as long as they don't handle it. What a relief!!   I called the LAS VEGAS HEALTH DEPARTMENT today and I explained the situation and they said clearly that there are no rules or regulations against bringing our own food, especially for our son that is disabled. Restaurants can make their own rules about whatever they want but they cannot supersede Federal law and always be ADA compliant. We will be speaking with our attorney on how to take this matter further. The numbers of children with autism are not declining, they are climbing and we need to raise awareness.",

There were hostesses around walking aimlessly not greeting anyone or offering any sort of explanation for the wait. This place easily seats 100 persons. Most tables were empty. However we waited 40 minutes to be seated.  When I asked the hostess why we waited so long if there was so many tables.  She stated there were only two servers.  Basically two servers for the entire restaurant in the middle of lunch.  Right before we were seated a party of 12 came in, about 5 minutes after we were seated they were seated. We were basically left at the table. No one ever came to greet us, take our order or simply out of courtesy say someone would be with us shortly.   We sat there, ate chips and still no one came. We decided to walk out and leave. No one even bothered to say anything, other then the hostess that just said \"thank you\" on our way out.  This place has very poor customer service, it's too bad I can't write a review of the food. Never made it that far.",

The menu is huge (12 pages) and has more variety than any other Mexican restaurant that I have been too with the majority of their options being seafood, which again, is another first for me for Mexican restaurants.  There are some descriptions but we had to ask about a few items where the descriptions were lacking.    We started with free chips and salsa which were great and definitely had some heat to it.  I also got two margaritas over the course of the night with them both tasting good but also different from each other.  I ordered the steak norte which is cut up steak topped with a green salsa, mushrooms, and cheese with beans and rice on the sides.  The beans aren't really anything to write home about and in fact, mine were room temperature when I got them but they promptly gave me a new serving of piping hot beans.  My girlfriend got a molcajete filled with steak, chicken, shrimp, cheese, cactus, and a spicy sauce.  It was huge and it was delicious.  I have never seen a dish like it before.  We both left super full and super satisfied.  You have to come here and see what's going on.  I wish it was closer but it's distance from me will not stop me from returning here.",

Parking: huge shopping center parking lot. Parking was no issue  Service: I do not mean to be biased but any Mexican restaurant I have ever gone to has been great service. The service here was just as good as it food! The people were friendly and offered their opinions on what we should order!   Pricing: insanely fair prices (see receipt)  Trend level: very authentic Mexican setting and vibes!   Overall: amazing and I will let anybody I know going to Las Vegas about this restaurant and how amazing the food is!! Do not get sucked in by the glamorous strip this is where the real food it is",

I wish I had a bigger stomach to try all of these yummy looking items. There was a huge bar in the back of the restaurant.  Service was OK it could've been better. The drinks were really good but it took a while to get to us.  We had a Mitchelada  and Mangonada  We ordered the Shrimp Taco Enchilados.... Sooo good!  their homemade tortillas stuffed with shrimp, cheese and red sauce (mane enchilada sauce?) idk but it was so good full of flavor.  \"The VOLCAN\" Seafood in a hot stone bowl  (Shrimp.

And Carlos was also really nice. Lol. Anyways, the micheladas didn't disappoint. The margaritas were soooo good. And the ceviche was delicious. So all in all it was a great experience. Good food. Great service. Friendly people. My only complain is that we didn't get Carlos number. Haha. Joking. I totally 100% recommend this place to outsiders.",

    "text": "Terrible experience! Im sure the food is good, but we didn't get to taste a dish. My brother and I walked into an almost empty restaurant one morning and were seated at a booth. I quickly recognized the sun was going to be a problem, so i requested a booth with no sun. I saw a booth, but a waiter (a 20-something, light complected, gym rat, and un intellectual) quickly declined our request because the table We sat at was for a party of six or more. I explained we wanted a booth, with no sun, but the waiter insisted we dont qualify to sit at mentioned table. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!   After a couple of rounds of going back and fourth on where they would let us sit...we simply left. We couldn't believe their inflexibility and lack of customer service. NEVER EAT THERE!",

    "text": "On Sunday July 14, 2019 me and my family of 6 dined at this location for dinner. We walked in without a reservation but were seated within 10 minutes. Once seated our server, Ivan, promptly greeted us. He gave us a brief \"menu tour\", he asked if we liked spicy or mild foods, he made a few suggestions, and took our orders. One by one the plates came to our table and each one better than last but all very delicious. Our kids had a wet chicken burrito, shrimp ceviche, and some of our Volcan molcajete. We had the langostinos a la mojarra style, langostinos rey, and camarones zarandeados. We had fresh limon-ade and a cadillac margarita YUM! The house salsa, chips, rice and beans were great too. Ivan was knowledgeable about the menu, listened to our preferences, and we were so happy with his recommendations. We were one of his last tables for the evening but he still offered great conversation and exceptional service. Great first time experience here!!!!",

I like this place so far , and I like how they have numerous locations we would usually go to the one on Maryland,  but its always packed so we started going to one by my house and you get attended quick.  Another thing that sucks about this place is you DO NOT GET REFILS which is dumb ! My boyfriend didnt like the caldo 7 mares, but over all the rest of the food we got was really good :)",

    "text": "Food: 5 stars Service: 1 star Value: 4 stars  So I want to start off by emphasizing that the food here was AMAZING. Probably one of the absolute best Shrimp Cocktails I've ever had. This place would have been a SOLID 5 stars, had it not been for the seemingly snobby, inattentive staff. First of all, is it just me, or do all the guys here look like they work at chippendales at night? (not a bad thing, obviously). Everyone here was really good looking, not sure if that contributed to the inattentiveness, but it was definitely different.   The place was fairly empty on Thursday afternoon when we visited. Our group of 6 was seated immediately, and we received our drinks in a timely manner. They also brought us two sets of chips and salsa to start. To drink, I had a \"casuela\" which was like a margarita in a bowl. It was pretty good, and not to mention, HUGE!   I ordered the Shrimp Cocktail (as I mentioned before) and it was so good I ate it without adding ketchup or lemon which I don't think I've ever done before. It was absolutely delicious! My kids had a plain cheeseburger, and most of us had a shrimp cocktail.   Where this place went wrong was the follow-up. My uncles practically had to beg for a refill on their beers. The food took quite a long while to arrive despite the restaurant not being that full. The girl seemed annoyed that we were asking for things, and no one there was very hospitable.   Despite the sketchy service, the food made up for it all! I also heard they have mariachi on weekends, so that would be worth another visit.   Overall, I would probably return and hope for a better visit!",

The menu is big, tons of options including some for kids. If you can handle spicy, the \"aguachile verde\" is definitely one of the best I've ever had, but also and by far the spiciest. Everything else was really good, we had shrimp empanadas and shrimp soup. As usual for Mexican places they have agua de Jamaica, agua de tamarindo and horchata, but the real winner is the lemonade, made with limes and not lemons, it's as authentic as it gets. If the great food and amazing service is not enough reason to go, the mariachi band is super talented, and as opposed to other places the music volume is not so loud that you can barely hear what the other people on your table are saying.",

Not only is the food delish but the service is outstanding! Another added bonus is the honesty that this restaurant provides. I literally lost my cell phone and didn't notice until i left the restaurant. Tracing my footsteps back, i called them an hour later and gosh darn it they had my iphone . That meant the world to me, you have no idea! I couldn't have been more touched by their work ethic. Anyone who's lost a phone knows that awful feeling but to get it back and on my 5 hour road trip home was a relief! Thanks staff and management for the honest work ethic! Much to you all!",

I'm not much of a seafood type though so I tried their chicken enchiladas with green sauce - it was very good. Their rice and beans are par for Mexican restaurant fare. The chips and salsa are good but they don't warm up the chips at all and they needed a little extra salt.  If your looking for good mexican seafood though I would say its worth a shot. The meals I saw others getting, especially the shrimp dishes, looked amazing. It ended up being a bit pricey at around $30 after a house margarita (that even though made from mix was good) for just myself but I'll be back eventually I imgagin if I'm in the area for dinner again.",

Portions were enormous and could easily be shared between two people or half taken home for lunch the next day!   English is a second language here so be prepared for a small language barrier. If you speak Spanish you'll have the advantage (I don't, but got along just fine)!   Lastly the military discount is quite generous!",

We ordered micheladas, coctel de camaron, shrimp ceviche and camarones a la diabla and a few oysters all of which I loved! Just for fun we did the oyster shots as well and they were so good!! Staff was attentive and friendly and the building itself was very nice. Very colorful and clean. I will be back again :)",

I'll tell you why the salsa should have a little, because it's free!!! Also, it would at least be memorable, this was tomato tasting water.  I had a tasty dish called the \"loco tacos\" which were pretty good but not spicy. I wonder why they call them loco? What's loco about them? The tacos were huge wand good but the rice and beans was on another plate which made it even harder to eat my meal. Remember the bar is not convenient for dining since they don't have to wooden bar attachments that most restaurants have. Anywhoot service was adequate, place is clean and typical.

Nuestros meseros.)  I love when the customer service is just as good as their food. SERGIO and JAIME we're AMAZING waiters! I can't express enough the excellence they showed in service.  You know if the food is good but the service is bad the experience is automatically unpleasant. This however was a VERY PLEASANT experience.   They checked up on you to make sure you were good on everything. Always had refills and they are also good with kids. So you can bet you won't be forgotten.   I had a bad experience at the location on Lake Mead a few times and this Valentine's day morning before the crowd.

Now that I come back and bring them more customers , it was the worst experience & I feel embarrassed to have even brought my people here. They ordered shrimps they did not like , & asked if they could change them for something else on the menu. The response was no . That it's not their fault we did not like the shrimp. & everyone else's food was cold we had to send that back . It was just a hassle the manger ni sus narisses para disculparse. ( the manager never even showed up to at least apologize ) great you're welcome for a free 100$ check that we had to pay at the end with HORRIBLE FOOD & SERVICE !! Will never be back . Learn some customer service people. As I am in the industry & this would never happen anywhere else. Also El Canelo search that up has better service & amazing food!",

We ordered drinks and it took another 15 minutes to get them. We order dinner when she brought back the drinks and it took forever to get our food. We spend over an hour and a half from start to finish and at a Mexican restaurant, that is unacceptable.  Two of us ordered the chicken burrito and it should have been called a rice burrito. It was huge but full of filler ingredients instead of chicken.  The waitress did apologize for the wait but it is to little to late.  Too many other choices for Mexican food.",

Service is great, every server we've had is friendly just lacking on attention (biggest issue for me is refills) What really grinds my gear is on every visit the order never comes out right in at least one dish. Now i don't know if this is the cooks fault or servers fault but I'd say cooks due to the servers always repeating the order back. Now it wouldn't be a huge deal if food was out quick but even at that food takes a while to come out. By the time my dish is out the rest of the party is close to finishing their plate. In regards to food taste it's exceptional, better spots out there but the amount of food to the price is what makes up for it. Really wouldn't recommend unless last resort",

They were walking around but never came to our side of the restaurant.  Food was ok nothing special. A lot of items were missing through out our dinner and had to keep asking for things.

    "text": "My visit was Saturday 8/25. We got there late night around 8pm. We were told it would be about an hour and a half wait. The girl never wrote down our names. After asking a few times about the status they finally seated us. The table was not cleaned. There were crumbs. Once we got the food after about 15 minutes, 2 of our orders were still not ready. I'm not a fan of that. I prefer if the entire table gets their orders at the same time but whatever that wasn't the biggest issue. The water was clearly tap. You can taste it. Some of the food was not seasoned properly. The rice looked bland. My sister was full from her order, shrimp enchiladas. She gave me her plate and while looking at it I noticed a brown cockroach!! Baked right on it. I informed one of the bussers about it and he took the plate to the kitchen. After 10 minutes the waitress comes and asks if she wanted something else other than the enchiladas. My sister said no, she was done eating. The waitress then took it upon herself to make a joke about the situation. \"Its just so weird because we don't have that problem here. Maybe some alacranes or escorpiones pero no cucarachas.\" Excuse me?! One of the guys we were with reminded her that they did have that problem and she just said that it was just a disgruntled customer who made a comment but they didn't have a problem. She then goes to tell the manager that we refuse to pay for that plate. Again 10 minutes later she comes and says \"ok so we are going to review the cameras.\" Thats all I needed to hear. After looking for the manager about 5 minutes he was found at the front registers. He ignored me while i'm trying to speak to him. Once we start talking, he refused to let me speak. He kept going on about how I dont have to worry about paying the check and that they will be checking the cameras because, again, they don't have that problem there. I had enough. I told him to let me speak and then I went off. I don't care about paying clearly I have money to pay if i'm going out to eat. What my issue was is hiding behind that idiotic waitress who thinks its ok to joke about it and then say they will check the cameras as if accusing us of something. WHO CARRIES DEAD COCKROACHES WITH THEM?! Proper customer service would have been to go and apologize immediately after being told what was discovered. Had they apologized, I would not have made such a big deal about it but they didn't and that's what pissed me off.  Not only was service horrible, their bathrooms were disgusting. Overflowing trash cans, dirty sinks. That place should be shut down!!! If i'm ever visiting family in Las Vegas again, I will NOT be returning.",

Anyhow, we decided to have dinner today and give them a try since they denied all allegations, and unfortunately did not go well. We order 4 dishes and one of them in particular was the ceviche in a bowl (can't remember the name but somewhere in the lines of \"limoncito\"). Half way through the ceviche I noticed a long piece of blonde hair. You can imagine my reaction or anyone's reaction on this. We flagged down what seemed to be someone in charge, not the waitress since she didn't return for a while. He was surprised and apologized about the situation and immediately took the plate.  I did not want to continue eating at this point since now crazy thoughts were passing through my head.  The waiter/manager returned with what he said to be a newly prepared ceviche and again apologized about what had occurred. I started looking at the ceviche and guess what I find again....... yes a second, long, blonde hair. By the way I am brunette.  He was already walking away when he get his attention again. At this point I'm like forget it! He seemed confused and was surprised that again a blonde hair was in the plate. I showed him how it was all wrapped around the food. Yes, he apologized but then walked away with more waiters nearby. The waitress then came back and advised that the meal was removed from our bill and that they don't understand how a hair was in the food since all their chefs are males. I told her that obviously it wasn't mine if that's were she was going since I am a straight brunette with no highlights whatsoever. ---- lesson learned everyone, don't go to places who have been closed or on the news due to health and food related problems!!!",

    "text": "For those of you with a short attention span this is a truly remarkable place to eat. See Elizabeth at the bar and order anything you can eat that salsa with. Chorizo and scrambled eggs and huevos rancheros are best in class. And incidentally the coffee is hot, fresh and wonderful.  For the rest of us I will just get all carried away.  Now and then you make a mistake that just goes really well. You know, like discovering flubber or the graphene mixed with a super ball thing (too esoteric???.) Well, we were in Las Vegas for CES and we were looking for the Viva Las Vegas Stamps store for my wife. But first we needed breakfast.  Surprise! There was this garish yellow building called La Mojarra Loca, what appeared to be a Mexican Restaurant that served breakfast. Why not?  Get in an airplane, take a bus or just drive to Las Vegas and stop at this place and eat until your stupid. Get breakfast (Huevos Rancheros or scrambled eggs and chorizo) then go shop or sleep for two hours and go back for lunch.  The chips were fresh and not overcooked, the beans were so good I could have done chips and bean dip and been happy. The two kinds of Salsa are worth bottling and taking home, which I did. I could not make a sound decision so I got Chorizo and scrambled eggs that were warm and filling. So good I did not add any salsa. Then I also ordered Juevos Rancheros an all time favorite of mine. It came with sweet red and green peppers on a delicious tortilla. If you have ever eaten at La Parrrila Suiza (another world class dining experience) you will recognize this flavor.   I was hoping for a taste of each but I ate every morsel and sopped up the rest with the remains of my chorizo and eggs.  I like Coffee and am relatively picky about it. I will drink warmed hot brown water but I really like good coffee and I was not disappointed. Great flavor, hearty and strong with no bitterness.   Ok I understand my next comment is not about food but bathrooms can tell you a lot about attention to detail and overall quality. The men's room was emaculate and looked like a designer had been let loose in there complete with an Orchid. They even got toilet seats with a little handle on the side so you can raise the lid with your foot. That of course assumes you are a more civilized man who doesn't just pee on the seats.  This is a great place to eat and just kick back. If Elizabeth is at the bar get to know her because she knows her food and service. We met both managers as well and it is worth speakng to them because they take this place very seriously, and their pride shows all over it.",

We got the dish for two people. Since we have different eating habits, we asked for the cheese, avocado, etc. on a separate plate, rather than inside the bowl. The waitress was happy to oblige. The tortillas are twice as thick as we are used to and they are served warm and soft. Most of the other diners were Hispanic families celebrating birthdays and such. This is definitely THE place to go. We waited about 25 minutes for a table for two at 2pm on a Sunday. It was worth it! While you're waiting for a table, I recommend going to the bar and ordering a fresh lemonade. It's actually limeade and it's so refreshing. We loved everything about this place and plan to return on our next trip to Vegas.",
