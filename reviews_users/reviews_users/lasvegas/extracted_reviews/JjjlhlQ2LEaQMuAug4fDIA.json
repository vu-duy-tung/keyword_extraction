A sign in Chinese read the following:   \"However frustrated you are, don't forget to smile. However impatient you are, don't forget to be polite. However difficult, don't forget to persevere. However tired you are, don't forget to take care of yourself.\"  Restaurants often deliver great food, but never have I been to one that has also delivered words of wisdom. Thanks for the reminder, Yi Mei Deli!",

Beef noodle soup (plain broth) - Very flavorful, delicious.  Stinky tofu - avoid.  More like plain fried tofu.  Oyster Omelette - Something wasn't right about this dish, maybe they used the wrong starch?  Taste was okay.  Service was above average for a Chinese restaurant.  Price was very fair.

    "text": "Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).    Soybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.  Rice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.  Temple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.  Spicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.  Leek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.  Items that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits.   Not sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex.",

I came here with my family and the meal was absolutely delicious (and to Emily R: the menu is just fine; items are understandable; there are just some things that are lost in translation).   The beef noodle soup was full of beef. Not only that, but this beef was so deliciously tender. The noodles were infinitely better than Lawrence described... The soup was very lite, and not oily like many beef noodle soups that I've had before; the noodles weren't overcooked or undercooked. For an appetizer, I ordered the beef  tendon and that was very flavorful (I ordered it spicy) and was a pretty large order for the $2.50 that we paid for it. We also ordered a handful of other items off the menu like shao bing, fan tuan, soy milk, and a few other pastries and they all were excellent for the price. Everything was flavorful, but not overwhelmingly so at any point. The soy milk they serve plain so you're able to add sugar to your liking (just like in Taiwan!). No corn syrup crap here.  I would come here over and over again if I lived in the area but alas, it's an 8+ hr drive from where I live :(  Don't know if any claims on Yelp mean anything, but my family is Taiwanese too and we enjoyed the meal so that might mean something...?",

If you're craving for some Chinese breakfast or Taiwanese street food in the early hours, you can come to to try your luck.   The reason I said so coz their service was really ridiculous.  Someone took our orders but never asked us if we need something to drink. It wasn't busy at all by the time we came. We asked for 3 Glases of water but the server only brought us two after a while. And then he brought us the 3rd one after another while. And he didn't reply us by words so we didn't actually know if he heard us or not.  Foodwise, it's alright.  I was never expected that you can really found some real authentic Taiwanese street food in Vegas, so it's really alright.  I am pretty sure I won't be back here again.",

They close whenever they run out of food for the day, so if you go at 3pm don't be upset if they're closed.  Closing varies slightly.  They're located in the inner corner of a little strip mall, not directly on the road.  Chinese & English menu, breakfast is served all day (not just 7-9am or so).  I am so happy to have found my Taiwanese eatery here in Vegas, feels like home again.  Such good food.",

You know, I feel bummed whenever I fly into Vegas earlier than 8am because unlike the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal, I struggle to find places to eat a traditional HK style or Taiwanese style breakfast.  Why is it so?  There are so many of our people here now..... Then I came across this neat restaurant in the heart of Chinatown that satisfied my need.  They have hot soy milk, plain steamed porridge, pancakes of most variety, Chinese donut and meat rolls.  The kinds of stuff I was looking for and the prices are more than reasonable.   Now off to the gym then business....",

Well open your mind to a slightly different experience: tawainese breakfast! It's slightly different than dim sum but not so different that you'll be confused. There's XLB, there's bao, there's chinese doughnuts, there's all kinds of spicy nom noms, there's something for everyone! Seriously!  We came here on a Sunday morning, hungry. We left the opposite of hungry. The service was friendly if a little slow to get started. We liked the ample parking and the fact that a Chinese tour group showed up right after we did (they ate their breakfast like champions - truly impressive intake) and that we were the only native English speakers there.  Most importantly we liked the food and appreciated the good advice we got from our server. And the bill was reasonable too. :)  Enjoy life. Regret nothing. Eat at Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. You'll be the champion when you do.",

My favorite dish: Egg Pancake.  This past visit, we ordered almost one of everything on the menu, so I might miss a few descriptions of some of the food items.  Both steamed and pan fried pork dumplings were served with a sweet ginger vinegar sauce. The dumplings were juicy and full of flavour. These dishes tasted amazing.  There were a few other pan fried dishes, but my favourite was the egg pancake and oyster pancake. The egg pancake had a layer of pan fried egg on top of a green onion pancake. The flavors just mesh so well together. The oyster pancake was thin and chewy just as it is supposed to be. The sauce for the oyster pancake is hard to master, but complimented the pancake so well.   Overall, I recommend making time to try this restaurant. Since most of the food is carb-y, it is also great for breakfast the morning after drinking. I would recommend any dish in the menu, and you won't be disappointed.",

Being that we would take food vacations to taipei we walked into Yi Mei with some trepidation.  Now before I continue on, I do want to mention that HK is not actually a great place for taiwanese food (or else we wouldnt go on foodie trips to taipei).  We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup.  Had a little bit of heat but not sweating sort of spicy.  Which was great because it had a great taste that would've been covered up had it been too spicy.  Very nice!  It was also quite big, I am used to the little paper bowls of beef noodle soup in the alleyways of taiwan, not the american sized portions.  Couldnt finish it all and the waitress (the owners grand daughter) was great and brought me 2 containers 1 for the soup the other for the noodles so it wouldnt go all soggy together.    My wife ordered the steamed pork rice.  I knew it was good as soon as she declared \"I'm not sharing!\"  Of course she did and it was very good we were impressed.   My wife had the cold soy milk and enjoyed it I ordered the hot and had to put sugar in it, home made and nice. everything was home made and it was like having a personal taiwanese grandma cooking for us.  Then onto the Xiao Lum Bao.  the filling was good the skin a little thick and not enough \"soup\" inside the dumpling.  These took awhile but they were by far the best I have had in the USA.  Din Tai Fun sets a very high bar,we have gone to the DTF in taipei, shenzen, hong kong, singapore and jakarta (no pork at DTF in jakarta no pork dumplings suck).  Great food, nice family atmosphere place.  We will be going back anytime we plan on going to the 168 market for shopping.",

    "text": "Hooray, they were open on Chrstmas day!  Thank goodness I can count  Chinese to be working on the holidays!  Came in for a quick bite before my flight.  I got there around 8 am and the place was relatively empty.  I knew I had lucked out since that would not last.  The waitress handed me a menu and told me there would be no noodles until later in the day.  Good, since that means they are making it fresh, bad since I was craving some noodles.  Oh well.  I ordered the sweet soy milk (x2), steamed soup dumplings, onion pancake with egg, and a beef roll.  Everything came out rather quickly, that was good since I was on a time crunch.  The sweet soy milk was actually unsweetened and warm.  There was sugar on the table so I was able to sweeten it to my liking.  There was also a thin film on top, according to my mom, it is similar to tofu, very authentic, and the best part.  The steamed soup dumplings were good, the skins were a little thick this morning and they could have served it with more ginger.  The beef roll had lots of oninons and hoisin sauce and the pancake it came warpped in wasn't too thick.  The most lacking dish was the onion pancake.  It was very bland, I think the egg made it more so, to the point I sprinkled salt on it.  There weren't a lot of onions in it and instead of being crispy on the outside, it was soft throughout.  Service was efficient, and no one seemed grouchy for having to work on Christmas day.  And the staff spoke my dialect of Chinese, without any heavy accent, just like being in Taipei.  The entire bill for all my food was less than $20, a definite bargain.  Overall, a great place to eat and be reminded of home.",

They did not filter the soybeans out of it and there was grinded up soybean gunk and slime in our bowls and it clung to our spoons.  The aftertaste was even worse.    The selections for other breakfast foods were not as expected for chinese breakfast places.  We wanted a single order of red bean bun, and found out that we had to order a min of 6 at $5.99 total.  Glad we did not order that b/c if it tasted anything like the soybean milk, we would have been highly disappointed.    we will not be going back.",

    "text": "I might come back if i ever feel like eating my favorite again.    The owner of this restaurant is the same one from Champion on Spring Mountain Rd.  It's in the same mall of the old SF supermarket.    Please don't let the their service discourage you from visiting this place again.  This is how their service works.  When you get there, they don't really seat you, you just find a spot to sit, get your own water from the dispenser and grab your own utensils for food.  You can either go up to the counter to get their menu or you can wait for them.  Either way.  Their service isn't the best but that's how they roll.  I'm only giving this place 2 stars because I've read the review from someone else about this place and he said that they didn't have some of the items on the menu.  So I decided to wait a few days afterwards to go.  But, the items that were unavailable from the previous review, was still UNAVAILABLE.  This makes me wonder, if they even have the man power to run a business like this.  Why did they advertise Taiwanses deli when they don't have soy drinks? Why they don't have shao lung bao? Waitress said to me that since they are so busy, the chef is unable to make the shao lung bao.  (Oh really?  Do you want the business from me? Seriuosly?  No? I guess not!)    It just doesn't make sense to me why they don't hire more people to help outside and inside of the kitchen?  Why don't they better prepare themselves? They've been in business for a while week already and not to mention, they only moved over from their previous business, so they have experience already.    I then suddenly remember how the sluggish atmosphere is like from the old champion restaurant.  It's the exact same thing.  They probably want to improve business but don't really know how to handle a busy business within their management.    I want to review on their dam dam mein.  It used to taste really good at the old location, and i expected it to be the same. But it didnt' taste the same.  Not only did they not have the appropriate  that they were supposed to serve , the peanut sauce was really bland.    They didn't have soy that i wanted to drink, they didn't have the siu lung bao, that i wanted.  I ordered my normal favorite and it turned out horrible.  I also ordered the Beef noodle which didn't taste great either.    Over all, i was really disappointed in their management.  I hope their services will improve in the future.  I will not be back there for a while.",

    "text": "We went to have Taiwanese breakfast on Sunday morning. We got there just before 11:30am and they served breakfast only until 11:30am. It was after 11:30am by the time we got a table (it was packed in there), but luckily they still took our order for the breakfast special. It consisted of hot soya bean milk, Chinese donut, and a pastry bun. This typical Taiwanese breakfast combo was not bad for $3.99. The soya bean was very strong flavor and made fresh at the restaurant. The Chinese deep fried donut was not quite up to par, not chewy and holey enough, but okay. The pastry bun was flaky, although for my taste buds, I would prefer it to be filled with some sort of meat. We also ordered xiu long bao, salty rice roll and a beef sandwich. The xiu long bao was quite tasty, but a little on the small size. The salty rice roll which consists of glutinous rice wrapped around a Chinese donut with dried pork jerky was not bad. It tastes quite good, but the Chinese donut inside was overcooked and a little too hard for my liking. Lastly, the beef sandwich had slices of marinated beef in the pastry bun. It didn't come with any sauce, so to me the sandwich was on the dry side. The flavor of the beef could also be improved. So overall, I think this place is only deserving of 2.5 stars. Oh, one last note, although they have waitress to serve you, they also have a table at the side, where you can pick up your own plastic utensils, napkins and get your own water to drink. Pretty weird huh?",

    "text": "Don't mind the 3 star rating. This place is de-ricious.  What's up with everyone giving this place 2-3 stars because the \"service was terrible\". My family and I went here twice in one day and did not experience anything remotely close to bad service, despite every table being taken. In fact, the owner of the place actually came over and had a 15 minute conversation about how the place got start, what types of dishes we should try and what other places we should check out in the area.   I took my parents to Vegas for the first time. The only request that they had was to check out Chinatown (yes, my parents are lame). I looked up a breakfast place to eat and found Yi Mei. I was a fan of the other locations in Southern California, so I decided to take them there. We were greeted right away and wait about 2-3 minutes for them to clear off a table. Unlike the other locations that I've been to, they had a huge menu included lunch & dinner items. I want apologize in advance, since I have to translate the dishes from Chinese to English and completely making the food sound unappetizing. We ordered a variety of things...soy milk (sweet and salty), Taiwanese style donut, scallion pancake, beef sandwich, \"meat round\" (Taiwanese dish with meat filling wrapped by a translucent rice cake). I have to say, growing up with Taiwanese food and living in Taiwan for a year, this place is as authentic as it gets. The food is made fresh to order and they do it very well. With all the food we ordered, the total was still less than 30 dollars.   If you want a nice break from the expensive casino food, this place is a great option.   A little about my credentials:  I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian  Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.",

    "text": "Sadness can only be cured with fried Chinese Doughnuts and Hot Soy Milk. An early trip to drop off my sister to the airport alloted me an hour before I had to get to work. An hour is a strange amount of time. Not enough to devout too much time to any activity, but long enough to make it difficult to fill.   My job is close to Chinatown and I have wanted to try Taiwanese breakfast. I love my hot soy milk ($1.75) and youtiao ($1.75). Other than that, I am not familiar with this style of dining. The soy milk is thin and comes plain. The waitress told me that I would need to add sugar to sweeten it. Maybe after some of the reviews saying it was too sweet got them to just serve it this way. I am a fan of self service and added just a little to lightly adjust the flavor. Unsure about the sizes of the dishes here, I decided to order one at a time. Lucky, for me, because the Egg Cake and Chinese Doughnuts ($4.75) is a bountiful feast. One stick of two doughnuts are wrapped in a large egg pancake. When the waitress came around, she had many little plates on a tray and dealt them out to multiple tables. I eyed the largest plate and wondered what it was. Wonder no more, because it was mine. I debated on whether or not to finish my meal, but the perfectly brown dough begged not to be wasted. The savory and soft egg gave amazing textural contrast to the deep fried bread. They fry them up to order, because on the bottom of my plate, there was a little puddle of oil. Usually this is a turn off, but the taste makes it easy to overlook a normal infraction.  At $7.03, I ended up with a delicious meal at fast food prices. I would like to come back and try some of the pickled mustard green or vegetable buns.   For a large restaurant, there is only one waitress attending to guest and cashiering. She apologized a few times for the wait time, but it was nothing to get hung up over.",

Yeah, it's pretty hard to screw up the soybean milk and oil sticks, but it's pretty hard to find that combination here in Vegas so I am giving them 4* on that. Those prices that I have next to the items are a la carte prices. Right now, they do have a breakfast special, which is the soybean milk, Chinese donuts, and baked sandwich fir $3.99, which saves almost a dollar.

I was not very happy to see that they cater to large groups like that, because the limited time we have.   It took awhile before we ordered, but the food came out quick. All the items we ordered were pre-made anyway. We ordered 2 hot soy milk, 2 youtiao(fried dough), 1 shaobing( baked sesame cake). The food was pretty good. I was disappointed that they don't offer the special anymore though.",

    "text": "Hands down the best Taiwanese deep fried pork chop I've ever had. The pork chop was huge, tender, not greasy or overly breaded. I finished the entire plate, was stuffed and was still gnawing on the bone like a caveman afterwards. The minced pork and egg over the rice was fantastic. One thing that was lacking entirely however  is the pickled veggies. My wife ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. Also tasty and tender. Her only complaint was that they cut all the noodles so they're pretty short. The steamed dumplings were good however I wished there was more hot broth inside of it. Overall we were very impressed. This will be our go to lunch spot on all our Vegas trips from now on.",

    "text": "I woke up this Sunday morning with a craving for fried donut and wonton soup.  My mom and I went to Wendy's noodle cafe and realized they only open for lunch.  So we decided to try this place since I've read some reviews and heard about this place from a few friends.    I cannot understand how people are giving this place 4 or 5 stars.   Where do I begin...first the service was horrible.  Right after we came in I realized this is one of those places where you seat yourself.  I don't have a problem with that so we picked a table.   After 10 minutes wait we still hadn't seen any service in the entire dining area so I went to the counter while thinking maybe this is a place where you order at the counter and serve yourself.  The lady at the counter told me she'll come right out to take our order.  Another 5 minutes later a different waitress came out and started taking order from a group of people who came in after us.  So I had to go to the counter again and the waitress who told me she'd be right out was just hanging there doing nothing.    Very much like the service the food was also a disappointment.  I wanted something soupy but they didn't have any soup (including the beef noodle soup) available for breakfast.  So I ordered fried donut, beef pancake and soy milk.  The fried dough (or donut) was probably the worst I've had.  Part of it was overly crunchy and the rest was like chewing on paper.    The beef pancake came out in saran wrap which made it look not freshly made.  It's not horrible but I've definitely had better ones (like the one in China Ma Ma).  The taste was bland and I had to use a lot of hot sauce.  The flaky outside was so crispy that it just fell all over on the table when I tried to unwrap it.  What a mess.    I expected soy milk but I think she brought me the soy tofu thing.  Anyway the dish already had fried donuts in there.  Any decent waitress would warn the customers that they may not need the additional order of fried donut but apparently not here.  The dish was below average from presentation to taste.    Overall I don't think there's anything about this place that will make me go back.  They may have better things for lunch or dinner but I don't really care about finding that out.",

We mainly went for noodles, but we didn't know that noodle dishes are not available until lunch time.  It definitely worked out because the server recommended the pot stickers.  1.  Pot Stickers - Juicy lil' baby morsels of meat and add in the crispy fried skin 2.  Juicy Pork Dumplings - improvement!  the meat wasn't as salty.  the skin was thinner, which is better in my mind.  juicier but still not as juicy as din tai fung caliber  Conclusion:  up 1 star for improvement and juicy and flavor factors!",

The only benefit you may get is the opportunity to have some traditional Chinese breakfast. They have a lot of choices, mainly from Taiwan and Tianjin. The staff were extremely inefficient and inattentive. We complained a few times about the speed of getting our food, but nobody cared and a boy waiter even coldly said \"talk to whoever took your order\" (although he clearly knew who took our order, he even did not tell that waitress who kept staying behind the counter when walked by). One star given to the choice of food, but would strongly advise this restaurant to get improved.",

But this place is a small, family owned place, that only makes up for the shabby appearance by the quality food. I will say that it gave it an authentic feel - grandpa was sitting at the table next to us packaging freshly roasted peanuts and I'm pretty sure I saw grandma back in the kitchen. Definitely coming back here, I only hope I can replicate the amazing meal I had here without help ordering. But then again, even  the dishes that I'd normally avoid (because I don't know much about authentic Taiwanese cuisine) like the oyster pancake/omelette, were so surprisingly good! My friend lives in DC and kept saying she couldn't believe the authentic dishes they served because she had otherwise only had them when she was actually in Taiwan.",

Here's what we ordered:  oyster pancake - bleh bleh bleh.  the sauce was was REALLY cinnamon-y, and not thick enough.  It really didn't taste like oh ah jian (forgive me, I don't know ping ying) at all.  Plus, it was 7 whopping bucks.  dan bing (egg pancake) - really eggy, but the bing wasn't crispy enough.  it's hard to mess up dan bing though.  salty soy milk (shian do jiang) - VERY tasty.  It's a small-ish bowl, but for 3 bucks, it's not bad.  Lots of vinegar and pork sung.  Would definitely order again.  pork chop rice - The pork chop was okay (but I'm not a huge fan of pork chop), but the seasoned pork and vegetable on the side (the zho zhau) was REALLY good.   stewed pig ear and bean curd - this tasted pretty much like you would expect.  Decent flavor, though the bean curd was a bit on the salty side.  They have tons of other breakfast items that we didn't get a chance to try, but will update once we come back.  I would have given this place 4 stars if not for that horrid oyster pancake.  Plus, any place that serves decent taiwanese food in the middle of the desert is alright in my book! :)",

I've seen some people review that the service isn't great or that the owner is snappy, but for us she was very accommodating with us (with that somewhat curt attitude lol). So at least to me, if you look past that, service is great.   Food is pretty good, not too salty. Only the quantity is somewhat smaller than I hoped. The radish pancake only came with two pieces, and the beef roll was only three pieces, although it came with pickled cucumber and cabbage.   I'll keep this place in mind, I'd come back to check out the lunch menu.   One thing that I did appreciate about this place is the reason it has it's hours so short. Sure, it's short and only in the morning (they close at 3PM). The reason is because the owner can then go home and spend time with her dad and cook for him too. She does accommodate people who may want to come in later. She had a party call in maybe a couple days before saying they wanted to bring people there but it would be after closing time, maybe around 4PM. With that heads up, she was willing to open up for them. Quite nice!",

I'm excited that I will soon be able to get this kind of food when I move to Vegas though; it's already a huge step up from what's available in Richmond, VA.  The inside is very simple and casual and has several tables. Service is mediocre, and I didn't expect much, but usually Taiwanese people are more friendly (granted, some of the waitresses were mainland Chinese).   The menu is extensive and prices are very reasonable, so that's a plus. I ordered the salty rice ball, salty soymilk, and pickled cucumber appetizer (please see my photo captions for the exact dish names as they are listed in the menu). The fried dough stick () inside the salty rice ball was not crispy at all, which was a bit disappointing. Salty soymilk was decent, but I've had much better (and there was no white vinegar on the table or served with it if you wanted to add some). The pickled cucumbers were great though!  Overall, portions are generous for the price (i.e. good value) and the food is not bad, but I guess I just had higher expectations. I will still be back to try more off the menu.",

    "text": "New location on Spring Mountain and Arville (across the street from Sushi Kaya).  It may be a bit difficult to come here if you are not familiar with Taiwanese cuisine, as the menu is non-descriptive and there is a bit of a language barrier. I get by using Yelp photos to determine what I will be eating and blindly choosing an item. Yi Mei Champion seems popular for a typical Taiwanese breakfast. I've noticed that this is usually composed of their salted soy milk or salted bean curd, which is are light soy-saucey broths with tofu and some pork floss for saltiness. I add chili oil and it's nice, warm, and homey tasting. Order some extra oily Chinese fried donuts to dip into it! May not be super healthy, but it's super comforting.  Other things my boyfriend and I have tried: -Noodle dishes have been good.. can't give much advice on how to order these as we randomly chose them. -Radish w/ eggs. More like a soft dough fried in eggs. I enjoy this.  -Chili oil bean curd- very salty, buttery tofu with a hint of spice. Good to eat with rice or spread on something bland. -Beef roll - pass. dry and pre-made. Nothing special.  I saw a lady near the front making large crepe-looking dishes with a gooey looking dough. Didn't get a chance to ask about it.. but I would totally appreciate if anyone knows and would like to enlighten me about it!  Don't expect amazing service. Do expect quick and homey food that is cheap.",

So we decided to come here and try some dishes. We ordered Oyster omelet and rice cake bowl with a few other dishes.  The rice cake bowl was probably the worse I've ever had and everything else was just ok at best.  Maybe we didn't try the best they had to offer but these are the staples of Taiwanese food.  Prices were high too.  Will try a different place next time we're in Vegas.",

My Taiwanese spouse loved the food especially the oyster dish and found the food very authentic Taiwanese. I had the spicy beef noodle soup which comes in a large bowl. It was a bit spicy but delicious. We ordered quite a bit of food and the cost was very good for the amount of food we had. I would recommend.",

The kicker is when I found a strand of hair in my xiao long bao. I was completely turned off after that. I didn't tell my waiter because he seemed like a nice guy, but it's unappetizing to find things like that especially for breakfast when you're barely awake. Not sure if I will return.",

All their tables are large fitted for family so no worries if you have a big group.   Our orders were taken quickly, water was brought out as soon as we asked for it, and food came out within minutes! Their minced pork over rice was so good! Great flavors and great portion, came out super quick...can be a little greasy but that is what makes it so good!  The pork chop rice was HUGE! Came with minced pork also, veggies and was big enough for two to share. The beef roll was also good, came with pickled cucumbers and fermented cabbage that was similar to kim-chi.   I didn't really care for the oyster omelet with the sauce on top, their soup dumpling was decent, juicy but the lacked in flavor a little.   Overall i will definitely come back for the rice and I really want to try their breakfast items. We used to always go to this other place for Taiwanese style breakfast, although that place was good they get really busy and food takes awhile. Looking forward to trying the breakfast menu here.",

My first experience here was great, I came with a fellow yelper, Mike C. and had him order everything. My order came out and everything fine.  My second visit was a desperate one. I originally stopped by Asian BBQ and noodles but they're closed on Fridays :( So...I decided to drive across the street.   I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked if they could add wontons in it...weird I know but I was craving both. First they brought out a bowl of wontons in beef broth which is understandable and forgivable because of the language barrier. They took it back...added the beef and the noodles...everything looked great until I started eating. The wontons were falling apart as soon as I tried picking them up with my chopsticks. I was starving so I ignored this and continued eating until I bit into one of the wontons and realized that it was still pink...undercooked. Gross...-_-  The service here is non existent... They have a water cooler and Styrofoam cups if you need water... Feel free to walk up and get it yourself. Same goes for napkins.   This experience was probably an extreme of how bad a meal could go wrong here...but I will not be back. This decision was made after considering that the first visit was decent. There are just too many better options in the area.",

Not like the beef rolls I've had before. It looks really tasty but it didn't taste like anything. I would not get this again. I'd try the beef pocket instead. I saw other people eating that + it looked delicious. - salted rice roll: my favorite thing + I don't know why it's not more common, like onigiri...anyways perfect rice to meat floss to Chinese donuts proportions.

I guess they sell out by the afternoon? The thing is that they can buy it at the 99 Ranch Market almost right next door. We settled for the minced pork with rice.   We also ordered two different types of noodle bowls- the noodles with the dumplings and thin noodles.  The food overall was not too bad.   The portions were huge; we couldn't finish everything. The prices were cheap compared to Southern California.",

    "text": "I've been on the hunt for a good Taiwanese restaurant and decided to try out this place based on their reviews. I have to say that my experience was mediocre.   From the reviews that I read, the service sounded like it was terrible and even worse for people who can't speak Taiwanese. That wasn't the case for me because as I came in with my husband and 2 kids we seated ourselves and within a few minutes we had someone come to take our order. I don't speak Taiwanese so I ordered everything in English and the girl who took my order understood everything. Maybe I got lucky that day!   Within 5-10 minutes our food started coming out and everything was out within 10 minutes. I was pretty happy about that! We ordered a variety of things because I wanted to try out my favorite dishes: green onion pancake, oyster omelette, juicy pork dumplings, and beef noodle soup. I also ordered the hot soybean milk... Which was so fresh and delicious! Made me feel like a kid again!   Here's a breakdown of the food: 1) green onion pancake- too thick for my liking. I like the thinner and crispier ones. The flavor was good but it was a little too doughy for me. 2) oyster omelette- the omelet itself was great! But the sauce they put on top was too sweet. 3) juicy pork dumplings- amazing. Perfect. The ginger soy dipping sauce complemented the dumplings perfectly. I will come back for more! 4) spicy beef noodle soup- it was good and not too spicy. I wish they gave me more of the pickled mustard greens though.   So was this one of the best Taiwanese restaurants I've been to? No... But the prices are good and the food, well, you just have to try it to see if you like it more than not.",

The stinky tofu tastied just like regular fried tofu.  The beef stew noodle soup was delicious, probably the best seller in the store, the oyster egg pancake smelled fishy, not recommended.    But they also serve soy milk, with pastry, so if you're craving that it's probably a dependable place to go to.",

It is rather hard for me to not enjoy them unless they are really badly prepared. (something I have yet to experience)  Yi Mei is one of the few off the strip places that open super early. There were no wait when I arrived before 9 but the restaurant was quickly filled to capacity an hour later.  I think 3.5 stars is a fairly accurate rating for Yi Mei. It is much better than 3 but not quite 4 stars yet. Soybean milk and fan tuan (rice roll) were nicely done. The leek filling pancake was a bit too hard and too oily. Steamed Pork and Vegetable Bun was generous in portion and quite tasty. Taiwan Style Rice Wrapped was just average.  I was quite happy with the breakfast at Yi Mei. Pretty sure I will return next time and try out more of their other dishes.",

    "text": "Taiwanese style breakfast in Vegas what else can you expect?  A piece of my hometown food at way cheaper than tourist food on the stripe?! I take two!!  Came here on the most crowded days- Christmas weekend, ladies in the house were in commend and obviously in good mood.  Saw them giving kids rice cracker cookies, one big package per child- well Merry Christmas and here is when you say the reason you love Taiwanese people:).   Packed house and yet very efficient.  One tradition about Chinese dinning is that you need to be able to stand other guests staring at you and giving you a very clear hint of hurry up that we want to sit down look.  Don't be offended, that's part of the culture.  You gotta not be shy and be flexible in the seating, that could range from share table to servers bussing your table so quickly that you get that you can't hang out and take your time.  In our case, we are two people so the best chance to grab a quick bite is to let them know we are willing to share table.  Both days we waited for less than 5 minutes.  Oh, and politeness always work in your favor, I smile and wish them Merry Christmas, got the tables ahead of whole grumpy bunch who complaint that they waited 30 minutes.    We order all the vegetarian spread, ranging from soy milk (comes plain, sugar bottle on the table for customized sweetness), Chinese donut ,classic rice ball, vege bun, egg pancake, second day I had porridge with some classic tapas like fermented tofu cube and cucumber salad.  Hit the spot, nothing extraordinary but everything nostalgic.  I can't really complaint when my homies open the doors at 7am to serve these massive crazy amount of hungry people.  I am grateful for these hard working servers and cooks and looking forward for this classic ritual again next time when I am in Vegas!",

    "text": "It was Sunday and we were coming off our high of an exciting and fun weekend in Vegas.  It only seemed appropriate for us to \"sober up\" with some traditional Taiwanese breakfast foods.  The place was slightly out of the way but we were still up and at 'em early enough to avoid those who waiting until check-out time to run for the CA border.  It wasn't busy which was a relief (possibly due to its location) and when we walked in, we were promptly given a clean and spacious table.  The restaurant isn't big but it wasn't crowded either.  We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff.  The best of which were: Egg cake with Chinese donut - we thought the egg cake would be wrapped around one Chinese donut but it was two.  Massive!  and we ordered 3 of them!! Taiwan-style stir fried rice noodles - topped with a meat sauce...totally reminded me of home. Stinky tofu - not too stinky but the garlic soy sauce paste they serve with it was so yummy, the tofu ended up being a vehicle for the soy sauce instead of the other way around. Tofu custard soup (salty) - looks almost like a hot and sour soup.  some people might find it bland but I couldn't get enough of it Cold soybean milk - very fresh and tasty, natural  The not as impressive: Oyster pancake - I noticed they used clams.  CLAMS!  That's very different from oysters and make the pancake very terrible.  The sauce they used was also too sweet. Taiwan-style \"meat ball\" - this is really some ground up meat and bamboo shoots inside a skin made of rice flour so it's chewier.  Texturally, it was good.  The meat itself was seasoned well.  Unfortunately, they used the same sauce on it as on the oyster pancake - too sweet! Steam pork/veggie bun - I didn't personally try this but my friends said it was dry. Milk tea - they used some wierd condensed milk which threw off the taste of the tea and it was further ruined by the fact they didn't use Taiwanese black tea (red tea in Chinese).  Service was very good and friendly with the owner/lady coming over to chat with us briefly.  We thanked them a lot and they thanked us a lot and in the end, everyone was happy.  I hope we can make this a Vegas tradition!",

It's rare to see a place that serves Taiwanese breakfast at 7:00AM everyday throughout the week... as least not many places like that on the east coast. In terms of quality, the FOOD IS GREAT! It also has a great variety of Taiwanese items. My favorite are there rice rolls. And yes, plural, because there are FIVE different kind of rice rolls! Yi Mei and Champion Rice Rolls are the best! Everything we tried were pretty good... steam pork & veg bun, sweet bean curd, radish bun, Taiwanese meat ball, and leek dumplings. We had a variety of steam buns to go... and all of them were great! Pork and Mushroom and Vegetarian are must tries! Really like how they had sweet cold soil milk readily available - taste great!  Didn't try any of the non-breakfast stuff probably because the breakfast were sooo good, but I'm sure the other items are just as excellent. In general, the price is a little on the high side for Taiwanese food, but it's worth it! Really would like to try the pork chop rice next time.",

    "text": "This is probably the best Chinese food around here. Everything on the menu is authentic and I oh have been to Taiwan or southern part of China then you will know it is soooooo gooood.  We ordered classical Taiwan noodle soup and xiaolongbao at dine in. To be honest I think I should have ordered the tender version of beef noodle soup because the meat is kinda hard to chew, however the noodle and the soup are just sooooo good. It uses the original broth from beef soup and unlike other Chinese restaurants they put little salt and it's much healthier. They also have the bok choy in the soup which you know is typical and good. Xiaolongbao is more southern taste like Shanghai and it is as good if not better than dingtaifeng  After this extraordinary food experience we then ordered more to go so that next morning we wouldn't be starving. We ordered Taiwan sausage rice -- turns out to be soooo good that we finished most of it before the picture. It has eggs and Taiwanese sausage, side vegetable and braised egg on top of the rice. So gooooood.  We also ordered onion Chinese pancake and egg, shaobing and egg, and stinky tofu.  One thing to note is that we should be ordering only one of the pancake and egg, because we were too full in the morning and could not finish all.  The other thing to notice is that stinky tofu is a must try here. I don't see any other restaurants have authentic ones, this one has it and it is more Shanghai style, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside, alone side the provided pickled vegetable and the garlic onion sauce, it is just extraordinary and tasty.  I rated five stars based on the food quality and the satisfactory I had and my wife had.",

The Yi Mei is very different from the Yi Mei in Rowland Heights so I assume that this is also a brandname pirate. The customer service offers typical Chinese brusqueness, but they provide the necessities as required. We really enjoyed the breakfast items - the salty rice roll (chinese donut and pork sung wrapped in glutinous rice), egg pancake (their egg was thick and fluffy), soy milk, turnip cake (each plate comes with two thick pieces) and beef scallion roll (the roll was very pale and bland - least favourite item). We also tried their beef noodle soup (clear soup version), oyster pancake (decent, but can't compare to Taiwan's...) and stinky tofu (aka stinking tofu on the menu). My favourite lunch item was the stinky tofu with pickled cabbage. I also suggest checking out the cold dish items. We tried the mini dried fish with tofu and beef tendon, which were both very tasty and had a good kick to them. I highly recommend this as a day after meal!",

Delicious and authentic with a good menu selection. The first time here I got the green onion pancake with egg, jook, and three cup chicken over rice. It also comes with a little bit of vegetables and an egg. The second time I got the green onion pancake and an order of fried rice noodles with meat sauce and egg. My mom tried the rice noodles and approved.  Only reason I can't give it five stars is because the food is too salty. A solid place overall.",

They weren't rude or anything, except this one lady who was too busy to answer my question, but you have to go to the front to order and pay or you will wait forever for them to come to your table. Also don't expect them to be nice and patient. You better be ready to go with minimal questions.    Food:  Salted bean curd:  5 stars. Really interesting. It's salty tofu pudding with a savory broth and chinese donut. Will order it again and it was only 3 bucks  Yi mei rice roll:  4. Pretty decent. I think it needs more kimchee in it. basically it's a sticky rice roll with a fried chinese donut, kimchee and savory pork shreds. A staple breakfast item in Taiwan.   Beef roll:  3 stars. I really liked the cucumbers and kimchee that came with it. 5 stars for the side dishes. But the beef roll itself wasn't that good. The green onion pancakes it was rolled in was super chewy and flavorless. Not flaky crunchy and savory like it's supposed to be. Also the beef is tendonous, which adds to the chewiness. There's no sauce or in the rolls. Usually there's a sweet hoisin sauce but this one doesn't have any.   Shanghai dumplings:  2 stars. It's very different. Some of the skin breaks so all the juices leak out before you even touch it. I would say at least 3 out of the 8 had no juice. The ones with the juice/soup tastes different from the more traditional Shanghai dumplings. This one seems to have a very strong pork and soy sauce flavor but that's about it. Wouldn't order it again.   I gave it 4 stars because I do want to come back to try other things and I think that this place is a really good deal. All the food listed came it to 22 dollars and the two of us were very very full. Also once you order, food comes hella quick!",

Errant summer storm in Las Vegas. I scurried in from the parking lot and it was so nice to have an order of freshly made soy milk plopped down in front of me. Odd that it was served in a big soup bowl but it was piping hot and fragrant and i didn't hesitate to try it. I added some sugar to it as directed by the waitress and drank it like soup with my fat Chinese spoon. Wonder why they don't serve it in a cup or mug? Oh well if this is how they do it in Taiwan then this is how I'll do it here.   Choices, choices, so many choices. I had the worst time trying to decide what to order. Everything sounded so promising and fun. Yelp photos helped me settle on the spicy beef noodle soup but I added a twist and ordered the one that had tendons in it and I am glad I did.  Forget bone marrow it's all about tendons! I love the melt in your mouth texture. I googled tendon nutritional value and found that tendons are high in protein, collagen and are 99% fat free.  Choo chooo put me on the Tendon Train. Delicious.  I also had the temple meatball which was really flavorful and had a fantastic texture. Highly recommend that dish. The only dish I wasn't very fond of was the rice ball roll thing(sorry don't know names) I asked for something to go that was easy to eat while driving and the waitress recommended it. It was also something I saw a photo of on yelp and people seemed to enjoy it but I found it unhealthy tasting. Everything I ate up to that point tasted clean and healthy but this had fried components that made me feel bad about myself afterwards.  Bummer. I still give the place 5 stars for everything else.  I can't help it if my palate seems adverse to fried food. Others seem to enjoy the fried stuff just fine.",

The service used to be ok, since the owner who is a really nice Taiwanese lady served me couple time. However, this time when I went there was HORRIBLE! The first second I walked into the restaurant, there was another Taiwanese elderly lady standing behind the cashier. She was staring at me without any welcoming smile when I was walking to her. When I was standing right in front of her, she didn't greet with me and kinda waiting for me to greet with her. And she gave me a really irritating face! Then she lift up her chin a little bit and blinked in the most annoying way I've ever seen. Ok, I ignored that. Then I told her what I wanted to order for to-go. Then, there's another young male customer came to the cashier and asked for a check. She gave him a very bright smile and called him \"handsome boy\" in Chinese and finished his transaction before me. Really! The guy came after me!!!!!  Ok, I ignored that too. When she handled me my food, she said \"shiiiit!\" In English. She said it really loud. I didn't really know if she was saying that to me or for something else, but it's still rude to curse in front of a customer. She is definitely the rudest and the most miserable person I've ever met in my entire life. I didn't do anything or showed any disrespect to her from the very beginning to the end. I even said \"thank you\" after all of this. Btw, last time me and my bf were there for breakfast, they undercooked the wonton. And it smelled wired.  I will NEVER put my feet in this restaurant, and I don't recommend this place to any of you. If you love your life, stay away from this place!!!!",

We finally had the opportunity to have a late Saturday lunch together, courtesy of this Taiwanese deli. Initially, we were going off of her dim sum craving, but decided to try something different. *cue my devious plan to suggest one of my many Yelp bookmarks*  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, we decided on the pork chop rice and the three cup chicken rice. Didn't take very long to get our food and man, their portions are HUGE. One of our entrees could've fed two or three people, so you should either come famished or bring a friend! We ended up splitting the crispy fried pork chop and taking the other entree home. Both dishes had their respective meats, some steamed or blanched vegetables, a large helping of rice, and a soy sauce egg. Mmm, did that meal hit the spot or what?  Service was courteous and friendly, but you may have to get your own napkins and water. If you're afraid of language barriers, it turns out some of them speak English, so no fear! My mom and I speak a lesser known dialect, but we managed with the Mandarin we knew. Also, you're probably better off bringing cash to pay the bill, but most Asian establishments are like that.  Definitely want to try their other offerings, especially their breakfast items and noodle soups.",

We ordered their soya bean juice (served hot in a big bowl) unsweetened, got some Chinese doughnuts for dunking, different Taiwanese pastries and steamed rice dumplings.  It was an interesting breakfast.  Wait staff needs to learn how to speak English.  It was a little difficult talking to the wait staff.    It was just an OK breakfast.",

One would think deep-fried Chinese donuts would be good, right? But nope, they may be fried in old oil. Here, they have fresh oil! The deep-fried donuts are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Next time I am in Vegas, I will most def swing by for breakfast.   Plus, for 2 people, my bill came out to be less than $12.",

My mother-in-law is from Taiwan and this is her favorite restaurant when she comes into town.   The spicy beef noodle soup is a must have when you come here! The portions are large so I usually share with my wife. Everything is made fresh to order, and they have a huge selections of dishes.   Some of our other favorites include: spicy wanton soup fried onion pancake turnip cake with a fried egg on top (Luo Buo Gao) Pork and mushroom steamed buns Curry meat pies Sun cakes Soy bean milk (made fresh daily) rice roll (fan tuan) twisted cruller (you tiao) Baked wheat cake (shao bing) Fried pot stickers And several more that I can't remember right now  A MUST TRY FOR ANY ASIAN FOOD LOVER!!!",

They don't skimp on the pork floss and the rice was just the right texture, not too hard, but solid enough to maintain structural integrity and offering the perfect level of chewiness. The fan tuan here was WAY better than the one from their LA store.  I also had the beef shao bing (sandwich-like thing). I was caught off guard that it came cold. I mean, I get that it's prepared but couldn't they at least serve it lukewarm? or room temp? I couldn't eat it cold so I had the waitress reheat it for me.   After the reheating, it was pretty good, but but blow-my-mind spectacular. The dough was crispy and the beef was okay.   The douhua (soy...jelly?) was very refreshing. I love that it was not too sweet and you can add sugar to your liking.  Get the fan tuan.",

    "text": "I love their spicy beef and tendon noodle soup. It comes in this bowl that looks small in circumference but is deep, so it's a lot of food. The noodles are cooked just right, beef could be a bit softer, but there's very little fat in it, and the broth is hot and spicy. There's only a few places I go in town to get my beef noodle fix, and this is on the top of my list. If you don't speak Mandarin or look Chinese, I find that they tend to make the soup less spicy because they don't think you can handle it, so ask the waitress to make the soup super spicy.  They have a wide variety of Taiwanese dishes, ranging from breakfast to lunch items. I haven't tried their breakfast, so I can't comment on it. But they do have the typical Taiwanese appetizers and dishes, such as pig's ear, oyster pancake, and pork chop rice. The only dish I'm not a fan of is the noodles with the spicy peanut sauce, only because it tastes like peanut butter and chili garlic sauce mixed together.   Service is on the lackluster side, they like to assume that if you look Chinese, you must be able to speak Mandarin and nothing else (like Cantonese). If you want water, you have to go to the water dispenser to get some. There's usually only one waitress working, so if you don't want to wait to pay for your bill, it's better to just go up to the register and do it. Also, there's a minimum $10 order if you're using a debit or credit card.   Overall, Yi Mei has some great Taiwanese food but their service could use some improvement.",

The flavors were good; albeit a little oily and salty for us. Soup dumplings were almost on point but had no soup inside. We will definitely come back here when we're back in Vegas.",

The first 2 were just average, but the fried pork and rice dish was fantastic! Big enough to feed 2 people, the pork was flavorful, moist, and crisp, came with kimchi, preserved mustard greens, bok choi, and minced pork over white rice. Best fried pork chop ever. Will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas. I found the service to be fine. They're Taiwanese and don't greet you when you enter, which is fine 'cause I'm typically a grouch in the morning. I just asked a server if we could sit anywhere and got an affirmative. Menus are already on the tables and they're efficient in taking your order and bringing hot food. Pay at the counter. What else do you want from a mom and pop? We weren't charged tip automatically for our party of 3 - could be 'cause we paid cash and didn't really expect that much service. They're busy enough as it is without 4+ stars on yelp, so hopefully y'all will continue to rate it poorly so that it's easy to get a seat when I visit in future.",

It was OK and it does smell like an old sock.  Next \"Spicy\" Beef Noodle, I put the quotes because it was not spicy at all.  Noodles had a nice chew to it, nice beefy flavor from the soup,  big chunks of beef and tendon.  Overall it was a nice dish but wanted it SPICY.  Lastly we had the Shiao Long Bao.  First time eating it so have no reference point.  It's OK, wish the dipping sauce had a little more vinegar to it.  Not sure if our next Vegas trip we'll go here again.  If we did I'd definitely order the duck tongue again and probably try other item.",

I remember clearly she stated that \"This IS the thing to order at Yi Mei,\" and at last I'm a believer!  For $6.99 you get a hearty bowl of noodle soup with a kick.  Modest plumped egg noodles perched high above the broth like a volcano with diced mustard leaf and sliced baby bok choy acting the role as lava.  Only, those greens aren't just for textures.  Scallions and cilantro are thrown into the fire as well. The soup itself has a really nice tang in there for a spicy broth not to mentions there's plenty of tender loving' beef chunks swimming around in your oasis. Perfect therapy food for the unwell.  Make sure you grab yourself a Chrysanthemum Tea while you wait for your remedy.    I tried their XLB  (Shanghai Dumplings) and didn't really enjoy them as much i wanted to.  They were mini size dumplings, so there wasn't much juice in them.  And because of their size you'd know they're made in-house.  The soy dipping sauce that came with it was mild in sweet with shredded ginger slice.  I add vinegar, chili paste, and soy for personal preference which prob made it worse.  15min wait for these.    Green Scallion Pancakes were also tested since my Taiwanese food's archives is limit close to nothing.   They were a bit bland since it was thick and way doughier than what I'm use to.  Sadly, I couldn't take more than a few bite of this.   Sorry, no pics. I've been here three times this week and each time I castled myself away from everything that's bind to me with that first sip.  Luckily for me an order of the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup is not super, ginormous since i magically tend to slip off layers of clothing during my treatment.  So might i suggest taking off your jacket before digging in?  If you're confused about which store it is, it's the store 2-3 doors down from 168 Market with only Chinese characters surrounding \"Taiwan Deli.\"  Upon entering you can order either at counter or grab a seat and wait for service.  Either way the attention you receive will have curative qualities.",

    "text": "We were fans of the Champion Gourmet on Spring Mountain and very sad when they closed down.  However, the Yangs (Bobby and Misti) were the first to tell us that they were reopening business in this shopping center and we anxiously awaited their grand opening.    What we loved most was their hot pot option - something that currently is not offered.  (Word from Auntie Bo directly said she'll be starting the hot pot business again come the new year! Yay!)  We even missed out on the famous CMYE: Breakfast of Champions event, which got raving reviews and reinforced how fabulous the Taiwanese breakfast experience was there.  (We plan on hitting it up one of these days!)  One day the Husband came home and said he wanted some Spicy Beef Noodle Soup from Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli. Apparently someone from work had been raving about it, and yelpers concurred!  So off we went to dinner!  This is what we tried:     * Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.99) - This is THE thing to order at Yi Mei.  Look around and you'll see every table have a bowl of this.  Every review talks about it and I can see why.  The Husband liked it and found the beef to be tender.  I was personally enjoying the noodle part more.  It had a good texture, something that Suki L. talks extensively about it in her review.  It also came with bok chopy and pickles, be sure to ask for more of those preserved pickles because they add a nice contrast to the dish.  Bring me a bowl of the noodles, broth, bok choy, and pickles and I'm good to go!   * Special Fry Tofu ($4.99) - This was a long shot because we weren't sure exactly what was going to make this a 'special' fried tofu.  While we waited for this dish to arrive, the Husband asked if they had the stinky tofu still.  I wasn't sure since there was another dish on the menu called \"Hot Spicy Special Tofu\" and thought that may be the dish!  When it did come, it looked like before with pickled cabbage and a dipping sauce.  When I bit into it, it was definitely the stinky tofu.  The texture was a bit dried out, but the crispiness of the tofu was refreshing.  * Green Onion Pancake ($2.99) - One pancake arrived and it was a bit thicker than what I'm used to getting. We needed to add some hot chili oil (and other condiments found on the table) to give it a little more of a kick.  I personally prefer thinner green onion pancakes.  * Steamed Bao ($4.99) - Also known as Shanghai dumplings or  Xiao Lung Baos.  They were the last to arrive.  There were eight small dumplings that were a little gummy and could have used a bit more time in the steamer.  I prefer it that way so the hot soup within the dumpling can burn my tongue a bit.  This is a pretty casual restaurant where there is a self service station for hot tea, water, and utensils.  You'll find this on your immediate right when you walk in.  Take a seat and be sure they know you sat down so you'll get menus.  (Try to ignore the spelling errors on the menu.) And when you're ready to pay, head to the register and know what number table you sat on to help them out.  This place is steadily busy, and not just from new customers who happen to be shopping at the nearby 168 Market.  But rather, these are long-time customers from their old restaurant.  You can tell they have a strong following.  When the Husband was paying, he got a chance to meet and talk with Auntie Bo, who is just the friendliest lady.  That's when we heard that hot pot was returning come the new year and we were psyched!  You can't help but love the family-oriented atmosphere where regulars come to enjoy some quality homelike food.  She really makes an effort to know her customers!     Not only is Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli a restaurant, but it's a mini market as well. You'll find dried goods and refrigerated items for sale.  Take a look around for some interesting and unique goods!  Update! 01.06.11 - I stopped by and asked Auntie Bo about the return of the hot pot. Looks like it's not going to happen anymore. =(  She said they just don't have the staff to do it.  Oh well.  But she did mention Dragon House as an option for hot pot which I can confirm!",

    "text": "I wasn't super impressed with this place.   Based on reviews and word of mouth, I was excited to try given the lack of good Taiwanese food in town. I got my group together and we headed over.  Well, I was pretty disappointed by the selection of menu items and found it hard to read. I'm used to misspellings, grammar error and non-translated verbiage... but this was ridiculous. My whole party had a tough time navigating our way through the menu, even my friend who knows Taiwanese.   When we finally decided what we wanted and ordered, we were excited about our meals coming out. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. I did enjoy some of the food we had ordered, but a majority of it was bland. I didn't feel the need to lick my plate and that makes me sad. I needed more spice or flavor to almost everything I ordered and the textures were a little off as well.  I left feeling hungry and unfulfilled, as did the rest of my party.",

I was also on the phone so I didn't witness much in the beginning.  I've grown up with oil sticks so this was a pretty awesome place for me to go to. Usually I'd eat oil sticks and fried taro and the like in China or New York or something.  We ordered a breakfast meal pretty much. It was just veggie-pork bun and oil sticks and this sweet soupy stuff. I totally forgot the name. If you look at the menu, everything looks cheap. It's about $1-4 range (the menu on the wall). I'm probably going to come here a lot with friends now and get random stuff here and there. It's as close as I've been to to the food that I grew up eating for breakfast.  I'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "We ( My date and I ) checked out this newly opened Taiwanese Deli place that's next to Lelysee Bakery and near 168 Market.  Reminds me of Tea Planet without the booth seats and colorful interior. They have some snacks and health products for sale that you can browse through if you like..  They have a self serve utensils and water dispenser if you need an extra bowl or cup to share food or just to drink plain water.  We ordered the Chrysanthemum Tea, which was delightfully refreshing to taste. I could drink 10 of these if there were refills.. but that's just wishful thinking. This is my all time summer drink to cool my body when I feel like I'm about to experience heat exhaustion... it works instantly and you literally feel relieved.. even to say... Aaaaaaaaaaah!!  For dinner, we ordered two most popular Taiwanese dishes:  Spicy Beef Noodle (Soup) - Surprised it wasn't overpowering with the spices that I thought it would have. It was actually just right in giving it a kick each time you took a sip. I actually really enjoyed this broth. I loved the noodles! It had a great texture as if it was homemade. Thicker than fettuccine noodles, but thinner width-wise. It was like udon noodles texture, but half its size... absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beef was like stew meat that is cooked for many hours... unfortunately I had to minus a star for the fact that some of the chunks of meat ( the ends/corners of it ) were quite tough to chew upon. And for that reason, I couldn't even eat the remainder of the beef chunks, but I did finish all the noodles, sliced green cabbage, and some kind of pickled shredded mustard green.  Rice with Pork Chop - It also came with a boiled egg, steam greens, and ground pork. The coating is somewhat similar to katsu style, but this batter they dip the pork chop into and deep fry is on point! It had a light, airy crispy crunch on the outside.. which was my favorite!!! * My eyes lit up like Christmas lights in full blast from biting into a piece. Very tasty and satisfied all my taste buds. Even the meat was tender and juicy.  Bravo!! Bravooooo!!! I definitely recommend this dish if you love meat and deep fried food. It really hits the spot indefinitely :)  They also open at 7a.m.- 11:30a.m. for breakfast, which I heard was incredibly cheap, but good. Service was quick, but not much smiles... At least my tummy was smiling and it put me in a great mood. Hey I'm an emotional eater... What? *Ladeedadee skipping away.....",

    "text": "Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli has finally opened just a few doors down from 168 Supermarket. And on its first day being opened to the public, it has already attracted a very nice crowd of eager patrons.  From the hand written signs near the cashiers counter, it states that it is open everyday except Thursday. This little restaurant with seating capacity of 48 has a Breakfast Menu which is served from 7am to 11:30am, and a Lunch Menu served from 11:30am to 9pm. Since I was coming from work, by the time I had arrived it was already 11:36am and most of their breakfast items were sold out. Meaning no freshly made soy milk (or Iced Soy/Bean Juice as it is called in their menu) for me, which was the primary objective of this visit and the reason for skipping the free lunch at work. So I ordered the Beef Roll with Preserved Vegetable (it was that or the version made with pork), which was pretty much the only item available from the Breakfast Menu. And it was quickly served to me on a red china and still wrapped in the plastic wrap.  It is a sesame crusted thin bread stuffed with slices of braised beef with Chinese preserved vegetable.  It was alright. A little on the dry side, but a good experience to try their version thousands of miles away from the original in Taiwan and China.  As I ate and looking over their menu I see that they also serve various handmade dumplings (such as \"Steam Bao\" aka Xiao Long Bao, which was also sold out), Spicy Beef Noodle (which I ordered), various Taiwanese Deli, Shaved Ice (which they don't currently serve), cold beverages and hot desserts. The back of their business cards also states in Chinese that they served Taiwanese style hot pots, but that is not in their menu, just like the breakfastitems are not listed in the menu. I also ordered \"Temple Meatball\" and Fish-Ball Soup (should be more accurately called Fuzhou fish ball).  The first item I ordered arrived quickly, since it was premade and came on a plate still wrapped in plastic wrap.  It was okay, maybe too dried and lack much flavor to warrant trying again in the future.  After that it took pretty long for the items to be sent out the kitchen, since I doubt they were expecting this kind of crowd on opening day and they probably don't have any proper line cooks working in the back.  So by the time I finished everything and paid by bill it is 12:50pm already.  The kitchen is definitely not ready for the better than expected turnout, but hopefully with more practice they will soon get the hang of it.  As of right now, there is no POS in use, so items that are out, must be communicated to the staff taking the orders as it comes in, and if not everyone is on the same page, you end up with customers waiting for a good long time, until they either ask about the status of their order or just gives up and pay for what they have already been served. Furthermore, the kitchen and the expeditor needs to agree on how orders are placed and executed, because the time for discussing how to handle order tickets is not in the middle of service.  Food-wise, I thought it was just okay.  The best item I tried was the Spicy Beef Noodle, except I felt the beef needed to be braised longer, since not all of them were tender. There are also still a lot of things I want to try if they are actually available, so I will be back.  Menu - sadly very typical of the mom and pop operations in that the English translations of menu items are 1) misspelled, 2) poorly translated, 3) utilises questionable word choice.  If the restaurant needs someone to correct their menu, I can do it. I just hate seeing simple words like tofu, noodle, chicken spelled correctly in one part of the menu and not in others. And I also can't understand why some parts of the menu is not translated at all, like the shaved ice. It is not that hard to translate select any 3 toppings, 4 toppings, etc for X price. Parking - pretty convenient since it is in the same plaza as 168 Market.  Price - pretty reasonable for most items.  3 stars.  They also have shaved ice on the menu, but it is not available yet.",

    "text": "So much has changed since I moved away from Vegas 2.5 years ago.  I went to Yi Mei's old location and was disappointed that they had closed, but then realized after checking Yelp that they had moved.  The new location is easily 3-4x the size of their prior location.  The food is still as solid and as authentically Taiwanese as ever.  We came for breakfast and started off with hot soy milk.  Remember, if you ask for sweet soy milk, it comes hot by default and is actually unsweetened since they expect you to sweeten it to your taste.  This is done at every Taiwanese breakfast place because sweetened soy milk being kept warm would start to burn.  The soy milk had a nice taste to it and the perfect accompaniment for what was to come.  Next came the egg pancake.  It was as good as my mom and relatives used to make.  The egg was perhaps just a tad bit oversalted, but it tasted great overall.  The tortilla component was nice and soft and chewy.  I also had a sweet rice roll, which was exactly what I expected.  They got the ratio of peanuts to cruller correct so it tasted great.  Finally, we got the \"Chinese sandwich\" and \"Chinese donut\".  Traditionally, you put the donut part inside the sandwich and then dip it into hot soy milk.  I was really impressed by the sandwich component.  It was really flaky and the sesame seeds on top added a nice flavor.  Overall, solid place for Taiwanese breakfast.  My Taiwanese parents approved.",

If you get the sweet option, you can put as much sugar at your own risk. Taiwanese breakfast restaurants are probably the only ones I've ever seen with huge containers of sugar. Double check you aren't pouring in tons of salt by accident! I like the flavor of the salty soy milk and it even has some pieces of fried dough! Makes me feel like I'm not getting diabetes. I think the Beijing style egg pancakes have a bunch of weird things in them Just need a crepe style dough, scrambled eggs, scallions, and chili sauce on the side. The fried dough and the ( it's like a flatbread with sesame that you wrap around the fried dough) is not oily. Some of my family members thought they could be crispier, but then they would probably have to use fresh oil to fry them.",

But I must say this one is definitely better due to the amount of space they have to seat their guest and it is a lot more organized.   My favorite here is their soup dumplings. I usually order about 2-3 orders cause they are so DELICIOUS!! I also like their turnip cake with egg on top of it. It's great but not as good as LA due to the turnip cake being a little too think. But overall it was good.   I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the Las Vegas area and are looking for a good place to have some Asian breakfast!",

We dropped by for lunch on an early Saturday afternoon. It got a little busy right after we arrived which might've contributed to the strange time we experienced there.  We ordered a few dishes to start with. We wanted some other things as well, but no one came back to take our additional orders. I tried to get someone's attention, but they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Our dishes were delivered by a male server who would drop the dish off, mention what it is and then immediately run off. Wrong dishes were delivered to our table a couple of times.  Their menu is very difficult to follow if you don't already know what you want. The pictures on Yelp are very useful for figuring out what some of the dishes are.  If you don't mind not knowing what you are ordering and if you don't mind servers that have no time to talk to you about anything, then you might have an okay time here. Otherwise, the dining experience is so confusing we won't be going back.",

    "text": "We left Vegas early to head to Death Valley... and started the morning off with a Taiwanese breakfast! Found Yi Mei on Yelp and when we got there at 10:30, it was packed!  I did both breakfast and lunch items together - started off with a fan tuan (rice roll? I don't know the direct english translation) and moved on to my pai gu fan (pork + rice), which was huge. We also tried the Oyster Pancake, average... could of been better, and the green onion pancake (cong you bing), just okay. The beef noodle soups were pretty oily, so avoid those if your stomach can't handle grease.  Super nice owner, actually from the bay area, and because we bought a bunch of snacks and soymilk to bring on the trip, she gave us extra things for free like a box of pineapple cakes, some sort of coffee drinks, etc. We came back a few days later and she still remembered us. Good service!  It's a good break (and reasonable priced meal) from Vegas - about a 5 minute drive west of the strip --  PHOTOS: Onion Pancake: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA?select=NFgBLqbwVGuhK1c6r-JJ4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Jjjl...</a> Pork + Rice: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA?select=4cCWMXo7niJ7GsAHJ1j_1Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Jjjl...</a> Oyster Pancake: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA?select=qd0mVfjzXkYv-elKVAMivQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Jjjl...</a> Fan Tuan: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JjjlhlQ2LEaQMuAug4fDIA?select=JvFuD25JawX6Jp9yQbODqQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Jjjl...</a>",

When I asked for water the first time, the waiter just rudely said \"Wait!\" without saying anything else. I waited like ten minutes, the server came by to give the other table boxes, I asked for water again. He just said, \"It's too busy! Wait!!\". Is that rude?!!! I asked twice with respect and smile, he just frowned and answered very impatiently replied to me. Finally, I have to go get boxes myself and checked out at the counter. The restaurant didn't even have half capacity by that time. I have no idea what the server is busying about!! The server saw me at the counter and didn't even say anything, of course didn't say sorry. I felt so sorry for my parents not getting good experience. Definitely not a recommended place for those people who wants to have at lease respected experience.",

They don't speak/understand English that well, so don't get disappointed.  They prefer you to let them know when you're ready to order.    I'm tossed between the Noodle Pot restaurant & this place for the spicy beef stew.  The flavorings are really different.  One feels like its has more flavor (Noodle pot) but I get so thirsty afterwards.  This Yi Mei feels like it can add a little bit more seasoning but the portion size & noodles are more than the Noodle pot.  Btw, Noodle Pot only takes CASH but Yi Mei accepts credit cards.  They're both Good but I wish they taste more like Monterey Park.  I switch off between them depending which one is the closes at that moment.",

    "text": "This place is a hit or miss with the service but the food is always good. Tried to eat here last night at 8pm. It says they close at 9pm. We got there and all their tables were full of to go boxes for catering or something. It was so awkward. We asked if they were still open for service and the lady was like \"to go?\" We had said no and left coz she didn't say anything else. Anyway, I've come here a few times during breakfast hours. It's always full. They don't really speak English. I usually come with my Chinese friend and she speaks their language so it's not too hard to communicate. I did come one time with my husband and his family and a very nice girl helped us even tho she didn't speak English. so if you get passed that, the food is pretty good. I like the salted rice roll and their minced meat noodles. If you get there early enough they might still have the salted bean curd with peanuts. We've gone twice around 10am and they were out. They're always busy during breakfast hours so don't expect 5 star service, last time we just sat at a dirty table for about 20 mins before they cleared it out lol but like I said the food is good if you can get passed the service. Maybe ill try coming for lunch just to have my noodles.",

You don't have the noodle soup for breakfast? Lady: No! No noodle until 9:00. Breakfast only!  Husband: Okaaaay...then can we get the breakfast special?  Lady: No! No breakfast special!

    "text": "Owner/chef Borman Yung is a charming, incandescent, talented cook and businesswoman.  I met her a few weeks ago when I popped my head in to see what Yi Mei was all about...she immediately began to ply me with deliciousness (but truth be told, I'd just had a huge lunch at China Mama) so I promised her I'd return.  So when I was invited to lunch today by two of my favorite students and adventurous eaters, I knew they'd love exploring Yi Mei with me...and we had a blast.  First, I reviewed what previous reviewers have said on yelp - cross referencing it with the menu she gave me and John Curtas' thoughts...then I dug in and made a list of the dishes that I knew we should try on our first pass -- and it was an amazing first visit...  Spicy Beef Noodle soup was terrific...well balanced delicious - not that spicy...but really good... and the noodles...oy.  Scallion Pancake...textbook  Beef roll...honestly this was my least favorite - but the pickled cucumber and and the kimchee with it were so good, I didn't care.  Sticky Rice Roll with shredded pork...think sweet, fuzzy, crispy, umami chewiness...awesome.  totally the first time I've ever had anything like this before and I loved it.    Sesame Sauced Wide Noodles that were divine...rich, garlicky, warm, with scallions.  again - the noodles were perfectly cooked - so wonderful.    XLB that were perfectly sized...finally, I didn't feel like I was going to choke because I had too much in my mouth - these were heavenly. The broth inside wasn't scalding - but I've had them enough now to know how to eat them - with great respect...  Potstickers - no, not redundant, completely different in technique - and with the addition of leeks to the minced pork, these, too, were just perfect.  Two of us ordered chrysanthemum teas - another ordered winter melon juice which was like drinking raisin-honey water...completely surprising and delicious.  So, as table after table of Chinese left, giving us thumbs up, we realized we'd clearly ordered and eaten impressively...We just couldn't stop....  That's when we met Borman...I kept looking for the darling woman I'd met the first time - but she wasn't there... (because she was cooking...)  She came out to see how we liked everything - and I smiled... she said her 80 year old mother had taken the day off... so she was in the kitchen.  We raved to her - so with that she picked out her two favorite desserts and cups of freshly squeezed soy milk and presented them to us, on her.   I didn't think I could eat another bite - but naturally, we soldiered on through what I thought would be sickeningly sweet...I was wrong... everything was subtle, interesting, unlike anything I'd had before - although somewhat recognizable.  From the sun cookie with the chinese symbol on top. to the sweet fried bread, to creamy, but refreshingly wonderful...I was hooked.  She told us about her breakfast.    We talked about her children - which is why she came to America - for their education...one's a doctor in Ohio, the other also a doctor with an MBA... She left behind a producing career in radio in Taiwan to support them here...and hasn't looked back... Single now, she's funny and contagiously happy, a wonderful story teller and completely passionate about doing things right.    I never knew how soy milk was made - she gave us a detailed lesson - and probably would have given us a demo, had we asked...I'll have to remember to do that next time.    As we left, she asked me how many folks I worked with, and sent me back to the office with three boxes of pineapple cakes for them - and plenty of menus - and an offer to do anything to help whenever I might need it... : )   She also mentioned proudly her Yelp event...and how much she adores Misti and her husband...how she met them, and raved about his musical talent and regaled us with stories of them and Kevin Costner... ask her!     This is one of the reasons I've really grown to love Las Vegas - the possibility of finding special treasures like this - Yi Mei and Borman - one and the same - inextricably intertwined, families doing what they love - and loving us in the process...  Go, eat.    Open 7 days, 7am - 9pm.",

I found Yi Mei Champion and I have been making them a routine stop for breakfast in my Vegas visits. Service is terrible but their food is great. Their turn around time from ordering can be better. I think they are just short staffed.  I recommend getting their salty rice rolls. A staple in Taiwanese street food, it's a roll of rice with fried air bread, shredded pork and pickled cabbage inside. It's cheap, tasty and filling. Their soy milk is also really good here. I didn't think much of their scallion pancakes or dumplings. They were average. Overall, their breakfast items are lighter than American breakfast and much cheaper.",

Variety 4.5* nice menu selection Food taste 3* the dishes we tried tasted ok, not outstanding.  Providing a relief from Americana style breakfasts in Vegas, this small homey restaurant offers dishes unique to the usual strip fare.   The Chinese fried dough crullers were nice and crunchy, not too oily. The porridge was well made and standard. The green onion pancakes were a bit thick but pretty crunchy and not too oily. The soup dumplings, which was what brought us here, however, were disappointing; there wasn't enough soup, the dumpling skin was somewhat brittle and uneven. The pork filling lacked seasoning though the texture was good.   Though this place falls short of food you would get in coastal metropolitan chinatowns, it's a great food option if you're looking for a different meal at low prices, but beware, you may get sick eating here.",

Their fish fillet is a disaster as it's just like they got precooked breaded fish fillets from Walmart then deep fried them to serve you. Bland, dried, tasteless... Service is not so good. We are the only 2nd table in the restaurant and the lady brought us food then disappeared without even bringing any water. We have to ask when we saw her after finishing more than half of our meal.  They turn on the TV so loud with either Chinese news or some kind of Chinese drama.  The ambience is not good as there are plenty of empty carton boxes in the corner, stacks of drinks/water bottles in the middle of the room.   Definitely not return.",

Your classic Chinese donut and baked sandwich was definitely not made this morning. It was chewy, like in a stale way. The soy bean drink has a burnt and gritty taste, which some people may like but I totally didn't. The egg pancake was over cooked, i could make a better one myself at home with frozen pancake you buy at the store and add an egg. The stuffed rice roll was the only edible thing out of the 6 items we ordered.  Definitely, never coming back again.",

    "text": "My friend highly recommended this Taiwanese breakfast spot in Vegas when I told him I was going, so the 4 of us decided to order delivery via DoorDash on a recent trip to Vegas.  We may have gone a little bit too crazy on the ordering, with a whopping 13 items in the cart for just for 4 people. We probably ordered enough for at least 7 people, but that just meant we had plenty of leftovers for the next day!  I didn't eat all of this, but here is what we ordered. Prices are very reasonable too; nothing was over $5.  1. Sweet Soybean Milk with Peanuts ($2.25) 5. Salted Bean Curd with Peanuts ($3.99) 7. Chinese Donut ($2.25) 8. Egg Cake with Chinese Donut ($4.99) 14. Salted Rice Roll ($3.50) 15. Yi Mei Rice Roll with Mustard Green ($3.95) 16. Champion Rice Roll with Spicy Pickled Vegetable ($4.75) 17. Egg Pancake ($3.99) 20. Green Onion Pancake with Egg ($4.99) 22. Radish Pancake with Egg ($4.99) 24. Taiwan Style Meat Ball ($4.99)  My favorites were the egg pancake and the radish pancake with egg. The egg pancake was extremely soft, and the radish pancake had a lot of flavor. Both were a tiny bit on the bland side, but the radish pancake came with a delicious soy sauce/ginger sauce that we dipped everything in.  One member of our group was vegetarian, so I appreciated that the radish pancake didn't seem to have any dried sausage in it like it normally does. The one thing I would change is that I would order some items with eggs but not everything. We were pretty egg'd out by the end of the meal.  I didn't eat any of the salted rice rolls since they all came with dried pork floss inside and I'm not a fan of that, but that was a hit with my other friends.",

So I tried their sweet soybean milk, their radish pancake, egg pancake, Chinese donut, corn porridge, pork chop rice and spicy tendon noodle. Their sweet soybean milk really stands out as the pulp from the soybeans create an interesting but fresh aftertaste. Also their radish pancake taste better than a regular radish pancake at a dim sum place because it's fried better with more flavor. The egg pancake wasn't as good as advertised, when I got it it was cold. The Chinese donut was comparable to any other Dim sum place. The corn porridge was tasteless (I don't know if that's what it supposed to taste like). The pork chop rice plate had plenty of quantity and variety but taste wise not as good as some of the Vietnamese rice plates. And for the spicy beef tendon noodle soup, I don't think 3 tendons is enough. Overall, I would come back for quick grab or as an alternative to dim sum. But their quality can be improved.",

    "text": "Confession: I have actually never had full on Taiwanese breakfast before. I'm Cantonese, used to dim sum. So when I came to Yi Mei, I was thoroughly impressed by the breakfast options, even if it's a lot of carb on carb action.  They have a vast menu and serve most of the items there pretty early in the day. Portions are also plentiful.  Here's everything in order of what we liked: 1. Chinese Donut Egg cake - basically its an omelet stuffed with the chinese donut. Crisp and crunchy, juxtaposed by egg. Good way to start the day. 2. Simmered beef flank, tendon and tofu - its cold cuts basically with a chili sauce. I think I particularly liked it because it had some deeper flavors that countered all the carbs we ordered, but its cool, crunchy, chewy and tender depending on what you pick up with the chopsticks. Good to take in between bites. 3. Beef roll - think of the beef above rolled in a pancake. Also comes with smashed cucumbers and kimchi, which is also appreciated for its refreshing palate cleansing power. 3. Fresh soymilk - good for dipping the chinese donut but also it is just sweet enough with a decent bit of grit. 4. Green Onion Pancake (w/egg) - we got both with and without egg, but with egg is better. It's a bit dense, not as layered as I would like my green onion pancake to be, but with the egg, the texture contrast again helps. 5. Tea eggs - they're good, but not particularly strong flavored. Nice patterning though on the egg. 6. Steamed vegetable buns - fluffy and chock full of filling  All in all, if you want a good breakfast and just eating by yourself, I would recommend the soy milk with just the chinese donut (with or without the egg). They fry it well and it works with everything!",

Unfortunately the food is delicious so can be worth the hassle if you and your Asian parents aren't in a rush and are craving Taiwanese food. We got all breakfast food and it came quickly after we ordered. Not the best I've had but very good. The radish pancake was surprisingly good. The baked beef sandwich had good beef but was dry. Dipping it into the salted soybean milk helped. The temple meatball skin was thin but solid flavor.   They include tip on the bill so that doesn't really incentivize good service.",

First off, you know you \"made\" it to the right delicious place when most of the workers there don't speak much English, service is a little subpar, but the food is goshdarn delicious.  We ordered the salty rice roll, which is pretty delicious even though it's such a very simple dish. But hey- sometimes the simpler the better! Their soup dumplings are also pretty delicious, but the wrapping is somewhat a bit too thin so some of the dumplings leaked the delicious juice right as you picked it up from the tin.  Our favorite dish was the daikon with egg. So delicious! I highly recommend this one, and it's great for sharing too.   Overall, the food here is really good. Don't expect 5 star service, but your tummy will be happy. Credit cards accepted, plenty of parking.",

    "text": "I wish there were more places offering Chinese breakfast here in Vegas. Not dim sum type breakfast, but the street vendor type that just tastes so comforting. Taiwanese breakfast doesn't quite satisfy this craving but it does hold its own merits of buns, pancakes, and rice rolls galore. I brought my grandparents here for breakfast and we ordered a variety of items to share  The egg pancake was recommended to us as a savory selection for my diabetic gramps and it was our favorite. Just a soft fluffy omelette cooked onto a thin pancake. So simple and delicious. The you tiao was crisp and the soy milk was hot and fresh. Pro tip- dip a piece in the soy milk just like you'd dunk an Oreo. Can't go wrong with that classic combo, it's a match made in heaven!  Everything else was good. Maybe not great, but still good. Tastes just about the same as it did years ago at their old location next to 168 Market. Cheap prices for a ton of food that's all served up real fast. I love how the owner helped package our leftovers individually in baggies. Not only does it help the environment as less boxes are used, it also prevents food from touching and provides easy utensil free eating",

    "text": "Visiting a friend in Henderson and wanted to try a local Taiwanese joint.    The good:  The warm Sesame Noodles were amazing!  This used to be one of my favorite dishes in Taiwan, and very rarely have I found a place that will give you a bowl with a heaping of sesame paste/sauce.  Usually it is a very tiny spoonful, or at least that's how it is in LA.  The noodles were warm, soft and chewy, and the cucumbers added some texture to it.  For me, it is worth coming back.  The waitress says they make their own sesame paste.  I have ordered it at restaurants in LA before, and it was literally just a package they bought from the local 99 ranch grocery store.  Tip:  throw in some of the chili oil and soy sauce to increase the flavor.    Also, the green onion pancake with egg was great!  I was eating with a friend that doesn't usually eat Taiwanese food, and this was his favorite thing.  Warm, crunchy, salty, and savory; it's a great  snack, but I can't verify if it is homemade.  Honestly, green onion pancake is pretty difficult to mess up, and i have rarely had a bad one.  The bad:  The corn porridge.  I can't verify how authentic it is, but whatever it is, I won't be ordering it again.  Pretty much just water and like cornmeal.  Super thin, and without any flavor at all.  Put in some sauces to add flavor, still didn't really like it.  Save your money.    The OK:  The salty fan tuan.  I can't remember what it translated to in English, but it is like a burrito with the outside layer being made of hardened rice.  Inside, there is a long chinese donut (you tiao) and meat floss.  That is just ok and very standard for the places I have ordered from before.  No place in the US comes close to fan tuan in china with crispy pork, crispy chinese donut in the center and pickled vegetables inside.  The search continues to find a good one.    Final Verdict:  I would return for the noodles and green onion pancake, would avoid the others and possibly try some new things.",

Soup dumplings, take a few minutes to prepare,  they were very good.  We ordered a beef noodle soup, a shrimp omelet (had a gravy on top with a hint of cinnamon?), pork/chives dumplings (nothing special and tasted like any frozen dumpling from an asian grocery store), beef pancake wrap, and tea eggs.   They serve breakfast and open at 7 am.  We landed in Vegas, and went for a late lunch on a Saturday before we headed to Zion NP.  It wasnt crowded and we were seated quickly.  I can see this place being very crowded during peak wknd lunch hrs.   They have a takeout area too.  Underwhelming experience.  But willing to try again with a Taiwanese friend.",

When we got seated we waited for about 20 minutes before the waiter got to us. When we ordered food, the waiter cut us off and went to the kitchen. Me and my friends were not finished yet. People got their food before us and my friends got their Waters before I did. Later our food came. It was DELICIOUS but we still had to order the rest of the order that we didn't get to tell the waiter. 5 minutes later he got to us. The food was great (again). After we were done we paid and tipped them and then were on our way back to our hotel. Personally it was good but the service was just a tiny bit slow. Thank you!",

All their woks and cooking utensils were all being used for them to cook up food for the bus tours. Ridiculous. If we wanted anything outside of the maybe 5 items available it would be a 20 minute wait! Just shitty! We left without paying an extra dime cause thee people sure didn't deserve it! Ten people hustling and bustling and no one gave us an ounce of attention! Shitty Vegas service!! Not exactly cheap either!

    "text": "Giving this restaurant 1 star for the 4 stars that used to be and the negative 3 that is now. This been our favorite whenever we wanted a good bowl of Taiwanese style noodle soup. Something had happened, went there on 6-2-13 for lunch at 11:30am. The place was packed as usual. The waitress twice tried to put 3 of  us at a table that was barely big enough for 2. She was displeased when I refused and told her that we did not mind waiting. I ordered beef noodle soup WITHOUT  green onion (I cannot eat it), of course it came with green onion. After scooped out most of it, found the beef was tough and the broth was salty. Ate less than half of my bowl, my first time of not finishing my food here. As a lover of family run and hole in wall type of restaurants, never set high expectation for great service, but got to be at an acceptable level. This place always has spotty service, but was never this bad. The place was almost empty when we left (12:30pm), very unusual for this place on a Sunday noon. May be other patrons also voted with their feet and went somewhere else. We sure will try out the other Taiwanese restaurant in the same shopping center.",

I only tried a few of the items and thought they were okay but I did enjoy the beef noodle soup. The broth was a little salty but it was very flavorful. This will be my \"go to\" spot for authentic taiwanese beef noodle soup.  PS, since we came here before Chinese New Year, we saw a lot of authentic gifts and pastries to give as gifts to the relatives and to place inside the home for luck and such. They had huge steamed buns, red fish for luck and buns for b-day folks (sau bao). Very interesting sight to see!",

    "text": "Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli is my favorite savory dining experience that I had this past weekend. Well, maybe it tied with Trattoria Nakamura Ya...Anyway, this unassuming spot deserves more than its 3.5 star average.  If you're craving a big breakfast, then Yi Mei Champion Taiwan Deli provides the perfect alternative to eggs, bacon, and pancakes. And it also offers an attractive and arguably superior alternative to dim sum (while I enjoy dim sum, most dim sum restaurants are guilty of making their small plates way too salty, maybe on purpose...).  Just like mentioned in the name, Yi Mei Champion is a Taiwanese deli that provides homey, comforting, perfectly cooked dishes. Honestly, this was the Taiwanese dining experience that I so wanted when I visited in Taipei but didn't get. Casual restaurants are fine by me, actually preferred, but many restaurants that I encountered in the different districts of Taipei seemed to have really questionable sanitation practices, making me nervous to try much. I feel like such a wimp, but that's the truth. Yi Mei is a simple restaurant, but it seemed pretty clean. All our silverware and plates were spotless.  But more importantly, Yi Mei Champion's food is so good. The oyster omelet was on point. It wasn't overly sauced and had lots of oysters. The Chinese donuts for dipping in soups and salty soy bean milk was wonderful--crispy on the outside and hollow on the inside. We tried a few items we'd never had before, like their egg and radish cake. Superlative menu item. It's so delicious, something you must order. We also had something similar to a pork bun or bao, except it was filled with veggies, very flavorful. Their salty soy bean milk is really tasty, too, but it comes with pork floss. Good to know if you don't eat meat. Hubby also sampled pork sticky rice wrapped in a banana leaf, which was another win. Lastly, try their refreshing iced tea from the fridge.  I really love this place. I thought service was polite and prompt, though not chatty. Service was definitely not bad, contrary to what has been described in other reviews. I would highly recommend Yi Mei for an early morning bite, whether a substantial meal or something more akin to a snack. Everything we tried was delicious.",

There is a counter with a menu board but, there is a full menu with table service. After figuring it out, we ordered the beef noodle soup, fried stinky tofu, and squid pottage.   The sticky tofu was good, nice portions and came out hot tasty.  The Squid Pottage was OK, the soup was authentic tasting but the squid was kinda weird in texture.  The beef noodle soup was not very good at all. It lacked the spicy bean paste flavor and was watery salty soy sauce based. The noodles were OK. We didn't mind it being spicy but warning to people who don't like spicy food the regular beef noodle soup is very spicy.  Service was good. Plenty of Parking.",

    "text": "This place may not have overall the highest star rating, but if you read the reviews individually that usually has to do with service and not food.  If I'm in China town, and the place is not pricey, I don't really even consider service unless it's so deplorable they are one step away from spitting at me and insulting my mother.    So ya, I walked in, its not huge, but they did have about 8 tables. The decor is a hodgepodge of crystals, small decorations, items for sale signs etc.  The lady behind the desk didn't speak English, she scurried over to our side after my boyfriend tried to ask her a question, and then pointed at the menu.  She jestured that we point to what we want.  Then we held up the amount of fingers that matched how many of that item.  It's a bit of an issue if you have questions or dietary exceptions.  If you fall in that category flag down the taller man with a ponytail he does speak English.  Luckily I looked at pictures and I knew I wanted the spicy beef noodle soup.  My boyfriend settled on the smoked chicken with egg and rice.  I think it was number 30.  So the beef in my soup is crazy tender, the soup bursting with flavor with just enough kick.  The kind that hits the back of your throat, but nothing crazy.  If you ever had wontons in Chile oil at a Chinese/Taiwanese place that's basically the spice they add to the beef broth.  The noodles had a nice chew to them as well.    I loved my boyfriends chicken! Like it stole my heart.  Also tender like the beef, just perfectly cooked, had this crazy good sauce that was so savory and satisfying with the Smoky chicken, and sopped up with the rice.  The only downside was the egg, it was way over cooked.  However everything else was so delicious I did not even care.    Overall the portions are great, the total cost was about 19 bucks, so totally affordable, and the flavor was big!",

I used to go to deli shop every morning for take out breakfast.  Yi-Mei deli shop does offer very traditional Taiwanese snacks/breakfast. I am only writing in regard of their breakfast. The service was terrible, we were asked by this waiter to sit in one of the tables while waiting for our take out, but when it became busier, the waitress came here and was very rude \"you guys are ordering take out right? This table is for dine in only. You can stand there for waiting.\" Seriously? Never heard of that. Later on, when the order was ready, the lady was yelling in Chinese \"give me your ticket.\" I responded that we never received any receipt. She then proceeded \" no way you don't have a receipt. I give every customer a receipt.\" Yes, we were 100% positive we didn't not receive any receipt or any ticket per se.  It was very embarrassing, my foreign friend felt very uncomfortable and indeed it was very bad presentation for her. As a native Taiwanese, I felt very ashamed.  The food was average. The original Yi mei rice ball was delicious, it has Chinese donut and pork song in it. Very tasty and bring home feeling. Egg pancake was a-ok, very soggy and egg were burnt. Milk tea was very good, tasted like traditional Taiwanese breakfast tea, defiantly different than bubble tea from other places.   The shop needs to work on its service!",

Even when we wanted to pay, she yelled at us to go to the cashier for payment instead of bringing the bill to us. It wasn't about how we pay or we had to go to the cashier, it was her attitude that made us very uncomfortable on January 1st 2018. Yelled at us and everyone in the restaurant looked at us.

I had the traditional Taiwanese style breakfast, Taiwanese pork chop rice, beef noodle soup, Pan fried dumplings, green onion pan cakes, etc. Everything we had was delicious, and the price is reasonable. This place is packed in the morning, so please be a little patient when they are doing their best to be fast. You can come after 9am if you have time, and usually they are not that busy after 9am. You may get a chance to chat with them when they are not busy. :D After all, the food is worth waiting! The owners, waitress and waiters are very friendly. The calligraphy and paintings hanging in the room are very fine, and I like the fish in the thank. They look like my pet fish when I was a kid. I feel like home here.",

The wait staff are very slow and unprofessional, but tolerable in the past because there are so few authentic Chinese breakfast places. Waitress forgetting orders, being rude, making excuses are common.   If you are looking for Chinese breakfast, and do not have a lot of time and/or something to do while waiting, I'd suggest ordering take out instead. They do accept credit cards, min $10 order.",

Not enough oil on the pickled cucumbers though, so thankfully we ordered it on the side. salted rice roll - GET THIS. It's a Chinese donut and shredded pork wrapped with sticky rice. Damn good. I haven't had one of these in ages. My pescetarian friend was able to order a vegetarian version.  pickled cucumbers - spicy and garlicky. worthy of having dragon breath all morning.  STINKY TOFU! nowhere nearly stinky enough, but it will do if you live somewhere where stinky tofu has been basically banned.   Aside from the shit service, I need to come back for beef noodle soup. I wish I ordered an extra salted rice roll to take home in my purse...",

    "text": "When you come to Vegas you expect to be stuck on the strip drinking and eating away but when you come with Asian parents, you end up going back to the Chinatown area for some Chinese food cuz they are sick of the American food. This place is pretty far from the main Chinatown Plaza but if you keep driving down Spring Mountain, you will see a 168 Market and there you will find this Yi Mei. The menu is pretty huge with the selection of taiwanese breakfast items ranging from soy milk to radish cakes. The place is popping in the mornings but can be dead at times as well. I'm happy I found the place though because the meal was super super cheap (in comparison to other Vegas food) and it was delicious. We got the soy milk (unsweetened), rice roll, chinese donut, and chicken roll. The soy milk was good.  According to my parents, it was even better than the ones we get in LA. I liked the rice roll the best because i love sticky rice. It was a great combination of sweet from the rice and savory from the chinese donut and the pork sung. The chinese roll is almost like a sausage. It is pretty oily but it is cut up into pieces so you don't have to eat all of it at once but you probably will. I eat it with the chinese donut almost like a mini hot dog (just remember to try to squeeze out some of the oil from the chinese donut. The service is quick and efficient. The lady that works there seems to know everyone or at least makes it seem like she's your bed bud. There are a ton of other things on the menu. It is kind of like a hole in the wall so remember to clean the table before you start munching. It's quick and simple but satisfying and I have to admit, it's a good break from all of the buffets and benedicts on the strip.  FYI, they also sell vacuum packed items from Champion company which is known for their pork sung and other marinated items.",

I've been craving steamed buns for a few months but haven't been able to find a good place in LV. I wanted plain steamed buns and Yi Mei carries small ones and super big ones at reasonable prices. They also have pork and vegetable ones as well.   My friends and I ordered the beef noodle soup, but the broth was clear. It wasn't what I was expecting... I should have ordered the spicy beef noodle soup instead. I felt the broth was a bit on the bland side.   We also ordered the beef rolls, which were just ok. It was lacking sauce so it was also a bit bland IMO. I probably will be back to order steamed buns to go but will skip on everything else.",

I love how crunchy the Chinese donuts are and how well cooked the glutinous rice is.  It tastes good even when it is cold.  We tried both the Champion and Yi Mei rice rolls.  Both were super good.  We were lucky enough to buy their freshly made mochi. We tried all three flavors and loved all of them.

Then a guy took over the phone and hung up on me. When I called back, he was extremely rude and told me they no longer make stewed eggs. I then requested to speak with the owner and he told me\" this is the same attitude u will get even if u speak with the owner\".

I was so impressed that I was glad to go for lunch a second time during my trip, and it was wonderful - others at the table tried more exotic dishes (including stinky tofu, etc).  All delicious. The owner Borman Yang is so wonderful to speak to, she shares her knowledge about Chinese cooking and I so appreciated speaking to her.

Things to try are their fresh hot soy milk and yao tiao (chinese... donut?). Two chinese staples for breakfast. Other things are like oyster omelettes, fan tuan (taiwanese style rice ball with pork sung - salty), etc.   As said before, not only breakfast, but lunch items as well. my favorite is their spicy beef noodle soup (niao rou mian). though not as spicy as i wanted, but still pretty good. HUGE portion (beware!) so if you are a small eater, may consider sharing with another !",

Gosh, what haven't I had the one time we had 'brunch' here.  We tried the beef noodle soup with beef and tendon.  The flavor is great, a little saltier than I'd like my beef noodle soup....  the noodles seems like home made but a little over cooked but overall it's delicious and reminds me of home.  We got the rice ball with Chinese fried dough and this is a lot bigger than the ones you get in Taiwan.  It's definitely American sized.   We had the salty soy milk, one of my favorite things.  Just like home.  We got the sesame pocket with beef w pickled vegetable or I think they called it the beef roll.... amazing.  Spicy marinated meat with tendon is delicious and just enough spicy.  We also had some milk tea...    Everything is delicious even though the lady might be slightly sassy and snappy....  she also reminds me of home...  :)  I was able to chat up with the owner grandpa, he was super sweet and when he found out I'm also Taiwanese with ancestors from Shandong he was super friendly and the conversation just flowed.   I will for sure come back to this place when I visit Vegas again.  So tasty.",

I really wanted to try Yi Mei because reminds me of food from my childhood.  I knew I couldn't order everything from menu.  I went with juicy pork buns.  One of my favorite of all time.  The juicy pork bun comes 8 per order and needed 15 minutes to cook.  I wasn't in a rush. Yi Mei could have provide water or tea while I waited.  Waitress didn't bring me anything to drink and wasn't her fault since I didn't order a drink.  I have never been a fan of soy milk and seem the poplar drink at this restaurant.  20 minutes and the pork buns were done.  They were delicious with ginger, vinegar, soy sauce on the side.  I had some fancy duck dish for lunch at Mesa.  But it didn't compare pork bun dish at Yi Mei.  That I will remember for rest of my life. Next time 5 stars if Yi Mei brings me some water or tea with food.  I'm willing to pay for water.",

This place is definitely not the same. Although they sell the same menu, the food just taste bad. Turnip cake was a failure, and didn't have the sweet sauce on it either. It took forever and still wasn't worth it. Egg wrap was decent I guess. What is with the soy milk? How come i order sweeten soy milk, and it is basically regular soy milk and you have to add your own sugar? If I have to add my own sugar, I feel like I'm a step closer to diabetes.  The service...Idk. We were told to wait because there were many people, and then people that came in after us got seated before is. Pretty much they forgot to seat us, and when they did, we sat under the construction area where there was probably asbetos falling down. I didn't mind the somewhat poor service as long as it's good food, but the food wasn't good. I don't think I'll come here again. Too disappointed.",
