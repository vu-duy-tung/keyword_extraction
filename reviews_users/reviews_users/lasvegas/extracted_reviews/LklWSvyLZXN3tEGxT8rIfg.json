I paired this with a side of pimento Mac & cheese (they had me with pimento) and collared greens. I washed it all down with some of the best ice tea I have ever had. Miss Hattie knows how to cook!

    "text": "I've always wanted to try Howlin Rays in LA, but the wait is super long and I can't get myself to wait HOURS for chicken. With all the craze and hype around the \"hot/spicy\" fried chicken scene, I was super excited to see Hattie B's inside the Cosmopolitan. During our stay at the Cosmopolitan we dined at Hattie B's twice. The first time we got the 3 piece tenders in the \"hot\" spice level. I love to eat spicy food and I would say their \"hot\" was actually mild for me. We went back the next day and decided to get their hottest spice level in \"shut the cluck up\". As we were going back up to our room to eat, we realized we forgot to grab a drink. Oh boy! Wrong mistake! One bite out of the \"shut the cluck up\", we definitely shut the f*** up and were eating in complete silence. We felt the heat coming out of our ears, started to get sweaty, tears started streaming down, and even our face felt a little tingly. We tried to let it pass, because we refused to pay for an overpriced drink from the mini fridge but it was definitely an emergency situation. We ended up grabbing a $8 coconut water from the Cosmos mini fridge. That still did not suppress our burning tongues, so in the middle of eating, we ran down the hallway to fill our bucket with ice. That was our lifesaver! At this point we still had two chicken strips left between two people. In between eating a piece of chicken, we would ice our tongues. Lol! Despite the heat, the chicken was juicy, flavorful and fried to perfection. For the sides, we tried the Mac and cheese, potato salad, and the coleslaw. The Mac and cheese and potato salad was bomb, however their coleslaw was pretty bland. So to sum everything up, if you decide to try the chicken in the \"shut the cluck up\"... make sure you have a drink and some ice!!!",

I've been searching all over for a place that could come close to it so when I heard they were opening up a spot in Vegas I was ecstatic. I decided to make the trip out to have a try and I hate to admit it, but I was sadly disappointed. The Vegas location seemed like an airport version of the restaurant I fell in love with in Nashville.  The flavor was almost there but it just wasn't right. I ordered the half chicken with fries and Mac n cheese. The sides were good, kinda hard to mess that part up. The chicken....not so much. The meat was dry and the dredge was hard as a rock. Think about a very thick, over fried, tortilla chip.  Overall, it wasn't the worst hot chicken I've ever had but, it doesn't hold a candle to Hattie B's in Nashville. If you are in the L.A. area you are much better off waiting in the line for Howlin' Rays. Now that place will not disappoint.",

It was thrilling to see them open one in Las Vegas -without a doubt- I hopped in and ate when I was in town chilling. Long story short, no matter you like the chicken or not, this does not taste original or authentic, not even close to the ones in Nashville (Charlotte Pike or Broadway) where long waiting line speaks to itself. Chicken was tender but not flavorful and the spice does not blended right. However, the best part was their homemade ranch dressing. That's that. Won't be back to this one in LV",

    "text": "When I heard about Hattie's opening, I was pretty curious and excited! I LOVE hot chicken. My friends and I have even endured the crazy 2+ hour line for Howling Ray's in Los Angeles to get them!   My friends and I got to try Hattie B's on Labor Day since we all had the day off. It was perfect because they opened up Labor Day weekend -- the whole Block 16 Urban Food Hall opened up Labor Day weekend!  We decided to share two orders of their small dark, which consists of a leg/thigh quarter. Each order was $9.00 each, which is really fairly priced for them being in a casino. Each order comes with two sides as well. We got one of them in medium spicy and one of them in damn hot. For sides, we got their mac and cheese, crinkle cut fries, coleslaw, and potatoe salad.   The chicken itself is very tender, soft, and juicy. As far as how it would taste really depends on what spice level you get. The medium spice chicken was really delicious. It was a little spicy and a little sweet -- a good combination over all. The damned hot chicken, however, had no flavor besides the spice. We were severely disappointed in that. Was it too spicy that I can't taste the spice? No. I've had Howling Ray's spiciest level on the menu and they used Carolina reapers for that one. Hattie B's damned hot does not use Carolina reapers. It seems like Hattie B's is so focused on making the chicken spicy that they forgot to actually season the chicken. Spice was all it was.   To confirm that thought, I tried a piece of my friend's chicken tender. He had gotten it in \"shut the cluck up\" level, which is their spiciest level and it was the same. The chicken had no flavor -- all I could taste was the spice.   All the sides were pretty decent.   My recommendation is that if you're going to eat at Hattie B's, choose medium or lower as your spice so you can get the full flavor of everything. Regardless, the prices are reasonable because you get TWO sides with your order. Downside is that because you're in a casino, they don't believe in free drinking water. You would have to buy your drink if you did not bring one with you. Also, they ran out of ranch when we were there. How do you run out of ranch? Beats me.  Overall, pretty decent. I would probably say it'd be a 3.5 stars out of 5. As a local, I wouldn't come here specifically for Hattie B's though.",

The fried chicken is delicious. It is hot and juicy with lots of flavour. Medium spicy is the perfect level of hotness. One thing that I did not understand is that they force you to pay a tip but also make you pick up your own food at the counter and don't serve anything. So why am I forced to pay a tip when I'm not even being serviced? Thought that was absurd.  Hattie B's is delicious. Even though it is not in Nashville, this location is as good as the original.",

Looking at the menu this place gives you a deal compared to other places since you get 2 sides with your chicken plate. I ordered the 3 jumbo chicken tenders with the southern greens and cole slaw. When they say jumbo they mean it! These chicken tenders had so much meat that I couldn't even finish them myself. As for the chicken I ordered it mild with the sriracha sauce. The seasoning was too salty for me, but the crisp was perfect. Mild flavor wasn't too spicy, but good enough to make your nose run. As for the southern greens.... you can do without them. They needed some extra flavoring. The cole slaw was ok. As I was trying to be semi healthy with the sides I chose these items, but next time I would order the fries and mac and cheese. Def recommend this place! Next time I go to Vegas I know where I am going and what sides to get.",

I must admit this is way spicier than i like but the chicken is so flavorful and portion is amazing definitely worth the price.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese and baked beans, yes yes the perfect sides for this great chicken!   This place is located at the Cosmopolitan in a small food court area on the second floor. Cant go wrong with this spot after partying.",

    "text": "Great addition to the Cosmo.  Located inside Block 16- reminds me of a small Chelsea market in NY or Anaheim Packing District.    Nashville chicken in vegas. For the 1/2 chicken with additional tenders and chicken sandwich.  I love spicy food so getting a medium for the sandwich- it has a good kick- great flavor.    The chicken is moist and tasty.  Got three different slides - potato salad and fries are ok.  Must get the pimento Mac and cheese- great flavor.     Menu is simple.  They offer some beer on tap.   There some seating around their booth. Got our food within 5 minutes.  Service girl where you pick up the food is very passive and not helpful- my only complain.  Another customer helped me bag my to go boxes.",

Like they legit wouldn't stop talking about this place lol. So the inner foodie in me felt like I cheated the system and had to try it. The friends that I went to Vegas on this trip also went to the original location and were excited as well.  One thing you need to know about me is that I like heat, but can't handle THAT much heat. I wish I could, truly I do. So I had to settle for the chicken sandwich with the lowest amount of spice (forgot if it's mild or whatever it's called). As for a side, I got the mac and cheese. I was a bit disappointed my the mac. I thought it would be better. The sandwich was pretty good, but not the BEST I've had. It's probably due to the fact that I was still full from the meal I had earlier in the day. It was pretty good, but I heard they're known for their hot chicken. I had a bit of it and it was better than what I got for sure.  Maybe if I build my tolerance one day, I can tackle the hot chicken.",

I would rather have juicy, flavorful meat and lightly seasoned skin than hot sauce overcompensating for dry meat.",

Coming from LA, I'd say it's comparable to Howling Ray's (and without the two hour wait!). I like the comeback sauce a lot and it feels less heavy. My favorite side that I tried was the potato salad although the fries were ok too. The coleslaw is just the same one in the chicken sandwich so I wouldn't get that one.  I actually think the price is reasonable ($14 for sandwich and one side) on the Strip. However, the no tap water option really bothers me (isn't even restaurant legally obligated to provide upon request?).",

    "text": "It's time to come clean: Perhaps I sometimes base my trips around places where I am going to eat. And I'm not ashamed. Last time I was in town, Block 16 didn't exist, and now I was looking forward to trying a couple of their offerings. Hattie B's was up first.   I show up on a Wednesday night and gauging from the other businesses, this one has a line. I'm third in line, but I remained third for quite a while, as in, five minutes. Figure it's worth the wait so I stuck with. Guy behind me was getting impatient though, which I can understand if looking from a different perspective. I'm trying to be positive here so I remain.   Finally, I placed my order of (3) tenders (southern style), fries, ranch sauce and cole slaw. Now I wasn't sure if the delay prior to me was the guy having issues ordering or if it was the cashier but I soon discovered it was the cashier. I handed her my Identity card, and she appeared confused. Then she asked if I was charging this to the room and I said if it's easier for her, yes. I provide her with my room # and ID, then she wants my credit card so I thought she was going to charge me instead. After all this, she ended up charging my room. This took a few minutes in itself for her to do.   As for the food, I have to say my favorite of all was...the pickles. I'm not kidding. Obviously that's probably not a good thing as I had more of this meal to tackle. I usually enjoy crinkle fries, but the seasoning just didn't appeal to me. Cole slaw was okay. But the chicken just didn't do it for me. I will be honest and say since I had this as mild as can be, this could have been the reason why. But it is an option, and I guess I expected more.   On the upside, although the service at the register was slow as molasses, she was nice. And the girl who handed me my food to go was sweet as well. Perhaps their Nashville location surpasses here and is worthy of a visit, it certainly sounds amazing according to other reviewers who were fortunate to compare.   This was my first meal for my trip here, and so far, I'm a little let down. Hoping for a different experience on my next trip down Block 16-",

Honestly I didn't have big expectations of this place but we love it so much that we end up going three times during our trip because so far the chicken it's so rich in flavor so juicy and it's a really good portion. I tried the chicken sandwich and it was amazing! All the combinations and the flavors are mixed with cole salad and their dressing.  The first time I went I ordered it with Mac and cheese which it wasn't my favorite but my husband loved it.  Next time I had it with the fries and they were so good. And the last time I went I had the tenders which I only had two (comes with 3 tenders) and I was so full!  The tender comes with two sides so I had the cole salad and fries again. The salad was okay and the tenders were good, not dry and they were huge but I rather have the sandwich again.  So if it's your first time try it! You won't regret.  Their staff isn't the friendliest but it didn't bother me at all, I only order my food and that's it. I can't wait to go back in town and try this place again.",

Especially since the original location in Nashville has a 4.5 star rating with 4,000+ reviews. My bf and I ordered the small dark hot plate. The chicken was crunchy and juicy and seasoned to perfection and not overly oily. The sides we got were the pimiento mac n cheese and potato salad. Both I highly recommend to order. The mac and cheese was the best I've EVER had at any chicken joint! I actually enjoyed these sides more than the ones Ive had at Howlin' Rays! We also ordered the chicken sandwich medium spice. The size was perfect and dressed nicely with just the right amounts of comeback sauce and slaw. My only regret was that i wish we ordered it spicier. Unfortunately the only downside to this meal was that the fries were a little bit cold by the time we got our food, but that I was able to over look cause everything else was so good!",

    "text": "Definitely knocking the heat down to appeal to regular Vegas folks, but nonetheless really great fried chicken and enough heat to keep you asking for water and longing for more. We had the large white meat cluckin hot and regular heat. The skin is just the best and the meat was huge with two pieces of white bread and 2 sides for $15. In Vegas this is outstanding value. The collard greens were a little dry and needed some meat flavor but still fine for your green fix. The Mac and cheese was slimy and had a nice pimento to spice - worth an order for sure. Opt for the sweet and spicy sauce as well for dipping. Overall this tastes the same as Hattie B's in Nashville and you can get it with a short line in Cosmo. Fantastic!",

Cole slaw is good. Potato salad is cooked well but lacks salt. Sandwich is great but can get salty at times (ordered it a few times now). Fries are good. Overall value for the food is good.   Last time i ordered i paid for extra sauce and they forgot it and i didn't realize it till i got home :(  Check your orders before you walk away, but i guess that's a general rule everywhere",

The coleslaw doesn't have as much mayo as other place's and the mac n cheese contains japalenos for some heat.  Yum!  As for the chicken it is usually served on toast with some pickles.

I thought Howlin' Ray's was decent but when I heard that Hattie B's is a must when in Nashville and it opened its first west coast branch in Vegas? I knew I had to check it out.   They recently got rid of their large white/large dark options - bummer (double thighs are always better). So my husband and I ended up sharing a mild half bird, sides of collard green + fries, and sweet tea. We really loved the marinade/seasoning. The skin was perfectly crisped and the spice was so yummy. The paired honey mustard sauce? Not needed. The sides were good but not outstanding. The sweet tea is a must. They do offer one free refill (they don't tell u or advertise it - my husband actually bought a second tea... only to see a regular asked for refill soon after).   Overall - I would say it actually beats Howlin' Ray's. Maybe Hattie B's should consider opening a branch here in LA?",

We ordered the 2 pc white meat plates, medium heat,  with Mac & cheese , greens, red skin potato salad ( not pictured ) , and the banana pudding ( not pictured) .   The chicken was so good and tender . The seasonings on the skin were so good . The only thing that I could say is WATCH out with the heat . I love spicy things ... I put hot sauce on just about everything and the medium heat was pretty hot . The Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious . The pimento added a nice little kick to it. The greens were tender and had a great flavor to them . I normally am not a huge fan of potato salad but this potato salad was perfect . It had big chunks of potatoes and it was NOT sweet so I thought it was great . Lastly, the banana pudding was delightful . It was sweet but not too sweet and the banana flavor didn't taste artificial like the other banana puddings I have tried  .   The prices were reasonable and the food came out quick. Also, the guy who rang us up was nice. Overall , Great experience . If you're on the strip or even just looking for a good place for fried chicken ...LOOK NO FURTHER Hattie B 's is your place .",

So they told us it would be a 20 minute wait for a new batch, or we could substitute for something else, such as tenders. We ended up getting the tenders, but I really wanted my husband to try the dark meat since I had had it in Nashville. The second time I went, which was in late April, they never made my order. I waited at the bar stool for quite some time, at least 15 if not more minutes. I had even asked if they called my name and they just responded no, so I waited longer. When I go up again, they search for my order and their response is, \"Oh, sometimes the orders get lost.\" Definitely not my issue and Hattie B needs to fix their computer system if that's the case. This was my lunch before having to rush back to the airport, so waiting this long was horrible! As for the food, the fries and macaroni and cheese are to die for! If you like hot, get the hot chicken!",

For dipping sauce, I had the ranch which was perfect to cut the heat of the chicken. The hot preparation was just right - not too spicy but definitely packed a smoky heat that, when mixed with the oils of the fried chicken, was very satisfying. The coleslaw was actually very good and the pimento Mac n Cheese had a nice kick in addition to a creamy texture. The chicken is placed on top of a simple piece of white bread which absorbs the oils and spices of the chicken as you cut through the crispy skin.   Definitely a memorable spot and very reasonably priced as well! Look forward to trying the popular tenders next time.",

    "text": "If you take one thing away from this review, know that the chickens at Hattie's are yuge. I ordered a 1/2 chicken, expecting a small Cornish hen. What they gave me can only be described as the Lebron James of chickens, the son of Zeus, an absolute unit with a full-ride scholarship to the University of Alabama. It cost $19.00 and is served with two sides. I ate half at the bar and then the other half at 3am. If you don't mind sharing food, share this with one other person.   I've only had Nashville Hot chicken on three occasions, including this meal at Hattie's. In terms of flavor, Hattie's was my least favorite among the three, unfortunately. I ordered it Hot, which is the 3rd highest on their spicy scale. I like spicy food and it was hot enough to make my nose run.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, real \"crispy boys.\" The flavor was a little weird, though. I think they needed to change the batch of oil or something. No joke, the flavor tasted like Hot Cheetos. I wouldn't be surprised if they used that for breading. My girlfriend ordered the Southern (not spicy) and it was a better decision.  All in all, Hattie's is a good option within the Cosmopolitan and in Vegas in general. It's not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it's far from bad. I'd eat it again.",

    "text": "Nashville hot chicken is comprised of 3 components: bread, chicken, and pickle. You don't find a lot of restaurants around the Seattle area that offer this so I jumped at the chance of trying Hattie B's in Las Vegas's Cosmopolitan hotel.   I came here by myself torn between getting the sandwich or the plate. I love the simplicity of the menu. I ended up choosing the small dark - leg/thigh quarter with 2 sides. I chose pimento mac & cheese and southern greens.  I chose 'HOT!' as the spice level. It goes hotter too!! I do love some spicy food and the hot was perfect. Hot enough to feel it and make me sweat a little but not enough to make it painful. I was still able to enjoy to heat and my food.   Oh man, this is probably one of the best fried chicken I ever had. That crust was like a hard shell of spiced armor that you get to crack open to find a juicy dark meat surprise. The mac & cheese was creamy and smooth. Had a little bit of spicy kick from the pimento. The southern greens were tender and had some fatty pork bites to add flavor.  I drank a slushee of maple moonshine and amaretto to wash all of that down. A perfect meal that I would recommend to anyone.",

The Chicken is awesome, got Medium and it was perfect amount of heat. Slaw was also on point.   Can't compare with original Hattie's but as a LA native who waited in line at Howlin Rays for 2 hrs. Imo this was not as good as Howlin Rays, but it's still damn good! Really can't go wrong with spicy hot fried chicken.     I really love the fast casual food court concept at Cosmo! Easily accessible, affordable, delicious food.",

With the amount of fanfare this place gets, I was surprised there wasn't a longer line. The service is pretty quick, although they don't provide cups of water. I would hit up a neighboring food stand to ask for water cups because you're going to need it.  The plate combinations are a great option since they come with 2 sides and a sauce. I got a large dark plate (2 pieces of fried chicken) and picked cole slaw and mac n cheese as my sides. The fried chicken here is juicy and perfectly crispy! It's strange how the chicken comes on top of a boring ol' slice of bread. After thinking about it, I believe the bread was there to balance out the saltiness because the chicken is a tad on the salty side. Hence why I said you need a water cup! The mac n cheese was delicious... so creamy! I'm a huge mac n cheese fan and I wish I ordered two sides of mac n cheese. On the other hand, I thought the cole slaw was your typical cole slaw.   The hit at Hattie B's is definitely the fried chicken and they fry it well here. It's juicy and crispy. If there was one knock on it, it'd be the saltiness. Get that water cup!",

So we finally tried it on our second visit and it was just so disappointing   It's inside the cosmopolitan inside the food court place and so it's kind of hard finding a place to sit when you're going during rush times. We got 2 half bird combos and so we tried a variety of sides (mac n cheese, coleslaw, fries)   -Mac N Cheese: SO BLAND, literally felt like eating cardboard. Felt like kraft was way better -Coleshaw: it was literally cabbage mixed with water. All I tasted was water -French Fries: fries were normal, average - only side we could eat with our chickens  The chicken itself was unfortunately really bland - I expected WAY more from this place - we got the hot level and didn't feel anything - the chicken was moist - but there was not an OOOMF flavor or anything - unfortunately, just basic chicken with bad sides",

It's inside a food court, albeit a fancy food court in the Cosmopolitan, that puts most food courts in the world to shame.   I was craving a fried chicken sandwich and decided to finally check this place out. I was happy I did. I went with the spicy sandwich and fries. The chicken and sauce were extremely flavorful, and the bun complimented the chicken well. The fries were a bonus, mainly because crinkle cut fries are my favorite from the fried potato family.   Major props to the gal working the register. She was friendly and patient, which I think would be hard to do. This was a Friday night, and she remained calm and cool and still had a smile on her face, even though she had to deal with a long line of customers with drunk munchies. Hats off to Hattie B's in the Cosmo.",

    "text": "If you have ever tried Hot Chicken Takeover you will find Hattie B's very similar.  It's tucked into the new and very cool Cosmopolitan food court on the second floor.  The menu is very simple and easy to navigate. White or dark meat or tenders as well as different sizes.  Two sides per meal are included plus your choice of sauce.  You can choose the \"hotness\" level as well.    Prices seemed pretty reasonable for the amount of food and the fact that you're at a hotel on the strip in Vegas with the exception of the sodas.  $5 for a CAN of soda (not even a cup you can refill at a fountain) is ludicrous extortion.  The tenders did not look like ordinary tenders and were sort of weird, twisted shapes.  They were juicy and for \"medium\" they were plenty spicy though quite salty.  The \"greens\" and potato salad were pretty decent sides.  The greens had some sort of meat (ham? bacon?) inside which gave them a nice, smoky sort of flavor.  The honey mustard sauce was fairly standard.  The bread underneath the tenders was kind of gross and definitely poor quality.    Overall, this was a solidly decent meal but was honestly nothing spectacular.",

While the macaroni and cheese is made with pimento cheese (not everyone's favorite) the collard greens are fantastic!

    "text": "Situated in Block 16 of the Cosmopolitan, Hattie B's, right next to Pok Pok. It was tough deciding which to go to but I already had the original Pok Pok, the decision was made. As mentioned, this place started out of Nashville.  Looking forward to it, seeing that it has the longest line of the small joints in block 16, It may have been over hyped for me.  Got in line, which didn't take too long, and got to the front. Looked at the menu and instantly knew I wanted bone in chicken (bone in is better than boneless) more flavor imo, so a small in dark meat in spicy or 2nd to the hottest with side orders of Mac and cheese and fries. My friend ordered the boneless chicken fingers in mild with fries and potato salad. Both orders with ranch on the side. During this whole event of ordering, the lady taking my order had other things in mind. We noticed she kept on talking to her coworker on the other register, no biggie, sounded as if she was training and asking questions. We tell her the first order. She turns, talks to her coworker, turns back to us, \"hi, what is your order?\" (Amerika). Thinking she typed it in the first time, we tell her again. She seemed to have been done putting another order in. Turns again and talks to her coworker. And what happens next, she asks for our order again. This went on for maybe 5 or 6 more times. We placed the same order three times and then the next order, the same thing. My friends and I are just looking at each other like what the f is going on here? Finally got done ordering and waited.  Didn't take too long to get our order as I heard my name being called. Walked over and noticed none of the orders had any sauce. Asked the guy cooking for some, since I refused to talk to the lady again, and he was cool about it. He looked at the receipts before giving them but it's cool, he was just making sure.  The chicken, came really breaded but stale. Seemed as if they may have left it in the fryer too long. The skin, which is my favorite, was unbreakable. Put it aside. The meat was very tender, almost too tender. Fall off the bone, Yes! But oil may have been reused too many times that we tasted a hint of that fish was maybe cooked in the fryer before the chicken? So I saved the rest for my dog. Actually the fingers also went to my dog.  Saved the day with their Mac and cheese. Noodles were perfect and it was a cheesy creamy. Crinkle fries were the best part. Seasoned and crispy. I'm not sure about the potato salad as I didn't try it or forgot to ask about it, but my friend said it was good.  Overall, was a disappointment. Maybe it might be different at the original joint or just in Nashville in general. Two stars for the sides, Mac and cheese and fries and oh I forgot, pricing isn't too bad here. Paid 50 for 3 orders and a few drinks (strip pricing). I ended up getting a beer across the way which complemented the fries.",

    "text": "Gosh, how I dislike writing 2 star reviews.  I very seldom rate less than 3 stars, but unfortunately this just wasn't good enough to get the \"A-OK\" nod.  We were so excited to try Hattie B's after watching a few reviews on YouTube.  However, the excitement quickly phased into regret once we began eating.  My wife & I each ordered a Small Dark plate (1 = Mild & 1 = Medium).  The Mild had 0 flavor was oily & slimy.  The Medium had a bland spice flavor and was also oily & slimy.    Sides were 2 Pimento Mac & Cheese (= Below Average), 1 Creamy Cole Slaw (= Average), 1 Potato Salad (= Average), an order of Crinkle Cut Fries (= Good) for the little guy & a couple of each of the sauces (Ranch = Terrible - Blue Cheese = Terrible - Honey Mustard = Average + - Nashville Comeback Sauce = Honestly Don't Remember).  The sauces are pre-packaged and taste like it.  To be fair, I need to note, we liked the chicken better when eaten on the bread with the pickle.  The slime factor was reduced when eating it that way.    So, if we go back, which we probably won't since there's a few thousand places we've yet to try in Vegas, we'll get a Chicken Sandwich.",

    "text": "We walked by and spotted the infamous Hattie B's Hot Chicken. It was a nice surprise since I didn't know their was one in Vegas and have heard about this place a lot from friends who visit Nashville and people on the internet who claims it's the best hot chicken in Nashville from people who live there. I tell my friends about all the stuff I've heard about this place and they are down to try it out too.  Looking at the menu, everything looked good, but had to go with the fried chicken, not the sandwich the first trip, so I opted for the dark meat. I asked about the heat levels and the cashier said that all the heat levels are probably one heat higher than most places would consider hot. So instead of going crazy, I went with medium heat so I could enjoy it, but also add a tender for $3 that I got SHUT THE CLUCK UP!!! so I can see just how hot it really is. As for sides, I asked her what she recommended, which she said fries and pimento mac n cheese. Instead of doing two heavy sides, I did the pimento mac n cheese and coleslaw so I can have something to calm down the heat if it really is that hot.  Dark Meat Medium heat - Damn good flavor and super juicy. This was some great fried chicken, although I wish it had a bit more meat on it. There was areas I bit into that was just breading. Also keep in mind its not two separate pieces, but both connected together. The medium heat had a good kick which was enjoyable. It was a good heat level and this is from a guy who loves hot sauces. I've taken the last dab quite a bit and can handle pretty hot, but only if it's a enjoyable flavor too, not hot for the sake of being hot.  Shut The Cluck Up!!! Tender - Damn! I cut a piece off of it about the size you would see at Costco in one of those tasting booths they have. Right off the bat you know the heat was no joke and it just builds up from there. I got the hiccups from it and ate some slaw to calm it down a bit, but still burned for several minutes. It was at that point I decided it was in my best interest to not eat any more of it. It was early into the night, we were there for the NightClub and Bar Show, about to go to the welcome party and have a long night of drinking. I feared this would either mess up my stomach and ruin the night or I would regret it later when it came out. Again I like heat, but only with flavor, and felt like it was mostly just hot.  Pimento Mac n Cheese - Ok Pimento cheese isn't exactly what I would think of adding to Mac n Cheese, but they showed me how wrong I have been. Me and my friends all agreed this was some of the best mac we have ever had. It is a must every trip from now on to Hattie B's.  Coleslaw - Let's be real here, there probably isn't going to be any coleslaw out there that someone raves about. It's good, decent, or bad. This was good slaw, fresh, slightly chilled, and a good side to go with hot chicken.   For $11 for the meal, it's pricey for a normal place, but a deal in Vegas, I honestly probably could have taken down the half bird myself or done a good job trying. I would like to try the Hot Chicken Sandwich and had several people at the restaurant rave about it to me that it's a must while we were in line. if your unsure about the heat level and want to try hotter, I recommended adding a tender for $3 and doing that at the hottest level you want to try so you don't waste your money.",

The price isn't insane considering it's Vegas and also since it's not simply just chicken, but chicken with sides.   Friend and I ordered the Hot Chicken Sandwich with crinkle cut fries to split and it did not disappoint. We got the sandwich at the medium heat level and it had our lips stinging in a good way. The heat is offset by the cool and creamy coleslaw and bread and butter pickles. The sandwich is on a soft slightly sweet bun (I think brioche) that compliments the spicy crunchiness of the chicken. The sandwich came out piping hot and the fries were perfectly crispy.   I can't wait to go back and try their spiciest level and see if I survive.",

The counter woman was super nice and pleasant. Menu is not complicated. I ordered the large combo which was supposed to be two leg/thigh quarters and two sides.  I had greens and fries as my sides. I got medium spice.  The order was actually incorrect to my favor. One of the pieces was a breast wing piece.    The chicken took 5 minutes to e ready. My order was hot and totally flavorful.  The medium had just enough spice. Any hotter and I would not have been able to taste the actual flavor of the food. The greens were well seasoned and the fries had some sort of seasoned salt on them.  Overall, I give this location a very enthusiastic thumbs up!!   Also, the restaurant was kept clean. The cleaning guy came thru at least four times while I was there.",

The people that works here needs more training or learn how to be nice and happy working at Hattie B's!  Come to Los Angeles and learn from the pros at Howlin Rays!  They'll show you customer service!! The girl at the register should be more enthusiastic instead of being so dull when taking orders   Their pretty stingy and tight on charging you extra comeback sauces! At Howlin, they hook you up with sauces cuz they know you'll be coming back for more!",

My friend ordered the same except medium spice level and with sides of Mac and cheese and red skin potato salad. In my opinion, the fried chicken was bigger, more crispier, tastier and juicer compared to Howlin's. I also liked how they also had more side options as well. The fries were of course delicious and crispy, just how I like them. Potato salad was also really good as well. If you can handle the heat, medium level will be a good level to start at. If you can't, be like me and stick with mild. All in all this was one of the best fried chicken places I've been to so I will definitely be back.",

ENVIRONMENT: This is within a little food hall on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, next to the entrance of Marquee. There's always a long line for this place! Despite the long line, the food was done super fast.    FOOD: My bf and I shared the HALF BIRD w/ MEDIUM SPICE and it was plenty of food for us. It came with bread slices and 2 sides. We were given dark and white meat. The chicken was so juicy and tender! Medium spice wasn't too spicy for us, so we could have handled the hot spice. Since we were drinking later that night, sticking to medium spice was perfect. They offer a variety of sauces but we chose their NASHVILLE COMEBACK SAUCE (made with mayonnaise, honey and their signature spice blend.) This reminded me of Raising Cane's sauce!  As for the sides, we ordered the PIMENTO MAC & CHEESE and CREAMY COLE SLAW. The pimento mac & cheese was sooo good! It had a light kick of spice to it and was super cheesy. The cole slaw was a good call since it helped lighten up our heavy meal. For dessert, we ordered the BANANA PUDDING. It was so good! I love that there were Nilla wafer on top to add texture.   OVERALL: For the quality, price (~$20), and quantity of this meal, it was very worth! The service was fast and the food was delicious. I highly recommend ordering the banana pudding and pimento mac & cheese! Compared to Howlin Rays in LA, their breading and spice flavor here isn't as good/strong but still decent enough to come back here again.",

We got the half chicken at medium spice with a side of fries and southern greens and a sandwich at hot spice with a side if mac and cheese. The chicken was moist, but the skin could have been crispier. I noticed that the sandwich they gave us didn't include cole slaw, so I had to go back up to the counter and ask for a side of it. Not a huge deal, but also not a great sign. I mean, how do you forget one of 5 ingredients in the sandwich? Both the mac and cheese and southern greens were nothing special. They did give us a ton of fries, which were pretty good.  If you live in San Francisco, there's a Nashville hot chicken sandwich pop up called Hotbirds that is way better. Go check them out!",

The menu is very simple,very easy to navigate and order. I decided on the 3 Strips and 2 sides plate which was $11. I had gotten 2 of my strips in Hot! and 1 in Damn Hot!!& for my sides,  Did Mac n cheese and fries! The price was excellent for the amount of food, i received. Now this is my only issue with this spot, and the reason i deducted 1 star. The soda was $5 for a can of pepsi. Yes you heard me right, & they dont offer fountain soda! To me this was a big let down because I knew my chicken would be spicy and I really wanted a nice soda as a compliment and to wash it down, but I just couldn't pay $5 for a 12 oz of Pepsi so if you come here stop And get you a soda before you come in. The food was excellent I really like the flavors of the chicken I don't even think the hottest one was too unbearable and the sides were really good as well this place definitely had some comeback chicken for me if I'm ever in town again this will definitely be a regular stop!",

Ordered ours medium spicy along with some sides and grabbed a table. Food came out relatively quickly and chicken was hot and fresh with a nice outer crunch and moist and tender interior. The spiciness was enjoyable but prefer the slightly more sweet, complex flavors of howlin' ray's. Sides were decent but forgettable, portions were a good size but priced to match, being to avoid howlin' ray's 3 hour lines is nice. Great option, nice food hall in general to go to with a group of friends since folks can enjoy different types of food in the same casual spot",

But good for people who don't like spicy. Decent portion.   Sauce: 3/5 I'm personally not a fan. The sauce tasted like a sriracha mayo it wasn't for me.   Mac'n Cheese: 5/5 FANTASTIC.

    "text": "Lets just say Im a fan of spicy chicken and enjoy trying this Nashville take on things. Heard about Hattie Bs coming to Cosmopolitan and yesterday, after reading many reviews, finally tried it.   The reviews are just about correct: the meat is kinda flavorless, a lot of the meals are enough for 2 people, its really salty, the fries arent that great and its a good value for on and off the Strip.  I ordered the Tenders meal Hot to-go because i wasnt paying $7 for parking. There wasnt much of a line and theyll have you in and out in 5-7 mins. I got home and dug in. The 3 tenders are HUGE and nothing like the small three strips youll get at fast food places. The coleslaw was bland, the Ranch sauce was runny and lacked a punch and the fries were crispy but were boring! The saving grace was the chicken but even half way threw my second one i wanted water and had to call it quits. It just wasnt tasty enough to finish.   For chicken with a kick and spice i was underwhelmed. The location is great and so was service, but the food didnt carry the hype. I tried Daves Hot Chicken in LA and that has this place beat. I suppose its just something about the spice blend that makes or breaks Nashville Hot Chicken.   I would only go back to Hattie Bs to try the bone-in chicken options and thats about it. There are about 6 other food options at this Urban Food Hall and they are also on my list to try.",

    "text": "I just stumbled into this while exploring the Cosmo. I just had a friend saying they were going to try the famous Hattie B's in Tennessee on their upcoming vacation, so was thrilled I could give it a go myself.  I'm not really a prolific friend chicken eater and am a rube when it comes to \"hot chicken\" having never had it before. I got the the \"hot\" level. They warned me to perhaps go down a level, I'm assuming people complain it's too hot. But I found it just right here. It was spicy enough to sweat, but not novelty level spicy. The chicken itself was moist. The breading was crisp. My only complaint was that maybe it was a bit too greasy and salty, but then again that might be exactly what people want. I wasn't drunk at the time, but if I was I think I might have said it's the exact right amount of grease and salt.   I got pimento cheese mac and coleslaw for the sides. Pimento cheese is a bit foreign to me. A lot of times mac and cheese at southern places is disappointing. It rarely seems to be made with high quality cheese and based on a roux/bechamel and such. And okay, pimento cheese is not really high quality cheese. . .but something about it worked. It felt like a much higher quality version of the boxed mac & cheese we grew up on. It wasn't gourmet, but it was still way better than most mac & cheese one gets at a casual place.   So yeah, I have no idea how this compares to the \"real\" Hattie B's original location or other hot chicken joints. But it did the job and felt like a good value while roaming around on the strip. . .the chicken strip. Sorry, that was a terrible dad joke. Probably not even as good as a dad joke. But I never hit backspace when writing these things. I just babble and babble until I feel like stopping babbling. . .",

It's in a food court in the Cosmopolitan, so not a lot of seating, but that's on the hotel, not this restaurant. We squeezed in to the booth in the back at just the right time-sitting next door to the secret bar door. Funny to watch people coming by trying to find this door. But, anyway, the bread was fresh, but even the mild seasoning was a little hot for me, but it was so good, I wolfed it down. The only reason for not giving the full 5 stars is the price. For three sandwiches and drinks, it was $72. A bit much for three sandwiches, but we knew that when we were standing there. I'll definitely visit again.",

The pasta was so soft, it was mush.  Ate here again today. Got the small dark plus a tender. Again, the breading and spice level was great. The actual meat of the thigh and drumstick was juicy, but the taste was whatever. The tender was tasty and great. I almost think they're over salting the breading and skin, but I like salty so it was fine for me. The collard greens were yummy, and the crinkle fries were awesome (and spicy).

Whether you get the chicken or chicken in sandwich form, both come with the same spices. The heat isn't what you would expect, it's more of a spice dry blend instead of wet. The spice can get can get salty, it did for me at least, so I would be cautious of the the spice level. The fries were good, but a bit salty. I think they were similar spices as the chicken. I would have preferred basic salt to change up the flavor profile. The chicken sandwich was okay. I just felt the breast meat was pressed together and not a plumpy as I was expecting.",

Seating here may seem limited, but if you're vigilant you'll be able to grab a spot.  For my first time here I opted for the 3 tenders. I got one hot and one mild. I only tolerate spicy foods and the mild was actually pretty spicy for me. The chicken itself was pretty good, albeit a little dry at parts. Our meal came with two sides, and we opted for the fries and the pimento Mac and cheese. The fries were seasoned, but just average. The Mac and cheese was creamy and gooey, but the pimento or any kind of heat was absent.   I also tried the sweet tea sloshy which was refreshing. It's not too too boozy. If I come again I'll be sure to try the lemonade.   Now of course people (especially those from SoCal) are going to ask: how does it compare to Howlin' Ray's? Spice is relative, but I will say that Hattie B's uses a drier rub. Howlin' Ray's coats a sauce on the chicken before the extra dry spice is sprinkled on. But if this is a battle of strictly chicken, I'd give Howlin' Ray's the upper hand.",

The 2 pieces I had were way overcooked and tasted like eating spicy burned bacon. If I hadn't got the order to go I would have returned it. Not enjoyable to eat.  Also, I know Hattie's spice levels. We ordered medium because my SO was not in the mood for spicy. Pretty sure they gave us Damn Hot. Definitely hotter than \"Hot!\" my usual. Which made the burned flavor even worse.  The sides were great as usual. Potato salad and coleslaw were spot on.  Hey Hattie's in Nashville, please spend some time training the employees in LV as they need some attention.",

    "text": "For our two night trip to Vegas, we were only having one meal that wouldn't be at a buffet so we had to choose wisely. After having Hattie B's recommended to us by our shuttle driver and seeing all the great reviews on Yelp, we decided we couldn't miss out on this!  First things first -- the chicken is not very crispy. We were debating whether we should eat at the food hall or if we should bring it back up to our hotel room and we decided to take it back since the place was poppin', and I don't know if that affected the crispiness of the chicken. But I mean, it took like 5-10 minutes to take it back so it shouldn't have been that soggy right? So that was a little disappointing. If it wasn't for the lack of crisp and crunch, I definitely would have given Hattie B's 5 stars because everything else about it was pretty damn perfect!  Got potato salad and mac on the side which were both great. The mac and cheese was unbelievably cheesy, which is great for any cheese lover like me. I do wish the bread was toasted or something, but I guess after eating my chicken tenders I realized this place might not specialize in crispy/crunchiness? Haha. The chicken tenders were amazingly juicy and soft though. And the flavor of the chicken is great. I love flavorful things!  So all in all, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick meal, or maybe looking to save your money for other things in Vegas. Also located in a pretty convenient area if you ask me.",

So how does Hattie B's fare?  The two of us got the best of both worlds: dark meat combo and sandwich combo, with sides of their mac n cheese, cole slaw, and potato salad. All of the sides were a bit bland but not terrible. But obviously, the star of the show was the chicken - very moist pieces of chicken with crispy breading that was tastefully spiced. Spice lovers be warned - even the \"Hot\" level was pretty tame. Next time, I'd give their spiciest level a shot.  It wouldn't really be fair to compare it with Howlin' Rays. They're two different types of great hot chicken.",

The sides are really good as well.   I felt cheated when I had to pay 5.00 for a soda. Luckily this was a business mean. I should drop off one start because 5.00 for a soda is absurd lol.   The people that work here are very nice though. Also the food comes out in a very timely manner. Next time I am in Dallas I'll be sure to go to Hattie b's. Do yourself a favor and give them a shot!",

    "text": "The new Cosmo \"food hall\" has been something I wanted to check out but it's a bit of a misnomer. It's more of a food court with a couple of restaurants and communal seating.  Since I just visited Nashville for the first time and never quite made it to the famous Hattie B's hot fried chicken, I made the trek to the Strip to try it.  The first impression was the stench of grease. My clothes started stinking of stale oil the second I got in line to order. It's overpowering and unpleasant.  I ordered the Nashville hot chicken tenders with two sides (cole slaw and Southern greens) and an iced tea. They allow you ONE refill on your drink, so it's best to ration it out because the chicken is HOT! Hubby had the classic hot chicken plate, which is obviously the thing to order. The tenders were okay, but boring. The spice level was good and the batter was tasty, but nothing about this meal was memorable. The greens were good and loaded with ham hocks, and the cole slaw tasted freshly made. The iced tea was fresh brewed and refreshing. I don't have many complaints about the food, it was just nothing special. There are far better fried chicken places in town and if I'm going to blow my carb allowance on fried goodness, it's not going to be at Hattie B's.  Prices are high (lunch for three was about $85), and it's cutthroat competition to battle for a seat. But the food is good. This wasn't my favorite fried chicken and I won't be clamoring to return because it was nothing particularly cravable, but I'd eat here again at some point.  Getting here is a pain if you aren't staying on the Strip, making it not locals-friendly. Bummer.",

    "text": "I grew up in a house where my younger brother would seek out the hottest hot sauce and drown his food it. I would sometimes try these wild sauces risking death, but somehow he was able to handle the most intense heats that I could not.  I share this with you, because the place has \"Hot Chicken\" in its name. If you go expecting \"mild chicken\" (which they do have) you're doing it wrong.  Part of the Block 16 chic food court, Hattie B's is one of a few small stands dishing out delicious food. It is not a restaurant, but the idea is you and your drunk friends could grab all kinds of food and still hang out, but instead of a food court with McDonald's an KFC, you get Hattie B's, sushi, sliders, and Cuban sandwiches.  Now having some experience with Nashville hot chicken I can confidently say this is the best Nashville hot chicken I've had and at the fairest of price points.   Chicken was super crispy even after being dunked in the hot sauce, which is where other places fall short. This was the most tender Nashville chicken I've ever had as well. The sandwich was the perfect balance of sauce, heat, crunch, creamy. Balance is the key word, the chicken was still the focal point but everything else complimented it so well.   The sides were all delicious. Because I didn't want to be miserable I got the medium chicken which still had some but not much heat to it. My wife got mild, but it just didn't have enough flavor for me. She liked it, but how do you go to a Nashville hot chicken spot and get mild chicken? If I was out with my boys I would have gone with the hot chicken. I probably could have handled it, but didn't want to risk it mid-date night. Doubt my wife wants to watch my eyes water as I shoved fried chicken into my mouth. Not the vibe for date night.  Service was A+. I hope whoever runs this spot sees this review. I wish I could coach my employees to be as great as service was last night. Friendly smile, efficient and friendly. Answered the one question I had without acting bothered or rushed. They asked for my name once and everyone used it the rest of the process. The girl exposing food caught a minor mistake before my food got to me and they addressed it quickly.  I've lived in Las Vegas for decades and there has been a dearth if affordable food on the strip until recently. There still aren't a lot of options, but it is getting better. Hattie B's comes in clutch only charging $15 for a big chicken sandwich and a side. There are maybe 5-7 places you could get that much food on the strip for under $15. If you're trying to do Vegas on a budget two people could share the sandwich and fries for lunch.   Overall, I thought the food was delicious, the service exceptional, the price more than reasonable. How do I not give it 5 stars?",

    "text": "I love Hattie B's! The way the chicken was served and the flavor kind of reminded me of T22 Chicken Joint in Austin, TX. Similar concept: order your meat with the sides; select the spice level, and then wait for your order.  Unlike T22, which is a full service restaurant, however, Hattie B's is part of The Block 16 Food Court located inside the Cosmopolitan so it's a counter service. Place your order at the cashier and they will call your name when the food's ready.   I ordered the SM White plate and an extra chicken strip along with with seasoned fries and mac n cheese for my sides. I asked for the 'Hot' spiciness and a cup of lemonade. I have to say, it was pretty pricey but I was stoked to try the chicken anyway.  After placing the order, I walked toward the pick up counter which is located on the opposite side of the order counter. All the counter seating next to the pick up counter was available despite the difficulty of finding a place to sit pretty much anywhere else inside Block 16. Not long after I sat down, I heard my friend's name called for his order so I knew that my order was coming up. But what do you know? The girl who was calling out the order looked at the slip and started laughing before going \"BELLY\" and then saying something to one of the guys behind the counter about my name while laughing at it before calling it the second time without realizing that I was walking up toward her. I said \"right here\" and the laughing stopped. I picked up my order and went back to sit down.   Enough with that. Now let's talk about food.  'Hot!' level IS spicy! At least I thought it was spicy. My friend got 'medium' and he thought it was really spicy. The chicken was good and. The spiciness just added to the joy of eating the chicken. The seasoned fries were crispy and flavorful; and the mac n cheese was delightful.  As for hot fried chicken, Hattie B's would be one of the better hot fried chicken joints I've been to. T22 and Gus's would be some other ones you should try.   As for the workers, counter service really doesn't require a whole lot from them. Be friendly for 2 minutes while you're taking the order and answer whatever questions a customer might have and maybe try not to laugh at a customer's name?   Suggestion to management: maybe provide tap water instead of bottled water only. I mean, have you tried the 'hot!' or 'damn hot!' level of your chicken? If you haven't, maybe you should and see how much water you need to cool down your burning tongue. Or, do you really expect the customers to drop money for multiple overpriced bottle water? Because that's messed up if it's True. I know it's a business, but still.   I was tempted to rate this joint a three due to the worker making fun of my name (I wasn't offended but that's still not cool business practice) and the fact that there's no tap water provided. But the chicken is delicious and for counter service, the food is what matters so I'll let those slide.",

Hattie B's is a Nashville style hot chicken place on the second floor of the Cosmpolitan where the smorgasbord style restaurants Are.   My friends and I all ordered different things, one ordered the half chicken, another ordered the sandwich, and I went with the tenders. They use a sweet potato bun with good coleslaw according to my friend who got the sandwich. I ordered my chicken tenders spicy which came with fries and Mac and cheese. The chicken was absolutely delicious! It was spicy but not too spicy to overpower the quality juicy flavor the chicken had. It was mouth watering! The Mac n cheese uses pimento cheese which was by far the best Mac and cheese I've had at a hot chicken place. I will say it's not as good as angry birdz in LA but better than the others.   The only reason it loses a star is because they don't give out cups of water with a meal. You have to buy water which is ridiculous. It's a friggin casino and bar where tons of hammered people sat by us and couldn't get water. WHACK. They serve beer and wine too but no water for the DD's.",

It moved quickly though, ordering was fast and friendly, and my food was ready 10 min after I ordered. I got the 1/2 Bird Plate with the Pimento Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad as my sides. The chicken, y'all, was the most moist friend chicken I have ever had. I got the 'Hot' spice level and it had a decent kick. I would definitely want to try the next two spice levels to see what they're about. My spice tolerance is pretty high just fyi. The chicken definitely steals the show. And the Nashville Comeback Sauce was a tasty addition, with a nice kick as well. The sides I tried were good, nothing out of this world tbh.

(If you're sensitive to spice, I suggest you either stick to the mild heat or order something like potato salad or more coleslaw to cool down the burn).

    "text": "I've been back to this place....probably at least 5-7 times now. Consistent, quick, and delicious every time. To me, there is a big difference between the sandwich and the tenders itself . Don't ask me why and I really don't even know if they use a different cut/flavoring, but the sandwich is miles better than the tenders. The sandwich was so much juicier and for the price of a meal, you get so much food. I always walk away satisfied.  I've noticed that most people writing 3-4 star reviews are talking about the tenders...so maybe I am on to something here?   I always get mild and even the mild is hot enough for me. I guess med and hot is for the adventurous.   My only complaint about this place is that they don't give out water. bottled water is over priced so you will want to buy a sweet tea. But THEN you're still thirsty. IDK. just come w your hydroflask.   I am secretly hoping that less people find out about this place so that the lines stay short.",

I love Nashville hot chicken and this place has 5 or 6 levels of heat ending with Damn Hot and the hottest being Shut the Cluck Up. I of course had to get some Shut the Cluck Up. I also got one chicken tender at Damn Hot hotness. After about 3 bites I knew the heat level was real. It hurt so good. A few more bites in the sweats started and then my nose started running. That's when you know it's good.   The combo plates come with 2 sides. I got mac n cheese and potato salad. The chicken was flavorful and juicy and I loved the heat. My mouth was on fire for about half an hour and I loved it.",

    "text": "No thanks. The hype is not real with this one and I think it's because this place is a transplant.  I had HUGE expectations. I've had a few friends who has tried Hattie B's in Nashville and all of them give high regards. Nashville Hot Chicken is sweeping the nation and back home in Los Angeles, I have a place in town that is killing in. So when I saw that Hattie B's moved into the Cosmo, my curious fried-chicken-loving heart pulsed with joy as I immediately jumped at the opportunity to try it out.   I ordered the SM White medium with an extra tender medium on the side. I picked the Pimento Mac & Cheese and the French Fries for my sides.  My god everything was BLAND, even the comeback sauce cannot save every dish. The chicken breast was dry (didn't seem like it was brined) and the batter lacked crispness (probably was dipped too long before the seasoning went on). The chicken tender wasn't crunchy and lacked seasoning as well. The medium heat level was weak, like weaker than sriracha hot sauce. If you can handle sriracha, go for Hot.   The Pimento Mac & Cheese sparked a glimmer of hope, but after your third bite, you were done with the overcooked pasta and you just want to move on. French Fries... were pretty much french fries. It wasn't tossed in any seasoning and if you didn't order the comeback sauce on the side for the fries, good luck eating plain fries.   There were some positives. The sweet tea, great! Just the right amount of sweetness. The staff is super friendly and I appreciate their patience as they deal with so many confused customers at the register. Overall, service is great, so hats off to everyone working there.   If you stumble upon Hattie B's while you here, JUST SKIP IT. Go to another restaurant in the Cosmo. If you really want Nashville Hot Chicken, then go to Nashville and maybe it would be better over there. If you are a Los Angeleno reading this, stick to Howlin Ray's (even if that line is horrendous), the Nashville Hot Chicken there is WAY WAY better.",

    "text": "I was super down and excited to try this place after all the hype about Hawlin' Ray's over in Los Angeles. I may be the last person left on earth that still hasn't tried it yet.  Anyways, we got the chicken combo set in two heat flavors-- the super spicy and \"what the pluck.\"   I actually prefer the flavor of the \"what the pluck\" over the super spicy. It was quite hot for me though, and I was sweating hard, trying to ration my $5 coke. I mean, I wasn't gonna pay $4 for water so i figured I'd get a soda out of it. Pretty bad move though, cuz that carbonation makes the heat fizzle inside your mouth even more, burning up the walls of your mouth. But I was still gonna get through the abuse cuz I wasn't gonna pay for no water.   Bring your thermos of cold water with you if you're gonna try their \"what the pluck.\" I hear it is equivalent to the medium spicy chicken at Howlin Ray's. Also, no offense, but I don't know if the stinky tofu smell was wafting into my chicken and affecting my taste buds and senses, but the chicken had a slight pungent flavor.  Mac and cheese- 1 star.  Cole slaw- 3.5 stars. But 5 stars for use as a mouth cooler.  Original sauce- BOMB DIGS 5 STARs DELICIOUS . Puts the chick-fil-A OG sauce to shame by 100 points.   I think I'll go back and try the \"What the Pluck\" again, but a mile away from the stinky tofu restaurant. With my icey-cold Hydroflasked agua.",

I like food that has some spice so I got the medium (second level of spicyness). It was perfectly spiced, but I needed a cool drink after! The sides we had were greens and potato salad. I love collard greens so this was great for me and they were savory not sweet (thank the Lord!) My husband had the potato salad and said it was tasty. The line is long but once you order the food comes up suuper quickly! Definitely a little pricey $17 for a sandwich and two sides. Definitely worth the price!!!",

    "text": "Las Vegas is called the Entertainment Capital of the World. I would also call it the Restaurant Capital of the World. I think that many Yelpers would agree. Restaurants throughout the World are placing their pots in this culinary melting pot in the hot Mojave Desert. A recent arrival to the Restaurant Capital of the World is Hattie B's Chicken. Established in 2012 by Nick Bishop Sr. and Nick Bishop Jr., their hot chicken became a Nashville sensation. It grew to over six locations, expanded into Atlanta and very recently outside the Southeast to Las Vegas.    Hattie B's expanded into Las Vegas at the same time as the Food Hall movement took the Las Vegas Strip by storm. Upon its arrival the Eataly and Block 16 opened. Food lovers took to both instantaneously. This food lover would take to Hattie B's a few minutes short of instantaneously.    Last week Yelp led me to Block 16. On Saturday when my brother and I met up at Urth Caffe (in the Wynn), we decided to check out the new Block 16 Food Hall in the Cosmopolitan. Unlike Secret Pizza on level 3, it was easy to find. It is on level 2 which is the same level as the Las Vegas Strip pedestrian bridges. It is in the shadow of the chandelier near the night club and restaurants.    As expected Block 16 was very busy. The crowd ranged from young party goers to senior citizens. It was a mixed crowd that shared a long line. In similar style to its neighboring Block 16 eateries, it is fast-casual. The way it worked was that I ordered off the overhead black and white menu. Off the menu, I chose the chicken size, chicken cuts, type of chicken (dark, white, wings, or tenders), degree of heat, and two sides. Again, their specialty is hot chicken. If I wanted a beverage I could of ordered a Pepsi, bottled water, ice tea, lemonade or beer on tap. Upon ordering, the cashier took my name. From this vintage point, I had a clear view of the kitchen. When I walked to the other side to wait for them to call \"Daniel\", I took in another close up view of the kitchen. I appreciate being able to see what goes on where they make my food. From the clean presentation of the kitchen, I do not expect to be reading any negative \"Eater Vegas\" articles on Hattie B's.    Dissimilar to many food courts, Block 16 was extraordinary busy. Fortunately my brother and I landed nearby chairs nearby.    I ordered the two piece dark breast and wing with potato salad and fries. Coming out to $12.99 after taxes it includes two sides. To be honest, I expected it to be overrated with an underwhelming portion. I expected the portion to be so small to the degree of planning Ghirardelli for dessert. Hattie D's exceeded my expectations. Everything except the toast that I passed over was wonderfully appetizing. Every bite from the hot crusty chicken skin to the potato salad was excellence. The hot level seemed to be as hot as a Las Vegas sidewalk on an August afternoon. It was a generous portion of abundance that left me full. The one drawback was the beverage selection and prices. I was not up for a beer. They wanted $5 for a Pepsi. I was like, \"Me thinks not.\" This food adventure marks the first time in years that I passed over drinking a beverage with my meal.    In the Restaurant Capital of the World, Hattie B's puts on a stellar culinary performance cooking Nashville Hot Chicken. To the time of writing this review, it is one of if not the best fried chicken that I have had on the Las Vegas Strip.",

My gf and I each had a meal (sandwich for me, tenders for her), a drink, and share a dessert, for the total of over $70.  Fast casual food should not cost this much.  Screw that.

    "text": "Hattie B's is located inside the new Block 16 food hall inside Cosmo on the 2nd level next to Marquee, Holsteins, and China Poblano. Unfortunately did not live up to the hype for us. The one major positive I would say is the pricing of the food - downright reasonable for a casino food hall. We ordered a hot chicken sandwich (medium spice level) which was $12 and comes with a side (we choose fries but other options include cole slaw, collard greens, etc.). We also ordered a large dark (damn hot) which comes with two additional sides for $14. While the chicken was very moist, it was unfortunately very salty, which greatly detracted from the overall flavor. The medium wasn't terribly spicy, and neither was the damn hot imho. In contrast to the food, the drinks were ridiculously overpriced. The tea was $5 and doesn't even include refills. Also, they don't have cups of water, just bottled water available for purchase (a little mean if you are selling really spicy food imo). Being from SoCal, id rate Dave's and Howlin Rays as significantly better than Hattie Bs. If you're in the mood for hot chicken and are at Cosmo,this will satisfy your fix - otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

    "text": "This place was busy!!! The Cosmopolitan is very busy, so be mindful of traffic and parking before you even enter the restaurant. The restaurant was located on the second floor, and you have to navigate through the sea of smokers to arrive at the restaurant (this is information only - this doesn't impact my review)... On to the food...  The chicken was good - I went with the hot. I believe the spice is oil based, so it will have a bit of texture impact on the chicken. Mines wasn't soggy - still rather crispy even with the additional spice added to it. I thought the heat index was good. As others mentioned I was somewhat disappointed in the pricing. I live here - I get it, its Vegas, and you are on the strip, but we paid $20 just for 4 lemonades!  I thought that was a bit much. So when you consider value vs taste, overall I think the place is average - hence my 3 star review.",

    "text": "Cosmopolitan upped their game with Hattie B's Hot Chicken. Finally - Great Nashville hot chicken in Vegas!  Chicken was flavorful - crispy, spicy and delicious. Tried the leg/thigh quarter (medium spicy), tenders (hot spicy), southern greens and pimento mac and cheese. The chicken was juicy without being oily. The spice level between medium and hot was not dramatically different. Very reasonably priced, fast and no line either!   4 stars because although Hattie B is awesome... Howlin Rays (in Los Angeles) is better. Hattie B is the closest to Howlin Rays (I've tried so far). Howlin Rays has higher quality chicken, tons of flavor, more spice levels and is less salty. Note: Howlin Rays' \"hot\" spice level is much hotter then Hattie B's \"hot.\"  While in Vegas, try Hattie B - it's definitely worth it and you don't have to wait in Howlin Rays' infamous 2+ hour line for grub.",

I also decided to try their banana pudding for dessert, but it was just OK. When I first got there, the place was empty but filled up quickly.   Overall, I give this place 5 stars!

I like it because howling Ray is so seasoned it is so salty I cannot eat it anymore. It also is so big it falls apart after the first part.

We went with their Mac and cheese which was delicious and they were generous with the crinkle cut fries. I would recommend mild if you have a low tolerance for spicy food. We chose medium for are spice level and that had a good kick. I ordered a single chicken tender for $3 to try their hottest spice level \"damn hot\". Tasted 5x hotter than their medium and left a numbing sensation around the lips which lingered around for several minutes. Their blue cheese dips helps Noneify the heat a bit. Our meal for two totaled about $22 which is cheap compared to many other options in vacation. Was at the Bacchanal weekend buffet the night before $140 for two. Half the buffet was mediocre. Will definitely swing by this hot chicken joint the next time I visit Vegas.",

I heard it's similar to Lowlin Rays in LA. Located at the Cosmopolitan hotel on the strip. They have different chicken plates combo and chicken sandwich here.   l My Order l  Small White ($10) - Breast/wing quarter, served with two sides, bread and pickles. For sides, you have the option between southern greens, cut fries, mac & cheese, coleslaw, red skin potato salad, and a la carte side. For my sides, I got the coleslaw and mac & cheese. Heat levels: mild, medium, hot and damn hot! I just went with mild. For my dipping sauce, I got honey mustard, it's bomb!   l Thoughts on Food l  This was such a great deal for the price I paid! Portions were good for that amount. I like how the sides were included in the combo! I had a large piece of chicken fried to perfection. The chicken skin was crunchy and the meat was tender. The sides paired well with the chicken combo.   l Service l  The food came out pretty quick right after we ordered. However, when I went to pick up an extra sauce, this girl who worked there stared at me and said \"What do you need?!\" with attitude. She made it seemed as if I wasn't allowed to pick up an extra sauce, which was pretty rude!   But other than that, my friends and I really enjoyed Hattie B's and thought it was a good price for the food. I would come back again when I'm at Cosmo!",

Went with Damn Hot level of spice.  I thought they might tone it down a bit for the non-Nashville location but it sure didn't seem like it.  Mac & cheese was excellent, really creamy.  Collard greens were cooked enough but didn't get much of a ham hock or vinegary taste.  All in all you get 3 large tenders and 2 sides for $11.  In Vegas, that is a steal!

The chicken is not made-to-order so it moves very quickly since they already have pre-made/fried chicken pieces ready. We ordered the hot chicken sandwich with pimento mac and cheese and crinkle cut fries as our sides.  We got spicy level \"hot\" and it was decently spicy. If you can handle your spice, I recommend getting \"hot\" or maybe even \"damn hot.\" The sandwich comes with a cut of chicken breast drizzled with hot spices, cole slaw, a generous amount of pickles, and their Nashville comeback sauce which is like a thousand island type sauce. The chicken is super juicy and the sauce complements it really well. I like how there was a good balance between spicy and savory.  The pimento mac and cheese was super cheesey and really good. I really liked the peppers in it, it gave it a tiny kick of spice. Definitely above average mac and cheese. The crinkle cut fries were average, they came with to-go sides of ketchup but very little.  Overall, I really liked the chicken sandwich and mac and cheese! Its a pretty fair price for hot chicken and food in Vegas. Very similar to Howlin' Rays in Los Angeles, CA but different in a good way.",

The fried chicken skin is so crispy, the meat is moist, and the Medium spicy level is perfect for someone wanting just a little heat. And those FRIES. Crinkle cut fries here are as good as it gets. The mac n cheese is thick, creamy and you can pick up on the bits of pimento. The potato chunks in the potato salad keep their shape. No over-mixing here. It's extremely cooling when eaten with the chicken. Just get everything!!  I did prefer the chicken alone versus the sandwich. The fried chicken stand alone is too good to hide within bread.   I didn't think the Nashville Comeback Sauce was necessary for an extra $3. It basically tasted like mayo and seasoning. Probably great and more suitable for the hottest spicy level.

    "text": "A shadow of its Nashville brothers...   Hot barely tickled. The chicken tasted unseasoned except for a sprinkle of cayenne. I was hoping to relive my Nashville wonderment but the chicken was sorely lacking in taste and heat. The cook on the chicken was ok, crispy but overdone (I pulled on the drumstick and the bone came out while the meat was still attached to the thigh). The fries tasted old too, barely a crisp, warmed only by the lamp. Maybe I shouldn't be ordering fried chicken with fries at 10pm and expect everything to taste fresh... Is my bad experience due to inconsistencies in the kitchen? Unlikely since all chicken is flavored using the same hot pepper and oil for a given heat level.  Hattie B's is hands down my favorite fried chicken even when compared to Willie Mae's from Nola. Unfortunately, the Vegas branch just didn't make the cut.",

Great Location - 2nd level of contemporary Cosmopolitan   Wait Time - Approximately 15 minutes total (including time waiting in line and waiting for food to be prepared)  Food - My \"hot\" jumbo tenders were amazing.  My sides were decent (Mac & cheese & collard greens)  Price - Reasonable Prices  Hattie B's even sells bottled Fiji water (woot woot).  Service - Pleasant   I've been talking about this chicken since returning to Atlanta.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn we have a location in Atlanta  I'll be visiting REAL SOON.",

    "text": "I was surprisingly disappointed. Being a southerner and fried chicken expert I was really expecting this chicken to be amazing. Firstly because the lines are always wrapped around the corner and secondly because the prices are so high. $20 for half a chicken!?! Anyways I chose that southern flavor because we don't really like spicy food and it was just ok. Not really better than Publix chicken. The service was kind and polite especially with all of the pressure of long lines but it still wasn't worth the money. I had the collard greens that needed more seasoning and hot sauces and the macaroni was really different... not sure why there was pimento I'm there. I didn't either more than two bites of either. Bottom line is I will not recommend or return to this restaurant. Follow me on instagram sweet_maloy. Thank you.",

    "text": "Great price point and portions! Quick tips:  1. Hattie B's is located across from Holstein's burger and Poblanos.  2. Each plate is served with two sides.  3. The hottest sauce--shut the cluck up--is made with ghost peppers and the damn hot sauce is made with habaneros.  After checking into Cosmo this past Wednesday, I walked past the urban food hall and saw that they were putting the final touches on the construction. The next night they had a soft opening for workers and they opened today!  When we arrived around 10:45, there was already a short line forming up. If you've ever been to Howling Rays in LA, then you know that there's the definite wait. However, on the plus side the wait was very manageable.  The food was very reasonably priced. I recommend getting a plate so you can try some sides too. You can get a large dark meat plate (2 legs and 2 thighs) for $14. The large white meat plate is $15 (breast and wing). They also have a half chicken plate for $17. You get to choose your spice level from mild, medium, hot, \"damn that's hot,\" and \"shut the cluck up.\"  The damn that's hot is made with habanero peppers and the shut the cluck up is made with ghost peppers. You should be careful with the heat and not let yourself get too carried away!! We chose the mild and the damn that's hot.  There are several sides which include collared greens, fries, coleslaw, and fries. We chose the crinkle cut fries and the pimento Mac and cheese. The chicken came on two pieces of toast to suck up the hot sauce.  The chicken was well cooked and very juicy on the inside. The skin was crispy, but seemed a little over done and a bit hard. The chicken though was very big and very nicely seasoned throughout. The damn that's hot lived up to its heat. It was face meltingly hot. According to my wife the mild was still too spicy for her. Thankfully, the inside of the chicken was not spicy but at all for my wife.  The fries were very dense and cut fat. The portion was very generous and the fries were seasoned slightly. The Mac and cheese was a big miss, we barely tasted the pimento and it reminded me more of a regular Mac and cheese you could make yourself. Not as innovative.  Overall, the price point makes this such a great deal especially in Vegas! I would definitely come again to get more next time. Hope you all have a chance to visit :)  Edit:  I forgot to add, there was one part of the service we weren't so thrilled about with the large pack comes a choice of sauce from blue cheese to ranch to honey mustard (highly recommended) and Nashville's comeback sauce. We love honey mustard so we got that and we also asked about the Nashville's comeback sauce too.   The thing is apparently a sauce is $3.00, and our order taker definitely didn't let us know when we picked two sauces. If the menu said that each dipping sauce was $3.00 we would have definitely ordered only one. If you're going to charge $3.00 for a sauce, you should really let people know that an extra dipping sauce costs that much. The sauce is in this small container, which would hardly be worth that much.",

Sides ...mac n cheese x 2/coleslaw/potato salad.   kids shared the tenders (and we tasted it)...even with no heat...it was still very flavorful and moist.   we shared the white meat...spicy...OMG was it spicy! loved it (there is a step up that I hesitate to try...but i know i will next time). mac n cheese was delish!  there was a line but it moved pretty quickly ....pickup wasn't too long of a wait. Decent amount of seating (but we took it back to room)  yup...solid food....that being said...i've never been to the original locations...but this made me happy",

    "text": "Hot Chicken indeed! I've heard of Hattie's after watching them show up on the TV cheering on for their Nashville fried chicken. This location is just opened a couple days ago in the Cosmo food court and I'm so happy it was the weekend I was in town. Even though it's new the wait was manageable. We came 10:45ish and there was already a line, but it went by fairly quickly.   I opted for the 2 piece dark meat chicken combo plate (medium) for ~$14. My oh my was this chicken good. The order we got had two large pieces of chicken - enough to share between 2+ people in my opinion. The skin was perfectly crispy and after the first bite I definitely felt the heat because it was seasoned really well. The chicken meat was moist and fall off the bone as well. I love how they pair it with white bread as a nice palette cleanser between each bite. Wish they gave more than 2 slices though. haha. We also ended up getting the mac n cheese & french fries for the side and they help balance the heat. The mac & cheese was nice and cheesy but not overkill with the pimento cheese. The french fries were crinkle cut and honestly you can't go wrong with potatoes.   Hattie's is in the food court so seating is self-serve/first-come so be sure you come early to grab a seat to dive into your meal.",

    "text": "Discovered this place via Instagram so I had to run there as fast as I could to try it out! It's located in the small food district of the cosmopolitan. I ordered the small dark plate combo for $10-11. Perfect amount for one person! It comes with a leg/thigh piece and you choose your spice level. I chose medium because I'm a wimp, but it goes up to 5 levels. Shut the cluck up is the spiciest and it's made with ghost pepper and habanero. I also ordered a banana pudding which was $6. Total price for everything came out to $17 which isn't bad at all for being on the strip. I got my food to go because I wasn't sure if there would be any seats available because it gets fairly packed.   The chicken was VERY good. It was seasoned so well and the spice level was enough for me. The plate came with two sides so I got coleslaw and pimento mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese brought on the heat as well but super good. The Cole Slaw was just there. It wasnt bad and it wasn't fantastic. The meal also comes with a slice of bread and two pickles.  The banana pudding was amazing! The crunch of the vanilla wafers were the best part.  I'm definitely coming back and I want to go up a notch on the spice level. If you like southern food then definitely try this place out! It's great comfort food and you get your moneys worth.",

I was in the cosmopolitan hotel looking for a quick bite and I noticed the long for Hattie B's was wrapped around the corner in the block 16. I knew it had to be good, I waited about 30 minutes and it was so worth the wait.  The portion sizes are amazing the two piece was my breakfast the next day. The sauce they dip the chicken into is just out of this world, simply incredible and the comeback sauce takes it to the next level. You can choose from southern, medium, hot, or damn hot. My mouth is watering writing this review. The chicken is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside severed over a slice of bread that soaks up some of the sauce.    I wanted to try the greens but couldn't because they contained pork. Instead I had the cole slaw and the pimento Mac and cheese. I enjoyed the cole slaw but I do not recommend the Mac and cheese. To me the Mac and cheese lacked texture. I also tired the banana pudding, the banana pudding was okay to me again I felt it lacked textured and layers banana pudding typically has.   Overall Hattie B's is worth the price and the wait. You definitely get your money's worth.",

I didn't like the breading, the chicken wasn't really juicy and the flavor was not there. I have gone to Howlin' Rays and Dave's Hot Chicken 50+ times so this is a fair comparison. Maybe it was a bad batch for that particular day but there is zero comparison to be made. The french fries were good however, but that's really the last thing that comes to mind when you come to a hot chicken joint.",

Once you take the first bite you will notice that the chicken is very moist and juicy. I got a side of the super spicy sauce to drizzle on my hot flavored chicken and it gave it the kick I needed.

We got the medium flavor on a half chicken and a single tender. Service was good but the three stars are based on the fact that the chicken was not that good. Once you eat the spicy skin from the chicken.  The meat itself wasn't seasoned and was pretty bland. To confirm this I went back a second day and ordered a dark plate. It was the same taste the second time. Three stars are based on good service and nice people. Good macaroni and cheese but bland chicken once passed the skin.",

    "text": "Nashville hot chicken favorite Hattie B's now has a location inside the fantastic Cosmopolitan resort in Las Vegas. I have never been able to try this restaurant in Nashville because of incredibly long lines and was thrilled to only wait in a very short one to dine there in Las Vegas. I was incredibly pleased with the final product. I opted for the jumbo tenders.  The tenders were huge, much larger than those offered by other hot chicken restaurants I have visited. The hot chicken flavor was impeccable. On a future visit, I would like to move up a heat level. I opted for a conservative approach for my first visit in the hopes of not ruining my entire day. Sides were very conventional, but extremely well prepared. The fries were of the crinkle cut variety, but we're so well-seasoned that they stood out. The macaroni and cheese was similarly extremely creamy and perhaps best of all, prices were reasonable by any standard, and incredibly reasonable by Las Vegas standards. This is a must visit for me on any future trips to Las Vegas.",

We got french fries and the pimento mac n cheese. It was a ton of food! Perfect for sharing. I like a good amount of heat but not overpowering the flavor, so we went with medium heat and that was just right. The skin was the best. Tons flavor and crispy. I could eat a bowl of that skin. The chicken was on top of the toast. Some might be mad about that, but the toast soaked up juices from the chicken and made the toast even better.",

I'm sure the one is Nashville is better but the one in Vegas delivers.  The compact size doesn't effect the taste.  It's good and worth the minimal 15 minute wait for your order.    I got the sandwich which was on point flavor wise, crunchy and very filling. I just went medium spice level which wasn't hot at all.  The chicken also wasn't very oily like other hot chicken places.  So the flavor was a little less pronounced.  I ordered two chicken tenders on the side and they were good.  However over kill because i was full after the sandwich. The crinkle fries were also excellent and they give a lot of them!  I'm from LA and I know Howling Rays and Dave's hot chicken doesn't have roots in Nashville but I believe their recipe is better.  However, the 5 minute wait was much better the 30-45 minute wait at Howling it Dave's.",

In 2017, Hattie B's was ranked sixth on The Daily Meal's list of America's 75 Best Fried Chicken Spots but this place caught my eye while watching Ugly Delicious so tada! Here we are!     Shared a Small Dark Plate [leg and thigh quarter] at mild spice with some Southern Greens and Pimento Mac & Cheese. I also got a side of the Nashville Comeback Sauce and some ranch just in case things got a little spicy. Oh man, if we weren't trying to save our stomachs for dinner, we would have ordered more. It was SO good.   The chicken was amazingly crispy. Don't be one of those types that passes on the chicken skin to be healthy. You're eating lard-fried chicken that is drenched in spicy oil, okay? The meat itself was juicy and the flavor was spot on. At mild spice, it was more than easily manageable. I think I should have gotten it medium spicy but I wasn't sure how spicy hot chicken gets and I wasn't tryna ruin my Vegas trip with my first meal of the day. The mac & cheese was creamy and basic. If I hadn't forgotten my Lactaid, I would have destroyed this side dish. The greens were stewed to perfection, although I bit more bitter than I'm accustomed to. We washed everything down with some sweetened iced teas.   All in all, I'm hot for that Nashville hot chicken! Burn me up, baby!",

My favorite chicken spot is Howlin' Rayes in Los Angelos which is also from Nashville so I wanted to see how Hattie B's compared. Hattie B's did not disappoint! I can handle spice way more than the average person. The 'hot' was not hot to me. The 'damn hot' was just right for me. I think the hottest one would have had me crying. I wish I had tried it but I was so full off of the plate already.   This is definitely a must try when in Vegas!",

It was ranked top 10 fried chicken in 2017 in their Nashville location. I am a fried chicken lover and try it anywhere it's offered.   I opted for the tender plate, with fries and pimiento mac & cheese. For the spice level, I was told by the cashier that mild was pretty spicy. This was spicy enough for me!  Mac & cheese was very unique with the pimiento cheese. Not the usual I'm used to but it was good! The fries were a bit stale and very salty. I went late at night so that could be why. Now for the chicken. Not the best fried chicken and I have never been to the Nashville location so I can't compare. Chicken was a little salty, not as crispy as I like but all in all it was great and prices were fair. Plates are served with your choice of sauce, a piece of white toast and a few pickle slices. Iced tea's are bottomless!",

It was fried to perfection with the crispy crust and the flavors were beyond delicious with the right amount of heat (a range of choose from), the fragrant spices and the wonderful sauces.  So seeing Hattie B's at Vegas was like a dream come True. I ordered the small dark, which consists of the leg and thigh, with the collard greens and the red potato salad.  The interesting part about my meal was that both the collard greens and potato salad were absolutely tasty. As for the chicken, I was a bit disappointed. It just did not taste the same as what I had remembered back in Nashville. The crust was also very thick and a bit overcooked. Something was definitely off.",

The first couple of times, I ordered the small plates. That was too much for me, so I can't imagine what a large would do. Those are fabulous options to share between 2-4 people!  This time, we ordered a chicken sandwich with two tenders. It's a good option considering the tenders are large and the fry portion is also sharable. The spices are always adequate. I don't go above medium hot, though.   Cleanliness is always 5/5 stars. The upkeep is always reassuring.  They're open late! 5/5 stars from the night owls! The service provided by the staff either nonchalant or very friendly. I'm happy with it.   The only thing that is off-putting are the prices, 4/5. They're \"strip\" prices. I'm always deterred from purchasing their slushy beverages because it gets so expensive between parking and buying food.",

    "text": "Wolfed down some fried chicken before heading over to Jay Chou's concert!  Allen and I came here on a Saturday around 8:15 pm, and we waited about 10 minutes before we got our food.   Pro tip 1: get an iced tea! You get unlimited refills! (ie: $5 bottle of Fiji water or endless amounts of tea?!)   Pro tip 2: Allen can handle pretty spicy food, but the cashier told us that \"shut the cluck up\" is too hardcore. He went down a level, and said it wasn't spicy enough. For me (someone who can barely tolerate spicy), would advise getting the lowest level of spice to flavor up the chicken a bit.   Pro tip 3: Allen and I can eat a decent amount, but after we each got a plate...it was way too much food! Would recommend splitting a plate, and then adding more chicken as needed.   We both ended up ordering platters. The menu is simple: type of chicken (white/dark, which part, and in which form) and you can just add on stuff after (ie: sides).   We ended up trying: 1) Plate: SM White ($12) x 2 // +/-1 You get a dipping sauce for free with each order! Each additional one is 50 cent more.   +1 Huge portion size! But.... -1 Chicken too dry, and  -1 The batter was flavorless unless you add some sauce to it.   2) Sides: Crinkle cut fries, pimento mac n cheese, creamy cole slaw, and red skin potato salad ($4 is the original price) // +1 Would recommend getting fries and mac n cheese. +/-1 Everything else was okay!  3) Iced tea (sweetened) // Yum! If anything, I'd probably mix it with some unsweetened, since it did get a bit sickening after 2 cups.   Service: great! Seating: a decent amount in the plaza! It was somewhat prime dinner time, so you might not be able to find a table if you come with a big party.   Overall, giving this 3.75 to a 4 because of value and service! I look forward to trying the OG one day!",

    "text": "While Block 16 Urban Food Hall currently contains five individual concepts that will eventually grow to six it would be impossible to argue any was more anticipated than Hattie B's Hot Chicken, the Nashville concept from a father and son team that has been burning up locals and tourists near Vanderbilt since 2012.  Originally visited in May 2015 and at that time already sprouting a second location despite fierce competition from nearby Gus' and Prince's, the more convenient location and classier environs of Hattie B's no doubt part of an appeal that often spawns 2+ hour lines, it is partially hidden behind District: Donuts. Sliders. Brew. that guests will notice cursive red neon signage, though in reality as of day two the line forming by 10:30 in anticipation of an 11am opening should be all anyone need see to find the place.  More focused than the original and slightly inconvenienced by a lengthy queue that runs parallel to that of District, the combination making Hattie's counter seating quite uncomfortable and thus overflowing guests to other parts of Block 16, it is after slowly progressing to the register that orders are placed with an average check for one well below $20 including two sides, Bread and Pickles.  Offering five spice levels, several Sauces plus Banana Pudding and Boozy Slushies in addition to the fried Bird and Sides it was with two 1/4 servings plus three Sides at a cost of just $21.70 that two diners dug in, the southern-style Breast and Wing possessing good crunch and complex aromatics that penetrate deep while Medium Leg and Thigh were expectedly more juicy and tangy rather than 'spicy.'  Recalling that even \"Hot\" was not particularly traumatizing in Nashville, a situation most certainly not the case at Los Angeles' Howlin' Rays where many visitors in line will likely draw their comparisons, it was with Bones picked clean that attention turned to Mac n' Cheese given a kick by Pimento as well as creamy Cole Slaw and Collards, the latter offering a rich porky sapor not commonly found outside the South and definitely worth checking out for both fans and those unfamiliar.  FOUR STARS:  Even when originally tasted not quite as intense as Prince's, and now likely to become a direct comparison for Angelinos who've braved Johnny Ray Zone's line, Hattie B's nonetheless offers top quality Chicken served in a manner rarely tasted in the 702, though with many Restaurants including Slater's 50/50 and SkinnyFATS recently adding versions to their menu the competition certainly seems to be warming up.",

    "text": "Not bad hot chicken, but I've definitely had better (Shout our Howlin' Rays in LA!!)   The chicken itself was good and the spice definitely builds so take that into account (we got the sandwich with the second to highest level of spice.)  Couldn't really get any flavor from the cole slaw and sauce though so that was disappointing. Sandwiches also come with a side so we got the pimiento Mac and cheese. Again, couldn't really get pimiento flavor in it, but still delicious Mac and cheese. Wouldn't mind hitting it up tho if I'm in the mood for chicken - servers were nice and not much of a wait!",

    "text": "Welcome to one of the gems of Block 16.  Let me cut straight to the chase, we ordered the small white plate (damn hot) with Mac and cheese and fries.   The chicken was spicy but not too spicy. I actually wish I could get a little bit of sauce on the side for dipping the pieces. The seasoning definitely has a bit of sweetness to it. The chicken is moist and flavorful.  The fries are typically frozen fries. They are super salty, which I appreciated.  The Mac and cheese is great. It's super rich and like a good southern Mac should be.  The bread under the chicken is amazing once it soaks up all the flavors.  The price is really great. For a meal on the strip, you can't beat it.",

It was exactly the same! And a 5 min wait!!!!! So happy to enjoy their food on a second vacation! You must get the lemonaid - it's homemade. And if you normally get mild make sure you get hot, it's more mild with a hint of flavor. Otherwise you get flavor with no \"hot\" at all.",

This is my first time trying Hatties and it did not disappoint.  I order their chicken sandwich mild with a side of Mac and Cheese.  $12 for a chicken sandwich is a bit much but I understand this is Vegas and the strip premium.    The chicken sandwich was full of flavor on each bite.  The sandwich consist of their a fried breaded chicken breast with slaw and pickle between two buns.  The Mac and cheese was also really good.  Plenty of seating.  Hattie's is located in Cosmopolitan.  Recommended!",

The collard greens were fine, but nothing too special. Definitely try the Nashville comeback sauce. Overall, the value is not bad for the Strip.",

    "text": "A friend of mine recently had the pleasure of eating at Hattie B's in Tennessee and told us about how great it was. We figured we'd get to it some day on a foodie adventure, but later that day we discovered that there was a Hattie B's in Cosmo and it JUST opened. Naturally we decided to go see what it was all about.  Hattie B's is located on the 2nd story, the same floor as the entrance to Marquee. My girlfriend and I haven't been to Cosmo in awhile, so when we arrived, we noticed they had turned the 2nd floor into sort of a dining hall (Block 16), or sort of like a mini Anaheim Packing District for those of you who are familiar.  We ordered a large dark plate which is 2 leg/thigh quarters and your choice of 2 sides. A Nashville hot chicken visit wouldn't be complete without a sandwich, so I ordered a sandwich with their SPICIEST level: Shut The Cluck Up.  The cashier warned me that their STCU spice level is comprised of habanero and ghost pepper seasoning/spice. I decided to proceed with my decision, hopefully something I wouldn't regret later if you know what I mean.  After a few pics, we dived right into our food, but more importantly, my sandwich.  Shut The Cluck Up is absolutely spicy for your casual spicy eater. In fact, when I eat something that's REALLY spicy, I start to hiccup almost immediately. I *almost* hiccuped, but it didn't happen. The spice started off pretty aggressively and the heat began to climb, but it never really got to a point where it was unbearable. I was able to finish my sandwich without any discomfort. If you enjoy spicy, I'd say STCU would be a safe/comfortable option.  We ordered our wings in the 2nd highest spice level and it was perfect. The skin and breading was the perfect amount of crispiness and flavor. The meat itself still full of juices and flavor.  Aside from the spice level of my sandwich, the sandwich itself was really good. A good, manageable sandwich size with cole slaw and comeback sauce. Overall something you definitely want to order. It comes with a side as well.  Speaking of sides, their potato salad was pretty mediocre. It's a little on the bland side, but some might like it that way considering how Nashville hot chicken is packed with flavor and plenty of heat. It'd be a good way to cool off your taste buds if need be. Their mac and cheese though was pretty good. Slightly on the runny side, but still good.  If you're not heading out to Nashville any time soon, I'd say Hattie B's in Vegas would be a good place to start. It's pretty filling, full of flavor/heat, and the portions are reasonable for the price.",

I had the fried chicken and chicken tender with collard greens, fries, and coke slaw. I loved the chicken, thought the slaw was just ok (slightly bland), and really didn't like the greens. But I won't dock for that since there are other sides to select. Chicken can come in varying spice levels. The crust was crispy and meat tender and juicy. So good!  Price: Very reasonable for Las Vegas. Perhaps $14/person.  Location: If you're on the strip around Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, etc, then very convenient.  Food: Super good fried chicken.    I'd visit here again.",

There were about 10 people in front of me but the line went by pretty fast.   I got the sandwich and small dark medium hot (comes with leg & thigh) with fries, mac & cheese, and coleslaw.  This was enough to feed 3 people.  The spice level wasn't bad. It's not too spicy but it does have a kick! Everything was good. The only complaint I have is that they should give you one free sauce instead of charging you!   NOTE: They don't have cups of water only bottles for sale. This might be a Vegas thing ...",

I got my Chicken Medium on the Spice which was still pretty spicy and had sides of Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad. All very good. The white toast under the Chicken is a nice touch as well as the sauces on the side. I didn't have the crinkle fries but next time as they looked good. I highly recommend this place as the price is right as well as you get a lot for the money. To cool down you can get a fresh donut from the New Orleans bakery next to it. Also very good.",

It was slightly under cooked and full sodium. My wife and i couldn't even finish after the first couple of bites it was so salty. My blood pressure registered stroke levels. What chicken place does not offer bbq dipping sauce??. That should have been a deal breaker from the start.   Kfc chicken tastes better and thats bad chicken. Cane's I'm sorry i betrayed you. You will always be the best chicken! Hattie B's killer chicken, literally.",

I love how it is conveniently located in Block 16- a high end mini food court.  I had forgotten how much food Hattie B's gives.  I got 4 chicken tenders, macaroni, fries, and a slice of bread drizzled in hot sauce.  Definitely saved some of the chicken for later!  Hattie B's is loved in Nashville- you must try it in Vegas!",

The chicken was juicy and flavorful with crispy batter. The Mac and cheese was super rich and enjoyable. I knocked off a star because the ordering process was a bit chaotic and the line was super slow. At one point, the line did not move at all for almost 10 minutes. They forgot my husband's side of fries, and the seating is sparse and pretty uncomfortable. Also the \"side\" of coleslaw that came with my chicken was seriously about 3 tablespoons worth of slaw... so tiny it was almost funny! A word of advice, the \"medium\" hot was pretty spicy. I like spicy food, but I'm glad I started with medium hot - it had my nose watering and my lips tingling for half an hour afterwards. They offer a range from no spice at all to the super hot. I will be back!",

Of course I had to try shut the cluck up, the the one below it and below that one. Didn't try mild or medium. Had a side of potato salad and fries. Let me tell you the chicken was so juicy and good. The salad was very tasty and the fries were awesome. Now I love spicy things. Shut the cluck up is super duper spicy. Had me sweating up a storm. Again, it was super duper spicy lol. The 2nd time we had lunch there was our last day in Vegas/cosmo. I opted for the chicken sandwich, OH MY GAWD it was super delicious!!! The chicken was so juicy and the piece was huge!! This time I opted for the medium level heat and it was perfect. If you're in Vegas you must try this place. If you like hot please try the shut the cluck up it will not disappoint",

The same can be said for the Cole slaw. The potato salad was decent and had a creamy texture with some flavor, but it wasn't  enough to make this meal stand out. For restaurant prices, this place felt more like a fast food establishment with how little service there is. Lastly, the sweet tea is $5 for a small cup and tastes the same as other places serve it.

The chicken was a dry but good seasoning. The mac and cheese had no flavor to it at all. The sweet tea is the best. It nice and refreshing, just keep in mind its about one cup for five dollars and no refills. If your going to have super hot chicken give out free water and refills. I get that in Vegas you need to have the mindset of spending a lot. They wouldn't even hand out water cups. So rather buying a five dollar small fiji water go down stairs and get a free trenta water cup from Starbucks. Service is great, the ladies up front have a great hospitality.

We got the \"hot\" chicken and it was incredible, perfect spice! Wasn't a huge fan of the greens, they tasted a tad bitter to me, could have used some hot sauce, but they did have ham/bacon. The banana pudding is a MUST by far the best I've ever had. Looking forward to coming back to HattieB's.  Like I said the portions are huge, we only finished half!",

Anyway in comparison to Howlin Rays the chicken was as flavorful. The heat at Hattie B's comes at the end so it sneaks up a little. If I go back I'll try a hotter level and see if that makes a difference but won't be anytime soon because it was disappointing.",

In fact, I believe that was the best fried chicken I ever had.  The chicken is served in mild, medium, hot!, and damn hot! versions. I chose the hot! version. It was decently hot, but nowhere near distressingly hot. The coating was crispy, but the dark meat was perfectly cooked. One thing unique to Hattie's is that after the chicken parts are fried, they are basted with lard containing cayenne and other seasonings. I can't argue with the results of that technique.  The collard greens were nothing special, but they did their job in making me feel less guilty of eating fried chicken, with lard no less. The crinkle cut fries were decent. A hidden find was a slice of bread that was found directly underneath my chicken, which soaked up some of the grease and flavoring.",

My boyfriend got fried chicken sandwich in spicy and I got leg quarter in medium. The meat was juicy and tender which is a crucial factor when it comes to fried chicken. I got the medium which honestly wasn't that spicy. Definitely level up if you like spicy food!",

They don't give out water, you have to buy a bottle ... so we decided to drown the spiciness with Modelo and Moet.  The fried chicken is good but definitely not one of the best.

I'm not a fan of spicy food at all, but you can get your chicken at a mild ('touch of heat') level here.  I opted for the 3 jumbo chicken tenders plate with 2 sides: pimento mac n cheese and red skin potato salad plus a lemonade.  The plate combo is $11 and not a bad price for a Strip establishment.  I really enjoyed the tenders served on top of a slice of white bread; they weren't dry at all and the heat level was just enough for me.  You can get one sauce to accompany your chicken.  I chose the honey mustard and I found the meal to be very satisfying.  The pimento mac n cheese is quite wonderful!  My friends ordered the banana pudding which is not something that I would normally get for myself but the version here turned me around, it's that good.  It's served with Nilla Wafers and is chockfull of banana slices, plus more crushed up wafers on top:  amazing! I would brave the Strip again for a meal here.",

I typically order the tenders, and they're huge, I always have some leftover for another meal. The entire block 16 area is cute and you order up front and find your own table to dine at.   The pricing is great, considering the strip location. Each meal is about $12. This is my go to spot anytime after a concert or show here!",

I got the tender plate with \"medium\" sauce and it was still pretty spicy! I was debating on getting the \"hot\" but I am so glad I didn't! The tender plate comes with 3 tenders (more than enough as they are huge), 2 sides (I got French fries and Mac n cheese), and a dipping sauce (I got ranch). The tenders were delicious and so big I only ate 2. French fries were cooked to perfection and had a yummy seasoning. Mac n cheese had pimento in it and was nice and creamy. My husband got the plate with dark meat (he had one \"damn hot\" and \"hot\"), 2 sides (greens and potato salad -both good), and ranch. I would say maybe the \"damn hot\" was too hot and not really enjoyable for my husband (I didn't try it) as he was tearing up and sweating due to the flavor lol. He took off some of the skin/breading and it was more tolerable.  Hattie B's is located in the cosmopolitan in a little food court area. There is open seating and we had no problems finding a seat.  Overall, I would come back again!",

Chicken was over cooked, no flavor at all and nit even a little spice . I am from California where we have Howling Rays Nashville Hot Chicken. Which is 10 times better than Hattie's.

That still says a lot about the quality and overall delicious meal you'll enjoy at Hattie B's!   The line was about 10 minutes for us but we came at an awkward hour so expect up to a 20-30 minute line. Sandwiches took about 15 minutes thereafter to be brought out.  Wow, this is a damn good sandwich! The chicken is a thicc boy with a golden, crunchy skin and the veggies compliment the chicken perfectly. My only complaint is that for \"hot chicken,\" there's hardly much flavor on the crispy outside. While your mouth will burst (probably into flames) with flavor at Howlin' Ray's, Hattie B's chicken goes a step in the wrong direction which their hot chicken rub. I expected a little more oomph. Still though, claps all around.",

No I wasn't an improvisational jazz player on break from my set, but I do know and love fried chicken, and Hattie's delivers some tasty bird.  Forget the price, you're in Vegas.  And even if it is a bit more expensive than say, KFC or El Pollo Loco, it is better, and it is served up in the middle of a 3.9 billion dollar establishment, where you wouldn't expect to find fast food in the first place.  So just, dig in! and, enjoy.  (Sorry no pics taken, my hands were too greasy from eatin' to reach into my pocket for my phone.)  We split a half a bird with medium hot crust, which came with two sides (french fries and cole slaw) which at first the medium seemed like it might have been too spicy, but after our taste buds settled into the experience it tasted just about right (the heat comes from the battered skin only, so biting into the chicken itself allows for respite from the spice).  Although I usually prefer dark chicken meat to light, because it tends to be more flavorful and moister, Hattie's cooked our bird so well that the white meat, even the largest piece, the breast, was exceptionally good and even better than the wing or leg.  If you are a serious gambler you know that there are times, especially when you have just won a grip of money, that you get really hungry and aren't necessarily in the mood for a sit down elaborate white table cloth meal - and for these times, there is Hattie's.  Finding great fried chicken in the middle of a Las Vegas casino hotel was a pleasant experience.  So stop putting on airs! just because you are at the Cosmopolitan.  Try it!  You won't regret it.  But get plenty of napkins, and wash up well, afterwards.",

    "text": "Hattie B's knows how to fry chicken right!   Block 16 Urban Food Hall opened up in the Cosmopolitan not long ago & of all the options, Hattie B's Hot Chicken's menu looked most appealing to me.   As advertised, the Hot Chicken Sandwich is indeed hot. The pickles & coleslaw provided cooling elements, but the spiciness still managed to overpower each painfully delicious bite. I tasted his crisp & juicy chicken breast, ordered with Medium heat level, & wished I'd asked for the same.   Attention to detail is paid, even in their sides. The cheese in their mac & cheese is pimento, a southern specialty. I could taste the individual ingredients that made up the fresh & refreshing red skin potato salad. Unfortunately, the crinkle-cut fries & lemonade were mediocre. A downhome southern meal wouldn't be complete without banana pudding. Hattie B's had four Nilla wafers sitting atop theirs. Those cookies bring me back to childhood, man. With a bottle of water, our bill came out to about $40.   Now I have a recommendation for when friends text me, \"I'm in Vegas, know a good chicken place?!\"",

I had the chicken sandwich with mild heat (spice level). It was pretty spicy for a mild, but the spice is delicious. It came with a side--I tried the Mac and cheese, which was delicious. It was creamy and really cheesy with a bit of spicy kick, but not too spicy. Although on the pricier side ($14), it was a super filling meal.",

We had the dark leg and thigh medium and I added a spicy strip.  Our sides were fries and the coleslaw.    The strip was very spicy but I enjoyed the crunch and the flavor.  The leg and thigh medium was not too spicy.  It was also juicy and very flavorful.  The coleslaw helped balance the heat.    The fries are tossed in seasoning which seemed too salty and over the top with everything else.  Plain fries would have been better with the chicken.

To begin, the food court that is on the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan is super cute and upscale. This is the only restaurant that I have tried so far in the food court, but I will be back for a much more!   So, of course this is a newer trend of the \"Nashville style\" hot chicken. Of course I had to try the chicken breast sandwich in medium, I added the pimental macaroni and cheese as my side .    The chicken breast, to me, should have been more focused on being juicy, but it came off a bit drier with many tough chews and salty in Medium. (3.5/5)   The pimento Mac was delicious, spicier than the chicken in Medium and they perfect compliment with creaminess! This saved my meal. (5/5)   The person that I was with tried both and he ate most of the macaroni and cheese but only took one by of the chicken.   Since chicken breast can be a little bit drier, I'll definitely be back in try the dark meat in mild and my favorite dessert , banana pudding!  Price: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Food: 4/5",

Our family loves fried chicken so another mental note made during our recent visit to Las Vegas.  We decided to come for dinner around 6pm.  Ordered: *1 order of dark meat - drumstick & thigh that comes with choice of two sides & *2 orders of the 1/2 whole chicken with choice of two sides.  Select the heat level = mild, medium, hot, or damn hot.  We were scared.  We all went with mild which still had a little heat.  The chicken pieces were very generous as were the sides.  I got creamy cole slaw & pimento mac & cheese.  I was so full from eating my two pieces of chicken that I took the slaw to go.  They provide take out boxes with flatware and bags in case you've got leftovers.  Our daughter couldn't finish her 1/2 chicken and took most of it as leftovers.  She said it was just as good the next day.  Our order taker was very efficient.  She worked two registers at the same time.  And like I mentioned in another Yelp review, the Cosmopolitan's cash registers all have function keys with three different gratuity amounts that you select from.  It's added on to your total bill.    The chicken was moist and tender and prepared perfectly.  Made for a great dinner.",

I want to try other food they serve, but the chicken sandwich is unbeatable. I thought it was going to be small, but to my surprise, it was bigger than expected. The chicken was juicy and the batter covering it was fried to perfection. With all the hype on Popeye's Chicken, Hattie B's takes the title of the best chicken sandwich!",

The menu has a wide array of options from dark to light meat, sides (greens, mcaroni and cheese, potato salad, etc) and the special chicken sandwich. I ordered the sandwich MILD and woohoo BABY! It had some kick. Not an unbearable kick but one that definitely surprised me because usually mild is just a teaser. The sandwich was crispy and the bun was beautifully soft, stacked with coleslaw and layered with pickles. The coleslaw was a little overwhelming for me so I took about half of it off. After that, it was great. If salt is a thing for you, I will say that it was a bit salty. I'm not sure if that was seasoning from the chicken or the hot pepper. The French fries were also perfectly crinkled and delicious. If you get a sandwich above mild, good luck and be prepared. It's definitely a nice challenge to accept.",

The line did not move for 25 minutes (I counted). If you find yourself in a similar position try one of the spots across the hall. They're equally good and worth a try.   As for the food that I eventually got (should have brought a sleeping bag) it was just ehhhh. I've been to another location before which ultimately was much better in terms of their small white meat platter. There were at least two other spots without a line at the time in the food court area where they're located. Sushi place looked good but couldn't do that because of my allergies. Would've tried the sandwich spot if I could go back in time.   All of that being said, they straight up need to give Hattie B's their own restaurant at the Cosmo. They need a proper kitchen to accommodate the West Coast masses craving real hot chicken. Give them their own space already!",

I'm not sure what's hotter, the heat in Vegas or the heat this chicken brings to the table. I definitely shed a few tears eating this thing, happy tears of course. Probably one of the tastiest chicken sandwiches I've ever eaten! There are 5 levels of spiciness to choose from when ordering your chicken. I went with the 'damn hot' which is one level below their hottest, 'go cluck yourself,'  I'm not sure I'd be able to handle the spiciest level, as I was struggling with the 'damn hot' itself. It was definitely a 'hurts so good' kind of a meal and I was still paying for it later but I would absolutely order it again even!",

I have the same chicken fingers in the cafeteria at my job.  The blue cheese sauce tastes like the chemicals that keep it shelf stable.

If you had chicken from the original Hattie B's in Nashville then you will be disappointed because the heat, flavor and texture does differ some. If you have never had this chicken from the Nashville Location then you will have a better experience.  We both ordered a small dark \"HOT\" platter because we both enjoyed that from the Nashville Location. We also tried a \"Shut The Cluck\" chicken fingers just for fun because it was only like $3.00.  I took a bite into my \"Hot\" chicken and didn't get the sting or aroma that the Nashville one had.....:(......./.This one seemed slightly greasier and with even less crunch.....The other differences was I got more sweet here and less cayenne taste and much less heat.  For fun we tried the chicken fingers and went for the hottest level called \"Shut the cluck\" besides being dry chicken the flavor and heat here wasn't like a \"HOT\" from Nashville....It was very disappointing.   Sides are about equal to most BBQ places....(not the best but ok)  Worth a try but not the same as from Nashville (less heat and flavor with more sweet)",

    "text": "I discovered Hattie B's accidentally as I was walking towards Marquee Nightclub since they're neighboring businesses.I was pretty excited to check it out since I haven't been to the original one in Nashville yet.  As an LA native, I have to compare Hattie B's to Howlin' Rays and this will probably strike some debate/controversy. With Hattie B's popping up in TV shows and people talking about how epic the original location in Nashville was, I had very high expectations.   I ordered the medium spicy hot chicken sandwich and objectively it was a delicious sandwich. The spices were fantastic and the breading was light and crispy. However, the reason it didn't rate so highly was because it was very clear that the fried chicken breast was fried way ahead of time and has been sitting around for awhile.   The mac n cheese was stellar though.  Verdict: Howlin Rays in LA is much better because it's freshly fried and the high turnover ensures the food being fresh and hot. Although I did prefer the lighter breading at Hattie Bs.",

My friend told me about this place called Hattie B's and that it was similar to that of another place I visited in Los Angeles, said that I would like it and it's very comparable to it.   His suggestion did not disappoint. This Nashville style chicken was delicious, the flavors were on point and the chicken was very juicy. It's hidden away inside one of the resorts, but I would definitely recommend coming by. The line was very short, menu was simple and the food was great.   Out of the places I've been so far, it probably ties for second. I felt like the sides were alright, the fries could've used a little something more, not sure what, the pimento Mac and cheese was alright. Overall, I would definitely come back if I were in the area.",

    "text": "Solid choice - Hattie's is one of my fav chicken joints, and this Vegas rendition does a decent job  Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmo, Hattie B's is bunched with a few other small restaurants that share communal seating. The line at Hattie's is longer than any of the others, which should tell you something by itself! That being said, the line moves quickly and the food is to you within a few minutes. Unfortunately, seating is very limited, so you'll either have to wander off to eat somewhere else, or cut a B for a booth.   We tried a number of things from the menu, from the spicy chicken, what the pluck, half chicken, mac & cheese, slaw, fries.. they were all delicious, especially the Spicy Half Bird with Pimento Mac & Cheese. My mouth was on fire, though, and I couldn't get a cup of free water (had to pay $4)!? Not good.   On that note, prices are pretty high in general. To combat that, and given the size of portions, you can definitely share a plate if you're with somebody.",

I mean it was decent, but I am being more biased because I had awesome hot chicken in Nashville. We all shared the sides in our group which were good. For the Cosmo on the strip, the prices were actually a good value at $12 with the exception of an over priced small Pepsi at $5.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, but Yelp doesn't have that option. Nothing here was amazing, but just fair and not bad. I would go back to get my hot chicken fix, because there is no other choices in Vegas.",

They do not offer free cups of tap water - which seems unreasonable for a place that is known for their hotter than hot fried chicken. Almost a safety risk in my opinion. Anyway, I refused to pay for water and opted to find free water in the casino instead.  I did think the chicken was tasty however. It was moist and the medium I ordered was spicy enough for  me. My bf ordered the Shut the Cluck Up! because he loves the challenge of spicy food and he finished it! (Doesn't that deserve free tap water, Hattie's?) I wouldn't exactly say the chicken I got was the food highlight of my trip to Vegas, but it was above average food.  If I were to try Hattie B's again, it most definitely won't be at the Cosmopolitan location. This place is milking off us poor Vegas tourists. I know -- it's Vegas so I should expect Vegas prices, but the contradiction of being known for spicy food and not offering free water is too much for me.  Atmosphere: 3/5 - It's food court style, so nothing special. Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 - My mom had trouble paying on the iPad and didn't receive much help from the staff here.",

The bite was tender and juicy and every bit of the juice ran down my hands! I ended up getting heat level \"Damn Hot\" and it was SO DAMN HOT! I used like twenty napkins and my nose ran so much from the heat lol! I had to take breaks in between couple of bites from the heat. ( so good. And spicy) The macaroni was so delicious and had some red peppers which made the perfect zest! The sweet tea WAS SO GOOD and refreshing in 115 degrees Vegas heat. The only thing I'd say is that they need their own store front. The line was very long and the food is too damn good to pass up! @feli_Inayah",

My friends and I went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no line but there was a 45 minute wait on food, which I thought was weird. I guess a big order came in? My friend, who has been to the Nashville location and this Vegas location before I did, told me that the spice levels were off between Nashville and Vegas; Vegas goes down one level in terms of spice. Her Nashville pick was medium so she got the hot here in Vegas. I should have listened to her because I ended up staying with the medium and it was really a mild flavor. For those who frequent Howlin Rays in LA, I would recommend going up a level when trying Hattie B's here in Vegas.  And I guess that's why my experience here is less than stellar than my experience in Nashville. The hot chicken just wasn't hot! But the chicken was still well fried and juicy. I also LOVED the mac and cheese. With my combo with two sides, I got two mac and cheeses, hehe. We devoured our meal in one of the many tables/booths of the dining area of that food hall.   Overall, we had a good experience, but the spice level was off (as it did not match the True spice level in Nashville) and the wait time was just way too long. I would definitely come back again though, especially since it's open late on the weekends!",

The chicken is not huge in size unlike Howlin Rays. Just messy to eat. Although I love their crispy crinkle fries. The fried chicken looks like regular fried chicken (looking at someone's meal while waiting in line). No tables just stools facing the kitchen wall.  I wish the chicken was more crispy.",

I know it was fresh, but maybe they need to change the oil, because that kind of tasted off because of that. Because the inside of the chicken was very juicy and delicios. Only the outer skin had an \"off\" taste.   We got the \"southern\" style large. The southern has no heat, and we're both wimps when it comes to heat and spice, so we opted for that.   For the price that you pay, it's worth it. No issue with the price.   The fries, however, has a very nice flavoring with a mix of spices. To me, the fries were better than the chicken, and I would go here just for the fries to be honest.",

    "text": "Clucking good eats!  We're talking about some good Nashville hot chicken.  Juicy and tender inside from a soak in buttermilk infused hot sauce.  The telltale vinegar notes apparent.  Classic seasoning of onion powder, garlic powder, sweet paprika and cayenne.  Crisp but not crunchy on the outside.  Increased heat is achieved through chili oil infusions with a very forward heat.  You know immediately if you made a mistake in heat level.  You will feel the burn.  Mild, medium, hot, and damn hot; just remember, this isn't about proving your manhood, taste matters.  Medium is plenty satisfying.  Choose between dark (connected thigh / drum) or white (connected breast / wing).  Larger pieces creates different levels of spice and juiciness as you eat.  The dark meat is obviously juicer with more flavor.  All orders come with two sides;  OK, fast food style creamy cole slaw, well cooked but basic collards, crispy but salty fries, horrible, mushy, bloated mac and cheese.  That said, who cares.  It's about feasting on Mr. Clucky not the sides.  Fast food service still lacking efficiency and speed.  Part of the Cosmo's Block 16 food hall.  A worthy \"cheap\" eats option on the Strip.",

They offer pieces of fried chicken with sides like mac and cheese or greens, or a sandwich on a buttery bun. I got the medium sandwich with a side of mac. The mac and cheese was fantastic, although I didn't care for the greens. The sandwich was good but I felt the seasoning was a bit on the salty side.

I am an Orange County transplant and tried Jaybirds recently so I felt Hattie's was almost an exact replica. Who copied who?   Located in the cosmopolitan on the second floor is the lovely Hattie's which is in a small food court area.  Pricing is fair for Vegas especially since it's in the cosmo. I got the chicken tenders that were $12.50 for three with two sides. My hunny got the chicken sandwich for $14 which came with one side. Pricing for food was great but drinks not so much. I got a small bottle of champagne that only filled 1/3 of the cup for $15. I thought they would give a full cup not a small bottle. They also don't offer cups of water--lame so regardless you have to buy a water bottle for $8 or get a lemonade for $5. Otherwise, extra sauces are .25-.50 I believe.   Food is pretty good. I am always cautious about adding heat to my chicken so I added mild. Not the lowest but not the hottest either. It tasted delicious on my tenders. But what truly satisfied my belly was the potatoes salad--omg do not pass on this-it is sinfully delicious! I also ordered the Mac n cheese- it had a little spice kick to it but nothing to write home about. Otherwise, the crinkle cut fries were on point too.   Service was quick and nice enough. There was a line but waited 12 minutes at most. There was also plenty of seating available. Overall, pretty solid Nashville chicken dining experience along the strip. I recommend.",

Not over the top hot but barrable for someone who can't take the heat. Crinkle fries were crispy and soft on the inside, perfectly fried. Also don't forget the ranch, you will need one for each person.  Price was overall reasonable. 20 bucks for the platter with no drink and two sides.

For the Vegas strip, this place is a cheap eats god-send.  $14 or so gets you a platter with three huge chicken tenders with toast, pickles, sauce, and two sides.  We opted for the pimento mac and cheese (creamy, piquant, delicious) and the fries (crispy, salty, irresistible).  The chicken was the main attraction, and it did not disappoint.  Their dry rub and batter smell spicy -- you can literally smell it before you take a bite.  And that was just the medium!  We'll be back on future trips for sure.",

This is my second time eating here but this first time I wasn't super freaking drunk. I remember it being much better the first time around. Womp womp. I thought the hype was real! But slamming down shots of Jack makes everything better.   I will say that I was so unsatisfied that I asked JD very nicely the same night to take me to Popeye's. I started out this review with 3 stars, but I think 2 is really more like it and here's why.   What we ordered: The white meat plate, hot, with potato salad and coleslaw, a sweet tea and a side of ranch.  The piece of chicken we got was slightly over cooked, almost tasting a little burnt and small. And if I'm telling you it's small, it is. I buy that natural/organic/non hormone chicken so I get the difference between some beefy chicken breasts, too. It didn't have that great, thick crunchiness either. Hot? No. It was really like it had dark red colored oil all over it. The flavor and spice level weren't there. I read in another review that it was too salty. Polar opposite here. There was virtually no spice.  We ordered our food for here but sat next to a couple who had theirs to go. The containers the sides came in were at least 1/2 a size small than ours. Freaking cheap and wasteful on Hattie B's part. The paper bowls they use for the dine in orders are definitely the ones that are lid compatible. Instead, they create MORE plastic waste.   These reasons, coupled with the price point, are why I have this place 2 stars.",

The chicken was not quite as hot as I expected - I generally do not have a high spice tolerance and I felt pretty comfortable eating the chicken. The mac and cheese was creamy and the southern greens were fresh.   While my overall experience was good, I feel like I need to try Hattie B's in Nashville to have a full opinion. My mind was not blown as I thought it would be, but I still had a positive experience and a good meal. In Vegas, it's a good opportunity to give it a try and see if the trip to Nashville is worth it.",

    "text": "When my friends and I first walked through the Block 16 food hall, I was impressed with how good all of the different eateries looked.  However, while Pok Pok may have technically been the first thing we tried, Hattie B's was easily the one I was most excited for.  Funny thing is, I actually knew nothing about them until I was staring down their menu and looking up their reviews on Yelp.  Of course, neither did anything but raise my excitement - from what they had to offer to their Yelp reviews, everything I saw just screamed deliciousness!  What shame it fell short for me...  As you could probably deduce from their name, Hattie B's menu is all about (Nashville-style) fried chicken.  So, whether it's in the form of pieces, a sandwich, or tenders, don't expect to find much else, save for their selection of sides and dessert.  Although, I highly doubt anyone would be coming here looking for anything but fried chicken!    While I was tempted to try their fried chicken sandwich (the one I saw this girl eating nearby looked great), I figured their fried chicken was the way to go.  However, rather than have to choose between white or dark meat, I ordered the HALF BIRD PLATE ($19), which comes with a Breast/Wing and a Leg/Thigh with your choice of Two Sides (Pimento Mac & Cheese and Red Skin Potato Salad), Bread, and Pickles.  Being that their fried chicken is done Nashville-style (read: hot), you also choose the spice level you want (I went with \"mild\" since the worker said it still had some heat to it).  Now, I have to say - even though it felt a little steep to pay $19 for two pieces and sides, this was an impressive tray of food - the portions were generous (the pieces were huge!) and everything looked dope.  In terms of taste, the chicken was pretty solid; it wasn't all that spicy, but both were tender and moist and the batter wasn't super heavy (actually, I wouldn't have minded if it had been a little thicker).  Sadly, the sides were a little more uneven.  The mac & cheese was pretty good (I like the pimento cheese), but the potato salad was a little generic to me.  Along with my fried chicken, I also ordered their LEMONADE, as well as some of my friend's BANANA PUDDING ($6) and let me tell you...they were AWESOME.  Unfortunately, I don't have a photo of either one (forgot the first, wasn't planning on trying the latter), but that might be for the best with the banana pudding.  It wasn't much to look at, save for the cookies on top, but I loved how creamy the texture was, how it wasn't overly sweet, and how much flavor it packed.  As for the lemonade, it was super refreshing and had a nice balance of tartness and sweetness.  Based purely on my own order, I was torn on whether to give three or four stars overall.  The chicken was pretty solid, but the sides were rather underwhelming.  What's more, it's even harder to praise the experience when I think of what I could have got instead for the money.  After factoring in the banana pudding and lemonade though, it wasn't hard to give that bump to Hattie B's.  I can't say for certain if/when I'll be back to get the fried chicken again, but you can be damn sure I'll be returning for a drink and dessert!",

The chicken, although tender, was insanely salty -- essentially inedible. I barely finished my meal since it was so salty. I'd ordered a lemonade, but the lemonade was incredibly sweet and artificial tasting, like they'd dumped a pound of sugar into their mix. I tried to trade off bites of chicken with the lemonade to balance the meal, but it was just disappointing. I hear that Hattie B's is a lot better in Nashville, so I guess I'll need to go try it there.   I'd avoid coming here, especially with the higher Vegas prices.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying a \"Hot Chicken\" place. We came here last weekend during our Vegas trip for some lunch. One of my friends said it was pretty good and he wanted everyone to have a taste. It is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It is in a little food court with a couple other food places. I saw a thai food place, a sandwich place, a sushi place. There was definitely a variety. When we arrived, it was not too crowded and we were able to secure a couple tables for 11 people.  My boyfriend and I ordered a SM White and SM Dark so we can share and try both. I am a white meat lover and he is a dark meat lover. I was more of a fan of the white meat chicken breast and it was a pretty darn big piece. We were a little disappointed because my boyfriend's dark meat chicken piece seemed super small and it only came with one piece. (I am still convinced that someone walked by and stole his other piece). The side dishes were flipping delicious and very filling. We tried the Cole Slaw (refreshing), Mac & Cheese (SO CREAMY AND GOOD), and the Mashed Potatoes (just like momma makes them). It was decently priced for a Vegas lunch meal and it also comes with a piece of toast. Overall, it was a good simple lunch that filled you up.",

There are tables and chairs near the place . I got the wing thigh white meat with potato salad and mac n cheese. The wing was extra crispy from the hot sauce. It was a bit dry on the inside. The Mac n Cheese was pretty so creamy with a hint of spiciness to it. The potato salad was fresh and had a perfect amount of dressing on it. The chicken tender was perfect. It was moist, crispy and we'll seasoned. A bit pricy because of location. Probably, just come back for the chicken sandwich or chicken tender with sides",

Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.  Ordered half chicken (mild), one tender (shut the cluck up) along with greens and cole slaw. Sloshy (alcoholic) and sweet tea. Banana pudding (definitely skip).  Only tip I have is don't order mild, get something spicier. The shut the cluck up flavor burned so bad but it was so tasty spicy.",

    "text": "I came here for the hot chicken but ended up eating one of the best pieces of fried chicken in recent memory.   My first order was the small dark meat with just the \"hot\" spice level, since I'd be sharing with my wife. It wasn't very spicy but the piece of dark meat was so juicy and tender and fried with perfectly crispy skin. It was glorious. The spices gave it some great flavor with just a hint of heat at the end. Just a fantastic piece of fried chicken.  My second order was the chicken tenders with the \"shut the cluck up!!\" spice level. First of all, I noticed that the chicken tenders were a lot dryer than the dark meat pieces and not nearly as flavorful. So if you have to make a choice, go with the dark meat. But man these were pretty spicy. Not kick your ass spicy like some of the levels that Howlin' Ray's has, but enough to make you sweat. If you enjoy spicy food as much as I do, get the dark meat at this spice level and you'll have yourself a mighty fine meal.",

If you're not aware, this restaurant gained popularity and a big following from their original family-owned and operated Nashville location. It's comfort food to fill your belly.  The small meal comes with 2 sides and one sauce, and you can choose from white or dark meat. We went with the small white piece meal, medium spice. With 5 levels of spice you can be as daring as you want, but we played it safe and the spice level was perfect for us. I still had to drink a lot of water. The chicken was juicy and the breading was nice and crisp. I do have to note that it wasn't the best hot chicken that I've tried, but it was a super close second and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. The Pimento Mac n Cheese is to die for!!! It's soooo cheesy and has great flavor. Next time I might even go for double sides of that!",

[LOCATION] This spot is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, inside Block 16.  [WAIT] There was a line that wrapped around the stand both times I've been there but the wait time for both ordering and for our food didn't take too long.  [FOOD] I ordered the hot chicken sandwich and picked the mac n cheese for the side. The first time I ordered the sandwich I got it as Medium. It was the perfect amount of spice where it doesn't make your mouth burn. The second time I ordered I was drunk and decided to get Hot. Hot definitely left my tongue and lips stinging a little bit, so I would recommend getting the sandwich Medium.  The chicken was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and just such a delicious, perfect bite with the crunch of the coleslaw. The side of mac n cheese was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I don't know what they put it in it but there is so much flavor in every bite and it's soooo creamy.  We ordered a lemonade too and it was surprisingly delicious for just a lemonade drink! Would recommend!",

We paid a total of $35 for 2 sandwich combos & 1 drink.    Taste: The sandwich tasted great.  We did enjoy it as well as the fries.  If you like a little bit of heat I would go with the medium heat.  The mild tasted as if nothing was on the meat.  The fries were seasoned well. My husband had the medium heat but could have went up to the hot.  Environment: The place was loud with music playing in the background.   It was a fun experience and would be great to eat there with friends.   Not much seating available though.  Service:  The staff was friendly and we received our food extremely quick.  There was no wait time in line.    Location:   This was located on the 2nd level of the Cosmopolitan hotel.   Comparison to Howling Ray's:  In my opinion if you love Howling Ray's come to this place with an open mind not to compare the two.  Hatties is good but doesn't match H.R.  the heat wasn't there.  If you order mild at H.R. you will have to go medium here, maybe even hot.  Maybe the heat is watered down for the masses at Hatties.  The slaw is also better at H.R.  So please go here with an open mind because the food is good.",

They're very efficient at order and delivery all within a few minutes. I opted for the Small Dark plate with my two sides as pimento Mac n Cheese and the Southern greens. I chose medium heat for my chicken. The chicken was crunchy and delicious and served on top a piece of white bread that soaks up the goodness. The Mac n Cheese was my favorite part of the meal...I could've eaten it for days. The greens were soft and good but nothing overly special. I also had the sweet tea that was very pleasant and not overly sweet. All in all a terrific experience, don't forget to pick up some wet-naps because you'll need them when you're done!

Located in the Cosmopolitan- Boulevard tower, precisely inside the new Urban 16 Food Hall. Easy to spot, thanks to the noticeably long lines.  For my lunch, I had the small dark meat chicken (hot) plus chicken tenders. The combo comes with two sides of choice. I picked the crinkled fries and the Pimento Mac and cheese. The fries was crispy but extremely salty and the Mac was just mushy and bland. Not a fan!   The chicken, on the other hand, was excellent! The tenders were meaty and good, but it was the hot chicken that whet my appetite and did magic for both my palate and belly - Juicy, peppery, salty and HOT!!  Overall, I found their menu to be appealing and generally good. Pricing wise, it was pretty affordable for Cosmopolitan's standard and portion is mostly big! The chicken is certainly the one you should not miss and I can't wait to be back for more hotness :)",

After reading some Yelp reviews and watching what people were ordering I decided to go with the three jumbo chicken tenders with medium spice, pimento mac & cheese, and  southern greens.  I was really close to adding a 4th chicken tender and I'm so glad I didn't because they're the biggest chicken tenders I've ever had (see photo).  They were freshly fried, perfectly spicy, and their ranch dipping sauce was the perfect accompaniment.  The pimento mac & cheese was unique as well as rich and filling so if you get it be sure to eat the chicken tender tenders first before filling up.  The southern greens were pretty good, I wanted more spice but for a place which prides itself on spice I was disappointed that I couldn't find any hot sauce bottles.  That's a first-world problem so don't let that stop you from enjoying this great eatery.",

Don't worry though, there are less spicy options for the babies as well. Hehe.   So excited to have Hattie B's in Vegas! Went to the original one during a visit to Nashville and haven't been able to have anything even close to comparable since.   A little pricy, but that's what we get for putting it smack dab in the center of the strip. Totally worth it. The mac & cheese, dipping sauces, fries, and of course the chicken. All so delicious and the ultimate comfort food. You haven't really had hot chicken until you have had Hattie B's. And if you can't get to Nashville, Vegas is the second best option. So stop by and singe off your eyebrows. It's fun, I promise.",

Nice spice level I think we got the medium spice and it definitely had a kick to it.  The fries were amazing! You definitely have to get fries for a side! Got the Mac and cheese as the other side also but that was not nearly as good as the fries. The fries were nice and crisp and had a perfect seasoning to it!  Food came out hot and service was good however I will say not much on the service side since it was take your order and pick up your food.  Overall though definitely worth come to and get some delicious chicken in a casual setting!",

Juicy chicken thigh. Very light breading. They offer several heat options. I got the Shut the Cluck Up, their hottest, which combined a flavorful Nashville hot seasoning with a heat that builds a little(?) but then it doesn't anymore. Overall? Good, but not great.  I got pimento macaroni and cheese for my side; it was soggy and flavorless. I'd been looking forward to trying this place for a long time but maybe it was a mistake eating here less than a week after having the best chicken sandwich on earth at Crack Shack in San Diego.

I was expecting more of a buffalo chicken flavor but it was more cayenne and a dry rub. Even the crinkle fries has a lot of flavor and heat. If you do not like spicy food, even the mild might be too hot for you. The mild is on par with medium at most wing places or medium heat at Chitpotle, to give you a sense. I like some heat and was glad I went with the mild. I was a little disappointed that my chicken was a bit dry and that the Cole slaw needed salt. Generous portions. You could split between two people if you're not a big eater. The Arnold Palmer was excellent. All around, it was still a great eating experience and I would recommend over any big chain you'll get in Vegas.",

The chicken just didn't taste right compared to the Nashville one.  The collard greens were severely undercooked so it was very bitter, and I really like bitter.

This place is similar to a chicken place in Los Angeles. But I think this is the original Nashville style spicy chicken. Got the half bird and it didn't disappoint. Sides were good.

When I returned back to Los Angeles, I looked up Nashville Hot Chicken everywhere and found some disappointing variations. I really wanted my husband to try it but alas, couldn't find anything like it in LA. Then I stumbled across Hattie B's in Vegas and it's been a ritual every time we visit Vegas. It's just perfect in every way. If you can't tolerate spice though, I'd go with the mild. For my Indian taste buds that's very accustomed to spicy food, the hot was way too hot and had me sweating and my lips burning. I've decided the medium is just right for me. Not hot and packed with flavor. The fries are great, and the coleslaw is nice but the star is the chicken. You won't regret this place if you like fried chicken !",

Ironically my husband and I were visiting Nashville two weeks prior solely for hot chicken and whiskey... and we decided on a last minute weekend getaway to Vegas and we ate Hattie B's every day. It's that good.  I must say though it is a bit different. It isn't as spicy as Nashville but everything still is really tasty. The line is also a LOT shorter!! My only gripe about this place is you can't just get the chicken and you're forced to get sides. The sides are really good too but I'd rather just eat the protein.  As for spicy level... here, I like it hot (and medium in Nashville). It's definitely toned down at this location.  I also loooove the banana pudding so I recommend getting that in the end, even if you're full. You can always refrigerate it and eat it later :)  I'm so glad Hattie B's is in Vegas so I don't have to make the trek all the way to Nashville now!",

    "text": "After seeing Hattie B's in Nashville on tv I knew someday that I would have to try their chicken. Well a trip to Las Vegas surprised me with Hattie B's on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan in the new Block 16 food market. I love fried chicken and if your used to KFC or Popeye's then your in for a real treat. Hattie B's offers multiple levels of heat from no heat added to extreme. My wife got the no heat added and I went for the traditional hot. I was warned that it was not for the faint of heart and that it was packing serious heat, I accepted the challenge with open arms. I was very glad that I did, this sandwich packs a whopping amount of heat. But more importantly it has such a great coating and flavor that it wins you over. If you don't like your mouth on fire then stay away. Personally I felt that the coleslaw helped reduce the heat and worked well with the chicken. Sandwich was a little messy but that was an added bonus for me, I enjoyed the experience and having some leftover coleslaw to go with the chicken that was bigger than the bun. My wife got the chicken strips which were very large, flavorful, and juicy. We both really enjoyed how the chicken was breaded and the way that it added a certain crunch that we've never had with fried chicken before. Now let me address my personal favorite part of my Hattie B's dinner, their Southern Banana pudding. I am a total sucker for banana dessert and not that fake banana flavored crap. I seriously could have eaten 10 cups of this stuff and went back for more. It was definitely homemade pudding with fresh cut bananas in it and I'll be back for more the next time I'm in Las Vegas!",

The chicken is a good sized piece. I wanted to try the spiciest but since I didn't have unlimited water I thought I shouldn't chance it. They do have water there and utensils if you eat there.

The chicken was just chicken. The macaroni is not bad but nothing great. I tried some greens too and they werent too bad but nothing great.

    "text": "I always visit Hattie B's in Nashville, so having a convenient location at Las Vegas inside the Cosmopolitan is a dream come True! This Hattie B's does a great job of replicating the original Hattie B's flavor and taste from Nashville. However, due to being in Las Vegas, their prices are quite inflated. We ordered one lemonade and two plates, which were the 1/2 bird and small white. The lemonade was draft and cost $5 for one cup (at least they give you one free refill). Anyways, for the plates, if you like a good amount of spice, then I would highly recommend getting the chicken Hot. This level is not too overwhelming and provides a good kick. Honestly, you can't go wrong with either plate because the chicken skin is very crispy, and the chicken meat is juicy. Also for the 2 sides that come with the plate, I highly recommend getting mac & cheese and french fries. The mac and cheese is very creamy and flavorful. Also, the fries have a good amount of seasoning and pair well with the honey mustard dipping sauce. Overall, I am really ecstatic that Las Vegas finally got a Hattie B's, and this is a great place to go once you've made a lot of money in Vegas!",

    "text": "This unassuming eatery is located on the second floor of the high end Cosmopolitan in Vegas.  As a disciple of Hot food, I'm always on the trail for authentic, well prepared spicy fare and this place didn't disappoint.  The menu is simple, offering chicken in various forms including breast's, thighs, wings, tenders and a chicken breast sandwich.  They can be ordered in different gauges of heat from mild to \"What the Cluck\" which is made with ghost peppers.  I ordered the \"damn hot\" which came with one side and kosher pickles. It didn't disappoint as the heat was damn hot, but not to the point where there was just heat without flavor. Also, for the price point of $12 the quantity and quality of the chicken breast was amazing.  My spouse ordered the mild sandwich which had a hint of spice which was perfect for her non-heat palate.  My only disappointment was not being notified that you can order items with the different heat so you can enjoy the entire spectrum of spice. By way of example, you can get your three chicken tenders , mild, medium and What the Cluck. Wtf, I mean Cluck! Why didn't they say so?   Which brings me to my only stricture regarding Hattie B's. The workers at the register were totally clueless and were unable to guide the patrons through the complexities of the somewhat simple menu or even where to pick up your food. What the Cluck! Now that may be fine in Tennessee but won't play well in Vegas.  If not for a waitress named Azalea, we would never found where to pick up our food or found out that you can order the food with a variety of heat with your order. She was also knowledgeable about the history of the company which lended to the overall experience.   Lastly, all the sides were spot on, especially the Mac and Cheese.   So, if you're looking for high quality food with an array of heat levels at low prices, this is the place for you? Can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been on this hot chicken kick. I had remembered hearing about Hattie B's in Nashville so I was super stoked that they had it in Vegas now! It is situated in Cosmo among other restaurants. We were lucky, we came on a Saturday evening around normal dinnertime and there was no wait. The service is pretty quick. You go up and order your food, then find a spot to sit and they'll call out your number for the order. The food came out super quick so you won't be waiting long to get your hands on some delicious hot chicken!  We were not super hungry so we wanted to share a meal which turned out to be the perfect portion for us. We shared 3 jumbo tenders with 2 sides (mac and cheese and fries) plus the Nashville comeback sauce. My husband is more of a spicy eater than me so thankfully we were able to split the spiciness level of the chicken. We ordered 2 medium and 1 mild. For me the mild had a nice little kick to it, making it enjoyable to eat. My husband loved his medium spicy. When I tried the medium it definitely was spicier than the mild, but it was as terribly spicy of a medium as other places where I need water or milk immediately after. However, I definitely wouldn't be able to finish a whole medium tender by myself. I had imagined the difference between the mild and the medium would just be the spiciness level, but there was a slight difference in flavor/spiciness kick between the two levels as well. The mild to me tasted a little bit saltier. The tenders were tender, juicy, and packed with flavor with each bite! The mac and cheese was delicious and creamy. The french fries were crispy and seasoned well. The comeback sauce was amazing! The perfect dipping sauce for the chicken or even the french fries.  I would definitely come here again to get the tenders again! It is a well portioned meal and decently priced especially for being in Vegas!",

They really nickel & dime you at this place: $5 for an iced tea and NO REFILLS (I only wanted one) while you're eating spicy chicken.  Also, no tap water.  If I may borrow the slogan above the cash register: What the Cluck?  You can say goodbye to Southern hospitality & hello to just paying rent at The Cosmopolitan.  I'll tell you right now that Johnny, the owner at Howlin' Ray's, is one of the generous owners & is always tossing in freebies/upgrades with a sweet smile   8 of 10: Fried Chicken sandwich.  The buns were cold (albeit toasted.... how did that happen?) but at least the chicken was piping hot & fabulous (so were the crinkle cut fries).  The taste was surprisingly bland with all that sauce & coleslaw in there.  Is it wrong to be thinking of Howlin' Ray's while I'm eating this?  8 of 10: Small Dark meat platter (think of the \"small\" size as a lunch/big snack, and the \"large\" as a full meal).  The chicken here is legit smaller, but at least the skin is nice & crispy.  If you want to maintain your girlish figure here in Vegas, I suppose this place is an option.  Enjoyed my mac-and-cheese, but wanted a do-over with this ill thought out coleslaw.  It's like the side dish that had to show up for work today & really didn't want to.  Ordered a medium spicy for both (and I LOVE spicy!), but it was probably a notch above what it should be for West coast peeps.  That said, I'll still be going the medium spicy route & just wanted to reiterate all the other comments on here.  For the quality/price/location here in Vegas, I would come back.  However, don't think of this place as a near substitute for Howlin Ray's!  It's the Khloe Kardashian of Nashville Hot Chicken.",

At least the Vegas location. The chicken was hot as described but not flavorful. When consuming spicy food you still want it to have depth. It tasted like bland fried chicken that some hot seasoning packet was thrown on as an after thought. The sides left me wanting for more. The potato salad was lack luster and the greens were made by someone's grandmas evil step sister. Lacking in flavor and stingy with the seasoning meat. 2 stars for decently fast service during the lunch rush and the handy paper menus to help decide on options before ordering. And maybe I just didn't order the right items but the chicken needs some work.",

I returned for a 2nd time, on a different occasion around 10:30pm. The skin was soggy, and the meat was dry. When I asked the ladies working on this Friday night, how long this chicken had been sitting for, they said it was made 20 minutes ago. I asked for fresh chicken and was told it would be another 20 minutes if they were have make me some. I guess they were getting ready to close. Not sure but 2nd one round was pretty disappointing. Not sure if I would go back a 3rd. Maybe try something different if at block 16 if it's not prime lunch or dinner time. Giving 3 out 5. First time was 5 outta 5 this time is a 2 out of 5",

The only reason that I could give it a five star is due to something that's kind of not in their control. There just isn't enough seating for the amount of people that come to eat.

It's only right tho that you take it in stride and know the wait will be worth it. The thing is that as you wait in line and see the chicken being fried up and the sides being put together your mouth is salivating with anticipation . Oh yea did I say this chicken is  flames. Once it's your turn from waiting you want to order everything to it all but I stick to the chicken with heat . I like spicy so this has a Lil kick to it. My side was the red potato salad and had to try the greens out. Both are ok but that chicken sandwich is  FIRE and melts in your mouth!! Had a Red ale beer to wash it down. If your at the cosmo check it out . I know this one will not disappoint",

So, I've heard stories of this place from friends having it in Nashville, and was hoping to have the experience to beat the first time I bit into a Howlin Rays Chicken Sando, but alas it was not.   Swung by here before opening on a Sat morning during a visit to Vegas, and there was already 12+ people in line, but it moved pretty swiftly. Put in my order for 5 chicken sandwiches along with each side, and a jumbo dark meat plate. Everything was medium level spice.   First bite. Hmm this could use more spices and actual flavor. Second bite.  I guess the cole slaw is alright. Third bite. This REALLY could use more FLAVOR, and why is this so bland? This was the general consensus from everyone in the room, and we were just staying upstairs in cosmo, so they were still fresh and only about 7 minutes old from the order being ready to our first bites in the room.   After all the hype about this place fell way short. Friends that had been to the original location with us on this trip had said the OG location was way better, and us newbies had compared it to being equal to a Chic Fil A Spicy Chicken Sandwich.   That being said we've gotta go back and try the Hot level in hopes of there being some actual flavor. We want to taste those spices.   For now Howlin Rays is still the top. This place is not it yet.",

It was big, the chicken breast was spicy (medium), and the comeback sauce....let me tell you...the comeback sauce is sooooo good. I could put it on anything! I'm not too much of a fan about using chicken breasts instead of dark meat for the sandwich. The outside wasn't as crispy as I expected. But all the flavors were there.   It also comes with a side of your choice. I picked the greens and they came out hot and flavorful.   Overall, I would go back again. But maybe try the tenders next time. And extra extra comeback sauce! 4/5 because the coating on the outside wasn't that crispy.",

But that didn't matter to us as long as the juice was worth the squeeze.    They offer 4 levels of hotness.  Mild, medium, hot, and \"d\" hot.  We decided to go with the medium.  But we all felt like we got the hot chicken since the wife and daughter can handle heat better than me.  Sadly we enjoyed the sides better than the chicken even though the skin was deep fried to perfection.  The Mac and cheese, Cole slaw, and potato salad were all excellent.     It's definitely an experience, so I recommend you all see for yourself if $17 for half a chicken, $6 sides, and $4-5 for sodas are worth a second visit.  Overall, 3.5 stars for us, so we rounded to 4.",

My experience in Tennessee was marred by a long wait and \"hot\" chicken that wasn't even hot- apparently their spice scale is pretty lenient. And if you factor in the parking ticket I got there, the Cosmo parking fees are cheaper.  This location was better all the way around. There was a line but it was short and moved quickly, and food was out fast. As for the spice, the medium heat sando had cayenne coming off on my hands just picking it up- this isn't a complaint, medium was satisfyingly spicy, it's a comfortable heat level provided you had a drink. Rumor has it the spice scale is more aggressive here, complete with an exclusive \"Vegas hot\" level that I would not try myself.  The sandwich ($12 w/side) here was great, huge, juicy breast topped with slaw and pickles to help cool off. My go-to side here is the pimiento mac, which is creamy and cheesy with a nice little kick to it. Also shared a chicken tender plate with friends ($11, same heat level), with greens and potato salad, and I found that I prefered my original order across all items. Hankering to go back for that exact order as I type this up!",

    "text": "My first review of 2019!! Just received my YES email and realized through the busy December month I was mostly absent here so I am going to kick the year off with some reviews of our most recent Las Vegas trip and get to a few others locally and in Calgary in the coming days.  There is an amazing \"quick eats\" food area on the second floor of Cosmopolitan that features Milk Bar, Egg Slut, Pok Pok and Hattie B's Hot Chicken, just to mention a few (Secret Pizza is up on the third floor). We were staying next door at The Bellagio and found ourselves looking for a quick bite a few times so I will start with the trio we ate at in the Cosmopolitan for starters today.  When I was in Nashville in late 2017 we tried hitting Hattie B's Hot Chicken but there was literally a line up down the street and our Uber driver suggested McDougals Chicken Fingers & Wings (I reviewed that a while back on here) so we ended up there. So seeing a Hattie B's had opened in Vegas was a no brainer when we were hungry.  Heather and I split an order of chicken tenders (added a fourth tender for an extra $3) with a side of crinkle cut fries, coleslaw and an unsweetened iced tea. We LOVE heat, and ordered the tenders as \"Damn Hot\" level. The tenders came a bit overdone, but the spice level was no joke. It's a dry rub/ seasoning and it had us dying (the way we like it). I had the hottest level McDougals could offer in Nashville (a sauce) and it didn't come close to this in terms of heat. The sides of ranch (Heather) and Blue Cheese (me, because Blue Cheese or GTFO... Ranch is for children) were used up entirely to save off the heat somewhat. They have a hotter level... \"Shut The Cluck Up\" and I can't imagine how hot that is... this was more than enough, even for two people that eat their food at ridiculous spice levels.   The sides were average and I found the side of \"Nashville Comeback Sauce\" tangy and underwhelming... it did not impress me. Had the tenders been cooked perfectly this might have been considered 5 star... the heat/ rub here will have me returning next time were in Vegas!",

My friends and I were already super full from dinner but we were passing this place and we had to try it!  I shared a small dark meat plate with collards and fries with my boyfriend. OMG the chicken is so moist and juicy!! We got the mild chicken and we could've went one step up the spicy level. SOOO good. The fries are also pretty good as well as the collard greens.  I wish I was more hungry when I went here. I would've definitely gobbled it down!  There was one cashier and she was using two registers at the same time. So fast and efficient!",

I drove to Vegas just to eat at Hattie B's.   I endured horrendous parking and dodged annoying \"Vegas-type\" people to eat hot chicken from a chain from Nashville.  I ordered the dark chicken at the medium spicy level. It was everything I imagined it to be. The sides I ordered were a delight as well.   I ordered the spiked lemonade because it was hot AF in the desert. Just what I needed.   Makes me want to finally visit Nashville this year.   The best part was no crazy 4-hour line like the wannabe overhyped hot chicken in Los Angeles.",

    "text": "I recently joined some friends at Block 16 for a food crawl and Hattie B's Hot Chicken was my first stop.   My husband and I ordered a SM White Plate. The Breast Wing Quarter was good and packed the heat. The chicken was tender and delicious. For ease of eating I'd order chicken tenders next time.   I'm not sure what the heat level was of the chicken I received. Others in my group ordered medium like I did, but the chicken had completely different colors. Based on the color I think my chicken was the \"hot!\" and it was hot indeed. The medium tenders ordered by others were the perfect level of heat for me.   My favorite part of the meal were my sides. Red Skin Potato Salad was creamy and had a great tasting dressing on it. The cool dressing also helped cool the mouth in between bites of chicken. The winning side was the Pimento Mac & Cheese. I loved their mac and cheese and would return just for this. There weren't large noticeable pieces of pimento in the side, but it was present in the flavor.   The drinks were also great southern drinks. My Lemonade was delicious and refreshing. My husband enjoyed his Sweet Tea too. The servings are small on drinks so order more than one if you get thirsty. My husband killed his sweet tea in a couple of minutes and needed to find another drink.   I'll definitely return to Hattie B's next time I find myself needing a quick meal at The Cosmopolitan!",

    "text": "Time for Chris V's take on Hattie B's.  Hattie B's Hot Chicken is a well-known Nashville institution that started in 2012 with a menu focused on the local specialty known as Nashville hot chicken. I haven't been to Nashville yet, but when I finally make that trip, I won't have to try Hattie B's because they added a location in Las Vegas with the debut of the Block 16 Urban Food Hall on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip. Block 16 can be found next to Marquee and across from Holstein's, and Hattie B's is right smack in the middle of this food hall, on the other side of District.  I should've taken care to ask my friends to order mild chicken, and I do wish that I'd found the opportunity to try the dark meat too. However, I only tried white meat prepared to medium heat amongst the various dishes, including the Hot Chicken Sandwich ($12), Large White ($15 for 2 breasts and 2 wings), and Tenders ($11 for 3 pc).  The medium heat ended up feeling like a 5 out of 10. Unfortunately, that is more than I can handle comfortably for more than a couple of bites at a time. However, I liked the crunch of the breading and the moistness of the boring-because-it's-not-dark meat. Also, the side of ranch sauce helped to allay some of the fire. Portions seem reasonable even if the prices have an upcharge (from $0.50 to $3.00) compared to the original restaurant. It could be worse on the Strip.  The sides which I tried weren't bad. The collard greens have a bit of a challenging bitterness. The mac 'n' cheese was creamy. The potato salad was delicious and not too sauce-heavy. None of them stood out though, and the white bread presented with some entrees was very plain and hardly worth even taking a small bite.  Hattie B's feels like a 3.5 or 3.75 right now. I'll have to return to try the mild chicken with dark meat and perhaps the banana pudding, a dessert which we most likely skipped due to our desire to try the neighboring spots at Block 16.",

However the greens dont know what kind of meat was in there and was a little disappointed as to it being there because I dont eat pork or beef but it did look like turkey meat.  Now the chicken nooo it was good but it just wasnt like I would have thought it was fried so until the meat under the batter was over cooking and which made my bite hard with a chewy type of thing. Naw not good to me no real taste maybe I should have gotten the hot atleast it has some flavor",

The first chance we got to make a trip we added Hattie's to our foodie list.   Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. We ordered the half chicken to share, which came with a breast, wing, leg and thigh w/ the pimento Mac and Cheese and crisscut fries. We ordered the chicken medium hot and added a side of their comeback sauce. Everything was delicious. The skin on the chicken was crispy and for us had the perfect amount of heat. The inside of the chicken was moist, including the breast, which of course is the perfect combo. The white bread and pickles take away the heat of needed and are the perfect southern touch.   Seating was a little harder to find. The entire Block 16 area in the cosmo is a tight space. Hattie's has its own bar counter seating and some shared tables. We ended up finding space at the bar counter, but only had one chair to share. The food more than makes up for it, but if you're looking for a place to sit, come earlier, have a look out person etc. We enjoyed our food and the space and even got to peek into the kitchen over the counter to see how the magic happens. Great time!",

Like Atomic at WingStop. The chicken was delicious and juicy. It came with two side and I got the greens which was delicious and fresh and the slaw which was fine. Also comes with 1 sauce . Drinks are $5 ( non alcoholic)and refills are included . Staff were nice and the prices are excellent for what you get. We will return here on our next Vegas trip and definitely recommend.",

And while the mini food-court location in the Cosmopolitan has more seating options than Nashville, it's also more expensive and less atmospheric.  Despite being cooked in advance, my chicken sandwich was excellent, and the chicken more than up to par.   One sour spot-- they don't offer tap water, at all (despite any restaurant having to have running potable water). On the positive, they have an okay beer selection-- if you're paying for something to wash down your spicy chicken in Vegas, it might as well have alcohol in it!  Recommended.",

I ordered the chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese and the GF ordered half chicken with fries and cole slaw.   Chicken Sandwich 7/10: sandwich was fresh and the cole slaw gave it a creamy crunch, however, I felt it was lacking a little flavor.   Mac n Cheese 7/10: I thought the Mac n cheese was alright. Nothing to rave about.  Fries 8/10: Fries were excellently crispy but a little on the salty side.  Cole slaw 9/10: delicious, crunchy, creamy.  Overall, I like that you do get a side with the chicken sandwich and two sides with the fried chicken that didn't cost an arm and a leg.

I waited 4 freakin hrs on a Saturday there, and it was worth every second. Luckily, there was no line at Hattie B's when I went last Friday with my buddy.   I tried their chicken sandwich, and it was pretty good. I got the medium level spice, and it wasn't too spicy. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful, and the crinkle-cut fries were excellent! I also got to try some of my buddy's half chicken with the \"shut the cluck up\" spicy level (which is the highest spice level), and it was pretty hot but manageable. The skin was really crisp, and the seasoning was great!   Hattie B's is thee spot for hot chicken in Vegas right now, but I still gotta give the hot chicken crown to Howlin Ray's.   Also, I asked for a cup of water, but they don't give cups of water. I think this applies to all the spots in Block 16 Urban Food Hall. Bottled water/bottled soda is $5.  Pro tip: Bring your own water/ soda if you can.",

    "text": "I had heard about Hattie B's Hot Chicken many times before in the past on TV shows. So I was very happy to hear that they had a location here in the Cosmo. I've previously been to a Nashville hot chicken place in LA so I kind of had an idea of how the food was but I really wanted to see what the original version is.  Overall, the food has fantastic flavor and the line isn't nearly as crazy so that's a win in my book.   I couldn't decide between a chicken platter or the chicken sandwich. And one of the girls recommended that I go with the sandwich.  The girl that was actually working the register was either too nervous or new where she didn't have much personality.  It was another girl at the next register over that recommended food items.  I went with the Hot spiciness, but in hind sight I feel like I should have gone with the next level up.  The seasoning and flavors was really good.  The chicken sandwich came with slaw and pickle slices in it so it plays off with the textures and temperature of the chicken itself.  The sandwiches come with 1 side and i went with the crinkle cut fries.  I was actually surprised how good the fries were, they were crispy yet not too dry and I also really liked the seasoning on it.  I also got the banana pudding that was highly recommended on yelp.  It's definitely a winner.  At first I didn't recognize it on my tray when I got my food and thought it was a side of potatoes or something but then once I opened it up I remembered what it was.  The presentation isn't eyegasmic or anything but it was definitely mouthgasmic.   So how the kiosk is set up, is that you order your food at the registers and they'll give you your drinks and your receipt and they tell you to go to the other end of the booth to pick up your food.  The food orders come out fairly quickly.  I only waited a little bit for my name to be called.   Can't wait to come back and try the other items here.  I'll have to try the platter next time with different sides.",

It was wayyyy too greasy. The bread underneath was good. The side I chose were the Mac and cheese as well as the coke slaw. Cole slaw was good, nothing big but was good. I had high high hopes for the Mac and cheese but it was just ok. Not much flavor, I put a little hot sauce to get some flavor. I couldn't get over the greasy chicken, I mean it's fried, I know but it was too much grease. I got it off my bucket list but wouldn't go again.",

I also ordered a sweet tea.  The chicken was very dry and looked like it had been sitting around for a few hours. Also it lacked the flavor of the medium heat. The fries and greens were good. The tea was $5 for what equates to a small (they only have 1 size).  I left bummed out as it's been a minute since I've been to Nashville and was looking forward to some Hattie B's while in Vegas.  If you haven't been to their flagship locations you may dig this, if have been to their other locations you may be better off skipping it.",

Located in the new food court area at the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino, Hattie B delivers some of Nashville's famous Hot Chicken to Las Vegas. When I heard about this, I knew it would be a MUST on my next trip to Vegas.   Fortunately, it was this past weekend and wow was it amazing. The chicken was juicy, crispy, and perfectly flavored. For myself, I got the Large Dark and that was definitely a TON of food for 1 person. The anticipation worked up a big appetite, but I would say a Small size is reasonable for 1 person. It also comes with 2 sides (coleslaw, fries were awesome).   I enjoyed the dark meat, mild level of spiciness and the sides.   Things to know -  1. Limited seating, They have bar stools and some tables nearby. 2. Line can get long, but it also moves quickly. Don't get deterred.",

I got the small white plate, which comes with 1 breast and wing pieces, 2 slices of bread, sliced pickles, and 2 sides. For sides, I went with mac and cheese and fries. I also added a chicken tender. The chicken I got was too greasy and oily for my liking. It's bathed in melted hot spices to give it that signature Nashville kick, but I found it to be overwhelming. The wing and tender were juicy and moist, but the breast was on the dry side.  The bread was just plain white bread that you can get at any grocery store. No attempt was made to dress it up in any way. The mac and cheese has some pimento peppers in it to bring some heat to the dish.  I really liked their lemonade, and it was a blessing that refills are free and unlimited. You're definitely going to need plenty of liquid to cool down your taste buds from all the heat that the chicken's packing.",

The plates include two sides.   Simple right? No. You choose from four levels of heat. I like it spicy, however Vanessa, the effervescent cashier, provided me with the barometer of spice.   Medium. It's not! Deliciously kick'n, I broke a small sweat. On the extreme end is the ghost pepper infused batter. Blaze'n must be an honest description.  The leg and thighs were moist and full of flavor. Add one tender and it was a filling meal. The pieces come on top of a slice of white bread.   Cole slaw, crinkle fries, mac'n cheese, potato salad, and collard greens are your sides.   I opted to have my protein and carbs with the greens. Decent with a hint of tang. I should have asked if vinegar was available in the True Southern tradition it would have been perfect.   $18 with a soda pop was good deal. I think strawberry soda would have been great. Sweet/unsweetene tea and lemonade are your options.  I will be back before I leave to bring a whole chicken home. My kid would love it!",

As far as chicken goes, it is just okay for me too. I've had much better ones like Blue Ribbon, Yard Bird and unfortunately my family thinks even Popeye is better.   As far as the service goes, we got our food pretty quickly both times. That's a plus and how food court should be!",

Chicken Tenders Plate ($11): Three pieces of chicken tenders with a slice of white bread and choice of two sides - fries & pimento mac n cheese. The tenders had a good juicy consistency but were a little overly salted. The fries were standard but they didn't jip on the amount provided! Mac n cheese had a subtle pimento flavor but the pasta was too soft to where it was almost mushy. Overall, a solid three stars for the food.   Service was pretty good. The guy prepping the food was energetic and friendly. Note - only bottled water available for purchase.",

When they put their sauce and pickles in there, it's great. The pickles are nice to have something acidic in there to cut the rest of the chicken and sauce.   We got the fries to go with the sandwich and they're pretty good. Nice and crunchy- everything you want from a fry.

I decided to check it out since it was surrounded by other places like Eggslut, Milk bar, etc. (in case you decide not to eat there).  I came around 2pm on a weekend. There wasn't a long wait for me, but a big line started to form after I came. It was also the most packed compared to the 3 or 4 other little restaurants inside. I waited around 10 minutes for my fried chicken to come out, so it was not bad.  I ordered the small dark meat plate with fries and mac n cheese. The food came out fast, and the service was efficient. The food was soo filling! I shared it with one other person, and we were both stuffed. Even though it was just a small plate (for $9), I was full, so I can't imagine how the large plate is. The fries were really crispy, and the mac n cheese was cheesy and gooey. The fried chicken was also tender and crunchy. They provided a lot of fries and a good amount of mac n cheese. We were definitely starving before we ate it but came out stuffed afterwards.   The food, price, and service were all amazing. My overall experience was great, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone getting their fried chicken fix on.",

So we stumbled upon an this place that was located right across from Eggslut in the cosmopolitan hotel. There were like 5 other choices of food and we decided on this one and it was a great choice. So we decided to split the large dark meat, got fries and Mac and cheese for the sides. I am a wimp when it comes to spice so we got the mild (in my option still a little bit much for me but I still enjoyed it and ranch helped). The fries were the best, the Mac and cheese was rich and creamy, and the chicken was very very good. We throughly enjoyed our meal and we were very full afterwards.  We actually got really lucky because right after we ordered a line started to form and it got long (around 12:30). So I guess everyone else knows this place is good. The people were really nice and helpful. The cashier told us what we're good options, one of the cooks saw I was lost in looking for a tray and he gave it to me. It was just a nice experience. The eatery remind me of a Vegas version of \"grand central market\" in LA. So you have to find your seats anywhere there is a spot really. Most people are taking to go so there is a good amount of seating and options.   I also didn't know how popular this place was. I snap chatted my food and a friend was surprised I had this food. She knew exactly where it was from and she's wondering where I am so she could go back. Apparently it's a huge hit in Nashville. So if want a taste of Nashville in the heart of Vegas, this place is the bomb   Would I come here again? I'm grateful for this experience but there are so many other things to try (defiantly come at least once)",

    "text": "Solid option in the Food Haul that is reasonably price or dare I say cheaper option for being on the strip. Anyway, I had the original in Nash close to Vanderbilt and from my experience would be that the chicken here is up to bar in comparison to original. That is saying a lot considering how far out west Vegas is from Nash and at the time I tried them it had only been a few weeks they were open. The spices and texture of the breading were all on par, I was impressed how were they were able to replicate it. Since Vegas is a tourist town there are a lot of well known establishments such as Hattie B's that set up shop here in hopes of drawing those tourist crowds. With that being said they can sometimes be a hit or miss and Hattie B's is definitely a hit!",

We ordered the chicken tender combo in Damn Hot. It's the kind of spice that sneaks in on you and stay there after the first few bites. There's some kick to it but very enjoyable as we do like our spice. Chicken was juicy and delicious!  The mac and cheese as the side was one of the best we've ever had as it was very creamy and thick. We ordered it togo and still enjoyed it when we got back to our room 30+ minutes later. Definitely worth trying if you love hot chicken. There is a good amount of food for the price! Would definitely come back when we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "First and foremost, I did have VERY high expectations for this Chicken spot, the \"Hot Chicken\" is slated in its name.   I'm from Los Angeles and yes we have many renditions of the \"Hot Chicken\" and some of them are excellent, meanwhile some are just okay. Hattie B's Hot Chicken was on my list due to the overwhelming Yelp reviews I've seen. I have tried many chicken places and specifically I love Hot Chicken. Unfortunately, Hattie B's is not what it is reviewed to be, I simply do not understand the high ratings. Maybe people are just too drunk to know what's good?   The Chicken is 3/5 at best, a bit too chewy and not tender at all. The Batter/Seasoning is 0/5, how can you even use \"Hot Chicken\" when the flavor profiles is predominantly just salty and spicy (no flavor). I'm sorry this is the truth. The Comeback sauce is 3/5, can't really go wrong with this sauce anywhere but nothing special.  Sorry as someone who loves chicken and eats a lot of Hot Chicken, this place is simply a 1 star. If we are looking for a decent chicken sandwich, sure, why not, it's Vegas. But if you're looking for actual chicken pieces or tender, this place simply serves a 2/5 chicken. Don't expect too much",

Not bad at all for Strip food pricing.   The chicken was super tender and juicy. No dry pieces! Got the mild since I don't do spicy and it was delicious. Potato salad had the big chunky potato pieces, 4/5. Mac and Cheese had a slight heat to it, but it wasn't overpowering 5/5!  I can see how if it gets super busy the line could get long as well as seating issues - but I wouldn't mind getting this to bring up to my room.  Will definitely come back again!",

There was definitely a line for Hattie B's but honestly grew behind me as I stood in line. The line does go through pretty quickly since you are ordering with a cashier. Luckily Hattie B's doesn't have an overwhelming amount of options so people could decide pretty quickly what they wanted. I decided to get the Chicken Tenders( medium spice level) with french fries and mac-n-cheese. Lets just say I was satisfied. They definitely give you the right amount of food. The tenders were delicious and flavored to perfection. I love crinkle cut fries so that was a winner with its crispness! The mac-n-cheese was my favorite and I definitely loved the way they did it! It can be a very much a hit or miss at some restaurants for me but Hattie B's did it well! the sweet tea was perfect, but it is a bit pricey. But, go figure it is Las Vegas where everything is a bit much. You can get refills but they don't advertise it you just have to ask.

The sandwich came out pretty quickly, the staff was Friendly and helpful and portion was nice.  The chicken was extremely spicy and I'm one who very much enjoys heat but doesn't like when it overpowers the taste of the food. The bun was mediocre at best (on the hard side), the slaw and pickles were the best of the ingredients.   The chicken itself was extremely DRY, and really inedible. Taking bites and having to tear pieces out of your mouth because it was not chewable and dry af... this was a disaster in a bun!!  Next I had the mac and started out thinking it was at least pretty decent and semi enjoyable.  When nearing the end of the small side, I nearly puked finding a effin HAIR mixed into the mac and cheese.    As much as I wanted to enjoy this, it was a huge huge disappointment and I will without doubt, not return!  DISASTER!!",

The meat had so much flavor and the crispy skin had great crunch and texture. I was pleased.",

I got the tenders and chicken sandwich and it was incredible. I loved the sandwich more but the best part is that it's very reasonable to be located in the Casino. Only thing I didn't like was that my wait was a little too long compared to everybody else. Get the sandwich.",

A huge bird like this must've had tons of hormones to be this size. A chicken tasted good and it was well cooked. The place was loud playing rap music.   There was not a lot of southern side options. No corn bread no barbecue sauce and the usual sourhern options.",

The dark meat choice really is a quarter of a chicken that includes the back.  A dipping sauce comes with it but I say don't ruin the chicken with a sauce.  The chicken is served on top of a slice of white bread to absorb the oil.",

I kindly tipped them my weight in sunflower seeds and ate my meal in a booth with some strangers nearby. The spiked white drink was tasty.

All in all I liked it - it would have been nice to know that they don't have bbq sauce and they don't like to talk about it. They got kinda scared and quiet when I asked. No biggie tho just a little weird.",

As I received my order, I took a max of 3 bites and realize that this sandwich was nothing special. The Mac and cheese also tasted bland. I went back to counter to request a box to go. As I received my boxes, I quickly placed my food inside of it only to get reprimanded from one of the worker for utilizing the counter space. Da fuq? Howlin Rays and Chick-Fil-A would never!   If you want the best fried chicken in the world, go to Howlin Rays. If you want impeccable customer service, head elsewhere.",

She gave us -   -medium-heat bone in chicken breast/wing quarter, served on a slice of white bread -side of mac n cheese -side of cole slaw -sweetened ice tea  -CHICKEN- DELICIOUS. Seriously. So good. Crispy breading, perfect heat, juicy on the inside, incredible flavor! I forgot to grab blue cheese when I picked up the order, and honestly didn't even miss it.  I don't crave fried chicken very often, but I'm already craving it. It was that -I could go back today and happily and guiltlessly eat it again- good.  -MAC N CHEESE- It was fine, not the best I've had, but tasty.  -COLE SLAW- Perfectly refreshing with the spicy chicken. I'm not a huge fan of slaws, but the friend I brought loved it!  -ICED TEA- Good sweetened tea, smooth and fresh with no bitterness in the aftertaste.  Definitely recommend Hattie B's!",
