    "text": "We visited Giada's on the last day of our Vegas trip for lunch and was left a bit disappointed. I'm a huge fan and had some high expectations for the food there - maybe the dinner menu is better? My husband ordered a SLAT (smoked salmon and avocado) which was very heavy on the salmon but was \"eh, OK.\" I ordered a lemon pesto grilled cheese with prosciutto that was actually quite tasty though for $22 didn't blow me away. Our favorite item ended up being the drinks and appetizers - great bloody marys and the chefs board is always a solid choice. Luckily we had a Groupon to make our meal a bit better. On a side note- the restaurant itself is absolutely adorable. Sit by the window for a nice view of the strip and look at all the detail taken into consideration when decorating - even down to the silverwear and napkins. Next time we would probably just stick with apps and drinks.",

Our table was gorgeous, with a view of the Bellagio fountain.  Laurent went out of his way to come over and made sure everything was going well throughout the entire meal.  Our server was Erin, who was fantastic.  She gave us suggestions and was right about everything she offered as a suggestion.  We started out with the cured beef, which came with the most amazing pickled cherries.  Then we tried two different cheeses and the orzo meatball.  We split the ricotta pizza and finished up with the selection of cookies.  Everything was incredible and the dining experience was not to be outdone in the near future.  Not only was this meal that we will not forget, it is one that we will be taking about for a long time.",

The service was incredibly slow (think 30 mins to get a drink slow, 15 to get silverware so we could eat the food in front of us slow). The food was also just bland. Nothing to write home about. We had the tasting menu and the only thing that was remotely memorable was the pasta course. Unfortunately, the pasta was about 2oz and the tasting course is $120 a person. Definitely not worth a visit when there are so many outstanding restaurants on the strip!",

    "text": "Wow, what an amazing experience from top to bottom.  My wife is a huge Giada fan so said I needed to eat here on a recent work trip to Las Vegas.  I'm glad I took her word as it was a delicious meal.  The front staff wasn't super friendly or warm but after you got through the doors the experience changed.    I was by myself but they gave me a phenomenal seat right along the window.  I was lucky enough to see Giada there too as she came out to speak with the table next to me.  I started off with a cocktail and had to try the tasting menu after the waiter described it to me.  Plus I was able to bring home an autographed photo of Giada for my wife.  Be prepared because the tasting menu is massive so you better be hungry.  They first brought out the bread plate which was awesome and the lemon butter made it that much better.  The tasting menu started off with bacon wrapped dates, a stuffed pepper with cheese and Vitello Tonnato crostini.  All were delicious but I loved the dates and I'm not a huge date fan.  For the second course I had the super tasty lemon spaghetti with two of the most massive shrimp I've ever seen.  For the third course I got the roasted lamb which was good and the mustard crust made the meal.  For dessert you got to choose from 5 which was too much.  I had the strawberry gelato (yum), a strawberry tart, lemon ricotta cookie, amaretti cookie, and my favorite the blueberry tiny donut.  Excellent job Giada!",

So many strip restaurants are dark and heavy feeling. Not so here. Good martini as well. Fully recommended.",

    "text": "Oh Giada... Your restaurant could have not been prettier. Right away when you walk in her decor is super cute and clean. Anyways I do not want to make this long so let me get to the point. We got seated right away and lucky for us we had a table right next to the window. Our bread came out and I loved the butter mixed with mascarpone cheese and also the pesto. Our server was foreign and at first I thought he was a little rude but he turned out to be great! The boyfriend had the orzo meatballs which were okay. Then for our entree I had the Lemon spaghetti with prawns and the lobster ravioli. Let me just say that the lemon spaghetti was beyond amazing. So simple yet so delicious. I cannot stop thinking about it. The ravioli was really buttery and had a hint of lemon which was really good as well. Even tho the portions were small I got full and had to take half of the ravioli to go. My boyfriend order the surf n turf. The steak was nicely cooked and he loved the prawns. Only thing he did not like was some pasta that was on his plate that was really salty and had a weird flavored to it. Anyways it was dessert time. I had a nutella latte, paired with Giadas famous Lemon Ricotta cookies and her chocolate chip one. Ugh they were so good! At first I was really scare because of all the mix reviews on yelp to try this place but I am glad I had a great experience. I feel sorry for all those who did not. And yes the price was a little higher but you are paying for the whole experience not just the food, keep that in mind.",

    "text": "Ok, let's get the one thing out of the way. It can be pricey, but that's what is expected with a well know chef and being on the strip. That said, there are some nice differences that make Giada rise to the top versus the rest!  First, the location is on the second floor of the new Cromwell casino an elegant boutique casino that sits in the corner of Flamingo and the strip. Well, if your looking for a good view point Giada is on that corner on the second floor!  Atmosphere starts from the escalator that moves you to the elegant reception area with comfortable seating area an then, yes my favorite a photo booth! We all hate the wait to be seated area where people stand and look at each other annoyingly until someone calls your mispronounced name within what is hopeful, an hr later. Well, this place is cool and using the photo booth with your friends and family while you wait is lot better and it's free!  Service starts immediately with eager receptionist waiting to attend to you. However, the popularity and packed reservation gives them the little shortness in their attitude. Too much to go on in the decor and the design but it's very nicely sat with feminine, clean, yet elegant but not too over the top. For me, I like the clean feeling as you walk in the dining area.  Food, let's just put a spot light on this right now! It's darn good! Best description is, simple, beautiful, and taste that will pleasantly surprise you. Never knew how wonderful a simple meat ball will taste or squash strings that you'll swear it's the best shoe string fries you ever had. Let's just say it's not your typical fill me up place littered on the strip to fulfill your hunger from night after drink binging. Plus, putting your famous name on something doesn't mean it's gonna be any good like manny celebrity filled over priced places on the strip. Yes, Giada puts her name on it but the significant difference is everything. Finally, she is there quite frequently to oversee every corner of the operations from the kitchen to her customers. Ya, she actually spends lots of time in the dining area and genuine like your the guest over her house.   Spent some time on this review for sure but it deserves the attention from my perspective..!",

But today was just beyond bad. If your going to be a server you just gotta take the good with the bad. I literally sat at the bar for 20 minutes waiting on Katie to take my order while she made drinks or the table servers and checked on the couple that was sitting directly next me to lol. I swear to god I thought for a second I was being punked.  This threw my whole vibe off. Now off to my room to meditate so I can get my good energy back. ",

He's been wanting to come since I told him how great my first experience was.  I was able to get a reservation for two online.  I felt lucky cause it's really hard to get a table here.  You have to really book way in advance.   We ordered the following as appetizers: grilled octopus,  anchovies over toasts and oysters. Everything was delicious; however,  we were a little disappointed with the oysters because it wasn't fresh. One was still frozen which was unexpected at a restaurant of this quality.   For the entree, we ordered the spaghetti with shrimp, lemon and basil and the farrotto with creamy porcini mushrooms, brussels sprout leaves, pomegranate and pecorino tartufo. Both were absolutely delicious even though the farrotto was a bit rich.  All in all,  we would come again but probably won't order the oysters unless it was cooked like an oyster rockefeller.  Make sure to rsvp in advance. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My first trip. Located on second floor of the Cromwell.   Tips. This place takes reservations. Most dinner times of 5-9 are a two month out for a reservation. Lunch recently began to be served. Lunch dress code is relaxed and dinner is business casual. Dress code is enforced.  Experience. At arrival we are greeted immediately at the base of stairs to confirm our lunch reservation. Also confirmed and greeted at the front desk. She kindly informs us to wait a few moments to try the photo booth to the left and are escorted to our tables.  Our server Anthony arrived in a timely manner to introduce himself and his help. He was kindly insured we placed a drink order. We were unsure on what to order and he described some of his favorite beverage choices. Giada's Sangria with Brachetto and Fortunella 1958 with Don Julio were the drinks we ordered. Anthony kindly informed us that restaurant was out of Don Juilo and was substituting with Patron. Rare to find a restaurant out of beverage. Without Don Julio I went with my second choice Barbarella 1968 with Tanqueray Ten. Waiter respected and agreed with my opinion and affirmed the second choice was his favorite drink.   Drinks were served and food order was taken without delay. Both drinks I would describe as a good balance with alcohol and freshly matched ingredients. Sangria was crisp and savory. Barbarella similar to a Moscow Mule was harmony of gin, ginger beer, fresh lemon and basil. Drinks ordered were refreshing for the hot temperatures outside of the restaurant. Alcohol was not over powering either.   Anthony made suggestions for the meal. We followed some suggestions and ordered others. We ordered appetizers from the antipasti meat and cheese including Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Pecorino Tartufo with Apricot Preserves served with fresh made flat bread and dipping sauce. Dipping sauce similar to that of a pesto. Yum. Pairing flat bread with pecorino and apricot spread just magnificent. The components of pecorino worked well on its own and together. Harmony.   Meatballs paired with vine roasted tomatoes in a savory Marsala. Tender soft meatballs. Sauce was flavorful and one of the best I had. Tomatoes lightly toasted to maintain it's integrity. As a whole this was a nice antipasti. Pieces were good on its own but in my opinion lacked a little cohesion for the appetizer. This item is on their dinner menu and I would still order it.   We ordered from the sandwiches from servers suggestions. Muffuletta sandwich with mortadella, finocchoina, porchetta, prosciutto cotto, and aged provolone. Similar to an Italian salumi trio, was bursting with spice and fair amount of provolone on a fresh rustic bread. Prepared warm from the grill, this is what a  sandwich should be. This sandwich pays True homage to the influences of Giada's family into the restaurant. Sandwich is served with choice of arugula salad or zucchini scapecce. Arugula salad was elected to pair with this. Lightly dressed and topped with parmesan that hit an accord with the sandwich. I couldn't complain if this was the only thing I ordered. Between the muffuletta sandwich and arugula salad I think I could eat all day without feeling guilty.  Other sandwich was the Lobster Roll with lemon basil aioli and fried capers. The roll was by far one of the best deals on the menu. Ten ounces of lobster piled on a roll with the citrus aioli was succulent, creamy, savory, and sweet. Nothing over powering just right and not too aromatic with the lobster and citrus. Paired this with the zucchini scapecce like a zucchini onion strings. Not greasy but crispy enough with flavor to enjoy on it's own or pair with the lobster roll. Lightness of the zucchini paired nicely to the sandwich. Both light sides were good pairings.   Overall the appetizers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks were great. Service was outstanding. Restaurant as a whole was refreshing, exceeded the expectations and hype. The restaurant reflects the pride, tradition which tributes to Giada's family and California influences. I would make sure I had a reservation the next time I am out to Las Vegas. A must try if you like food.   Server was very personal and knowledgeable of menu. Server was efficient, friendly, and well articulated. It showed with suggestions. We enjoyed the meal from some suggestions he made and our own selections. Serve, wait, and host staff worked well like a oiled machine or an orchestra on key.  Overall four stars for exceptions from a slight delay on the check to get to us, a little pricy, and no clue what lunch was because lunch menu (just started serving lunch) was not available until we ate there. Five stars on food, service, and drinks.   We had plenty on our list of things to do for this Vegas trip and this is a definite return place for us.",

    "text": "Upon arrival my friend and I had trouble getting into the restaurant.  The first set of hostess, which are downstairs before going up the escalators wouldn't let us inside because we did not have reservations.  We had called before arriving to ensure we were able to sit in bar/lounge area w/out reservations and were told that we could.  After politely speaking w/ the manager we were able to resolve the issue and get seated.  Once inside the night seemed to flow perfectly.  The inside of the restaurant is very classy and elegant w/ nice neutral colors, beautiful art work, and big open windows w/ a great view of the Bellagio Fountains...I LOVED IT!  The service was first class and everyone including the manager greeted and treated us very well.  In particular, our bartender, Martin, was very friendly and attentive.   We started the night w/ a special blood orange \"mocktail\" and it was very sweet and refreshing!   First was a warm and delicate Artichoke Soup w/ Cruton and Homemade Focaccia Bread.  I was tempted to keep eating it!  Second we had a Mushroom Pizette and White Anchovies Caesar w/ Germolata Butter Crostini; both were perfect savory bites.   Third was the Lobster Ravioli w/ Asparagus Tips, Tarragon and Lemon Sauce...my favorite!  They were like light, airy pillows of fresh homemade pasta and I couldn't get enough!  However, I had to save room for my sweet tooth and most favorite thing of all...DESSERT!  For dessert we got the Trio of Tiramisu - Blackberry, Chocolate and PB & J along w/ assorted cookies (2 of each) that included Warm Chocolate Chip, Sugared Chocolate, Mini Palmers and Lemon Ricotta (My Favorite)!  To end the night we were lucky enough to meet Giada.  My friend and I were so excited since we're such big fans!  She is the sweetest person and besides taking pictures she signed my \"Feel Good Food\" book...it was such an honor to meet her!  The biggest thing to stress is give her some space and have patience...it's tough getting her attention, especially when she's slaving away in the kitchen and making sure things are going well in her restaurant.    What an Amazing Dinner!  My new favorite in Vegas and I can't wait to go back w/ my husband when he returns from Afghanistan!",

    "text": "I went to Giada's on Saturday night with a friend and thought it was good.  We ordered the artichoke with the hummus inside which was probably the least favorite thing we ordered.   For the main course we split the salmon and spaghetti with prawns and thought both were extremely delicious and the portions were a good size and absolutely made me full.  The downfall was our waiter, he was a little bit awkward, asking us many times if we wanted a drink which we finally told him after the 3rd time that we are not drinking right now.  The atmosphere was really nice and was right next to Drais which was nice because that's where we were going after.   Overall, I thought the main course was really delicious and I would eat there again.",

We wanted to fully enjoy our experience and take in the amazing ambiance and view of that Las Vegas strip anyway. We were promptly greeted at the bar and whisked away to one of the best tables in the house, in our opinion, right along the windows over looking the bellagio fountains and Caesars palace. Nancy, our server greeted up right away with the most welcoming smile and guided us through the menu options. We of course had to choose the tasting menu as requested by our fabulous knowledgeable server, Nancy. Not one item left us disappointed! The food, drinks, wine, dessert (that dessert cart is no joke!), atmosphere and of course Nancy who guided our entire experience was impeccable. If you're in Las Vegas visiting or as a resident you have to stop in, you won't be disappointed unless you miss out on this one of a kind dining experience! Thanks Nancy, you're AMAZING!!!!",

My friends and I ordered bottomless mimosas since it was around brunch time when we got there, and it's 30$ for bottomless. Also, the level of service was excellent since the servers are very tentative and also made sure our glasses of champagne were always full with just a splash of orange juice lol. The food was pretty good too. But overall I loved the ambiance of the restaurant and the great view! Will definitely come Back when I'm in Vegas again next time!",

    "text": "This was my first time at Giada.  I've seen her shows on the Food Network and was very curious what her food tastes like at her restaurant.  Because she's a celebrity chef, I fully expected prices to be on the expensive side, but I also expected food to taste great.  The bread course was a promising start.  The olive loaf and the rosemary bread were delicious, along with the accompanying butter and pesto dip.  We inhaled the bread course.  Unfortunately, the main course was a huge disappointment.  I love Cacio e Pepe, and have had this dish at other restaurants in Los Angeles.  I was curious to see how Giada's Cacio e Pepe would compare to those I've had before.  It was a pretty expensive dish at $64, as it is only portioned for two people and served on a cheese bowl.  When the dish arrived, it was inedible.  There was too much pepper.  The pasta was so peppery, we couldn't have more than a couple bites, and my husband actually went to the restroom as his food was coming back up.  I don't know if this was a fluke, an error, but I can't know how anyone could finish this dish, let alone enjoy it.    Gratefully, our server noticed that we weren't enjoying the dish we ordered, and volunteered to take the dish back and offered us a replacement dish.  Given that our dish of choice was a huge error, we asked our server for her recommendation, and she offered the lobster ravioli as one of her personal favorites, and a popular favorite as well.  She also gave my husband a complimentary ginger beer concoction from the bar to help settle his stomach.  That was really nice of her, so I truly appreciate her attentive and friendly service.  Kudos to our server.  When the lobster ravioli came out, it tasted okay.  It wasn't anything spectacular to justify the $34 price tag.  But again, I was expecting premium prices just for Giada's name.  The lobster was tender and cooked well, the sauce was buttery but maybe a tad too lemony for my taste.  But the most egregious error is that the ravioli was under-cooked.  I know pasta should be al dente, but this was under-cooked and tough.  And for an Italian restaurant named after an Italian celebrity chef, pasta is something they should know how to do right.  Though I didn't originally plan to order dessert, the peppery taste from the Cacio e Pepe was still lingering in my mouth, so I felt like I needed something sweet.  I tried Giada's raspberry ricotta cheesecake.  The texture of the cheesecake was good, and it wasn't too sweet, which I appreciated.  The cheesecake goes well with the fresh raspberry and citrus sauces that came with it.  However, there were some candied orange peel mixed into the cheesecake as well, which I could have done without.  Maybe some people like that, but it was a pretty bold flavor that stood out too much on the otherwise mellow & delicate flavor of the cheesecake.  It reminded me too much of fruitcake instead of cheesecake.  So overall, I can't really say that I recommend this restaurant.",

We ordered the arrugala salad, roasted chicken with cacciatore dipping sauce  and jumbo shrimp.  The chicken dish was flavorful along a side of cacciatore marinara.  But nothing impressive. The salad came with a lemon vinaigrette and parmigiano reggiano shavings and was quite tasty. My date had the jumbo shrimp and he liked it.  I had a cosmopolitan made with fresh grapefruit juice I believe. I've had better.  All orders came with fresh bread along with dipping sauces.  Located inside The Cromwell (a lovely hotel btw), it offers breakfast, lunch and dinner.     I'm sure there are better Italian restaurants but I guess if your a fan of Giadia then its a destination on your list.",

We had reservation, but we had one more guest to our party, so we informed the hostess that it was a party of 5 vs 4.  They took over 10 minutes to add one more place setting to our booth.  So not a good start, but when we walked in the restaurant, it had a nice view and we were hopeful.   Our main server was pleasant but her \"helper\" was having a bad day.  She was grumpy and we had to keep asking for coffee refills (it didn't help she only filled it half way every time!).  Now to the food!  Only 3 of us ordered the tasting menu.  So they brought out one pastry per person, slices of salami and plate of salad and said that was for 3 people.  The food was okay, nothing special.  Then entrees..2 of us ordered Salmon Benedict and one order the Burger.  the food was blah....meh...and as someone else mentioned in previous review, the tasting menu is not a good deal if you look the entree prices on the menu.    Dessert was ok.  My son ordered a pasta dish with chicken and he says the chicken tasted like \"cancer\" meaning he can taste the burnt char taste from the grill.  And the pesto type pasta dish was so bland, my pasta dish at home is far superior and I'm not even a chef let alone a celebrity chef.  Even with the Groupon \"Deal\" this brunch was complete waste of money!!!  If you are looking for a tasty Italian style brunch, go to Buddy's at the Venetian.  Far superior food quality and you don't need a Groupon deal!!!  Yes, we tipped 20% off the full price tasting menu of $55 instead of the Groupon price.  Because its not the server's fault the food is so Meh...Blah...",

Light and fluffy with just a little crunch from the polenta. And it came with Nutella which of course made it better! Overall wasn't too expensive either for the strip. About $30/person with drinks and an appetizer.  And don't miss the free photobooth just at the top of the escalator near the entrance!!",

We did a Yelp check-in for a taste of Prosecco which was a half glass!  We really enjoyed the Prosecco with the complimentary rosemary  bread and items to put on the bread such as Capers butter salt peppers...it was a really nice touch. Our waiter was excellent...

And my review is not based on one visit but now 2 visits where service was poor each time. However, this last visit that Management referring to was the icing on the cake.   I came with a party of 3 and mentioned upon being seated we had a travel zoo promo we were looking to use. The waiter already gave us a ton of hesitation and said he'd be back to check on the voucher details. Came back, and told us we needed to be a party of 4 to use that voucher but we could speak with management about any exceptions. We've used a plethora of these type of vouchers all up and down the strip and this is the first time anyone's said anything. So we were like sure, Mina came over and without introducing herself strait away said we wouldn't use it but we could purchase the travel zoo for the party of 2 and use that one. We explained that we were going to order plenty of food and wine and didn't understand what the difference was and she cited it was a travel zoo policy, which is unTrue and/or she's misinformed. It's manager's discretion... everyone knows that.   So we left, mainly because by the time Mina got there we'd already had to deal with at least 3 other people who are terrible at their jobs and weren't about to deal with one more. We hoped over to BLT and used their travel zoo, which states it's for 4 people, and the staff there were happy to have us, we could use it on anything with no stipulations. We ordered a few bottles of wine, had incredible steaks and a great waiter. No drama and no BS.   Giada's only looks nice, other than that it's mediocre food and the crappiest service on the strip. No thanks, wouldn't be back if you paid me.",

    "text": "We ordered the tricolore salad for starters and the chef was nice enough to split the plate.  Salads are always my favorite to start off a glutenous meal.  See the variety of ingredients in the salad in my pictuures?  As a meat lover the prosciutto was melt in my mouth with a nice serving of gorgonzola to make this meal really promising.    I ordered the crudo oysters and my husband was a fan.  Smaller in size, already cleaned and placed back in the half shell for our enjoyment.  Semi sweet, not too much of the ocean taste, which is a good thing.    We had the salume pizza, about the size of a personal pizza.  I wish it would have been crisped up more, but it was popping with flavor.  You can't mess that one up, but good dough and good seasoning makes this a popular dish to share.    My husband enjoyed the bucatini, but I thought this pasta dish was way too spicy for it's own good.  Topped with ricotta, I thought it was the saving grace for this dish.  We were forewarned, but it's definitely not my favorite dish.  For my main dish, I went with the salmon.  The buttery rich fatty goodness was the highlight of my meal.  My husband went with the surf and turf and all were cooked to perfection.    Just shy of $180, I thought it was a much better deal than what they offered for their tasting menu.  I'm not a fan when I can't really switch out the set tasting menu.  Some things just sound less enticing than the rest of the choices.   Overall, I'm still a fan.  Eat a little bit of everything is Giada's motto.  The only reason why we're here is for our special anniversary.  The view is amazing when the sun is setting.  I think Giada lucked out with this prime location in the Cromwell hotel.",

    "text": "I have been watching Giada on Food Network ever since I was a young teenager (over a decade now!).  I love her show, recipes, and products.  Basically, I'm a HUGE Giada fan.  When I arrived in Las Vegas for work, I knew that I had to try out Giada's restaurant.  I had huge expectations and was preparing myself to be WOWed.  Giada is located in the Cromwell, right when you go up the escalator.  It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of fanciness.  I had The Giada cocktail and a porchetta and spinach mini pizza.  The cocktail was delicious and the mini pizza was tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.    I originally was planning to order something more, but the service here is just annoying.  I only got a light snack because I don't like eating full on meals at bars.  I asked the hostess if I could get a table, but she said that since I was alone, I HAD to sit at the bar.  She was a huge grump and no smile or welcome at all.  If she had said something along the lines of they can't give me a table due to not having a reservation, fine.  But she literally said, \"Since you're alone, you can ONLY sit at the bar.\"  Really?  That's odd to me.   The bartender was fine, but not friendly at all.  The atmosphere here is way too pretentious.  The hostess left a very sour taste in my mouth before I even was seated.    Despite my admiration of Giada, would I come back?  Nope.  There are far too many delicious places with excellent service on the Strip, so why deal with young snooty pretentious girls?",

Service was a little slow from the actual waiter, but major props to the support staff who were on top of water refills, clearing plates, etc.   The food was okay, but nothing to get excited about. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant because I think there are similarly priced options with better food. We started off with the fritto misto (over seasoned) and the meatballs (under seasoned). Their antipasti menu is vast and I would probably just make a meal out of items on this menu if I go back. The table next to us ordered cheese, salumi, pizzettes and it looked good.  For entrees we ordered the crab and scallop risotto and pea pesto tortellini. My friend liked the risotto but I was underwhelmed by the tortellini. The sauce was too lemony and I got no hint of tortellini filling or pesto. Bummer!   If you're a fan of Giada's it's worth checking out once, but go in with low expectations!",

Will have to leave room for the build your own brownie cart!  The photo booth was a great touch.  Our reservation was an hour before they closed lunch.  We felt slightly rushed, our waiter was setting up tables for dinner so maybe was not as attentive as we recvd the wrong meatballs as ordered, recvd cappuccino after we finished our dessert and they completely forgot about the lemon ricotta cookies we inquired about.  Most were corrected but just a minor downfall to the experience.  I still would recommend as the overall experience was great.",

The food was absolutely delicious. We tried the pastry platter (polenta muffin, rosemary scone, chocolate croissant monkey bread, and blueberry cheese Danish), cavatelli, romaine salad, and sunrise polenta waffle without pancetta. I can say with absolute certainty that every bite we ate was scrumptious. They even made a simple romaine salad bright and yummy, with citrus dressing and fried capers. At the end of our meal we were provided with a lemon cookie and a chocolate peanut butter cookie with blueberry jam in the center. Both were also delicious. The ambiance was great. Our booth was surprisingly comfortable with an amazing view of the strip. Look up! The ceiling fans are pretty neat. Don't miss the photo booth outside by the host / hostess stand!",

We shared the antipasti platter and a romaine salad to start. For dinner we had a filet, fried Brussels sprouts and an order of spaghetti. All of the food was wonderful, but the portions were a bit small for the price. I also think we are just use to American size entrees...not what is actually served in Europe.

The bad side is the loud club type music, totally ruins the Italian fine (or even casual) dining experience.   The food, on the good side, presentation in all dishes was amazing.  The pasta was fresh, well cooked.  The bad, which was not bad it was just OK, 4 separate appetizers and none with a wow by any means.  Missing small stuff, no black napkins, plates so over used marks on them. For the price, worth dessert for the view but that's about it",

Decor of the restaurant is cute, service is excellent, but the food was beyond disappointing.  Everything we ordered was bland and the flavors were boring. I love italian and traveling to Italy for the cuisine especially are some of my favorite trips -- Giada does italian food such an injustice at this restaurant that it truly makes me wonder how this can be her speciality.   Between the four of us, we ordered a number of dishes to get a True sampling of the menu:  - Wood Fired Mushrooms: Meh. I love mushrooms but there was really no seasoning or taste beyond the natural taste of the mushrooms.  - Eggplant Parmigiana: Recommended by our server. Not terrible, not great, not really memorable. - Parmigiano Reggiano: My favorite dish. Simple cheese with wild sage honey.  - Salmon: Nicely cooked and flakey. Seasoning was okay as well, not spectacular but enjoyable. - 7 oz Filet: $60 of MEH. So unimpressive, bland, and boring. Everyone that tasted a bite of the filet had the same opinion --  disappointing. - Rigatoni: Interesting composition, not as flavorful as I was expecting but in a table of bland dishes, this still stood out as having a little oomph. Interesting take on vegetarian bolognese.  - Spagetti: Giada's specialty dish... should be taken off the menu and never served again to keep any self respect for this restaurant. THIS IS HER SPECIALTY! Dry, bland, and tasted like the pasta you cook at home after it has been in the fridge all night and the pasta soaks up the entire sauce and is left dry and blah. The lemon and basil in the spagetti were difficult to detect at all, the huge shrimp were pretty to look at but also lacked any seasoning. I mean seriously?! - Lemon Potatoes: nothing special. - Roasted Broccolini: i love broccolini and this was just that...basic broccolini with nothing to give it any pizzazz.   At about $300 for dinner, the worst offenders were the steak and the spagetti -- essentially dishes totaling $100 that left me realizing I would likely never return to Giada's. The service on the other hand was friendly, courteous, and on top of it. If only the food was up to par with the classy feel of the restaurant and staff. What a disappointment.",

    "text": "One star? Well, when the restaurant is as expensive as Giada's, there is no room for error. I remember when this restaurant first opened and it was amazing. The food was fresh and it was delicious and it was literally perfect. My favorite dish has always been the rack of lamb. To be specific, I have been to the restaurant nine times and have had it seven times! The last time that I was there, it was just OK. This time, today, it was a disaster! Is there a new chef? Am I missing something? We started with the Verdure antipasto: medium size for $49. It is mainly vegetables in different combinations. It also contains olives. It was good. The initial bread that came out was OK yet, as usual, very oily. My friend ordered the yellow tomato soup which had a very tiny amount of soup but was OK to taste. She went ahead and ordered the seafood lasagna and said that it was absolutely disappointing as the seafood was overcooked. She is a seafood fanatic so if anyone knows proper seafood, she is definitely at the top of her game. She was disappointed and said she would never get the dish again. As for me, I ordered the rack of lamb. I ordered it medium and it was practically medium raw. The worst part is that it looked like it was rotting as it was breaking down off the bones with a lot of fat on it and just very unattractive and unappealing to the pallet. It looked old like it was wasting away rather than fresh delicious lamb that is properly cooked. To make it worse, there was this cold quinoa concoction along with it that was just disgusting. Cold quinoa with warm lamb??? Not to mention, again, the lamb was terrible. $54 for a dish that was as good as a bad dish that was $25.00 at a Denny's or Fridays. The bill, and we had no alcohol, came out to $160. No dessert either! When the prices this high, the quality better be phenomenal... It was anything but phenomenal. I am so disappointed in this restaurant and will not be coming back. I contemplated, as did my friend, calling the manager over to tell them how bad the meal was, but we were not looking for a free meal. We also did not want to make a scene. Quite frankly, my thoughts on it I don't want to restaurant is this expensive, there is absolutely no room for error. Today, huge errors were made. This restaurant is no longer worth the money that it charges and I would not recommend it at all. Unfortunately, this restaurant was a very poor presentation of the chef it represents. I will say that the service was nice. We had a very nice waiter and I felt bad because it was obvious to him that I did not really touch a lot of my rack of lamb but I was not saying anything and I think he was trying to be polite as well. Therefore, no complaints about service. I have lots of complaints about the quality of the food and the price associated with it. Therefore, not recommended.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try out Giada because of the previous reviews and pictures I had viewed on Yelp and because of Giada's reputation in the culinary world (I just love her!) However, I was not overly impressed with my overall experience when I dined here for breakfast a couple of weeks ago.  I made a reservation for 2 people on a Sunday morning, so when I showed up right on time, I was surprised they weren't able to seat us right away since we were one of the first tables there. They told us it would be about a 5-10 minute wait... I would have understood this if they were just waiting for their full wait staff to show up for the morning shift, however they kept seating other tables before us that had actually arrived after us. After about 20 minutes of waiting around, I finally went back to the hostess stand to ask what the scoop was, and she rushed around a little bit to finally get us seated.  The restaurant decor was absolutely beautiful though, with so many \"Giada\" details throughout the space. Giada signature tableware and even Giada signature cappuccino cups and saucers. These little touches were great.  The service was extremely slow. Our server would disappear forever before we could track her down to order more items. Wasn't my favorite.   We started with the Breakfast Pastry Assortment... $15 and not really worth it. There were maybe 2 items out of the 5 or so that I actually liked. Our entrees were good though; I went with the Italian Hash:  potatoes, bacon,  salami, peppers, tomato, onion with sunny side up eggs & toast. Felt like a cleaner version of \"hash\" compared to what I am used to in Texas. This plate was $19...  kind of expensive for a breakfast item... but then again, this is Vegas. My boyfriend had the American Breakfast, which was fine... nothing special. So for some lackluster pastries, two entrees, two coffees, and 1 over-priced mimosa, the final bill for breakfast came out to $100 after tip.   Not sure I would suggest this spot to anyone. Happy I tried it, but doubt I will ever be back. Sorry Giada :(",

    "text": "We had dinner here.  Didn't make a reservation but we were able to sit in the bar area almost immediately.  Right away you can see that this place is all about quality.  You can see the hand made noodles hanging in the kitchen as well as fresh rolls of Rosemary focaccia coming out of the oven.  We started with the Bucatini which my husband and I both agreed was the best pasta dish we ever had!  It was just cooked perfectly al dente and the flavors were just incredible!  It's a must order!    Next we had the whole roasted chicken (for 2).  It said on the menu \"as featured in Food and Wine magazine\".  This was one of the reasons why we came here.  Well the chicken looked and tasted amazing but when we started spooning the cacciatore sauce on it we started noticing that there were pieces of pork in it.  We quickly checked the recipe from the magazine and it didn't list any pork.  (I should also mention that my husband and I don't eat pork products).  We asked the waiter and the manager about it and they were both confused.  Turned out that the kitchen just recently started adding the pork.  Well then, don't print \"as featured in Food and Wine magazine\" because they also have the recipe with the article.  They felt so bad that that they gave us a dessert on the house.  We chose a leaning tower of chocolate and espresso gelatos.  It was like a cheesecake made of the different flavored gelatos and then they made it leaning as part of the presentation.  It was pretty amazing!  Overall, I thought this place was great!  Even though the sauce for the chicken was messed up, the chicken itself and the bucatini were just fantastic!",

And would give there suggestions as per you palate. We had meat and cheese platter and veg platter. The meat platter had prosciutto wine cooked beef chesse of different type. The mozzarella chesse just melted in my mouth the moment I ate it. And for main course I had lobster with side of zucchini. The bread was loaded with lobster meat cooked inside a bag put in boiling water. So the lobster is cooked in it's own juice. The bread was crisp even after 20 minutes of serving. And the way lobster and bread mix in the mouth is like mesmerising  jazz happening performance happening. And yes most of the desserts are freshly made on order. So don't miss it I recommend this place whenever you visit Vegas as a must to visit",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I went here Saturday evening for our 1 year anniversary. Beautiful restaurant, very classy & elegant, great decor. When making reservations I requested a table by the front window so we could have a view of the strip. I was told we wouldn't be guaranteed that unless we spend $100+ but they would still mark it down as requested. We ended up getting a window seat but it was towards the back where the shutters cover most of the window so we didn't really have a view. Didn't think we would spend over $100 but we did so we should've just guaranteed the spending of $100 when making the reservations & maybe gotten a better view.  There's a free photo booth in the waiting area which I thought was cute & a nice touch.   Service was a little slow. We weren't in any hurry but I felt it drag a little bit. We were treated very nicely.  Pricey. Food was very good. Heavy but small portions. I got the rigatoni & my boyfriend got the spaghetti which came with the biggest shrimp I'd ever seen/had! Both dishes were very good & again different than your traditional spaghetti & rigatoni.  When making the reservations I told them it was our anniversary & for dessert they brought us a cute dish with 2 of Giada's famous cookies, lemon & chocolate with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate. Very cute! (Lemon cookie was delish!)  I will be going back again because I'd like to try the brunch menu.",

    "text": "Finally ate at Giada's with family.  Food: Tasted good, but not great. There was simply not enough seasoning. The food presentation was excellent. The Risotto was flawless (minus the 100 peas). However, they add 2.8 thousand peas to everything. When a manager asked how we liked the food, I mentioned the excessive amount of peas included in every portion. He responded \"That's the number one complaint we receive, but we're working on it\". I thought to myself, \"how hard can it be to reduce the number of peas?\" The Tuna, was great but the scallops that each of us received were undercooked quite a bit. The lemon potatoes were very dry and management thought they were just not hot enough. So the manager brought out a new batch of lemon potatoes even though we had a full bowl of them still sitting on the table and,,, we were in the middle of eating dessert. He had a good heart though.   View: Spectacular  Dessert: it looked great but had very little flavor to it. I searched for the taste of sugar throughout. There was just a hint of that ingredient.   Overall: We won't eat there again. We simply expected great tasting food and that didn't happen. Compared to Hell's Kitchen and other restaurants, Giada, missed the mark overall.",

In addition to the tardiness, our company was sat in the bar area which was a huge letdown. The seating didn't feel formal at all. Our server was horrible but his assistant server was wonderful. He did everything he could to mend the horrible service we received with the main server. The manager also tried to help and did an excellent job but it was pretty much over by the end of it.  The food: Steak was excellent, most dishes were average in flavor but he fish and Cacio de pepe were horrible in flavor, texture and overall quality. Very disappointing considering all the choices in Vegas.",

Cacio e Pepe Bucatini - the presentation was nice. The flavor lacked.  Sweet corn & spicy sausage (side dish) was the best thing on the menu. But - it is a side dish.  Please, remove Ravioli from your menu. Mediocre at best. Over zested and not very good. Barely palatable.   The veal was pretty good. When you mask everything with too much cheese, it is just OK.   For the price - I could have eaten anywhere else in Vegas and should have. A beautiful restaurant but the food was just OK.   I will have to say - the \"celebrity chef\" thing is a bit overrated.",

Lovely decor, a unique photo booth, super cute napkins, plates, silverware, glasses, a 'G' symbol on desserts, nice touches & the windows surrounding the dining area open out to the strip.  New Years Eve of the Caesar's fireworks... fabulous!  28oz Bone In Tuscan Rib-Eye w/ a sunny side up egg & the Milanese Style Veal Saltimbocca are the best menu items.  (Sinatra's is the best for Veal fyi)  A glass of wine paired w/ Cheese, Salumi & Honey Board is truly what I recommend.  Enjoy the ambience w/ Parmigiana-Reggiano, Wild Sage or Raw Pear Honey & Bresaola, served w/ Apple, mustard & bread, yum.   Why one star? The Sausage Pizzetta was undercooked & tasteless.   The Mushroom Arancini's are not creamy melt-in-your-mouth like they look on her show. They serve & recommend the Caponata, which is like a mushy ratatouille w/ everything.  Why?  I think they even put it on the Muffuletta, which ruins a picture worthy sandwich.  If you get it ask for none of that, whatever the binder is.  Mayo would be better.   Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese w/ Heirloom Tomatoes, ok, not memorable to order again.   Pork ragout Pappardelle, I don't think is on the menu anymore, it was over cooked. Tiramisu comes in a cute espresso cup w/ hazelnuts & a powdered 'G' on it.  Perfect size since I can't eat a whole tiramisu.  It's creamier than tasting the lady fingers texture that I really like about tiramisu. The Bacon Rosemary Muffins look good & some breakfast items do to.    Over five trips to Giada's for lunch, dinner & disappointed more than half of those times so I'd say cheese & wine only!  All of my meals were comp'd w/ my Total Rewards card.  I have given this restaurant many chances cause I was in disbelief.  And the few items that are good, are not worth coming back for because someone else on the strip is knocking your socks off.",

I tried the orzo meatballs and the grilled cheese with the arugula salad. Everything was wonderful and every last crumb was devoured. Other things to note are the decor is absolutely gorgeous and they play AWESOME music.",

The photo booth in the waiting area made time fly - and the decor was incredible.  We were promptly sat at what is arguably the best view in the house with a full view of the strip.   We wanted to try everything, so we tried the Ricotta  Crostinis, Bacon Wrapped Dates and Tomato Arancini.   The ricotta crostini appetizer was the perfect balance, nice and light with a hint of sweet stemming from the ricotta/honey combo. The bacon wrapped dates were a favorite, particularly if you like a hearty app. The tomato arancini was addictive. We ate every single bite.  We shared the Cacio e Pepe and it's a True show. Brought out with a large cheese wheel and made table side, this was legit the best cacio e pepe I've ever had.   We had desserts, but honestly the rest of the meal was the star of the show. Hats off to this fab spot!",

I went to the restaurant with incredibly high expectations as I make so many recipes of hers at home. The food was just okay. The salad wasn't anything special and the risotto was gritty and overcooked. I was hoping her risotto would be amazing. It wasn't. The best part about the whole meal was the bread service, which was in fact amazing. Homemade bread with delicious dips/toppings. Fantastic. Overall, the portions were extremely small and we left feeling disappointed. Quite a bummer.",

Too start out with, I went with the Summer Caprese Salad which was very crisp and tasty! For the entree, went with  Veal Chop Saltimbocca which I thought was a little over cooked, but still pretty good. And for the desert, knowing that this is one of her strong suits, I went Strawberry Pistachio Tart as I can't pass up anything Strawberry lol. She (My wife) went with Arugula, Salmon (which I took a bite of and was perfect) and for desert went with Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Overall, the food was pretty good, didn't disappoint me like Guy Furi's burger joint did, and I would recommend this place!",

    "text": "Going to Giada made for such a lovely, personalized dining experience! I called about an hour in advance to make lunch reservations, and they were able to seat us by the window with a view. On the phone, they asked if the reservation was for a special occasion (it was for an anniversary), which was where the ~magic~ began.  From the minute we walked in, the host greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary: a sweet and personal touch. While we waited for our table (as we had arrived a few minutes early), we took pictures in the photo booth. Our server then showed us to our table, and we ordered from the brunch menu.   Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of vegetarian options other than the salad - and no substitutions could be made - but the options they did have were marked as vegetarian on the menu, making them easy to find. I ordered the cavatelli pasta, which tasted delicious, and my partner and I both had glasses of the house sangria, which was sweet and crisp, but tasted a bit diluted because of all the ice. For dessert, I used the Yelp check-in offer for a plate of cookies, which they decorated with a chocolate-piped \"Happy Anniversary\", which was the finishing touch on our personalized dining experience.   Overall, Giada exceeded our expectations. Despite the fact that they couldn't do a lot of vegetarian substitutions, their tasty food and personalized dining experience and service (from start to finish) were truly one of a kind.",

The wait staff were great although the hostesses were clearly not trained properly to make their guests feel welcome. No apologies for the extra wait.

    "text": "To summarize the food we had was great the service and waitress we had was terrible to say the least.  We tried to make a reservation ahead of time and of course it's very busy because it's a brand new and first giada restaurant.  We were informed by the hostess to come in and try to get a seat in the bar area as it was not a very busy night. Beware if you sit in the bar area it is a different menu than the regular dining.  We arrived and checked with the hostess and she showed us where we could sit in the lounge next to the bar. This is when the terrible experience started.... Keep in mind this is a Tuesday night and while all tables were full it was not busy other than that.  It took around 15 minutes to first be greeted by any server. We then got greeted by one server and got told another one would be around right away. 5 minutes later she came around.  We informed her that we would be eating in the lounge area and ordered drinks.  My girlfriend had a bad dairy allergy so we thought all of the vegan options on the regular menu would make this a great place to go.  Unfortunately the lounge menu had no vegan options, when asking the waitress for possible options without dairy she suggested ONE appetizer and was not knowledgable at all. When asking about other items she said she would check with the kitchen.. While she did that we ordered the one item.  We also asked for the bread provided to all customers who are dining which we NEVER received.  A kitchen staff brought the one item we ordered out and it was delicious.  Our waitress finally came back 10 minutes later and did not give us any information on the non dairy items nor did she bring over any bread. I did not want to wait any longer so I asked for the check stating that it didn't seem like the dairy allergy could be accommodated.  Meanwhile I know from looking at the full menu there are vegan items. The waitress did not even try and stop us from leaving or ask kitchen staff for recommendations.  It was truly a bad experience.    I had very high hopes for the restaurant. And it was the most anticipated dinner on our vacation. But to avoid my girlfriend being embarrassed or trying to deal with terrible waiting staff I can say I will not be coming back or recommending this to anyone else.",

After all the bad reviews of charging up to $35 or more for 1\\2 cup of pasta hasn't changed.  I ordered the tortellini with asparagus and artichokes. With the few items on my plate to make up the entire dish I thought I only had a couple tortellini.  When I questioned the waiter about it, he proceeded to pick up my spoon touching my plate saying \"there's a tortellini, there's a tortilini, there's a tortellini...ok sorry there were 5 dime size tortellinis that looked to me like the 1/2 small tomato that was in the dish..I found that way of answering to be a bit rude.  (He did offer to make me another dish, which I declined but he insisted and did not charge).  We also ordered the \"smashed\" lemon potatoes which I had my first visit and was very disappointed to find they were no longer smashed lemon potatoes, but roasted fingerlings w/Parmesan cheese.  When I asked the waiter about the potoes he said they were the same...please...I loved them so much the first time I looked up Giadas recipe and made them myself..this was not the same dish. The desert man came by with his cart, he deliberately bent over to one of the people in our party to say \"do you always look like your mad after eating\".then walked away and never came back...who does that!!!!  I was hoping for a redemption dinner from my first expierence, but I won't be back and won't be recommending this resturant. If I'm going to pay these expensive prices I expect an amazing dish, one that exudes the talents of a master chef...this was less appetizing than the family Italian resturant we might frequent on a causal night.",

I loved the tour of the place before seated at my table. I absolutely appreciated meeting the manager, Avi, during my stay and the wait staff was wonderful. The menu presentation is current and unique and the bread tray was delightfully unexpected in design. I ordered the seafood risotto, a dish I had been eyeing leading up to my restaurant visit. I love how the spice/ garnish tray complimented my meal, with mini bowls of capers, red chili flakes, pesto, and grated Pecorino Romano. The dish was the right combination of savory and salty and truly satisfying as I hope it would be. Very minor detail of the night that could use improvement - filling my water glass. Water was my primary beverage for the evening and rarely had someone come over to make sure my glass remained filled. But that is just a minor detail that can easily be fixed. All in all, my experience was fantastic. Best customer service I received ever from any place I've eaten. I am coming back next time I'm in Vegas. And I'm bringing friends!",

Service was exceptional and the staff seemed to emulate Giada's enthusiasm (as seen on her show).  I had a glass of both versions of her sangria.  They were both very good.  My wife had espresso drink that was very good as well.  We shared some cheese and meats as we dropped in for a snack.  I like the decor of the restaurant.  It definitely has a Giada feel to it.  My only complaint is that the restaurant is a bit overpriced when compared other other restaurants in the same class.  All in all, a place to definitely check out.",

    "text": "Tip: make an open table reservation!! But they don't allow you to get the points from 6-8  Super super underwhelmed with this place. I feel like just like most big name restaurants, you get good quality food served in a very unnatural and non palate pleasing manner.  Came here with a Groupon because I had always wanted to try it but the prices are quite pricey (entrees ranging from 30-65$) Wanted to try and make a reservation for sitting by the window to enjoy the view, but was told that you need to spend 150$ per person to sit there: we had 4 people so they expected us to spend $600 which was ridiculous.  When we arrived we were sat in the back of the restaurant (probably due to the groupon) and had no view or was even close to the window.  TIP: When you check in- the whole table gets a free sparkling wine- they were serving proseco that night.  Food ordered was: 1) appetizers: - orzo meatballs: $15 very bland meatballs that were covered in red tomato sauce- super underwhelming and not tasty- not recommended- 5 meatballs were served about 1 inch in diameter- not the meaty/veal/ground beef umami taste I expected- more like dry turkey meatballs and orzo  - eggplant Parmesan: $12- 2 very small slivers of eggplant broiled with scamorza cheese and covered in red sauce- not recommended  2) pasta sample platter (x2): a small small small portion of pasta- less than a small fistful of pasta 36$- me and my friend ordered one each so we could try them all - lemon caper spaghetti- I personally hated it but my friend loved the fact that it was a new flavor combination and the zesty garlicky taste felt fresh and not heavy or expected- SUPPOSEDLY with shrimp but both mine and my friends order has no sign of shrimp in it -bucatini: very spicy and more spice than taste- both of us disliked it- kinda mango spicy tangy - rigatoni: vegetable bolognase- mine was personally had a burnt taste- overly roasted  - the last one was my personal fav: served with braised beef and basil- long noodles (don't remember the name)  3) branzino- served with olives and tomatoes- super crispy and white tender inside- Def recommend  4) Salmon- nothing special- served on top of a risotto or something- broiled- plain- no taste, was tender but def needed seasonings  Overall the food was subpar, service was great don't get me wrong, but I would never return or recommended this place to anyone.",

    "text": "My sister and I came to Vegas for a sisters' trip and enjoyed our first meal here. Reservations are basically a must (open table didn't seem to work for us so had to call), walking or uber/lyft recommended since parking is expensive at the Cromwell. Giada is located on the 2nd floor so follow signs, look for the escalator. Decor is gorgeous, love the huge floor to ceiling rounded windows with perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and rest of the strip. My sister and I split the cheese wheel pasta, which was so amazingly and decadently delicious. Enjoyed that they plated it tableside, surprised that they gave us the entire wheel (it was a mini wheel, not like the giant parmesan wheels we were thinking about), and portions were huge so we had leftovers to munch on for the next day. Complimentary bread and dipping sauces was nice, free yelp check in for sparkling wine splash was cool, service was decent (our main waiter was a little snotty but the others seemed pleasant and helpful), looks like they can cater a mix of party sizes, lots of conference folks but could also envision a proposal here too",

The food was pretty decent. I ordered the chicken Marsala meatballs and was satisfied!",

    "text": "Totally disappointed.  I had higher hopes for this restaurant when I booked a table for brunch a couple of Sundays ago when I was back in Vegas for work.  I was only able to enjoy a few times out during my work trip, and it was recommended for brunch, so we gave it a try.  I love Giada's TV personality and her carefully crafted selections whenever I catch a glimpse of her show.  Now, yes, I get it, her name is on the door and she may have stake in this establishment, but sadly, only the decor was a reflection of how I imagine her to be.  The service and the food, not so much.  I'll preface this review by stating that we were in the restaurant for a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  When we arrived a few minutes early for our 1pm reservation, the table was still being prepared.  Five minutes or so after 1 we were seated.  The restaurant was barely half full as it's later in the day.  The view overlooking the corner of Flamingo Rd and LV BLVD is a sight.  Bellagio fountains across the way.    Our server was friendly enough and went over the menu, we took a few minutes to decide.  She may have gotten distracted, as we didn't see her again for another 20 minutes.  My friend orders a coffee drink and I, a grapefruit juice.  I alert my server of my allergy to peppers, and ask if I could do the salmon cake benedict without the piquillo peppers, and she   complied with my request.  My friend orders the same thing with peppers.  We don't order any starters, as we will be having a large dinner later.  Our beverages arrive, and then about a half an hour later (tick tock, tick tock, immmm.... knaws off my own arm in starvation), the server returns only to inform me that there are peppers in the actual salmon cake mix.... So, I order the Breakfast Contadina (since the other 3 options I wanted had peppers in them too)... although this $21 brunch entree better be good for that price.  I feel bad as my friend and I are just sitting there, hungry.... It's 2:15... ho hum    A server (not ours, she's been MIA as I've been wondering where my food was) comes over and nearly drops the plates on the table (accidentally) but scared the bejeezus out of us, and all our neighbors look over.  Apologizing profusely, but I was AWAKE now.  My friends dish looks so much better than mine.  Serious food FOMO.  I look at my sad wilted spinach with tomatoes in a cup, and the water pooled at the bottom... then to my eggs (clearly overcooked and browned - see photo), the smallest cup of fruit and the polenta cakes.  As my friend is eating her dish, and she admits it's only okay, the cakes were a bit dry... and her Prosecco hollandaise (looks like grits - see pic, not creamy) doesn't eve have a hint of Prosecco flavor.  I look around, and for minutes, I'm literally waving my hand in the air to grab anyones attention!    Finally after 5 minutes or so, I am greeted by Mina?  (possibly a manager), while pleasant enough, I tell her that I am not happy with my overcooked eggs, she proceeds to tell me that they are not overcooked, and this is how they cook them.  I doubt Giada serves up browned eggs that are heavy and not fluffy. (I don't recall her eggs ever looking like that on the Food Network). Mina is happy to ask for the chef to prepare soft scrambled eggs.  It's not a matter of the actual scrambling, it's a matter that the eggs were overcooked and started to turn brown, not fluffy and light yellow.  Scrambled eggs in the dictionary - a dish of eggs prepared by beating them with a little liquid and then cooking and stirring gently.  The eggs I received were either A. cooked on too high of a heat B. using the wrong pan or C. leaving the eggs on the heat too long making them slightly fried.  If I'm wrong, please check out overcooked scrambled eggs on google images.  At this point I'm downing the spinach, which is tasty enough, but watery at the bottom.  The strainer must have Sundays off.  The only savior on the plate were the amazing polenta cakes.  Even the fruit was a bit sour.  The eggs were eventually replaced, we finished our meal and had to flag down our original server again.... by the time we paid the check (they took nothing off), and I'm not looking for a free meal, but waiting two hours for some scrambled eggs and some watery spinach for $21 plus I think $9 for juice....

I had a white cosmo and it was delish!  Dave was our server and he was great!  They bring out an amazing presentation for the bread and you get two types - a rosemary olive oil and a cheese crisp type cracker. This is served with a variety of toppings.  One of the appetizers we ordered we didn't like and Dave quickly removed it and replaced with another.  If you like mushrooms, don't miss out on the wood roasted mushrooms - best mushroom dish ever!!!    I always have the bucatini and this last time I was disappointed as it wasn't as spicy as it normally is. When I mentioned this to Dave, he told me that \"they had to tone it down as people thought it was too spicy\" but he immediately brought me out the Calabrian chili to spice it up and it was much better.  My husband had the crab and scallop risotto and he said the scallop was cooked perfectly but he didn't taste any of the crab in the risotto.    Make a reservation as this place is hoppin'!  There is a photo fun booth in the entrance which is a fun touch; you email your photo to yourself.",

I came at a weird time where it wasn't lunch or dinner but grabbed a seat at the empty bar where there was a snack menu available. I ordered a variety of snacks and the bartender was super helpful in helping me pick a variety. I ended up with an arugula salad with candied lemon and pancetta (yum!) and a plate of 2 meats and a cheese which came with raw honey, mustards and apple. Everything I had was great! Obviously I didn't get the opportunity to delve into the full dinner menu because by then I was full but before I left I felt like I needed to give dessert a go. I ordered the cookie plate and honestly, those were damn good cookies. Lemon ricotta were totally worth it but what really shocked me was described to me as a peanut butter raspberry? Whatever it was, I was impressed. If I'm back in Vegas, I'd definitely head there for a dinner or brunch to be able to try more items. In the end, what made Giada even better was the top notch service! Bartenders, Rick and Giovanni (Jovaughn?) were very friendly, helpful and attentive. I think some of the friendliest bartenders on the strip!",

After spending $110/person, most persons left hungry.  They were stingy with bread, I'm not sure if bread is the item they should be saving money on.  Appetizers and salads arrived and were served simultaneously.  We would have preferred them as separate courses.  My waiter cared more about selling me more wine and left me to sit in dirty dishes after checking back two times.  Most pasta entrees are served at approx. 5 ounces and cost what you'd expect to pay for a huge portion.   I was also disappointed that their tiramisu was tiramisu cheesecake, we tried it but it was not great.  They also did not have my favorite italian liqueur at their bar.  For $110 per diner, I am sad to say that most of my party was a tad bit hungry soon after.   Lastly, they hit everyone in my party with a gratuity.  We finally left dinner past 9 pm from a 530 pm reservation.  I need to speak up when asked whether I have anywhere to be after dinner -  we did not have a show to catch but I lose major interest after the 2 hour mark when in Las Vegas, and there is some love lost for leaving me to sit in dirty dishes.",

Our server was efficient, however she was really pushy on us to order more. We chose the Cacio e pepe bucatini for two at 64$ and our server kept saying, most people would order another main with it etc. We dont eat too much and we felt really pressured and uncomfortable! And guess what? We didn't even finish the pasta. I swear unless you have a massive appetite dont listen to them when they try to upsell you. I felt like she was trying to make us spend more to give a bigger tip or something... it was so bizarre! I lowered the rating because of the service, I don't like going out to eat and being judged, maybe it was because I used a voucher.The dinner was delicious and almost theatrical as it arrives in a pecorino wheel and they serve it tableside. Very heavy and creamy!",

The food was just OK - not worth spending $500 for 4 people.   I spent my \"golden year\" 29 on 29 there, and apparently the server also knew, but we were never even given a birthday dessert or even a candle. How disappointing.   We ordered the orzo meatballs for $20 bucks, which were miniscule pieces. The taste wasn't anything special.   I personally ordered the Branzino, and since I'm not too familiar with this term, I thought it would be a similar style to a Chilean Sea Bass - nope, just fried fish with tomatoes that you can get at your local fish store.   From our entire table, I must say that maybe the lobster ravioli was the best, which was not even that great, and it didn't even fill any of us up. We had to walk over to Giordano's at Bally's later on to satisfy our hunger after leaving Giada's.   Well...I guess I could say at least I've been there!",

We had the risotto and lobster fettuccine. Both excellent and delicious. We finished the meal with a berry panna cotta which was very good. Service was good. We loved it. We are already planning a return visit!!!",

    "text": "I'm often disappointed by high-end restaurants and this was no exception. Our friends went prior and highly recommended Giada's, but I think the difference is that when the boss is there, everyone in the restaurant delivers top notch service.   We went on an ordinary day for dinner and there was no Giada. We were seated, and sat for a while before being greeted. Once greeted, we were immediately given the wine menu. We sat, and sat, and our server came to take our wine order, except she never offered us a cocktail menu. We asked for a cocktail menu and the drinks were either a hit or a miss. The first thing you do in a restaurant is offer the drink menu...isn't that the easiest way to earn revenue?  Then we proceeded to order our main dish. We ordered the fried chicken, spaghetti with shrimp, lemon and marscapone, the octopus panzanella and lobster ravioli. While we waited for our main dish to arrive, we were given one bread basket with 4 pieces of bread the share amongst the 7 of us. When we asked for an additional bread basket, we were told we had to finish the first bread basket before receiving another and got a funny look. How lame is that when a table of two receives 4 pieces of bread like we did, but a table of 7 also receives 4 pieces? We complained to our server, and she indicated that's the rule. No need to be conjuice Giada!  Anyhow, the bread was fabulous, the ravioli was good, the friend chicken was nothing out of the ordinary, the octopus panzanella was just okay, and the pasta, which is a Giada signature, totally fell flat on flavor. You couldn't taste any lemon and it tasted like a boring alfredo. We did order all three sides and they were good, but nothing special. But I must say the corn and sausage was delicious.  I was so excited to try a celebrity owned restaurant and this was a big disappointment. I've often made Giada's recipes with great success, so I was looking forward to this experience. But totally not worth the money or the hype. I heard the Bobby Flay restaurants are all consistently great. That's where I'll go next time.",

Our table was against the window looking out at Bellagio and Caesar's.  Our great server Joseph suggested we try the special tasting menu which was $120 pp. - we were so glad we did as it was spectacular. The only downside is that we were so full that we had to take our dessert home with us. Make your reservations well in advance and ask for a window table. Truly a unique experience with fantastic service and delicious Giada food.",

Visited Giada's on 7/21/18 and had the pleasure of Rocco M.'s wisdom to guide us to just the right selections. If you ever find yourself at Giada's do yourself a favor from the start and ask for a Rocco table!  Rocco expertly steered me to the Risotto with crab and scallops and it was incredible!  The atomsphere, view, service . . . everything was topnotch.   My best friend and I had such an amazing meal that we came back the next night (7/22/18) and asked to be seated at a \" Rocco M\" table again!  This time we had the added bonus of having Saji helping us out for the night.  Between the two of them we had another great meal and were also able to pepper them with every \" Giada's \" question we ever wanted to ask . . . which they patiently answered!  Thanks for going the extra mile, Rocco and Saji!   Showing that those hailing from the great state of Texas do indeed do things bigger, the Manager ( who hails from San Antonio) even stopped by our table to say Howdy to his fellow Texans!    The second night, to save room for desserts, we had 2 Antipasti, Corn Arancini and Baconwrapped dates. I am sure I will never have another dessert as good as the Salted Caramel and Berry Panna Cotta.  Overall, Giada's did not disappoint and we will be coming back!",

    "text": "Father's Day Brunch 2017  Wait: ~30 minutes without a reservation around noon.  Ordered: Rise and Shine Juice $9 The Brunch tasting Menu $45- Assorted pastry basket, antipasti platter, Italian Chicken & Waffles and cacciatore sauce, and Limoncello Souffle with Creme Anglaise  Wait for food: longer than I've experienced (during the dinner hours). Asked server about the delay and she stated they were having \"issues in the kitchen\"  The food: Since opening, I have always been a fan of the antipasti at Giada's & the platter is a must-try every time (esp the bacon wrapped dates!). Rise and Shine Juice was refreshing with a nice balance between all components (not too much celery..thankfully). The Italian Chicken and Waffles utilizes the same chicken offered as 'Whole Roasted Chicken for 2' on the dinner menu, chicken pieces were drier than I've had at Giada's previously, but it is a hearty portion in comparison to some of the other mains offered. Limoncello souffle portion is plenty for two..more than enough for one. A great ending to a satisfying meal.  Service: Spotty at best. Our servers seemed overwhelmed with the brunch crowd and rarely checked our table..despite passing by it in order to reach their stand. In the past, we never had issues with getting our drinks refilled..however, this time around we only received refills if we waved one of them down.  Overall: 4 star brunch experience minus 1 star for lackluster service. I'll probably return for dinner.  P.S. Don't forget to swing by the photobooth (to the left of the hostess stand when you get off the escalators)",

Once we were seated for dinner, we waited 20 minutes during which we were poured a glass of water each...no bread...just water. At the 20 minute mark the waiter arrived to take our order. As I was in mid-sentence our waiter just walked away...no EXCUSE ME...no I'LL BE RIGHT BACK...just walked away! On his return, I finished placing our order only to be told immediately, \"WE ARE OUT OF THAT!\" (I'm sure Chef John D. thought his wait staff had more common sense than to just blurt that out to a customer) He then asked if there was something else he could get me and my reply, \"The Manager\". He left our table and 5 minutes later the waiter showed back up. His words, \"Now we DO have want you want!\" Needless to say, we had totally lost faith in this poorly run restaurant so again I requested the Manager. We waited another 5 minutes and still no Manager (total of 10 minutes of waiting on a Manager)   My wife and I then got up and walked out of GIADA. Definitely an anniversary we will NEVER forget!!!! GIADA WOULD BE ASHAMED TO ACTUALLY SEE HOW WE WERE TREATED! So Giada, what if this was you and your husband on YOUR anniversary???",

Two items to work on the sun screens flap in the breeze and could hit someone or clear the wine glasses from the tables. When you are asked to wait, sit at the bar order a drink and the hostess wishes to seat you without the drink or the tab the service is not transparent. You have to wait until you get their attention to ring the tab as opposed to sending the tab to the  table.  Joseph was exceptional, his training on service and the menu were quite apparent.",

Had Valentino as a waiter, didnt care much for his introduction to us as first time customers. Let him know we were celebrating my friends birthday! Ordered a bottle of still water soon as he came to the table, 15 mins later had to ask another buss boy for our water, our app already made it to the table by then. Salmon dinner was very good, we shared that and the spaghetti dinner. Asked if we wanted dessert? We said no thank you and he brought us the check.. Kinda disappointed that a little birthday dessert was too much to ask for after spending $100 on two dinners and a app.",

My wife suggested I try Giada. I checked it on yelp and saw good reviews, some not so good, but her food on TV looks so amazing and simple. Decided to give it a try.  Party of 1, no problem, they have a great bar with full service menu. And by service I mean. \"Great service\". I sat across from the barista and was entertained the whole time. The pizzeria station next to me I also was in the middle of some really good aromas.  I ordered the Orzo meat balls, $15. Small app, maybe pricey, but it's vegas. For my meal I was recommended the Bucatinee, I think I spelled that right. That was amazing, great bit of spice and fresh ricotta to cool it off.  The portion was just right for me. I'm not trying to eat a pound of pasta as some other may be.  I was however disappointed at the dessert. I ordered the lemon unit cake and it was as dense as a rock.  Overall a great experience and would recommend it.",

This visit I partook in the dinner tasting menu. The Rigatoni with vegetable bolognese was delicious, fresh pasta cooked perfectly all dented makes you realize the number of times you ate pasta incorrectly, what a difference in flavor and texture. Crusted Rack of Lamb with grain mustard give a hint of spice to a wonderful flavor profile.dessert consisted of lemon ricotta cookies, polenta cake, brownie, tiramisu, banana gelato and strawberry sorbet. I could go on about the desserts but I will say my favorites were the polenta cake, light and tasty, lemon ricotta cookie, vibrant flavor of lemon will make your mouth pucker but go for another bite and the banana gelato, creamy, sweet and marvelous flavor of banana won't disappoint. If you have the opportunity and tine to sit and enjoy it, go for the tasting menu, it requires table participation but with that you are able to order different items which means you can share and sample the numerous selections available in one trip which makes it worth it, not to mention you also receive a souvenir copy of the menu, a few of the recipes and a signed picture of the executive Chef, Giada. Thank you staff for another wonderful dining experience!!",

We had a large party (13 people) so we were seated in a private room with a balcony overlooking the strip. It was absolutely amazing. Our food was so delicious, our wait staff was very attentive and we couldn't have asked for anything more. We love Giada's!!!!",

My husband was not expecting much because of some reviews he had read.   We had a great time. The photo booth at the waiting area was fun. We were seated on time.  Our server was excellent.  She made some recommendations that were great.  I enjoyed the cheeses with the different pairings of honey.  Interesting flavors.   Our server recommended a beer but discovered that they were out of it.  She brought another beer over and stated that it was on the house if I didn't like it.  A Moretti La Rossa, which was excellent.  I ordered the lasagna while my husband ordered the pizza.  The pizza took some time and it arrived at the table half way through everyone else's entrees, so they comped the pizza.  Pizza was tasty, but the lasagna was a little bland for my taste.    Overall the service was excellent.  I think our server's name is Erin.  The food was above average.  Limited lunch menu.  Nice decor and atmosphere.  Will return to to try out dinner for a better review of the food.",

Very Nice decor, professional staff, peaceful ambiance, great music, good fresh food, fair priced were all positive attributes. I had the Caprese Frittata with Prosciutto, it was bigger than expected, fresh and delicious. I sampled the \"Breakfast American,\" all I remember was that the bacon was perfect. I guess I wasn't amazed because I only ordered basics... It's hard to screw up an egg dish. One thing that was great and stood out was the \"Chocolate croissant monkey bread,\" long story short I took some to go! I look forward to going back to sample more dishes.",

We decided to get a drink at the bar while waiting. The Bar Chairs are very comfortable. Our Bartender Rob was super knowledgable, friendly and gave us great service. I started with a french 77 that was made to perfection. I kept seeing a drink that came up a lot. I asked about it and Rob said it was the Barbarella. He listed off the ingredients and I immediately told him that I HATED Gin. He said Id love this drink and because he was so confidant I tried it.. Loved it! The only Gin drink I have ever liked! Well, by this time it was 9pm. 45 mins into our reservation so we went to the front and we were assured we were up next. 5 mins later we were escorted to the tiniest table in the whole place with no view. The restaurant is lovely but this is an unacceptable table. We decided to eat at the Bar because it is actually much more comfortable. We ordered the Risotto and Ravioli. Both Amazing! We ordered Lemon Meringue for dessert. It is packed with flavor! Too good to get a picture of it. All in All I would recommend the restaurant but only because Rob made the experience memorable.",

My husband & I have eaten at world famous restaurants and we were pleasantly surprised that Giada's surpassed our expectations!

Mix them all together with the ridiculous rosemary bread and Parmesan cheese crackers and several other accompaniments and prepare to be blown away! Her wine list is grand with some affordable delicious choices. As if that wasn't enough we both finished it off with a fresh pasta dish. My husband raves about the Lobster ravioli but I didn't try it due to an allergy. I had the tortellini with pea pesto, pancetta & mint! I may have licked the bowl clean if I weren't in public, lol! My hubby had to have espresso with Sambuca with the three beans. I had Italian roast coffee with Baileys. We shared one half of a Tiramasu Cheesecake...OMG...If I died and went to heaven this is what it would look like! Bravissimo",

    "text": "I have watched Giada on TV for many years and been waiting to dine at her restaurant ever since it was opened. After several attempts to make a reservation I was able to eat there and I was very disappointed.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a California beachy vibe and felt very welcoming.   The service was alright and the bread they offer was above average with a tasty pesto sauce which we liked, and then, things started to go downhill...  We ordered the eggplant parmesan which I was very surprised to see was improperly cooked and the eggplant was raw and gummy and the sauce was nothing special. Very simple flavors.   We then had the octopus salad. The octopus itself was cooked nicely but the sweet potato puree and olives did not add anything to the dish and the salad lacked flavor. Very uninspired.   Next we had the beef tenderloin on potato chips with curry sauce. It was a cold piece of beef which was overcooked, I could not taste any curry flavor either. We couldn't even finish the dish.   We were so disappointed up until this point and I suggested with give her another chance and decided to try her pasta and aranchini. We ordered the spaghetti with shrimp and the lemon crab aranchini. The shrimp was over-cooked and the paste although made well did not have any flavor. I couldn't taste the basil or lemon. Just bland bland pasta and overcooked shrimp that did not smell good. The crab anarchic was alright, the lemon sauce was nice, however, by the time we got to it I had totally lost my appetite and felt so underwhelmed and disappointed with the whole experience that we only a few bites and left the dish unfinished.   I was so looking forward to this experience and had made our reservation 3 months in advance. I wish I could write a great review but unfortunately it did not get close to what I was expecting.",

    "text": "Being a Giada fan, I was quite anxious to try this place out for my friend's birthday who loves Giada. Place actually deserves a 2.5 but there were a few things that up'd their score from what I would of given them to a three.   The branding, decor, large open room, is spectacular. Very modern. Everything you can imagine has her famous \"G\" signature on them. She uses the sleekest and most modern flatware and other supplies. That is so Giada and it's gorgeous. Also, good expressos.  Now on to the bad - Note, this review is solely based on lunch experience.  1. Like most, you're not getting your money's worth for the small portions of food. Whether you order appetizers or a meal, there was nothing that exceptional about it. I don't mind the high prices, but make it worth it. Being from Orange County, travelled to some of the finest restaurants in New York, DC, and SF, you will find much better food for the relatively same high prices elsewhere. Generally, lunch menu food was just mediocre.   2. Our girlfriends ordered a side of prosciutto for $18, mozzarella balls for $11 and a side of gorgonzola cheese for $13. Prices apps, yes. But the issue here is what the heck do you eat these with?  Do they expect us to scoop a chunk of cheese and eat it like ice cream? We asked for bread or crackers - something that makes sense to serve with cheese and delis and our waitress response was we don't have bread but you can order a sandwich. Now mind you, she said sandwiches so you must have something to eat it with. After waiting to speak with the manager while our food sits there for 15 min, they were able to accommodate us by giving us parmesan crisp. That was a freaken lot of work to get parmesan crisps!   3. I ordered the pizza. Came out lukewarm and bread was doughy and uncooked. My other gf ordered a chicken carbonara dish and came out cold and chicken was tough. Manager was more than glad to send it back and bring out another dish which were compensated. This certainly was a nice gesture. My pizza was flavorful b/c of the spicy meats that were on there but it still seem to be lacking something in the sauce. The carbonara was much better simply by looking at it seeing that now it was glistening moist.  4. There deli sandwich come with an aioli already made and you cannot get aioli on the side which I never heard of such a thing. Whatever, this is minor.  5. And right, like another review, for the amount of money spent here, the birthday dessert is 6 cookies. While some were fresh out of the oven, I never seen such a cheap and tacky dessert for a high-end place.   6. The place smelled like a cigar room instead of a nice Italian aroma you should smell when you walk in. This was gross.  7. As with one of the raters, the seating arrangements seem quite cramped. I felt that if I laid back on my chair, someone would walk right into me.   8. The restaurant seems crazy. There was just so many workers, some of which were just standing around while a handful of others were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I felt that they wanted you in and out with no personal dining experience focus. Sometimes you go to restaurants and you can connect with who is helping you. Not here.  9. It was hard to tell what theme Giada is striving for. People came in with their laptops so is it a cafe style place. But you serve lunch and half of the menu was just tapas like selections.   Overall, this place may be good for others but definitely not for me, even for a Giada fan. Real tempted to rate it a 2 but manager saved the day for us.",

Before our appetizers even came out, our waiter knocked my drink off the table. The glass shattered all under our table and into my sandals. The drink had spilled all over my sweater and hair and got in my eyes so I couldn't open them until I got a clean napkin free if glass shards. He apologized once, offered to get me a new drink, and was never seen again. The bus boy was left to clean (barely) up while neither a manager or the waiter apologized or offered me and my family anything in return for this mistake.  The menu is arranged easily for family type sharing, however two of the three pasta dishes came out cold.   The dress that all female workers were wearing says a lot about Gilda's personality. The half sheer, skin tight, extremely short dresses clearly shows the type of respect Giada has for fellow women.",

    "text": "Two years ago Giada's was an amazing 5 star rating and that is why we returned there with our party of ten last night.  After turning down the $120 per person tasting menu, it became apparent our server was more about pushing dishes on us than service.  No matter what we asked or ordered, he would say \"we needed more,\" \"the portion is tiny,\" \"it's made for 4-5 people,\" etc.  Listening to his advice, we deferred to his suggestions.  We ended up w way too much food.  An example, \"the salmon was really small- too small to share, you'll need two.\" So people listened and ordered more or duplicates.  It was absolutely not the case.  There was plenty that almost 2-3 could have shared after having appetizers and salads.  On  another note, the famous chicken highlighted in a magazine, was not only dry, but an entire entree of it went uneaten- $59.  We all walked away baffled how that was a signature dish when in comparison Costco's $5 rotisserie was significantly more moist and tasty.    Simply stated, be aware of what you're ordering.  You can always add more plates if the portions are insufficient.  The gratuity was added for parties 6 and up - so our server insured he made what he wanted from our table after denying him the $120pp option instead of providing us the sort of service one would expect from Giada.  Again, a very disappointing and different experience than two years ago, and it unfortunately does not compel our party of ten to return when we were so excited about bringing our them there.  The thing about Vegas is that there are lots of fantastic restaurants to choose from.",

We managed to get two seats at the bar and had an amazing experience. Eric, our bartender was excellent, answered every question and made plenty of recommendations. We had the eggplant parmesan \"fries,\" an anchovy crostini, a side of broccoli rabe, and the lobster ravioli. Three of the four dishes were fabulous. It's the  lobster ravioli I probably wouldn't get again. Though it had lots of lobster, it just was not worth the price (30something dollars for a rather small portion). Next time I would get two small plates instead to try more things.  I also feel like they could offer a few more wines by the glass, but overall a great experience.",

If you're a foodie in Vegas, Giada is the place to be right now so I couldn't wait to go there for my wedding anniversary, 8/8.   To sum it up, our experience was disappointing and way over priced for the style of food. I'm pretty desensitized to my hometown prices and this was still crazy given the service time and quality of food.   Hostess was sweet, server was nice but highly sales driven. Both knowledgable about the restaurant but only mehh when it came to the food. Service was extremely slow. Antipasti came out at a good pace, but didn't get our pastas until 2 hours into dinner. Easily the slowest fine dining service I've ever had.   Bread was good, but I wish it was served with olive oil or even butter. It's served with cheese, capers and pesto. I have a pine nut allergy and they had no substitution for the pesto. Cool for a $50 per person restaurant, not cool for a $125 per person restaurant.   Meatballs, burrata, crostini antipasti dishes and the salads were fine. Pastas were 4-oz serving sizes, roughly $36 each and very underwhelming. The lemon spaghetti was too sweet for dinner, tasted like a lemon cookie. A little weird.   Bought a dessert, which they placed on a \"Happy Anniversary\" plate. Who pays for birthday or anniversary desserts?! It's basically universal for restaurants to bring you a complimentary occasion dessert THEN ask if you'd like to purchase another. Best practices people.   Virtually any Bellagio, Wynn, ARIA, MGM Grand contemporary or fine restaurant KILL Giada when comparing service and food quality. Most 5-star reviewers here must live under a foodie rock, or the namesake of Giada just overpowers their senses. Makes sense as people hate wanting things so badly and admitting disappointment.",

I am so disappointed in myself for choosing to eat at Giada's...  I fell for the 4.5 star rating on Yelp, at the time, back when there were only 50-60 total reviews...I knew better....    The New York Times's Pete Wells just panned this place, which I was fully prepared to do as well...I absolutely didn't like anything about it.  Two of my favorite quotes from his review, that I feel cover all of my feelings:  1.  \"All of it is in a relaxed, approachable California-Italian mode, and none of it is very hard to leave on the plate,\"  2.  \"Something was missing here -- maybe the commercial that on television would have run between the first chicken and the second.\"",

We had a brunch reservation and walked up to the hostess who made us wait for our table despite the restaurant being completely open.  Secondly, 3 of the 4 of us ordered coffee (see below), which we sent back.  The waiter reluctantly offered us juice instead.  On our final bill we were charged for the juice instead of the coffee and the juice was more expensive.  We thought at a minimum he would charge us for the cheaper coffee drinks we ordered or give us good service and comp. the drinks.  The waiter was not friendly or attentive.   The coffee was so watery it wasn't even worth drinking.  We all ordered different things (latte, cappuccino and straight brewed coffee) and they all tasted really, really awful.  We heard the couple at the table across from us also complaining about the coffee and dousing their drinks with sugar and cream.  We all understand if the machine or whatever was not functioning properly but as mentioned above, they did not take care of us.  I don't think giada would stand for this.   On the plus side, the actual food was good.  None of us were sure it was worth the money for a pretty standard breakfast, but the items we ordered tasted good.  The decor in the restaurant was also nice.   If the restaurant can take huge strides on the service front and make sure they have good tasting coffee for breakfast, the experience would be much better.",

We were seated right away in the part of the dining room behind the planters. I actually loved the decor and feeling of this little semi-secluded area. We were greeted right away and then brought menus. It took us a moment to figure out what to do. I knew I wanted the burrata to start. I ordered the famous lemon spaghetti as my entree, my Hubby ordered the chicken cacciatore to share with me, my kids had the grilled cheese and chicken strips from the kids menu.   I know it took a minute for us to order but our server send out everything at one time. So I had burrata, lemon spaghetti, and chicken cacciotore all at once. I expect that from Olive Garden(it's actually happened), not Giada's. The kids grilled cheese was really tasty, the server had the pesto put on the side.   The food was good, I ate maybe a quarter of the burrata. Do not let your lemon spaghetti get cold. I had to take my kids to the restroom and the food arrived as we were getting up. It still tasted great but had it bern hot it would have rocked! The chicken is ABSOLUTELY worth ordering, it is amazing! The sauce was perfect in acidity without being overwhelming, it had notes of bacon, and plenty of veggies.   I was very unimpressed with service. She had 7 or 8 tables and was basically an order taker in a diner.  She never cleared a plate, mis en placed, or filled a water. Because the cohesion of service actually hurt the way I intended to enjoy dinner, I'm taking 2 stars.",

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to our prior experiences. Ambiance - fortunately, that hasn't changed. The photo booth is still there in the waiting area. A fun way to kill some time while you are waiting for your table. Entering through the bar is still drop dead beautiful, with the glass wall in front of you looking out on the Strip. We requested, and got, a table by the window. Wonderful view! Food - This was a big disappointment. The last 2 times we were here, one dish was better than the next. This time, not so much. My wife started with the pea soup. It is a cold soup served in an ice cold very large bowl. Very impressive presentation. But the flavor was meh. I had the risotto with crab and scallops. Except I asked for shrimp instead of the scallops. The  2 jumbo shrimp were delish. The scraps of crab that I think were in the dish were hard to find and added nothing to the flavor (maybe they thought I wanted only shrimp and no crab or scallops??).  The dish was edible, but certainly not good. Our friend ordered the surf and turf. She was very clear that she wanted the meat to be medium well. When it came, it was red on the inside - rare! It took them about 15 minutes to bring her dish back. My wife and I were nearly done with our meal before that arrived. Basically, she ate alone. And the surf part of the dish was one piece of lobster ravioli - about 1 inch in diameter. Disappointing \"surf\" portion of the meal.  Service - Our prior experiences with Giada included great service. Not so this time. Our server was very personable. Unfortunately, not very attentive. When we pointed out the problem with my friend's dish, she agreed with the error in preparation. No apology. The manager, who spent a lot of time with the people at the next table (I suspect VIPs) never dropped by to apologize. Yes, they comped her meal. That didn't make up for the fact that she had to eat alone after we had finished. Add that to the fact that they didn't bring the bread or refill our waters without our having to hunt down our server to ask for it. To sum up, ambiance still 5 stars, food 3 to 4 star, and service, I will be generous and give 3 stars. I was torn between a 3 or 4 star overall rating. Considering the price of the meal, I decided to go with 3 star.",

I am so disappointed at this restaurant and would not expect it to taste like this if Giada were there cooking. What turnoff. All you are paying for is the celebrity status, not quality.",

Went on a weekday and was somewhat busy, order signature lemon spaghetti, lamb chops, bacon dates, and small salami pizza. The food in general was tasty and service was good. Nice ambiance. The food was good like I said, but nothing to justify the steep price. Btw they offer a tasting menu u can order $125 per person and u get Giana's signed photo. No thanks. I'm here to eat not get autographs. Lol",

Apparently reservations don't mean a damn thing...nor does the hostess telling you reservations are running on time when you check in only to be told after your reservation time has passed it will be 15 more mins.  I'll update later...if it's worthy time to even do so!  Update: so I honestly tried to have a positive attitude for the remainder of the meal.  Didn't want hostesses to ruin the night.   But, unfortunately, it just never got better.  Server acted like he was doing us a favor by waiting on us and food was not really enough to fill us up.  Just got home and looking through the pantry for a bedtime snack.  Well, maybe I'll just use it as a calorie deficit for today...summer is right around the corner.  All in all, if you want an enjoyable night out, I would suggest saving your money and going a few blocks east.  Much better bang for your buck.",

The bartenders were great and drinks tasted good.  They came to grab us from the bar about 825 and led us to a table with an amazing view of the strip.    The waiter was great and very attentive the whole time.  The bread they give you was Delish and we ordered olives and buffalo motzerella to start.  Both very good.   Now comes the issue.  I ordered Veal Saltambucca and my girl got a pasta with shrimp dish.   The veal was basically a fried piece of veal for almost $50 and the pasta was about a big enough plate for a four year old for $40. The pasta had one large shrimp on it which did not smell right and she didn't even eat it.    Now onto desert.   It was great !   I forget what we share but it was really good.   Had the main course been good this would have been a five star review.",

    "text": "Had a bad experience at Giada. First, all the water glasses at my family table were either cracked with sharp edges or had a slime gooey substance on them. I wish I would have taken pictures of how gross the water glasses were. Simply having the waiter say oops I'm sorry about that and blaming it on another waiter does not cut it when I'm paying for a high priced meal on the strip with loads of other options for fine dining experiences on the Las Vegas strip. As a Las Vegas native and someone who understands that the strip economy survives on delivering superior customer service this lack of care to a health issue of clean glasses was completely unacceptable. Next, during our  meal it seemed that a photo shoot was going on in the middle of the dinning area. It was very upsetting to the other customers as the promotional photo shoot or whatever it was should have been done when the dinning area was closed. I had high expectations going in but was left utterly disappointed. I would not recommend you go to this restaurant.  Update 9/14/17 In response to the managers private comment. I did read the private message that was sent. Management at giada offered nothing more than for me to do more work  and put in more time and effort to fix their staff problems. I don't write these reviews for a free appetizer.",

For this amount, we had family style scrambled eggs, toast, lemon potatoes and sausage. I don't know about you, but 35.00 for cold eggs is outrageous. The worst part is that the servers did not put any utensils on the plate to serves said cold, pathetic eggs, so we all had to use our own forks. How disgusting. There were no utensils provided for any of the \"family style\" options, so it was a race to grab your food before someone licked their fork and went in for more. After asking for utensils 3 times, they finally arrived after the meal was gone. This place is a total rip off!",

Food rating is excellent.

I had lobster ravioli and my husband's was so unremarkable, he can' t remember what ravioli he had. When they bring your meal out,they bring a plate of spices and put it down with no explanation on what it is for. They don't season their food,it was so bland and flavorless. On the plate they had salt, red crushed pepper flakes, about 10 capers and a couple of other spices. The point of going out to eat is to have a chef prepare your food not you having to firgure out what makes the food taste better. Have we gotten so pc that it's it's not ok to season our food. The prices you pay here they should season the dishes. I have 2 of her cookbooks and we like her recipes cos they are so flavorful. I thought if I can make her recipes taste great just think what her restaurant can do. So if you're thinking of going there,buy her cookbook and save yourself money and disappointment.",

    "text": "Wanted to try Giada's after hearing good things. I booked reservations for my husbands birthday. January 24th. Reservations at 7pm. We arrive at 7pm. We were told table wasn't ready and escorted to bar area. We took a seat in the comfy couches facing the strip. Nice view. Restaurant was not full. Took a while for waitress to notice us, she handed us an iPad and took our order. This exchange took 20 minutes. Finally the hostess came to show us to our table. As I was getting up, our unfriendly waitress literally threw down a reserved plaque as she rushed by. The hostess then led us away from the dining room and stopped 15 feet away from where we were sitting (still in the bar) and tried to seat us facing the bar. My husband told the hostess that we had requested a window seat and this would not do. She told us there would be an additional wait and had us sit at the bar.  There were at least 3 open 2 seat tables open at the windows. She came back and led us to the main dining area and sat us right next to the waiter station. My husband had a strip view but I watched the wait staff the entire evening. My husbands orzo meatballs weren't anything special and my \"baby peppers\" (all 4 of them) were mush. Nothing like the description. My husband ordered the cheese tortellini. There were 7 small tortellinis but the sauce was good. My risotto smelled VERY fishy and the 2 quarter sized scallops and tiny portion were NOT worth $32.  My complaint about the portion sizes are because this is touted as an Italian \"home style\" restaurant. I expected more. If I want small portions, I will go to Twist, Joel Robuchon's or Picasso. We own a vacation home in Vegas, travel there often and enjoy our time by eating in the many restaurants.  We will NOT be returning here. We didn't order coffee or desert as we normally would. We wanted to get out as quickly as possible. Not one person acknowledged my husbands birthday (as stated on the reservation) nor did they acknowledge us as we left.  Attitude by a twenty something year old who has all the power to seat people wherever they please is disrespectful to the client paying their paycheck.  And one last thing, I know it's Vegas but I would tell Giada she has way more class than to follow the trend and let all the hostesses and waitresses wear dresses that are so short, they are constantly pulling it down because it rides up.",

Next served was a tray of assorted breads including lemon basil baguette, crostini, and Parmesan sticks, this could have been the meal itself because they served it with little bowls of marscapone, oil and fresh herbs, fried capers, sea salt, and red pepper. We shared 2 appetizers the first a bacon wrapped date stuffed with spicy sausage & Gorgonzola crema, the second eggplant fries with shaved Parmesan and light tomato dipping sauce. We opted for pasta in lieu of entrees to keep our costs down. I had small plate rigatoni with vegetable bolognese and my date had small plate bucatini (thick spaghetti) Calabrian chile & fresh ricotta. Desert was shared lemon meringue first a large meringue cookie topped with heaps of lemon curd, topped with fresh raspberry, almonds and tiny bit of sweet basil drizzle on the plate. Sheer culinary delights...are you hungry yet?",

Therefore, imagine my disappointment when my high expectations of her restaurant was shattered. We had a completely OVERPRICED Tasting Menu, about $120 per person, which includes an autographed picture of her. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I am a foodie, and this was soo overpriced, with such bad service (took them a 1/2 hour to get us drinks with an 8:30 dinner reservation), that I am sure I would NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends. Of the 4 course meal, which includes: antipasti, bread, 3 choices of pasta, 3 choices of a main, and a desert cart... the antipasti and the desert cart were the only thing to rave about. The bread came in 2 small sized baking ramikens, where each of us (8 people) could only have 1 small piece, maybe a bite and half worth of bread. The pasta was ordinary with some good flavors, and the beef, lamb, and salmon was nothing to rave about. Again... TOTALLY OVERPRICED. Also, it was soo loud that we had to yell across the table to hear each other. And the waitstaff were so slow with bringing bread, or drinks, or even water... that you thought that they forgot about you.   People, if you want good pasta, go to Scarpetta or even Lupo's... Giada totally missed the mark. IF you really want to eat here, order al a carte, and only order the pasta and maybe some anti pasti. Sorry, this was a total dining fail.",

We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. I had made reservations a good month and a half before this date. Our time was 5pm. I am a big fan of Giada's on the Food Network, and I knew the food should be great! I thought she would never put her name on a place that wasn't going to be a wonderful place to celebrate an occasion. WRONG!!!!    We went to the bar while waiting for our table, 3 glasses of wine and a tip, $54. We were seated, and I requested a window seat ahead of time, but they put us at a side table where the shutters were barely open. We were given a wine menu, a food menu, then a tasting menu. We were told we all had to order the tasting menu or no one could. Confusing! We were told to order several dishes and share them family style. Our waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the sommelier, which my husband declined, because he knew of most of the bottles on the list, and which one we wanted to order. He brought the wine over, and our one friend declined to have a glass. The waiter said, \"maybe you would like a scotch instead?\" Our friend said, \"as a matter of fact, I would\". The waiter said, \" I was joking\". He brought the scotch.     We then ordered our food, the waiter suggested the antipasti plate. We each placed our order, then the waiter said that would not be enough food for you all, so I am going to order you a lemon spaghetti also. Aaaaaa, we did not ask for that??? In the mean time, the sommelier came over. Again, we did not ask for him. The food all came out, but took along time. Portions were small, but over all, the food was good.    Then things really turned. We sat for a least 15 minutes with our dirty, finished dishes in front of us. Finally, we stacked the dishes in hopes of being noticed. Someone finally came over and removed them. There was no mention of dessert to us. Our waiter came back over and asked if we wanted to see the dessert wine menu. By that time, we were ready to move on out of there. Enough! Between the bar bill and dinner bill and 2 tips we spent close to $ 500, and to top it off there was never a mention on \" are you here for any special occasion?\"   We took the manager's card. I emailed him a few days later. He responded saying he was out of town and would call me in 2 days. No call came. 5 days after that, I emailed him again. He responded with, a sorry, I am out of town. I will call you tomorrow. Well, guess what?? No call !! Maybe if they had a manager who was around more, the poor service would not happen. Not worth your time and money going there.",

They stopped doing that and it took almost 30 minutes just to get water. They don't have that bread anymore Which is sad but I was still excited about my meal. I will say the romaine salad was particularly good. My husband and I both got a pizza because the brunch menu was pretty limited. Pizzas were ok but I have had better. Basically everything was pretty blah. With all the other options Vegas has I will go somewhere else next time I'm in town. I expect better a place with Giada's name on it. Didn't try any dessert because our waiter dropped off the menu but never came back.",

We had to ask them to heat it up, and it tasted slightly better after. The grilled cheese was bad.. Had barely any pesto flavor, the bread was soggy, and overall it tasted watery. The zucchini side that came w the grilled cheese was super yummy tho. The minestrone soup lacked any flavor.  The beignets were extremely fluffy and I actually enjoyed these. Our waitress was really nice and the ambiance is amazing. But we had to wait 30 min past our reservation to be seated and we ordered a veggie antipasti which never came. Our whole family left disappointed. I still love giada, but unless I've heard they've revamped the food I will never return.",

    "text": "The food was delicious. They had the best chicken meatballs I have ever had. The reason for my 2 stars is because of the service. We had a large lunch buffet and were not that hungry for dinner. But we still wanted to try out this place so we decided to go for dinner and have an array of tapas instead. We were waited on by a tall waiter. He was super tall so that made him stand out. However, he an air of \"we are wasting his time\" because we did not want to order large dishes! He has to learn how to behave graciously to all patrons and be polite. Will never return again because of this experience.",

Others around us seemed to be enjoying their food and having a nice time.  Glad for Giada that she was able to fix the early issues. We've referred a few friends there already and will return on our next Vegas visit.",

There are about 5 or 6 specialty cocktails on the menu but was disappointed there is no vodka drink.  Must have a vodka drink to offer as well.   Nice bread plate and you can add your own toppings (salt, butter, oil, etc.)  Appy:  Orzo meatballs - real Italian tasting, three meat mix, delicious.  Dinner: Branzino - seabass - out of this world.  We did ask for Giada's specialty spaghetti for the table.  First batch was a bit sticky.  They quickly made another batch and it was much better.  Came with shrimp that tasted like lobster - really, really good.  Love the portion sizes - not gluttonous 'Merica plates.  Just enough so you aren't starving but you aren't rolling out of there.  And there is room for dessert.  Though, we skipped it this time.   Would go back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "I can honestly say, this was a bit of a disappointment for me. I am a fan of Giada's and I was really expecting a higher caliber experience but it was not. My husband and I were in town for a couple of days for a relay race. Before we headed back we wanted to have a nice brunch somewhere. I had no idea Giada had a restaurant in Las Vegas so I was super psyched about coming here. We made a reservation the night before for noon and we got there right on time. They took about 20 minutes to seat us. The hostesses were not too friendly, but whatever. We were seated and our waitress came by to greet us and leave the menu's. It took her almost 20 minutes to come back and ask us what we wanted to drink. By that time we already knew what we wanted to eat and told her because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes just to order our meals. That was an immediate bad first impression. The drinks were good, I ordered a Bellini my husband a Mimosa. I ordered the Breakfast Contadina that had polenta cakes. They didn't have much flavor. The eggs, well they're eggs. The spinach was good. IBut overall the meal was not to the caliber I was expecting it to be. My husband ordered the Italian Hash. He also thought his meal was just \"ok\". Maybe the lunch and dinner selections are better. I will never know because I'm not ever coming back here. They just took way too long and the food was just ok. Pretty sad considering Giada is such a hit on the Food Network.",

    "text": "My brother asked me to try this restaurant and to give him a review. I made a reservation for a Tuesday evening. The hostess at another restaurant suggested to make one when I asked her about it. She said her friend was a hostess there and it does get busy. We arrived and had to get the attention of the four ladies standing behind the podium. I requested a table with a view of the strip. The service wasn't that great. We sat there for 10 minutes without anyone coming over to us. My boyfriend finally asked the two gentlemen behind us about the whereabouts of the server. The gentlemen apologized and asked us what we wanted to drink. After several minutes later, the server arrived. We had plenty of time to review the menu and were ready to order. I ordered the risotto with crab and scallops. My boyfriend ordered the lobster ravioli. For dessert, we ordered the fruit tart which was apple. The olive oil on the bread plate was one of the best I have tasted. If you're looking for a family style large Italian meal, this is definitely not the place for you. The entree portion sizes are small. My entree came with two scallops and not a lot of crab risotto. And, my boyfriend's entree had eight ravioli. So, if you are intending to share your meal this is not the place for you. Overall, the food was good, although the portion sizes are not worth the price you pay. And, nice milieu with a view of the strip.",

    "text": "Holy f&&k, where do I begin?  Love this place!! First-off, since the closure of Rosemarys Restaurant, we've been trying to find a decent gourmet eatery for special events, and while many fell short, and only a handful were contenders, Giada has become our go-to place. I have yet to try breakfast at Giada, but that's on my to-do list. Lunch is great (Lobster Roll, Grilled cheese with Prosicutto and Fried Zucchini Strings are yummy) but the service is noticably spotty, but not bad. Dinner service, however, is absolutely impeccable. Giada is worth the long wait for a dinner reservation, and worth waiting another 15-20 minutes for a window seat (if available, just ask at the reception podium) which overlooks the bustling intersection of Flamingo and The Strip - plus you get a great perspective of Bellagio's fountains!  While you wait, go to the photo booth to post a picture on Facebook or to email yourself. Decor is good with posters of grand-dad Dino's movies, and the bar drinks are named after his well-known ones (Blue Velvet, etc.) Back to the food: dinner menu.... again, absolutely perfect. House bread 'course' is amazing with great condiments, lemon creme fraiche pink salt, fried capers and a very tasty rosemary cake. If you're a lemon-head like me, this is THE PLACE. Lemon permeates many dishes and sides, such as the creme fraiche, lemon ricotta served with the side of asparagus, the signature lemon spaghetti and the (OMFG) killer Ricotta Cookies. I'm sure there's lemon elsewhere on the menu and I'll keep my eyes open for my next visit. BTW, Giada does frequent her restaurant - We visited for dinner about a month after opening and she stopped by for a great 5 minute chat where she insisted in giving me a box for my remaining Ricotta Cookie - no hollywood phonyness, just really down-to-earth casually-nice - she even posed for a photo! She took my idea of a \"Dune\" themed bar cocktail with a laugh saying that they aleady have a \"blue\" drink, but would keep it in mind - she's a hoot! Giada is located in The Cromwell - an elegant boutique hotel that complements this great restaurant, and as Giada is the only restaurant on-property, hotel guests can get room service from Giada's menu! Classy Nom! Can't wait for our next reservation!",

We had been planning this trip for a few months, so expectations were high. We were completely blown away by how far these expectations were exceeded. The actual atmosphere of the restaurant is gorgeously perfect--amazing views, lovely furnishings, even the unique table settings. But of course, the food is the headlining star. We loved every single thing we had and couldn't even decide on favorites because it was all so astonishingly delicious. We ate bruschetta, peppers stuffed with goat cheese, Gorgonzola with honey and pear slices, olives, orzo meatballs, chicken, pasta (buccatini and rigatoni) and followed it all with the perfect lemon souffle and creme anglaise. Our server, Nancy, was a wonderful part of our evening, attentively making sure we had what we needed, and helping us make our celebration special. She is a delight. So many restaurants seem focused on how quickly they can turn tables, but this felt like dining in someone's home where they invite you to stay and linger and enjoy all of it. Every person we interacted with was warm, friendly and happy and that only added to our experience.  From our table we could see the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower and enjoy the fountains at Bellagio. It was the best dining event of my life and I cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "First time at Giada's. Made the reservations months ago based on a recommendation from a reliable source. Was totally on edge after reading the recent Yelp reviews about lousy service and mediocre food because we were taking friends to dine and I basically pushed the group to eat here. I didn't want a crappy evening to sour our mood. Thank God our experience turned out great!  We arrived 20 minutes early for our 7:15pm reservation & the hostess says she can seat us right away. The hostess is totally pleasant and makes small talk while showing us to a table. Right away we are met by our server, Rocco, who proceeds to take excellent care of us right straight through from appetizer to dessert. One of us has an intolerance to onion. Undeterred, Rocco talks to the chef about each item that may or may not contain onions - we appreciated that Rocco cared enough to go that extra mile. We ordered the large antipasti for the table ($69). I love antipasti platters and this is, by far, one of the very best examples of antipasti I've ever had. We probably could have (should have?) stopped after this gargantuan platter and the bottle of Barolo ($150) but we didn't. 2 orders of Barolo Braised Waygu Beef Short Ribs ($52 each), an order of veal chop Milanese ($50?) and an order of the lemon spaghetti with shrimp, and we were stuffed to the gills. We still managed to scoff down the white coffee gelato and a plate of Giada's favorite cookies. Rocco is a sweetie. Ask to see a picture of his French Bulldog, Ginger ;-) We loved how engaging and chatty he was. He was also incredibly knowledgeable about the food, wine, cocktails, desserts...All I can say is that fantastic service makes all the difference, but combine that with fabulous food and wine and this was one of the most memorable dining experiences we've ever had. Two (or eight?) relieved, enthusiastic thumbs up.",

Loved the lemon butter, fried capers, pink salt, basil oil and red pepper flakes with mini fresh baked bread in crocks  - probably the best bread serving ever!

The eggs benny were the best ive ever had (and this is from someone living in San Francisco - I know whats good), so full of flavor, rich and delicious. Also their yogurt and chia seed parfait was to die for. Chicken and waffles - unbelievable. This is now a staple that we will visit each time were here.",

BUT worse than that, the food is unimaginative and the service is a joke.   My friend and I ordered a multi course meal - apps, salad, pasta course to share and two entrees (lamb chops and steak Milanese). About 20 minutes later, the servers arrives - WITH EVERY SINGLE COURSE IN HAND.  They start rearranging the table to fit everything.  I looked up at the lead server and asked \"what are you doing?!?  Every course together?\"  He then says, yes, that doesn't usually happen this way. Sorry - do you want me to take any of it back to the kitchen?\"  Im thinking DUH - why did you bring it out in the first place.  I was incredulous - but yes, we'd like to eat each course in order. It's and Italian restaurant. But I emphasized, PLEASE don't just put the entrees under a heat lamp. But no surprise, 30 minutes later the entrees were served to us again, warm on top, cold on the bottom. Heat lamp.   The food was mediocre and overpriced and obviously they have service issues. Luckily you have a few other choices. Unless you are a Giada fanatic, I can not imagine why you would spend your Vegas dining dollars there.",

It was a gorgeous sunny day and we walked into this big airy beautiful restaurant to find that the windows were open with fresh air pouring in. The hostesses had on the most adorable white dresses. The whole atmosphere was fresh and airy. We sat in a beautiful booth that faced the Bellagio fountains. It was a stunning view on a beautiful afternoon.  The food was good. I wouldn't say it was out of this world, but it was nice. Two in my party had pizzas, one friend had the muffuletta and the other had a pasta dish. We all enjoyed our food. My pizza was nice, but not outstanding. It was very flling, but somehow I managed to save room for dessert. I had the berry crostada which was not very flavorful. My friends had the chocolate tiramisu. I was told that this was the best dessert she had during our entire trip! I didn't get a bite because it was gone in the blink of an eye! :) My favorite part of the meal was the \"G,\" a cocktail with Giada's monogram floating in it! It was SO delicious and refreshing. They did not skimp on the alcohol either! Overall, we had a lovely experience there.",

It was a less than good cut of steak and poorly cooked. The only nice part of dinner was the wine.  We will never go back.",

    "text": "I will break this review into two sections staring with customer service.  My boyfriend and I dined at Giada's on 7/11/2015 while we were in Las Vegas for the weekend.  I had made reservations with a special request of a window table six weeks in advance.  I had been wanting to try Giada's restaurant since it opened and on our previous Las Vegas trip we were unable to get reservations.  When we showed up to our 7:30 reservation we were asked to wait for over 15 minutes, when the host did finally seat us at our table she did not apologize for the wait.  Furthermore, after waiting it was not a window seat facing the Bellagio Fountains like I had requested.  Instead we were cramped into a two person table pushed in the corner.  I kindly said that this was not what I was expecting and she said that they were no window tables available and did not know how long it would be for one.  I didn't want to make a scene so I sat down. Now, with all the choices of restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from I would think that Giada's being a new restaurant, one year old, would have spot on customer service.  On to the food, we ordered the PEI mussels which were light and a perfect starter to share along with the bread basket.  Next we ordered the arugula salad, I would try a different salad next time as the arugula was lacking in flavor but the pancetta made up for it.  Now on to the star of the meal, Tuscan Rib-Eye with a sunny side egg.  This was a 28 oz bone-in Rib-eye cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the sunny side egg was an added touch that I truly enjoyed.  The food was light yet full in flavor.  I simply which that the hospitality side of it was equal to the food.  Las Vegas has many other restaurants to choose from with the best in service and food.  I am not sure if I will be back to dine at Giada's again.",

The scallops were rubbery and under cooked and the shrimp were so over cooked and rubbery that it took a steak knife to cut them. I do have to say the chilled pea soup was outstanding. We must have picked an evening with a trainee cook filling in with the head chef taking the day off. The service was impeccable and the decor was lovely. What a disappointment, especially at $150 per person without any wine or coffee.",

    "text": "I'm pretty shocked to see so many good reviews on this place. The 3 best things are 1, location 2, the wine, cheese, meat boards and 3, the free bread. It was the best thing we ate all night. If you want a casual, and I say this because they do not enforce the dress code at all, place to have some good wine, in a beautiful location, with a light bite, this is your place.  If your looking for a good dinner, go elsewhere. It is very over priced for what you get, and to be honest, pretty bland and underwhelming. I have ate at very nice restaurants all over the world, price isn't an issue, good food is. With all that being said, the concept, start with some meats, cheeses, nuts....move onto a soup/salad....move onto a small plate of pasta...move on to the main course.....finish it with desert.. We chose to skip the meat and cheese board and went straight to the pasta course and a bottle of wine and lobster ravioli. It was 4 bites of tough cheese and pasta, rubbery bites of prawn, and a red sauce that tasted like spaghetti ohs, cost $35. Main course, I ordered the 7oz filet with basil infused mashed potatoes, cost $58 My boyfriend ordered the beef spare ribs over polenta, cost $52. My filet was grey in color, but was cooked to temp...the potatoes were very unappealing, as they were a thick pile of green, apparently from the basil? No sauce at all, so overall, pretty bland. His spareribs were tasty, but honestly, it tasted just like the pot roast I make at home for $15.  After talking with several people who had ate there before us, they all had very negative comments. One couple said the bad staff and aweful food ruined their 13 anniversary! PS, hostesses were very silly, laughing, giggling, acting like school girls, all in front of about 5 couples waiting to be seated, who all had reservations. I love Giada, but if any of these other great chefs (Ramsey, Fley, morimota, Wolfgang) ate at her restaurant, she wouldn't like the reviews...",

Every time he came to our table he seemed rushed and impersonal. After viewing the menu, we decided on three dishes to share for two of us plus a soup for each of us. Tim instantly said, \"is this all for you folks? This is a very light meal.\" After we said this was all for now, he clearly \"checked out\" and no longer gave us the quality service we expected.   Tim was hard to come by. After our four dishes we waited patiently for awhile for the fifth to come out. Tim finally visited our table to condescending say, \"Were these portions good for you?\" We instantly realized he had completely FORGOTTEN about our fifth dish.   At this point we were disappointed and asked for our check, disregarding that he had forgotten about our last dish. Tim took too long to drop off our check, which he did by throwing bluntly on the table without saying any words.    Overall negative experience. Won't be back. When you \"only\" order five dishes for two people you should still be entitled to quality and respectful service.   But the free bread was amazing.",

There were only two small shrimp but the calamari was the showcase.  I ordered the Hannibal for my drink.  This rum cocktail was delicious and the perfect size.  For my main course I had the lemon shrimp spaghetti!!!  I'm from the Gulf Coast of Florida and these really were the biggest shrimp I've ever had.  The noodles and shrimp were cooked perfectly.  If I could pick it apart a little, I wish there was more sauce on the noodles.  I little dry for my liking.   I posted pictures as well.",

Try the Sangria and the Birdie or have your server recommend a wine.    You will enjoy time spent dining",

We noticed that the lunch menu was a bit small, and upon hearing that breakfast was still offered, were still limited in choices. I opted for the muffaletta sandwich with arugula salad, my friend had the prosciutto fritatta. When my sandwich arrived, it looked like a half sandwich on flat bread...a bunch of arugula with a slice of parmesan cheese on top. Unfortunately, my sandwich was not that good. The meats and cheeses inside were great, but the bread was flat, dry and did not soak any of the olive salad that usually makes the sandwich amazing. A tad disappointing.",

The cons were the music was way too loud, you have bars and casino noise and that is expected but not at dinner, give us some music but not club like level. Also very disappointed with the desserts. How can an Italian restaurant mess up gelato ? I have had better store bought gelato less than $12? No distinctive flavor to our stracciatella and not any good quality chocolate shavings . The baked Alaska was huge disappointment with no wow factor , flavor as well, it tasted like a boxed frozen grocery store dessert item. We  decided to do 5 appetizers , our cocktails The Bellisimo was too sweet and the destroyer was basic tequila and orange juice with a basil leaf for $17 each. Entree prices are really ridiculous spaghetti $36 and steak $60? Appetizers were good. Oysters Rockefeller, charcuterie platter were great, bacon dates not so great, burrata and ricotta crostini good.",

The place was practically empty but we were told that our reservation would be honored at the appointed time and we could wait in the bar. OK, fine. We went to the bar where the bartender was warm, helpful and effusive. Soon after getting our wonderful mimosas were were called to our table.   The space is comfortable and gorgeous, made significantly less so by the too loud, completely un-brunch appropriate rock and roll music. Are we in a fine dining establishment or an Abercrombie and Fitch store??? I politely mentioned the situation to our server. She said other people have complained but there was nothing she could do. Wow.   We started with the gorgonzola dolce and burrata. Both were incredible and generously portioned. I also had a latte which was gorgeous and delicious.Two of us ordered the lobster hash, the other a frittata. The hash had potatoes, lobster, peppers, bacon and other things. It was good, but also kinda wet, not crispy like I had assumed it would be. The eggs on top were fine. The toast was served dry. When I asked for butter (really, you have to ask???) they brought little dishes of butter, nuttela and jam, all were yummy.   Good service and some great and not so great things. I'd like to try it again for dinner.",

Waited for 10-15 mins and finally had my husband ask for a drink menu because no one approached us with one and no servers arrived. We were ready to order and our table was ready. By the time we were seated we were ready for a drink! Our server was very attentive to the larger tables and took some time to get to us. We had to request bread because it didn't arrive with or before our appetizer. We ended up canceling our drink order because it took over 20 minutes to arrive. Our food was delicious though, I had the ravioli and it was amazing. We would've been more than happy to give our experience the max stars for the food alone but based on the slow and subpar service our experience was disappointing.",

Unfortunately, the minestrone soup was bland. I do not like to over salt my food, I grew up in a house with limited salt because my parents had high blood pressure, but the soup needed some salt and could have benefited from other spices as well. The first few bites of the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich were fairly bland. The prosciutto in the lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich made the dish palatable.   The best dish of the day for us were the orzo meatballs.   Our hostess kept us waiting as she seated several people who arrived after us. Unknown to us, she was waiting for an opening on the terrace that has a view of the Bellagio fountains. Nice touch. However, I don't think the wait is worth it during the day because the fountains weren't running during our stay and we had to deal with sunlight in our faces. The shades went up and down several times during our meal, it seemed like the people on the terrace wanted the shades down while others in the restaurant wanted the shades up to see the view.",

I know I sampled only one appetizer but I expected so much more from wood fired pizza.

This was not the case this evening, as I finally was hungry enough, early enough, to make it to Giada.  The entry isn't on the strip, per se, but rather up the stairs from the floor of the Cromwell at Flamingo and The Strip.  Everything was on point, from the hostess to the service.  I generally eat at the bar, but I would expect that the table service is on par as this seems to be one of those places where everyone likes their job and their coworkers.  I had the Lobster Rav/Cava,  Ricotta Crostini, Artichoke/Vermontino and Bacon Wrapped Gorgonzola Figs/Pinot Noir.  The bartender had even cleaned the espresso machine and didn't bat an eye when I jokingly asked for a doppio espresso.  Just go.  Please.  It's awesome.",

To reserve a table by the window was a $100 per person minimum requirement. The waitstaff takes a pre authorization credit card form before arriving. Ok whatever, I figured with dinner and wine we would cover that no problem. Arrive at the table and find dirty silver ware, which occurred multiple times throughout the evening. The tables are so crammed I couldn't sit without pushing and hitting the person's chair behind me. But hey I got my window seat.  Ordered two appetizers, duck prosciutto and burrata cheese. The duck was great. The cheese took 26 minutes. I asked if they made it fresh and the waiter said no it's pre made they just need to plate it. We had the tortellini  and risotto. Both were good but not amazing, which we were hoping. The portions were small which didn't bother us at all. We ordered the limoncello souffle and it tasted like scrambled eggs!  Now I know what a souffle should taste like, I order chocolate souffles all the time and I'm pretty sure it's never tasted like breakfast.  Now I never go out looking for a free meal and this experience was no different. After all this crap the manager comp'ed the dessert. Thanks for nothing Giadas!  I can't my time or my money back!  Bottom line, the Las Vegas strip wins again, a complete let down for a local but if you are here on vacation and have cash to blow and don't care about dirty silverware and are completely smashed before arriving then enjoy!",

I am a big Giada TV fan, so I was very excited to go.    To start the Cromwell hotel is dark, and very empty -even for 8pm on a Friday night .  The hostess reminded me of a typical LA hostess, barely looks at you in the eye, not very friendly and certainly not customer service oriented.     The menu was very disappointing, to start we ordered the soup   Pasta Fagiolo- they took our order, came back and said sorry - no soup left. ( Shouldnt they have known that when we ordered?)  When we continued to order the main course and asked for a few substitutions - it was actually pretty humorous- their answer was No, No , No . They were saying no before we could even ask the question!   They kept explaining that certain items were pre- made. WHAT?    They made it very clear that substitutions were not welcome.   I didn't find any of their menu choices very appetizing, and that was ironic because we walked in with a $250.00   food comp.  I ordered a  mini Pizza -can I get goat cheese on it ? NO we don't have crumbles. But you have Goat Cheese on the menu- NO. The Pizza reminder me of a Lean Cuisine Pizza, that was the exact size..  Overall, with all of the fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I would pass on this. Absolutely nothing like I expected - the service or the food quality. We left and went to  a French  restaurant, received fantastic service, enjoyed amazing food and wondered why we didn't go there in the beginning.",

    "text": "As an Italian native I was so disappointed in the taste of the food. Presentation is a 4-5 desert a 5. Everything else is cooked with way too much salt and butter. Lemon zest is almost in every plate. I was sadly disappointed. Traditional Italian dishes are buttered down with a strange lemony flavoring. My fiance enjoyed the $60 steak I enjoyed the chocolate tart. I would never go back to this restaurant though. It's over priced and sadly disappointing. Service is a 4.",

    "text": "This was a tough experience with some really good food last Saturday night.  With much excitement and anticipation I went here with a group for a birthday.  The contract for the private room had been signed months prior and when we arrived the table was set for 16 and we had 20 guests.  To make matters worse, we only had one server and I got my first cocktail after my 3rd request more than 30 minutes after arrival.  The wife of the \"birthday boy\" made the mistake of breaking out in tears and asking to see the manager and I personally witnessed his rudeness.  After placing his hand just inches from her face, he told her she needed to \"back off\"  and told her she was out of bounds.  After many years in the restaurant business I can confidently say he needs to be fired.   The food was anywhere from good to incredibly scrumptious.  Antipasto was fabulous as were the all the first courses from chicken meatballs marsala to beef shoulder cured in red wine that was ridiculously savory and delicious.  The bone in rib eye was off the charts and the giant prawns and pasta were really good.  Our solitary waitress for a party of 20 did the best she could and reinforcements finally showed up to help about mid-way through dinner but the entire experience was severely tarnished by a bad first impression and a thoughtlessly rude manager.    As an aside, the party's host and hostess had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day and reminded them about the increase in guests and a member of our party who  was staying at the hotel and also mentioned the problem to management earlier in the day to no avail.  Someone had the audacity to bring up a contract that had been signed over a year prior that had multiple \"amendments\" that apparently never found their way to the manager on duty.  Sadly enough I will have to favor B&B on future Vegas visits for their excellent food and superior attitude and service.",

FOOD: The pasta menu was limited for lunch, but the pasta was amazing as its reputation suggested. However, the other items were hit or miss. For instance, my smashed potatoes were burnt and bland, but the bread was soft and tasty.    SERVICE: Our waiter was inattentive. He didn't come around much to check on us, and our water glasses were often empty. We ordered alcoholic drinks, but they were brought out after the appetizers were served. This timing was disappointing.  AMBIANCE: The highlight of the restaurant is the beautiful space. It's bright, elegant, and welcoming.   OVERALL:  Although the food was fine, the service left us with an awkward experience that none of us would seek out again.",

    "text": "***BEWARE*** They charge you a RIDICULOUS amount for \"sparking water and \"bottled\" water\" (Yes, I did 2 quotes, cuz it's a lie and rip off). There were 8 of us (at one table and 10 at another) and the waiters charged us for 8 bottles of water. (I am assuming 1 bottle per guest). Guess what that cost, $64! SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS FOR WATER. And, when we got the bill, it was the first line item. He did that before we even ordered our food. We drank NO WHERE near 8 bottles of the water but whatever. For this alone, I wont come back. I made sure to put it on the survey you are able to leave when you get the bill.  On to the food......was let down to put it nicely. food, eh. i like her recipes, i've tried literally, a hundred, and i was so diappointed that this food was just eh. nothing stood out as amazing. it was good, for sure but not amazing. fell short in my opinion. We ordered the large antipasta. It was good, but not spectacular. We all ordered entree's and or a bunch of appetizers for dinner. Again, nothing really stood out. It was OK, but I like her recipes from her show SO much better.  The handling of reservations was also a fiasco. There were 18 of us and reservations were made weeks in advance. They were pushing us to get a tasting menu that everyone had to order from (it didn't look great). We were finally allowed to get 2 tables, 1 for 8 and 1 for 10 but it seemed like a lot of work went into that. Dont you people WANT money to pay the bills? You wanna bust balls when 18 people want to come here and eat your food? So between, the water charge bullshit, the reservations annoyance, and the lackluster food, I wouldn't come back. I also think it sucks that they didn't contact me after I did the survey. I guess they dont care if customers are happy or not.  What would Aunt Raffey think?",

    "text": "I watch the Food Network all the time, and I always wonder what it would be like to have some of my favorite personalities cook for me.  Since Giada doesn't have a restaurant in every major city, I figured that dining here would be as close as I could get.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  You would think that you would hear a lot of noise from the strip below, but it really doesn't make its way up to the dining room.  The music may be turned up a little to cover this.  Unfortunately, our waiter was soft-spoken and it was a struggle to hear him.  He also seemed really disinterested in talking to us - he explained the menu as briefly as possible and was gone.  We ordered several appetizers first.  Most of these were decent - nothing spectacular.  The one bright spot was the ricotta crostini.  This was amazing - even for cheese on bread.  What was really disappointing, however, was when the wait-staff removed our appetizer plates without asking us if we were still working on them.  They took food off of the table without asking if we were finished.  The entree sizes are small.  I guess since we technically ordered pasta dishes and not \"entrees\" we should have expected this.  Everyone at my table had the risotto which they liked well enough.  I had the pappardelle which was also good enough.  I personally think the noodles were too thick and not wide enough  - and a little chewy.  If the pasta dishes were priced $5-$7 lower these would be above average.  If the dishes were $10 cheaper they would be amazing.  For what they cost, however, they were just ok.  So much hype, not enough follow through.  For the prices she is charging, we should at least get some free cleavage shots like on TV.  I think the thing that amazed me the most about this restaurant is how fast our dishes came out.  The overwhelming impression that I got is that they were trying to turn tables as fast as possible.  Not only are they being greedy by over-charging, but they're double dipping by rushing people through.  For shame, Giada.",

The photo booth was a nice touch but probably due to the long wait to be seated.  Once we got seated it then took them forever to even greet us or ask if we wanted water.  I had to flag our waiter to ask for water and get some appetizers in. Amongst 7 women we ordered about 5 entrees and 4 appetizers and everything but the fattoh and rib eye steak was tasteless and not very good especially the risotto which I had to send back.  Being I chose this restaurant I was very embarrassed and apologized to my girlfriends for such a bad Taste and experience Giada left in their minds not to mention the money they spend. I literally thought we were getting punked and Aston Kutcher was going to come out but we sure got punked $700 instead.",

Translate that into we are trying to see how many people we can cram into this place tonight. As suggested, we went to the bar only to be ignored by the bartenders. Finally got a drink ordered and they came for our seating before it came. Wouldn't put it on our dinner tab so had to wait to close out the bar check. Our waiter was not very attentive and his accent was so thick we couldn't understand him. The roar from the street didn't help. Loud motorcycles and fire trucks. They finally closed the windows and that helped a little. The prices were steep, even for Vegas. $30 for a 4 oz. pasta course that the waiter made sure to tell us should not be our main course. Starters and pasta came out in a reasonable time frame but waiting almost an hour for the entree is unacceptable. When we asked, the waiter was gone 10 minutes only to return and say our entrees were being plated and would be there in \"one minute\". After about ten minutes we were about to leave when the food arrived. Never an explanation or apology. Water glasses were frequently empty. Waiter never checked on us. We always had to flag him down. It was almost like the waiter was upset we didn't order more when our tab for 4 was $400 before gratuity.  Even so, it appeared to be a management issue because other guests were being treated similarly.  Such a disappointment.",

Michelle was very attentive & took exceptional care of us. We were later greeted by Ricardo, who works for Caesar's entertainment group. He made us feel very welcome & later introduced the restaurant's general manager, Michael Speagle, who extended the hospitality. Every dish we ordered was fantastic & the dessert topped it all off. Our favorites were the white coffee gelato & flourless chocolate cake... Although we tried almost everything & they all tasted amazing.

The decor was very nice and created a very high expectation for a great experience. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and then while waiting for our table we ordered drinks at the bar. We were seated in a nice booth and then we waited and waited some more (we contemplated getting up and leaving, but I really wanted to try the food here). Once we were attended to and given menus, we started with some pizzas (Carbonara & Salumi Piccante), which were SO good (4 star). Then we waited and waited and waited and waited....at this point we REALLY contemplated heading out. But we stuck it out because we were entertained by Giada walking around the restaurant. She didn't make it to our table though. So three of us ordered off the brunch sampler menu which included three items, a starter (pastry assortment or devilled eggs or Brussel sprouts crostini), a main course (salmon cakes benedict, lasagna or chicken and waffle), and then a dessert (souffle or chocolate espresso tower or cookie ice cream sandwich). I tried the gnocchi. Tasty and delicious but this meal lasted a loooooooong 3 hours, which was a turn off. Next time, we plan to hit up the bar for prompt service.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined at Giada's for the first time to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary; I'm a fan of her cooking show.  The place is super smoky; all of the cigarette smoke comes right up the escalator and settles in the restaurant.  The view is beautiful if you are lucky to get a seat near the window.  The servings are SUPER small.  To start, the waiter gave us one small roll to share with various dipping options (i.e. pesto, capers, parmesan, etc.)  Then we ordered the Chicken Marsala meatballs to share, which meant we each got 2.5 small meatballs; I liked the sweet taste of them.  The waiter said something to my husband about how we're supposed to order course after course to fill up because the portion sizes are small, but doing this would cost a small fortune.  I ordered the crab arancini and liked it, and my husband ordered the rigatoni and hated it. He said it had a hamburger helper taste to it.  Overall, the menu is lacking variety.  Everything has lemon in it (i.e. the rolls, the potatoes, the arancini, the cookies, etc.) or it has fish in it (the ravioli was made with lobster, the arancini with crab, the spaghetti came with shrimp. etc.)  We also ordered dessert, and it was by far the worst and most expensive dessert we've ever had.  The cookie plate was disgusting!  The chocolate chip cookie (if you can call it that) was greasy and it had no taste, and my husband thought that the lemon cookie was inedible.  I would say that if you're a fan of Giada's show or cookbooks, this place is worth a one time visit; just go knowing that the portions are tapas small for a big price.",

We also partook of using their photo-booth at the waiting area of the restaurant. Customer front service were young ladies, they were gracious. Our server was a french dude, who was also very nice and welcoming. The manager also made sure that my 3 year-old son is comfortable, he was given a portable dvd player so that he can watch a movie. That was very nice. Since they're relatively new, we were asked a couple of times on how we were doing. While it is a family restaurant, unlike a typical Italian restaurant their servings are portioned, meaning it is a fine dining serving. It was expected, but mind you their food was flavorful. We loved everything we ordered, from the antipasti, entree and dessert, food was fabulous. Dining experience was superb, if you hit Vegas on your next trip, do try Giada's!",

    "text": "We arrived 5 mins early for our 8pm reservation. We were told the restaurant was running behind and it would be at least a 15min delay. After we were seated a waiter came to our table. He took a moment to introduce himself in not the most welcoming way. I asked if he could take a quick picture of us because we were excited to be there. In the most rude way possible he said... not now because he had food coming out of the kitchen. Now it's fine if you're busy, but there is a way to say it in a nice manner. I don't think I have ever had someone be so rude to me at a restaurant. Especially when I was about to pay $150 a person. As for the food... NOTHING came out hot or even warm. Everything was room temp. We put our entree orders in around 8:30pm and did not get served them until after 10pm. We were told that the kitchen was running way behind because it was a new menu. And during all of this not one time did someone come over and offer us a glass of champagne, desert or anything. You go to almost any restaurant and your order is that behind a manager will come out and apologize. I can't imagine that this is the image Giada wants for her restaurant. Major disappointment!",

There aren't many places I would return to based solely on guest service, but Giada's is one of them. Katie (our bartender) created drinks from scratch based on our tastes and we enjoyed them all. We even had a drink from the barback, Max, that was phenomenal. Thank you so much for the fantastic experience! We'll be back soon!",

I have all of giadas books and have followed her for years. Go to Ferraro's on paradise for a truly amazing meal. The ambiance was fantastic, one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever seen with the best view of the strip. But when you live here in town you get very spoiled by all of the great restaurants. Also typical Vegas, it gets too crowded and the quality control goes down. Most of our food was cold instantly because of the open windows and you can tell it sat around before it was dropped off. The signature Giada cocktail was warm. We asked for ice cubes, and they actually brought us a bucket of ice instead of making a freshly chilled drink. And what's the deal with being booked on open table from 5-10 pm Every night when it wasn't even all that busy?! Any time we voiced complaints or concerns to the server(s), they listened attentively then gave some explanation saying \"that's the way Giada likes it\", and masterfully ignored us. Apple tart was nearly raw, I could have made a better pizzette at home, lobster Arancini had no flavor. Orzo meatballs were good and so was the bucatini. But they were just good, nothing spectacular. If you rarely go out for a nice dinner you will probably enjoy it there. Not impressed at all.",

This year was it was a great disappointment. I had to leave my seat and look for someone to refill my coffee after a 10 min wait for my wait staff to recognize I needed a refill. It took 45 min for my meal to arrive it was cold had sat under lites so long the prosciutto pilled on top of my frittata was crisp and dry. I pointed this out to my waitress. She wished it away and returned with the same cold frittata with fresh prosciutto???? I had to ask for a fresh entree. The toast used to be a special as well now it's a thin dry slice. Because it's a birthday they usually bring a nice little delicious dessert cookie... not this time. The service is typically outstanding, not on this visit. A great disappointment on a special day.",

    "text": "The mantra of our dinner here is \"Happily Ever After starts with the souffle.\" I will first begin with the negative aspects of our experience. As I always try to end on a good note. We had a reservation for 3 at 515pm on Saturday Sept 2nd. We were greeted with no smiles from the hostesses. We payed a compliment, \"I love your matching dresses!\" Complete with a big smile. So you would understand my shock/disdain/embarassment when not even one of the three hostesses smiled or said thank you. We shrugged it off and continued to enjoy ourselves at the photo booth. We were promptly showed to our table which was a spacious booth with a perfect view of the strip. I was hoping to catch the live music that the restaurant's website promises on weekends begining at 6pm. Again I spoke with the lovely hostess and asked her if there would be live music. She looked at me like I was confused and said \"um I dont know. I think its on weekends. I can definitely find out for you.\" Needless to say I didnt see her again. Instead of live music there was an unfitting playlist consisting of Justin Timberlake (we heard sexy back played twice). Maybe some jazz or Norah Jones-esque vibe would have been more fitting. And finally, the pizette needed to be returned because it was burnt to a crisp on the bottom. So! With those things being said, I did want to give the food and atmosphere 5 stars. But I absolutely MUST account for those things because it really does effect the overall experience. Now for what really matters. And thats the fact that Giada's flavor profiles and presentations did not dissapoint. You cannot simply order a pasta and expect to grasp the True greatness of her menu. Order some antipassti and dont forget desert. I will let my photos speak for themselves. The food was absolutely phenomenal! I can't wait to come back. My favorites were the burrata and the spaghetti. Everything was fresh and the flavors were multi dimensional. You absolutely must come. I also cannot bring this review to an end without mentioning our server, Turley. He instantly turned around the negative start to our experience. We quickly connected with him as he once lived in the same area as us. He was funny and helpful and complimented me on my tattooes. He did his job by upselling but at the same time he wasnt pushy or uptight. I really think Giada's front end team can learn a lot from him. Thank you so much, Turley! You truly made our dining experience great!!",

I walked into the semi mostly empty restaurant and was greeted by someone behind the counter.  She arrived about 9 minutes later.  She had a difficult time figuring out where to seat us.  Go figure.  An empty restaurant...  The waitress arrived and felt as though we were an inconvenience. I felt as though she was doing us a favor.  I would have left then, but my wife likes the Giada.  Our waitress arrived and the feeling of you are wasting my time continued.  She was not familiar with the menu and couldn't answer simple questions. I love buratta and asked for some.  The waitress went into an overly detailed explanation on how I had to order it.  I asked for a recommendation and her delivery was flat like ordering at a fast food court.  How we had to select from one of three antipasti selections.  Why is it so difficult to get some cheese....  Both of us ordered the burger.  Normally the antipasti arrive and you have some time to enjoy it before the main meal arrives.  In approximately 7 minutes and the burgers arrived.  Mine came out MW when I asked for MR  & my wife's R that came out WD.  Her egg was way overdone. Refire.  Need I say more?  The meal was mediocre in every way.  I finished half of the burger and focused on the antipasti. The busser was fantastic.  He was the best thing in the restaurant.  The waitress should reconsider her career.  There are many other great places to dine in Vegas.  I wouldn't put this on any list to visit.  Food Network Disaster.",

We were greeted and seated at our exact reservation time.  Our waiter for the evening was excellent.  He was phenomenal with his knowledge of the menu and what goes into each dish.  There was no shortage of suggestions from our enthusiastic waiter.    A complimentary bread basket was brought to the table filled with several types for everyone to enjoy.  One was a small baked bread dish with amazing flavor.  It almost looked like a bread muffin but easily sliced.  Three spreads were accompanying the bread including an amazing pesto.  Loved that! The drink menu was easily browsed on a tablet which included what was in each specialty drink.  I'll just say the La Strada is awesome! I'd describe it as a spritzy light adult lemonade.  Fabulous!   I chose the Risotto topped with crab and scallops.  Creamy and filled with the perfect amount of seafood.  I'd highly recommend this dish to anyone.  And of course we couldn't skip dessert. I had the lemon cake topped with a chocolate ganache.  Yum. The lemon and chocolate flavors were perfectly balanced.  I loved it.  Plus I had a bite of my husbands delicious molten lava cake.    I'd also like to highlight the manager Michael who recognized me from a Yelp event almost a year ago.  I was pretty impressed and flattered with his memory of me.  A big thank you to Michael for topping off a memorable dinner.    Every part of this dining experience was great.  I'm already excited to come back to Giada's.  It was perfection.",

The oysters were warm, I wouldn't eat them and came with some nasty jelly on the side. I ordered risotto and I took one bite and sent it back. It was rock hard, bland and had maybe 3/4 ounces of food. My wife had the chicken. It was ok, but no salt or spice to it. Just boring fried chicken. The arancini balls looked good, but under delivered. Again no flavor. The cookies for dessert were average maybe Costco quality and zero flair. They made one good thing and that was some Nutella dessert. If you give this place five stars you should have your yelp page removed from you, as you don't know anything about food.",

Furnishings are appropriate. It has a large bar which can be active and noisy.    We had a late lunch, so we were not all that hungry. Still, we wanted to try Giada for the experience.  We both rated the food 3 stars.  Service from Timothy D was 4 stars.    Now, back to the food.  We ordered the Crab Dip as an appetizer.  It tasted more like tuna fish.  The more we ate it the more we thought it was Tuna.  It wasn't, but it sure tasted like it.  Overall 3 stars only.  It was $18.  When I pay this much for an appetizer I want something special. This was not.  It also seemed to be greasy.   Next we ordered Lobster Ravioli.  It was properly presented but it was swimming in butter and cream.  Of course we can splurge off our diets but the butter really came through, in an overwhelming way. Cost: $36. I would say this meal is overpriced. It should be in the low $20 dollar range.  Again, not remarkable enough to warrant the cost.   We will return in time. There are so many better restaurants that we want to try in Vegas first.  Total bill with 1 glass of wine and 1 mixed drink was $101.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to try this place out since it first opened and have always been a huge Giada fan. My boyfriend really got it right this time by surprising me with a dinner here for our one year anniversary.   Ambiance: I really enjoyed that the entrance had its own personal escalators to walk in which made it more secluded from the rest of the casino. The decorations were nice as well, kind of an upscale rustic look. They also had a photo booth available in the waiting area, but we didn't get a chance to use it. Once seated at the table I enjoyed that we still had a nice view of the strip, but was a bit disappointed in the atmosphere. I thought it would be a bit more romantic but it seemed like a mix of families, business meetings and dates. I also would have liked the tables to be further apart and more private.  Food: I honestly loved everything we ordered. To start we had a complementary bread arrangement with came with a few breadsticks, crispy flat bread and rosemary potted bread. This also came with toppings like butter, red pepper flakes, capers and sea salt. I sampled each of the bread choices and each one was very good. For an appetizer we had the fritto miso. The calamari was delicious, probably the best I've ever had in my life. The shrimp was also cooked perfectly too. The only downside on this dish was the amount of sauce to dip in didn't go a very long way. Next I had the romaine salad which was very good. The dressing was very light, but delicious. My boyfriend had the chopped tricolore salad which he said was very good as well. For entrees I went with the spaghetti. I really enjoyed the subtle hints of lemon and most of all the perfectly cooked prawns. My boyfriend went with the surf and turf. The steak was delicious, super tender and topped with a very tasty sauce. He also really enjoyed the asparagus and mashed potato sides. For dessert we received a couple complimentary cookies. I really liked the lemon cookie, but didn't care as much for the chocolate peanut butter one.  Overall I was very satisfied with this visit and am very glad I got to finally try it out. I highly recommend this place for any special occasion.",

With so many places to eat and choose from in LV, do not let your visit go by without trying Giada.  From our Rose to the end with birthday celebratory cookies for my friend.  Everyone/thing was superb. They had me at bread - with those delightful array of toppings. We had the stuffed dates and lemon ricotta crostini, then shared the pasta sampler. It was perfect for the two of us. We will certainly return to sample other items.  Everything fresh and homemade.  You won't be disappointed.  Congrats Giada and staff.",

The view is breathe taking over the strip, we watched the Bellagio fountains all night.   Cocktails- were ok. I had something with champagne but honestly I wish I had picked wine because the food has enough flavors so my sweet cocktail was throwing it off.   A must - the antipasto platter - just do it! Roasted ricotta stuffed peppers where perfect grilled and the quality of cheeses overall is divine. There was medley of mushrooms that I could have eaten all night. Bacon wrapped dates, olives, and the crostinis are so intricate it will blow your mind.   Mains:  Lobster ravioli- done in a light lemon olive oil over spinach. Fantastic and a refreshing change from a heavy cream sauce.   Prawn pasta - must have! It was a tad heavy on salt but a house hit and rightfully so.   Rack of Lamb- I'd get this next time. Tasted my mom's and it was so well flavored - no gamey taste at all!   Surf and Turf- if you love steak the sauce on this is was something I've never experienced. Like a cherry wine sauce - Devine!   Good luck getting a reservation but man she's worth the hassle!!",

Back waiter was awesome at keeping my water filled- which is why review is not a 1 star. Food...huge decline!!! Started with calamari, which includes shrimp. Lemon aioli was delish, shrimp was incredibly overlooked! No one checked on us while we ate, so didn't get a chance to tell anyone before plates were cleared away. Main entrees- risotto with scallops. Super excited as told by others this was a specialty. Had to send scallops back to kitchen, WAY undercooked. Raw and gummy. As in make you sick rAw! Server brought out new ones after meal was finished, very oily in preparation, but at least cooked. Date had spaghetti with shrimp. Same issue as app, shrimp WAY over cooked. Again, we were hungry and ate them, but not pleased. Didn't really want to express displeasure as already \"complained\" about one thing... But with all the options in this city, Giada's left a lot to be desired. Not sure how or why it went down hill so badly! Oh yea, when making reservation, asked for a window and said was a birthday dinner, when checked in....told Windows only for guests spending 100 or more per person even tho one window table sat empty our whole visit...and no mention of birthday either.

    "text": "Oh man, I was pumped to get to Giada's.  Let's begin by saying its Vegas and prices on the strip are high. If you choose to eat at the restaurants here, you're paying a premium. We know that and are completely ok with it. Giada's was no exception.  The restaurant is lovely but we missed out on any type of view as our table was tucked into a corner. We started in the bar with a cocktail that was well made. Once to our table, we were greeted by our server who was very pleasant. The bread was good...I found the focaccia to be nice and spongy but just ok. The different spreads were a nice touch.  After choosing a nice glass of red, we started with caponata and burrata. I am a burrata freak but remarkably, this was again, just ok. Not as creamy as I would have liked. The caponata was good. I did enjoy the taste but this is an example of being disappointed in the price ratio.  We went with pasta because, really, life is all about pasta. Lemon shrimp and pork ragu. The portions were plenty and our server was kind enough to bring plates so we could share both dishes. We felt that the pork was the favorite. More flavor and well balanced. The shrimp in the spaghetti were huge and succulent but the sauce was not what I was hoping for. I imagined a bright, lemony sauce that was light and fresh. This seemed a bit muddled or heavy. It didn't sing and for the price tag, it should have been a soprano!  I enjoy cooking and make some great food so when I'm paying for it, I suppose I expect to taste something I can't do in my own kitchen.  I will say, our moment there was very relaxed and comfortable. We were not rushed, the pacing was perfect and they allowed us to linger over our wine. This is very important to me in a dining experience. Unfortunately, I probably won't return in the future. However, I remain a huge fan of Giada and all she does.",

I made reservations which were easy to get if you call direct on noT use online features. We had a party of 7 and they were happy to have us. We arrived early and waited in the reception area and had some cocktails which were reasonably priced for a Hotel restaurant. After a short time we were seated and the staff was quick to get our drink orders and waters. (because that is key). I wish that bread was brought before we ordered but that is not the case here. Our table was just off the main room and a little in the traffic area but it was comfortable. I have to say the chairs were soft and not what expected at a restaurant. I ordered the ice tea and thought it was a Cirque performance just to drink it. pour from one pot to another pot to a glass of ice. I just want ice with tea. Table was not roomy enough for this spectacle, but nicely done. The rundown on the food. As a whole we ate a little of everything except for any of the antipasti. Josie and I shared the Rib Eye(not sure why I do this to Myself). Came with a giant bone and easy for 2 to share. I dig the egg on top. HOWEVER. I truly will always have a difficult time paying crazy prices for a steak I can make at home at half the cost. If the steak was high 20 to low 30 range fine but for how it tasted I was not happy with cost. (yes I make a pretty mean steak) Steak rant over. Sides, smashed potatoes and sweet corn with sausage. The corn was incredible. Sweet flavor followed by this awesome heat bite from the sausage. Almost a smokey flavor as well. great side I need to learn how is made. Lemon smashed potatoes, smooth citrus taste with a buttery type finish. A must have if you do eat here. That was our meal also eaten that night was risotto, tortellini and salmon. Had a bite of each but nothing was a standout for me. for dessert we had the cookie trio that as far as the lemon cookies go my wife can do better. Yes, its pretentious, but her lemon cookies are awesome.  I may go again. I can say try it out, food was good, staff was great. Very attentive and knowledgable.",

    "text": "My review of Giada pt 2: After my experience with this restaurant  last night I wanted to give a REAL review hoping that the manager and even Giada herself  would read this... I have been a long time fan of Giada  & was super excited to have the chance to eat at her restaurant.  After finally arriving at the restaurant  last night, I checked in with the greeter and was asked if I wanted to go in early since my wife &  I arrived early. My wife checked that the dress attire for the restaurant  is \"business casual\"  based on their website. I was wearing blue shorts &  a capped sleeved (  very short, short sleeved) Guess hooded sweater.  While waiting to be seated, another woman who didn't  introduce herself came from inside  the restaurant  & told me  that there was a dress code &  I wouldn't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  Being that I wasn't staying at the Cromwell, that was not something I could do.  I told this woman that I have been  a long time fan of Giada since her cooking show days and all I wanted to do was eat dinner at Giada 's restaurant for my wife' s bday.  All I wanted was a little customer service and to be pardoned for my capped sleeve shirt. She just turned her head,  gave me a  fake smile  that read \"that's  nice but I really don't give a shit\"  &  proceeded with telling me that I still won't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  She said I had \"torn off sleeves\"  and that was the problem. .  but mind you..  my shirt is once again CAPPED Sleeve that  go pass my shoulders and it was a Guess brand.  It was not a $10 ripped tank top from old Navy as she implied. While this is all happening, I notice  3 or 4 guys go inside to eat with blue shorts on and  t-shirts.  So here is my question...  What was the difference  between what I had on and THEIR outfits ????    I get that there's a dress code and rules like this need to be followed by the people  who conduct this business.  What I  didn't  appreciate was the condescending  approach and how that woman made me feel that this snobby atmosphere  is something that they're  trying to uphold & that me and my capped sleeved shirt don't have a place in there.  (Imagine that \"Pretty Woman\" scene w/Julia Roberts  when she was dressed as a hooker and that snobby lady didn't wanna help her because of how she looked.. All Julia wanted was to buy a nice dress and she had $$$!!)   I thought that as a fan of Giada  (who this woman  probably  didn't  even know  of until she worked at the restaurant) AND as a paying customer that  a few  more inches of length  on my sleeves  wouldn't  be so  significant. I was naive. I had to seriously re-evaluate  being a fan because her establishment represents her like THIS.  I'm sure your food is extraordinary  (I can only imagine it in the pictures because I didn't  get to taste it!!)  But your customer service  needs a SERIOUS upgrade!!!",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I told myself I would write more reviews for this last foray to my favorite city, but writing a review for Giada is tough.  There are equal amounts of pluses and minuses in my mind....and the fact that Giada DeLaurentis is my fantasy woman (don't tell the wife) makes this review especially difficult, but here goes.  You need to make reservations well ahead of time.  Right now, this restaurant seems to be the hottest thing around and even calling a month ahead only got us a 10:15 p.m. reservation.   The Cromwell seems nicely redone.  Leaving our taxi, we walked through the casino to the escalator leading straight up to Giada.  It was bustling even at 10:00.  While we waited, we took advantage of her photo booth-a definite thumbs up!  The restaurant, like the woman, is beautiful and so......tasteful.  Should we expect less?  Our table gave us a partial view of Caesar's and the Bellagio. Clientele were well dressed except for one party of 4 dudes in shorts, jerseys, and baseball caps worn backwards.    Giada opened her windows, letting in the cool fall air.  Good in theory, but a few things worked against the ambience.  First of all, the restaurant was a bit noisy considering the beautiful people dining....ahem.  On this night, sirens cut through the restaurant every few minutes.  (We found out later that a distubance had occurred downtown.)  Our waiter seemed to know his stuff and had a wry demeanor I liked.  The problem was his timing was not in synch with ours.  For instance, he was ready to take our drink orders when we were still deciding between a red or a white to go along with our food.  When we decided, he was gone.  I know we could have used the iPad, but neither the wife nor I could get it to go where we wanted it.  In general, everything was a little slow....ordering, drinks, food, coffee, check.  We were always waiting......  The food was perplexing.  Servings were small, but ingredients were quality.  Tastes were innovative, but not necessarily what I wanted.  For instance, I imagined the Crispy Oysters Rockefellers would be spinachy, cheesy, and bacony, with a rich sauce that I thought would be crisped up somehow.  (My vocabulary is growing!)  Now maybe I'm wrong, but although the oysters were fresh, they were cooked in what tasted like a mignonette sauce (wine vinegar).  I think the crispy part was the bacon.  So it was refreshing and different, but not what I was looking for.  The same thing happened with her spaghetti with shrimp.  I wasn't expecting that much lemon so the first bite surprised me. The rich. cheesy pasta needs to be eaten hot. It grew on me as I ate and while you might think there isn't enough shrimp, they are quite large and cooked perfectly.  I should have asked more questions about each dish.....at least then I wouldn't have been off balance so much.  I would give the food 4 stars, but service gets only 3 stars for all the waiting......I still love you, Giada.......",

When we finished dinner and asked for dessert menus our table was dirty and they never wiped it before setting our clean dessert setups down. So when our desserts came to the table there were chunks of cauliflower and onions on our table. Not OK. Check came and table still not wiped. I watched a hostess shoot breath spray in her mouth in the middle of the dining room while waiters were first bumping each other...I might expect this at cheesecake factory but this place should be a higher standard. Top notch restaurants in this city where service is outstanding and a lot of attention to detail.",

For our reservation we were sat right on time with the requested window table. Menus were delivered to the table right away, and drinks were taken after we had a minute to view the menu.  Our server, Nancie, was right on time with everything.  From the timing of appetizers to wine and bread, all was perfect.  She was completely fine with us taking our time between courses, even when we had the best seat in the house overlooking the fountains.   My wife and I had a couple different orders of crustini (both which were great), oysters, and finished with Spaghetti and Ravioli.  When we placed our order for the pasta, we asked Nancie if she could put that order in after we had a bit to enjoy the view and our cocktails, and she was great to do so.  I also asked her for a nice full bodied glass of wine that she would recommend, not wanting to review the menu again, and she was quick with exactly what i was looking for.  Our pasta and sides (sweet corn and potatoes) were perfect and the experience was great,  Ended dinner with one of the best cups of  double espresso i have ever had.   This place was top notch with service, food quality and expectation.  Nothing missed on taste, presentation, and timing.",

    "text": "Well, that was disappointing.  My husband and I came here to celebrate our 7th anniversary after finally scoring a reservation at a reasonable hour. We'd heard mixed reviews and lots of bad ones regarding the service, but we generally care more about food than service anyway so didn't pay much attention.  The main positive at Giada is the food. Bread was good. For the first time ever, we actually finished everything on a salumi & formaggi plate. It was delicious! The tortellini was fantastic, as was the chocolate tart that few restaurants get right. My husband's bucatini was good (but not unique), but being so upset about other aspects of the experience, he won't admit it.  Now the negatives. First, we had to wait an extra 10 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. This wouldn't be so bad if it was the only problem. But when we were finally seated, it was in the crappiest seat in the back room. So much for the cool atmosphere.  The hostess and our first server both wished us a happy anniversary and were pleasant enough. However, after taking our order, we never saw our server again. The salumi and formaggi platter came out quick enough, but it was about 45 minutes before we got our tortellini and risotto. Only problem was we didn't order risotto. It should've been bucatini. When we told the next employee who finally walked by our table, he said he'd tell someone but no apology. A new server (we were never informed our old one was gone) came out to say they would get the bucatini ready, but we could snack on the risotto. Well, I don't like scallops, and my husband is in the process of finding out about a possible shellfish allergy, so we weren't doing that. Still no apology.  I tried to put off eating my tortellini but didn't want it to get cold so ate it in very slow motion. Long after I finished it and it was taken away, the bucatini finally arrived. Once my husband started eating it, the server apologized and said the first waitress entered the ticket incorrectly. At this point, my husband's mood was ruined.  Once he was finished, the server said he was checking with the manager to see if we could get a free dessert, which she approved. Most upscale restaurants-- or even Applebee's for that matter-- give us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary anyway, so that offer was annoying. Maybe they don't do that there though, so whatever.  What I know they DO do is at least write \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate, but that didn't happen for us. The chocolate tart was very tasty though, and I was happy they weren't afraid of making it super sweet. The manager came over later to apologize and tell us the dessert would be complimentary. Yeah, yeah, we know. She seemed nervous and like this was her first restaurant job.  The only attentive part of the service was the guy who constantly kept my water glass full. I saw a woman at another table drop her clutch, and instead of handing it to her or saying something (she hadn't noticed), the busser kept kicking it under her table without acknowledging it out loud.  Also, when leaving a good restaurant, employees generally step aside to let customers pass. At Giada, I almost got mowed down by the busboy.  The food was really impressive, but the unprofessional service (or lack thereof) was a huge turn-off and made the constant waiting not really worth the time. Some of the issues were minor, but the way they were dealt with was immature and not standard in a high end restaurant. I doubt we'll be back. Luckily, we have another anniversary reservation at CUT tomorrow, where we can rely on service that matches the food.",

    "text": "I waited weeks for a dinner reservation and on the evening that I was finally able to dine here, the service was impeccable, the setting was beautiful, and the cuisine was no exception! The entire dinner was about 3 hours long, but it was a delightful 3 hours because the setting, the wait staff, the food, the cocktails, and the company I was keeping were key components to my enjoyment that evening. The bread board is delicious and consists of focaccia and cracker breads and is served with 5 spreads; lemon butter and pesto were my favorite spreads. Burrata cheese with Balsamic salt and chicken Marsala meatballs were the appetizers we chose and we  did not regret our choices! There are many great selections on the general menu, but we decided to go with the tasting menu. An antipasti plate with bacon wrapped dates, cheese-stuffed peppers and tuna tar-tar crostinis start you off, followed by a second course of your choice of either lemon spaghetti or vegetable Bolognese. I selected lemon spaghetti because I make lemon spaghetti at home and naturally, I had to try it at Giada for comparison...it was great---as is my own if I do say so myself ;-). The third course is a choice of either salmon on a bed of summer succotash with whole grain mustard (my choice and it was delicious), or Sicilian roasted Colorado lamb (I tried a bite---also delicious), or Farroto with fava and morels. The sides were smashed lemon potatoes and a dish of sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage...they did not disappoint! The tasting menu was very filling...AMPLE portions! If you go with the tasting menu, you can select 5 desserts from the dessert cart. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of one dessert that I particularly enjoyed; although, the lemon ricotta cookie was another favorite from the dessert cart. I left with the recipes for the lemon ricotta cookie, and two pasta dishes, which were a gift if you ordered the tasting menu...I was tickled pink to get that cookie recipe presented in a special Giada envelope and an autographed Giada photograph. This might not matter to some, but I thought it was a unique touch that I've not been offered at other restaurants. On your way in or out of Giada, note that there is a small room with a black curtain by the escalator...it is a complimentary Giada photo booth! Be sure to take advantage of this complimentary feature and take home a souvenir photo strip...the machine will shoot out two copies for you to preserve the memory of your visit there! :-)",

We started out with some coffee and the pastry basket, which took another 15 minutes to get to the table. Ordered 3 waffles for brunch. 45 minutes later and no waffles. Our waiter, Billy, didn't even bother to check on us during this time or give us an update as to where the food was. As he was nowhere to be found, I had to flag down the manager to ask her to cancel the order, and as I did, the waffles came. She was at least extremely apologetic and comped the waffles, but the wait was unacceptable for a simple order. Waffles themselves were good, but nothing special. And FYI, the restaurant is trying to improve their Yelp ratings via the check-in offer. Basically, if you check-in and write a positive review, you get a plate of cookies. Just something to be mindful of.  Overall a disappointing experience.",

We made a reservation and they were over 30 minutes late to seat us. The drinks in the bar were meh but Yelp check-in gets you a splash of prosecco. Now for the food part. We ordered the octopus appetizer which was the best part of the whole meal. Perfect--smokey, tender, sauce amazing. Three people in our party had the branzino for a main course. It was perfectly cooked not over or under done, which is not easy. Here's the bad part--zero seasoning, zero effort to make it delicious. The menu said it was served with \"citrus braised escarole & caperberry relish.\" Nope. Decorated with a tiny piece of escarole and a drop of relish. Maybe you could ask the chef to at least use some salt and pepper? This dish costs $39. If you are going to charge this for one piece of fish, it had better be amazing and it was just a giant disappointment. I had the lobster ravioli which actually very good but an appetizer portion. Now the service. The waiters wear these retro white tux jackets. When your dish is ready a parade of servers comes out following the white tux person and ceremoniously places your dishes down. Giada has the mechanics of the kitchen down as the food temperature and timing were perfect and it's a big place. But our female waiter, while efficient as heck, was robot-like and cold. With the exception of the hostess and cocktail waitress, I got the feeling no one cared if we were there or someplace else. We were not even offered a dessert menu.",

    "text": "I have decided part of my bucket list is to eat at as many Food Network Chef's restaurants, as possible.  My first was the D Bar Denver, where I live, owned by Food Network Celebrity Chef, Keegan Gerhard.  My second restaurant was Giada's, in Las Vegas.  I made our reservation on Open Table the day before and were able to book the time just 15 minutes outside of what we were looking for.  We arrived, were greeted by the hostesses, and immediately shown to our table.  Our waitress, Tina, showed up minutes later welcoming us to Giada's.  You could sense her dedication to her job, her love of Giada, and pride for sharing with us the menu, guiding us to what we would most enjoy eating for lunch.  Our table faced the strip, but also the mountains beyond the strip.  The windows were open, and you could faintly hear the bustling on the street below as people were laughing, talking, and walking by.  Giada's decor is warm, welcoming and if you take time to really look around, you will see thoughtful meaning in every aspect.  Her flower print chairs have what I refer to as, kitchen cupboard handles or pulls, on the backs~ perhaps making it easier to pull the chair out for someone.  Her slatted window blinds are ceiling to floor and are BIG, but really beautiful.  Her lamps have phrases cut in them, and her bar shares a glass cooler where beautiful olives, cheeses, wines and breads are on display.  Behind this bar is a burning wood fire oven and next to it is fresh pasta, hanging in rows in a glass case.  Our lunch of salads and lasagna were delicious.  Beautiful presentation, just the right flavors throughout each bite, nothing overpowering any of the other ingredients.  As we were enjoying each bite, I turned around, and there was Giada; standing on a bank of steps which enters part of the dining room.  People in the restaurant began to walk up, shake her hand, hug her, tell her how much they loved her, and of course have a photo with her.  She welcomed each person as though they were coming into her home and were friends.  I was so impressed to know she exudes the same warmth and love you feel sitting at home watching her show through the television!   Giada is real, down to earth, grounded, caring and grateful.  We were sitting close enough to overhear most of her conversations with people, and she just kept thanking them for choosing to dine in her restaurant and thanking them for their compliments.  She probably stood there for 35 minutes greeting people.  Wow~  I returned to eating my salad, and somehow, it tasted even better after watching her, meeting her and realizing how authentic Giada truly is.  While I still want to eat at more Food Network chef's restaurants, I'm somewhat leary that it will just never compare to my experience here.  I guess we will just have to see~  If you are ever in the Vegas area, you must come try this restaurant.  Even if Giada happens not to be there, you will feel her not only through her food, but in the manner in which you are treated by her staff, the humor in her pepper grinder, and the subtle thoughtfulness in her decor!  I personally can't wait to come back from breakfast and dinner sometime!  Grazie mille e tantissimi auguri per il tuo locale ed il tuo successo!!  Diane~ Denver, Colorado",

    "text": "Expect to wait past your reservation time.  Place was crazy busy arriving a little early for a 6:30 reserve on a Thursday night.  Checked in at the front desk and was seated right around 7pm.  Felt extremely lucky to find two seats in the bar area while we waited.   Tasting menu - antipasti was good.  Bread service selection to start was freaking awesome.  Three bite sized samples off the antipasti menu made for a nice variety and a light first course.  Pasta, then main plates were surprisingly big.  Could not finish the main, and boxed the dessert selection for later in the room.  The food was good, it was just big servings.  Are they catering to middle America that wants a big place of food for their dollar?  Perhaps we just did ourselves in enjoying the bread to start.    Summary - beautiful place, good food.  You won't get surprises here, you'll get Giada's classic dishes prepared to recipe.  She did a really good job of translating her brand into a restaurant.   Next time we'll stick with our instincts and get antipasti, salad and pasta, period.",

    "text": "A new low, even for Giada.  I was in Vegas last weekend with a friend who didn't want to miss eating there.  She made a reservation for a window table many weeks in advance.  The night before our planned dinner, she got a call from the restaurant asking if we planned to spend at least $100 per person because those are \"premium\" tables.  At this point, I would have told them to stick their table but she said yes. So we ate there.  Magnificent view, so-so overpriced food.  We wound up spending $90 per person.  I was afraid they would add $20 to the bill.  I DO NOT understand what this place is so popular.",

Sangria lacked in the wine department, very refreshing drink but not made well. Way too many people walking around not doing anything productive or even asking if we need anything or if we are ok. We wanted to order something and no one came to help us.  Food was ok, not full of flavor but if you are looking for something refreshing and light, this is a great stop.

    "text": "Husband and I were thinking about having a brunch so we opted for Giadas at Cromwell, which we have never been but love her cooking shows, etc. Perhaps the Dinner (which we haven't tried)  is better but I wouldn't eat Brunch here again because of service and quality of food. We arrived around 9:05 am, shortly after opening at 9 am. Took 10 minutes to get seated in a near empty restaurant as it had just opened and there was no crowd; there were only 2 other tables with couples at them. The Hostess just smiled dumbly, seeming a bit confused but polite enough. Finally was seated and we were approached a long time later by our waiter.  By this time, a few more tables and the bar was filling up. Mind you, it was early, we didn't see that he had any other tables to serve but a couple. I motioned the 'Senior Waiter' who was training another person and asked if we have someone take our order. His response was \"I've important things to do. I'll see if I can get you someone.\" Waiter finally came over, took our order, super slow....meanwhile the other tables are getting their water, coffee and juices and eventually food with their waiter. We are not. It took 20 minutes for us to get hot water. I ordered the flavorless Lobster Hash; it could've been the same at Denny's. Hardly any potatoes or lobster, just peppers and 'onion confit', which I saw no special 'confit'. Eggs were requested over easy, I got something harder. Toast (dry) came with my entree but no jam or butter came with it until I requested it. That finally came when I was nearly done with my hash. I was underwhelmed. Staff was slow and not super willing to be helpful or say they were sorry. Food was less than mediocre, somewhat cold and flavorless. It resembled warmed up leftovers. I wanted to like it but first impressions are everything.",

    "text": "I didn't know what to expect going to Giada.  I'm a fan of her show however there are mixed reviews about this restaurant.  I give Giada 3.5 but rounded up to 4  Preface: I came with a party of 9 and a baby  //Food// Amazing! Everything was pretty tasty.  We ordered an large appetizer to share.  I'm not exactly sure which one it was but it included what I believe was Giada's \"favorites\" like Crostini, bacon wrapped dates, wood roasted mushrooms, eggplant, olives, etc.  Favorites: 28 oz bone-in ribeye.  Holy moly was it huge.  The sunny side egg just made it even better.  My husband thought it was a bit salty and his was overdone which is why I took 1 star off.  He didn't send it back because service was SLOW...he was starving so he gave in and ate it the way it came. Pappardelle - it was perfect.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful.  I also had our server add a bunch of parmesan cheese on top.  It was amazing. I forgot what it was called but we had a hazelnut chocolate tart for dessert to share.  It just hit the spot.  Everyone had a couple bites and it satisfied our sweet tooth.    Risotto was good but I generally don't like risotto and my cousin liked her lobster ravioli which I didn't taste.  //Service// SLOW.  I loved our server Joseph.  He was great however food came out extremely slow.  I was also disappointed that they didn't offer any birthday desserts.  When you spend that much money, it's a shame you can't provide them with at least a cake and candle on the house.    //Highlights// There's a Photo Booth in the waiting area and you can have them emailed to you.  The printing option wasn't available when we went.",

    "text": "Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. This is going to be a long review so brace yourself, but this is probably one of the worst experience I've had with a restaurant for a long time...  It was a good start. The restaurant is nicely decorated with an open kitchen and a swanky set up with an option to be seated at couches, tables with great views of the strip and Bellagio's water fountain, and also a back room for a large party.   Well, and that was the good. Yea, sadly that's all it was for us. Let's begin with the downhill roll...starting with the service.  || SERVICE || Unfortunately we were not seated on any comfy couches, or in an area with a great view, instead we were seated at this 2-person table that seems like they just stuffed in the hallway because they had extra space.   1ST ADVICE: request a table with a nice view - along the window facing the Bellagio water fountain.  Our server came by and greeted us, gave us our menus, and was MIA for the next 15-20 minutes. No drinks, just bread on the table. When she finally remembered we existed, I asked her for recommendations and she just spilled out 10 items under 5 seconds with names that sometimes didn't describe the dish well. I responded with \"Ok... so I didn't catch any of that, would you mind repeating yourself and describing what the dish is or at least pointing it out on the menu?\"   This is my issue right off the bat. Let's be frank, these dishes are priced ridiculously high, so I'm under the impression that you, Giada, are setting your restaurant to be somewhat high class, no? So okay let's agree this is a high class restaurant. High class food should come with high class service, am i right? I definitely didn't receive the appropriate service you would typically associate with  this high-end dining.  Okay the order is in and still no water. I guess it's really hard to notice anyone sitting in this little hallway. Our server's assistant finally came by with a pitcher of water and poured it directly into my glass sitting on the table. Oh me oh my, you can go to a hole in the wall and they know to grab the glass, face away from the customer, and pour the water preventing it from splashing everywhere - I MEAN COME ON IT'S COMMON RESTAURANT KNOWLEDGE. Well of course the water spilled all over the table so she grabbed her white linen and attempted to clean it up. It obviously wasn't enough to clean up the mess so she left and came back with a dirty rag to wipe the rest. Ugh, this is such a classy restaurant.  || FOOD || Okay let's start off with the bread because that was pretty much the highlight of the evening. You think I'm kidding but the bread was pretty damn delicious. Assorted bread, bread sticks, etc with of course olive oil to soak and butter on the side. Not sure how to really describe it cause it's quite simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed going through all of it.   2ND ADVICE: Get full off the bread.  The food didn't take too long to come out, thankfully. We started with the meatballs and octopus.  The meatballs come in 4 and have the height of about a half dollar. I'm not quite sure why these are a popular item on the menu. There were quite bland and really not that remarkable. \"It's just .... meatballs..\" was my reaction.  The octopus is terrible. Just skip it. It was over-charred so basically I was just eating burnt flavorless rubber. I honestly can make it for you for $16 if that's what you want.  3RD ADVICE: Don't waste your money on the meatballs and octopus.  For the main entree we went with the popular Spaghetti and the Rigatoni. The Spaghetti was good but it's not like it saved the night or anything. It was dried out and needed more sauce. The Rigatoni was just bland. The Spaghetti came in a size of a fist with two large prawns, and the Rigatoni could maybe give you a couple more bites than the Spaghetti. Both were tiny dishes, so good luck to all the hungry men dining here. With all the disappointments I was happy to find something that left me pleased... VERY happy to say that the pasta was cooked to perfection!!  Really, all I could say was that this whole experience was BASIC. Expensive basic food with 'meh' service.",

I was very taken aback when the hostesses didn't treat me like a paying customer...they kind of brushed me off and didn't check up on me until 30 minutes later to ask my name again. Please respect all customers no matter if they may seem important or not! STRIKE 1!   If you have a friend that's a girl and you ask her to pull her hand into a fist...that will be the exact portion size of the lemon shrimp spaghetti. Savor every bite, cause those bites go fast! I didn't feel as if the price (~$35) justified the taste AT ALL. If it's going to be $35, it better rock my world. STRIKE 2!

Started off with excellent service, gave us all these menus from wine-list and an Ipad to pick your drinks, also information about the dishes.  It was overwhelming for me.  I didn't even know where to start.  So I took my phone out and started to Yelp reviews.  Lolz.  Thanks Yelpers...   The cocktail drinks were Flash Gordon, and The hannibal.  Good to start with some drinks to relax the night.  We ordered the Fritto Misto shrimp & Calamari with fennel & lemon aioli, Mortadella pizza Bianca for appetizer.  For the entrees was Spaghetti shrimp, lemon, and basil, and Whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  We skipped the salad part.  My recommendations, don't order the chicken.  Our chicken (white meat was dry and chewy).  The pasta is excellent!  For dessert we picked the Tiramisu trio.  Oh yums!!   No Giada tonight.. it's okay her name and logo was everywhere..lolz.. Overall service and food quality is top-notch.    Hint:  Remember before you check-in, go have some fun at the photo-booth (waiting area)  on your left.  Behind the black curtains.  A hidden picture taking booth and you can do your Selfies there!!   Enjoying dinner with the person you love, cherish, and birthday celebration = priceless.    Thank you Giada, a great night to remember!!",

The only thing I would say is if you don't plan to eat pasta, which is what she talks about a lot on her show, and I guess is 'known' for in a sense, there are other places you can get a better steak and fish entree.  I had the salmon which was great and my husband had the ribeye (it's HUGE); both were delish but had I known I wasn't going to order any pasta, I would've chosen an actual steakhouse to dine at.  I had just a bite of the steak and it was good, but not $80 good.  We were advised against the pasta as the portions were very small.   It's a great dining experience no doubt....there are just a lot of other places I'd rather go for a nice steak that isn't super pricey.    I would go back if a friend invited me out, but not by choice.",

Great job with the decor and overall ambiance! Our reservation was for 9:30am, but we arrived 30 minutes early ,and we were warmly greeted and seated right away. We were seated on a great table with view to the strip and all the restaurant.Our server Christopher was great, he answered some questions and explained some special items that were available for Valentine's weekend. We ordered the American breakfast that came with smashed potatoes and some sausage meatballs in marinara. Both my kids ordered the polenta waffles with pineapple and strawberries accompanied by Nutella and maple syrup. My picky daughter ate the whole thing , don't know where she put so much food ,but she was very happy with her waffles. I ordered the savory waffle with eggs and pancetta served with maple and bechamel. This was a really good waffle, I was surprised that it remained crispy even though I'm a slow eater , excellent! Same with the kids waffles, crispy and chewy. If that wasn't enough food we ordered the pastry assortment to share: savory muffin, orange sticky bun, croissant , hazelnut cake and my favorite the Rosemary strawberry scone, soooo good! The pastry assortment came with some raspberry preserves, mascarpone and almond butter, the tiny plate where  the mascarpone was served was chipped , an overlook I'm sure, I bet Giada would just throw the plate away, right? They also have some bar seating , where you can look at the nice pizza oven and a deli display with all their antipasto and pastry options, everything looked fresh and delicious!  At the end of our breakfast we had some fun with the kids taking pics in their photo booth, unfortunately their internet connection was done and we couldn't email or post directly to FB but we were able to print out our pics. Overall, I say if you are a fan of Giada , visiting the restaurant should be on your to do list when visiting Vegas. The prices are not cheap , they're comparable to other celebrity chef's restaurants on the strip so this was no surprise!",

The server we had was not friendly or helpful.  No recommendations given by him. We felt hurried as he had our plates removed as we were barely finished.  No smile, no \"how is everything\",  the normal that is expected from any restaurant.  The food was bland, served at  room temp and very small portions.  We had appetizers: the  Oysters Rockefeller, were the one item that was pretty good.  The octopus, mushrooms and pizza not so much.  All the entrees we're very bland and none served even close to warm much less hot.  The lack of much protein in the portions is noticable particularly for the price. Most everything was seasoned with lemon, but no garlic, pepper or salt. No grated or shaved cheese was offered for our entrees as in most Italian restaurants.  Won't return as very disappointed and we really hated that we didn't like it,  as we had wanted to come here for quite awhile.",

    "text": "I would give this a zero star if I could the experience was that bad!  My family and I took a weekend trip to Vegas and wanted to try a celebrity chef restaurant this go around and chose Giada's for our love of her show.  We've made several of her dishes at home and was eager to see what her restaurant was like.  To prepare, I made a reservation for 2:45 on saturday.  Little did I know the restaurant closed at 3 for their dinner prep when I booked the reservation or I would have made it earlier.   From the start the entire experience was off, we arrived a couple minutes before our reservation and the hostess greeted us and said she would have to check on our table.  While we were waiting, we stepped inside to see the seafood case and I noticed 2/3 of the restaurant was empty. Odd, as we were still waiting to be seated.  She came out and said it would be a couple minutes.  One of my party members asked if we were early and I said no and seemed puzzled.  During this time, two parties arrived in which the hostess said the dining room was at capacity and the bar was open.  About 5 minutes later she seated us.  When I booked the reservation I was not aware it was a brunch only menu, it would have been helpful to know as my family was not looking for brunch.  We sat down and was very disappointed by the brunch menu; there is zero options on there that all the yelp reviews rave about and the best the waitress had to offer was a burger!  This is an Italian restaurant, why would I order a burger!   That's not even the disappointing part, we sat and waited for about 7 minutes before we were seen by the waitress, took about 5 minutes or so to get drinks and then she came back to us and said if you aren't ready to order the kitchen is closed so you need to place your order now.  Are you serious! Why would you accept a 2:45 reservation if the restaurant closes at 3 and then rush us to place an order!  In an outrage we left and will never return again!   The worse service I've ever had at \"fine dining\".    Something our family was looking forward to left a sour note to us.",

Waited for an hour in lounge area while no one offered drinks or menus or anything, the hostess said the full menu was served in the lounge area. We were told we would have a table in 30 minutes and sat there for an hour while the hostess ran and sat people who came in way after us (other people without reservations) then made them get up from their table and moved back to the lounge area and then sat someone else. The hostess had no idea what was going on and there were plenty of empty tables. The vibe seemed chaotic and unorganized. There's plenty of places to eat on the strip with much better service.",

Once we got seated they brought us water and our waiter was with us immediately. Our waiter was very friendly and gave us his recommendations. The watermelon caprese salad (not photographed) was amazing. Very refreshing and the flavor combination was just so good. My fiance ordered the lemon spaghetti with shrimp, and I ordered the lobster and kale ravioli. Both filling and just delicious. They had a list of dessert choices that sounded amazing, we ended up going with the raspberry chocolate cheesecake. It was perfect and was just what we needed after our delicious meal. Service was great, prices were just right. Over all great experience. Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas. Thank you for the great service.",

The food -   Spaghetti - Were cold as if it been sitting there for a while. The spaghetti absorbed all the sauce which makes it chunky and dry. First taste was flavorless. It was sour and basically tasteless.   Braised Wagyu - No flavor as well, the meat doesn't have any significant taste to be labeled as \"Wagyu\" No depth of flavor for a dish that's been braised for a long time. Very disappointed   We couldn't even grab the servers attention to show them how chunky the spaghetti was. We barely finish the food because it was so bad.

    "text": "We had a reservation for 8pm and came about 15 minutes late due to traffic, so when we got there, we had to wait another 15 minutes before being seated. There was a photo booth (out of order at the time) in the waiting area that kept us entertained for a little while. Decor was beautiful, it matched the classic old-school feel of the Cromwell. The view from our table was beautiful, overlooking the Strip and Bellagio fountains. When we were seated, our server came out with waters right away and was super helpful in giving his recommendations for starters, drinks, and entrees. We placed our orders and were greeted with a beautiful bread plate with fun dips including lemon butter, pesto, dried capers, sea salt and red chili flakes.  Our table had ordered the seafood tower, which was incredible. Usually I'm a little suspect about huge jumbo shrimp, as it tends to lack in flavor, but the ones that came out at the top of the tower were super succulent and not disappointing at all. The oysters had an interesting topping of prosecco gelee, which detracted from the natural oyster taste. We also got the chicken marsala meatballs with broiled tomatoes, which were delicious. The fritto misto of calamari and squid was fried to perfection and the lemon mayo that came with it was the perfect amount of acidity to break up the richness of the fry. For our main courses, we got the margherita pizza (with sun-dried tomatoes and a perfect crust), along with the mushroom pizza. The lemon spaghetti was as good as I imagined it to be, and the risotto was one of the best I had ever tasted. We have been to Italy before, and the food that came out of this kitchen was very comparable to what we remember it to be!  Overall, this was an amazing experience and everyone at our table was very pleased with the food and service. We will definitely be back here the next time we're in Vegas!",

    "text": "As you've seen in other reviews, the customer 'service' leaves a lot to be desired.  Note: self parking at the Cromwell is $20. I didn't deduct a star for that, I just thought potential customers would like to know. Anyway...  I had a reservation for brunch for a party of 4 at 1030AM. For Vegas standards, that's pretty early, but my group woke up inordinately early, so I moved the reservation (via OpenTable) to 10AM. Two of us arrived at 10AM and the other two were en route. The hostess said \"we don't seat until the entire party is here\". Keep in mind, there were only three other tables occupied, so I'm not sure why they have that policy, but rules are rules and I'm not deducting stars for that.  Fair is fair and we were seated. When the server arrived (and I want to be accurate, so I'll say that he wasn't yelling, rude, etc) we asked about the brunch menu and I said \"which of these items don't contain dairy, because I don't have dairy. I'm interested in XYZ, is that dairy-free\". He replied by saying \"is 'no dairy a preference or medical reason?\".  I actually paused before I answered because I didn't know why I was being questioned when I asked about the ingredients. Imagine if you asked \"is it cold outside\" and someone replied \"why do you want to know\". Not cool (pun intended).  And in case any yelpers! want to know, its for religious reasons (I don't want to go into what the Bible says about eating meat and byproducts from which animals, so I won't belabor with you with that information here). However, as I have the freedom to practice religion as I chose in the US, I don't think I should be made to explain the reason the Bible guides to and away certain animals. I don't eat dairy, that's it. If the item has dairy, then I'll order something else. Very simple.  Anyway, let's get back to the experience: the server asks the question, I pause and say \"what difference does it make, if I don't have it, I don't have it\". He then replied that the \"chef would want to know\". I was about to say (but I didn't) \"you should suggest the chef download 'the bible' app on his or her iPhone\" but I didn't. I just politely replied that I don't want dairy and that's that.  I was very bothered by this entire exchange and I couldn't help but wonder: if people were wearing certain articles of clothing while dining and they say \"we don't want pork\" would the server then ask if its a \"preference\"? Is religion a preference? The religion itself or the choice to practice?  None of this should be brought up when ordering food; because its much more simple: the customer is buying and they are saying what ingredients are suitable for them. The merchant doesn't have to alter the ingredients, the customer can chose something that suits them.   The meal ended, we tipped 20% and left. I then emailed <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgiada.com&s=6a72b44a91f81072aaca4a960dd12770478bce8938ce3e4758e4fae74efe2153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">giada.com</a> but didn't get a reply (clearly they don't care about their customers at all), so I'm writing to let potential customers know what to expect.",

We ended up ordering the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, the shrimp tasted very fresh but the cocktail sauce fell a little short. For dinner me and my husband shared the cacio e Pepe bucatini and the risotto. The personal cheese wheel is the best thing about this whole experience, we love that we had the chance to take it home and we had a nice snack the next day. The overall experience was pleasant and the atmosphere was lively, unfortunately the last star fell off when we got the check, the server circled the gratuity 3 or 4 times (fair I guess, we tip anyways so it doesn't really matter) but when we got the check back after giving him our card, he hid our card behind the receipt and it looked like he circled the gratuity once again, it's in very poor taste for this type of restaurant, while everything is great, if I do come back, I would ask for a different server. Service was great other than that.",

    "text": "After trying Giada's on my previous trip, I knew I wanted to make this the special birthday dinner for this trip.  My long time friend and I were celebrating birthdays (a day apart) and I knew Giada's would make for a great celebration dinner and they didn't disappoint.  I made reservations via Open Table before I even began my trip and I'm glad I did.  Our birthdays fell on the weekend this year and it was fairly crowded on this Sunday night so the reservations assured we got prime seating during the busy dinner rush.  On the second floor of the Cromwell Hotel, Giada's overlooks the Las Vegas Strip with views of the Bellagio Fountains and Caesars Palace across the street, a purely Vegas setting with the lights, fountains and excitement just outside.  We were seated at the window and our service was impeccable throughout.   After Giada's bread selection, we started our dinner with the Mushroom Crostini and Tricolore Salad.  For the main courses, I had the Ravioli (lobster & crispy Brussel sprouts) and she had the Petit Filet.  Everything tasted fantastic and the Ravioli really was done well with the richness of the sauce.  Dessert was again wonderful.  We had the Citrus Ricotta Cheesecake and a Chocolate Souffle completed the dinner experience with a gastronomic exclamation point.   This was my only meal on the Strip this visit to Vegas.  I'm glad I made it Giada's.  The overall experience of the decor, service and wonderful food makes special occasions into special memories.",

If that's the case put up a sign stating that employees will serve it! Or have the cashier advise the guest that an employee will serve it! It's not that hard to do! What a way to treat guest!

I didn't even bother to read any of the reviews because I'm sure it had complaints like it's not all you can eat salad and soup like the \"Italian\" place like back home in Iowa, or I couldn't find s coupon for this place, this is great food, and I mean everything that I have had here over the last 3 years. I don't eat seafood but I do eat everything else, Some of my favorites are the Prosciutto fresh Burrata  with tomatoes Parmesan cheese with honeycomb fried chicken and every pasta dish and bread. You know food is good when you are cussing  at it as your eating it, or you just shake your head as your eating everything. So to the crew who takes care of me from behind the scenes like Michael S to the cooks, servers and hostess, thank you so very much for making each visit special",

They were all delicious - Tempest, Barberello & a strawberry basil one. All were flavorful, the strawberry was a favorite.   We were seated by the window (which was amazed by) and had views of the Bellagio water show and an awesome lightning storm in the distance. The place settings were gorgeous and I loved the ambience. It truly felt like Giada put her touch all over the restaurant.   Our waitress, Nancie, provided several suggestions and was very helpful. We went with the following:  Appetizers - bread plate (muffin was amazing as was the pesto) - bacon wrapped dates (everyone's favorite) - bruschetta  - meatballs  Main - lobster raviolis (my favorite) - spaghetti (delicious) - vegetarian rigatoni  - Bucatini with chicken (very flavorful and didn't need the added chicken)  Dessert - strawberry semifreddo - chocolate hazelnut macaron (my favorite) - tiramisu - smores gelato (2nd favorite)  The pastas are made from scratch daily and are cool ones perfectly. The display of each plate was gorgeous and was all Giada!   Everything truly was amazing! I would recommend this place and can't wait to go back.",

We did get a table by the window as requested and our waiter was amazing.   The food.  Sweet jesus, the food.  1* if even.  We were in a semi hurry to catch a show so we decided to do multiple apps and share an entree...   First up - bacon wrapped dates - or as I like to call them \"would anyone notice if I spit this shit out of the beautiful window seating?\"  HORRIBLE!! So bad the waiter (I wish I could remember his name cause he was truly great) noticed we each choked half a bite down and removed it from our bill.  Crises averted.   Shrimp cocktail - most basic bitch app ever ordered, no chance it could go wrong, right?  WRONG!  The prawns were HUGE!  Which I think they think is a good thing but when you have to (not because they're huge but because they're as tough as an overcooked toe) cut them with a steak knife and chew until your jaw is sore...no.  Just no.  And the cocktail sauce had the flavor of watered down ketchup.  Ugh.  Next!  I can't remember the menu title of this item but it was basically deep fried risotto balls with cheese and tomato.  In a nutshell it was a glorified Totinos pizza roll.  I just can't.    And finally the lobster ravioli.  Maybe the best thing?  We had one each.  And they were truly unremarkable.   I need serious redemption for taking my husband here on his birthday thinking it would be a perfect staycation dinner before a show.  Oh so wrong.  I have making up to do.  I'm not a picky person, I understand with new restaurant experiences it may be I just ordered the wrong thing.  But every EVERY single dish was less than mediocre bad.  Just bad.  Just no. No.  Don't go.  Ever. Don't.",

Don't get me started about that cockroach strolling across the bar) venues.  But I really enjoyed everything about my experience dining at Giada's.    When we arrived the concierge at the Bellagio had not successfully made our reservation and we were so disappointed.  The receptionist kindly seated us anyway, even though the restaurant was full.   The restaurant is lovely. We had a window table and it was fun to look out.   Our waiter was very sweet and helpful.  He took extra care to make sure our selections would be exactly what we were hoping for, even accommodating a weird food allergy.   The food was superb.  We started with cocktails and appetizers.  The mulled strawberry and basil drink was surprisingly lush and fresh.  Where do you get strawberries with that kind of flavor in November?  We had the dates, the artichokes and the calamari.  I would definitely recommend the artichokes.  The dates were too hot for me but everyone else loved them.  The calamari was nothing special.    For dinner, I had risotto and it was brimming  with fresh crab.  The scallops were a tad over but still good.  Two of us had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp and it was really delicious, the spaghetti, cooked and sauced perfectly.  The fourth person had the lobster ravioli for the final entree and loved it.  The table shared the Brussels sprouts and I heard they were really good, can't verify it since I wouldn't taste them.  We shared a chocolate dessert that was exquisite.    I will definitely return!   Maybe even on this same trip .",

Each bite was sumptuous & makes me hungry just thinking about it.  Since it was also my birthday, I was too full to order a proper dessert but they brought 2 delightful cookies, which I found room for - a chocolate that tasted like it had hints of PB&J and a refreshing lemon flavored cookie.

    "text": "Had made reservations a week prior to dining here. Our Anniversary Date Night.. Saturday Feb. 17 7:45 PM. We arrived on time & waited another 15 mins or so, as the hostesses were trying to get us a window seat. Hostess staff was great!   The waiters are very professional & dressed to the nines. Atmosphere is beautiful, elegant & classy.  Started with a complementary sampler type platter with several dipping sauces.   I ordered the Spaghetti (Spicy) which comes with shrimp. Two medium shrimp?! Presentation was beautiful however, it's about 4-6 oz of pasta nestled up with a shrimp on each side. Delicious yet a disappointment for the amount & cost $35. My husband had the Pasta Flight. 3 pastas Spaghetti, Bucatini & Rigatoni- outstanding, but again not enough meal for the cost. It's about 12 bites total. Yes, you'll leave not satisfied or full after eating here!   * Yelper Elite- you may get an offer when checking in here. Two glasses of Prosecco wine, that was a plus as well as the elegant Anniversary cookies they plated & granted to us at the end of our meal.  They offer a 5 course meal for $120 per person.   Sadly, you're paying for the name, location & ambience.   We can say we've experienced it, but won't return. BTW- our meal here was more expensive than our hotel stay for two nights! Crazy...",

The view is beautiful and we love the aroma this restaurant gives off.   Like always my wife got her Dolce Vita and I tried a Sangria for the first time here. Both amazing drinks and the Sangria you have have two different ways. I wanted mine sweet and it did not disappoint.  We love the American Breakfast so stuck with that. Life for us doesn't get any better when where in Vegas eating breakast at Giadas! It starts our day off on a positive note!  I always see people wondering Las Vegas looking for places to eat Breakfast. We always tell them about Giadas and their wonderful offerings and beautiful atmosphere.   See you again in a few months!",

    "text": "I love Giada, so finally getting to dine at her restaurant was so exciting!  Let's start with the complimentary \"bread,\" which is NOT your average bread & butter. They served a bread plate with fresh rosemary bread, bread sticks, and a crispy \"pita\" type bread, which came with condiments such as: butter, pesto, red pepper flakes, fried capers, and sea salt. It was so good! Great way to start off our dinner.  Appetizer: - Arancini. Completely forgot if they were crab or lobster, but I remember them being very good, especially with the red sauce.  Entrees: - Shrimp spaghetti: delicious and the shrimp were HUGE! Love the capers in it, too. - 28oz. Bone-In Tuscan Rib-eye: this was a show-stopper. Definitely a sight to see. This rib-eye was so big, it barely fit on our 2-person table. It was also topped with arugula and a fried egg, which made it that much better.  After dinner, we were given complimentary \"anniversary\" cookies for dessert! These cookies were the \"Giada's Favorite Cookies\" item on the menu, which consisted of: - A chocolate chip cookie: this was my FAVE! It came out warm, too. - 2 lemon ricotta cookies with lemon glaze: I'm not a big fan of lemony desserts, but these were VERY good. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed them. - 2 peanut butter cookies with blackberry jam: I preferably don't like peanut butter cookies, but the hubs does and he really liked these.  Our overall dining experience was great. Looking forward to trying the brunch menu next time.",

    "text": "I finally got here for brunch with some friends. I am a big lover of chicken and waffles. It is great seeing all the different ways it can be prepared.  This was probably the least desired and enjoyed. It comes with a Cacciatore Sauce and they put parmesan cheese on the waffles.  Chicken and waffles are supposed to be sweet and salty and delicious. The waffle was not edible because that cheese ( ??) ruins the flavors of the rest of the dish. The chicken was on the bone. It was a real failure of flavors.   The bloody mary was very delicious and we all agreed to that point. The pastries that we ordered too, meh. They did not wow at all. I am truly disappointed that I paid over 60 dollars for a meal that was halfway inedible and over priced. You can tell that no one was overly impressed because not one picture went out on our IG.  Id go somewhere else if I was you. Your palate will thank you.",

I made reservations well in advance and needed to wait about 45 minutes to be seated (table for 2 on a Monday night... yikes).  The place smelled like bacon and had an interesting mix of Hollywood meets the beach meets Italian countryside decor, and the food all looked great in the display up front.  The service once seated was good.  I liked our friendly waiter that joked with us, made recommendations, and wasn't too smothering.  The bread at the beginning of the meal was really good, especially with the fried capers and olive oil.  To start we tried the bacon wrapped dates with Gorgonzola cream and it was tasty/very rich!    My pasta entree was itsy bitsy for an extremely expensive price.  Lil stuffed pink tortellini shaped pasta with tiny diced butternut squash and brown butter sauce.  I think there were like 8 or 10 pieces?  Luckily the appetizer filled me up but I was expecting more of an Italian sized portion.  The taste of the dish was watery and fairly bland.  My guest got the spee-gay-tee entree and it also wasn't anything that she would recommend.  Big ol shrimp on top of a small cheesy pasta scoop. We both finished our meals, not enough for leftovers, and just sort of stared at each other.  The only thing above average about the meal was the price.  No big toothy grin from me!",

    "text": "Woot woot! Another one of the few places I would give a five star rating to. Decided to go here because I am a fan of Giada and what better way to show appreciation than to check out her first restaurant?! All I have to say is that the food, service, and experience was one of the best, and I'm not just saying that. Been to quite a few places so trust me on this one.  I went here with some friends to celebrate both a birthday and surviving a semester of medical school. We made our reservation about a month in advance and the earliest time we got was 9:45 p.m. Parking is pretty confusing to find and we ended up in the confusing and super shady Linq parking structure. We arrived late, but they were also running behind schedule so we didn't get seated until 10:30ish. Waiting usually bothers me, but there was a photo booth that you must check out. It kills time and is a great way to get a little FREE souvenir because you can print out photo strips!!!  The food was pretty awesome. I ended up ordering Giada's signature dish of lemon spaghetti which seems so plain, but it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. I was finally able to appreciate good pasta and experience what True al dente is like. You must give this place a shot at least once. The pasta had some firmness and chewiness that was just so novel to me. You get two huge pieces of shrimp which was so tasty and light since they were not drenched in sauce. The capers were a weird addition to the dish, but they kept things interesting with their strong taste. You also get free bread so check out my photos to see what that's like. I also ordered a molten chocolate lava cake which was way too sweet for me so I didn't finish it. The sauce they gave was pretty interesting because it had such a unique citrus taste to it.   The whole experience was just awesome and it was nice to have a terrace view of the strip while dining. Our server was really nice and helpful. He made us feel at home and made sure we knew what we were ordering and was honest about the portion sizes of the dishes. Definitely a big plus in my book. Most waiters would just try to make you order the most expensive items on the menu.  Again, check this place out if you ever get the chance. Just don't come here super hungry, unless you have serious cash to burn, then by all means go for it.",

We started with the meat/cheese tray--melt-in-your-mouth prosciutto is a great way to start the meal. We also had the charred octopus panzanella (which I had just watched Giada and Aunt Raffy make on tv last week!) and the bucatini for 2 served jn a pecorino wheel--outstanding! And we had a lovely view of the Bellagio fountain show! We always have a perfect meal at Giada and really appreciate all the detail she puts into her recipes to make them extra special. The service is first-rate, and we have made some wonderful memories dining with friends and family here.",

I started my morning with a wonderfully light and refreshing Prosecco Sangria and a small plate of assorted Pastries that included a Cinnamon Croissant Monkey Bread Muffin, Rosemary Scone and a Polenta Muffin. They were all good, but the Scone was my favorite!  My next course was the Breakfast Contadina with Two Poached Eggs, Crispy Polenta Cakes,  Sauteed Spinach, Roasted Tomatoes & Grilled Bread. Along with this came several butters and spreads like Chocolate Hazelnut and Strawberry. Everything was perfectly prepared and tasted amazing!   When I was ordering, I mentioned to the waiter that I was also intrigued by the Polenta Waffle. As I started to eat my breakfast, my server dropped off a small sample of that waffle. It was crisp on the outside with a soft, almost creamy interior. This will definitely be included on my next visit to Giada. I finished this visit with a well made Cafe Mocha.  Giada is a Beautiful Restaurant with superior food and wonderful service! I really couldn't ask for anything more. Giada is a rarity for me. A Las Vegas restaurant that I will return to on every trip!",

Although be warned its not meant to be a dinner portion more of a tapas size. But 34.00 is way too expensive in my opinion.   Family felt their meals were not fantastic. It's a bummer the food didn't meet expectation. The decor is amazing food is average. Combine with the poor service not worth the trip. Mostly hype.",

    "text": "Fellow Yelpers, you are correct. Definitely was not impressed with the meal or the service.   I love Giada's recipes and I have a couple of her cookbooks as well. So I was excited with the idea of going to her restaurant. I did read the yelp reviews and thought to myself that I may have a different experience than the other reviewers who did not rate so well...so I pushed forward with keeping the reservation.   When you first walk in, the place looks very impressive. Very open feel and a nice view of the strip. But that's where it stops. The waiter was less than attentive and frankly didn't care whether we were there or not. For the price of the meal we were paying, you expect a certain level of service.   Next, the food. I was less than impressed with the food.  I heard so many wonderful thing about their shrimp spaghetti. I asked the waiter and he agreed. So that is what I ordered. My hubby order the rack of lamb. When our food came, my spaghetti was luke warm, on the verge of getting cold. You can tell it has been sitting out (probably because the lamb was still cooking) because the sauce started to harden and the spaghetti kinda stuck together. Most fine dining places I go to keep the plate really warm that they actually caution you about the hot plate as they are bringing it out. I can tell the flavor is nice, but it just would have been that much better better if it wasn't cold :(  As for my hubby's lamb, I didn't care for it too much but he liked it.  I think the only thing that was good was the free bread and cracker that came before your meal.   On top of bad service and bad food, what was the most appalling thing for me was that the plates and bowls were chipped around the edges. I fully expect chipped dishes In a chinese restaurant but I never care because the food is good AND cheap. But at Giada's???!!!  Giada...if you are going to serve my food in a chipped plate and bowl, then you really should charge me chinese restaurant pricing. Sorry...but I sorta lost respect for you. In a city where there are sooooo many good restaurants to compete with, you just could not keep up with the big boys. I really wanted to like the food and restaurant, but have to agree with with all other Yelpers  that it was sub par. Go to any restaurants at Caesars or Bellagio, you will get better food and service.",

I misplaced the receipt, so I cannot give personal credit to our fantastic server. We started with the Gorgonzola Dolce with Raw Pear Honey that was served with a crispy lavash. A perfect starter!!! Our entrees were the Salmon Cake Benedict and the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese, which we paired with a rose from France followed by mimosas. The grilled cheese had freshness from the hint of lemon, tanginess from the heirloom tomatoes, cheesy goodness, and a perfect crunch on the bread. We finished with Lemon Ricotta cookies covered with a lemon icing. WE WILL BE BACK!",

The Orzco Meatballs... Soft meat and the sauce was super good. Great flavors.   Baked Pasta of the Day: Lasagna- this little portion of lasagna was good! It had mushrooms in it and the noodles tasted adente. Definitely worth the $24   Pasta Carbonara- very standard carbonara.   Pizza- the dough was so light and the cheese was so stringy. UGHHH I wanted to eat all of it. Soooooo good. Get the pizza.   Sliders- these were the highlight for me. The meat was tender. The red pepper jam was amazing. These fried zucchini fries were soooooo good!!! Ahhhhh I wanted to eat all the sliders!   Dessert- the lemon cookies and the peanut butter chocolate cookies. Ok. Seriously.... These stupid cookies are SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! Different than all the other cookies I've had. It's so good.   Great place to eat! Must eat.",

    "text": "I don't get the hype.  I came here for lunch - maybe dinner is better here?    I did not receive a good first impression upon arrival.  We had to wait a few minutes before we were seated.  I would have sat down in their waiting area at the top of the stairs by the hostess stand, but it was filthy!  And the restaurant had only been open for less than an hour!  So there I stood instead :p  When we were seated, we were given a table by their windows as requested, but the spacing there was ridiculously tight!!  I understand wanting to accommodate as many tables over in that area, but at the expense of comfort?  The chairs aren't the best for hanging purses on either, and there isn't much room to hang them on the chairs without hitting the person behind you anyway.  I saw women put their purses on the floor.  For a germaphobe like me, and as someone who likes to keep my bags as clean as can be, that's just a no-no.  As for the food, I wasn't impressed either.  I split a lobster roll which was too heavy on the lemon side for my taste.  I've had better from food trucks :p  I also split their carbonara pizza which was ok by me since it had bacon and I love bacon!  For dessert we had their zeppoles, which was nothing special and too \"citrus-y\" for my taste.    Would I come back?  Maybe, but not for lunch, which was not bad, just ok in my opinion.  I would have come for dinner but good luck getting a dinner reservation!    FYI if you are driving to the restaurant, the Cromwell only has valet parking.  We self-parked next door at the Flamingo which was quite a trek, and their parking structure is quite old and narrow!",

    "text": "10 Steps to a Nice Date on the Strip...  Step #1:  Make a reservation to Giada De Laurentiis' new restaurant, GIADA.  GIADA is new and reservations are a must.  My suggestion, request a table with a view.   Step #2:  Review the menu online.  You can also read the good, okay and bad reviews on Yelp.  GIADA's menu includes Italian dishes, with Giada's personal touches to them.  Menu consists of antipastas, soups, salads, pastas like Spah-geh-tee, ree-gah-TOH-neh, ree-ZOHT-oh, & Rah-VEEOH-lee, and main dishes like rib-eyes, salmon, chicken, rack of lamb, veal, and steak.  And let's not forget the sides...asparagus, potatoes, sweet corn, etc.  Step #3:  Arrive for your reservation.  GIADA is located in the Cromwell and their entrance is on Flamingo just east of Las Vegas Blvd.  I suggest valet at the Cromwell.  For those of you that wish to take a stroll through the Linq or walk off dinner, then park at the Linq.  Step #4:  Check in and wait in their lobby's comfortable seating.  The lobby also sports a photo booth where you can take instant pictures.  These pictures can be printed on the spot (we didn't print our since the printer was busted), uploaded on Twitter, and/or uploaded to The Facebook.  Step #5:  Your hostess will take you to your table.  You server will arrive shortly for your drink order and of course, drop off some carbs (i.e. breads and spreads) and some of their $8 water.   You smell that?  Yup, it's fresh Las Vegas Strip air.  The restaurant has retractable windows (opened when we dined) and a good view of the strip.  Step #6:  Check out the menu one last time and make your decision.  For me, it was the Orzo Meatballs and Risotto (crab & scallops).  My beautiful date had the Spaghetti and Lobster Arancini.    Step #7:  Enjoy the view.  That means phones down, no Yelping, no texting, and no Facebook.  My gf had a pretty good view of Caesar's and the Bellagio Fountains.  My view was the gf.  My thoughts....I had the best view.   Step #8:  Food arrives and it's time to eat.  Okay, bring the phones back out for some pictures if you do that kinda thing.  To be frank, our food pictures are really unnecessary since almost every food photo is already posted on Yelp.  Just remember, there's only one original fork pic.  As for our meal, I loved mine and my gf's.  Yes, we tend to sample each other's dishes because that's what Yelpers do.  Everything tasted good, presentation was as good as it gets, and the portions were just right (enough that kept your satisfied, not too much that your belly couldn't afford dessert).   Step #9:  Decide or have one of their Italian doughnuts, cookies, Tiramisu, gelato, or sorbets for dessert. We passed since we already had dessert lined up elsewhere  Step #10:  Repeat.  I look forward to trying their lunch next time.   PS:  I have to mention the overall service at Giada.  5 Stars for the service here.  Our hostess and servers were great.  The Manager made multiple stops at our table to check on us and on the way out, he went out of his way to thank us for dining here.  Kudos, Giada!  So far, I'm a fan.",

    "text": "First off let me say, we're locals. We came when the restaurant opened, for lunch, and it was abysmal. I had a \"panini\" that amounted to cat food on two slices of white bread. I digress. That was two years ago, a lifetime in restaurant terms, so we decided to try again on our anniversary. Big mistake. Our reservation was at 8:15, we were sat at 8:40, after watching people around us sat before us. Bad start. We sit down and get our menus, and we waited 20+ minutes until the server came back to take our wine order. Here's the thing, I saw that he was was working, but for the level of overpriced we are paying I expect someone to notice how long we're sitting without even getting water. WHERE'S MY WINE? I digress. Our poor waiter. We were already irritated and my level of judgy was already through the roof. He apologized for the wait, but when I explained that we'd already had a bad experience and this wasn't starting off promising, he wallflowered. Practically disappeared. I'm not mean or imposing, I try to explain wth levity, and my hope is that someone will say, I got you!! I'm proud of what we do here and this meal will rock your socks off! Yeah, no. That didn't happen. He proceeded to not make eye contact the rest of the meal. The food... the food was tasty. We had meatballs, bruschetta, and arancini, all yummy. We split the bucatini, which was overcooked and gummy, very disappointing. Lastly we ordered salmon and branzino. The branzino was good, but my salmon promised summer vegetables and I got corn with like 6 Lima beans.  Sigh. Suffice to say, we should have stuck to our regular Vegas haunts. In this city, I expect great service first, and great food second. If you can't deliver on one, you'd better deliver on the other. If you undeliver on both? Two strikes, you're out. Giada, I'm in the middle of watching Next Food Network Star, and I'm fully side eyeing you. I have no doubt you make hand over fist money, but it's at the cost of your reputation and food authority. Try harder.",

    "text": "Seeing as Giada is the creation of a television chef, I didn't necessarily have high hopes. I was pleasantly surprised. The ambiance is aided by a good spot on the Strip with spanning glass windows that give way to views of the Bellagio fountains and Caesars Palace. It feels more high-class than it is, but that's not to say the meal disappoints. I found myself wanting more of the Three Cheese Tortellini, as the braised beef broth and Genovese sauce was dynamite.  We were in Las Vegas for my birthday, and our very kind (and legit Italian!) server sneaky brought me birthday cookies, with fanciful presentation. He continuously thanked us for attending and making the restaurant part of my birthday.  The only complaint was the initial wait. We had reservations and for a Saturday night, they did not seem particularly busy. There were maybe five people waiting to be seated, so we went ahead and asked for a window seat. They said they would try to accommodate, and after about 25 minutes, we passed an open window seat to be seated not at a window. Oh well. Oh, and they offered this hokey, expensive three-course option for like $100 where you get a souvenir menu encased in a silver pamphlet that had a generic picture of Giada De Laurentiis in it that probably wouldn't have even been worth stealing.

We ordered a starter of meat and burrata (fantastic) off the regular menu and were thankful, the antipasti with the tasting menu was eh. Mrs loved the lemon crema spaghetti with shrimp, I had the rigatoni with Bolognese which was very tasty. Both had the steak to finish, YUM! Could have done without the sides that came with the third course. We aren't big dessert people but they bring the cart over and offer you 3 each - the lemon cookies are hands down the most fantastic! Kudos all!",

We were tucked away in a small room so missed out on the beauty of the restaurant. We ordered 7 dishes and the portion sizes we're ridiculously small and so overpriced. I completely understand that you are paying for atmosphere and location but it was ludicrous. My friend ordered a side of Polenta and it was a 2\" scoop, lol. We laughed about it and when the bill came we cried. The waiter was very unfriendly and didn't provide top service like you would expect at an upscale restaurant. If you decide to go get ready to empty your pockets, not happy.",

    "text": "Giada is my absolute favorite Food Network chef. She inspired me in so many ways to cook, eat healthier, etc. I have met her several times and she's been a pleasure to be with.  So when I heard that she was opening a restaurant, I couldn't pass it up. Let's fast forward to a year of wishing: I finally was able to pay a visit! And let me tell you...it was everything I imagined her restaurant to be.  Ambience: Very modern, elegant, yet welcoming. It feels as if you're walking into Giada's home. It's surrounded with pics of her family, furniture that she has at home, etc. I love how it has a woman's touch to the decor...  Food: Delicious! Exactly what I would expect from Giada. Portions are smaller but good enough to have a bite from lots of things from the menu. I encourage sharing as this will allow you to try all the items you want to order (it's difficult to choose just one! lol. My first experience at dinner was so good that I had to come back for lunch the next day...  What I Ordered (Dinner):  * Complimentary Bread Plate: I enjoyed the homemade rosemary focaccia! So flavorful dipped in the pesto sauce it comes with!  * Orzo Meatballs: The best meatballs I've ever had. Not exaggerating. Very tender and flavorful. My mom who is not a meatball person enjoyed it and stole my portion! I was so mad haha. Please get this...it's Jade's favorite (Giada's daughter). This was so good I ordered it again on my second visit!  * Grilled Octopus: Not chewy at all. Super tender. It had a nice char on the outside and paired well with the potato caper salsa it was served with. It's a favorite of Giada's.  * Fritto Misto: I've had better. The batter wasn't too crispy but loved the lemon aioli and fennel salad it came with.  * Oysters with Prosecco Mignonette: Sweet, fresh, & clean tasting from the mignonette sauce. Wish we had more!  * Sopressata: How could you go wrong with spicy salami?!  * Caprese Salad: The mini heirloom tomatoes were super sweet and the mozzarella was oozing with creaminess. Such a guilty pleasure.  * Romaine Salad (Giada's version of a Caesar Salad): I loved how Giada added crispy capers and bits of anchovies. Worked well with the grated parmesan and crispy romaine.  * Lobster Ravioli: I wasn't a fan. The tarragon butter sauce had a unique flavor I wasn't too fond of. The ravioli was al dente though which I was happy about.   * Crispy Branzino with Orange Vinaigrette: I was really surprised with this dish. Absolutely delicious! The fish was very crispy and the meat was moist. I wouldn't have expected it to work well with the arugula salad with orange vinaigrette but it was a match made in heaven! Bitter from the arugula and nice citrus pop from the vinaigrette. Highly recommended if you like fish!  * Lemon Spaghetti with Jumbo Shrimp: I fell in love with this dish. It's deceiving at first that it's on the smaller side bit it's very filling!!!! You get two jumbo prawns and they are huge! The sauce is very light and refreshing even if it is a creamy sauce. I love the clean flavor the lemon gives and the nice pop the fried capers provided. I can see why this is one of her signature dishes.  * Tuscan Ribeye with A Fried Egg: A meat lover's dream come True. 28 oz ribeye cooked to your liking with a fried egg on top...who wouldn't love that?! I love the oozing yoke paired with the juicy ribeye. The other table beside us couldn't take their eyes off this thing...it's definitely a sight to see.  * Giada's Signature Cookies: My favorite was the chocolate chip. Warm and chocolatey!   What I Ordered (Brunch):  * Carbonara Pizza w/ Fried Egg: Pancetta and an egg on a pizza? I'm sold. So good! Everything you'd ever want in a pizza...  * Margherita Pizza: Simplicity at it's best. The tomato sauce was very sweet and the traditional combo of basil, tomato, & mozzarella never fails. And on a side note...Giada's pizza dough is very good. Has a nice honey note to it and it's charred to perfection in her brick oven.  * Orzo Meatballs: It's that good that I had to order it again!  * Zucchini Scapece: I'm so glad I was able to get this as a side order. Strands of potato, zucchini, and onion are lightly fried and served piled high to your table. I couldn't stop snacking on this in between bites from my pizza!  * Arugula Salad with Candied Lemon Vinaigrette: As simple as the salad was....I really enjoyed the vinaigrette. Little bits of candied lemon bits floated around and provided a nice burst of citrus that contrasted with the peppery arugula and crispy pancetta.   * White Sangria: Bubbly, fruity, and crisp. Perfect for the hot weather!  Overall I had a great time at Giada's. Service was superb and the food was amazing. I'll admit it's very expensive but worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for. It definitely was the highlight of my trip to Vegas. I can't wait to go back.   PS: Make sure you stop by the photo booth for an opportunity to capture your visit!!!!",

    "text": "Classy, but relaxed atmosphere? Yep. Beautiful views? True. Delicious food? Without a doubt! Portions? Perfect for us. Expensive? Duh. Worth it? You bet - every last cent!   My man and I never go out to fancy dining restaurants. Heck, we rarely go out to eat, period (we're fantastic cooks, and I'm picky). But, we were back in good ole' Vegas for a wedding and decided to treat ourselves to brunch after we'd been dying to know what Giada's has to offer. Man, we were NOT disappointed in the least.   The first thing that caught our attention was the classy, elegant, yet very \"homey\" look and vibe of the joint. Giada did a really great job with creating that welcome sense of environment, yet still adding that special splash of classiness. We arrived early and had cocktails at the bar (hello our new fave whiskey drink, Serpico - and I'm not even a whiskey girl - and the delicious White Peach Bellini and Prosecco) while the friendly hostess prepared our table a half hour early for us. Every employee we encountered and talked to was super friendly and provided superb customer service. Now, down to the food....  We ordered the Tasting Board, which comes with different cheeses (OMG, the parmigiano reggiano! YUM!), olives, a honeycomb, some salumi (or prosciutto di parma), and a veggie mixture (can't remember the name). We also ordered the arugula salad (but swapped the crispy pancetta for the fried capers...again, YUM), the Caprese Egg White Fritata, and the Salumi Pizza. The portion sizes were absolutely perfect for us, and the food.....OUT OF BOUNDS! I seriously couldn't believe how good just an arugula salad can be. The pizza dough was by far one of the best tasting doughs I've ever had - light and airy, yet had that wood fired char throughout. The fresh mozzarella on both the pizza and my fritata was so, so, so DELICIOUS - there's nothing better than watching the gooey cheese pull away for miles! We topped off our meal with the cookie platter: PB&J, Chocolate Chunk (the ooey, gooey melted chocolate that resembled the perfectly melted gooey cheese), and the Lemon Ricotta, which, ok, let's get real....that Lemon Ricotta cookie is like crack (sorry, no other way to put it!).   We had such an amazing, memorable experience! If there was a con to this place (besides the damage it does to your wallet) would be the service was rather slow on a slow day. We honestly didn't mind, though, because I feel that is done on purpose to allow folks to talk and feel like they're in an intimate setting without feeling pressured by a wait staff that can sometimes have that used car salesman vibe. I highly recommend (just save up for 6 months before going)!",

The Orzo Meatballs were just ok, nothing special and the sauce was very simple.   I ordered the Branzino for the main course. The fish was cooked nicely but the salad was very light and not overly flavorful. It was fresh but just too simple to be paired with a light fish. The fennel puree was nice but I would have preferred some bolder flavor. My friends ordered the Salmon and Lobster Ravioli. Both looked great and they loved theirs, I drew the short straw! Overall, a very nice restaurant.",

While our waitress may have not been the greatest waitress, I am just judging the food because I don't care that she was forgetful because her recommendations were great.

    "text": "This restaurant was good, but there are better Italian restaurants to visit in Vegas. I recommend Giada for a cocktail and antipasti- the ricotta crostini is delicious!!! Portions are large and meant to be shared. Prosciutto di Parma is as buttery as it gets! Pasta was just ok. I had both the shrimp spaghetti and  lobster ravioli. The ravioli had anise in it, which really overpowered the dish.   Service started off slow, but by the middle of the meal was excellent! I think it just took a minute for the waiter to warm up to us :)  Also- just a side note to the restaurant- we ordered a bottle of Biale Black Chicken- and the woman (unsure if sommelier or not) that served the bottled mispronounced it. I am only bringing this up because it seemed as if her designated job was to serve the wine, and if so, she should be familiar with the vineyards/wineries pronunciation.    If given stars on the service and antipasti- would definitely be a 4. Unfortunately, I felt as if the pasta flavors were too bold and didn't blend well. Like I said- I highly recommend Giada's for a drink and antipasti. Great place to visit for a small bite before a night out :)",

    "text": "To start off we made reservations and were greeted nicely and escorted to the bar to wait, order drinks, or tapas while we waited for our reservation(we were early). The bartenders were nice, down to earth, knowledgeable of the menu and eager to suggest good wines or cocktails. Despite a busy bar, they were attentive and timely. We were escorted to our table and told happy birthday on our way. We were asked if the seating was okay which is always a plus. We had a view of he fountains at the Bellagio too. We sat in comfortable chairs at adequate height and width that I did not have to readjust I the entire night. The table is laid with monogrammed dishes and decor that are simple but yet you know where you're at...Giada's duh! The waitress, Nancy, was prompt and explained the drink menu, tasting menu and regular menu to us and explained how she would suggest ordering. Not only did Nancy greet us sweetly but she was able to manage up her assistant and their menu. I'm not the biggest spicy food fan and Nancy offered to have the chef tone the spice down so I could still enjoy an item. The assistant brought us bread to go with our wine that we got at the bar and explained the different toppings to us. Oh my the BREAD and the delicious toppings! To die for. We decided on the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. The bacon wrapped dates melted in our mouths, the crostini and goat cheese peppers were delicious. Oh my goodness, an amazing start! Lemon Spaghetti and the Bucatini were superb! Fresh pastas and light but powerful flavors. We both ordered the filet medium rare, him with lobster and I with shrimp. Holy Hell!! It came with sweet potato mash and some onions with lemon potatoes and polenta served family style. Wow, it was all perfect. For dessert we got to pick from the dessert tray and my plate said Happy Birthday in chocolate. Get the Napoli! Great! Never once did we feel rushed and we always had a full glass of sparkling water. Nancy was amazing and so is Giada's. Highly satisfied and will tell all my friends.",

    "text": "Sorry Gordon Ramsay, but Giada is easier on the eyes!  So you're walking the Vegas strip and you want to have lunch at one of the top restaurants. Well, there's a lot to choose from. That's what makes Vegas VEGAS.  Giada is one of those restaurants you want to eat at. Located on the strip at the Cromwell, Giada offers a unique dining experience for anyone!   If you like lobster, take advice from me and try the Lobster Roll. I've eaten the best lobster out of Boston, MA but Giada is a super close second, or maybe even a tie!  She takes a different spin on the traditional Lobster Roll, but you will not be disappointed by this buttery crustacean paradise.  Why only 3 stars...the management is not good! Ever had that experience where they could care less if you ate there or not...yep it was that kind of experience.",

    "text": "Dinner with the fam! First off, the decor was probably my favorite part! Very modern/contemporary, even right down to the hostess outfit.  The bar area has quiet an expansive loungey area that spills into the dining room. The actual dining area is intimate and a little bunched together. I just felt that the food was okay and not really worth the price paid. Maybe I hyped it up too much so that I expected a Robuchon-esq dinner. *shrugs* My family of 17 people ended up splitting the tab and it came out to something like $90/pp. This would be a dinner consisting of one entree, lots of antipasta to share, a couple bottles of wine. Quick-E tips: -The photo booth is right by the escalators. Right when you get off, turn left and you'll see a little door. I totally missed it! -It's dimly lit AKA - kind of dark. Sets the mood if you're out on a date I guess! -If you plan to order alcoholic bevy with dinner, expect to spend dough people!  -Antipasti portions are super small. More like teasers. One dish is suited for sharing with maybe a dinner party of 4. I personally enjoyed the complimentary bread plate with spreads the most.... -Pappardelle was the best bang for your buck IMO. Flavorful pork ragot! My husband ordered and I was so envious. -Fregolotto portion was very small and I also felt the sauce wasn't salted. Even with the starters and bread, I finished my main dish and still felt a tinge of hunger. This is coming from a pregnant person who would normally get full off a small portion! To those that don't know exactly what it is, the pasta kind of looks like large pearl like cous cous.  -If you're one of those Rib Eye fanatics, you might love or hate Giada's ribeye. It's a Tomohawk. A couple people ordered it and said that there was more fat than meat. I tasted a well done piece and thought it was nothing special. -Roasted Fennel side was really disappointing. I took a couple small bites and gave the rest to my husband. It did nothing for me taste wise because it felt very plain.  -Whole Roasted Chicken looked delicious, but I didn't steal a piece. DARN! Wanted to see how it stacked up to Thomas Keller's version.",

I would much rather have a few smaller portions and get to try more the menu any day.   We loved the small bread tray and like others wished it was bigger at the time, but in all honestly once our food came we were glad it did not fill us up. The bacon wrapped dates were packed with flavor, the lemon shrimp spaghetti had the best shrimp i have had in my life and as a steakhouse fan I was blown away by the tender filet I had. The polenta was creamy with slighlty spicy sausage that was like velvet.   My biggest tip is to save room for dessert. The chocolate chip cookies are the best cookies i have ever had in my life. I know you are thinking its a chocolate chip cookie, no big deal but this cookie is the best you will ever have.    I must tell you that sitting by the windows is worth the wait every time. We were very lucky to be dinning on a night with perfect weather with wide open windows. Our server, Greg, was one of the best waiters we have ever had. Excellent attentive and caring all at the same time.   We cant wait to come back...",

We pretty much went with his recommendations and had the best dinner experience-at-the-bar ever. Giada's ambiance is upscale and warm. I highly recommend this place for a romantic night out, girls dress-up dinner, or just to eat at the bar and have great conversations with Robert :)",

    "text": "I was kind of hesitant about coming here just because of some of the reviews that I have read.  But I just had to try out one of my favorite celebrity chefs.  I must say that our whole dining experience here was top notch.  We had a great server, I think her name was Amber, and was able to get a table at the window which had some awesome views of the strip and Belagio's water show.   Everything we ordered was delicious.  Started off with the Wagyu beef salamis which were so amazingly addicting.  The Charred octopus which was so tender that it almost didn't tasted like octopus.  I guess I like my octopus somewhat chewy and it just didn't have that same consitency which must have been the reason I wasn't too impressed.  But none the less still very tasty.  And lastly the Imported Burrata which was very tasty with the balsamic salt that it came with. For the mains we ordered the Veal chop milanese which was a generous portion of veal the was butterflied and deep fried with fontina cheese.  My favorite dish of the whole night was the crab and scallop risotto.  The risotto was perfectly cooked along with some of the best tasting scallops I have ever had.  Pros: Our server was the best.  She offered great suggestions, really nice, and came and checked up on us at the perfect times. They have a nice wine list, with good variety of Californian wines.   I really liked their bread.   Beautiful restaurant with great views.  If you can try to get a window seat. The food was great and liked everything that we ordered specially the crab and scalp risotto.  Cons: I did notice that some tables that looked like it might have been tight and hidden in the corners.    Overall: I highly recommend coming here.  Our experience was top notch and really enjoyed our time there. However, I can see how the restaurant may come across as \"pretentious\" to some and how some people might have had a totally different experience as ours.",

    "text": "My husband and I searched high and low for a 7:30 reservation at a place that wasn't a steakhouse in Las Vegas. It was surprisingly difficult. We needed that time because we had tickets to the 9:30 Ka show at MGM, a few hotels away.  This was supposed to be a big night for us. We brought our twin 3-year olds with us to Vegas, so there wasn't much opportunity to eat a nice meal (mostly cafe or buffet)  Anyways, we get there at 7:25 and the hostess tells us it is going to be about 10 minutes because a table hasn't yet cleared. No problem, we go the bar, get a drink. We get up after a while to check out the menu. Now it is 7:40.   At 7:50 we check with the hostess. Any minute now, she says. I tell her we have a show to make and are getting close to a problem. She seems to understand.....by 8:00 I am really concerned. I go back and she says the table will be ready in just a few minutes. I tell her that unless the people have left and the table is being turned I am not interested. She assured me that it was and we are finally seated.  But now we have to rush through dinner at a rapid pace to get to the show on time. So much for my nice dinner out. I ordered the crab toast (delicious), risotto balls (ok but not amazing) and fried Brussels sprouts. Why are fried Brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze so amazing? Every time I get them I love <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthem.My&s=53593b5e19b59e7379611bd3c76f14c62af32eebeb3db562b6f33a8a1badd3b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">them.My</a> husband got the filet and said it was VERY good. Our waiter even gave us cookies to go as a mea culpa for the wait time. I appreciated his rapid response.  All in all I was disappointed with the hostess issues which ended up making the rest of the evening hard to enjoy. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Wanted to go someplace nice for my birthday. I'd been to brunch here so figured, as an Italian place, it would be good. Unfortunately, it wasn't. First, I don't eat cream and literally every pasta except one has cream in it. Even the spaghetti bolognese. Usually, there are plenty of things I can eat on an Italian menu but not here. The server, who was very nice, recommended I get the boucatini without the ricotta cheese on it. So I did. It was a bad suggestion and I doubt he'd ever tried it without the cheese. Really bland. I told him it needed something and ordered a side of shrimp. It turned out that two shrimp were $14. The shrimp were good, but still, overall, really disappointing. My fiance got the scallop risotto which was good, but he agreed he'd had better. The bread they give you at the beginning was excellent though and we had the orzo meatballs for our appetizer which were also really good. For the price you pay, you're better off going to one of the many great steakhouses like BLT across the street or Mastro's a block down. Lastly, they did nothing for my birthday at all even though the hostess asked if it was my birthday when we checked in and we heard her tell the server it was. So that was a bummer. And then the next day I got a message from OpenTable (I'd made the reservation through them) that we had skipped out on the reservation. So I guess the hostesses (all four them???) forgot to check us in even though she had to have seen the reservation to know it was my birthday. Anyway, you don't have to spend a lot to get great food, but when we do spend a lot, we expect something much better than this. We will most certainly not be back. Too many other good restaurants on the strip to waste time and money at Giada again.",

Our dinner order was placed, but the kitchen somehow lost the order & we had to wait 30-40 minutes later to get our food. Thank goodness, we made dinner reservations early otherwise we would've been late for the Beatles Love show at the Mirage. Other patrons who came in after us all got their dinner before we did.   Also, we were celebrating my wife's birthday that night & we made reservations 1 month in advance & requested a window seat to over look the Bellagio water show. Only 1 day before our dinner date, the personnel at the restaurant called to confirm our reservations & said \"by the way\" in order to get a window seat, each of us would have to order at least $100.00 of food each!!! Such a ridiculous & crazy rule and to only tell us 1 day before our dinner event. If I knew ahead of time, I would have never made reservations or come to this restaurant! I would've had time to make other arrangements & book a different restaurant for my wife's birthday! But since we were already in Vegas & it's too late to book a nice restaurant for this special occasion, we had to come here.  The only good experience here was our waitress (Lauren). She gave impeccable service & explained every detail of the menu & made us feel very welcome. Also at the end, she gave my wife a complimentary birthday dessert consisting of 3 cookies. She gave excellent service!  Also, I like to point out that while you wait for your table in the front lobby, there's a photo booth machine that you can take pictures. But down side is there photo printer is broken!   Overall, disappointing experience at Giada's! Horrible rule of $100.00 to spend per person to sit at a window seat & NOT telling your patrons until the day before their dinner reservations. Losing the order ticket & making us wait 40 minutes for our dinner. Giada, you need to take notice of such poor practices at your restaurant & make changes. There are plenty of other fine dining establishments in Vegas that people can go spend their hard earned money on instead of here!!!",

    "text": "After the less than stellar service we received on our first visit to Giada's we decided to give it another shot, this time for dinner.  The restaurant is always so booked that we had to take an 8:45pm dinner reservation even though we booked weeks in advance.  Not a huge deal as it's Vegas and you're going to be up late every night anway.  We arrived a little early and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table.  Just enough time for me to go to the bar and order a red Sangria to sip on while we waited.  We got our table and were pleasantly surprised to see that they sat us at a booth near the center facing the windows so we had a good view of the Bellagio fountain.  I'm not sure if telling them this was an anniversary dinner had anything to do with it.  Much better than our view last time when we were put at the far right of the windows.  Our waiter was Cliff and he was MUCH better than the Miley Cyrus lookin' girl we had the last time.  We has friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered the Surf and Turf, (Filet Mignon with Lobster Ravioli and Cliff made a great recommendation on a glass of red wine to go with it. The wife was Spaghetti with Shrimp and the mother in law had Risotto with Scallops.  Everything was very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  However I was a little disappointed that the dish only came with ONE ravioli, (not a lot of food for the $56 price tag the dish carries).  I guess Giada doesn't want you getting too full.  For dessert we ordered the leaning tower of chocolate and Cliff also brought us some complimentary lemon cookies on a plate that said, \"Happy Anniversary\".  Nice touch.  My wife raved about the coffee the last time we were here so when Cliff came to take our dessert order I mentioned that my wife was looking forward to it.  Unfortunately Cliff thought I meant she just wanted a cup of regular coffee when what she wanted was the mocha that she had had on our last visit.  The wife tried the plain coffee but didn't really like it.  So I went over to Cliff and apologized for the misunderstanding.  I showed him a picture of the coffee drink she previously had as I had it on my phone.  Apparently they make a different mocha drink at night than they do in the evening and Cliff wasn't quite sure which one she had had.  But he brought her both an Orange Mocha and a kind of Amaretto Espresso.  The wife liked them both but ended up drinking the Espresso and giving the Mocha to her mom.  Overall the experience was amazing and Cliff did an excellent job of making the evening memorable.",

When we arrived, the restaurant had an amazing aroma of burning wood chips which made us feel at home and the ambience was just beautiful. The hostesses were so friendly and took us right to our table, which was a curved booth facing the window where we were able to see the Bellagio fountains! Perfect scenery for a romantic dinner! We were greeted by our waiter, Joe R., who was incredibly friendly and personable and did not skip a beat when explaining some of the more popular food items. He also suggested a red wine that ended up pairing perfect with our meal. Everything he suggested off of the menu, we ordered, and it was one of the BEST meals we've ever had! Here's a rundown of our meal....Baby Sweet Peppers, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Meat & Cheese plate, Spaghetti w/shrimp, lemon & basil (DELICIOUS), Lobster Ravioli, Salmon, Brussel Sprouts, and for dessert we had a Chocolate Chip Cookie, Lemon Cheesecake, and a Chocolate Truffle candy bar....O.M.G...Hats off to Joe for making us feel so special and for showing us his professional serving skills! (Did I mention that we were served a plate with 2 heart lemon cookies and \"Happy Valentine's Day\" written in chocolate?!) 5 stars all the way around! Thank you!",

    "text": "This was our second time in for dinner...8 months apart...and the menu was the same, not even a special for a Friday night.   I love Giada...watch her shows...made many of her recipes...but for an overall dining experience in Vegas, where there are so many to choose from, not really excited about recommending to others. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent with a nice wine list, and the chocolate tart is delicious (so light for being so decadent!)...so if you like her recipes, then you should go once. They were very accommodating by splitting a pasta entre for our app and cutting the tomahawk rib eye for us to share, so kudos there.   The problem is the vibe...its an extremely tiny space with a tiny bar...trying to be a CA restaurant with a CA attitude. It's loud with not enough staff for the amount of people they pack in...and the bar definitely needs more help. I don't mind waiting for my reservation (that you have to make a month in advance) if I can order a cocktail, but when the staff is rude because there's no place to stand to order a drink...and there's only one bartender to service the entire restaurant...then it's a problem. With that, I'm still willing to try them for brunch next trip and see if daytime is better. I want Giada's to succeed, but Vegas is a tough crowd to please.",

    "text": "I have been here 3 times now and I only have very positive things to say. Walking into the restaurant, you're not assaulted by over the top decor. It is very relaxed and easy on the eyes. If anything, the setting immediately draws your attention to food as there is a huge brick oven and chefs are preparing plates.  The menu they offer is small, but this is so time is dedicated to your food. I always get the Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese with wild sage honey as an appetizer. For my meal, I chose the Lasagna with eggplant and sausage. It was served with an arugula salad. I really felt like I was sitting at home eating comfort food when I dived into this dish. The flavors only complimented each other and not one thing was competing. Each time I eat here, I am amazed at how well the food is prepared and have not been disappointed with any of my choices.   If you're into non-alcoholic beverages, Dolce Vita is a fantastic drink served with a sprig of rosemary. Don't worry about the Rosemary overpowering the drink, in fact the scent only seems to add to the drink of fresh orange, peach puree, blood orange syrup, elderflower tonic, and club soda. I'm a fan of her signature cocktail \"G\": G Kappa Pisco, pineapple simple syrup, fresh lime, homemade apricot preserves, egg white & Angostura bitters.  But honestly, the lemon ricotta cookies are my favorite here. If I only ever wanted one dessert in my life, it would be those cookies. They come on an assorted cookie plate, but I always ask for just them and they accommodate my request.   Plan to spend time here because the experience is relaxed and unhurried. You are given time to appreciate your food, which I feel makes it a solid Italian experience.",

But I 'm not crazy about octopus so I ordered the Italian chicken, and oyster on the half shell and oysters Rockefeller. both oysters were wonderful. The chicken was just as good, while I was enjoying the food, we were treated by some of the best servers ever.  Bottom line superb dining.",

Place is upscale and beautifully decorated, mostly to my surprise by painting by Giada herself (I did not know she was multi-talented, which gives it an even more intimate touch),..Not your average Italian menu, mostly regional, and inspired by \"Californian influences\". I had the crispy baked chicken for two; I was not crazy about it, but everything else looked great and my friends loved their choices so I am not going to give it a 3 stars just based on what I had. You are served a nice small platter of different sauces and types of bread to start with. Service was pretty friendly considering how busy it was was. Not sure if I would go back seeing that I did not see much of what I like, but it is not for everybody and that;s what makes it special; the dishes are from different regions of Italy which makes it unique and a rich experience for food lovers...",

    "text": "Wow.  What a disappointing first date. 3.5 stars.  Ok, so I am a huge Giada fan.  I love, love, love her recipes on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFoodNetwork.com&s=6b69fa705d166b0d7acbaca42e76eaff10821f85e9a60250e5f766b68a57d519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FoodNetwork.com</a>, and I melt for her smile and personality.  Naturally, a group of friends plan a trip to Vegas for a 50th birthday and so we book a late Sunday lunch for 10 people at Giada, the restaurant.  This is going to be great!  We show up on time for lunch and taken past the very attractive cold display case of olives and other menu items, past the long open kitchen, and we are seated at a large round table in the middle of the dining room.  The space is open, with high ceilings, and huge windows that are canted open, allowing a lovely breeze through the room.  To me the decor was fairly unassuming, kind of like being at home in your living room - comfortable, laid-back.  After our initial seating the service became spotty.  Our server was ok, but basically left alone to tend to our table she was less than attentive, not meeting expectations considering the menu prices at Giada.  I had read all over Yelp and elsewhere about the Spaghetti with lemon sauce and shrimp.  Well, primed to try that dish we were told that it was Sunday at 1:30, and they were serving only brunch.  It was a different menu than normal, and the Pasta dish was not on the menu.  And no.  They can't go off menu.  Hmmm...  Plan \"B\".  So we got Brescaola ($13) and Proscutto ($18) and cheeses to start.  All decent.  Flatbreads, or pizzas, were just ok - the sausage ($16) version much tastier than the Margherita variety ($14).  Orzo meatballs ($15)are an interesting take on the traditional but while tasty, they didn't get \"wow\" reviews from the table.  Between the appetizer and main courses the server came by to clean up plates and silver.  Remember, we're at Giada, not Olive Garden.  The server takes our plates, removes the silverware and places the silver back on the table for the next course.  C'mon Giada.  The Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese was unique and tasty.  I added San Daniele prosciutto, and I think it was $24.  Tenderloin Sliders were ordered by several of my friends, and these were probably the best sandwiches on the menu, albeit pricey at $30.  The Lasagna ($24) was terrific.  Get it.  Several lemon souffles were ordered for the table, and they were delicious.  All in all, I expected so much more from Giada.  Service was meh.  The plates and bowls were oddly chipped.  We got one set of silverware for everything but dessert.  Food was 3 to 4.5 stars.    Sometimes first dates just don't work out.  Sometimes you have to try a second time.  Sometimes things get better in a relationship, even one with a restaurant.  I hope that's the case with Giada.  As a foodie who's in love with the celebrity I hope this doesn't have to end.  ;)",

    "text": "This pains me, but for the kind of money Giada's is charging, I feel it my civic duty to warn folks.  Preface:  My husband and I are huge fans of Giada.  We came from Southern California to Las Vegas to go to her restaurant opening week.  It was delicious, service was fantastic.  Second trip about nine months later, bad experience.  Chalked it up to a bad night.  Third -- and last -- trip was April 7, 2017.  We were meeting friends from Chicago and at our recommendation we ate at Giada's.  We ordered cocktails and were all cajoled into ordering the tasting menu, $120 per person.  HUGE MISTAKE.  The antipasti course was moderate tasting and very sparse for four people.  The Second course, we ordered the lemon crema spaghetti.  The spaghetti was stone cold, the two pieces of shrimp were tasteless and bad texture.  Third course Filet was tasty, chicken was tasty, the basil mashed potatoes were stone cold.  We complained, they sent us a fresh batch.  All four of us couldn't get over the green look and ultimately felt that basil and potatoes do not pair well as flavors.  Really regretted ordering the tasting menu.  There is no doubt the attention to detail, the incredible presentation and service that we experienced on our first visit no longer exists at Giada's.  I should note that after our complaint, the manager did comp our first set of drinks and added some extra dessert at no extra charge.  Our bill was over $500.  I expect, when paying that amount of money, that the food should be exceptional.  Our meal at Lucille's BBQ the night after far exceeded the meal we had at Giada's.  Save yourself the money and heartache and go somewhere else.  SO SORRY Giada, was really rooting for you.",

We arrived on time for our reservation & were asked to wait at the bar, which is fine, but on a Monday night when they weren't packed? Yeah. I don't know.  The bartender was okay, but rushed & short. I ordered the Giada cocktail ($15) which was good but a little sweet. My husband ordered a whiskey they were out of so he had to substitute.   We were finally seated about 15-20 minutes after our reservation time. It took a good 5 minutes before the waiter arrived at our table, another 3-4 minutes for water & then who knows how long it took for him to take our order.  We were given complimentary bread & accompaniments - which in my opinion was the best part of the meal.   Here's the low down:  Bacon wrapped dates - they were okay, but I have had better.  Artichoke arancini - Flavorless. The best part about the dish was the gravy they served with it.   White lasagna - NO. NO, I am not exactly sure what spice (possibly cloves) they put in this dish but it was soooooo overpowering it made my tongue and lips numb. ABSOLUTELY the worst bite of food I have ever had!   Sorry Giada, we won't be back. Service was slow and the food did not meet the standards.",

Tons of fresh vegetables and lobster chunks, thick slices of crusty Italian bread toast and house made fruit spreads.  Decor and atmosphere is luxe.  They just popped the windows open for some al fresco fun.  Love this place.",

    "text": "I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty \"Flash Gordon\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.    If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.    Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.    I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"Prosciutto San Daniele\" since we recently had Carnevino's \"Prosciutto di Parma Riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....  Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.  Although the \"Veal Chop Saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entree in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.    The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.",

I thought their service team all had adorable uniforms.   I ordered a little of everything to try but my favorite was the Tubetti (Carbonara) for its nice clean flavors (practically licked off the plate), Giada's Red wine sangria (yummy and great presentation) and the pasta of the day, lasagna.  Things that were okay were the orso meatballs and muffuletta sandwich. Meatballs just didn't have a wow factor and for the sandwich maybe a different bread would be my suggestion.   The overall look and feel is perfection. Elena and Eddie were a great team. The food came out slow but then again we did go on the Saturday after Christmas so it was packed. I would love to try more things so yes I will return!!",

Amazingly, our lunch wait was only about 15 minutes.  The location is wonderful, with views of the strip and high enough to people watch from above.  It is at the northeast corner across from Ceasars, with parking in the rear Flamingo Hotel parking.  As for the food, I believe we made a good choice coming for lunch, as the prices reflect the quality of the location.  However, we pulled all stops for her birthday, and enjoyed a selection of various lunch items and desserts.  The ambiance is that of her studio on television, with a clean beach look with wood flooring ceiling and white walls, and a deli counter up front.  The pasta was done just firm enough and pizza with just enough spice and cheese to make me want more.  Desserts were filling with an Italian flair and rich taste to go well with coffee.  Next time, we'll have dinner...",

Six women need more bread than that?! We ordered two bottles of wine that didn't come until our dinners were being served.  The wine was also not opened at our table?! They missed the mark on that. I ordered the spaghetti which our server told us was the most popular dish. Really? nothing to write about and it tasted like jar alfredo sauce, which I hate.

    "text": "Wow!!! What an incredible dining experience. We were here the other night, a group of nine. First, the restaurant is beautiful, very nice ambiance.  We were seated at a round table, which I LOVE for larger groups. So much easier to converse. So that was a great touch right off the bat. Secondly, the chairs!!! Upholstered, with curved backs, really soft and incredibly comfortable. I don't usually notice chairs in restaurants, but I DID notice here how comfortable they were. Great back support. So even after a 2 1/2 hour meal I wasn't stiff or uncomfortable.  Our waiter, Greg, was phenomenal. I want to give him a special shout-out. And the wait staff uniform - white suit coat with a white shirt and black tie - so classy looking. He was super informative, relaxed, friendly, not overly pushy. He's the only waiter that I've ever had who walked slowly around the table as he was describing the evening's specials so that it was easier for everone to hear. It was a small thing, but incredibly helpful. There are so many small touches in this restaurant that really make it special.  The menu was insane. SO many wonderful sounding dishes it was REALLY hard for all of us to choose. Another great touch by Greg - my friend ordered the salmon. He said that the chef prefers to cook it medium rare for the best flavor but that she should order it however she likes it. Another nice touch. A lot of fine dining restaurants make you feel guilty if you say you want your fish cooked through.  All of the salads, appetizers, entrees and desserts we ordered were fantastic. Wonderful flavors, perfectly cooked. The pacing of the dinner was perfect. Oh, the cocktails were amazing, too. And the sommelier was not stuffy, very helpful and, again, no judgment on not ordering a super expensive bottle.  All in all one of the top dining experiences I've ever had, and I've had many. Highly recommended!!!",

When they gave us a table it was one that had a large wall that blocked any view of the restaurant or windows.  I love Giada, but the restaurant looks like it may not be taken care of very well. The furniture is breaking and cracking. And the bus boys had their shirts hanging out of their pants. They ust didn't look professional. I bring this up because it's not expected and for the $$$$, they should have things more better kept.  Pizza is tasty and my husband said his halibut was the best he has ever had.",

    "text": "I easily made a reservation for Giada on OpenTable so that was convenient. It's easy to find as it's upstairs at the Cromwell Hotel.  You're greeted by friendly host and servers. The servers here are notably great and personable. Our server Nancy was great, very personable and she answered all of our questions thoroughly and made some recommendations for us.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the mushroom arancini to start with. Both were great. I love how the bacon was thick and crispy contrasted with the sweet and chewy dates.   For our main dish we had the branzino, bucatini with orzo meatballs and the crab and scallop risotto. All of which were very good. I was disappointed at the size of the main dishes as it seems like they are more of a tasting portion. So it would be best if you ordered a variety of dishes and shared family style. It works since you get to taste more than a few things. This of course will increase the price since you are partly paying for Giada's name.   All in all, I thought the food was good but with a celebrity name behind the food I don't know how it separates itself from any other fine dining Italian restaurant without a celebrity chef's name attached to it. I mean everything in the restaurant including the napkins, pepper grinder, serving carts all have the signature \"g\" on them lol.",

The best part about this restaurant was how amazing the service was. It was a large table so we ordered so many different items on the menu. From the veal to the parmesan filet to the lobster ravioli they all were pretty tasty. Oysters were fresh and came with a variety of toppings. The food overall was good but it's not on my top 5 places to dine at in Vegas but if looking for Italian food this is definitely a place to check out. Atmosphere was very relaxing with soft pop music playing in the background. Oh and the prices are not bad at all. For all the food we ordered with some drinks we guessed around $1000 but was about $500",

We were seated right by the window with a great view of the Strip. It was lovely.  We had a pastry basket to start, with delicious butters and spreads. Especially recommend the monkey bread! I had the strawberry polenta waffles, which were a bit too crispy and not soft enough, but they were still super tasty. My daughter loved her Margherita pizza, which is definitely one of the less expensive items. My wife had the salmon avocado toast and arugula salad. The toast was absolutely loaded with delicious smoked salmon, which we all shared. We ordered juices and coffees too, which are overpriced at $9 each.  Food is quite pricey here, but we got a Groupon ($80 for $130 worth of food) so we didn't mind. We even had enough left over to get two boxes of cookies. They have chocolate chip, lemon ricotta, and double chocolate. All great, especially chocolate chip.  We stopped by the photo booth on the way out. Very fun!",

    "text": "We celebrated my birthday with an amazing dinner at Giada.  I had requested a window table when I made the reservation, and was happy that one was available.  I had a nice view of Las Vegas Boulevard, with glimpses of the Bellagio water shows.  Rocco, our waiter, graciously explained the menu options, including the tasting menu, as well as the electronic drinks menu. Since I checked in on Yelp, I received a \"splash\" of Prosecco.  This now joins Asti Spumante as my sparkling wine of choice, since I don't care for the dryness of champagne. Hubby ordered an Amaretto Mule, and it came in the signature copper mug with a lime wedge.  Rosemary bread round and slices of olive bread were accompanied by small dishes of butter, pesto, sea salt, capers and red pepper flakes.  We went with the Tasting Menu and each dish was an adventure! Antipasti included caponata, sweet peppers stuffed with goat cheese, and bacon-wrapped dates with Gorgonzola crema. Hubby chose the Lemon Crema Spaghetti with shrimp, and I had the Rigatoni with vegetable Bolognese. Hubby's 3rd course was the Petit filet and mine was the Salmon. Our sides were the Crispy Brussel sprouts and the Lemon smashed potatoes, respectively. Lastly, the Dessert cart was wheeled  to our table, and we each got to pick 3 items! I selected the dark chocolate brownie with almonds (Amaretto?), the chocolate tart, and the tiramisu parfait. They were served on a plate with \"Happy Birthday\" inscribed. Hubby's choices were the peanut butter cookie, Napoleon, and the tiramisu parfait. My coffee was served in a huge cup.  Our delicious dinner was made even more pleasant by the nice staff: when I asked to take a photo of the entry, the 2 hostesses ducked down to give me an unobstructed picture of the Giada sign. This was a truly memorable birthday dinner!",

Also the focaccia bread that you start with is incredibly delicious and they give you options of things to dip the bread in like olive oil, capers, salt, etc that are equally as amazing. It's just so much better than a bowl of bread and butter and so much more creative. I was so impressed. Other appetizers we got included the citrus marinated olives, bacon wrapped dates, and peppers stuffed with cheese and honestly I can't pick a favorite out of those either. All equally as delicious as the next.   The ambiance is amazing, the decor is so creative and an awesome tribute to the De Laurentiis family with old movie posters etc. It was just such a unique authentic touch. The place is so warm and welcoming with an awesome view of the strip.   And if you can't decide on dessert, the cookies are ALWAYS a good option. It includes the famous  lemon ricotta cookies (which were perfection), a warm chewy chocolate cookie, and two peanut butter cookies with a little jelly on top! Honestly I am so ready to go back.",

There's a photo booth in the waiting lobby which helps pass the time. When we got in the restaurant we had GREAT seats right by the window so we got to see the Bellagio water show go off every couple minutes. It was beautiful!   We shared family style and had the spaghetti (lemon and shrimp), meatball appetizer, Cesar salad, risotto (scallop), ravioli (lobster) and for dessert the fruit tart, lemoncello souffle and tiramisu cheesecake.  I LOVED the risotto. That was everyone's favorite! The spaghetti was delicious too! Perfectly al dente pasta and 2 HUGE shrimp. The meatball was so soft and melted in my mouth! Everything so good but those 3 dishes were the highlights. The lemoncello souffle was a yummy foamy cloud. It was very soft and foamy textures not very cake-y. The tiramisu cheesecake was good and the tart was pretty good too but i think the cheesecake was the table favorite. I would come back here. It was a nice dining experience!",

We were quickly seated and our server (I can't remember her name :/ ) went over all the different food and drink options.   To start I ordered the Orzo Meatballs and Chicken Marsala Meatballs. The Orzo were absolutely delicious. So much flavor! I really loved the taste of the marinara sauce. My only suggestion (coming from a very big Italian family) would be to try and bind the meatballs together a little better. When I poked my fork in they did fall apart, but not really a problem because it was so good. The Marsala Meatballs were decent. My partner and everyone else really enjoyed them, but I guess it's just not my thing.   The next thing I enjoyed was the lemon chicken soup. They bring all the goodies on your plate to the table, and pour the broth in right in front of you. A nice little touch :)  For dinner I decided to try the Pasta flight. My 3 pastas were the rigatoni in a vegetarian sauce, the lemon spaghetti, and the pappardelle. Hands down the pappardelle was the best of the 3. Paired with the braised beef OMG absolutely delicious.   I am giving 5 stars because all 8 of us enjoyed everything brought to the table. The service was excellent. Water glasses were always kept above half the glass which was great because the food has A LOT of flavor.   If you get a chance definitely check this place out. Bring your money though. It ain't cheap!",

    "text": "Beautiful decor. Very impressed with the rose gold and white theme. The food was tasty and the service was on point. However, they fired our entrees too early and brought them out while we were still eating our appetizers. When the kitchen server brought the food, he realized the error, and took the food back to the \"pass\". But it was obvious that instead of refiring new dishes, they just stuck the food under heat lamps as my Berkshire Pork Tomahawk was a nice medium rare on the bottom and well done on the top. Also, the risotto had started to break. The prices are reasonable and it is a pretty nice restaurant. The service made up for the food issues. We will go back again...",

    "text": "My underwhelming Vegas food curse is finally over! Las Vegas is known as one of the food meccas in the U.S, but every time I visit Vegas, I usually leave broke and disappointed. My most recent trip started out the same, with a terrible and expensive dinner the night before, but at breakfast / lunch, Giada rescued me from food purgatory.   My friend and I both chose the lemon pesto grilled cheese, mine with the arugula salad on the side, and hers with the zucchini scapecce. The bread was perfectly crisp, the fillings plentiful, and the flavors were bold without being overwhelming. I enjoyed my arugula salad even though I'm not always a fan of arugula (it can be a little bitter without the proper dressing). My friend raved about the scapecce, which is like shoe-string fried zucchini. We both got The Palm juice drink, and that was refreshing and unique.   The ambiance was wonderful, with large picture windows that open over the main drag. The service was impeccable and pleasant. I'm not sure if this is the norm, but even the music was great - 80s and 90s, as opposed to stuffy, boring, and \"fancy\" music. I left feeling refreshed with a smile on my face.",

Veal chop and calamari were breaded and fried and tasted like you could get in most any diner.  The roasted asparagus was overly roasted-tasting with a funny after taste.  The whole chicken was presented then taken back to the kitchen to be cut up and the tomato/vegetable accompaniment put into a serving bowl.  That was probably the best tasting dish.  Lobster ravioli was good as was the Salumi appetizer - but for the price, none of this food met expectations.  Like another reviewer, the sparkling or still water options leave me feeling upsold.",

This was my last meal in Vegas before heading to the airport. I did not have a reservation so sat on one of the lounge couches. I waited for like 15 minutes and no one came to check on me, offer me a drink , or anything. I had to fetch myself a waiter, ask for water, bread, and a menu. The food here is really good though. I had the Orzo meatballs, Lemon Shrimp Spaghetti, and Choc Budino . The meatballs were just ok but a bit dry in my opinion.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the shrimp are two of the biggest prawns I had been served at an Italian Place. Very complex flavors although next time I would ask for a little more sauce on the side.  The choc budino had to be one of my favorite desserts in Vegas. It was so light and delicious with a small amount of the perfect finness and flavor profile. I love it and would come back here just for dessert despite the terrible service.  The atmosphere here is nice though and they make all the pasta by hand fresh. The vegetables are fresh.  They also have a photo booth to take pictures to commemorate your dining experience which is kind of unique.  Overall ,great food but terrible service.",

    "text": "After my long awaited reservation (I made 2 months ago!) I finally had the pleasure of dining at Giada's. From the staff to the decor to the food, everything was phenominal!  The restaurant itself was very warm and so well put together. There is a photo booth in the lobby. You can take photos and have them facebooked, emailed or printed right there for you.  Such a fun and cute idea!! The attention detail once you enter the dining room is obvious with beautiful booths, gorgeous tables and decor. We sat at a table next to the window, which is for sure the best seat on the joint! Our waiter was so extremely helpful and knowledgeable which is always such a nice touch!  Now onto the thing we all really want to know about: the food. It was sooooooo delish I want to go back now! We started with drinks. My husband ordered the barbarella, which was so wonderful you could forget it was alcohol! I ordered the savignon blanc which was so crisp and light.     -oysters rockefeller: amazing! They were fried I believe in a batter perhaps. It was so light though and melted in my mouth. -strawberry jam and feta crostini: the crostini was just the right crunchy and the toppings were amazing together. (Add the basil pesto to the top, you won't regret it!) -spaghetti with prawns: wonderful!!! The sauce is so amazing! Its light and lemony and the pasta is clearly freshly made and cooked to the perfect al dente. The prawns were enormous and cooked to perfection!  -lobster ravioli: stuffed full of lobster with a lemon sauce and chinks of lobster on the plate. It was delish! -side of peas: amazing! Peas with mint! One of my favorite things and it was so good!  Our dinner was one of the best I've had in a long time!! The servings are not what we in America consider normal (sadly) because everyone seems to want so much food on their plates. However, I think they were perfect and exactly the size a healthy serving should be. I actually ended up taking home some of my dinner.  DESSERT: NOM NOM NOM NOM There is this adorable dessert cart that comes to your table and you choose your dessert. We chose the lemon cookie, the chocolate peanut butter cookie, the white coffee gelato, and a chocolate tart with almond brittle. Everything was phenom but the chocolate tart with almond brittle was seriously orgasmic!!!!! I want to kiss Giada for creating it!! MUST TRY!! Our next favorite was her lemon cookie. Light and almost  creamy texture.  Ok so....bottom line: amazing experience and I cannot wait to go back!!!",

They have this adorable photo booth to take beauty shots as you wait for your table. The restaurant itself is gorgeous (like Giada herself). The drinks are outrageously awesome. I had the Hannibal- wow what a concept. It was amazing. You just have to try it to see what I mean. The food is spectacular as well. The assortment of bread you get is beyond amazing. Warm focaccia served in it's own pot. We had the Marsala meatballs that were to die for, margarita pizza (good but not amazing), the famous lemon pasta with shrimp (wow, look at the size of those shrimp), the tortellini (good but not I would get something else next time) and the vegetable bolognese. Usually I'm against vegetable bolognese but this sauce was deep with flavor. Then we had dessert and coffee. Coffee was one of the best cups I've ever had and I had the blueberry like tiramisu- very nice adaptation to the classic. Shout out to KEVIN for being an AMAZING waiter! Will be returning when I'm back in Vegas!",

    "text": "Honestly not sure how this place is holding up with 4 star reviews on yelp because our dining experience was totally disappointing. The place is real nicely designed so props for not screwing up one of the best views on the strip.  We had a party of 7 for my engagement celebration, checked in and got the grand tour before we were seated.  Decided it would be best to order a little bit of everything, from the chicken meatballs to prosciutto and something else that wasn't worth remembering. Chicken meatballs were pretty dry and flavorless. However the mushrooms they were stacked were pretty tasty.  The items on the drink menu were pretty good. For the main course I had the rack of lamb and my fiance went with the filet. Rack of lamb was dryer than the chicken meatballs were which tells me that they had no clue how to cook or prepare lamb. Now the sad part was that my girls filet was super dry, over cooked and basically not a good cut. Our friends went with with porterhouse which was decent, some others got the lemon spaghetti and another pasta dish.  Ended the dinner  with the strawberry shortcake type dessert that was bleh, cookies were pretty good with the espresso.  Now despite the crappy food the place is real nice and I don't really mind that it sucked because we can't judge til we try it right? Being Vegas I would probably not go back because honestly Italian food is pretty bland in my opinion and there's always new places to try in Vegas.  The only real bad part of the experience was that they ended up charging me and extra $260. After I called the next day and spoke to the general manager he informed me that they were having problems and that his financial dept will take care of it. Said I will have a call back the next day and that if I don't hear back to give them a call. I've followed up and still can't get this issue cleared up which is a little annoying.  Hopefully this review will motivate them to take a closer look at their dishes and also fix the error on my check! :)",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed with Giada. I was so excited for them to open, I checked their website almost obsessively. When I found out that reservations were available on OpenTable, I made a reservation right away for the first time slot available (11 am on June 4th, made the res in early May). I spent the next couple weeks obsessively looking for the menu and reading all of the news articles about this restaurant. In one article, I noticed it said that they would not be open for lunch for the first month... this was a red flag for me, so I called the number provided to confirm that we would be able to go at the specified time. I was assured over the phone that it was fine. Great. So we get to Vegas and I get a confirmation e mail from OpenTable for my res... I am so excited, but still a little wary, so I went to the Cromwell's front desk to ask about our reservation... they don't know anything and give me the number of the restaurant (which isn't the number on their website). I call... no answer. I call several more times and finally get an answer. I just wanted to triple check that my res is still good.... oh no, not open for lunch. 'You made your reservation when we THOUGHT we would be open for lunch, but then we decided we weren't going to be.' WHAT?!?! I had invested so much time and energy into going to this restaurant.... I drove to Vegas for this. I could not believe it. Not only that, but the manager, Nicole I think, was less than helpful. First, they offered us a 5 o clock res for that night, which I snatched with renewed excitement... only to get a call back a couple minutes later saying that actually they couldn't give us that res since they had a private party until 730. WHAT. Let down all over again. Who has a private event on their opening night? I thought this was the night for the public. At this point, the manager said she couldn't do anything for us, that we could 'try to come sit at the bar.' Are you kidding me? This was unbelievably ridiculous. She couldn't even just save us a place at the bar considering they were the ones who messed up? How hard do I need to work to give this place my business? I think the worst part was if I hadn't been researching, I would have shown up for our res and no one would have been there... how crushing is that? How many people did this happen to? I hope this place works on its customer service because right now it is garbage. That, and don't give out reservations you can't keep and never bother to call those people or contact those people to tell them that their reservation had been cancelled. After this experience, I don't know that I will visit Giada in the future and I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone else. I know it's a new restaurant and all, but get your act together.",

We arrived a bit early for our reservation, so I started out at the bar with wine. Great service at the bar and the Riesling was one of the best I've had. Once seated, our server was excellent at explaining the menu and answering questions. You get a platter of 3 types of bread. One is a parmesan flatbread, then there was grissini and focaccia, which is accompanied with basil pesto, capers, red pepper, and sea salt. The focaccia was great, but I wasn't a big fan of the parmesan flatbread. For a starter course, I had the bacon wrapped dates. These were great, and they came in a chili oil which gave them a nice kick and differentiated from the same dish at other places. For a main dish, I had pappardelle which had a pork ragout. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and then ragout was great as well. One execution error here: it took a long time to get a second glass of wine after finishing the first, but aside from this service was pretty good.",

I have to say their pizzas were good but once again small in size. Their bread is freshly made which makes a huge difference. Would I eat here again? Probably not.

I opted to get the breakfast fritatta and had a cup of coffee with it. The coffee was largely sized and our waiter was really good with refilling it. I was disappointed, not in the taste of the food, but in that it came with no sides. Others in my family that ate had their plates filled with sides, but mine didn't come with anything and was told that the garnishes (pea shoots and some tomato) were the sides. I ended up ordering a separate side of toast to go with it. The decor in the restaurant is nice and I love Giada's branding on the plates, menus and napkins. What was lacking was sides with my meal and with a friendlier wait staff.",

    "text": "Visited yesterday evening for Christmas dinner. My husband and I were somewhat skeptical based on mix reviews and previous experience at \"nicer\" restaurants. I will admit, I fangirled a bit at the fact that I was eating at Giada's restaurant so I see this experience through rose colored lenses. With that said, it started with the seating being a bit behind so we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table even with a reservation. Once escorted to our seat, it was a pleasant surprise to be seated at the window adjacent to the strip/Bellagio fountains! Unfortunately, we were also placed near the waiters booth and a terrible draft from the window. If you don't mind getting bumped by wait and staff as they ring up orders, then carry on.  Next, the food was good. It was as expected.. small portions, big prices for someone who generally dine at restaurants such as Cheesecake Factory and PF Changs. My husband and I love tasting a variety so we shared the meatballs, a salad, the spaghetti, and potatoes. The spaghetti is actually a lemon based Parmesan sauce atop shrimp, which I'm allergic to so we subbed for chicken. My husband took one bite and refrained for the remainder of the meal. I enjoyed it even though the lemon was so strong. It was pretty heavy so we didn't finish it.  Overall, it was decent but no hype.  Lastly, if you are okay with smelling like you walked away from a bonfire, this is the place to be! It was worse than the cigarette/cigar odor from casinos.   Go for yourself! It's okay but look at it like a gamble... you might win. Or it might suck. The chance is yours to take.",

    "text": "Last night I had the good fortune of dining at Giada's restaurant having made a reservation a month in advance through Open Table. During the reservation process, I requested since I was traveling for business and would be dining alone that I be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountain. Arriving early, I perused the waiting area and had fun at her signature selfie booth. Let me begin by saying  that the guest experience was over the top with kudos to Floor Manager Avi and the sever team of Nick and Brandon. Let's start with Avi - being in quality assurance in the food service industry, I observed how he walked the floor prior to the 5:30 seating thanking guests at the bar for choosing the restaurant for their dining and was very sincere with the dialogue that he had with each guest that he came in contact with. We spoke briefly at the bar where I ordered The G cocktail. The biggest surprise was after I was seated for dinner, Avi personally came over and recanted my request on Open Table for a view of the fountain. Well done Avi.   Nick, my server and his sidekick Brandon also displayed warmth and made me feel comfortable. Nick skillfully listened to what my taste buds were feeling and after much discussion, I ordered the Orzo meatballs which was composed of veal which I love, the candied lemon arugula salad and the signature lemon spaghetti all of which were spot on!  Food safety was also apparent as I observed a server reload individual cookies on a partial plate on the dessert cart which was being presented to me. The cookies were transferred by sliding them from plate to plate but in doing so this caused them to be arranged not as nicely rather than using tongs which she did not have. My point being - she could have easily used her bare hands to rearrange the cookies but she chose not to in order to avoid accidental cross contamination! Great job!  In closing, I failed to get the name of the female bar tender who waited on me but she was very professional and she gave no inkling of being upset that I decided to transfer my tab to my dinner bill.  Thank you Team Giada's for an outstanding dinng experience!",

Food on the other hand was not worth what we paid.  I ordered the salmon for me and glass of wine. After examined the menu, my husband discovered that the spaghetti dish he wanted to order, the sauce was made with Mushrooms.  He is extremely allergic to mushrooms, fish and will not eat red meat, so he ordered as his meal 4 side dishes and a glass of wine.  ALL OF THE SIDES WERE GREASY! Honestly, the best part of the whole meal was the Cauliflower soup and the 3 breads the waiter brought at the beginning of the meal.  At the end of the meal, I gave them a good rating and paid for the meal $150.80, but wished I hadn't by the time we both got home. We were both queasy and nauseous from the greasy sides. A suggestion: You should also offer an alternative that is just a plain spaghetti sauce with nothing added for your Rigatoni and other pasta dishes.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this place out.   I've been a huge Giada fan for years.  I own several of her cookbooks even!   I went to the desk when they opened and was told that the dining room was fully booked for the evening and that I could be seated at the bar.  I was alone so I figured that was perfect.   Only problem was that (what I'm assuming was) the head hostess stepped in and told me I couldn't enter because I was wearing opened toed shoes (designer sandals plus I had a fresh pedicure).   If I wanted to be seated I had to go back to my hotel and change shoes.   I did it, and came back (dragon lady was gone) and luckily there was a seat at the bar still available.     Food and service was amazing.   I had some wine and a couple of the starters as they're not yet serving from the menu at the bar.   I won't get into the food as it is discussed here but I was not disappointed.  Giada was there also checking on the tables.  What really made me stop was watching people get seated wearing flip flops, board shorts and tee shirts.  Yet I had to go back to the hotel to change shoes.   I guess Giada only wants the beautiful California crowd.  So, if you're in the 50ish bracket you better dress up or she won't let you in.   I was very disappointed in their screening of who they're trying to stop from getting in.",

There was a surprising amount of lobster in the dish and the cream sauce was delicious. The waiters usually say that their portions are on the smaller side, but after an entree and dessert I leave quite satisfied, and not too full.      For dessert I've tried the souffle, cookies and the black forrest cheesecake and they are all great but I'd recommend the cheesecake of the three",

    "text": "There was one thing I wanted from her menu and that's why we came here. Cacio e Pepe Bucatini served in a CHEESE WHEEL! but lucky for us, after we were seated and ordered it, it was SOLD OUT... The one dish I was looking forward to. I was sad... and with that sadness I ordered the following:   1) Orzo Meatballs $15 - Incredible does no justice to how amazing these were. Soft, juicy, delightful and delicate. Yes, meatballs can be delicate. The pomodoro sauce was out of this world. We took a shot and we hit the bulls eye with these meatballs. A MUST. (pst, way better than Hells Kitchen)   2) Capeletti $34 - butternut squash, 3 cheese, hazelnut gremolata. NO. When the waiter asked me how everything was, I just couldn't smile and let it go, this dish was very disappointing. Tasteless, unexciting, slightly sweet and just boring. Because of this, I asked if he could order us a Risotto $34. He said if it's because it wasn't enough food, I said it was because it was terrible.   3) Risotto (Crab & Scallops) $34 - Excellent! this makes up for the pasta incident(s). This was probably one of the best risottos i've had in a while. Full of flavor, so much crab in the risotto and the most perfectly cooked scallops anyone can achieve. Sweet, fresh, meaty and simply fantastic.   4) Italian Fried Chicken (cacciatore style) For one $30 - Yes, you heard that right. two pieces of fried chicken for 30. I was curious. And I found out why. The SAUCE! Wow. Slow simmering vegetable sauce with pancetta. I almost ended up eating it alone, with the chicken on the side. So much flavor in such little container. A MUST TRY.   5) Side of Lemon Potatoes (Smashed and fried) $11 - There were so good. The lemony crispy potateos with the melting fresh parmesan on top. A bit salty but so hard to stop eating.   6) Panna Cotta $13 - Okay. I usually do not like panna cottas because they tend to be boring and no texture. This panna cotta was not only gorgeous but it had so many different flavor dimensions and yes! textures. See the picture. I was surprised and yes, I would get this again and again. It was deceptively light you could have the whole dessert and not even know it went straight to your hips. Twas' that good!  I was initially disappointed at the sold out cacio e peppe and the 'other' pasta dish (Cappeletti). This entire dinner consisted of no pastas. And that was okay because everything else blew my mind and I would claim Giada as one of the restaurants that one should go and indulge in Vegas.  Service: great. They took out the Capeletti from the bill. I didn't ask for that but I am happy they did. Also the waiter was very nice and helpful. He deserves a shout out and I hope those who are great at their jobs get rewarded accordingly. His name was Radoslav V.   We also got greeted by the manager who took out the capeletti. They really care about our dinner experience and I think the personal touch made it better.  *They have a photo booth at the waiting area, send these to yourself via email* reservations are a must.",

    "text": "If you're in Vegas you have literally hundred of choices for where to dine- make one of them here! This will be a long review of a long, expensive, tasty meal, so buckle up.   We were in town for my friend's 24th birthday and made a reservation for 5 and they kindly obliged our request for a table with a good view. Located at the Cromwell hotel, the restaurant sits on a corner of the strip and is designed around that view. Our booth was positioned parallel to the street so that everyone could enjoy!  Girls at the hostess booth weren't very nice and gave us sideways looks when we walked in but our waiter was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu. We all got a complimentary glass of bubbly (thanks to the Yelp check-in deal ) and then ordered another bottle. Our glasses were topped off for us, which was great but also kind of upped the pressure for everyone to drink so we could all get more than just one glass!  Our good was OUTSTANDING. I had high expectations for a Giada restaurant and it did not disappoint! We ordered bread, oysters, two Caesar salads, meat and cheese board, then three of our girls got the lemon shrimp pasta, and my friend and I shared the Cacio e Pepe Bucatini, which was served in a small wheel of pecorino.   Bread was breathtaking and came with several accompany options: flaked sea salt, pepper flakes, capers, butter, and oil/vinegar, each in their own small dish. The oysters had a strange vinegar-y and chopped pickled-something(?). Not my favorite but I prefer mine only with a squeeze of lemon.  Salads had mild dressing, which is what I prefer, and I appreciate that the lettuce was in manageable pieces. Meats and cheeses were available at a per selection price so we were able to customize our board completely. Servings of each selection could definitely stand to be bigger- we paid $10-16 each and were disappointed with the portions.   Mains held to the standard set by the location, decor, and price of the restaurant. Portion sizes were appropriate for how filling the pastas were and they had great combinations of texture, flavor, and color.    The restaurant also offers an extensive wine list as well as Brunch, Dinner, Dessert, and Seasonal tasting menus; participation is required by the table. Next time I am in Vegas I will make this a must!",

I started with the Rise & Shine, which was a refreshing way to start the morning after a late night in Vegas.  Having fresh pressed juice as an option is so appreciated.  My wife ordered the Pastry Assortment, which exceeded my expectations.  Pastries aren't my favorite thing, but these were very moist and very flavorful, especially the lemon muffin.  I followed this with the Truffle Burrata, the Sopressatta, and the Buffalo Mozzarella.  The Buffalo Mozzarella was particularly good as it had been soaked in this chili oil that added a great contrast to the creaminess of the mozzarella.  The Burrata was also really satisfying, especially in terms of the ratio of cheese to bread.  We also ordered a caesar salad, which was delicious and very well balanced.  As my entree, I ordered the Salmon Benedict, which was really light and crispy.  The hollandaise was especially good as the citrus made it light while also being satsifying.  Hollandaise is often too rich, but this was really light and really complimented the salmon.  For dessert, we ordered this cake with espresso gelato between the layers.  They infuse the gelato mixture with whole espresso beans overnight.  It was really excellent.  I also recommend the limoncello souffle.  We did not indulge in the brownie cart, but it looked ridiculously good.  A huge cart of brownies, toppings, and ice cream is available for dessert if you have room after brunch.  Next time.",

Whenever I am in Las Vegas, I do what I can to get over to the Cromwell for some Lemon Ricotta Cookies.   If you can, try Giada's tasting menu. This is a great way to try a variety of menu items. I did this on my first visit and was able to pass plates around the table and try a little of everything.   The wine menu is excellent. The in-house sommelier has great pairings for each dish.   Memorable items: Lobster ravioli, Spaghetti, and lemon ricotta cookies",

I had a lovely brunch with sun glistening on my face as I stared out the window to a lovely strip while eat some amazing food. I didn't wait too long for my food either which is another plus. There's a photo booth as you enter to her restaurant in front of the hostess stand which allows you to take as many photos as you want while you're waiting for your table. I ordered a spicy sausage pizzete as my appetizer since it's fairly small. The dough pulled apart so well. The sausage tasted like something foreign. Just different and so well seasoned. I ordered the Cavatelli pasta as my entree and that was nothing short of delicious.",

Our entrees were okay.  My steak was closer to rare than the requested medium.  The side of potato gnocchi wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  We've had better gnocchi.  Wife's pasta was simple and good, not great.    Thoroughly enjoyed the desserts.  I ordered the peach souffle, and my wife ordered the baileys gelato with espresso.

    "text": "We went back to Giada again over a quick getaway to Vegas and were so disappointed in the service.  The food was a 4 like last time but service was a 1 or 2.    We arrived to a near empty restaurant at 1:30 on Saturday and were seated by the window.  We were given menus by our male waiter and proceeded to sit there for 15 minutes when a female waiter came and gave us water, apologized for our waiter and took our drink orders.    Our waiter eventually showed up and said sorry for being tied up with two large parties.  He took our food order and it arrived in a timely manner.    The food was delicious.  Pizza Carbonara and Cavatelli topped with chicken Milanese.  My husband had an Italian beer he's never tried before and my cocktail (G) was unavailable due to running out of egg whites.    So we're done with lunch and watch the table next to us sit there and going through the same motions we did.  Sat, waited, grew more and more impatient and finally received the check 20 minutes later than we should've.   2 hours later, we walked out.  I don't mind kicking back and taking time for a relaxing lunch but there's a difference between relaxing and waiting on a slow server.    It's unfortunate because the first 2-3 minutes of a patron's impression and experience are crucial for how the meal is going to be received.  Please train your servers to be more aware of their tables.",

Giada clearly put her all into this place from the decor which feels homely and yet lovely, to the food and wine options this is definitely an experience to enjoy. Great for all occasions and group sizes. They also have a section that can open the windows to make it feel like you're overlooking the strip outside while dining. The waiting area also has a photo booth which was a fun touch! Give yourself at least 90 minutes to enjoy your time here.   They have options for a price fixe meal as well if you're unsure or have a large group to coordinate. Nice bottles of wine could be found in the $60-100 range which is impressive for Vegas!  I strongly recommend the chicken.",

After getting some bread, which was good, we shared two appetizers. The Buffalo Mozzarella Ciliegine and the Prosciutto di Parma. The prosciutto was great, didn't really like the combination of the buffalo mozzarella with the chili. It masked the natural taste of the cheese too much. As entrees we chose the Fettucini (with lobster), the risotto with scallops and crab, the Italian fried chicken and the Spaghetti with Shrimp, Mascarpone, lemon and basil. I really liked the fettuccini, the sauce was very creamy and the lobster was great, too. The risotto portion could have been a little more generous, but it tasted great. The spaghetti were very tasty, good combination of all flavors. The Italian fried chicken was good as well, but one of the two pieces was too dry. We shared the chocolate hazelnut crunch which is like a very fancy snickers bar with a little bit of ice cream. Our waiter was nice and recommended a great bottle of Pinot Grigio. Overall, great restaurant, prices are not too crazy, could just improve a little bit on small details.",

    "text": "A different take on classic spaghetti and it was uniquely tasty. Looking over the menu, there were many dishes to choose from. It looked to have a lot of vegetarian selections. I am not a vegetarian, but it was nice to see that in a well-known named restaurant on the Vegas Strip.  FOOD I ended up selecting the spaghetti because for being my first time trying Giada's restaurant, I wanted to know what the most generic named item tasted like compared to other Italian restaurants. It didn't say that it had marinara, but described to have shrimp, mascarpone cheese, lemon & basil. None of the pasta entrees seemed to have marinara in it. Not sure if that's an Italian thing and marinara is not a thing over there or maybe not in Giada's pasta vocabulary.  DID I LIKE THE SPAGHETTI? For me, I felt it was dry with very little sauce. However, it did make taking the spaghetti with my fork fun as it would unravel from the swirl pile it was in. The shrimp were large and fresh in taste. Wish it had a little more sauce, but you know what? It was different from any other generic spaghetti dish I've ever had. The lemon and basil were there, the pasta you could tell was freshly made. It was good for $34. I would probably not order it again though as I like something not dry.  BRUSCHETTA My table ordered this for an appetizer. Came with 4. It was good. It tasted like any other bruschetta. It was crunchy.  DRINKS The server put a tablet on our table that had cocktails that we could order from the tablet. It described what was in each and how it looked like. We ended up ordering Frose which I didn't see on the tablet menu, but saw it from our table in a machine at the bar. THAT WAS THE BEST Frose I've had in Vegas. Smooth and perfectly strong for $17. I would order that again for sure!  SERVICE The service was good. I enjoyed seeing the dessert cart roll by but didn't order from it as we had to run to a show and were full.",

    "text": "After eating dinner here last night I totally get all the mixed reviews. When we arrived at 5:30 the restaurant was almost empty yet we were still seated way in the back with no view. There were plenty of open tables with nice views. I immediately noticed the loud nightclub music which was a huge distraction from our dinner. Maybe Im getting old but I did not enjoy it at all.   Our waiter came over and was just going about his routine. He didn't seem too interested in providing suggestions or answering our questions. We started with the bacon wrapped dates and chose to share the 28 oz bone-in ribeye and the cheese tortellini.   The bacon wrapped dates were good but the bacon was cooked inconsistently. Some parts were crispy and some of the fat was undercooked that we had to cut away. After we finished our dates they sat another couple at a table right next to us. Keep in mind the restaurant was still pretty empty, including all the tables around us and they remained open until we left. I just didn't get it. Why? It was uncomfortable.   The steak and tortellini came out a short while later. The ribeye was cooked medium rare as ordered and had a great flavor. It was super fatty, even for a ribeye..I would guess around 50% fat. The cheese tortellini were okay but the sauce was really thin and needed to be thicker. It had a great flavor but was almost the consistency of water. At $32 for six tortellini I thought it was way overpriced.   We ended with the salted caramel panna cotta. I did not care for this dessert at all and I love desserts! The tart berries did not pair well with the salted caramel at all.   Overall a disappointing experience. We saw many people coming in wearing shorts, t-shirts and hats yet we were the ones who were sat way in the back of the restaurant. Service was average at best and the food was not what I would expect from a restaurant priced like this.",

Super good taste in decor, wide open concept to awesome outside view, open kitchen, cute cute white lacy dress hostess wears, great bar lounging area. If your into decor, designs, Just by being there feels good, really.  I ordered Lemmon grilled cheese w prosciutto and sweet ricotta pizza(so Giada!). Very generous amount of good prosciutto, super light and crunchy good bread, good cheese, simply perfect. Can't get too much better.  Sweet ricotta pizza, sounds good, right? Tastes great too! Dough is so fluffy crunchiness to perfection. Ricotta's little sweetness n balsamic reductions tanginess with arugula's earthiness are simply awesome. Good size, too. I also got non alcoholic elixirs. Both great taste, not too sweet!!   Don't know why it's not rated higher, but as foodie and interior design lover as I am, I will give 5. Great date spot or great bite n drinks. You won't go wrong! I will def come back!! Love Giada!!",

We ordered the parmesano reggiano with honey infused with sage. For dessert we had the leaning tower of espresso. It was so amazing. Our waiter told us to give it a moment before eating the dessert and I know now why. But the best most awesome part of our experience was the small loaf of bread you get to start. It's in a small personal Dutch oven type of dish. It was sooooo good. It comes with 2 breadsticks and two cheese crisps. There is pesto olive oil to spread on the bread or the lemon marscapone. Omg now that is good stuff. Overall this place was top dog. I would love to have a full experience next time I'm in town. Well done Giada well done.  And guess what? Shake shack is not as good as in and out.",

She would be mad and embarrassed at the service, food presentation and food itself.    We were greeted with a smile and immediately seated.  Was not crowded at all.  Maybe 8 tables had people seated. Now, that is the only good thing I could say.   We waited and waited for our waiter.  He finally came over after about 15 minutes.  He explained the menu and started to walk away.  We asked him if we could order our drinks (3 coffees and a water).  Took about 20 minutes before he came back with our drinks.  We finally ordered and waited a long time to get our food.  During this time we noticed other people waiting and one lady actually stood up at her table to signal someone to take their order.  Our food finally arrived about 1/2 hour later and was just OK...nothing to write home about.  I actually asked the gentleman that delivered the food for some salt and pepper and he said no problem.  He never came back.  So you know our group almost got up and left because the service was so bad.  Sorry to say that we will not be back and would not recommend this restaurant.  Sorry but this place needs help.  I don't believe they will see many return customers which will torpedo this place.",

Instead I was given multiple numbers to call which were corporate people that referred me back to the restaurant.  The number that was suppose to be the hostess station at Giada's would ring 2 times and then go back to a corporate reservation line.  This happened no matter what day or time I called.    My fiancee and I went in for a pre dinner cocktail and app.  We ordered bacon wrapped figs, 1 glass of wine and some kind of cocktail drink.  The bill was 47 dollars.  I left a 5 dollar tip since it was just 1 round.  When I checked the bill on my credit card statement , the total was 97 something. The bartender had given himself a 51 dollar tip.  Now I'm not a math wiz but it sounds like he added a 1 after my 5 on the tip line.    For being a newer, high profile, celebrity restaurant, the customer service is a complete joke. I feel embarrassed for Giada and hope she takes a little more, 'hands on' approach to prevent any further criminal activity in her restaurant. Also, how about  making  some kind of management available to customers so they can deal with these types of issues over the phone rather than on social media.?  I did, dispute the charge with my credit card and they also quickly realized this was a scam and refunded me my money.",

    "text": "Upon arrival having a reservation for a party of 4 there was major confusion between the 3 hostesses manning the desk. After 15 minutes we were finally seated. Two of us went to the restroom when we returned we were told the waiter dropped off several items without explanation and left. They included menus, wine selection, an iPad menu and an envelope that consisted of a tasting menu. After 15 minutes the waiter came over . We asked him if we can have some water and he had explained that his bus person was a bit off. Then he proceeded to Inform us the size of the pasta dishes were only 5 ounces and that he recommends us ordering an entree and just sharing some of the pasta is in the middle of the table. Then he walked away. When he came back we ordered our food and he left I then went to the restroom and my husband texted me and said the waiter put down my food in front of where I was sitting even though I wasn't there. This was probably the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant!  However, we did notice the waiter behind us was more attentive and gave the people a much nicer experience that you would expect at a restaurant like Giadas. I would be reminded if I did not say that The food at Giadas  is very very good but the service and the ambience of the room lacks the quality of service expected at such an establishment. I've heard this from other people and would never ever go back to Giadas Nor would  I recommend it as the prices are quite high but you do get quality food! The service is more Olive Garden then what you'd expect from a restaurant smack in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. This is consistent what people have stated about Giadas since it opened. The selection in Vegas is too vast to waste time and money on an inferior experience. Thumbs down on this",

My sister has celiac and ordered an entree which was marked Gluten Free. However, when the meal arrived they had substituted broccolini for  a polenta cake. The polenta is Gluten Free however they typically put it in the fryer. #1- they could have fried it separately in a cast iron pan or #2- they should have asked her what else she would like in its place.  It was very pricey for a not so good meal.  Also, one of my dinner companions ended up with food poisoning. Thanks Giada!  Do yourself a favor and choose a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.",

    "text": "Came to Giada for a bachelorette party and had a fantastic dining experience. We started with sparkling water and our glasses were never empty. Our sommelier recommended a fantastic Italian wine, Brancaia, and our server, Nancy gave us the perfect main course recommendations. The starters included bacon wrapped dates with Gorgonzola, ricotta crostini and kale and arugula salads. I contemplated a second order of the dates because the combination of sweet and savory  flavors was outstanding with the kick of pepper. Our main options included lobster ravioli, salmon, bucatini pasta and a filet. The lobster ravioli was phenomenal, with butter sauce and lemon that was exceptional. As Nancy said, the fried Brussels sprouts were addicting. The bucatini pasta tasted better than anything grandma ever cooked and the freshness of the noodles was unmatched. The filet was cooked perfectly and the salmon was seared to perfection. We also had a friend dining with us whose diet is completely vegan and Giada accommodated her with a vegan bucatini and arancini that even the meat eaters enjoyed. We chose espressos, tiramisu cheesecake, sorbet and Bellinis for dessert and the desserts were as impressive as the dinner. What an excellent experience from beginning to end and we can't wait to come back.",

Nothing beats my great great grandfather's recipe, though. ;) Dessert was amazing.. especially the lemon souffle. The atmosphere was lovely and Nancy and Mark provided excellent service.

We both like Giada, and we walked in expecting a homey feel and huge portions of pasta like her television show conveys. It was a bit of a let down overall. All of the hostesses were nice and personable, but it was surprising to see them in the shortest dresses I've seen in a decent resturaunt. We actually saw one couple leave because the wife caught her husband staring one too many times :) We didn't have a reservation so we sat in the lounge area, which was nice but it again just conveyed a typical vegas restauraunt. As for the food, it was good but overpriced, and certainly not very italian. The oysters Rockefeller were $18 for four small bites, and the spaghetti was $34 for a child's portion of dry spaghetti with very little sauce. All in all, if you like Giada look up her recipes, make them at home, and invite your family over for a Giada experience and go to Casa di Amore for good italian food.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch, and the place was packed. Luckily, we had a reservation. This review is only for lunch because the dinner menu is slightly different.  The food gets 3.5 stars overall.  Our table ordered the Gorgonzola pizza with kale and mushroom, the sweet ricotta pizza, the carbonara pasta, the tenderloin sliders, and the muffuletta sandwiches with the fried zucchini. The bread and pesto sauce that came with our meals were delicious, best part of the meal. The tenderloin sliders were very tender and flavorful. The other dishes were average.  Honestly, the pizzas tasted similar to California Kitchen Pizza's, except Giada's crust was much better.  The carbonara pasta dish is small.  I did not like Giada's version of this pasta dish.  The muffuletta sandwiches tasted good, but the bread was a bit too tough and chewy. The fried zucchini side dish that came with the sandwiches was light and perfectly seasoned. For desserts, we ordered the Italian donuts, the gelato, and the crostata. They were also average.  Maybe their dinner dishes will be better.",

I could have sat at the bar, nursed a cocktail, and nibbled all afternoon! Instead, we had a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains, dined on delicious food, sipped a not too pricey glass of Italian red, and enjoyed good service and fun people watching. The prices are a little more than we normally pay, but we had to try it. And we're glad we did. Thanks, Giada, for a divine meal.",

    "text": "Saw pictures of this restaurant and also read some really good reviews about this place so my family and I decided to make reservations and check it out. We did breakfast just to see how it was pretty much get our feet wet to see if it's worth checking out for dinner. I like the location. Very nice view, and also it's up some escalators so it has that feeling it's away from the smelly, smokey casinos which is a nice change. Our server was I believe his name was Juliano (had had an accent so it was a little difficult to understand him) Juliano is what I heard. His approach was very nice and also made sure to give my daughter a children's portion breakfast due to Giada's restaurant not having a children's menu or anything on the menu that a young child would even consider eating due to it being so different,which wasn't a big deal because they made her eggs and bacon with some toast and gave a decent pricing due to it being a small side plate of food. My daughter enjoyed it. Our meals were amazing. Fresh, well cooked, and excellent flavor. Also our fresh squeezed juice was delicious. The orange and carrot juice seemed to be the favorite at our table. My husband got the hash and he said it was really good, and I got the American breakfast it to was very good. My husband and I have already talked about going for Dinner on our next outing so we can see if the dinner is also as good as the breakfast was. And what the heck we will for sure have to eventually check out the lunch too. Our only complaint would have been our service was somewhat on the slow side. It took the server a long time to come and clear plates and give us our check. Whoever was the busser was slacking. We had dirty dishes and glasses on our table for a long time. We gave the food on a scale of 1-10, a 10 and the service a 6. Also my husband showed how the silverware and glasses were not polished. I still give this place 4 stars our of 5 due to the fact the food and location of the restaurant was amazing. We look forward to going back for dinner and or lunch hopefully my next review can be updated with 5 stars and an even better review.",

I barely remember what I ordered... lasange.... & it was just ok not fabulous which it what I had expected. The service was disjointed and slow. One of our orders came 10\" after everyone else's and another had meat on it when supposed to be a vegan dish. The waiter barely took time to stop by our table to check on us and we had to flag him down to point out our missing food & the vegan issue. We ordered desserts but again had to get the waiter's attention.  The check came about 20\" AFTER having to get the waiter's attention and ask him for it. We wanted to do a lunch there, not spend the afternoon!  Perhaps it will get better with time but right now, it is over priced and under organized. I'm hoping it will as I love watching Giada  on the various TV shows and truly love her recipes. I plan to give it another try in a few months assuming reviews are positive.",

My brother was slightly delayed as he dropped off my wheelchair bound mom and went to park the car.  Delayed only a few minutes but enough to irritate the waiter.  The entire evening the waiter was rushed, inattentive and down right rude.  We had to constantly try to get his attention when we wanted to order more drinks, get pepper, etc etc.  When we got the bill, the gratuity was included, which is fine for a party of 7, but you could tell he was trying to hide that fact and get more tip.   Every time food was brought out they had no idea who ordered what so we had to stop conversation and direct them. Ridiculous in a high end place. Go for the food but be aware of the service.",

When we arrived, we were told that some guests were 'just not leaving' therefore it would be a few minutes before we would be seated.  Forty-five minutes of sitting in the bar on very low uncomfortable seats we were escorted to our table, in the bar, next to the kitchen door.  It was a high table with uncomfortable seats.  Then, we were ignored for twenty minutes, finally grabbed a waiter and asked for the manager.   Ten minutes later, a manager arrived.   We relayed our experiences and his reaction was reminiscent of Capt Louis Renault in Casablanca. He was 'shocked' at our experience.   Within a few minutes, water and menus arrived. After placing out orders, the manager returned to offer us a glass of champagne, I'm sure it was Chateau Thames Embankment. When the food arrived it looked interesting.  The interest waned as we tasted our food. All four entrees was dismal, and luke warm.   We discussed sending it back as we were fed up, instead requested our check.   No questions were asked as to why every dish was barely touched.  The check arrived with no adjustment.  The check 'folder' had a device attached, presumably for leaving feedback. It was disabled. Needless to say, we will never return and will tell our tale every possible chance. We had far better food at the Wicked Spoon, also at The Cosmopolitian.",

So imagine my excitement at the opportunity to dine at her restaurant during lunch!  Service: 2.5/5 Nothing extraordinary. We were celebrating our anniversary & was hoping they'd do something special for us but it felt like any other meal to me. We asked our waitress if they could make us crostinis (which we understood was on the dinner menu), but she didn't bother to ask the chef to see if that was even a possibility.   Ambiance: 5/5 They seated us right along the window facing the Bellagio so we got to see the Bellagio fountains show twice during our lunch.    Price: 2/5 Some items I see being overpriced (i.e. my Venetian panino for $18 - the most expensive panino I've ever had by far). We ordered the burrata, which did not come with any bread. A little bit of bread will cost you $6...  Food: 4/5 The food here was quite delicious. Burrata was very fresh and oozing when you cut into it. My favorite item was the Carbonara pizza with an egg on top. My Venetian panino which came with turkey, fontina, and gruyere was also good. However, the flavors didn't blow me away to warrant the extraordinary price.   All in all, it was a good experience. I probably wouldn't come back for lunch though. It looks like they have better options during dinner. At least the view was very beautiful!",

For someone who is mighty full of themselves (which you can tell because she has photos and signs with her face and name all over the place), the food did not live up to the hype. She also has quotes of her diet philosophy up on the lamps-- really? We ordered the pastry basket, the carbonara pizza, the romaine salad and the pasta pomodoro. Really the worst Italian food I've ever had. The pastries came out warm to touch but when you opened up they were cold so really disappointing! The pizza had stale egg yolk and chewy pizza dough (much like her failed Ellen degeneres appearance-- Nicole Kidman was right!!) really unappetizing couldn't even finish my piece. The romaine salad was SOAKED in salad dressing and they didn't bring over their ridiculous pepper grinder which could've been more fun. The pasta was so boring- not memorable at all could get better from chef Boyardee honestly. Cannot believe this lady claims to be Italian! Restaurant was what I feared.. a tribute to a food network chef who finds herself more famous than she is and uses her loud personality to promote her restaurant rather than cook decent food. Really bad- soaking salad. Waste your money elsewhere",

We found our way to the bar where the cocktail waitress didn't even know what beers were on tap but was excited to show us their drink list on an iPad. We ordered our \"sweet baby pepper\" antipasti - literally 4 Costco sweet baby peppers stuffed with a teaspoon of tasteless pecorino and charred for a min (very tough and still raw.) The risotto balls were also very bland and surely rolled in Ragu. We ordered lobster ravioli and and the petit filet to share. Our Lobster ravioli was VERY fishy and the lobster tasted old. We each only had one bite of the dish. Our filet was ordered medium rare and came out way overcooked. The steak was paired with a basic spring mix with vinaigrette and three burnt croutons. The meal was a total flop. The server never came back to ask us how the meal was, and the busser would clear the dishes without saying a world. We finally flagged down the server to ask for our check so we could get to another restaurant to try and salvage our dinner.  We told him how disappointed we were in our experience and to please give the chefs our feedback. He offered to comp the dish and we told him that wasn't necessary and that wasn't why we were offering feedback. In my opinion, he should have comped the dishes we weren't able to finish. He said he hopes we will return to try more dishes in future. I don't think we will return. Our bill with cocktails was $200. The drinks were good, our server was nice and we had a table near the window at sunset. Overall, very poor experience for a celebrity chef restaurant.",

The menu looked pretty impressive with selections from their Breakfast and Lunch menus plus a few brunch exclusive menu items.  Because of the extensive menu, it took a little while to decide what to order.  My mom ordered their Breakfast Contadina.  I couldn't really help but order their Italian Chicken & Waffles because it really caught my attention when I saw it on the menu and I'm also a sucker for fancified versions of the classic soul food combo.  Italian Chicken & Waffles -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1OOLJxm&s=b03a20dcc6bf54f5fae6b74a895d9ed9366ce10e85198870c7d1da75a2cfbbcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1OOLJxm</a> Cacciatore spiced chicken, polenta waffle, parmesan, cacciatore sauce Yeah, this was a serious plate of chicken and waffles for brunch.  The Chicken was flavorful and had a nice spicy kick and the Cacciatore sauce gave it a tangy flavor that I enjoyed very much.  And those Polenta Waffles were on point with a soft interior and slightly crunchy exterior. I just remember when they served it to my table, I was just shocked at how big the portion was for this.  It was a very generous portion, but it was enough for me that I wasn't overstuffed after I finished it.  Yes, I did finish this!!  One thing of note though was that this platter was pricey at $28.  That's just a few dollars more than Bouchon's Roasted Chicken & Bacon Chive Waffles.  But it think the portion size and quality of the food was justified.  I can't really say which is better though, because they're both great in their own way.  Breakfast Contadina -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1TBBsqn&s=b7cb4af7c392f0b72d9d1c20db4236a9123c0a376b5c7cd4d01dcbef191e9646\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1TBBsqn</a> Two eggs served any style, crispy polenta cakes, wilted spinach, oven roasted tomatoes & toast My mom also ordered a side of bacon to go with this since it was more of a vegetarian entree.  From what I noticed, it was a very nice looking breakfast platter and it looked like my mom enjoyed it.  So I've been to Giada for Breakfast, Brunch, and Dinner and all of them have been great experiences.  It just proved to me that you can go there at any time of the day for any occasion and you can't go wrong.  And I do intend to go back again since it's now become one of my must-go restaurants on the Strip.",

    "text": "This was one of the best meals of my life! I don't understand the mediocre to negative reviews at all. Every detail of the night was handled so well and it was a glitch free, very enjoyable evening.  I came with a party of eight to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. We were seated at a great round table with comfy chairs in the center of the room with a view of the bellagio fountains. We were immediately greeted by the host and our server. The service the whole night was spectacular. We never felt rushed and we also weren't just sitting there twiddling our fingers for hours. My dad knew the sommelier Danielle and she was so sweet to our table, making sure everyone was well hydrated. She took great care with the expensive bottles of wine we brought for the evening and made sure everyone had drinks at all times.   The food itself was phenomenal! We started with the antipasti and omg the cheese and meat were so good! The complimentary bread basket was also so great. The warm focaccia and all the dipping sauce were my favorite. There were so many delicious options to choose from on her menu. It's a very well throughout menu.  Our table also split two of the pasta, the rigatoni and bucatini were excellent. I could eat that rigatoni all day! Both were top notch!  My husband and I split the Tuscan ribeye and the spinach and potatoes for sides. That ribeye looks and tastes perfect. It was fatty, flavorful and just as i had hoped.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake and tried the lemon souffle, and my husband received a complimentary lemon sorbetto for his birthday. All were good.  Of course the highlight of the dinner was Giada coming to our table and chatting with us a bit. She was just as genuine and nice as you would hope. She clearly cares about this restaurant and the experience of her guests. I was so happy to meet her as I've been watching her shows for as long as I can remember!  Overall I give this an A++ in my book. Sure it's more expensive than an average dinner, but it is so worth it!! The food and the ambiance are excellent! I can't wait to come back again.",

    "text": "Meh describes it perfectly.  It is a beautiful location, but this pretty new restaurant has seen better days.  Only one word comes to mind with the furnishing, cheap.  Love the intention, but not well maintained.  ALL of the trim should be painted, the leather chairs are worn and the plates and other service bowls have seen better days (chipped bowls and the gold G is worn off).    Super sad, because this was a bucket list for me.  LOVE Giada. LOVE her show.  LOVE her cookbooks (expect the post divorce one, but hey I get it).  And I fully intend to buy her new book, but I will never come back to her restaurant.  The bill for this restaurant was almost more than we spent to stay at the Bellagio across the street for 2 nights.  And we eat out all over the world, so that isn't shocking for us except that the quality doesn't meet the price.  In a nut shell we ordered the La Strada cocktail for $15.  The menu claims it is made of Campari, Limoncello, lemon sorbet and Prosecco.  We called the bar and the recipe they gave was Campari, Sorbet, Prosecco, simple syrup and Sprite.  Sprite?  Really? In a $15 cocktail.  Someone is either lying, clueless or cutting corners.    For appetizers we had the orzo meatballs and the truffle burrata.  The meatballs were an average weeknight meatball $15 for 5.  The burrata was delicious, but they served it with out of season tomatoes.  This caliber of restaurant should not be serving bland tomatoes.  The dinner course for 4 of us was the fried chicken (OUTSTANDING), Ravioli (tiny portion), Risotto (nothing special), and the braised short rib pasta (very under seasoned).  Overall, it's nothing special and for the price it should be, or they should cut the price by 1/3 and call it Everyday Italian.",

We sat in the dining area near the windows overlooking the Strip. It was a cool night so the windows were open and the ambience was perfect. Service was also much better! We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and the waiter made us feel very special.  The food was in a word, delicious. I ordered the lobster ravioli (again). What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. My husband had the shrimp and lemon spaghetti and absolutely loved it! I enjoy a good bread basket and theirs is one of my favorites. The presentation alone is 5 stars.  This may have become our new favorite restaurant.",

    "text": "Oh my gosh! Love Giada's! Giada's is by far, the BEST Italian restaurant I have ever been to! 5 stars! Such a unique experience all around! Giada is actually my favorite chef and I have been watching her since I was 8 years old and I have made some of her recipes and have picked up tips and tricks from her as well as from other shows and just growing up around cooking from my mom and around family! I BEGGED my mom to let me come here for my 21st birthday two years ago and she delivered! Lol! :) I actually wanted to go to Vegas and this was the place I was most forward to going to being that I was excited that she announced her debut and me being a Vegas veteran, I had to come this hot new restaurant! :)   After exploring the lively Vegas, we arrived and I was so happy! I had a permasmile of excitement to celebrate my birthday here! I got dressed up and once I got inside, the decor and the interior was beautiful! From the sign to the marble theme throughout the restaurant, the panoramic view overlooking the Strip was beautiful! The service was excellent and we did a full course meal from the antipasti to the mains and my mom got me the best cake ever- polenta cake, which was so moist, had a unique texture and taste and was so delicious!   First, we had the delicious bread and breadsticks, then we had the bacon wrapped dates! Oh.My . Gosh! Delicious! They had a nice sweet, tangy flavor and I had never tried them before! I do not remember what else we had, but we had so many appetizers! Go for it and try as much as you can! This makes the experience really fun because you are trying new things you have never eaten before! It's awesome! Also, I remember I had this humongous dish which was so yummy! Molto bene! Yum! :) I believe it was the 7 oz filet It was so delicious and I was so full! Now that I just looked it up, our waiter offered us the dinner tasting menu which is family style, so very generous portions, and it was such a pleasant surprise! When you go, do the tasting menu! You will really enjoy it! :) For my first alcoholic drink, I had the limoncello cocktail which was delicious! It was sweet, yet tart, very nice! I had three and I was fine, lol. :) Also, when I went to the bathroom, I was so impressed! I could live in that bathroom! All marble and lit up and very clean and such a nice bathroom!    Thank you so much for a wonderful birthday Mom! I am so grateful to God to have you in my life! :)   It was such a special experience because I was becoming an adult, could drink too (lol!), and I took out time for myself to make an effort and just celebrate my life and give thanks to God for keeping me healthy and happy and thanking Him for all the blessings in my life and just enjoying myself! You have to give thanks in your life and enjoy it! You have to live a little and celebrate all you have! :)   I really hope you all enjoyed this review, more so article, lol! I put my heart into this, as with all my reviews and with anything I write! This was such a special occasion for me and I am so grateful I was able to celebrate my birthday at Giada's! I wish I could have met her, but I am very grateful for an amazing birthday celebration there at Giada's, in Vegas and with my family!   I hope I can inspire you all to be grateful for all you have and to celebrate it! Life is too short to not enjoy it! Live life, live it fully! :)   P.S. I hope to come back to Giada's for a romantic dinner on a date or for any other special occasion! This place is so special and I am so glad I celebrated my birthday there! :)   I don't have those photos anymore, but the memories will forever be in my heart! :)   Ciao ama (Goodbye my loves! )!   Busayo",

    "text": "** Phew. I feel like I just gave birth to a review baby **  It's hard out here for a restaurant on the strip. People from all over the world are setting their sights on you and if you mess up in the least; the hungry huddled masses tend to hop on the haterade nipple. That being said, I had an amazing night at Giada. ** Not to be confused with Giada's Italian Cucina In Anthem ** (which a lot of out-of-owners seem to be doing)  I made reservations for my GF's birthday and requested a strip view. We arrived and were greeted with free glasses of champagne, which they do for everyone during the Friday dinner service. We were sat promptly, and immediately were taking in the amazing strip view at sunset. Beyond the amazing view outside, the view inside is great as well. I love the layout of the restaurant, which has a sunken dining area so people at the bar can view the strip without obstruction.  We ordered two glasses of wine off their digital menu and started the food train rolling'. Eggplant Parmigiana Fries with pomodoro & Parmesan fonduta, Mozzarella with citrus chili pesto, Prosciutto di Parma, Fritto Misto shrimp & calamari with shaved fennel & lemon aioli, Rigatoni with vegetable Bolognese, and a chocolate peanut butter tart with a raspberry sauce. The menu was limited, because a pipe had burst in the kitchen earlier in the day and full menu wasn't available.   The eggplant parmigiana fries were a amazing. Lightly fried, and dusted with Parmesan cheese; these were very light and crispy. They also came with a marinara dipping sauce that was nice addition to the plate, but wasn't needed. A must try.   The mozzarella balls had great texture with a tiny kick. These paired great with the prosciutto, which we only ordered with the server's recommendation. Thank you David! The prosciutto was so good; very thinly sliced and not too greasy. This stuff melted in your mouth. I could have easily eaten a pound of it.   Fritto Misto shrimp & calamari. Wow! This plate was an impulse order and I'm glad we did. The calamari was the perfect amount of saltiness and crunch, plus the added sweet peppers and fennel added freshness to the delicious fried seafood plate.   We shared the Rigatoni plate, because at this point we had already eaten all of the above along with a bread plate that arrives to the table once you sit down. Still... The Rigatoni was perfectly cooked, still firm, but not spongy. The sauce on this stuff was seasoned perfectly and the chunks of vegetables added great texture to the dish.  I used leftover bread to soak up the remaining sauce.   I'm not a sweets fan, but the chocolate peanut butter tart was very good, but also very rich! If you're a sugar fiend this one's for you. I just had a few bites of this and was good to go.   Beyond the food, the service here was fantastic. Very attentive and very willing to make sure your every need was handled.",

The wait staff was adequate, but the hostess station was rude and uninterested in taking care of the clients. I arrived twenty minutes ahead of my reservation and was told our table would be ready at the reserved time. I had a drink in the bar and watched as several parties that arrived after me were seated first. When I questioned the hostess, I was shown to the worst table in the restaurant. I guess that's what happens when you allow a bunch of twenty years olds in short dresses to in effect run your restaurant without any supervision. Perhaps Giada should hire an adult to supervise these children. Done!",

I had the Italian chicken, fried chicken with a catcitore sauce on the side. Delicious. The two other guests had the pork shank, and enjoyed it. We were one of the last tables so I think we got extra desserts. They had a large variety of desserts. The service was excellent. One person in our party had food allergies and they did an excellent job of accommodating it. Top notch. It was pricey, but we got our moneys worth. I am not sure what the other items on the menu would look like, but the tasting menu was worth it.",

When we were sat at our table, the sun was glaring right at us. Since the restaurant was only 20% full at the time, we politely asked for a different table.  The look that we got was unreal!  She rolled her eyes, walked away without saying a word and after a while came back to move us one table over (which was fine, we were just literally being blinded by the sun shining through the huge windows).  However... our server Joseph was completely amazing.  Not overly solicitous yet made himself available whenever we needed anything.  Extremely knowledgeable and professional.  It went a long way to recovering from the rude hostess.    And the food - lemon pasta with shrimp is unbelievable delicious.  Still dreaming about it!",

Once we got food I was Totally sick to my stomach within 20 min and the guy at the table next to us got sick too. Worse than me I think because the paramedics came for him. Our very absent waitress looked very concerned so I asked her if he was sick because I felt sick too (and Im saying this after I ran to the bathroom) she said let me speak to the manager. She came back saying the other guy was dealing with something unrelated and that I'm a special, individual case but still charged us for our full meal. The meals which honestly werent good either.

Not bad,  but not wonderful.  We were still hungry so we ordered the spinach and buffalo pizza.  I love buffalo mozzarella,  but it is relatively bland and needs other flavors to make it pop. This didn't work. We couldn't taste the garlic spread and there was very little spinach. Our waiter was a nice young man,  but didn't seem to have a good grasp of the menu and our wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished. We won't be repeat customers.

The dishes, light fixtures, furniture, colors, artwork, and even the hostess uniforms are all well appointed. Because it's breakfast, I don't want - nor do I expect - to get too adventurous. But Giada made it clear that their eggs and toast are simply much better than others. It's expensive. It's supposed to be. And you should know that going in ($6 for a plain coffee). The staff is friendly with just a sprinkle of attitude, arrogance and condescension. It's an annoying tendency I've been noticing lately in the service industry: Example, A hostess at Chili's becomes quite affected, cool and proud of herself when she becomes a hostess at Craftsteak. You're a hostess, get over yourself and smile.",

We were there for a trade show and my fellow traveler made reservations and was excited about dining at Giada's. The first thing you notice is the over bearing Giada branding, everywhere! Nothing escapes the gilded G, or photos of her. The food was not special, memorable, yet rather expensive. The service was poor -- the server made us feel bad about not \"ordering enough food\" even when we had three different food items and a moderately priced bottle of wine. There was nothing friendly about his service either. I was not impressed on the decor (the entry looks like the home fashions section at a TJ Max) food (can't even remember what we ordered), or service, but it does have a fantastic view of the strip. With so many options in Las Vegas, and so many with better service and food, I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "This Saturday evening my amazing and fabulous 91 year old (a local and Cromwell regular) and I decided to dine at one of our favorite spots. We are SO disappointed to report that we will NEVER be returning. After many memories of family events when the restaurant first opened to when my girlfriends and I come to town- this place will only be a memory. The service was HORRENDOUS! Where to start..hmmmm. Although the pit boss called ahead for us and we were told we could go upstairs to dine they tried to put us in the bar area. Not really a place to enjoy a relaxing meal with my grandma. We moved and were treated by a lovely waiter, Amber. Unfortunately nobody was helping this poor busy girl! The bussers, runners, kitchen, and management must really not enjoy their jobs. We had Amber beg the kitchen about ordering our Burrata while we decide on some food (she's a diabetic and was starving). Lucky us because we were \"allowed\" to order one dish ahead of the rest. Then we asked for regular butter and it took about 5 minutes to get it. We ordered a couple appetizers and one entree to share. To our surprise we received ALL of the items at once! I have never seen such a bizarre set of events. We asked for another roll of bread right when we got the first round and that came at the same time as the food as well! I asked Amber if we could please take a couple items away so we could enjoy our meal and take our time. Of course she accommodated us. My grandmother asked for a plate from a busser because we were sharing. The Burrata was so cold it could make your teeth hurt! Interesting stuff. I was so upset because we had to ask multiple bussers and runners to get us the extra plate. By the time we each had a plate we noticed the octopus was room temperature and unimpressive. I asked the one guy for the manager. He never came. I asked another guy for the manager - who told me he's very busy and can't help. I got of my chair (for the second time to \"help\" the staff get things moving- but this time I was determined to find this manager. I walked up to a man in a suit and asked him if I could borrow him for a moment because I had been asking for him for a while. He came with me back to the table where my Grandma was and I told him how crazy our experience has been and that we are huge fans of this restaurant. George was rude and unfriendly. George, the manager, hardly listened to anything I was saying and made my Grandmother feel awkward. He never said I'm sorry this experience has been different than Jose in the past. She said she's been there at least 7 times without anything like this. I told him that I have worked at many different restaurants and in different positions in them. He literally said \"congratulations\" and after I looked at him funny he fumbled his words and it was even more weird and uncomfortable. I found it rude and offensive and I didn't was just tying to explain to him that I understand that there must be cohesiveness and people working together and that I've literally seen only Amber working and the other people are standing around. he said well what do you want me to do? I was like hmmm weird question. I said well I'm not happy and neither is she and I'm so sad because we love this place. He was silent and I said well maybe you could have them remake the octopus because she's 91 and never had it before! He literally took the octopus off the table and said ok. We never saw George again. He never checked on us and NEVER apologized or made us feel comfortable. We probably should have left at that point, and if I was with my friends we would have (but 91 year old). The rest of the food came and it was pretty good. We had the same plate problem because we were sharing. Asked a couple times and finally came. We also asked a couple times for more marscarpone butter and pesto olive oil and it took a reallylong time to get it. We decided we needed some dessert to spruce things up. The chocolate peanut butter cake was pretty mediocre. Not worth ordering. Anyways my grandma was getting tired so we quickly got the check and to our surprise not one thing was comped or taken off the bill by George. I asked Amber jokingly about him not taking the octopus off or the dessert. I gave her the visa and she was so cute she actually asked him if he could do anything to help our experience and got a big fat No.grandma told her that she's sweet to even do that for us! I told her that I think he was probably the most unaccommodating restaurant manager ever and borderline rude. I said I hope he is nice to the employees unlike the way he treats the guests. Let's just say I can't repeat what she said but I feel awful for the people who have to work with him! On the way out the door I saw many employees just standing around at stations and a couple big tables that were full of dirty plates and glasses. I watched as they were unattended to. Giada - your food is great but your employees seem lazy and unhappy, and George is awful.",

So when I found a Travelzoo special while planning our trip to Vegas it was an easy choice to purchase it and plan our visit.   The restaurant is very nice and the staff very friendly.  The food was very good - but small portions and a bit pricey.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive while not overbearing.  My one complaint was that i like to arrive a little early for a reservation and enjoy a cocktail - but it seemed that the lounge staff was a little overwhelmed at that time and we had to wait a couple of minutes before the table we sat at was cleared and we were given an IPad to review the drink selections and our server promised to be back shortly to take our drink order.  We waited a good 10 minutes to place a drink order until the receptionist came over to show us to our table.  It was disappointing but probably saved me $90 as we were a party of 5 - all of age to drink.  Besides that blip - I'd recommend Giada on your next trip to Vegas.",

I always went for dinner but decided to go for brunch and it did not disappoint at all. We ordered a tasting menu which was $45 and brought pastries, antipasto, an entree, and dessert. For that we got salmon cake Benedict, and a Limoncello souffle (one of the best desserts ever!). We also ordered Strawberry Polenta Waffles, and Scrambled eggs with polenta cakes. Everything was so delicious and I think I could say that I'd rather go for brunch than dinner! They also brought out spreads for the pastries and toast which included almond butter. The almond butter was the best I've had. Not to mention they also have such nice and friendly staff. I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "I want to like Giada Vegas. I really enjoyed my first trip here last year. However, things seem to have really gone downhill. My boyfriend and I were looking forward to a romantic dinner out. We didn't make reservations as it was only March and not busy. We were seated promptly, but put in a back corner near an aisle. The majority of the restaurant was empty and we were well dressed, so I'm not sure why we were pushed aside. Anyway, our server was very warm and welcoming, got us drinks and appetizers to start. We decided to keep our dinner light and share the \"new\" Chicken Cacciatore. I had this dish last year and really liked it, plus I wanted protein. To my surprise the dish was changed drastically from my original experience. The chicken is now fully fried and the tomato sauce is served in a gravy boat on the side. I was eager to try it. I took my first bite, the chicken skin was crispy but the inside was REALLY tender, I wondered what piece of chicken I was consuming. I sliced a second piece and took a bite, only this time it was cold and SOFT. I quickly looked at the piece of meat sitting on my plate and realized the entire piece of chicken thigh was dark pink and COMPLETELY RAW. I immediately spit my mouthful of chicken into my napkin and begged my boyfriend to not take another bite. Honestly, how the hell do you screw that up?! Giada, you served me raw chicken. I can't trust your kitchen. I can't believe your chef argued with my server about it and I really can't believe that I even ate the first bite. Please take this god awful fried chicken cacciatore off your menu and hire a new chef.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came for my birthday. I've heard mixed things, but wanted to decided for myself. We're local and love eating on the strip!! I'm not a huge Italian fan... But was in the mood to mix it up. So glad we came!!!!  I made a reservation about two months in advance via Opentable - asked for a table next to the windows so we can enjoy the view. They say us right away but at a table in the middle of the restaurant. So we went back and asked to be moved - said it would be 20 min. We had no problem waiting.. We wanted to take our time and enjoy the night. So sat at the bar and ordered drinks.   - Hannibal cocktail 5/5 This cocktail was so yummy, huge, and very potent. My boyfriend and I each had two and became reasonably drunk! 100% would order again. And again.   They sat us at a table next to the window. It was perfect! Great view and a little more private because you're not in the center of the restaurant.   Ordered a bunch of apps and pastas. None of the entrees jumped out at me.   - Orzo Meatballs 5/5 Delicious. Loved them    - Stuffed Dates 3/5 Good. But nothing special. They were pretty big but easily forgettable.   - Grilled Octopus 2/5 Easily my least favorite. Nothing special. Sad bc octopus is my favorite dish ever.   - Soup of the Day, Cauliflower 5/5 Wow! So flavorful.   - Beet and Apple Salad 4/5 Very bright and tasty.   - Lemon Spaghetti w/ Shrimp 6/5 This earns a 6 because it was just that good!! I'm still dreaming about it. And the shrimp were huge!! And cooked wonderfully. A must order!  - Risotto with Scallops 5/5 The scallops were out of this world amazing! Hands down the best cooked scallop I've ever had. The risotto was nice, but it's the scallops that earn the 5. I asked the waiter if I could order just a scallop entree next time, and he said they would try to make that possible. I hope so!!  - Cookie Platter 5/5 We were so stuffed but wanted to try the lemon meringue cookies I've read about. All the cookies were amazing!!!! You get six - two lemon, two chocolate chip, and two peanut butter with jelly. So simple and delicious.   We're already planning on coming back for more shrimp and scallops!!  *** side note: the floor around the bar is very slippery. Women, be very careful in heels!!! I saw two woman slip, including myself (thankfully my boyfriend caught me). The waiter saw and asked if I was ok and asked if I wanted to see the manager. I said no but a cocktail might help. But nothing! I guess I should of made a bigger scene... Lol",

However, I was disappointed  the food  was Mediocre at best. We went for lunch because the dinner prices are outrages (even for lunch it's pricey) I got the pizza carbonara, my mom got the muffuletta sandwich and my friend got the lemon pesto grilled cheese. Everything could've been made better at home. For the price and her name everything should've been amazing and the food fell short.   The service was a bit slow and there were only about 10 customers in the entire  restaurant so I'm not sure why that was?   The restaurant is really classy and well put together like Giada herself.  The photo booth was really fun but when we tried to use it again the guest before us moved the camera and the photos were blurry and bright. (They broke it and the receptionist wasn't there to fix it)   The food was a let down. The quality, flavor and prices are could be better. I know we are paying for her name but if I was her I wouldn't put my name on lack luster dishes just for a profit. I won't go back to her restaurant, I'll stick to making my Giada dishes at home.",

We were there upon opening so there where people apparently w/o reservations, however we were seated after them.....It all worked out just thought that was a little off~ The girl who seated us was polite, conversational and pulled all 4 chairs out for us~ slightly awkward however still a nice touch!    Our server Sean/Shawn was very attentive, conversational, polite, well groomed and definitely knew the menu ~ everything we ordered was quite good, can't say delicious.     The starters we ordered the roasted mushrooms, served cold (expected it to be hot, but I could have overlooked this on the menu) they were a very nice assortment of different types of mushrooms. Also ordered the Pasta Fagio soup, good but more like a chicken noodle soup plus goat cheese stuffed peppers, pretty presentation and good, not great.     Main courses also great presentations  on each, 2 Kale ~ Faro salads with goat cheese, the special pasta of the day eggplant lasagna & grilled cheese with prosciutto & pesto served with these interesting zucchini potato shreddings, which were quite different, interesting and a VERY nice change from fries, chips or salad~    Our issues came with desserts ~ we were celebrating a B Day ordered the cookie sampler, gelato selections, zeppoles, 2 regular coffees along with an espresso. The cookie plate had Happy B Day written in chocolate, very artistically done and the cookies were good......and of course they were on the bill~.we just questioned couldn't this been a complimentary B Day dessert? the price was $8.00 so not expensive, and yes they were ordered but REALLY GIADA???? it would have been a very nice way to complete the meal. I suspect that our server could have requested this as an option to be deleted from the bill, but for whatever reason he chose not to quite disappointing.Our bill was over $200 for lunch so again the money wasn't an issue, just seem like very poor customer service, and were LOCALS!!    You have a chance to rate your experience before you leave the restaurant, and we did and all the marks were excellent with A ratings, except the host stand which we gave a B. All in all it was a very nice afternoon, the restaurant is very nicely appointed and pretty with her name or initial everywhere, Hey it's her restaurant so why not? Will we be back? probably, however with sooo many options on the strip it could be awhile.",

    "text": "I have to admit I make fun of Food Network chefs on a regular basis. I was pretty certain Giada was employed due to her giant smile and well... Chest.  I was dead wrong. 100% completely wrong.  We had the tasting menu. It turned out to be a little different than the menu we had looked at online prior to dining, but I have to say even with the modifications, it was basically within the top 3 meals of my life, and that includes 5 meals at Grant Achatz restaurants.  The antipasti platter was great. The focaccia in the cast iron ramekins that comes with the bread plate is something I want to steal and make myself. Sadly, we didn't get any signed menus with recipes like others have reported.  The pasta course was slightly lacking ONLY because I didn't think the quality of the pasta itself was on par with anything I'd eat in Italy. To be honest, the pasta was not al dente. It was crunchy. It could have used an extra minute or two of boiling, and I can almost guarantee it wasn't homemade (Edit: The chef reached out to assure me it was homemade). BUT the sauces were out of this world. I didn't even realize the Bolognese was vegetarian. It was AMAZING. The lemon cream sauce on the spaghetti was so good, I again want to steal it and make it myself.  The main courses were sublime. My rack of lamb and my brother's filet mignon were expertly prepared and couldn't possibly have been any more perfect. They were supremely high-quality cuts of meat, and they were done amazingly well. Surprisingly, the best dish of the night was one of the substitutions we didn't expect. It was the side of creamy polenta with sausage. After I tasted it, I almost wanted to tell my brother it was bad so I could finish the entire family style portion. No sharing.  We apparently got a special treat as far as desserts were concerned. I think it's because our reservation was for 10PM, and we managed to get the last tasting menu of the night. There wasn't a dessert cart to speak of, but they came over and plopped down a platter of SIXTEEN DESSERTS (2 each of 8 different types), explained what each one was, and said \"Enjoy!\" and walked away. We expected to be able to pick a few. We ended up getting all sixteen with whatever we didn't finish packed up in a nice little box to go.  I want the recipe for those ricotta cookies too. The second I tasted them, I knew I'd had them before... From a little Sicilian grandma who has a tiny patisserie in England. I was immediately transported to Italy, and that's a REALLY tough thing to do, as I'm a hugely critical judge of Italian food in America. I actually found myself trying to find little pieces of the cookies that were stuck in my teeth just so I could keep tasting them, and that's something I've never done with any food ever.  In all, it was an amazing experience from start to finish. I'm not sure if Giada reads any of these reviews, but if she does, I just want to apologize for everything I've said about her in jest. Now the things I've said about Guy Fieri on the other hand; I'll defend those until the day I die.",

They said they might be able to seat us a little early. After a few minutes and another asking of when we would be seated, they said we would have to wait for our reservation time. By 10:15 we had been waiting for a while and were ready to get our seat. Unfortunately we weren't seated until 10:30 :( the place was practically empty, so that was disappointing. That being said we got seated. Service was average, atmosphere was beautiful. Seated right on the corner by the glass overlooking the strip, and they even opened our window to let in the beautiful whether half way through!  Food was good.  Our table ordered 5 pastries, all the gluten-free options. The chocolate muffin was the best. Very rich. I ordered the salmon Benedict but I wasn't feeling it and didn't love it after a bite. I switched with my friend next to me, which was the Breakfast Americana. Two poached eggs, lemon smashed potatoes, sweet meatballs, toast and tomatoes. This was good but nothing special. The really great thing is that Giada herself visited the place as we were walking out and we got to meet her and take a photo! Giada was so friendly and sweet it made the experience a lot more fun and made up for my picky eating habits. It was an unforgettable experience.",

It came with crispy fried capers, an olive oil-herb sauce, lemon butter, coarse, ground salt and dried chili flakes. So yummy.  The bacon wrapped dates with gorgonzola creme and spicy sausage didn't measure up. Too much date and the tiny piece of sausage had the consistency of a hard lump of prosciutto.  The candied lemon arrugula salad was perfect as was the chicken lemon soup and lemon souffle.  Unfortunately I hated the veal. They call it a chop but it's really just a thin slice breaded and deep fried at a whopping $52 a la carte.  Wish I'd sent it back... was horrible. Total bill a whopping $175 with the tax and tip plus another  $13 for valet parking plus tip so $195. Yowzer",

The sourcing agent here should ask Viva Arepas where they get their wonderful shrimp. Our pasta course was a tiny bowl of tasteless pasta for way too much money. Not sure what that was about. Prosciutto plate was also kinda bland and didn't pack a flavorful punch.  Service was great and the view of the strip was wonderful from the 2/3 floor.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for my friend's bachelor party.  He goes to Giada's every time he is up there with his fiance, and he always raves about it.  So we decided that our big dinner night would be at Giada's.  We sit down and get our drink orders in.  The ambiance is nice, if a little too dim.  The waiter comes by and takes our orders.  After about 10 minutes, our appetizers come out. Taste: above average to delicious Portion: small, as expected from that type of establishment Price: pricey for the amount and type of appetizers, but again, expected.  We finish our appetizers and wait for our main course.  The waiter comes by once after 10 minutes to tell us that he checked in the kitchen and that the food is almost ready.  I finally get a refill on my water at this point.  After another 30 minutes, our food finally comes out.  During this entire time, our waiter never showed up once to give any explanation as to the delay in our order, or to refill anything.  I had an empty glass of water the entire time.  By the time our food came out, everything was lukewarm to cold.  My friend had the $30 spaghetti which was cold, and my $56 rack of lamb was barely warm at best.  To top it off, the only flavor on my lamb was from the seasoned crust, as the rest of the meat was bland.  By this point, we wanted nothing more than to get out of that place.  To try to save some dignity, my friend told us that we need to order the cookies.  It's $12 for 2 lemon cookies, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 brownie type of cookie.  Really????  You would expect some amazing cookies, but there was nothing special about them.  If you want cookies, go to Mrs. Fields.  Or buy some Chips Ahoy from the market.  It's money better spent.  The staff offered no apologies or explanation or anything.  We were given our food, our check, and that was that.  Needless to say, my friend (the bachelor) was extremely embarrassed by the service given, especially since he was the one who insisted we eat at Giada.  The remaining 6 of us were highly unimpressed with both the food and service, especially the service.  If you're gonna spend about $100 per person on a dinner, go somewhere else where they will treat you like a customer.  It's sad really, as we had such expectations, but I doubt any of us will ever set foot in that establishment again.",

    "text": "I was with a group of 6 on my recent trip to Vegas. One person wanted to check out Giada's, so we figured it would be a great spot for lunch. I loved the idea, as I love her and the Food Network! We didn't make reservations, considering we went around 11am on a Tuesday and didn't  think they'd be busy; they were not. It was no problem getting in without a reservation (and many people behind us also did not have reservations), but we still waited 10-15 minutes for a table. We were sat at a round table that fit us all, so it wasn't as if they needed to put tables together. Once seated, I thought the ambiance of the place was great! Also, being able to see what was going on behind the scenes was fun when we glanced over our shoulders.  Everyone was able to find something on the menu to eat, even with not knowing what some of the terms meant for certain dishes. We had the brunch and lunch menu, which was nice for variety. I ordered the Muffuletta with the Arugula Salad (very good!). My husband ordered the Margherita Pizza (very good). Others in our party had the Strawberry Polenta Waffles, Breakfast American, and a couple other sandwiches. Most enjoyed their food, and it was presented well.  The downfall of our visit was our waiter, which is why I gave it 3 stars. He was not friendly, and treated us like we were teenagers; we all are in our mid-30's. He never gave us drink menus, or offered to answer any questions on items on the menu which we may have questions on. Or went over anything, really. My sister-in-law asked for a Mountain Dew, and she had to specify what it was after he basically told her that he had no idea what that was (they served Pepsi products). After ordering our food, my husband went to the restroom and stopped at the bar on the way back to ask for a drink (beer) menu. A few minutes later,  the waiter came over and spoke to him in a very condescending way about how my husband \"didn't believe him\" about not having Mountain Dew. It was very rude. After looking over the drink menu, I ordered the Giada's Sangria in Prosecco knowing that was the white wine version of the Sangria. The waiter confirmed that it was the white - which OK, but it was the manner in which he confirmed that rubbed me the wrong way. My husband decided on a Pale Ale, and was brought a Brown Ale instead. Due to the comment previously made, my husband didn't feel the need to stir the pot more by saying to our waiter that he may have brought him the wrong kind of beer; he still drank it. The waiter rarely came to check on us to even refill waters, although only had a couple other tables that we could see.  As were were leaving, the 3 of us girls took pics in the photobooth (which is a great idea). We waited and waited and waited for the pic to print out. Finally, we asked the host table about it, and they said it must be out of paper and we could do the pics again. Um... you should have a sign that says it's out of paper so we could have emailed or posted on Facebook. Not a deal breaker, but we were excited to get those pics. We decided just to leave.  So, overall... I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was fun to say that we went to Giada's on this trip. The service was less to be desired and will stick with me more than the food if someone asks me about my experience there. We were not sure why the waiter treated us the way he did, but it was unacceptable. I'll admit, we tipped very small, although for 6 people with meals and drinks - it was a pretty good size bill. There is a very small chance that we'd ever go back during any future trips to Las Vegas and will advise people of the negatives versus the positive. Not a great experience.",

What I didn't expect was to leave having paid $450 for a subpar meal. The proportions are extremely small, which you don't expect for the price you are paying. We ordered the charbroiled octopus, bacon wrapped dates and salumi platter for appetizers. The octopus and dates were very salty, to the point that my relatives didn't eat them.   My uncle and I shared the whole chicken for two that was to be cooked cacciatore style. 1st, this chicken was cut and deep fried, served with red sauce on the side. Nowhere on the menu did it say that this chicken would be deep fried, and I kid you not when I say that this fried chicken tasted like something from KFC. My husband got the salmon which was great. My Aunt ordered the rigatoni (for $26) and it was what one would expect for rigatoni with a bolengese sauce to taste like.   Honestly, I felt a little embarrassed that I had recommended this place as our 'big dinner' while they were in town. The uncreative menu and over salty food made for a poor dining experience.",

    "text": "I don't watch TV and the only food I can make comes out of a toaster. I had no idea the \"Giada\" in the name of this place referred to a renowned woman with many culinary (and cultural) accolades - I genuinely found out who she was about 45 minutes after arriving at The Cromwell for our 7:15 reservations, which is even more amazing/depressing when you stop and realize I was the one who booked the reservation for our meal last Friday night. Nonetheless, for a guy on the outside of pop culture cooking looking in, Giada managed to impress me from presentation to service, while the food definitely delivered on the reputation this gal has made for herself.  Giada sits at the top of a couple escalators, or at the end of a very lengthy white hallway, if you take the elevator, in The Cromwell. I actually suggest taking the elevator because I imagine making that extended walk is how football players feel on their way to the field, or how surgeons get heading for the operating room: lives are about to be changed through that hallway and Facebook photos will undoubtedly be posted. Once you get to the entrance, it's a surprisingly small waiting room to the left of a hostess desk flanked by a duo of dashing young ladies that have style to burn. You can rest on a couple of sofa cushions, head to the right where the bar and bathrooms are, or you could stop in the photobooth near the sofas to kill time and post a few wacky pictures to Facebook - bonus points are awarded (not really) if you are wearing a shirt that makes you blend in with the wallpaper in this booth, like I did (without my maroon sweater vest, I think I would have looked like a disembodied floating head against that background).  We were slightly early for our reservation but in no time at all, a hostess escorted us (still ahead of our time! Score!) to our table in the window overlooking The Strip. The dining room is kind of tiered, with the bar at the top and the dining rooms unfolding outward, blending in chairs and horseshoe-style booths. Now is a good time to mention that the view here cannot be beat if you're in the window seats: major brownie points can only be won with your date when The Bellagio's water show kicks into action across the street and you're on your third bottle of wine.  Our server, along with all the food runners and bussing staff, were attentive without being overwhelming. Following our technological snafu with the \"interactive drink menu\" (read: an iPad), our server got us started with orzo meatballs, a margherita flatbread, a beet-and-apple salad and a couple rounds of this awesome bread combo. I never got to try the flatbread (the four pieces in it were scarfed down quickly) but those meatballs made me question how I've gone this long in life without eating them. Kind of like how I managed to live all these years without tasting lobster ravioli like the kind from here - that ravioli was heavenly, and everyone else expressed similar sentiments for their tortellini and pappardelle dishes.  Before dessert could arrive and threaten to end my life right there via caloric overload, I escaped to the bathroom. This has nothing to do with anything, but aside from being spotless, these were also the best smelling bathrooms I've ever been in. I'm tempted to start doing my laundry in one of the stalls if I could figure out how to get there on a regular basis from Dallas.  With eyes bigger than our stomachs, we opted for a selection of \"Giada's favorite cookies.\" I can safely say this woman knows fine taste: chocolate chip was what you'd expect, the peanut butter (and jelly!) were a pleasant surprise, but the lemon ricotta cookies... I'm not a \"dessert person\" but I think I actually wept while eating those. Tears of happiness and savoriness, mind you.  If there are any nitpicks to make, they are minor. Management was scattered about and did not seem to put too much worth on the customer experience: I think I saw a manager talk to two, maybe three tables. That's unfortunate for a spot like this, as I would like to see the \"higher ups\" at the least asking how everything is, and possibly even displaying a personality and/or a pulse. I also don't know what to think about the special dinner that comes with an autographed picture of Giada herself. It's a cute promotion but, if Giada, or her PR people are reading this, this place is better than that kind of gimmick.  Again, totally minor, practically inconsequential critiques to be made. Sure, the price can be steep if you do not do your homework but look at the complete package: friendly servers and hostesses, a priceless view and a menu that made a believer out of a guy who had no idea who the woman behind everything was. That last part alone should be enough to get your foot in the door if you are even slightly considering this destination on your next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "I was very much looking forward to eating here, but it didn't live up to my expectations (even remotely).  We arrived a little early for our reservation and so decided to sit at the bar, order some drinks and an appetizer while we waited.  The appetizer was the chili mozzarella balls which were decent, the bread seems to made in house and has good flavor, but is a little oily.  The maitre d arrived and said that the table was ready, we got up and asked to transfer the charges to the bar to our table and that's when the server at the bar got all awkward and made out like it would be a problem to do that (no doubt so that she could get her tip on the bar charges) - I don't really appreciate being made to feel awkward about things like that.  We ordered two more appetizers - the wild mushrooms and the eggplant fries.  The mushrooms were very flavorful, but they were expensive for the size of the portion.  The eggplant fries were terrible - they just tasted like oil, we sent them back and were talked into trying the goat cheese stuffed peppers.  They were also not good, the peppers had no flavor and the goat cheese just leaked out of them (the cheese also had no flavor).  We ordered the parpadelle and bucatini for our pasta course.  These were the highlights of the meal - past was cooked very well and my bucatini had a great sauce.  From there you are encouraged to order an entree, but we were full (and slightly underwhelmed by the appetizers and so decided to move straight to dessert).  My favorite dessert ever is tiramisu and given this was an Italian restaurant - and I had seen tiramisu on the menu online, I was ready to order that.  Sadly tiramisu was not on the dessert menu and so rather than try something else we got our check and left.  I really think that anyone could make food that tasted as good as the dishes we had & when I go to a \"celebrity\" restaurant and pay that kind of money I want something that in no way could I attempt to create at home.  For the prices charged I was very disappointed; the \"debate\" about transferring charges from the bar to our table also left a bad taste.  If I could I would give this place 2.5 stars, as you can't & 2 stars would be very harsh I am stuck with giving it a 3 star review.  There are better (and much cheaper) places to eat on the Strip.",

The view of the strip is wonderful and it is a quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas.   My mom and I went for lunch and ordered the wild mushroom appetizer, tuna and white bean sandwich, and baked pasta of the day which was lasagna. We also ordered the \"G\" cocktail and the white sangria. For dessert we chose the Italian donuts and the seasonal fruit tart. Each dish was easy to share. We had very high expectations and our meal & overall experience exceeded them.   The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was True to Giada's cooking style with lots of fresh herbs and hints of lemon. Absolutely delicious. My mom and I were completely nerding out the entire meal and just had a wonderful time together. Anyone who is a fan of Giada must visit her restaurant in Vegas. I give Giada 5 stars for overall experience, atmosphere, and tiny details that were evident throughout the restaurant, food, and drinks.",

    "text": "Terrible/slow service, inaccurate hours listed on the website, poorly managed.   We were looking very forward to trying this restaurant. We had made reservations for 12:45pm on the Saturday after New Years and had arrived early at 12:35. The hostesses were great and seated us quickly- even waiting for our friends to finish taking photos in the photo booth.  Once seated our attentive food runner (wish we caught his name) filled our water and handed us our menus. We asked about the brunch menu and he informed us that the brunch hours and restaurant hours had been inconsistent for the past few months and although the website had clearly said brunch was served until 2pm, we were in fact too late.  After perusing the menu for a few minutes and settling on the fact that we'd be having lunch there instead, we made our choices. Unfortunately, our waiter didn't approach us for 15 minutes. He finally came to greet us and apologized for the long wait and informed us that the kitchen was behind 30 minutes because the computers had crashed.   We didn't see this as an reasonable excuse for the lack of service and left. The hostess could have easily warned us ahead of time. We had high hopes for the place, but ended up having brunch at Mon Ami Gabi and were completely satisfied as usual.",

If I could offer a constructive comment - There seems to be a conflicting style in the restaurant.  When you walk in, you see a rustic chic style, then you are greeted by a reception staff in black dresses that are to short and to tight - more like young girls on their way to a club.  And then, there is the photo booth.  On to the dining room and you have well dressed waiters trying to provide a five star experience.  To many personality styles and it presents a confusing experience.  Management should come together to provide a more consistent experience and deliver a more consistent message.",

    "text": "I made reservations a month in advance and I was only able to get the 9pm slot. We parked at Caesar's since the Cromwell doesn't offer free parking and still  arrived early.   While we were waiting, we noticed a complimentary photo booth, so we took some cutesy couple pictures and were able to upload them to our email.  When we got seated, we were served with three different types of bread. My favorite was the rosemary focaccia bread dipped in olive oil and sprinkled with capers, sea salt, and chili peppers. We were also given complimentary elderflower honey lemon spritz. This tasted so light and paired perfectly with the bread!  We decided to get the tasting menu and added the orzo meatballs everyone since was raving about them.   The meatballs were tasty and so tender! They came sprinkled with plenty of fresh parmesan cheese and just melted in my mouth.  The first course was the antipasti, with bell peppers stuffed with gooey cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and crostini carpaccio.   We both ordered the lemon spaghetti with jumbo shrimp since this was another of Giada's specialty. The portions were huge but delicious. Sadly, I had to leave some on my plate as I wanted to make room for the following courses.  The third course was the Sicilian roasted lamb, medium. It came with a side of smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage. We were able to eat everything!!!  We were able to choose three desserts each from the dessert cart and we ordered lemon ricotta cookie, chocolate truffle, strawberry sherbet, petit four, and cheesecake with strawberry topping. Everything was topped off with two glasses of sangria each.  The service was fantastic! Our waiter, Frederick, constantly checked in on us and was attentive and friendly.   At the end of the meal, you receive Giada's autographed picture with the breakdown of the tasting menu and a couple of her recipes! :-)",

    "text": "Giada, I hope you read this.  I have owned my own restaurants and quite frankly, I was embarrassed for you.  Firstly, the hotel needs to give the restaurant better signage.  We were given misinformation about where the restaurant was and took the wrong set of elevators up.  We found a manager on the floor who told us that happens to guests all the time.    My husband and I arrived at the front desk and were made to wait for 15 minutes with a half empty restaurant.  Since he was on oxygen, I thought this was inexcusable.  While waiting I walked over to look at the assortment of olives etc. in the display and noticed the bread platters set up for service.  Almost all the dishes were cracked and looked like dishes that should have all been rejected for service.   We were seated and enjoyed the Dry Cured Basque Salume, and Parmigiano-Reggiano appetizers.  Our server highly recommended the signature Spaghetti with shrimp, lemon and basil.  When it arrived it was under cooked, not hot and did not have the slightest taste of lemon.  We were very disappointed.   Overall I would not recommend the restaurant but gave it two stars because we had a server who did a good job.  He did remove the cost of the spaghetti from our bill.   They need to get back in there and take a good look at what is going on.  It needs serious help.",

    "text": "For starters the 3 young women at the check-in desk looked like they didn't have a clue what was going on. They just stared at their computer screens. My wife had made a reservation many weeks in advance of our visit, and requested a window table. We arrived about 15 minutes early so we went to the bar for a drink. Another unknown couple joined our table. The cocktail waitress handed us an iPod showing the drink menu. So far, OK. I ordered a Stoli on the rocks that was listed at $14. They brought the drinks and we waited. She said we could start a tab and take our bar bill to the table. Then the cocktail waitress came over and said one of our tables was ready, but she didn't know who. So I went up to the front desk and asked, and they said I had to settle up with the bar before we could be seated. So I did. They charged me $19 instead of $14. When I asked why, they said it was because the listed prices were for a martini, not an on the rocks drink.  We were seated at a table nowhere near the windows. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, a caprisi salad and the lobster ravioli to start. The waiter brought the dates in good time. I thought they were just OK, and after the second one the taste was so sickly sweet I couldn't eat more. Then we waited and waited and waited. At least 45 minutes passed when our waiter came up and apologized, saying the kitchen was overwhelmed with an influx of 200 guests. I thought this was a poor excuse. It was a Saturday night, they knew how many reservations they had, and should accomodate accordingly. We were about ready to walk out almost an hour later when the food arrived. The caprisi salad was bad. The tomotoes were tough and the dish had little flavor. I took 1/2 bite of the ravioli and put my fork down. This stuff was tough as leather, had no flavor, and was lukewarm at best. My assumption was our food sat in the kitchen for some time before being delivered. But even then, the pasta was not cooked well. So we complained and the assistant manager came to our table. She apologized up and down, offered spaghetti, cookies, etc. At that point I just wanted to get out of there. The damage was done. She was generous enough to not make us pay for the bill. When we asked why we couldn't get a window table after specifically requesting it on the reservation WEEKS in advance, she said that only if guests can guarantee they will spend $100 per person, they don't give you a window table. REALLY? And of course none of this was mentioned when booking. On top of this it was my birthday, they knew of this thanks to my wife's reservation, and this is what we got. We won't return. Maybe go there for a drink then eat somewhere else. We had a more enjoyable experience at Fuddrucker's. I'm sure Giada would not want her name associated with anything we experienced there. I can cook better at home.",

After being so excited about finally dining at Giada's restaurant, we left completely disappointed at the small ridiculous portions and overpricing on the menu items. I mean, taste wise the food is amazing but the portions and price of the food was outrageous and as my mother put it \"offensive\" to digest.  The service I would say fell on the bottom of the barrel. The moment we walked in, up to the point of having ordered refreshments was a complete mess. My cousin ordered a Shirley temple and it came with flat club soda and 3 cherries. The server mentioned that they had run out of grenadine - but then my cousin decided she wanted a sprite instead. The server come back with flat soda water. Also, came back (non-apologetic for The most part)  we ordered bread while we waited for our meals and we literally got 1 piece of bread for The entire table!! Not making this up... Our waiter Nancie was pretty good at the end but throughout was not very friendly AT ALL - she was almost rude and sarcastic which was very shitty.  I have been to 3 star restaurants and have received better treatment. In all actuality the prices and portions are the most disappointing.",

    "text": "What a disappointment our anniversary turned out to be.  We made our reservation about 45 days in advance declaring the evening as an anniversary and judging by the times still available through open table the restaurant seemed pretty open.     First we arrive and check in at the top of the escalator and are met by a gang of twenty somethings.  We give our name and they wish us a happy anniversary (this can only be a good sign I think).  Next we are left to fend for ourselves.  No one tells us where we can wait while they get our table ready (for a town built toward hospitality this is a Vegas first).  So we are stuck in limbo.  The tiny seating area with a photo booth is full (there are 2 other couples waiting).  So we decide to awkwardly check out the menu and some news articles down a hallway.  As we are mulling in the hallway there are other patrons arriving and they are being escorted to a seating/waiting area inside the restaurant (apparently one of the twenty somethings doesn't need twitter to communicate....I'll chalk that one up misfortune).  Eventually someone comes and gets us and our Giada experience is about to begin.  Well, I wish I could tell you what the restaurant was like inside once we were seated, but instead we were seated in the bar area.  When questioned about the seating, one of the twenty something hostesses meekly grunts that this was all they had.  I should have used my angry/disappointed Emoji on my phone instead.  Maybe then she would have figured out the message.  So I get an awesome view of a bar and a TV with preseason football playing (not sweet).  My beautiful wife (a huge Giada fan, she makes me sit through all of her episodes instead of letting me watch football) she gets a view of a wall with 3 large paintings. It looks like she will have a huge portrait of the patriarch of the De Laurentiis family overlooking her every move tonight.     As we sit there 3 other unfortunate couples are flocked to these 4 tables that should absolutely only used as the best bar tables and in no way ever be used as dining seats (especially when for a couple celebrating an event that made a reservation weeks in advance).  One by one we see the same disappointment on their faces as they realize they will be eating in the \"cupboard under the stairs\" with Harry Potter.  Let's move on shall we.  With that over and my disappointment waning we got to focus on the food.  We ordered a couple appetizers, the orzo meatballs and artichoke arancini. Score!  Our waiter proclaims those are his favorites (although, I did hear him say that to the other unfortunate souls sharing the cupboard with us....whatever I'm still comforted by the statement).  They both were good, but needed more salt and seasoning.  The arancini took the day.  Next we ordered the pappardelle and ravioli.  Both were good again, but served as an appetizer.  The pappardelle allegedly had pork ragout, but it seemed missing in action this night.  The ravioli was very good.  It was served with a butter sauce underneath and 2, yes 2 asparagus tips.  It reminded of me of eating a steamed lobster with warm melted butter, but with the lobster being wrapped in a pillow of pasta.    Essentially, everything on the menu seems to be served tapas style.  The only problem is that the price tag of $36 and $32 for tapas is a little ridiculous.  But hey, we are paying for the experience and it looks like the Eagles just put Tim Tebow in the game and though my wife never says, I assume the portrait of Dino remains unchanged.    Overall, Giada's was not worth it.  There are tons of Italian restaurants in this town and just value alone will keep us away.  Throw in marginal service and the fact I may be eating in a broom closet seals that. But, judging by how busy they were, they will hardly miss us.     Food:  3.5 stars (hey, my plates were clean when then took them away) Value:  1 star (proportion sizes don't match up) Service: 2 stars (our waiter and his assistant moved the scale two stars from the zero star hostesses that only know how to communicate on a samsung or apple device). Atmosphere:  No star (having a preseason football game as my eye contact breaker was not what I had in mind for our anniversary.  Oh and thumping some J.T. like I was in a club doesn't seem to match the \"Giada\" brand)  Anyways, finished the evening off with a burger and shake from in-n-out, so really how bad of a night could that have been?",

    "text": "Let me start by saying  I am a huge fan of Giada and Italian cuisine. I make my own pastas and pizzas from scratch and have dined at some very well respected Italian restaurants across the country and abroad. I have made some of her recipes before and really enjoyed them. The burata was amazing and the the orzo meatballs were exactly how they were described by the bartender. The grilled artichokes had just the right amount of aioli to compliment them and I was quite excited to have her signature dish which is the Spaghetti with Lemon Basil and Shrimp. Once the dish was brought out (about 30 minutes) I was quite disappointed with the size. The presentation and aroma were spot-on but the portion (which the bartender said was a dinner size and not really a secondi) was tiny which is the opposite of the price ($34 for pasta that fits in the palm of your hand?). The disappointment did not end there. I found the pasta to be very sticky and doughy although the taste was phenomenal. The single shrimp was cooked perfectly and the lemon and basil were the perfect balance. But overall as my main dish I was not happy with the pasta. The overall experience would have been below average for me if it had not been for the dessert. I was talked into the special chocolate torta which was amazing. It paired perfectly with the glass of recommended wine and kept me from reviewing the restaurant poorly. Overall I did not think Giada was a value (I know its vegas) but it was a wednesday night and I think maybe the \"B\" team was on in the kitchen. I still would recommend giving it a try but do not go with the \"signature\" pasta. The meat and cheese plate looked robust and diverse. The rack of lamb that the gentlemen next to me at the bar said was the best lamb he ever had for what that is worth.   Try it out!",

    "text": "I'm sorry Giada. It's been said before, but I am your biggest fan, and like most Foodies I love you for your charm, class, and most importantly, your cuisine, and maybe holding you up to that pedestal turned this much anticipated dining experience into a fail.   We took our most important client to Giada to really WOW them, and luckily the good outweighed the not so good this evening, and I am positive that you yourself would have been disappointed on several key points.  First the good. Giada is located on the second floor of the new and very chic Cromwell hotel. Upon entering the host staff was attentive and perfect. Moving into the restaurant the antipasto bar and kitchen, as well as the overall ambiance and layout of the restaurant was outstanding. You could also see Giada's touch in the tableware and glassware selection. The view of the strip and the fountains of the Bellagio were outstanding. So far so good.  This evening I had decided to order for our guests family style. Having selected most of Giada's signature dishes prior to arriving my plan was to have an uninterrupted meal by not having to have every guest be distracted by the extensive and creative menu. Upon seating I discussed with our waiter, who was also excellent, that I would be ordering appetizers, salads, pizzette, salads, as well as a pasta and family style main course. I outlined our selections prior to even ordering cocktails and wine selections, and what happened next was simply inexcusable, and the reason I would never return. Before we could hardly finish placing our cocktail order and wine, here come the appetizers, all of them, too many to even fit on the table!   I have no idea how they could have even been prepared so quickly. I waived half of them off and asked the waiter to please pace our dinner!  At least let us have a drink in hand before all of the food arrives.  I understand the importance of turning tables at a new hot spot, but this was a terrible start for sure.  As for the cuisine, the bread service is excellent and creative, with a very nice skillet focaccia, cheese crisps, and breadsticks. We started with the bacon wrapped dates with sausage, and what can be bad about anything wrapped in bacon?  They were good, but the texture was a bit dense. We then had the Artichoke Arancini, which seemed to be void of artichoke, and nothing special. Next I had wanted to order the signature Mortadella pizzette, only to be told that I would enjoy the margarita pizza much better, that the Mortadella pizzette was simply \"Shaved Italian bologna on top of a crust\". The margarita pizzette was only okay, and I have had way, way better.  So much for the highly anticipated Giada appetizers.  The next course however was a winner!  The signature Tri-colore salad, with dates, kale, lettuce, and a healthy helping of a very fine quality prosciutto. Everybody raved about the salad and we seemed to be back on course...no pun intended. Next came the pasta course, and I had ordered another signature dish, Giada's Ziti. Although the ragu was delicious, the pasta itself was on the hard side of Al Dente. Scott Connant would have ridden Giada for this misstep.  Finally I had been drooling for our final main course, Giada's highly acclaimed Chicken Cacciatore. The plating was unique, with the actual ragu delivered on the plate in covered ceramic pots, and the roasted chicken arranged on the plate around it. Again, the ragu was excellent, but the very plain looking roasted chicken was dry, and the plate completely void of any garnish.  It would have probably been a better idea to serve the dish traditionally with the chicken actually covered by the ragu, which might have masked the dryness of the chicken.    Finally the dessert cart came, and for the cost of the desserts I took one look and asked where the \"grown-up\" servings were.  We passed on dessert and went elsewhere to finish our evening.  Giada, I love you, but again, I think if you were on-site that you would have been disappointed this evening.  We left feeling that this was not Giada's restaurant, but simply a new restaurant that just happened to have your name on it.  That said, I give this 3-Star rating for the ambiance, class, and creativity, but there is way better Italian to be discovered in Las Vegas.",

We got a tour of the open kitchen, which is awesome. We had Italian sausage and bacon wrapped dates and mascarpone and goat cheese stuffed sweet baby peppers for appetizers. Both 10/10. I love dates, but a lot of times you get over-rich dates. Not these. For dinner we shared a chicken cacciatore, lemon ricotta asparagus, and crispy polenta. Asparagus qnd chicken were absolutely amazing. Polenta was great, just not on the same level. They have like 12 different desserts to choose from, we got two. Delicious. All of the staff is great, the manager checked on us twice personally, and Turley was just the best. I will come here every time I go to Vegas. Its a must-have dining experience.",

    "text": "My husband and I along with 13 of our friends all attended dinner at Giada's for a friend's birthday. Let me start out by saying that I was a huge fan of Giada prior to visiting this restaurant. we were seated in a very nice private dining room that had a balcony looking out over the Las Vegas strip. My husband, a friend, and I ordered the surf and turf and aother two of our friends had the Spaghetti (lemon / basil) with shrimp. the steaks all came out under cooked (very rare) and luke warm. The Spaghetti was overwhelming with a lemon kick, but is not bad if you are a serious lemon lover. After our food was delivered our party had to ask for Parmagiano cheese and then we never saw our waiter again while we ate our meal. My steak was so rare that I could not finish it. no one came in to see if we had everyhting we needed. one of our friends ordered a side of potatoes and they were never delivered yet they still showed up on our bill. I had one drink with our meal and our total, for my husband and I, came out to $166. In my opinion this was a horrible value for a meal that was half eaten. I would skip this location and go to either Emeril's Steak house or Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I was extremely dissapoined with this restaurant and it's lack of quality control and customer service. They did serve our party with proseco based shots, but that was way too little too late, the damage had allready been done.  A manager never even took the time to come talk to us, we were not looking for any thing except a little customer service...",

    "text": "Rip off. Went for lunch for my birthday. We had two starters that I believed were little bites that one sometimes gets free in this class of restaurant. But they were what we ordered! A dish of mixed mushrooms which were tasty but such a tiny portion! Then 5 mini mini stuffed peppers on a tiny little plate. My husband had gnocchi, a portion so tiny he said he would be eating lunch when we got home. I had a spinach salad with a flavorless grilled piece of chicken breast, a few slices of apple and a bit of blue cheese. It had a very tasty dressing. Size was ok for me but it was an appetizer size. No drinks no dessert and our bill was $80.00! Our waitress over filled our water glass, did not bring bread or lavash crackers - had to ask for them as well as salt and ground pepper. No Parmesan cheese offered for gnocchi Brought my husband an espresso which she spilled on to the saucer and I sent it back before it dropped all over his shirt. I live in Las Vegas and we avoid the strip for this reason. It's over priced. I will not go back. How difficult is it to serve normal portions   The pizzas looked pretty good",

I came here on Sunday night August 2 to celebrate my birthday, what a waste of time, first let me say that none of the employees know what a dining booth is, when I made the reservations I asked to be placed in a booth, and the young man said that he would make notes and that there were no guarantee that there will be one available but he will make the request which was OK, when I arrived I told the hostess that I requested a booth she turned and said yes we have a booth for you, she took us right to a banquette, there was not one booth inside of the whole restaurant, we' asked to be seated somewhere else they stuck me in the back room next to the wine cellar, OK not really a big deal, started out with two appetizers orzo meatballs and some other type of balls not impressed enough to even remember the name, they both were horrible, I've never had a tasteless meatball before then, she should be embarrassed to even call herself Italian! I should've stopped there but I wanted to give my main dish a chance, so I ordered the Branzino.... Big mistake! I don't understand how this restaurant is getting great reviews, maybe someone in the kitchen is just mad with her and is purposely trying to ruin her! Save yourself some time and money and go to Rosati's on Grand Teton and Durango, now that's Italian!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for our 21st Birthday dinner about a week or two ago. Let me first explain how disappointing the experience here was. Firstly, we love Giada, were big fans of her on food network, so we thought the restaurant would do their best to represent her in the best way possible. So we made reservations for 10 PM, we tried to move the reservation to an earlier time about 5 different times, and weren't able to however the receptionist said \"you can come in earlier, and if we have a table available we will accommodate your party and seat you earlier\" Thats great. So we got their at 9:30 PM. Checked in, Photo Booth was broken. Waited and Waited. 10:05 comes and now were becoming impatient. We asked the girl at the front how much longer it was going to take she said they were setting up the table. At 10:05 they were setting up the table for a 10 PM reservation. THATS AWESOME. We explained that we are from NY. Us NY'ers do not like to wait. We expect to be seated at the time the reservation was made for. At 10:10 we grew even more impatient. Again, the girl at the front gave us an attitude and said \"they're setting up the table\". Anyways, we finally sat down at 10:15 PM. It took them 15 minutes to set up a table with 5 plates. Got the the table SUPER DISAPPOINTED. They took two random tables from the restaurant pushed them together. Mind you these tables were different heights, and had the five of us sit at these two tables pushed together at two different heights. Im glad it took them 15 minutes to put together this eye sore of a table. It only went downhill from there. Service is terrible, extremely slow. If your patient thats great you'll love this place. I ordered the Farrotto. First of all, this is labeled under \"Pasta\" this is clearly not pasta. Its BUCKWHEAT. unless your Russian and you love eating your kasha in the morning this is not the entree for you. It was undercooked and terrible. My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini. Also a huge disappointment. Overcooked pasta that tasted like Udon noodles. Other than that the Arugula salad was nothing special. The pizza was also nothing out of the ordinary. Ive had better dollar pizza here in NY. Anyways. This isn't really an astonishing Italian restaurant. Were big foodies, and overall the experience was really disappointing. Let's just say I had very high expectations of this restaurant until we sat down. I was also drawn in from the other great experiences people have had.",

The peppers so sweet in a \"you want more\" way. not too cloying.  the pasta (lemon pork) was a little salty, but everything was so beautifully presented and you could tell there is an eye on all the details from the hostesses dresses and place settings.  Service on the other hand was abominable and shocking.  Arrived after a show at 10:30pm (they close at midnight).  We were introduced to our server who we are assuming went home because he was no longer there and we had a new server who didn't miss a beat how to up-sell even when i told him my range on the wine list.  this actually is a pet peeve - but let's say that's what you should expect in vegas and let it go. but then food came out on top of each other and 1 hour later (only 11:30pm) the server starts clearing plates when one of my friends is still eating.  it was shocking! then the they started vacuuming the restaurant and I went to check to see if they were closing early and should we leave.  no manager to be found. and they said don't worry to stay (while the vacuum cleaner is going.  No thanks. No room for dessert either at that point.  I'll stick to being a fan on food network or hope Giada opens a restaurant outside of vegas where they've got the service in check.  Amazing food!",

    "text": "My complaint is not with the food or the prices its with the actually waiter, or waiters. My first experience was around August of 2015. There was a group of us that went, the waiter was very short with us and rushing us. He felt irritated by questions that were being asked. The others servers or people that were helping him were very helpful and nice but he was rude and had no patience. We loved the food so much we still wanted to come back another time to give it a second chance. I made reservation's for my sisters birthday on December 16, 2016. Right away the people bringing drinks and our bread were very nice and friendly our waiter not so much. He was to busy flirting with  the other woman he worked with than helping us. We placed our order and so excited about our food. Someone else brings it out and I personally was missing 2 items I ordered. The waiter came back so late that we were already done eating and I was over it by then. I waited to get the bill to see if I would get charged for the items I ordered as to bring to his attention that I never received them. We got the bill and the items were not on there. Someone brought my sister a nice Happy Birthday plate with cookies. I Wanted her to have a good night and not frustrate it with my complaining.  If the waiter had spent more time helping our table than flirting with other people  we would have spent more money and time and would probably be going back. 2 for 2 with bad waiters does not sit well with me. I have to say the food is excellent though.",

    "text": "Went for lunch with some foodie friends.  The ambience was very nice with lovely and interesting decor. Several of the dishes were very good.  However, the lobster sandwich was full of shells.  I know extracting lobster meat is difficult so I expected there might be a few shells as you might find in most places.  However, after spending every single bite taking shells out of my mouth it got a bit tedious. I know if Giada made this on Chopped she would have been chopped! My main complaint is that when I mentioned it to the bus girl who was about to take my half full plate away, instead of saying she was sorry and would mention it to the server, she told me it was normal, and \"didn't the server warn you there would be shells?\" So then the server did not apologize either.  I asked if there was anything else I could order with fewer shells and she said \"no\". She said \"It's normal there are shells in it.\" She proceeded to take my half full plate away and charged me for the whole dish. Very unprofessional, I thought.  At lower end restaurants I expect a few shells here and there and don't complain about it.  I am thinking a very nice restaurant like Le Cirque in the Bellagio would never have shells.  I can't believe Giada has instigated it as policy that the servers as a matter of procedure warn the customers there will be shells in the lobster sandwich.  Is that really the level she wants to set?  That is disappointing.",

We had a couple of minutes between courses to digest and prepare ourselves for what was next. Things were great.  We were both thrilled with our choices by the time our mains came around. With the tasting menu you each get a side with the entree. Most of them were loaded with meat but our waiter told me they could do the peas without. Perfect.  That is until I got two or three bites in to them and I picked a chunk of meat out of my teeth...  At this point I'm pretty much finished eating. I'm feeling gross and a little sick and I barely had a third of my entree. Our waiter apologised and offered to have more peas made. I told him I was finished.  They clear our table and the dessert cart comes around. You get five each with the tasting menu and I ask if we could get them to go and the dessert cart guy says   \"Giada wants her customers to experience everything at it's freshest so we don't make desserts to go.\"  I pointed out that Giada probally wouldn't want me eating meat in a vegetarian dish and he just shrugged his shoulders. Not very helpful, but he gave me a look like his hands were tied.  So 80% of our desserts were wasted. I went back to our hotel feeling awful and it cost us over $300 after the tip.   Not worth it.  My wife was happy with her meal, but we are not going back to a place that served me meat and didn't try to accomodate us after it was pointed out.",

    "text": "After a whir-wind trip to Vegas for a trade show, I was looking forward to having one \"Special\" meal at Giada.  We got one of the last 3 reservations for 5:15 and arrived about 5 when the restaurant opened. We garnered a great table overlooking the fountains and each ordered a drink. We got a kick out of the \"G\" in the ice cubes.  We proceeded to order several appetizers including the eggplant and the Ricotta with honey, lemon and peppercorn. The eggplant was good but the ricotta dish had too much honey so it was more like a desert than an appetizer.  It was about this time that I noticed a chip in the bottom of my bread/appetizer dish. I pointed it out to the busperson, he took it away without an apology and never did bring another dish for me.   The things that I really did enjoy were the bread plate which had a small crock of warm foccia, 3 small breadsticks and a flat bread along with some lemon butter and the best thing about the visit, the fried capers. I found a new addiction with these tasty toppers!  All three of us then ordered the Risotto with crab and scallops. It was well prepared and tasty although the crab seemed a little \"fishy\". I guess you get spoiled living at the ocean with the freshest seafood.  I passed on desert as I was not feeling too well on the appetizer although my friends shared and loved one of the deserts.  As we were finishing up, my friend noticed there was a chip of glass out of the bottom of her water glass! Two chips in one meal....that was bizarre. They have someone walking around polishing the glasses at empty tables, but apparently not looking for things that could harm their patron.  After we had paid and were leaving I asked to speak to the manager to tell him about this so he didn't think we were trying to get a discount on the meal. He said thank you but didn't really offer an apology. This is a relatively new restaurant, I don't remember ever having 2 chipped plates/glasses even at the lowliest chain restaurant. That really made what should have been a \"world class\" experience, a \"meh\" event. Giada you should be looking at the plates and glasses, not just the plating.",

    "text": "Being a giant fan of Giada I was so excited to hear she opened up her own restaurant here in my hometown, sin city. I found out the wait list for her restaurant is about 4 months long and saw my hopes of dining there slip away. Come to find out my best friend surprised  me by making reservations months in advance for my birthday and my dreams came True.   We had 1:45 reservations, we walk up to the hostess at about 1:20 to let her know we were in the vicinity, she made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with us until our strict 1:45 reservation time. Our time came and I went back to the desk to let her know we're ready, she had our table ready very promptly at 1:45.  The dining area at first glance is beautiful, pristine white makes everything look sparkling clean. We are seated and In a few moments the waiter is over. He goes over the menu in depth and gives us a moment to decide.   When he returns he answers all our questions in great detail and listened to our Specific needs (one of us doesn't eat meat). We ordered the wood roasted mushrooms and chicken orzo meatballs to start. Also ordered two muddled strawberries which is a brilliant concoction of tea,lemonade,strawberries, and basil. All Of these dishes were an absolute smash. We order our main dishes which were a frittata and Giada's lasagna. Both of these dishes were great and we had not a single complaint with them. They also bring you a sort of pita bread with a pesto oil spread which is great as well. They have a gentleman of whose job it is to make sure your water is always full which was nice. With it being my birthday we of course ordered dessert which was a tiramisu and a cappuccino of sorts with Nutella. They even wrote \"happy birthday\" in chocolate on my Plate. These Desserts really smashed this experience through the roof.  As we wait for the waiter to bring the bill I see Giada Herself talking to some patrons in the restaurant. My heart of course stops and our waiter personally asked her to come to my table because it was my birthday. She sat and took a picture with me, wished me a happy birthday, made sure our lunch was everything we expected, and said she liked my hair. I died on the inside. The food was awesome, our waiter was a class act, and the Giada was everything I'd hope she be.   The reasons I gave this four stars ........ The epic waiting list which reaches 4 months Is extreme but totally understandable. The portion sizes of these dishes are minimal at best and very pricey.   Everyone should definitely try this restaurant. Not a place to get full but a dynamite venue for a special event. From the food to the staff to Giada herself an absolute smash.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch with the girlfriend and friends before heading back to LA. heard about this place and one of our places to eat in vegas list. Girlfriend and I Decided to try the Brunch tasting menu, it consisted of a basket of pastries, antipasta plate, a main entree and dessert, Received the basket and antipasta plate, but was very confused because we only got one of each, \"Didn't we order TWO brunch tasting menu?!\" I would assume we would each get one of each. the assorted pastrie basket had only two pastries in there, the antipasta had 2 deviled eggs, salami, and one other item. I asked the server if they were missing two additional plates, they told me they combined them together, Umm I didn't ask for them to do that. Let alone the portion size was so small. So imagine if I had only ordered the tasting menu, would I would get the exact same thing, or less. I felt very cheat on the portion. Receieved the chcken and waffle plate as the entree, the plate was delicious for what it was, dessert was the lemoncello souffle, was okay. Service was pretty prompt, had my water refilled literally more than 5 times, they were very attentive. Our view was beautiful, by the window where we could watch the water show at bellagio. Could be better. restaurant needs some work.",

We ordered 1 of every pasta, the spaghetti was the best, although even that was not great.   The shrimp and prawns were so overcooked we didn't even eat them, they were so tough you couldn't even cut through them. Had I not been with a group I would have sent several of the dishes back.   To top the whole experience off, service was appalling. From the waitress to the people that brought our food out. When our food arrived we asked if they could tell us what each plate was and the response was a non comical aggressive tone where they said \" you tell us which plate is what.\" It got worse from there .  I wish we had gone to one of the many other great offerings in Vegas! Olive Garden would have been a better choice.",

    "text": "The food tasted okay, but we've definitely had better dining experiences, and for less money. The ambiance was nice and the decor was modern. This restaurant spends a lot of money on iphones and ipads, and having more staff than it needs, but what customers ultimately expect of a Food Network star is that the food be some of the best they have ever had. We felt that our money was mainly spent on the Giada brand.  On our arrival, we learned that our reservations had been overlooked, so we had to wait at the bar. It wasn't a big deal and this isn't factored into our rating. We did end up with the best seats in the restaurant, where we could watch the Bellagio water fountain show. It was good, but totally accidental on their part, so this also isn't factored into the rating.  The bar tender was nice, but he seemed deeply disappointed that we didn't order anything. Sorry, we were just waiting for the table, not planning on drinking. We were then escorted to our table.  The service was very aggressive. I don't know whether it's Americans' insistence on tipping as a percentage of sales rather than a flat tip based on servers' performance, or whether the restaurant trains its staff to be so pushy. But I can't stand it when servers keep trying to get you to order more items in order to get a bigger tip. And Giada's servers do just that -- and I see that other reviewers have mentioned this as well.  The server kept pushing us to try their cocktails, and after we kept saying \"no thank you,\" she brought us about half-an-ounce of a lemon ginger beverage that was pleasant, and she said it was compliments of Giada. (I am sure Giada had no idea we were even in the restaurant, but okay.) We enjoyed the sip of the drink she gave us until she came back, again asking if we wanted a cocktail. What part of \"NO\" is so difficult to understand? I finally asked her if they had a non-alcoholic menu, to which she replied, \"we might, but I don't know if the bartenders know how to make those drinks.\" All right then stop asking...  Next, she kept pushing us to try the tasting menu. The thing about the menu that really irked me was that it didn't say how much it was. We'd read other reviews that said it was $125 per person, and while we could afford a $250 dinner, spending that much on one meal is, in our view, immoral. So we weren't interested in it. But the server wouldn't take no for an answer. We kept asking about other items on the menu, but she kept coming back to the tasting menu. We don't want to try it -- stop asking!  The server was annoyed with us because we didn't order cocktails or the tasting menu.   The food was good, but the portions were very small, even compared to other upscale restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the scallop risotto, which was literally a 4 oz. serving (they measure it). My \"rack of lamb\" interestingly was half the size of racks of lamb I order at other restaurants. Which begs the question: why not call it *half* a rack of lamb? :) We have tiny appetites so it wasn't a problem, but I think most people would be disappointed if they paid $100 for two dinner entrees that small.  My girlfriend's risotto was underdone, but she really enjoyed it. The rice was still pretty hard and got stuck in my teeth. I ordered my lamb medium well, but received medium rare. I sent it back, and it came back past the point of being well done, and because it was the second time they were grilling it, it had lost most of its flavorful juices. It was well-seasoned, but a little dry.  After our dinner, the server then started another round of pressure-selling, this time for dessert. When we said we had no room for dessert, she loudly said \"WHAT? who comes to Giada and doesn't try the dessert?\" Um, well it's a new restaurant, so you haven't had enough customers to establish a trend. Another server heard her and asked what was wrong, and she said \"they don't want to try Giada's dessert,\" to which he shook his head and said \"what a shame.\" I know (or I hope) they were joking, but we didn't like it. The tables are so close to each other so a bunch of other people heard this conversation.  When we got the check, there was an iphone attached to it, and when we were looking at their cocktails, their drinks menu was on an ipad. This stuff is nice, but I couldn't help but think that maybe if they cut out some of those expenses and focused a little more on their food and service, the result would be better appreciated by most customers.   Ultimately, we thought we were paying a little more for excellent food by a famous chef. Instead, we got food that was only a little better than average, and it came attached to very aggressive service. The extra money we spent goes to the decor, the fancy electronic gadgets, and the Giada brand name, not the food that Giada is famous for.",

    "text": "It wasn't hard to persuade my boyfriend that we should select Giada for my recent birthday dinner. In fact, he was ecstatic. So ecstatic to the point where if he hadn't planned me the best birthday weekend ever, it'd bother me...just a little...  This 4-star review is one that could easily be a 5-star my next visit. Are first impressions everything? No, but boy do you remember them!  We made reservations via OpenTable for 5:45pm. We checked in at the hostess stand and waited by the entry. A few minutes went by and we watched a handful of hostesses trying to appear organized, while we watched a few more parties check in and wait along with us. No parties were seated. Then, one of the hostesses came and asked again what name our reservations were booked with. She returned to the hostess stand, and we waited. A few minutes later, a different hostess approached us and suggested we order some drinks at the lounge while we wait. Feeling a bit skeptical, but we did just that. We ordered drinks at the lounge, the only available table had empty beer bottles from the previous customers. A manager approached and welcomed us to the restaurant and thanked us for joining them for dinner. Then, he walked away. My thoughts? Anyone? How about seeing to getting tables bussed... or helping the hostesses seat some parties? Before our drinks arrived, a DIFFERENT hostess (yes, there were about 5 of them, at least) informed us that our table was ready and that our drinks can be delivered to our dinner table. She asked, \"Who was your cocktail server?\" My boyfriend and I looked at her blankly, the server didn't introduce herself and we didn't notice if she wore a nametag. The hostess gave us this look like \"What, you don't remember the server you had a 20-second interaction with?!?!\" She walked off without another word, asked around to find out who was our server, then returned to seat us. We finally got to our table at 6:15pm. I understand, maybe 1/2 hour isn't the most horrible wait time, but that whole scenario made it seem forever.   Okay enough, on with the food!  Citrus Marinated Calamari Lobster Arancini Spah-geh-tee Veal Chop Saltimbocca Homemade Gelato  Her spaghetti lives up to the hype, it was amazing! The shrimps underneath the pasta were unbelievable, I think I cut one shrimp into five pieces. The lobster arancini were delicious, but I could've lived without the calamari. I'd probably have gone with the fried version next time. My boyfriend said the veal chop was good, but the portion was too big and a little too much breading for his taste. The gelato? We got two scoops, roasted banana and white coffee w/ chocolate shavings. Yum!  The service at the table? Phenomenal! I can't say one bad word about it. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely without the feeling of being rushed.   I have to say I LOVED the ambiance and decor. Everything from the glass straw for your iced tea, elegant feminine silverware, the fresh pasta noodle display, even her restrooms with hand paper towels with \"Giada\" printed on them just screamed the chef and her classy style. It's a place I'd love to return to have lunch with just the gals.  FYI:   - Make your reservations at OpenTable online. I attempted to change our dinner time via the Cromwell. OpenTable had seatings available that the Cromwell did not offer.  - They offer a dinner tasting menu for $125/person that includes many of the popular items for every course. Full table participation only.  - They charged for our dessert, even though we were celebrating a special occasion. Were we spoiled in expecting that? The gentlemen with the elegant dessert cart did write Happy Birthday on my plate and make me feel special, plus the gelato was incredible!  - Giada herself did not make an appearance that night. Good thing my boyfriend fell into a deep content food coma over the delicious dinner or he'd have been utterly disappointed. Hopefully next time!",

Best part of the meal was the bread and pesto.   I'm sad because I was really looking forward to trying this place. We were just extremely disappointed across the board. Too many amazing options in Vegas to come here, sorry to say.",

    "text": "I love Giada. I have been wanting to try it for a while.  We did not make a reservation because it was lunch and I didn't think we needed one.  We were promptly sent into the punishment room (the bar) for 15 minutes because we didn't have a reservation.  The funny thing was that although 3 parties left during that time no other diners came in during that time.  When we were seated we got to sit by a huge open window near the street corner and we really enjoyed watching the people.  Our waiter was a little nutty but he was nice, he introduced himself and left without taking a drink order or anything else.  When he did return he actually tried to leave again and I had to tell him we were ready to order.  We decided to order a few appetizers and see what happened.  We ordered the Gorgonzola with pear and honey, wow, it was delicious.  We also had the prosciutto with pear and fig mustard.  MMMM.  The caponata was something that I had not had before and it was also very good.  By the time we finished the appetizers we were to full to order a main dish.  It was very good overall and the only reason I didn't give the fifth star was for being punished for not having a reservation.",

While waiting for a table we went to the FREE photo booth and took some pictures. We then forgot seated and orders. We loved the views of the Las Vegas Strip. We were enjoying the wonderful views but then, we were waiting and waiting for our food for an hour and a half. Once we got the food it was so good! I would come back to this restaurant, but also it may be a little pricey and crowded depending on the time, we went on brunch and it was cheaper and less crowded.",

I told them that I had called earlier and they were regretfully already fully committed. I explained that we would wait for the bar, but the man in front led us straight to a table. The service was a slower than I would have expected. It took about 10-15 min before we were greeted or even given menus at our table. They were obviously busy and because we were lucky to get a seat, we let it go. Had we had a reservation, it might have been a different story. We may have actually walked out come to think of it...   Anyways...  The FOOD! Unbelievable! We had the Gorgonzola with raw honey, shrimp spaghetti with lemon and basil, the 28oz. Bone-in Tuscan rib-eye, lobster ravioli and lemon souffle! Everything was just SPECTACULAR! The flavor so wonderful! The rib-eye was a bit too salty but the egg helped mellow it out a bit. I would still HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! It was cooked to perfection. Everything came out hot and was just heavenly! We will for sure be back. I would highly recommend it! Hoping next time we actually have a reservation, the service is running on an even keel with the food!   ENJOY!",

You can see the Bellagio water fountains which is amazing, request a table with a view.  The restaurant is located upstairs at the Cromwell Hotel and Casino. This hotel is brand spanking new, extraordinary clean and sparkly! We walked in to Giada's and it was like we were in Italy. There  were beautiful cases filled with cheeses, olives and meats, a brick oven with breads and pizza's and a bustling fun open kitchen. The ambiance was very invited, warm with gorgeous soft colors.  The dishes were authentic Italian and scrumptious. We shared her chicken cacciatore and it was incredible. I am a super fan of Giada and have been following her for years, this restaurant is incredible. You won't be disappointed!",

Every cook has their special tone and flavor profile and I just don't jive with Giada who I love on TV and at the Garlic Festival she attended last year.  The best charred Octopus I have had ( tried many) was in Pismo Beach at the Oyster Loft - and I have not found an \"excellent\" version since.  Giada was close but way too much of an acid profile - with a little sweetness from mandarin Oranges.  She uses Soux Vide techniques but the Octopus was still a bit rubbery for me and not enough char.  The beauty at Oyster loft is a glazed orange butter marinade during cooking and then various flavors of hot peppers, garlic and acid from blistered cherry tomatoes and the orange.  Anyway, Giada did not match up.",

When we got there, the person asked the couple that just came in before me if they had a reservation and when they said no, were seated immediately.  A party of six then came up and they overlooked me to seat them, again no reservations. So I then finally get asked and tell them we have a reservation. She looks it up and tells me it will be about a 10 minute wait. What???  I go sit down and a few minutes later she comes to get us.  We are seated at one of the worst window tables up against the billing ordering station and directly in the sun. We asked to be moved and it's like a major ordeal. The restaurant wasn't even partly full.  Then we open our cloth napkins and they have clearly been used.  No special service or mention of the birthday although this was noted in the reservation  The food was good and that's why they got the rating they did from me.  C'mon Giada, you need to monitor your namesake restaurant for better service and customer care.",

Yum! Sauteed mushrooms- nice flavor and good assortment  White trout crostini(nice flavor) Bacon wrapped sausage stuffed dates(order these!!!)  Lemon crema spaghetti with shrimp Brussels sprouts(out of sight delicious)  Service was spot on. We had a really fun and knowledgeable waiter, she was very professional and nice.   We also shared a bottle of wine, there was a nice wine list. Check total for 2 was $180, which I thought was reasonable.   In summary, it's a great experience.",

We got a table right up front with view of Bellagio fountain and Caesars palace.    I have the tasting menus and my husband ordered a la cart.  For the tasting menu I was not especially excited about the antipasti, I was a little disappointed but it was still good. However I absolutely love love loved the Salmon cake Benedict. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly. The sour toast was amazing for soaking up all the gooey goodness. Finally the souffle was a perfect ending.   My husband ordered the wood fired mushrooms, which was good, but again nothing special. The lobster roll and arugula salad were yummy and a nice entree.   The wait staff were very attentive and were fast and great when ever we had a special request (lowering the screen to block sun, bring lemon for sparkling water).   They also brought mini Brownies and pastry to munch on. We had so much food and didn't want to fill up on them so we just had a little taste at the restaurant. They bagged them up for us and made great morning snacks in the hotel room.   The one complaint we had was one of the glasses for the water had a bit of an eggy smell. The lemon fixed that, but it was a little annoying.",

Off to a great start, since we've been wanting to try Giada's for some time now.  THE GREAT: the FRITTO MISTO  (fried calamari and shrimp) was the most tender I've had in a restaurant, and the sauce served with it was delicate and complimented the seafood perfectly.  THE DUCK PROSCIUTTO melts in your mouth and comes with two mustards and crisp apple slices...it is amazing around the apple.   THE RISOTTO comes with two seared scallops and is cooked in a creamy seafood sauce, simply delicious.  THE RAVIOLI is stuffed with cheese and topped off with a great meat sauce; I wish I had that recipe!   THE MEDIOCRE: the bacon wrapped dates were good but a little too sweet for my taste ( I know, should've expected it by ordering dates).   The destroyer cocktail was more like an expensive tequila shot than a nice drink, you can't really taste any of the fruit through the tequila.   All in all, a great dinner and a wonderful atmosphere with bey helpful and sweet staff. We will be coming back and definitely getting that fritto misto again!",

The bartenders were rude & did us a favor making our drinks.  The waiter was bizarre, a cross between Lurch from The Addams Family & Marty Feldman's character from Young Frankenstein.  That really wouldn't have bothered me had he been helpful & attentive but he was dismissive & aloof.  The table shared a meager pizzette that was good but way too small. When we ordered it at the bar, it never came.  The bartender blamed us for not telling him which one we wanted but the digital bar menu on iPads just stated Pizzette without explanation.  They finally brought the Pizzette Margarita to the table after we were seated.  My husband & I shared a Cesar salad, when brought I asked if that was the whole order or half because it looked like a three bite salad.  It turned out to be the entire salad & was just ok, nothing special.  My husband ordered the chicken cacciatore which turned out out to be a heavily breaded fried chicken (more bread, little chicken) which was over cooked & almost inedible.  I ordered the vegan eggplant dish which sounded great as described on the menu.  Turned out, the eggplant was chewy due to being under cooked & the flavors were heavy.  Our dinner companions order the branzino which they told us they enjoyed.  Bread & flat bread crackers were good. Dessert menu was lackluster. Giada.....get it together.  Hire wait staff who are actually helpful.  Supervise your kitchen. Maybe then you will have a noteworthy restaurant!",

I just love the way everything was served. The waiter was awesome. We decided not to get unlimited mimosas but it is only $30 if you decide. Our meals each were $45 and its great cause you get the starters, meal, and dessert. The lemon raspberry macaroons are so delicious and so was the chocolate Eiffel Tower. The place is so fancy but affordable. Another great thing I loved is that there is a photo booth in waiting area and you get free photos!!!!!!! Loved it! Will definitely be returning my next visit!",

Amazing service (after a very short debacle with our reservations that was quickly resolved); fair prices; terrific, fresh ingredients; great view and location and overall a beautiful restaurant.   Not sure why this restaurant is getting so much hate from people because \"Giada isn't a real chef\" - who cares? How often do you go to an amazing restaurant NOT owned by a chef? A LOT. She's a hell of a business woman that employs amazing chefs, cooks and restaurant managers. You think Mario Batali is the one cooking your steak at Carnevino? Riiight...",

First, they have a fun complimentary photo booth for customers waiting or after a meal. Such a great concept!   Second, the staff at Giada is pure quality. They take care of you while making you feel respected. They are so polite it's unreal.   Lastly, the food is so delectable. Most of the time when going into fancy restaurants you don't expect much from the food because it's just supposed to be good. Giada really tastes like home. The recipes,  tastes, and flavors that go into making this delicious food is quality.   If you're looking for a quality experience that will remind you of home, Giada is a must!",

We were starting out the New Year with the Ol' eat healthy, but slipped in the drinking department.  We had the beet salad, very fresh and light, the brussel sprout crostini, good but not amazing. Also enjoyed the Giardiniera (marinated pickled vegetables and olives).  The place was pretty busy and like all restaurants in a hotel on the strip, expect a bit pricey.  I'd go again and hang out at the bar and grab a bite, but not sure if I would want to do a proper sit down dinner there.  It is a little over hyped.",

    "text": "Let me preface by saying I'm a huge fan.  She's really the only chef/FN star I've followed and  made many recipes from, so naturally was eagerly anticipating her restaurant opening.   First visit was one year ago (party of 2).  We were seated at bar even though we had reservations.  No problem.  Ordered a signature cocktail which was delicious and was seated a short time later.  The waitress explained the menu a bit and suggested we order \"at least 3 or more plates\", as we were thoroughly made aware each dish was for 1-2 people.  I had caught a glimpse of the dessert cart upon arrival and wanted to be sure to save room for some.  But since the waitress was insistent we order said number of plates, we obliged.  The food was good, however, as expected, I was near full and decided to pass on dessert.  Oh well, next time!  Second visit:  party of 6.  My daughter wanted to go for her bday, since she heard I'd enjoyed it the first time.  I made reservations (forgetting to request a window view, darn) and tried to recall the menu to accommodate for 3x as many people.  Entire party were family members, already knowing their palate and also knowing none of us were 'starving' and it being a later dinner (8pm) - I figured we'd order more plates than on my first visit and all would be 'okay'.  Wrong!  When our waiter arrived I immediately informed him I'd dined before but the rest of my party had not, and if he could refresh my memory and/or make suggestions.  He began to rattle off so much stuff, saying something about the menu changing from my previous visit... and now dessert was only offered with the....who knows what he said...basically he ended on the mention of their...I'll call it 'prix-fixe menu'.  At $120 a head! Uhhh...I was unprepared.  And now, totally confused!  As previously mentioned, none of us in the party were that hungry, especially for some of the items he'd mentioned....like lamb (yuck).  And since I was picking up the tab, I also wasn't prepared for that heft of a bill.  To make a long story short, he walked away, leaving us to quickly decide what we wanted.  It was obvious he was expecting that we go with his suggestion above and instead, we ordered  what WE wanted to eat - several appetizers, a couple salads and pasta dishes.  He seemed annoyed with us, saying it wouldn't be enough food, shrugged his shoulders several times and pretty much set the tone for the rest of our meal (can you say 'awkward'?)   I guess it wasn't obvious on my first visit that they really try to SELL each and every dish and drink at Giada's.  After this second visit, not sure I'll return.  The food is good, don't get me wrong, but unless $$$$ (and yes, you should really change that to 4 instead of 3) is no object to spend for a larger party, I suggest trying it as a party of 2 (if you're a really big fan and must fulfill your bucket list). Oh, and for my daughter's bday, they brought out a large platter with 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate (3/4 of the plate) with 2 small cookies on the remaining quarter.  It was too embarrasing to take a photo of, so we didn't :/",

    "text": "I dined at Giada's on Aug. 9th by myself and on Aug, 12th with my BFF who flew in from Nashville for the weekend. I am not a Giada fangirl but the menu and photos of the restaurant made it one of my must try in LV. On my first visit I sat at the bar and was lucky enough to have Katy as my server. I was a little overwhelmed because the restaurant was gorgeous and there were so many items on the menu I wanted to try. I started with a lovely glass of Prosecco and started with the Fritto Misto while I decided on dinner. I've read other reviews about the Fritto Misto and agreed: not very good. Seafood was ok but no flavor to breading or the aioli... disappointing. For dinner I decided on the Risotto with crab and scallops based on the recommendation from the gentleman sitting next to me...he ate the whole dish and said it was delish! I enjoyed it as well, although I prefer my scallops with a hard sear but that's just a personal preference. No room for desert! Second visit with my BFF, we had table reservations but went early and sat at the bar for a drink. My BFF went with my suggestion to forgo the table and to have dinner with Katy and Bo at the bar...we loved it! We chose the tasting menu and an appetizer to share since we wanted to try so many dishes. We started with the bruschetta with burrata, balsamic strawberry reduction and avocado. It was delicious! The bread service with dinner is one of the best I've ever had (and I was in the restaurant business for most of my life) with 2 types of breads and 5 garnish options. From the Tasting Menu: we enjoyed all the appetizers but the steak bruschetta was our least favorite offering. Second course we opted for the Bucatini with regular Pomodoro instead of spicy because my BFF doesn't like spicy. It was delicious but I would definitely try it spicy next time. Next course was the Filet Mignon with crispy polenta, lemon smashed potatoes and corn stuffing. The filet was cooked beautifully and we were having trouble finishing everything but it was so delicious we kept eating! Then came desert god Josh with a bowl containing one serving each of: peach Bellini sorbet, white coffee, and chocolate gelato. We loved every flavor but the white coffee was my fave. Then Josh came around with the dessert cart: While making each other laugh I choose the fudge bar, then he said \"What else?\" I gave my friend the next pick but Josh said to me,\"You're not hearing me..what else do you want???\" I seriously couldn't believe him but chose the raspberry chocolate cake. Then Josh turns to my BFF and asks her the same thing: she choose the raspberry tiramisu and the lemon mousse tart. I am a tiramisu connoisseur and hate when people mess with the recipe but I have to say...this raspberry tiramisu was spot on! Tasty, light, and creamy. We finished the ice cream bowl but had to bring the rest of the desserts back to the hotel. When I asked Bo for take out utensils he searched high and low for them but they were not to be found. No problem we said...then we were halfway down the escalator then Bo was suddenly behind us with take out utensils he was able to find. What a gentleman! So will I visit this restaurant again? Definitely... and I would give 6 stars for Katy and Bo's service alone!",

We initially got seated in the back by the bar but we asked the hostess to move us by the window and she did.   The wait time was a little long but I think it's because the place is crazy busy. It did take us awhile to get some bread.   We ordered some wine and the mozzarella to start. It was delicious! The appetizer menu is huge so there are a lot of options. My husband ordered the surf and turf and he says it's one of the best things he's ever eaten. I ordered the risotto with the scallops. The risotto was a bit too buttery for me but if you like your risotto creamy and buttery you will like it. The scallops were cooked just right though, seared on the outside but soft when you cut into it. Perfect! The crab inside the risotto was very flavorful but not too overpowering. I would definitely recommend it.   We would eat here again and I recommend this place but make a reservation! Also, order some appetizers because there are wonderful options and the main dishes are not very big so you will not get stuffed.   Enjoy!",

The fruit is stunningly fresh. My husband got a traditional breakfast with outstanding potatoes (it was the only thing I could snag before he devoured his entire breakfast). The hours start at 8am at the bar, 9am dining room. Excellent service with Molly at the bar. This is a total rewards property, don't forget to show your card and get points!",

    "text": "I expected quite a bit more from a restaurant that has Giada's name on it. Our server made us feel more like an inconvenience rather than a guest.  He made no suggestions and was no help at all when it came to the menu or what we should order. The bread dish that they served had little dishes with condiments in them and they were all cracked and chipped.  They were out of the one dish my husband wanted to try, the lobster ravioli, and it was early in the night. The food was so-so, appetizers were good but the Veal Saltimbocca was just a large veal chop put on a plate that was brown, mushy and very unappetizing.  The plate had nothing else on it, no garnish, nothing. We left very unfulfilled and will never recommend or try any of her restaurantsin the future.",

    "text": "I had heard that Giada De Laurentiis, the famous cooking TV personality, had opened a restaurant at The Cromwell and was mildly interested.  Then, when an article appeared in the Parade Magazine and both my mother and my sister became overly curious, I made a reservation.  And finally, weeks later, it was my turn to experience the divine.  We went in thinking we would get a few things and share.  Soon we were ordering the tasting menu and wine pairing complete with an autographed photo, souvenir menu and recipe cards.  I guess you could say we were \"all in,\" in poker parlance.  We began with the Antipasti:  Bacon Wrapped Dates (with spicy Italian sausage  gorgonzola crema), Vitello Tonanato (veal loin, seared tuna, caper aioli), and Baby Sweet Peppers (with goat cheese and olive tapenade).  Second:  Pasta (Rigatoni with vegetable Bolognese).  Third:  Salmon (pan roasted with summer succotash & whole grain mustard).  Dessert:  Banana ice cream, Chocolate ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, etc.--the nice man brought the cart and I wanted some of everything!  And he was a willing co-conspirator.   The dining room is absolutely LOVELY -- fantastic in every way, maybe the best dining room in Las Vegas, and that is saying something.  Added to that, it sits kitty corner to the Bellagio and the dancing waters, which are magical to watch.  The table was a tad small.  A good thing for conversation but a bad thing for all the food and wine we ordered; we averaged three glasses of wine each on the table at any one time. Service was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. The whole time we felt like guests who were welcome to stay all night. The service was spectacular and the Manager went out of his way to greet every single customer.  The first salmon they brought me was stinky and overcooked.  They whisked it away and brought me another that was positively wonderful.  The wine-lady, Theresa did a good job, up until the point where she paired a $5 Nero d'Avala with the Salmon -- a total no-no.   Otherwise, her pairings were classic, just what you'd find if you consulted one of those phone apps.  The coffee was strong, but of good quality.  Seems that all these restaurants serve something called an Americano--espresso with some hot water added -- the stuff will stop your heart, after it races away.   All-in-all the experience was outstanding -- Andrew and Nick did a great job of keeping it all well-paced and us well-fed and well-attended to.  At the end of the meal they give you a mini-ipad with your bill to fill out a survey, I think that is a bad idea because the time that it takes to do the survey could be used to turn the table over and get the waiting guests inside.  This is the kind of place that you want to go to at 5pm, if your reservation is for anytime after 7 you WILL WAIT! I have seen a lot of very critical reviewing of this place out there in cyberspace and in print.  I get some of it, but I think a lot of it is just unfair.  If you want spaghetti and meatballs, this is NOT the place to go.  But if you want a meal of well thought out quality food, cooked perfectly and FOR YOU, then this is a very worthy place.  Good for you Giada I wish you well!  At $550 for two, out the door, I don't think I'll be back soon, unless I can find a sponsor!",

Bar service needs a heads up. I had a sitting space at the bar corner because the restaurant was booked, so the hostess offer me this option and I said it was ok. But I had to ask for menu, wine list, water, dessert menu, etc... Bar tenders were never rough, but they have to work on a better personalized experience. Max, who brought me the bread, was outstanding and very thorough in his speech. He certainly set the mood for the rest of my stay there. Overall experience was very good.",

    "text": "We were super excited to try this place and went without a reservation at about 11:30am.  The polite hostesses told us to come back in about a half an hour, which was no problem - I assumed the restaurant would be crowded and busy, as it just opened.  When we returned, we waited a little longer, then were seated near the bar.  The restaurant has an amazing view of the strip, but we couldn't see anything from our table.  The restaurant was about half empty, leading me to believe this was more of a soft open - I know they haven't been open for lunch long.  Service was very friendly.  I had the Prosecco sangria, which was delicious, and we had some fantastic chicken meatballs.  The bread they brought out at the beginning of the meal was absolutely wonderful, though a bit greasy. I was very disappointed to see that there was only one pasta dish on the menu for lunch - I thought for sure Giada was famous for her delicious pasta dishes!  I couldn't order the baked pasta, as it contains pork, so I went for the lemon pesto grilled cheese, served with spiralized zucchini and potatoes.  It was quite good, but it took a really, really long time to come out.  Like, probably 40 minutes.  It's a grilled cheese!  We were getting pretty antsy - not to mention hungry - and we prefer spending our time wandering around Vegas, not sitting in a booth.  My husband ordered the muffeletta sandwich, a wedge of bread with various cured meats.  We later realized this sandwich is premade and is sitting with the antipasto items in the front deli case area.  Why did it take 40 minutes to put a premade sandwich on a plate with salad?  He found the bread somewhat soggy, likely because it's premade.  It didn't take long after we left the restaurant for my husband to start to feel ill and nauseous; he ended up out of commission the rest of the day.  I'm not sure how long the sandwiches were sitting in the case, but it might have been just a touch too long.  He had not eaten anything else that day save a banana, and he hadn't had anything to drink but water.  The wait staff was very kind and attentive every step of the way.  However, it appears that they just haven't worked out lunch yet.  I would not return.",

    "text": "Visiting Giada's restaurant was high on my list for my first Vegas trip.  Traveling by wheelchair, I was initially thwarted from the goal because floor level entry through the casino was by steps.  A tip from my hotel's bellhop sent me up the valet entrance where access was possible.  The restaurant was beautifully appointed and welcoming.  The views of the area out the big windows was spectacular (Bellagio fountains, Caesars).  A romantic and classy spot.  The windows were open but had to be closed due to windy conditions for those sitting near them.  (The bathroom was lovely, too!)  There was a high traffic volume for the restaurant making the seating and serving impersonal and infrequent.  There was some large party noise keeping this from being a peaceful retreat.  Menu looked yummy.  I chose a summer minestrone soup and a caponata for a light lunch.  The minestrone was divine--perfectly diced and equally sized veggies in a meat broth with a touch of parmesan melted as an accent.  Well-balanced flavors.  Sadly, the $10 soup was far less than a cup and gone quickly.  I guess you pay for the chef's name and not food volume.   The waitress described the caponata as a rough-cut hummus.  It was actually a rough cut eggplant with other little goodies like pine nuts and raisins.  It was good but served with only 3 small toast points.  There was plenty of the caponata left which I ate with a spoon.  I think Giada could've spared 2 more toast points (they called it \"lavash\") on this small tasting dish of $9.    While others had dainty desserts, I was never offered a dessert menu and left without.   While I deem the ambiance 5-star (my favorite location in all of Vegas) and the flavors 5-star, I left feeling a little jipped in service and still hungry after $24 of food/tip.  I would certainly go back for a second experience with her food and perhaps some meatier options on the menu.",

Wish I would of taken pics to compare what we were served on a few days ago.   Things have changed here. Not for the better. Now its become a tourist trap. The lobster rolls use to be huge here. I'm talking 'OMG that is all for me, pearl clutching, watch me inhale this sucker', kind of huge. What I was served the other day was half the size, regular white bread instead of brioch (sp). And they jacked the price up $6.00 to $35.00!   We were so disappointed in what the place has become we never got dessert. And we won't go back. Business takes us to the strip about once a week. We eat often down there. There are so many great places that like locals, it just became a little easier where not to go.",

    "text": "First, let me say that the bacon-wrapped, sausage-stuffed dates were one of the best things I have ever tasted state-side. Also, all of the staff greeted us when passing when we arrived, walked around, and left.  However: 1. This is the first time I had to use a knife to cut shrimp. The texture was very rubbery as if it were not fully cooked through. I love shrimp, but I couldn't stomach it. 2. The photo booth was not printing out photos for some reason. The response of the hostess was, \"It's out of ink. You can use the email photo.\" Then she walked away. She said this to us and one other couple. She didn't offer to change the ink or inform us that she couldn't change the ink. No solution offered. It would have been a nice souvenir for my girlfriend and I. And the camera had something wrong with it - the photo we did email has a big frosty blur, as if there was a smudge on the lens. 3. The server was very friendly, but I think that he was trying too hard. He seemed more concern with getting positive feedback for the restaurant that being sincerely friendly and helpful. 4. The desserts...left much to be desired.  Giada, I think you're awesome and we were so looking forward to visiting, so I was very sad to have a less than stellar experience at your restaurant while in Vegas. :(",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with some commentary on a local \"critic's\", well, I guess, \"pre-emptive\" review in which he basically denounced all things Giada, pretty much predicated on her fame. I'd suggest the real motive behind it is her fame and his lack thereof, at least beyond the usual, incestual, self-aggrandizing LV \"foodie\" circles. My guess is he got to meet her (probably about three bottles into an early afternoon, knowing him) at any one of a half dozen food/ wine bacchanals across the U.S. and failed to impress her with his LV notoriety.  On to the subject at hand- the eponymous Giada at the re-opened and renovated Cromwell (formerly Bills, nee The Barbary Coast). While my not-so-esteemed hobby-critic non-professional is correct in his observance that the very affable Ms. de Laurentiis has never operated a restaurant, she does have a very real passion for food that her experience on the Food Network has translated into a somewhat new breed of culinary experience. As for how that translates into a commercial culinary operation, well, based on my experience, she's got the bulk of it figured out. Back to that later...  As far as the experience went, the room's very much like its namesake- beautiful, but not in the glamorous sense that pervades all things Vegas, more along the lines of the girl-next-door. Bright and airy, with clean lines, uncluttered space, and sparing us of overly-retro/ ironic furnishings and paint schemes, it's simply a breath of fresh air. The only knock here is the hokey \"tour\" of the counter space that fronts the open space of the kitchen. Better to let waiting guests explore on their own and have friendly staff ask them if they have any questions with an appropriate table-side follow up, which, based on the service I received, would be proficiently, if not charmingly, executed.  Beverage-wise (and all great meals' first course, IS a beverage, preferably somewhat strong drink), this place is in very capable mixological hands. My table sampled several of the cocktails which covered a broad spectrum of tastes and ingredients. Well-balanced and elegantly presented, they formed a great flavor canopy under which we stretched out, relaxed, and perused the bill of fare. Which, with much confidence, our server, whose name has, for the moment escaped me, handled ably as my dining companion proceeded to order from both sides of the menu (the left side being more small plate/ anti-pasti driven, while the right side features larger, heartier dishes), in the manner of a SWAT officer range-testing a new automatic weapon. As we awaited the various plates arrival, our sommelier approached. I informed her of the myriad and sundry plates on their way from the kitchen, and when she asked, \"Do you want to go red or white?\" , my response, hedonist that I wish I to be,  was, both.  As dishes arrived and were placed upon the table family style with well-enunciated descriptions, she returned with both, and they were perfect. A medium-light bodied white and similar red with bright acidity to keep flavors flowing and the flavors did just that- flowed deliciously. This is fresh, just off the garden style cooking, reminiscent of backyard-dining at family gatherings. Except this was Italian, unlike my family's tendency to flame-roasted flesh, potatoes, and fresh peas, regardless of season. Well, maybe the fresh peas regarded the season...  Anyway, from the charred octupus to arancini, the flavors were bright and straight-forward. The only miss was a soup that I'm quite sure had been the result of an improperly followed recipe. Call it the vulnerable moment that endeared me as I was happily overwhelmed by layers of excellence.  As the large plates arrived, I again beckoned the sommelier and asked her help along the same criteria, albeit with some bolder flavors and richer options, none of which missed the mark. I might add, she accomplished all of this with by-the-glass offerings. An aside- here's the True mark of a wine program- you should find every pairing you need for everything on the menu on their BTG list. It's really not all that hard. Anyway, the star of all those plates, and by \"star\" I mean Alpha Centauri compared to Vega, was the Lemon Spaghetti. Perfectly cooked, perfect texture, perfectly balanced, it resulted in much discussion at our table about our own recipes for such and a \"throw-down\" challenge, of which I am a part. I look forward to repeated research outings here...  Dessert too, was comfortable, fresh, and uncomplicated- a selection of great gelatos and some amazing chocolate cookies rounded it all out.  Which brings me back to my point about this being Ms. de Laurentiis' first go- it's all about passion and professionalism, only one of which can be learned, but both can be hired. This place is in very capable hands...",

Made us wait for 10-12 minutes in the front when there were many tables available. Waiter was friendly and helpful, a bit slow with service. Decor lovely, great view of strip if the shades are raised but at 4:30 they would not raise the shades claiming the sun or reflection would be too bright. We were there almost 2 hrs, no reflection or bright sun ever appeared (we could see under the mostly lowered shades) so no unobstructed view was ever made available.  Great selection of wines and interesting cocktail selections. Very good glasses of wine available in several styles. Now the bad news: the food. Restaurant had just opened for dinner and they were out of the grilled artichoke, which the waiter did not even know about until he turned in our order. How can you be out a dish on the permanent menu when you just open and the staff doesn't even know about it? Stuffed dates were dry, no sauce, 1st time in my 33 yrs of marriage my wife didn't love them! Salads were okay at best, pasta with vegetarian ragu was excellent, salmon okay, lemon shrimp pasta was 2 shrimp in house made spaghetti with a light lemon flavor. Not bad but for $26 way overpriced and only 2 shrimp. Not the knockout signature dish we were expecting or hoped for.  Lemon smashed potatoes were okay but would have been better had they been hot when served. Cheese plate nothing special. We are huge Giada fans and made 2 reservations here months in advance for our stay in Vegas, cancelled the 2nd after this meal.  Highlight of the meal: Limoncello souffle, we would come back for that dish alone. See my review on the best Italian meal we had at Mario Battali's place in the Venetian B&B Ristorante.",

It's a beautiful restaurant and the food is pretty too.    We ordered a bunch of appetizers including proscuitto and the tricolor salad which were both very yummy.  We had also ordered a pizzette but it never came.  Apparently the kitchen lost our ticket, but we were getting too full to eat a pizza, so we didn't want it anyway.  The server handled it very well, apologizing to us for the mix-up, and was gracious enough to comp our dessert.  I ordered her signature cocktail, and I wasn't too into that either.  I'm not a drinker, so I'm not the person to ask for drink recommendations, but to me it was too strong and it reminded me of some type of cleaning fluid.  But doesn't all alcohol...?  I wasn't super impressed with the lobster ravioli or the rack of lamb.  There was no cheese in the ravioli! I'm not big on cheese either, but I think my husband assessed it fairly well when he said \"It's like... a Chinese dumpling.  There's meat and juices wrapped in dough, but it's missing the part that makes it Italian.\"  As for the lamb, it was okay, but I think it could be less chewy.  For dessert, we had the little cheesecake with a blood orange sliver on top and the lemon cookie, chocolate chip cookie, and the chocolate brownie cookie.  The desserts were yummy indeed.  The man presenting the desserts, however, was a bit too honest when we asked him for his recommendation.  Here's how it went:  Us: Which one do you like? Man: Honestly? Nothing. After 8 months working here, nothing is good to me.  OOOOOOOK.  That guy should not be working there.  Although it was 11pm by the time we were ready for dessert, I wasn't expecting any of the staff to blatantly dissuade us from ordering anything.  But eh.  I still think the dessert was terrific.  Anyways.  Minus one star for the sad entrees, but I had a good time~!",

    "text": "I really loved this restaurant.  It is beautifully decorated and the open air space on the strip was superb.  We had a reservation and were given a great table for lunch on good Friday.  I was excited to try this restaurant as I love Giada.  Hubby and I started by sharing the meatballs.  I gave them an 8.5, hubby a 7 (he felt they were a little drier than he would have liked and lacked browning).  Next we shared the margheritta pizza.  This we both gave a 9.  Excellent crust, cheese and the tomatoes were to die for.  Appeared to be sun dried in marinade and so yummy.  Unfortunately lunch had a turn for the worst, while eating alarms stared going off.  No one explained what was going on and all the guest were unsure if we should evacuate.  Finally they stopped and the dining area became very smokey.  I went and found someone to ask fearing a bit for our safety.  Apparently there was some type of water leak in the kitchen and the kitchen was being shut down.  The ventilators weren't working so all the smoke was billowing into the dining room.  Of course this can't be helped, but we were unable to order anything from the kitchen.  Which was disappointing as I was looking forward to trying a dessert.  The smoke was burning my eyes so I was ready to get out of there.  This is where my review goes from 5 stars to 3 stars.  We were not offered any type of compensation for this.  Our lunch was filled with smoke, alarms and disruption.  Had something been comped for our troubles, or perhaps a complimentary sorbet, I would feel differently.   I am torn about whether I would go back, while I loved the space and felt the food was really good and a great value for lunch prices, I am not impressed with management that would handle the dining crisis by charging diners full price for an alarm smoke filled partial meal.  Side note, iced tea 6 dollars for one small glass.  I would not order that again.  Perhaps a refill was possible, but our waitress was very inattentive, but benefit of the doubt because there was a lot going on.",

    "text": "Well I wanted to give the restaurant 5 stars but no can do. We had a reservation Saturday night 1/26 and we were seated pretty quickly. The restaurant itself has a really nice atmosphere. It is cozy, with  a very classy vibe there. I hope that Giada or the investors read the reviews here as it is important. Wine list is nice but bottles are pricey. Some nice signature cocktails on an iPad that they call an interactive menu. Enter our server Joseph. He had very nice energy and a big smile and was very friendly.  Bread came and it was delicious. Had condiments to go with it. A lemon butter, Calabrian chili, maldon salt & deep fried capers. First issue of the night, LOTS of bread and a TABLESPOON of lemon butter! This was the first skimp of the evening. If you are bringing that much bread then bering more butter. So we ordered Fritto Misto for an appetizer which is deep fried calamari and shrimp with a lemon aioli. The seafood was crispy but needed salt badly. We had to salt it. The aioli was delicious however a \"smear\" of it on the plate equaling maybe 1 tablespoon is not enough aioli period. I kept trying to get Joseph's attention but I couldn't. He was talking to another co-worker and didn't look up. By the time he came over we were pretty much ready for our entrees. We couldn't finish the appetizer because there wasn't anything to dip it in! While we were sitting at our table another couple was seated next to us. Their server kept standing between our table and theirs and his BUTT kept banging into our bread and condiments! This was repeatedly!! The servers have zero manners. His butt was literally a half inch from our table. Their was more room on the other side of the table but he kept disturbing us!  We both ordered the bucatini with tomato, Calabrian chili and fresh ricotta. I'm Italian, half Calabrian. I know Calabrian chili is hot, however when there is so much in the pasta you can barely eat it then we have a problem. In addition there was literally a 1/2 TEASPOON of ricotta on top!! A half teaspoon!! At least put a tablespoon on the pasta to cut the hot chili!! Talk about skimpy! My husband had a teaspoon on his pasta! No parmesan on pasta which I figured was because of the ricotta! Just could barely find the ricotta! I tried to get Joseph's attention but I couldn't! I was waving my arms trying to call his name....jeez. He finally came over and asked me if it was too hot. I said yes! He said you want some plain tomato to add to it! I said no! I honestly wanted to say how about another order made properly but I didn't. Just was over it. We had toasted marshmallow gelato for dessert which was the best thing we ate! We needed it to put the fire out in our mouths! Meanwhile, other server's butt against our table. The service was good and atmosphere really nice. I was disappointed in the food as the skimping on key components of each dish is NOT what a high end restaurant should do. Shouldn't have to ask for more aioli, more butter or ask where the ricotta is! Prices are moderate but not inexpensive. Wish it had been better.",

Our waiters were Jesse and Christian and they did such an amazing job attending to us along with all their other tables. Everyone was smiling and having a great time and enjoying the food. The manager who was there the night we went was John and he was sooo friendly. He came and talked with us for a few minutes asking us what brought us to the restaurant and telling us a few things about himself. He gave his card as well so that we can send him an email that he would forward to Giada herself! I look forward to coming back the next time i'm in town and trying more dishes :)",

Me too, except I thought it was just a bit pricey.   June 2018.  Now it is a dinner place, catering to an adult palette.  My daughter and her friend were the only ones there under 30.  Had a very difficult time reading a menu with  silver writing on white paper in 8pt font, but eventually we took pictures of the menu and enlarged it to read.   My daughter wanted spaghetti, but I knew that she wouldn't like the one on the menu.  Happily, our server was able to make one with red sauce and meatballs.  Also ordered the burrata and bruschetta.  For me, I got the risotto.   Bread came first, everyone loved it.  Next the burrata - the tomatoes were good, the cheese flavorless.  Bruschetta came next.  It was toast with cheese, tomatoes, guacamole and balsamic.  Odd and not very good.   After a long wait, dinner arrived.  The spaghetti and meatballs were as I had pictured, but for me the sauce was bland.  My risotto had plenty of flavor, but the scallops needed more of a sear and the risotto was very al dente, and I mean really al dente. Service was good, still like the restaurant space and it was full.  So, she has a good thing going.  Unfortunately, the changes over the last 3 years were not good ones for us.  We will always remember the older version and wish her success but, we will be looking for a new Italian restaurant.  Sad days.",

As we were waiting to be seated a man and his wife were seated before us and he loudly said \"Don't put me near them I don't want to hear that\". The hostess said nothing and laughed. We were seated by a window overlooking the strip which was lovely, although the open air dining had a nice view I could have gotten it from a McDonald's on the strip and saved $250. The service was poor, rushed, and very basic. Refills were extremely slow and the menu was not explained to us at all. I ordered a small \"pizette\" and it was room temperature and watery. Everyone's meal was about $20+ a plate and all somewhat cold and bland. The WORST part of the experience was walking through the Cromwell my husband walked over to a slot and immediately a manager and security guard power walked to me and in a RUDE and STERN voice told me \"YOU NEED TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY OR IT WILL BE A $10,000 FINE\". I was holding my baby in the middle of walkway, which I didn't know was such a large fine. I would have been happy to move along if I had known but her tone, attitude, and her standing in front of my and the security guard going behind my back for her to yell at me on the casino floor was one of the worst experiences of my life. Sorry Giada, you choose this Casino for your restaurant. In summary I will never eat at Giada again, visit the Cromwell again, or watch any of Giada shows again. Please save your money and stay away from this TV chef \"restaurant\".",

After I sat down, took 5 mins to get water and then another 5 mins for my waiter to come who just dropped off a bunch of menus and said he will be back. When he did come back he was like \"so basically we have pizza pastas and a prefixed menu\" and then walked away. After I got my food I was hoping my waiter would come back so I could get some pepper, however he didn't check back in until my meal was complete.   Regarding the actual food, I think it was good--nothing that blows your mind, but I was satisfied with the taste and portions. Overpriced, but everything in Vegas is so you can't really complain about that.   Would I come here again? Probably not. Do I recommend it, sure, if you are in the area and are in the mood for Italian and have no other better option.",

    "text": "There's a lot of good and a lot of 'wat,' when it comes to Giada. The biggest bias I think anyone here is going to push is that this is the first restaurant for a Food Network chef...and while most of them are fantastic chefs...when it comes to Vegas, you got Joel Robuchon and Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (maybe Guy Savoy...and Ramsey, but his flagship is London...)  Giada...by a fair margin, has the coolest looking restaurant I've been to in Vegas. Great decoration, great location...I mean, the view is killer. Go Cromwell for making this place happen.   The service was like...an awkward first date. Here me out here; they meant well, they were doing good for the most part, but they interjected at weird times to tell us about the menu while insisting there was no rush. I asked for water and the guy gave me a half glass (of what is essentially a lowball glass to begin with) and walked away after I asked for more :I. I got nothing.   Still, it was overall good service.   Dinner...we just sorta ordered whatever. Our server successfully upsold a cheese plate for us that turned out to be on the money (good on him), and he also suggested a pork shoulder ragu pasta that turned out to be quite good. We also did the ricotta crostini (really good) and a flatbread.  Now, all of these were good....but the portions were so spectacularly small that it was like going to a dinner party with models. No one got to eat shit, we just got to taste it. And hey, $  Main courses came out, I did a caprese to start with the short rib. Let me say that they caprese's mozzarella was the best mozz I've ever had in the US. Like, damn. Daaammmnnnn.   The short rib was also the best I've had, and I always opt for a short rib at any restaurant that offers it. It wasn't as completely tender as described (falls apart by touch...more like cuts with fork after some prodding), but it was still freaking amazingly savory. The polenta and accompanying veggies were a plus.   Edit: TOTALLY FORGOT. Holy shit those cookies are good. Buy them. The espresso tower was frozen solid, but dem cookies man...dem cookies.   Overall, damn good food and decent service. Wish there could have been more to eat.",

It definitely feels like Giada had a vision for this restaurant and had a large hand in making it extremely beautiful to look at.   On to the bad. Small portions. Everyday food, nothing special, exorbitant cocktail prices...I could go on. Service was pretentious. Our group was half from NYC and half from SF, so we know good food and service.  I agree with other reviewers that my favorite thing was the orzo meatballs. They were flavorful and moist. We ordered many of the other items and they were mediocre- pizzas, panino, tenderloin sliders, lobster roll, baked pasta etc.,none worth the price.  The kicker was that it was my 30th birthday. Our group had a large bill well over $1,000. As my gratis birthday dessert they brought over their 6 cookie plate... For 10 people! Would it have broken Giada's bank to scrounge for one more plate of cookies. If someone decides to spend their birthday and their paycheck with you, show a little love. That is all.",

There were literally 2 actual breakfast types foods on the menu...it was 90% lunch. It was 9am when we rolled in, so sorry not really brunch time. My stepdad is a diamond member and they said it was a 10 min wait. Diamond members usually don't wait. There were plenty of open tables and the one we sat at was empty the whole time. Not a soul left the restaurant since we had arrived. That was a bunch of BS  The hostess couldn't count. We said we had 4 adults and 2 kids and she said \"ok so 7 then?\" So the restaurant only hires pretty faces. There's no brains upstairs. The menu was just too fancy. We wanted breakfast, not some pretentious lobster hash crap.  Maybe that kind of food suits you and that's fine, but I was not impressed with the service whatsoever.",

She steered us to some choices on the menu to ensure we got a great sampling of Giada's food (\"you gotta try the ravioli).  She checked in, made sure we were doing well, and took the time to get to know us a bit.  It's always a joy to get a server like Lauren.  We watched her as she worked her section....taking time with each party.    Well Done.  Giada (or at least the GM), take note...you've got a real winner in Lauren (and Nate's not too bad either!).

For my Bachelorette party, Giada's felt like the perfect restaurant for a large party.    Upon arriving at the restaurant which is located upstairs, we were promptly escorted to our private room.  The GM could see we were celebrating and sent us sparkling wine complimentary.  What a great gesture to start off our night.    As we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive,  our server explained the menu.  We aren't heavy eaters so our group decided on 2 plates of appetizers to share and we each got an entree.  I got the risotto which was cooked perfectly and the perfect portion size for me.  Can't go out to the club being overstuffed and bloated!  Friends got salmon, surf and turf and pasta dishes.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes.  Lots of reviewers have complained about large prices and small portions.  This is Vegas people!    We also had the pleasure of trying the dessert cart and it was quite delicious from the cookies, sorbet, gelato to cakes, everything was quite unique.  What a wonderful place to celebrate! On the way out each staff member greeted us. Don't forget the photo booth.  Love the experience!",

The food is just ok, but there is no way Italian food should be priced this high.  You are paying for the name \"Giada\".  On top of the cost of the food, we were mis guided by our waiter in suggesting a wine that we though was $50 a bottle and when we got the bill, it was $150.  Be sure you know what you are buying here.  They will run your bill up in a hurry if you are not watching.  The service was just ok as well. This place was the highest cost restaurant we ever ate at and it was far from something you would want to pay around $500 for just one couple for dinner with tip.  We just felt ripped off!  Seriously for a famous chef, walk across the street to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  Yes, it is not Italian food, but Bobby does not gouge you in the cost of his food and it is awesome!     Save your money and go elsewhere.  So many options in Vegas, and no need to put this place on your list. If you want good Italian at a reasonable price go right around the corner about 2 blocks, to Battista's Hole In the Wall.  It sure is a hole in the wall, but they have great Italian food for a good price.",

We started dinner with ordering a bottle of champaigne to celebrate our anniversary.  After our first glass, we had to serve ourselves, which usually isn't an issue, except for it seemed like the only time we saw our server was to give us that, and then take our order for apps and dinner.  They never asked us if we wanted more to drink and we had to go get our check.  The Manager also offered us a glass of Prosecco as well, but again, we just decided to leave.

I didn't get to read the menu fast enough but they recommended it. The orzo meatballs were straight up meatballs. No oomph. The big salad thing everyone is talking about was good, kinda salty but nothing great. The mushroom pizza was pretty good. Very strong cheese.

    "text": "I'm a little torn about this one folks.  I've always enjoyed watching Giada De Laurentiis' shows on Food Network so I couldn't be anymore happier when the chef decided to have her first ever restaurant in Las Vegas.  Too bad celebrity chef restaurants usually don't live up to the hype due to such high expectations and sadly, this one's no exception.  The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance. Despite of the tables being so close to each other, details throughout made it feel as if we were dining at home so it wasn't too awkward/uncomfortable being seated less than a foot away from other guests.  If I were to do it again, I'd certainly do what Phillip T. recommends on his review and request for a premium table overlooking Bellagio or Caesar's Palace no matter how long it takes.  Food in general was good.  Looking back, however, portions were relatively small considering of how much they're charging for each dish.  This surely isn't your rustic Italian joint where you can get large bowls of pasta that can feed a whole town!      Upon ordering, our server brought out a complimentary platter of breadsticks, rosemary focaccia and cheese crisps as well as several accoutrements.  Several antipasti plates then followed which quickly filled our table.  Few favorites include charred octopus, wood roasted mushrooms and Prosciutto di Parma.  The Parmigiano-Reggiano was also good especially when eaten with the wild-sage honey and rosemary focaccia.  I say skip the burrata since texture was quite unpleasant instead of that smooth consistency everyone has been accustomed to.  I opted for the risotto as my main entree since I'm a sucker for creamy pearls of rice prepared w/ tasty seafood broth.  Unfortunately, what was served was rather disappointing: rice was underdone and seasoning was lacking.  Although the scallops were perfectly cooked, I actually would've never thought the dish came with crabs if it weren't for the menu listing the item as one of its ingredients.  While my food was completely amiss, her spaghetti, on the other hand, was easily one of the few highlights of the night.  In fact, I'd pick this over your regular meatball and marinara pasta any day.  One thing that caught my attention as soon as the dish was placed on the table was how enormous the prawns were.  The lemon and basil sauce also went really well with the pasta.  If I could eat this everyday, I absolutely would in a heartbeat!  Service was great and staff knowledgeable of everything on the menu.  Forgot his name but I'm assuming our server was fairly new since he was getting plenty of complaints from other guests.  He even charged our card with someone else's tab; making us wait for some time and not even a dessert was given to compensate for his mistake.  Overall, Giada has become one of the hottest restaurant in the valley as people continue to flock to this joint even after several months of being open.  Having said that, nothing jumps out of our dining experience that makes me want to come back at this establishment anytime soon.",

For breakfast they seemed to be leaving 1/2 the restaurant empty and only seating people by the windows or at the bar.  I sat at the bar to avoid waiting.  The bartender provided good service.  The salmon cakes had a lot of filler and were deep fried to look like a hockey puck.  Given the salmon cakes are supposed to be a Giada signature dish, would figure they make it like the recipes I see on the internet which look a lot better than what I had.",

The restaurant is located inside the newly constructed Cromwell and the space itself is loooooofffly. Bright, clean and spacious while maintaining a cute comforting coziness. I definitely want to live here, but I will settle for raiding homegoods to replicate my home into a cheap interior decor knockoff.   The food: Portions are tiny, as is expected with ~fine dining, yet the quality and flavors of these dishes didn't warrant such a high price tag. Nothing about the flavor combinations was innovative or spectacular; in all honesty it was quite plain and lackluster. Mushrooms with almonds were plain and seriously tiny, chicken marsala meatballs were dry, and the gorgonzola kale salad was good but.. I could make this at home. The rest of the small plates we got were alright but again, so unmemorable that my photographic foodie mind can't even remember what they were for this review.  Cocktails are delicious and strong. The bellinis are great, as is the drink with egg whites (can't remember the name, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.. including the \"G\" monogrammed on top in foam). Service is outstanding, and the wait staff is very attentive. There's also a photobooth where you can entertain yourself with while waiting, but unfortunately none of the pictures were printing while we were there.  Left kind of hungry and with noticeably lighter pockets. Next time, I'll spend my money elsewhere. Granted its Vegas, so what the hell *throws cash everywhere*.",

We were seated at an arced banquette with a view of the strip. Part way into our meal, the windows opened to the outdoors, which brought in a lovely light breeze.   The food, quite frankly, nothing spectacular. Here's what our party of four shared: Fritto Misto app  Meatball app Bucatini Ravioli Fettuccine  Risotto Sweet corn and spicy sausage side dish   We all agreed that the entrees did not meet our expectations; they were just okay, we'd had better. The elements of the meal we most enjoyed were the basket of freshly baked breads, the meatball app and the side of sweet corn and spicy sausage.  I would definitely recommend ordering the latter, as it was particularly delicious.  It left us all wanting more!  Of course one outstanding side dish is not enough of a reason to return.  That said, we don't regret going -- it was an enjoyable evening -- memorable, but not for the food, which I'd give 3-1/2 stars if that were an option.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place.  I mean look at Giada, she is beautiful and successful and so cute when she takes bites of her creations and I mean it was spaghetti (have to say it the way Giada says it).  But as other reviewers mentioned the flavors were off and way more lemony than creamy for spaghetti.  Two giant shrimp on the plate it definitely was pleasant on the eyes.  I have to back up and say that I was dining alone.  I was able to get a reservation using Open Table and it was much later than I like to eat.  I had a few cocktails at a business networking event before walking over but did not snack on any of what would have been subpar food compared to what I was planning to have.  The bread that came was yummy as was the fritto misto.  Since the pasta was bland, I doctored it up with the pesto and red pepper flakes provided on the bread tray.  I felt like it was sacrilege but then again to waste the pasta would have been even worse!  The texture and presentation of the spaghetti were perfect so the extra flavors helped but it may have been better if there had been fresh parm at my disposal.  I didn't dare say anything to my server.  I was quickly filling up so I took the rest to go and kept it in my hotel fridge to finish off the next morning.  It was definitely a good experience but a little overrated.  If I had paid out of my own pocket may have left a different taste in my mouth (no pun intended) but since I was on travel and able to expense the meal, it was worth trying.  For now Giada, I will stick to watching you on tv : )",

Extremely attentive service.  It's pretty spectacular when they open the windows and you have a view of the fountains across the street at the Bellagio.  Drinks were interesting - to be honest, I can't remember the cocktail I had but I loved it.  Three of six of us each had a cocktail and wine with dinner.  One had three beers.    We ordered 4 appetizers - I had the charred octopus salad which was outstanding.  Perfectly prepared octopus with a light dressing, potatoes on the side.  My daughter had the artichoke hearts and they were also excellent.  She devoured them.  She and I split the cacio e pepe which came in a small wheel of Pecorino cheese.  We both have waited a long time to try this dish and it did not disappoint.  The server was kind enough to come around and scrape the melted cheese from the side of the wheel - we'd already discovered how divine it was.  The dish was on the peppery side for my kid but not unpleasantly so (it is \"e pepe\", right?).  Others in our party had the lobster ravioli (my taste was rich, creamy and wonderful, cacio e pepe, and the Wagyu short rib and side of brussels sprouts (they were amazing).  Everyone was very happy with their entrees.    A couple of us shared gelato and the limoncello souffle which was just ok.    Overall, a delicious meal with exceptional service.  The bill was over $500 for the 6 of us.  It is overly pricey but it is situated in a boutique hotel in a prime area of the strip and bears a celebrity chef name so it is not surprising.  Frankly, everything in on the Strip these days is very expensive.",

She gave us an elegant and approachable tour of Giada's culinary creations and beverage offerings. I loved her recommendations. The champagne and wine selections were on point,  paired with Italy's finest meats and cheeses and tantalizing Pizzas or \"pizette\". I only wish we had time to graduate to the next course of pastas and entrees, but I promise soon we will! We were swayed into tasting a little Italian sweet tart lemon sugar cookie and also, what seemed to be a key lime pie tart sent from heaven topped with organic strawberry slices and little baby dollops of toasted meringue!!!  Just, wow. The manager John D. introduced himself and made us feel welcomed and even Alex an additional team member made sure we felt at home too.

We confronted him and he acted as if he was confused and thought we ordered the shrimp cocktail... i never used those two words at all during our 30 minutes at the bar. Ended up paying for it... 60$ later (1 glass champagne & shrimp cocktail).   Then we get seated 10 minutes after our reservation time, we brought our own bottle of wine. We had to keep refilling our own glasses throughout the dinner because service was so bad. The food was VERY mediocre... in a place like this with prices like this you expect the BEST. it was very mediocre, each dish was well over done and had either too much sauce or was over cooked. The service was sloppy. When we got our soup they poured it into the bowl at the table and spilled it all over the floor between us... no one ever came to clean it up. The pasta noodles were over cooked and the meal was overall regretful. It was a mess. I will never come back, rip off and seems like bartender was trying to get a better tip and/or rip us off by ordering us something 10$ more than what we ordered. It's bullshit and I'm very disappointed as i love Giada and her cook books.",

They let us know there's a bar inside if we want to hang out there while we wait, so we did however we walk back to the front because it was 5 mins passed our reservation time and havent gotten called yet. When we got back to the front they called us 5 mins later. I honestly think they forgot about us till they saw us the 2nd time. When I made the reservation I asked to be seated by the window but at first they didn't so I reminded the host and we had wait even longer till there's an available table. Smh. Other than that everything else was great. Our waiter and food was awesome. We love the oysters, the steak, lemon potatoes and even the lemon butter!",

We started out with the pastry basket which was delicious and the antipasta was delicious. I ordered the Salmon Benedict which was alright. Not the best not the worse I've had. My husband got the hash and it was way vegetable then meat. No real seasoning as well.    Overall I think the place is beautiful but food is lacking",

    "text": "It's not easy for me to write this review since I have been a long time fan of Giada. But that being said, I had very high expectations for this restaurant and ended up walking out so disappointed. I couldn't even give this place 2 stars. The only positive thing I have to say about this restaurant is the bright and beautiful ambiance. So if you're coming here for the aesthetics, then be my guest! Other than that, stay far away.  We started with some drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. Service was lacking, as in there was only 1 bartender (on a Saturday). I asked for water as soon as we sat, and it arrived ten min later. We then had to flag down the bartender to order our mimosas. We felt completely dismissed as soon as we got here. When our table was ready, the hostess asked that we close out our tab and even getting the check took some waiting.  We started with an antipasi board which was a let down. Instead of bread, they gave us very thin parmesan crisps. When we tried to cut into the burrata, we realized it was very tough and when we touched it, it felt frozen! We sent it back and asked if they could warm it up. Moments later, it came back and was still cold. How is this acceptable?? We also asked for extra mustard and our server forgot about it and didn't bring it to us until we were already eating our entrees (20 min later).  I ordered a half order of the spaghetti which tasted mediocre and guess what, it also arrived cold. My friend ordered the Salmon Benedict after her first bite, she also wondered if it was frozen. She couldn't even finish eating it. We were both at a loss for words. Is Giada serving frozen food?! That's what it seems like. If I want frozen food I'll go to my grocery store and pay a lot less than what Giada is charging.  The food was very disappointing to say the least. I am honestly questioning the food quality since multiple dishes of ours seemed frozen. The service was just as bad. Our bill was over $100 (before tip) and in my opinion, not worth it. I wish I read the other reviews before coming here but I didn't think I would need to at Giada's restaurant. I honestly wish we left after the first round of food (with the frozen burrata) but we wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. That was a mistake. From one foodie to another, save your time and money and go to Spago across the street. The food is incredible & top quality, and the customer service is top notch.",

    "text": "First off, this place is beautifully designed!! I felt like I was transported to a fancy restaurant IN Italy- with the wood fired stove and seafood, meats, and cheeses on display.  We had a reservation and still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table, but the staff was friendly and we just scoped out what we wanted to drink on their iPad menus...this place is high tech!   We were a party of 4, so the waiter (who was awesome, extremely helpful and funny!) suggested that we split one of their platters. We chose the meat and cheese platter which was accompanied by fresh bread with a variety of accoutrements. The chef chooses the cheeses and meats and they vary- everything was SO SO good especially the fresh honeycomb...oh.my.god.   We also ordered the truffle burrata which was too salty and we didn't finish, the shrimp cocktail which came with HUGE shrimpies, the grilled octopus (also a plentiful sized tapa and was my personal fave- so light and flavorful!!), and the chicken Marsala meatballs (also YUM!)  We were pretty much stuffed to the gills but ordered entrees anyway :P I had the lobster ravioli which had large chunks of lobster and was delish but very rich. Ravioli was cooked al dente. My coworkers had the shrimp spaghetti (looked amazzzzing) and the salmon (huge portion!!)  This place was quite the treat and culinary experience and definitely a place you don't go to ALL the time. I'm giving it 4 stars solely because it was unbelievably pricey and if my work wasn't paying for it, I may never have gotten to try all the things we did.",

Service is friendly, helpful and spot on.  Highlights were the wheel of cheese filled with Giada's homemade pasta.  Cacio e Pepe Bucatiini was delicious.  The stuffed dates were another show stopper.  The fried chicken could be shared between two guest.  The Branzino was prepared with an array of vegetables and very good.   In all, I would come back again and let Giada cook for me.  She is a very talented woman who knows her way around the kitchen.",

First time being in the Cromwell and first impression is... this place is ghetto. I'm pulling into the parking garage entrance and find a guy pissing on the side of the road. Not a homeless guy but a visitor to the hotel. Getting past that, I'm finding a spot to park and this garage is treated like a hangout for people, smoking weed, changing clothes, getting drunk. We make our way into the hotel and find our friends and go to the restaurant. We are seated in the middle of the restaurant and am glad we didn't get seated at the open windows. It's difficult to enjoy an expensive meal with the roaring sounds of traffic and smell of weed wafting by you. The server was trying to push a higher priced menu on us or looked down if we decided to share an item. All in all, food did t suck but wasn't worth the value we paid. Definitely other Italian places that provide way better food and value.",

Even without a window seat, you still have a nice view. The rolls and Parmesan they bring out to start was my favorite part of the whole meal, it was SO good, I would go back just for that. My friend and I shared the lemon potatoes, roasted broccolini, and the Cacio e Pepe Bucatini. I can't explain just how AMAZING the potatoes were. SO GOOD, if you eat here you HAVE to try them. I was a little disappointed in the pasta just because it wasn't as cheesy as I would have expected pasta that was served in a wheel of cheese to be, but it was still very tasty! We finished with some lemon ricotta cookies for checking in our yelp, AMAZING!Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "the moment i stepped onto the escalator as it took me to Giada's restaurant i was feeling excited...the moment has arrived!! all those years of watching her shows and finally i get to taste her food!!! of course a part of me wish to meet her in person at the restaurant.  reservation is a must! we reserved a table at 5:15pm on a saturday. it was perfect timing. not crowded and because of the pace of service, by the time you finish dinner you still have time to do things in vegas (ie: watch a show).  i thought it wasn't going to be kids friendly but they do offer high chairs for little ones.   we were seated by the window which allows us to enjoy the las vegas strip view and the bellagio fountain. This was a plus as it helped entertained my toddler throughout the meal! They dont offer kids menu but they have pizzettes that are suitable for little kids. And with their delicious complimentary breads, that totally can fill up a toddler's tummy! my daughter ate so much bread and breadsticks, by the time the pizzette arrived she was full. as a matter of fact she preferred the complimentary bread basket over the pizzette!!  the complimentary breads were SO good. what really was the star was the condiments that you can pair with the breads! the mascarpone butter was so good, the fried capers was well executed, normally i dont like much capers cuz it's too sour, but this fried capers was different and it balances the sweetness of the mascarpone butter. The basil pesto was mm mm mmmmmm!!    we ordered an appetizer, a sampler of salumi and formaggi... everything was delicious. i didn't know that parmaggiano reggiano would be sooooo delicious with honeycombs! I'm totally going to recreate this at home.. the only problem is getting that type of honey.  i ended up ordering the Short ribs Agnolotti and i thought it was just okay. i don't recommend this dish. the agnolotti was not piping hot, i felt like it was sitting at the kitchen for a long time before it arrived on my table. The pasta was hardening too. The taste was nothing spectacular and the portion was extremely small. I'm so glad we ordered the appetizer and that there were complimentary breads. My husband ordered the white lasagna and that one was way better than my agnolotti.   overall i think the appetizers and the breads outshine the main course. Till this day i am still thinking about the appetizers and the delicious fresh breads and breadsticks!",

The decor details are great (as is the playlist) but the quality of food and the service is lacking.   The portions were a mess. As I said there were 4 of us so for the first course we got two normal sized pastries, a teeny salad to split off a single teacup-sized plate, and a tiny shared plate for the antipasti. We should have each gotten a teacup- sized salad. Why are we sharing that tiny plate? If it was just one person doing the tasting, are they given half a pastry, a slice of cheese and ham, and a leaf of lettuce? It was bizarre. At least give more salad - that is super cheap and was super delicious.   The second course - we all got the pasta- was amazing. So so good and no complaints for me. But my friend did ask for hers with no peas (which the waiter said no problem to) but then she still got peas. It wasn't worth the effort to send back. Service was pretty slow/ inconsistent.   The final course was good but SO BIG. Kind of like a Cheesecake Factory dessert. Why are we each getting giant desserts in our tasting menu? I would so much have rather had a bowl of salad in my app instead of a giant slice of chocolate cake and espresso ice cream. It was good but just way too massive. Definitely not in line with what you all have engraved on the lights there - eat a little bit of everything and not too much of everything.",

First of all, I had the most awesome table with the most awesome view of the Bellagio and the fountain show from a window side table overlooking Las Vegas Boulevard.   Then, my waiter, Nancy was awesome. She was gracious and attentive but never made me feel hurried. She answered all of my questions about the menu and gave me excellent recommendations. And then, I really feel like she actually respected me as a customer/diner. I wasn't just a table that had to be turned. It was truly a pleasure. Thank you Nancy.   And then the food. Omg. The food. I know this sounds cheesy, but I actually felt like I was eating Giada's food. The chicken Marsala meatballs were to die for. And the crostini were good too! And I LOVED the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. I like closed my eyes with each bite I took lol.   I wanted to do dessert, but I was so full. Oh, before I forget, the lemonade that was made in house was sparkly and so refreshing. It really worked well with all the salty/meaty flavors of everything I ate (eloquent) I know!  Finally, Frank the manager came to check on me and gifted with me with complimentary cookies. It was such a great way to cap off my memorable dining experience. (Especially since I was too full to order desert.   From a Mom of a two year old who doesn't get out much, this meal was such a pleasant and wonderful experience. Thanks to everyone at Giada's!  Update: I walked down the stairs and almost out of the Cromwell in a food haze and one of the hostesses chased me down to the first floor so she could give my shopping bag I forgot. Bonus! So awesome.",

    "text": "I have to say this was surprisingly our best meal in Vegas.  Not surprised the food was great, but I didn't expect to be blown away.  The only reason the 4 stars instead of 5 was it was extremely warm in the restaurant and I am usually freezing.  Not sure if there was a problem with the air but the food definitely overcame the temperature!  First lets start with the bread plate OMG it is food porn!  The bread literally will melt in your mouth!   Hubby and I like small plates so we did a tapas style dinner.  We started with the bacon wrapped dates with spicy sausage!  I usually do not like anything with heat, but this brought the right amount of taste without overwhelming me with the spice.  Finished with a Gorgonzola  cheese it was pure heaven to my taste buds.  Next we had the Tricolore prosciutto di parma, gorgonzola, dates, walnuts, Tuscan kale, yellow endive & radicchio.  All of the flavors combined to make this a light but incredibly tasty bridge from the dates to our entrees.  We ordered spaghetti and ravioli as our main dishes.  The ravioli featured lobster that tasted like it just came from the docks with a creamy butter sauce....perfect!  The spaghetti had a light lemon taste making the dish taste light instead of the heaviness you sometimes get with pasta.    The vibe was trendy (music was just a tad too loud) and upscale without feeling pretentious.  Hubby wore jeans and a dress shirt and I wore a dress (hey you gotta dress up in Vegas) but i would say the code is dressy casual.  This will definitely be one of our must have dinners when in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I was waffling between 2-3 stars, so I'll share my pro-con list  Pros: - OpenTable reservation was supz easy (allowed for a drop-down selection of special event and request for window view was fulfilled) - Yelp check-in still works, prosecco (or amuse-bouche on the receipt) was bubbly and on the sweet side. Did not work for the whole table (it did in another review) - cute photo booth  - you can pay with Total Rewards/earn Total Rewards points - the salmon was good  Cons: - butternut squash soup is NOT delightful. (yes, the waiter will tell you everything's delicious and delightful, but I'm still a bit salty about this, and my mom is not the send-back-to-the-kitchen type so she just sucked it up and ate it... which it was her birthday dinner, so... sorry, mom) - the bread plate was good but also weird. no one touched the salt. were we supposed to sprinkle?  - we ordered proscuitto and burrata. and that's all that came. I guess that's just how they eat it in Italy? when I asked the waiter, he was kind enough to bring additional parm crisps and crostini, but it was just one more feature of the dinner that rubbed the wrong way - despite the OpenTable drop-down menu and the hostess double-checking that the special occasion was my mum's birthday, they forgot or maybe they just don't do anything for birthdays? based on the other yelp reviews, I figured they were just going to write Happy B-day on a plate with chocolate with two cookies. Nice sit-down restaurants usually do... something, but at that point of the dinner, I was at the \"screw it\" point - photo booth options (two options: no-filter and black and white; plus I may have sped-read or the instructions may be unclear, but we had to retake our photo as the email button logo was below our photo and easily looked over. i've been in other photo booths where it was more clear; ugh, complaining about a free service, I know)",

The food itself was not as great as expected from Giada's restaurant. My husband ordered lamb chops which were way too salty. They did replace it but as he took the first bite, the salt messed him and he got bad acid reflux with that. So when they brought the replacement, he was not able to eat it bcaz it had already messed up his system. So I feel like we wasted our money. It was not cheap, that dish itself was $60.

This was our first dinner stop in Vegas, what a great start. The best part is that compared to other dinner spots this was more on the affordable side.   Food: I. Was. Not. Disappointed! My coworker got an arugula salad with the chicken meat balls. It was fresh and just what she needed after a long day. I got the sausage pizza and lemon potatoes. This was probably the best pizza I've eaten, it was fresh out of the oven, perfect one person plate and so delicious. The potatoes were nicely fried and seasoned, wish I had enough room in my belly to eat it all. When you check in you get complimentary cookies, the lemon cookie was incredible. The perfect way to end a meal. I wanted to save the best for last, freshly baked bread. I'm a sucker for bread and this was mouth watering-ly good. It comes with this cute plate of butter, pesto and some other sides.   Service: Of course there was an over hour wait so be sure to make reservations ahead of time. We just got really lucky to find a spot by the bar/ lounge which was perfect. Our waitress Lindsey was really nice,the best part was how she'd give us her personal favorites which gives it a really personal touch.   Atmosphere: it's a great dinner spot, a little on the dinner lit side but worked. Has a great view with open windows and the music choice was great.",

    "text": "Oh Ms. Chef Giada, how I love the location you have picked for your fantastic restaurant. The gorgeous view that Las Vegas provides is key to having a delicious dinner with a love one!  The minute you enter to the entrance of Giada resturant you are immediately greeted by a photographer that wants to snap some shot next to the icon signature of the restaurant. I guess the photo booth is no longer there (based on previous Yelp reviews).   You go up an escalator and ARE NOT immediately greeted by the 5 young women standing around gossiping about what they did the night before. WHY, does it take 5 young women to even check you in?? Giada, please look into this because i'm sure you overhead expenses can be spent else where.   After hearing the gossip of the 5 young women standing around, one of the woman noticed us standing there and asked if we had reservations, yes we did.   We were asked to take a seat at the bar since our table was being set up. After a couple of minutes we were seated with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio dancing fountains. We were immediately greeted by our waitress, who was a great joy! In which I forgot about the 5 young women gossiping in front of the check in desk.    The menu was descriptive and sounded delicious! I would recommend the Surf and Turf which was outstanding! Also, Giada signature cocktail was something I would order again and again, until I'm Vegas ready!",

    "text": "For my first trip to Las Vegas, I was adamant about making Giada's one of the places I ate at. I've watched her on TV for years and am I huge fan of Italian food, so my expectations were fairly high going in. I was going in the middle of August and made reservations online in July for just myself on a Friday night at 5pm. A week before my trip I was called to confirm my reservation, which was nice. I arrived about 20 minutes early, and was told that I would have to wait since they weren't open yet for Dinner service, which was fine and about 10 minutes til, I was the first person let in and seated giving myself a view out the windows down the strip.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was very attentive and polite, and explained everything very well. I ordered the Crab Salad Crostini and Mortadella Pizzette for Appetizers to give them a try, and I was blown away by the crab salad. It was fresh and a large serving size. I make it home now on a regular basis but its not as good as what I got. The Pizzete was good, but Not really anything special, felt like it was missing something to make it amazing. For my Entree I got the Spaghetti which came with at first glance not that much food, but once I disassembled it to eat it was quite a large serving and portion, and was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten before. The Shrimp were absolutely massive and I had to cut them into quarters to eat. The Pasta was as I'd expect and cooked perfect with some kind of magical cheese lemon sauce that was just incredible.   The prices were no different than the city where I live, I expected them to be a bit higher to be honest so that was ok as well. Overall having been one of the best food experiences I had while in Vegas, I would almost go back to Vegas just to eat there. If you have the time and like a good atmosphere, I would highly recommend eating here.",

The food wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. We got the caponata which I was very excited about because it's my favorite part of Christmas dinner. It was MUCH different than our family recipe and I actually much prefer ours. We did receive a lovely bread basket with options to top our breads with. The lemon butter is delicious!   I got pasta which was described as being served with lemon, basil and shrimp. I opted to have it without the shrimp. My server asked if I preferred chicken. I told him I preferred no protein. He seemed annoyed which annoyed me. I did receive it without shrimp, however, it was served in a cream sauce which I was very upset about because I wasn't feeling well and was purposely staying away from creams and cheeses. I feel like a cream sauce should be announced on a menu. It was good but VERY al dente. We like al dente pasta but it was on the verge of just being uncooked. We got Giada's favorite cookies for dessert which were great because we could take the leftovers with us!   Our server was ok. He got the job done but he wasn't warm or welcoming. The atmosphere at Giada's is worth a visit alone! So many delicious things on the menu that I would want to try in the future. We would definitely return!",

We had everything that came highly recommended by our waiter: Chicken Marsala Meatballs, Tomato Arancini, Bacon Wrapped Dates and Bucatini. The taste did not disappoint! everything was so yummy. I left thinking I couldn't wait to return. So why the 2 star rating? Well the next morning, I woke up with a massive, itchy rash on my backside. I really thought it was just me, but I was not the only one. Rashes on different parts of our bodies. Leading me to wonder, what was in the food that caused a reaction???",

We arrived and were immediately seated at a lovely table next to the window over;looking the strip. Our waiter promptly brought us water and menus. The menu was beautiful, many choices made it difficult to decide what to order! The wine list is extremely impressive as well. We ordered a bottle of the J bubbles and an order of the stuffed dates and artichoke for appetizers. The artichoke was delicious and perfectly prepared, as were the dates. For entree's I chose the Lobster and Kale ravioli, it was one of the best , flavorful ravioli's I have had.  The sauce and the pieces of lobster were delicious! The Risotto with crab and scallops that my friend had was also amazing. All of the dinners were exceptional! The highlight of the evening was the great service from the Sommelier, He was personable, knowledgeable and truly made the night a great experience!  Giada's will definitely be a destination for us whenever we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "So excited to be at Giana's restaurant. It's an airy and open kitchen venue. We had a little issue finding the right table at first but the hostess with a little extra effort eventually found us a table that was suitable.  Our waiter,  Valentino was very personable and professional. The menu starts with either a tasting menu which consisted of antipasto, pasta, entree and desert or an ala carts menu which for one who has a hard time making decisions seemed overwhelming. With the help of Valentino- we went for the tasting.   The antipasto was tasty olives, spicy cheese stuffed figs and a small meatball. The crackle bread/ bread with pesto, salt, butter and hot pepper was to die for. My angel hair pasta with shrimp small plate was delicious. My husband loved his penne bolognese.   By the time we got to the entree, I for one was full. My salmon was cooked to my liking but not particularly special and spoiler alert....My husband's lamb entree was quite dry. When we told Valentino he was truly saddened and offered to get a new one. We explained there was no need but felt it important that the chef know. He promised to share our critic.   Not being dessert lovers we skipped the beautiful dessert cart and instead we hade a cappuccino which was creamy and delicious and  delivered a large bowl each of natures perfect sugar... berries which were fresh and very satisfying.   Without prompting  the manager came over to our table to express his deep apology for the disappointing lamb and gave a generously large discount off the cost of one dinner. That was never asked for but greatly appreciated.   Oh and we made sure not to miss the photo both on the way out.   All in all I think it was a great experience and we would do it again.",

    "text": "Sorry Giada. I'm going to compare my experience here with my experience at the lunch you hosted in Los Angeles several years ago (which was perfection). Some things just fell short this time around... Like your photo booth. Don't forget to fix that =)  I visited Giada's restaurant and tried the tasting menu. This menu was made up of some of Giada's favorites. Service and food was good. Not mind blowing, however. Giada is pricey and I can't 100% recommend it to everyone. I'd say, check them out for brunch if it's your first visit. You'll invest less money and those chicken and waffles look amazing.  TASTING MENU Bread platter - cool presentation. *Tip: put this aside and eat it if you still have room later. Practically everything else they will serve you is more worthy of your stomach space.   Rigatoni - pasta cooked right. tasty sauce. good dish  Grilled squid - this one was a disappointment. This dish seemed pretty ordinary. The flavor just wasn't right.  Even the texture wasn't what I had hoped for. I had this dish before at a lunch Giada hosted and it was AMAZING. I'm guessing that it is usually better as i have also heard how great this is from others.  Corn Side dish - really tasty. At this point, however, i was getting full and i couldn't enjoy this as much as i'd have liked to.   Crispy Potatoes - good but not as good as the corn.   Wagyu beef short rib - very tender. ok same problem here as the corn. I was full at this point and couldn't enjoy this one that well. Don't get me wrong, i finished every last bit of it haha.   Dessert Cart - Three is a great number Giada.  In fact, it's my favorite. But when you bring such a beautiful cart around, you can't limit us to JUST three items. One of each item sounds appropriate, right?   **COFFEE - After I finished dessert, i was asked if i would like coffee. I assumed this was included so i just went ahead and ordered. Had i known that it wasn't, I definitely would not have ordered this. The drink itself was fine but i had been full three plates ago. Plus, the coffee isn't cheap. Careless on my part, but putting this in case anyone else has the same situation.   SERVICE I like how they let me customize a lot of my order. After looking at the regular menu, I saw some things that I really wanted to try. These weren't options on the tasting menu but they had no problem substituting them in. I even modified the cocktail I ordered.   I also appreciate being seated at the table with the best fountain view. *Note: the restaurant is still only on the 2nd floor and therefore part of the view is obstructed by a bridge.   PARKING I ended up parking at Flamingo's parking structure. Parking is free there and it is a very close walk to Giadas.",

We ordered quite a few things; the bacon wrapped dates, ricotta crostini, meat and cheese platter (amazing), romaine salad, shrimp spaghetti, lobster ravioli, limoncello souffle, assorted cookies, and rose. Overall, everything was delicious. I would definitely come back and recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Brunch review.  Let me just start off by saying that I have waited and always wanted to try her restaurant, because who doesn't enjoy a good Italian dish? I know I do!  If you're planning to visit, reservations would probably make your life easier. We arrived for late brunch, around noon and there was still a 30 minute wait. But we actually got seated at around 45minute mark. Now that's well and fine things happened, but at least acknowledge your guest that things are running late. No they don't have a mobile messaging system to let you know that tables are ready.   Service was a fail for me. If you claim to be a higher end dining place then the level of expectation is obviously different. We were seated and wasn't acknowledged for about 15 mins, no menu, water, hi hello how are you, nope none. We were invisible people. Mind you our table was still a bit dirty from previous service. Ugh.  And then our server finally arrived, she was nice.   We ordered Burrata, they ran out. Ordered another dish.  Timing was off, just when we were served our bread & cheese platter. A server comes running in wanting to serve entree. Uhm. No.  Food was underwhelming, my heart was so broken I was expecting more from Giada. It's her only restaurant so I figured she was on top of her game with QC control  App: Mozarella with chili pesto - was bland there was no heat and the basil was non existent  Orzo Meatballs was average  Muffalada, lacked olives was bland  G's baked pasta, I kid you not, the Rao's bottled pasta sauce tastes way better  Sangria, white was one dimensional  Lemonade was tasty the first time we got it, it had club soda and maybe basil in it the refill was just plain lemonade.  Both $6. Beyond pissed when we saw the bill. Oh and it took forever to get a refill, yes we knew it was not bottomless. Our server just disappeared over yonder somewhere  Paying our bill took another 15-20mins  Interior design looks amazing, minimalistic chic and modern. That's the only star otherwise they'd get 1.  If ever you're in LA, try Osteria Mozza, Italian food done right and spot on service",

    "text": "I was surprised by our experience at Giada's at the Cromwell.   We were greeted at the top of the escalator to the restaurant and invited to take a pic in their photo booth.   It was a cheesy photo booth that just appeared to make the beginning of our dining experience questionable.   The waiting area had dirty furniture.   We were seated fairly quickly in the dining room where my husbands couch/booth style seat was too low, so the table was at his mid-chest area, so he looked like a little kid at the table.  He is 6 ft tall, so it was just odd.   I was in a chair on the other side, so the table fit me well.   Our server, Carlos, immediately attempted the up-sell with full dinner experience and menu cards that we could take home, but we did not see the need fo that much food.   Once we ordered, we never saw him again, but received good service from who I think was our water glass filler.   I don't think Carlos was too interested since we didn't order the expensive dining plan.    We started with the bacon wrapped dates.   We received about 5 which was ok, but they were much sweeter than I thought they would be.    I wished the sweet and salty had a little more balance.   I share pics of our complimentary bread plate with olive and rosemary breads.   The breads were good, but pairings were odd.   The pesto was good, but the rest seemed like a waste.   The parings included salt, crushed red peppers and fried capers.   Our dinner pasta plates were good.   My husbands food was a little too spicy, and the portions were small, but a good size for one person.   The atmosphere was so noisy that we could not hear each other.   I guess I had expected more of an upscale calm dining environment.   We laughed as we watched the couple at the next table try to talk to each other and gave up, too because it was so noisy.   In the end, I do not regret going, but would never recommend it.   Feeling disappointed as i watch Giada cooking shows so much.   I probably will not watch as much now.   Oh, and there is no view of the fountains at the Bellagio even though that was in the summary on the webpage for the restaurant.   The view is blocked by the walkway that goes over the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Horrible experience tonight, embarrassing to say the least as I recommended this place and invited my father here for his birthday. After eating the appetizer ,bacon wrapped dates,I became very sick, I ended up throwing up in the handicap stall in the bathroom. I couldn't eat one bite of my dinner that I had ordered. I have been here several times before but the waiter Diego was not compassionate towards us at all. It wad evident with his body language and lack of communication I tried to put myself in his shoes what if he was having a bad day but he really was just awful. I should of complained to the manager but I didn't. Hope Diego stops acting snooty and all high and mighty. Worst night ever.",

The branding was a bit much: \"Giada\" on the napkins, the plates, the walls, the light fixtures, I could go on. Even the after-dinner espresso drink featured a cocoa-powder \"g.\"  We decided to eat here before seeing Absinthe. We had another restaurant in mind, but the wait was an hour and a half, so we changed our plans. We were seated right away at Giada, which we appreciated.  For both Italian food and the best service, I prefer Nora's or, if you want to eat on The Strip, Osteria Costa in the Mirage.   That said, my husband did say that the meatballs were pretty good--which is praise from my Italian American honey--and he said his lobster ravioli were excellent. I think he enjoyed his food more than I did, but I have some dietary restrictions.",

We never got water refills or asked if we wanted more wine. Our server was hard to flag down and get to our table. He finally dropped off our check and disappeared for 20 more minutes. I finally saw him, had to get up, and asked him to come to our table.   The food was delicious. We got a lot of apps because we didn't want a full stomach before going out. Most notable-- The Chicken Marsala Meatballs were great but my mom said the portion size had shrunk since she had them a few months ago. We also had the spinach buffalo ricotta pizette. YUM!!   The ambience is great if you're sitting in the main dining area. The dessert cart was a little much. It couldn't fit through the tables and kept hitting my chair. Really annoying.   I'm giving this review 4/5 stars in hopes that this isn't normal service.",

My friend asked to be seated by the window (considering there were seats to choose from). The host told us that wouldn't be a problem, except we needed to walk outside and have a seat until they called us back in. We were confused as to why she told us to go back outside. There were a few lounge type seats near the bar, so we decided to sit there. About 5 mins later someone came over to seat us. Then there was another 10-15 minute wait before a waitress greeted us. We ordered right away. Food took FOREVER to come. What was even more disappointing was that it tasted stale. The waitress also forgot to bring our tea/coffee. We had to ask a busboy to bring it out because she was nowhere to be seen. When she finally came to check on us we asked for water. That took forever and then she spilled it all over the table and left it there.  A continental breakfast from any hotel chain would've probably been a better choice. Sorry to say but I won't be going back there!!",

Hubby & I came here on June 21 2014 for a belated birthday celebration for him!  Upon arrival we were greeted w smiles & the staff was very attentive...  A very sweet young lady gave us a tour of the restaurant as we were waiting to be seated... you are greeted someone making homemade pasta... Yay!  The Open Concept of the restaurant is so fantastic - ask for a table by the terrace... that is where we sat.  You can enjoy a view of strip - close up ;-)  Gorgeous Restaurant setting!  There is a bar where you can enjoy a limited menu if you do not have a reservation... (sold out until mid July) The bar alone looks like a place we would like to hang out in the future - just for drinks / happy hour? - the vibe was very inviting...  Now onto the food / service:  The server (Vincenzo) was well versed about the menu items - he gave recommendations to enhance our experience.  The quality of the food was tops! She has a very vast menu w sooo many options...  The presentation of bread was very unique & yummy! If you order salad they come out w this larger than life Pepper Grinder... loved it!  We decided on the Calde as our hot appetizer... delish! We shared the Branzino & Bucatini as our main - I would suggest sharing if it is just two of you... you fill up on the yummy appos beforehand!   For dessert we sipped on the Nocciotella coffee & noshed on his birthday cake! Yummm!!!  All the food was so delectable! We will definitely come back so that we may decide on what is our favorites...  Do not forget to take your pic in the cute photo booth to make some memories...  Wonderful dining experience... Memorable birthday for my baby!  your constant companion,  ~deirdra",

I don't know much about Giada as a public figure, however my fiance wanted to bring his mother there for Mother's Day. We made a reservation and got seated right by the window. I definitely recommend making a reservation and I'll tell you why later. Also, it has a great view of the strip definitely ask for a window seat. I have gone there two times and had two different experiences the first time was again, for Mother's Day. We made a reservation got seated right by the window and everything was excellent except for the fact that they decided to open the windows. This made us all cold because it was so early in the morning the strip hadn't gotten hot yet ever, the second time I went they have the windows closed the entire time. The service was amazing, the food was amazing, they even had a specialized menu for the occasion and gave complimentary champagne to each mother in the restaurant. I thought that was fantastic. A brilliant idea. I had such a great experience that I wanted to go again. The next time I was in Vegas, I made my fiance take me for another brunch. This time we didn't have such a great experience. I guess we were a little hangry upon arrival so that didn't help, however we did make a reservation and got seated about 45 minutes after our reservation. Our hunger just kept growing and we knew if we left at that point we wouldn't eat for another 45 minutes because we relocated anyways. So we just stuck it out and were patient. By the time we got there we were so hungry we barely and joyed our meals. For this reason I was unable to give a five star review, but the food is excellent, the service is excellent, I would definitely recommend Giada's.",

We had the tasting menu for $120 each.  This included a take home menu, recipes, and signed picture of Giada. The following is included in the tasting menu: a small plate of antipasti (my only complaint is that it was too small), a pasta course, main course and then a free shot at the dessert cart.  My party made full use of the dessert cart and tried many of the offerings.  The dessert cart guys were very cool and encouraged us to try as much as we wanted.  The cart had a huge selection of 4 ice cream, 4-5 cookies, a few tarts, 3 parfaits, and 3 cakes plus a few things I am probably forgetting.  We got about 10 items off the cart and the highlights were the peanut butter and jelly parfait, peanut butter and chocolate cookie, and lemon ricotta cookie.  I am going on and on about the dessert, but the pasta and salmon we had was also very good.  I really want to go back and I hope they open for lunch soon!  The highlight of the night was that Giada was there!  She was very gracious and stopped for a moment so we could take pictures with her on her way out to catch a plane.  It is good to see that she is very involved in the success of the restaurant over a month after they opened.  It definitely shows in the quality of the food.",

She said she didn't know as there were five parties ahead of us!  We left immediately because it was definitely going to be another hour before they seated us.  If you want to be a great restaurant you need to be able to seat guests within a reasonable time of their reservation, especially on a Wednesday night! 15 minutes is okay, over an hour is not.

    "text": "I can't express how thoroughly disappointed I was dining at Giada. As a long time fan of hers, I was so excited to finally try her restaurant.   The restaurant is beautifully appointed, The design is warm and comfortable, yet modern and interesting  Maybe they were having a terribly off night, maybe there was a new chef in the kitchen, I don't know... But from the 'could care less' bartender, to the completely over cooked two dishes of pasta, I felt totally ripped off by the whole experience.  We sat at the bar, and were greeted by the bar back, but it took at least five minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge us, even though he was talking to a gentleman about 5 feet away from us.   We decided to have dinner there at the bar.  From the get go the bartender had an attitude like he had better things to do. And we are two overworked moms who just wanted to have a fun night in Las Vegas, we were trying to make a connection with him and he just wasn't having it.  Moving on to dinner. It took FOR VER to get everything.  We started with the octopus appetizer. We both love octopus, but this was so over cooked. It's as if they did a quick char on it and then left it sitting under a heat lamp. Which was unfortunate, because it probably would have been a pretty decent dish.   Then we had a ricotta appetizer, I think it was the ricotta  crostini, this was the best dish of the night.   We Then shared both the spaghetti with shrimp and the Bucatini  with ricotta.   It literally took 40 additional minutes from when we finished the octopus to getting our pasta. And we asked about it twice. The bartender smugly said \"good things come to those who wait\".  Both of these pastas  were so over cooked that even my four-year-old would not go near them. They were like mush. After both trying both dishes, we told the bartender How over cooked they were, instead of offering different dishes, he just asked if we wanted him to take them off the bar.   It was awkward, and uncomfortable, and I would never put myself in that space again.   I like to think that Giada  would've been mortified at The handling of her recipes, and the treatment of her guests.   I'm only giving this two stars because of that ricotta appetizer, and the drinks... At least the jerky bartender made a good cocktail.",

    "text": "Walking in, there is a view of fresh ingredients and appetizers displayed in the easily seen kitchen. The atmosphere had an overall modern luxury vibe which was shown through the employee uniforms, furniture, and the art/design. The place was booked so we sat in the lounge area. The service was unsatisfactory from our waitress but the restaurant manager who introduced himself earlier made us feel welcome.  The service remained poor, but we ordered and ate appetizer and entree. At one point the waitress from the table next to us dropped a white wine glass. The wine and shattered glass got on me, and they apologized. The manager once again came over and personally apologized and comped our meal. So overall the bad service was balanced out by the attentive and understanding manager (Avi).  Anyway, now to the only part that matters; the FOOD. We ordered the rigatoni, salumi pizzette, and tortellini plates along with the medium veggie appetizer assortment. All the food was absolutely exquisite. Everything was fresh, and had an original and unique twist to classic dishes. I highly recommend this place despite the flaws in service.   Also, the desserts are epic too so leave some room!",

The restaurant was truly beautiful. The decor was so personal and modern. It felt like sitting in her living room. The views were spectacular as well. You can catch the Bellagio fountain show from your dinner table.   The food was delicious. It was the lightest and freshest Italian food I have ever had. We ordered the spaghetti which was composed of handmade pasta, capers, and prawns in a light lemon olive oil sauce. It was so refreshing and not oily at all. We also ordered the frito misto which came with lemon aioli. The seafood was fried to a crisp perfection. The calamari salad we had was okay. We also ordered a margherita pizzete. It was so light and airy.   Giada's also offers a very delicious bread platter with a series of different spices and toppings complimentary with your meal. It was great. She also have us Italian Basil Lemonade on the house. It was crisp and refreshing.   Overall, we had a great experience at Giada's. Everything was perfect. Congrats on being the first female chef on the Strip!",

    "text": "First time here and a big fan of giada so had high hopes. I loved our meal. We had the lemon and crab arrancini, rigatoni with vegetable bolognese, and surf and turf. I felt like I was watching one of her shows and eating the dishes as she describes them. She cooks with lots of lemon, parsley and parmesan which are definitely present in her restaurant dishes and I like that she's putting things on her menu that she really would/does cook.  The arrancini were light on the inside and super crispy with good lemon flavor. The bolognese was terrific very earthy flavor and bold like when you get it with meat but it was vegetables.   I think her style of cooking is good fresh flavors but not   overly complex. You can taste the pea soup and actually taste peas, parsley and maybe a touch of mint maybe lemon too. I think you have to appreciate that kind of style to really enjoy a meal here.  I actually also make her recipes from her tv shows at home so they are good and accessible. Sometimes you find recipes and need to buy so many ingredients you go broke. Or have to spend so much time prepping you are exhausted by the time your are done cooking.  I really feel like her style of cooking is reflected here.  All in all I thought the food was delish. Prices are quite reasonable for a high end place. Our bill was $136 before tip but included a glass of wine  appetizer and two mains.  Would definitely go back.",

    "text": "It all started when we tried to book reservation for Valentines day- a dinner for 2 at Giada. Wow, how exciting! We couldn't get a table for 2 on that day. So... we settled for the previous night at 4:30 pm....Not as romantic during the daylight!  So while we were anticipating a loving \"evening\" dinner for two- what we got was far from romantic and closer to pedantic!  When we arrived on time, we were directed to the bar. Uh...ok, we'll have a drink. We were given a hi-tech screen menu from which to choose the cocktails of our liking.  I wanted a bloody Mary- simple tomato juice, vodka, lemon juice, pepper and maybe a celery stalk.  The aloof male- handsome and bearded- made for the part-\"bar tender\" was not amused that I was surprised that there was No tomato juice nor V8 juice. What? I exclaimed.... no tomato juice!!??!! I settled for a Giada's Bloody Mary. It was not palatable. The color looked like a brown liquid excrement that was totally undrinkable, the taste fowl. A female tender came to my rescue from this concoction. She said Giada had her opinions of how a bloody Mary should be prepared to be unique and unprocessed. \"Unprocessed\" what the hell is tomato juice!?!? I knew from that point that we'd be hearing her lemming staff reiterate during the meal that \"it's the way Giada wanted it\"- it was going to be a disappointing dinner. At least they didn't mess up my Martini. By the way, the  2 hosts behind the bar were TOTALLY non verbal with the clientele. Exactly what you do not want at a restaurant bar. We were then seated, thank God we got away from those 2 snobs! We ordered appetizers- chicken marsala meatballs, beef tenderloin crostini, clams then 2 minestrone soups and an \"arrugala\" salad. I ordered a lobster ravioli. Two appetizers were to be served with the main meal but were premature. The steelhead salmon as referenced on the menu is typically referred to as a trout and should be referred to as a trout- not a steelhead salmon. Of all the steelhead I have caught on the Salmon river out of Lake Ontario, none were ever called a steelhead salmon. Picky? yes. But you need to be a bit more humble. The soups were bland and skimpy at best- lacking seasoning. Our salad was not what we ordered. They sent a romaine salad. Not bad, but not what we ordered.  When selecting a wine, I had a problem reading the menu with a long very obvious hair dangled in my sight of view which I hand to swipe away to see what I wanted to order. But i digress..... No spoon on an Italian table? They did bring spoons for the soup, good idea.There were no table cloths. Not entirely bad except that between servings neither the table nor the place mats were wiped! So much so that when our desert was being prepared, our waitress placed our utensils among the leftover debris making sure they weren't placed ON the debris instead of just cleaning it up before placing down the silverware. When the dessert was presented, we petitioned the waiter to clean the table before putting down our deserts.  A waitress came and cleaned up the scene and appeared to be put out by having to do so. Unfortunate but True it was. She said our coffees were in process- waiting on the barista.  Our deserts came and the coffee didn't. No longer desiring to continue our dessert without coffee, we decided that it was now too much to tolerate. We asked for the check which by the way was 5 star tab for a 2 star performance. No manager came to our table and on the way out we informed 2 \"suits\" of our dismay. One just looked at me and the other, when I told HIM of our dissatisfaction, asked if i wanted to talk about it.  I told him to read about it on yelp! Giada better look at a few reruns of kitchen nightmares and/or restaurant make-overs to get her act together.  For the readers.... don't fall for the celebrity, the pretty face nor the wonderful TV prepared meals she appears to put together so professionally.   What you see on TV is staged. She can't stage reality and the reality is disappointing to say the least. Save a pot of money and eat good....eat elsewhere. When we drove up to valet and when we were leaving as well, the attendants couldn't be more polite, concerned and caring about our experience. They wished us to return but for their sake we're sorry that's not gonna happen.",

The hostess said they were running behind and suggested we get drinks at the bar without apology.   We were comped prosecco and seated 30 minutes later. Apps were comped while we waited 60 minutes for entrees to arrive. My salmon, (which was offered as medium by the server) arrived well done. I sent it back and another arrived within a few minutes, but medium well. At that point I was so hungry I just ate.   Finally the check dropped after we declined dessert for fear of another lengthy wait. Meanwhile, management nor service ever came by to apologize for the long waits. This was not a hospitable means by any means.",

    "text": "Unfortunately we experienced the worst service here during our stay in Las Vegas. We dined all over the place and this was the most disappointing because of our server Christopher.  FOOD Our lunch was good, but nothing spectacular. A nice, light lunch - portions are on the smaller side. If you have one of Giada's cookbooks you could probably replicate most of the menu yourself easily.   SERVICE We arrived on time but waited 10 minutes for our table, no big surprise. Restaurant was not what I would call busy though when we were finally seated. Our server, Christopher, greeted us and took our drink and food orders pretty quickly. This was the last we heard from him for at least 20 minutes. We're pretty patient people, but when you receive your food before your drinks you know your waiter is not doing his job. Christopher was either working a table of six women behind us (bigger tip prospects, I guess) or just standing around. We tried to get his attention several times when he walked by without checking on us to no avail. The bussers assisted us more in the end. When Christopher finally asked us how our food was (we were already done, waiting for the check by this point) my husband thanked him for finally coming back to check on us and Christopher seemed very surprised that we weren't happy with him. He apologized and said he was just slammed with tables (we counted three, including us). We didn't ask for any freebies but he did take our drinks off the check which was appreciated. I was going to speak with the manager on the way out, because Christopher's service was so bad - it was like we did something to piss him off...not order enough?...we were younger and this place was full of 60-yr-old's?...but the manager was sitting down and eating so I figured he was possibly the problem in the first place.  Long story, I know, but looking back at our excellent dining experiences in Las Vegas with amazing servers our time at Giada and deep disappointment just needs to be said.",

We were disappointed with the dessert, so at no charge, he brought us another one which we liked much better. But, I still think the dessert portion of the menu needs to be readdressed. Add a classic Tiramisu please! I would have given a 4 star, but Jason did such a good job, I gave a 5. The best food we had the entire week in Vegas. Nice ambience, casual cool. Great view of strip.

    "text": "Conclusion-- Service sucked. Food was ok. One of my hot food was served cold   First time, we were party of two went to have lunch. This place is busy and when you don't order alcohol and not a big group, waiter does not pay attention to you.  This is how they do. They have waiter who takes order and supposely check on the table every once in a while to see if everything is ok, then there is a person who comes around to keep refilling water, then there is a person who brings ordered food and take dirty dishes off the table. Im giving not so good review because  1. Waiter took our order. But when server brought our food, it was wrong. Obviously the waiter didn't pay attention to us because he was listening half heartedly while taking order. I was trying to confirm to him but he was walking away already. So technically I could not have lunch together with my mom since her correct order didn't arrive for another 15 min.  2. We waited 30 min before our wrong order was served. No bread was served during the waittime. I called later to find out that they stop serving pre-meal complimentary bread for lunch. They only serve bread at dinner time.  3. During the meal, I had nobody asked us to see if everything was ok. Waiter came to our table the 2nd time to leave the bill on our table. He did NOT acknowledge the mistake he made or anything or the sort.   Giada is a high profile celebrity chef. When people come to her restaurant, I think they expect good service with excellent food. But the problem is that such restaurant is so busy and we don't get the attention we deserve as paying customers.    I would give a try to see for dinner next time. Hope I would receive good experience.",

The reservation was made for 6 guests two months in advance with a request to be by a window or the balcony but we ended up behind a large column about 2-3 feet in diameter. $24 for a cup of pasta is very weak and the menu was extremely limited with only two pasta choices on the menu. I would not advise going to this restaurant for any special occasion if you expect them to make a fuss. Don't worry the only one that made my mother in law feel special was our waiter. At the end of an extremely overpriced 80th birthday lunch they could have redeemed themselves making it a special event if they had served my mother in law a complimentary surprise desert but they did nothing. If this is going to be a gourmet Italian restaurant they need to work on the \"Giada's experience\" which fell off a cliff once they seat you. There should be a small surprise  first course brought to the table, such as a special soup, a tiny but flavorful horsduvre, etc., and something for the person celebrating their birthday, promotion, wedding, etc at the end. The Italian version of a ritz cracker didn't impress as a bread substitute.  Giada's doesn't go the extra mile to justify the premium prices and there are dozens of Italian restaurants with equal or better food at half the price and double the \"experience\".   I could not bring a customer here...",

I'm big on noticing the huge elephant in the room screaming I can barely squeeze in the chair and my bf had to move the table to let me up to use the rest room Im 110 pounds but can I have a decent table on my birthday? There was literally no room our chairs were either back to wall or my bf chair to chair very unpleasant. Why we were not moved is beyond my comprehension? It's not the food or waiter that sucked for me it was the table and the fact that we obviously didn't fit in the space when we sat down. We should of never been sat there in the first place. We should of complained but we just tried to make the best of it. I'm a huge fan of Giada and I'm glad I got to go to this place but it's not like we can dine out often. So please staff can you notice the people that you over look and try some common sense. It's team work not Tetris.",

Giada's recipes are typically very good. Unfortunately it didn't transfer to her restaurant.  We had a horrible dinning experience. Our server delayed our food, brought out items we didn't order several times and made us wait for almost half an hour for the desert cart because he didn't flag down the cart. With all being said, the manager was nickeling and dimeing us on the refund. We paid for the food aswell as the experience. The experience was awful. The food was equally bad and we lost so much time waiting on incompetent waiter for simple requests. Giada, you've changed our perception of you based on your representations from the waiter to the manager. Will not go to any other restaurants with your name on it. I find myself not watching her cooking shows and  looking up her recipes alot since this experience either.",

He was an older gentleman with an adorable French accent, (His name is Thierry) which definitely made us like him so much the more. He was very helpful and answered all of our questions. The other servers were very attentive as well, my water glass was kept full for the entire duration of our visit.  The food was delicious. I loved everything I ordered,  I even asked to take some of the bread and pesto sauce!! The atmosphere was a definite plus, very homey and welcoming. You should definitely make reservations if you plan on going to Vegas, it's worth it!!!!",

We are used to eating at pricy restaurants ..... We are not fast food people so it's not that we are yahoos and we were prepared to spend money .  Salads were great , appetizer , pastas were all good .  My Seafood Risotto lacked flavor for the risotto , but the scallops were perfect .  My husband liked his lobster Ravioli .",

    "text": "Cliff and the team at Giada took excellent care of us from the minute we walked in. As soon as we mentioned we were there to celebrate our friends' wedding the day before, the staff offered to take pictures of us with our cocktails, stayed to chat a bit, and we truly felt at home.  After much deliberation and with Cliff's guidance, we chose the tasting menu for the table (which comes with souvenir menus and recipes) and the charcuterie antipasti platter. We came as close as we could to licking the plates without losing our dignity! The girls had the lemon pasta with shrimp and the boys had the vegetable bolognese,  which despite what your traditional ideas of bolognese may be, definitely convinced our carnivorous men.  The lamb chops won the evening, and I quote: \"best quality cut of lamb I have ever tasted\". I took the veal chop substitution, and while it was good, I have to admit I would not stray from the original suggestions if given a second chance. The lamb and filet were both better in my opinion. Luckily the bride was gracious enough to give me one of her lamb chops!  Dessert did not disappoint (polenta cake with tomato strawberry jam! Mascarpone cheesecake! And those lemon cookies omg) and we got a few extra things to take back to the hotel room fridge when we told Cliff our favorites.  TL;DR: Giada will not disappoint and I would 100% recommend for any special occasion you may be celebrating in Vegas. From service to food to ambience, top marks.",

    "text": "Giada - please read ...this review is for YOU ...not people considering your restaurant - this is for you and those around you who are running your restaurant - and here's why...  This is NOT a review about terrible wait times: we had a reservation and were seated immediately.  This is NOT a review about bad service: the hostess smiled a million-dollar \"Giada\" smile, wished one of our party \"Happy Birthday\" and acted as though we were a very special guest in the home...(in other words - what people have stated about bad service, \"straight faced, serious\" wasn't close to the truth as we experienced it) ...  ...further, the waiter was a top-notch guy from Italy, who acted and treated us just as the hostess did ...as though we were his only guest/table...(and this even after we asked to switch to another, more intimate, table, which was done so immediately without problems) ...  ...the partner/server treated us just as well and was as professional as could be and very personable...  ...the entree server, however, treated us like he had an issue or a chip on his shoulder - nearly shoving the food onto the table, making a loud \"clank\" noise with each plate, almost purposely showing us disdain for some reason (we're not one to play the race card ...and it won't be mentioned who or what race was involved - save to say, we're an interracial party - and he seemed to possibly have that as an issue.  While we've experienced this before in other restaurants and other cities, sometimes it's tough to tell if someone's simply having a bad day - providing bad service, or if they actually do have an issue with you for cultural/racial reasons.) ...let's move on...  This is NOT a review about the food: the food, however, was terrible.  The cocktails were good - but the appetizers and chicken dinner/cacciatore for 2 were the opposite of the recipes we've made from your site and cookbooks (as we are gigantic fan of yours - have your cookbooks, watch your show daily etc.etc.) ... but there were no complaints made and nothing returned - purposely (even amongst ourselves - and we imagine some of you may agree - the only thing worse than a less-than-perfect meal, is the complaints and irate-nature of a less-than-civil patron or dinner-guest.  Unless the place has literally made you ill, write your \"wrongs\" here - don't ruin everyone else's night ...just make the best of it.)  This is NOT a review about the atmosphere: It was stunning and beautiful and perfect (nice, smokey firewood aroma as you enter- beautiful ambience.)  So, what IS this review about???  This...  By listening with the 3rd ear on the entire experience, we came to realize something that many \"absentee owners\" run into and is the reason they subsequently fail: If you don't choose the right people at critical moments in the hiring - when the cats are away, the mice will play.  It appears your restaurant is suffering from that very choice - those you have surrounded yourself with.  Some (not all - as mentioned above) literally state the song-and-dance they must in as lack-luster a manner as possible (with the demeanor of \"yeah yeah - here's my kool-aide pitch while inside I think Giada's a real ______\")  - they have no loyalty to the product they serve, nor the way they are coming off nor to you.    We really got a sense of the above the next night prior to closing; we came back to have wine/cocktails.  We saw our great waiter/\"new friend\"- True to form, he shook my hand - and  told us the bar would be open until 1am and to have a seat and enjoy ...  ...when we did sit at the bar, the bar-tender seemed to see us as a problem and were treating us very second rate ...while treating her \"hip\" friends to gossip, etc...as though the bar service was not really her job (we've all seen an employee's friends show up - giving the employee license to \"hang out\"...)  ...so let me state clearly - this \"non-review\" is actually pointing out the tell-tale signs that your people are NOT watching your back ...as she, the bartender, poured the wine I literally had to say \"whoa! You can stop - that much wine is going to make me crawl outta' here! lol\" - it just seemed she didn't care she was literally filling a (huge) wine glass near full..and she would have kept going had i not raised the alarm.  This was just one of many, many small \"alarms\" that the sum of the whole would make any owner, had she known, pause for concern.  So let me wrap this up - if you read my past reviews, you'll see credit where it's due and harsh reality where things go wrong, with suggestions as to why or how to fix.  That said, as mentioned at the start - this review isn't for others to decide on going to your restaurant - this review is for you to understand you have people there that do not have your interests at heart.  Some do - some do not.  It would be great if you could weed them out and provide a beautiful experience to match the beautiful restaurant your name and reputation deserve.  Thanks...  Johnnie",

    "text": "First, let me say, the space, view, and all the decor and tableware are wonderful and well thought except overdoing it on \"Giada\" branding everywhere you look.  The problem is the branding is what they are selling as the food fell flat. This place is a real moneymaker with high prices and very small portions. Maybe that's how Giada stays so thin!!  Dinner for 3 included the tasting menu with 1 bottle of moderately priced wine, 1 cocktail   plus gratuity (service was excellent) came to $750!!  Potions extremely small, even considering it was the tasting menu.  One dish I I had was the mushroom pasta choice that was very gummy and sent back. Replaced with tortellini choice that was crunchy!!  Forget it!!  A companion we had dinner with had been there once before and said he had previously found the pasta \"gummy\".  I had the Bronzino as the main course which was ok but bland. My companions were not impressed with their choices either.   Without further ado... I would save your money and avoid this tourist trap. Too many better choices with chefs that are actually there preparing the meal as opposed to lending their name to a restaurant group. I wish I had my money back!!  Giada should be ashamed!!",

    "text": "I was very, very, very disappointed when I went to Giada's since I am a huge fan of her show and recipes.  I went to Giada's on July 26, 2015 for dinner. I made reservations for my party of 7 for 8:00pm. We arrived to the restaurant at 8:05pm, and we were asked to wait while they were setting up our table. While we waited, my party and I took advantage of the complimentary photo booth that is right outside the restaurant across from the hostess stand.  Once we were seated about ten minutes later, our server Rocco was very informative and patient with us as we were a larger group. Rocco is probably the only redeeming factor in my experience at Giada's.   My group ordered antipasti for the table - the orzo meatballs, calamari & shrimp, and the Cacciatore Tartufo (salami dish). I believe there was a misunderstanding between my ordering and Rocco because a cheese dish came out instead of the salami. Rocco was very accommodating and fixed this quickly and left us the cheese plate, which ended up being one of the only things I enjoyed. The cheese was so aromatic, full of truffles and I knew instantly I was in love. The salami was a great pairing for the cheese as it was a perfect mellow flavor to cut the sharpness of the cheese! I highly recommend these! The other only thing I enjoyed for the night was the calamari and shrimp. I know it sounds very cliche to order calamari at a Italian themed restaurant, but the calamari and shrimp was seasoned very well and the lemon aioli made the dish.  For my main course, I ordered the lobster ravoli and it was decent. The sauce was very light and I was not expecting that, but I feel like it wasn't very developed as a sauce. The other people in my party ordered the crab and scallop risotto (it ended up tasting better if you sprinkle some of the truffle cheese on top), the bucatini (not impressive), and the whole roasted chicken for two (I was told it was dry, but the caccitore was a flavorful touch).  All in all, I expected a higher quality meal for the price I paid. Would not go back.",

    "text": "So...this.  I've been dying to try out this joint because I LOVE GIADA. I really do. 90% of my favorite unhealthy recipes are from her show. So of course, I'd want to try the recipes at her restaurant.   Firstly, we came here for Valentine's Day because we're nuts. I made reservations a month in advance. We only did this because we were going to a concert on the strip. And I was told I was allowed to pick any place I wanted to eat. :|  So, we get there super late. 20 minutes later than our reservation and I was blown away that they still took us. First star.   Second star: The decor and view is excellent. It's very warm and contemporary. I love the seating and the light fixtures. Even the music was excellent. It's perfect jazzy.   Third star: our waiter was a complete weirdo and loved to make horrid jokes. But, he was very attentive and brought out our food in a timely manner.   Third star: The food was excellent. I will say this, it was a bit salty on a lot of the dishes. We ordered the Valentine's Day special prefix meal. It was a TON of food for $125 a person for a 4 course meal. Some things that we had: Lobster Ravioli. Very good. The pasta was homemade and the lobster inside was small, but it was tasty. Truffle and prosciutto bacon risotto. This was excellent. The prosciutto bacon was super SUPER salty, but it's hard for me because I love salt. I just try to not eat so much of it. The truffle seemed baked and hardly had the taste or smell of truffle. BUT, the risotto was awesome. It's a recipe that I've made myself.  Bacon wrapped scallops: Perfection. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the bacon around it had a very full flavor.  Lamb: The lamb was the best thing of the night. Which, I already ate so much that it was hard to finish. But, the lamb was so tender that it melted in your mouth. Served with whipped grits to top off the flavor.   Overall, this place was very good. BUT, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the pricing was a bit much. Yes, I get that it's on the strip. Yes, I get that it's quality food. But, $20 for a tequila cocktail is nuts. Just for two of us, we spent over $400. I know I can get this type/quality of food or better off the strip for half of the price if not more. I just hate that being on the strip really takes advantage of that. I would love to come back here, but I do not want to pay those prices.",

They just treated us so terribly, and I felt almost discriminated because I didn't have a reservation. Is that supposed to determine whether or not you're gonna give customer service?

But then this is Vegas so I shouldn't be surprised right?  While you wait there's a photo booth which is kinda fun! And it's free!! Plus! We sat in a private room since we were a party of six. One wall of the room is where all her wine is kept! One whole wall was filled with wine. There was also a terrace and a nice view of the strip in that room.  I have to say that their servers are very knowledgeable! The man who served us was so polite and gave us such exceptional service!!!  On to the food... They serve you with this complimentary bread which was absolutely delish!! It was a rosemary bread, bread sticks and some kind of cracker with tons of cheese on it. It also was plated beautifully! They give you a plate which had mascarpone butter, sea salt, chili's which compliments the bread! They probably gave us 6 of them! Which we demolished!! Lol we also ordered an antipasta dish. Had 2 kind of cheese, pears, honey, nuts and two types of meat. Absolutely tasty!  I ordered The Spagehetti, which is one of Giada's signature dish. Lemon, shrimp pasta. This was one of the best dishes I have ever had! So delicious!! It was a little pricey for the portion but that really is how fine dining is! If you want to splurge on food and or impress a date, take them here!!",

Giada does it right. The only reliance on her celebrity status, other than her name of course, are the episodes from her tv show playing on the tvs over the bar. However, she does not simply rest on her laurels, not the food is impeccably presented, well balanced, and delicious. I found plenty of options to satisfy my vegetarian palate.  The recommendations from our server were on point and the drinks at the bar were just right. We glanced at the drink menus, wine lists and food menu, but in the end we left if to the bar tender and server to select our dishes and we were not disappointed in the least. Perfect service, just right wait time and fantastic meals.  Giada is definitely a hit in Las Vegas.",

The chairs were very stylish but ohhhh so comfortable. We decided to go with the Tasting menu. Which included the appetizers, a pasta, a main meat dish with 4 sides. Then they severed 3 small scoops of sorbet/Gelato to clean the palette. Then they came by with the dessert cart and told us to pick three of them!!!  OMG!!  I chose two and gave the last choice to my dinner companion.   Funny thing the waiter apologized in the beginning and wanted to make sure we knew that their servings were small. It was so much food that I couldn't even eat the side dishes.  LOL  Each time we finished what was in front of us the place setting would be cleared and reset for the next dish. It wasn't just the waiter but a wait staff that took care of you.   This was truly an amazing food and dining experience.",

We started off with pastries and a shareable Antipasti platter of fresh Parmesan cheese with Prosciutto accompanied with fresh honeycomb and mini egg fritatta. The Antipasti was good by itself, but when you mix all the flavors together, the cheese on top of the fritatta, a slice of the prosciutto and drizzle the fresh honey from the honey comb?....your mouth will be singing a delicious tune.  For the main, I got the Salmon Cake Benedict  and my husband ordered the Italian Chicken and Waffles with Cacciatore Sauce.  There is no mistaken that you were eating salmon cakes.  The bread is served on the side of the yummy cakes and the poached egg on top of the salmon was on point.  You crack open that yolk and watch it ooze through the cake.  WOW!!  Let me say that backwards...WOW!!  The cacciatore sauce served with the chicken and waffes was soooo good.  Very tomato-y and fresh tasting that left a clean taste on my palette.  If you asked me what Italian tastes like, I would say Giada's Cacciatore sauce.  That's what Italian tastes like.    Last, but not least, the Leaning Tower of Chocolate & Espresso was decadent and the Limoncello Souffle with Buttermilk Gelato was so luscious and melted in your mouth.  Make this place your next brunch stop when visiting Vegas.",

We didn't realize this until after we'd left though.   There are many vegetarian options and the staff is very accommodating. We requested antipasto without any ham or pork offerings, and they took care to oblige. If you have other dietary needs, I'm sure that they could accommodate most of them.

The dining area has a view of the fountains so you can see them going off.  Was seated promptly and greeted by my server for the evening, Fred. He was phenomenal.   Good wine list with reasonable options in the by the glass section around $14.   I opted to try the tasting menu. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. It had a little bit of everything and was more than enough!  It started with Giadas favorite antipasti. My favorite part was the sweet pepper stuff with a delicious cheese. It was followed by Giadas signature spaghetti in a lemony cream sauce with shrimp. Next course was salmon that was cooked to perfection. It was served with lemon potatoes and a spicy polenta. It was so much good!    Be sure to save room for the dessert cart. It starts with some raspberry sorbet to cleanse the pallet. Small bites for desserts so you're able to try a couple of different things. I opted for the tiramisu and it was delicious.   Definitely worth the trip and should be on your list to try if you haven't gone there!",

    "text": "\"I eat a little bit of Everything and not a lot of Anything\" OMG *gag* 'What a pretentious, snobby, arrogant, anorexic little hosebeast', I thought to myself as I ascended the escalators to the restaurant.    Went on Thursday 3-23-16 at 6:45 PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located inside the Cromwell.  Yeah I've seen the show...but I'm not a big fan.  My husband's uncle is some kinda high roller and got a $500 dining credit to eat here and invited us.  I try to avoid the strip if at all possible but free food lures me in every time.    Thanks to Stefany V. for the tip about parking...to get to self parking you have to go through valet and then make a U-turn.  This is very useful and was totally accurate!!   The scantily-clad hostesses first proudly announced that they had no tables available until 10 pm and then argued a bit before agreeing that there would be a table ready in 15 minutes.  Woah....big difference there, toots.    Took forever to order and get drinks and then took about an hour to get food.  In the meanttime they brought our party of six people a teensy little cutting board with one little piece of bread, some cracker flatbread, and three tiny little hard breadsticks.  For. six. people.  My husband's uncle jokingly asked if there was going to be one of these brought for everybody and the server rolled her eyes.  LOL   The $28 spaghetti, although not a good portion for the price, was very tasty.  The spaghetti had a lovely creamy lemon basil sauce and the noodles were curled into a delicate swirl on top of two very large shrimp that were perfectly cooked.    The romaine salad (cuz' calling it a caesar salad would be too easy I guess) had torn croutons, fried capers & citrus caesar vinaigrette.  The lettuce was crispy and fresh and it had just the right amount of dressing.  It was rather small for the price.  There's a guy who comes around with a pepper grinder the size of a baseball bat and I had one bite of salad left and he asked if I wanted some pepper.  Seriously, dude?? I'm almost done!!!  So just to be a smart ass I said yes and he sprinkled pepper on my last bite of salad.    I tried my husband's wagyu short ribs and OMG it was like the most decadent, tender, pot roast you've ever eaten in your life.  It came with roasted fancy veggies and cheesy grits (although I'm sure Giada would call it polenta LOL) If I ever went back I'd definitely order this.  It was amazing.    So....the food was amazing....the restaurant is really pretty....the food takes forever....but overall it's a good time.  I was so hungry after I left.  Luckily my husband's uncle didn't eat much of his chicken so we took it to-go and ate that when we got home.  If I ever went again I'd probably eat a couple tacos from Jack In the Box before I went.    Dear Giada...just because you don't eat doesn't mean other people don't want to eat!  Increase the portion sizes!!! Especially that stupid bread plate.  It's ridiculously tiny and they should really bring one for every two people at the table.",

We chose dinner at Giada at my wife's suggestion and, given that we were full from a heavier meal earlier in the day, the choice was just right as the ingredients are lighter and the portion sizes smaller.   To begin, we were seated at a couple centric section of the floor plan - I do wish the waiter was a bit more involved in helping us with getting us situated but the menu and our prior knowledge were sufficient guidance. We started with a nice bread plate consisting of fried capers, peppers, olive oil and butter / cream. Delicious start.   As we wanted to keep it light, after ordering mocktails (birdie), we ordered chicken Marsala meatballs (delicious with a great gravy), baby sweet peppers with goat cheese, prawn linguine with a lemon cream sauce, and a margherita pizza. We ended with Giada's famous cookies and cappuccinos (delicious cookies - a classic chocolate chip, lemon drops, and raspberry Nutella chocolate).   Overall, great food that felt right given the day. Ambiance was fun and lively throughout the night. Certainly a recommendation when in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Last Sunday, my friend and I found ourselves at Giada's for brunch.  We arrived around 11 without reservations and we were told they were full until about 1:45.  However, the bar was open seating so we opted for that instead.  I must say, I really loved that the bar had The Food Network playing on the tvs.    Our bartenders, Jeremy and Giovanni, played a big part in making sure our experience was awesome! We asked for their recommendations and I ended up choosing something I wouldn't have normally picked on my own: the Caprese Fritta with Prosciutto.  It was incredible! We also took advantage of their unlimited mimosa brunch special and our bartenders certainly made sure our glasses were never left empty.  In addition, we also tried Giada's Frose, a blended drink made with rose, white vermouth and limoncello.  It was a little too sweet for me but it was definitely worth a try!  Unfortunately, we had saved this stop for our last day in town but I certainly would've gone back to experience more of the menu.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely stop in again!",

Typically, I don't find celebrity chef restaurants to be so great. Usually, they lack in service, depth of flavor, overall ambiance. This was not the case at Giada, and I'll definitely go back when given the choice.",

    "text": "I have plenty of \"favorite\" restaurants, but if I absolutely HAD to choose just one, it would be Giada in Vegas. In honor of Giada's second restaurant, Pronto, opening at Caesar's Palace this weekend, here is my review!   Giada is Italian chef Giada de Laurentiis' first Vegas restaurant, located in the Cromwell hotel on the Strip.   I've eaten here several times, and each time is more amazing than the last.   Giada is great for high-end snacks or happy hour, with its selection of gourmet cheeses and fruit pairings. My favorite one is the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese with wild sage honey, served on toasted Parmesan made into a cracker-like object. Cheese lovers will delight in the Buffalo mozzarella, truffle burrata, gorgonzola dulce, pecorino tartufo and naked goat cheese options, as well.   I'm also a fan of the pizette, even though they are pretty small. The Margherita pizza comes with herb-roasted Campari tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese.   If you're just snacking, other options include the vegetable options (marinated olives, caponata, mushrooms), meat appetizers (orzo meatballs, bacon wrapped dates), seafood, salumi and mustard trays, crostini and soups.   Giada is also a delicious option for dinner, with large serving sizes and delicious flavors at fairly reasonable prices. I'm absolutely obsessed with the arugula salad, which features arugula leaves, candied lemon, Parmigiano-Reggiano and pancetta (I obviously order mine without).   Pasta lovers will rejoice over the options of spaghetti, bucatini with Calabrian chili pomodoro, rigatoni, pappardelle or ravioli. There are also meat and fish options, as well as risotto.  On this occasion, I ordered the smashed and fried lemon potatoes and roasted broccolini (served with Parmesan, roasted garlic and lemon zest). Paired with my salad, it was a delicious meal.   I often want to make trips to Vegas simply so I can eat at Giada. Here's to hoping that Pronto by Giada will be just as delicious!",

    "text": "Nothing disappoints me more than the review I'm about to write. My mom and I had a girls trip to Sin City recently and ate our way through Vegas. We visited some old faves, and tried out some new ones -- and this was not one of them. Believe me, I love Giada as much as the next foodie, so I don't take this 2-star review lightly.  THE GOOD: I loved the decor of the restaurant. It was very Giada-esque. We went for a late lunch, so it was very bright with lots of windows and a great view. You could also see right into the kitchen, which was a nice touch. The table decor was all branded \"Giada\" down to the napkins, place mat and plates. Definitely everything I expected out of her restaurant.  THE BAD: I hate to say it, but the food was just not Food Network chef worthy. It was actually something I could've made at home. After MUCH deliberation, I chose the fritatta and my mom ordered the carbonara pizza. Even though I wanted the prosciutto on my fritatta, I requested it without it since it was a whopping $5 extra. I was surprised (yet not at all upset) when my meal came out topped with prosciutto. I didn't complain, and luckily the waitress didn't even notice and charged us as if I hadn't had it. Despite not being charged for the prosciutto, the bill was still outrageously priced for what we got.   THE UGLY: The waitress and service were awful. It seemed promising at first, but then we stopped getting water refills. And then the waitress came to check on us for the first time... after we had finished eating. Had she checked on us before I ate my entire meal, she may have actually noticed the kitchen got my order wrong.  We walked away disappointed, and questioning whether Giada is really the chef that she and the Food Network claims she is.",

    "text": "So glad Giada chose Vegas for her first restaurant, we welcome her with open arms! This is as good as it gets for a True foodie, and the view and ambiance just add to the great experience. Couple of suggestions: if you go as a group of 4 or more, order a bunch of aps, salads and throw in a few micro pizzas (but pass on mortadella pizza, it was only average), every item offers a different taste, one as good as the next. Then pick a pasta to share, the portion size will be relatively small, but good to share as you still need to get to the main course. We had the pasta in a light sauce with 2 jumbo shrimp, I think it is her signature pasta, it is heavenly, and the T-bone is cut into slices at the table and it is one of the largest cuts of beef I've ever seen served, should be shared by the whole table. Throw a fish dish in, and you have it pretty well covered, but leave room for a bite of dessert, they are all excellent. Top end wine list, recommend those in the Rioja section.  Recommend bringing some sort of coverup for the ladies as it was quite cold where we sat. But that didn't diminish an incredible dining experience. It's going to cost you some cash, but most of the great things in life do.",

My mom and I came in for my birthday and we both did the signature tasting menu. It was a little pricey at $125 per person (for 4 courses) but well worth every penny. However, do be warned that it is a lot of food (antipasto, a full order of pasta, a full entree and then dessert) so go hungry otherwise you will end up taking some home. The lemon prawn spaghetti was unlike anything I had ever had it was simply out of this world. I was unaware that prawns that large existed! I had the farrotto and it was incredible. My mom had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection! Don't even get me started on the dessert cart. Such a lovely experience with so many options to choose from it was overwhelming but delicious. They even wrote happy birthday on the plate. The wine selection is well versed with lots of options to choose from, we had an amazing Italian Pinot Grigio however there was an optional wine pairing with the tasting menu but we chose not to do that. We requested a seat in the window and were not disappointed..the view of the Bellagio fountains was superb! Service was on point and attentive without being too overwhelming. All of the rest of the wait staff was professional and friendly with outstanding knowledge of the menu and where their products come from. Definitely the highlight of our Vegas getaway and we will for sure be repeat customers, the meal was simply life changing.",

We stopped by in the morning and made a reservation for dinner, (thought we got lucky.) I have to say we were all so disappointed that I try not to bring the experience up. My husband claims it ruined the whole weekend for him. The portions are tiny and the prices are huge. Our waiter was much more interested in his table of young girls to the point we had to wait and wait to ask for water refills. Our favorite course was the anti pasta appetizer, but  it went down hill from there. The  tortellini I ordered must have been from the night before, dry and sitting in a pool of olive oi, all 6 of them. I would have been embarrassed to serve this dish!  We left unsatisfied and rather shocked at what we got for the exorbitant prices. The restaurant is indeed beautiful and has an amazing view of the strip. Our waiter was less than attentive and down right rude when we turned down dessert. I would not recommend this restaurant, there are sooooo many better choices in Vegas. Quit frankly I am shocked at how many good review she gets. That certainly was not our experience. We regretted not getting pizza and blowing $500 on the tables instead.",

This was my first time at Giada's and found the restaurant very inviting and pleasant, the view of the strop was magnificent.  The wine dinner was held in one of the private rooms, very comfortable and provided a warm family atmosphere.  The first course consisted of family style platter of several appetizers, a wonderful bacon wrapped date, some tamponade, various olives and several other delectable samples.  The Blanc de Blancs, North Coast 2012 was served with the sample plates--very enjoyable.  The second course was Seared Mediterranean Branzino with Puttanesca Coulis and deconstructed Puttanesca Salad.  This was presented beautifully, the fish had a firm, white, delicate-flavored flesh was roasted and placed atop a delicious Puttanesca Coulis--a wonderful garbanzo bean puree with spices.  Alongside the fish was a simple green salad.  I enjoyed this dish very much, the wine parred was J. Schram, North Coast 2006--this was magnificent with this course.  The third course presented two pasta dishes, Three Cheese Tortellini with Salsa Genovese and family style Rigatoni with Vegetable Bolognese.  The tortellini were delicate and the meat sauce was the Wagyu Short Rib trimmings and provided a great depth to the wonderful dish.  The Rigatoni had a mushroom based sauce which was very good.  The wine parred with this was Pinot Noir, Davies, Nobles Vineyard, Sonoma Coast, 2012 and was fabulous.  The entree presented was a Barolo braised Wagyu Short Rib with Smashed Lemon Potatoes and soft Polenta.  This was extremely delicious, the short rib was very tender, flavorful and almost melted in my mouth.  The polenta and smashed lemon potatoes added a nice balance to the rich meat.  This course was parred with Cabernet Sauvignon, J. Davies, Diamond Mountain, Napa Valley, 2012--and was superb.  The dessert course was a Polenta Cake with Strawberry jam and Mascarpone cream, amazing flavors, simple yet very elegant.  This was parred with Cremant Demi-Sec, Napa Valley, 2011.  The entire dinner and the wines were excellent and I enjoyed the great service, food and wines.  This was a marvelous event.",

Our server was fair and answered questions quickly but as it turns out, I dont think she really knew what she was talking about.  I ordered a muffuletta, asked if it was served warm and told that it was not.  I requested that it be nuked a bit and after she checked with the kitchen she told me it couldn't because it was pre- prepared!!!   I persisted and ordered the sandwich, but was not able to eat it.   It was taken off my bill.   A friend ordered the tuna on focaccia and stated that it was dry.   Two friends ordered salads.  There was no bread offered on the table nor served with the salads.  We were not offered a dessert tray to view.   We asked to see the manager and expressed our opinions.   He was apologetic.    We are local so will offer our view to all our friends.   We were eager to experience the restaurant, but we're sadly disappointed.  It will be quite a while before we try this restaurant again",

    "text": "My mom and I were visiting Vegas and were looking forward to our meal at Giada's as we both love her cooking.  We were seated quickly upon arrival and the decor and ambiance was beautiful.  Our waitress Karina came over to us and let us know her and George would be taking care of us today.  She asked if we wanted anything other than water but we both declined as all we wanted was water due to the hot Vegas weather.  She seemed extremely annoyed that all we wanted was water.  We then were left to look at the menu, and decide what we wanted...for about 20 minutes before Karina returned again, asking us what we decided on.  At that point my mom and I asked her to explain the menu and let us know what her recommendations were.  The disgust on her face was enough to make me want to leave, she went through the menu while looking like she wanted to do anything other than help us.  Meanwhile, we were watching the waiter Michael, who had the tables around us great everyone, explain the menu and his picks and help everyone pick out a meal.  We then decided on some pizza's, salads and olives.  After we ordered, we didn't see Karina again until she brought us our check.  Our water was never refilled, we couldn't find anyone to refill it, our food was brought by someone else which in most upscale restaurants it is, but Karina never even came by to see how we liked our meal.  We were treated like we didn't belong there, and it ruined the meal and the whole experience.  When they give you your check they also give you an iPhone to fill out a survey about your experience and leave a name and number so they can contact you.  I left this similar review with my name and number and was never contacted.  Overall, the food was amazing but not worth the money or time due to the terrible service we received.  We visit Vegas often and we will never be back again, and I'll be sure to spread the word with family, friends and/or strangers about how badly they treat their customers.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of Giada and could not wait to go to this restaurant. We made a reservation to go there on a Sunday evening for 7 people. We were greeted in a very friendly manner by the hostess who suggested we go to the bar before our complete party arrived. We ordered drinks at the bar- the Hannibal being my favorite as well as the Giada. The manager greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant - exceptional attention and concern for guests. We were seated at our table and were then greeted by our waiter who had exceptional knowledge of the menu while he walked us through everything and gave recommendations of what to order. Staff is very attentive and brings whatever you need to the table in a very professional manner. We started with the bacon wrapped dates, mushrooms, soup, and a meat plate. Everything was in small portions but absolutely delicious. The main dishes did not disappoint either- lobster ravioli, lemon shrimp pasta ( my favorite) risotto, tortellini, etc were all exceptional. Dessert came on a cart and the waitress explained all the options to us. The cookies, tiramisu, cappuccino and coffee drink with nutella were all completely amazing! If you go here be prepared to know that portions are small and the meal is meant to be in stages like Giada would have at a dinner at her house. The personal touches in the restaurant complete the experience and the open windows give the restaurant an open feel. Overall I loved this place. It is a little pricey but for quality ingredients and service. This is probably the nicest restaurant I have been to and perfect for special occasions. I loved it and hopefully will go back in the future!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I wanted to LOVE this place. In fact, it was one of the main reasons we travelled to Vegas. Giada is one of my favorite food network chefs. When we arrived the restaurant the ambiance was beautiful. The photo booth was a great touch and the staff was amazing. However, that's all it was. To start my husband ordered pasta fagioli soup and I had a arugula salad. The salad was good and a nice size portion, however the soup portion was a disgrace. I understand the concept of small plating but I don't even think there was a ladle of soup in his bowl. A bowl of soup is not something you order to share and in my honest opinion I think they should be embarrassed by the portion of soup they serve. For our entrees my husband ordered the Filet and I had the salmon. He ordered a side of lemon potato's and I had a side of crispy polenta. My husband said his filet was very good and the sides were very good as well. My salmon was very bland. On to dessert.... They come around with a cart and you choose off of the cart what you would like. I ordered a blackberry, lemon tiramisu and my husband got a strawberry tart. Again very small portions for the prices and nothing special. I also ordered a nutella espresso. It was supposed to be two shots of espresso, nutella, hazelnuts and whipped cream. This barley consisted of espresso and I'm a little perplexed how they passed this off as a drink because all it had was nutella, whip cream and a DROP of espresso. $250 later this meal wasn't as good as any of the other restaurants we went too during our stay. In fact it was on the bottom of the spectrum. Lavo's food was way better and Tao's salmon blew the salmon I had at Giada's out of the water. I think this restaurant is going to be a one hit wonder for a lot of people. Giada fans will try it but likely not return. Its a lot like a pretty woman, dressed to the nine and a face full of make up with no personality... Pretty to look at, but no substance. I don't know about everyone else, but I go to a restaurant for good food, not just a pretty room. The next day there was nothing memorable about this meal or food.",

    "text": "I just realized something- Folks... as tempting as it might be to tell everyone how amazing the meal is here-- we are only making it more difficult for ourselves to come back and get reservations next time.  Perhaps we should \"modify\" our reviews with more restraint so everyone doesn't catch on and swarm this place for the next 5 years? You know... instead of 5 stars and phrases like, \"OMG! It was all so amazing!\" we could tone it down to... \"uh...it' was okay, if you are into to awesome food and all that. Meh. I mean, sure it looked and tasted good, and the location was great... and Giada was gracious and lovely, but really... who cares about such things?\"  You know, add a tone of ennui to our reviews to keep everyone else away before we never get a chance to come back.  Just a thought.  By the way- the Vermentino goes excellent with the lemon shimp spaghetti, and the Leviathin red wine goes perfect with the lamb.  So-- back to my point- Stop promoting this place or we'll never be able to get a reservation. Let's make this Las Vegas' best kept SECRET! :-) Muhahahahahahaahaha! *evil laugh* ...and keep it all to ourselves!",

    "text": "This place was a huge letdown.  Made a reservation through their front desk hostess and specified Sunday brunch, 11:00.  Based on Giada's website,  which I checked again before going that morning, it reads \"Breakfast and lunch daily 9:00-2:15pm\".  Neither menu posted on their website specified a time differential for each.  We showed up 15 minutes early for the reservation and they made us wait until 11 to be seated, even though less than half the restaurant was full.  When we were seated we were only given a lunch menu.  After 15 minutes of waiting at the table,  I grabbed a passing hostess and asked her for the breakfast menu.  She said they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00  so I asked for our waiter.  He finally showed up 5 minutes later and said he would check with the manager.  She came over and said breakfast was not available after 11:00 so I reminded her of their website menus/times posted and she said she checked with chef and he said there were no more breakfasts left (are they making them in advance?  or they ran out of eggs?  either way it's not so good).  She did apologize and brought us some free Prosecco's.  Our waiter finally appeared a second time to give us some water, 25 minutes after we were seated, so we placed our full order right away as we feared we may never see him again.  The food was just ok and overpriced even for a strip restaurant.  I had to grab a passing busboy for a to-go box and again later to ask for our check because our waiter was NEVER around.  Have to say their service was the worst I've experienced in town.",

    "text": "Exquisite food, Exquisite space, operations need help! Working out kinks? Too many gimmicks? Expect perfection with the hype? All of the above. Was so excited to try as Giada food style is perfect to my taste and I was not disappointed in a single thing I ate. Where my experience went wrong is in the human interactions-waiter needs an assistant or more interest as \"Ready to order\" or \"finished\" were about all that I heard-no effort to explore the menu, assist a vegan diner with options-contrary to web site, no offer of a second cocktail, coffee, after dinner drink. No explanation of the dessert cart and how it works-a point out of the items but price? Do you order 1? tasting option? Ipad options were distracting in that they either didn't work well or I'm not tech enough. Commented to waiter about a burning smell and he said \"yeah, its the wood burning in the ovens-I take a shower when I get home and cant get the smell off but need the job\". The  manager types who stopped by seemed self serving and not really interested in hearing \" my wine glass is empty and would order another if someone came by or asked\".  Felt like the \"Experience of dining\" was lessened by what seemed like turning tables-but the food was sublime and the kitchen has its A game. Perhaps the novelty and kinks will work out when people have been there and done that-but more human and less shtick- as part of what drives people to a place like this is the human connection we want to have with the real Giada- as well as the experience of special dining.",

    "text": "Recently dined at \"Giada\" and was disappointed with the food and service.  The evening started out at the bar with a $17.00 small glass of uninspired Pinot Noir for me and a $10.00 imported beer for my husband.  We were a party of six, and I must say we were seated quickly in the rather noisy dining area.  The service here is slow, and pre-dinner cocktails took a long time in coming.  We ordered an antipasta plate which was OK but ordinary....however the price was astronomical! The salads were good, but the worst part came when the entrees......didn't all arrive at the same time.  Three people in our party did not receive their entrees, and since we were all raised right, we all waited 20 min. until they appeared to begin eating. Naturally they were cold, and I found the pasta in my lemon spaghetti rather soggy.  My husband had the pork ragout, which had a peculiar burnt taste and left him with a queasy stomach later in the evening.  The crowning touch came with the bill, the amount of which could fed an average family of 20, providing they ate at a reasonable restaurant. I am from Charleston SC originally, where there are very expensive restaurants as well. However, the food, service and atmosphere at these eateries are usually impeccable. Not so at Giada's ! Needless to say, we will not be back. In parting..... Never trust a skinny chef or her restaurant!",

That alone will bring me back next time I'm in Vegas. The food was good, I got the rigatoni and was satisfied. Others in my party loved their food. I would have opted for the spaghetti next time. I loved my drink - 'la strada.' Downsides - There was a lot of time between courses and drinks, as in we were there for 3 hours. We did not feel rushed at all which was nice, but we had arrived by a very, very early flight that morning and I would have been fine shaving an hour off that time. The hostesses were horrible. There were about 6 of then behind the desk when we arrived and they barely greeted us except to ask about a reservation which we did have. They pointed us to the photo booth and did not look or talk to us for the next 20-30 minutes while we waited. They also did not say a word to us when we walked out which after such amazing service by the entire wait staff was really disappointing. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "We dined here last night for a early valentine's day celebration.   As locals working in the industry you very rarely celebrate anything on the actual day. When first arriving to the restaurant we noticed how beautifully decorated the hotel and entrance to the restaurant was.  If you remember what Bill's was before you would agree how much of a face lift this place got.  We checked out the photo booth before dinner since we got there 5 mins before our reso and they didn't seat us right away.  As we walked out of the booth the hostess told us our table was ready but not to worry about the pictures cuz it was out of paper to print them.   Why wouldn't you put a sign up or something so guests know to email the photos to themselves?   Or not take the pictures at all.  Whatever!  We followed the hostess to what seemed like the back corner of the restaurant.  The table she tried to seat us at was literally in the corner with a deuce so close to it we might as well have had dinner with the couple next to us and been a party of 4.  I asked her if any other table would be available.   She had us wait in the lounge while she went back to check.  We didn't mind the wait, about 15-20 mins, ordered a cocktail to start.  Great selling tactic if it was one!  Taylor, the hostess, came back to escort us to a table by the window overlooking the fountains.  She was super friendly and accomadating!  Honestly her willingness to help us was probably the highlight of our night.  Once at the table our server came over and greeted us, presented a wine list and dinner menu.  He took a moment to explain the menu and some signature dishes.  The gm came over and interrupted him during his spiel, said hi to us, said something to the server, and then walked away.  Weird.   (And he never touched the table after that)  I was torn between a couple different items and asked the server what he would recommend.   He didn't seem as if he wanted to answer my questions.  Almost as if we were bothering him.   We ended up ordering the orzo meatballs, bacon wrapped dates, burrata, and the tricolore salad to start.  They were all good, nothing spectacular.   The bread selection was good though.   We wanted to order a bottle of wine but had a couple questions for the sommelier.   He was tied up at another table and we didn't get a chance to order the wine until we were done with our apps.  A little disappointing.   In his defense the apps did come out quite quickly.  But still, no one likes to be rushed.  The weird thing was the apps came out super quick but we waited a long time for our entrees.   For our entrees I got the spaghetti, her signature dish.   It had these huge prawns with lemon and capers.  It sounds better on paper than it was.  My bf had the pasta with the pork ragout.   Both dishes were very bland.  We had to add salt and red pepper flakes from the bread presentation to spice it up.  I hate to say it but we were super disappointed.   We had heard so many good things about this place but didn't have anything good for ourselves.  They have this dessert cart that you see going around that apparently is only for the patrons who ordered the tasting menu.  So don't get your hopes up when you see it unless you have the tasting menu.  We ordered the cookies for dessert since nothing really jumped out at us.  They were unique.   Not soon after we dug into the cookies our server dropped the check.  Obviously he had someplace else to be and we were in his way!  Overall we were disappointed.  Not to mention once the bottle of wine was opened we had to keep pouring it ourselves.  Maybe $100 bottle of wine is too cheap to have any sort of table maintenance.   The server hardly came by to check on us.  Maybe we were just to critical of the place or maybe they were having an off day.  But none the less, with so many great options in this city Giadas will not be at the top of our list.  Sometimes people that work in the same industry are much more critical than others.  Or maybe not, who really knows.",

Although the food and atmosphere is great, our waiter was completely rude and dismissive. We celebrated my husband's birthday and spent $280, but the waiter made us feel as if we weren't ordering enough despite ordering drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert. He rarely came to check on us. Our calamari appetizer was slimy and smelled fishy, so we sent it back and he was annoyed. When we ordered dessert, they did not offer us coffee/tea and never did anything for his birthday despite mentioning it. It takes minimal effort to stick a candle in a dessert. We also had to flag down our waiter to receive the check after waiting 20 minutes just to have a different person bring the check back and thank us for coming. Although I love Giada, I feel that there are plenty of other options on the Strip at this price point where they have proper management and staff that knows how to run a restaurant. I would be happy to speak to management regarding my experience if  they were to reach out. It's also impossible to get a hold of anyone at this restaurant to complain!",

The restaurant looks very nice, but it was overly loud including the street noise.  We couldn't even hear our waiter describe things on the menu.  They gave us an iPad for the drinks/wine list that was very slow to scroll through the pages.  The sampling appetizer dish was good, but nothing spectacular.  The  Paste e Fagioli soup was very bland.  The biggest disappointment was all of our entrees. Everything was EXTREMELY SALTY, the bone-in Tuscan Rib-eye was cooked well but none of us could take a second bit without gulping down a glass of water.  Same is said for their pizza.  The highly recommended Spaghetti with shrimp wasn't any better, the shrimp was overcooked to the point that it was hard to cut.  Everyone took 2 bites of their food.  We pointed this out to the waiter and he insisted that the manager should be informed of the problem. Once we told the manager of the problem, he just gave us a nod in agreement, and all he offered to do was to give us dessert and walked away.  He did not offer to remake, replace, or asked us what we wanted.  We struggled through dinner only to decide that it wasn't even worth our time to stay and try their desserts.  Bad service, horrible food, don't think we'll come back here.",

    "text": "Had great expectations for this restaurant and was highly disappointed.  Arrived early and sat in the lounge.  My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence.  I had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink.  WTH!  Was seated at our table at the time of our reservation. The server told us that we could NOT order an appetizer first, that we must order our entire meal to include wine at one time, end of discussion.  Okay we make our choices and order about 10 minutes later.  Still no bread.  Wait about 15 minutes for appetizers, they are brought.  Then finally some bread is brought out.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the olives and they were meh!  The warm bread was covered in salt, so much so that my husband the sodium freak said it was too much for him.  I had the shrimp with spaghetti while my spouse had the lamb.  My pasta was clumpy and overcooked as were the two shrimp I received with it.  My husband's lamb was ordered medium rare and was received as  well done.  Both appetizers lacked seasoning and we were not offered any  parmesan for the pasta or salt/pepper for any of our food.  On a side note, the portions are incredibly  small.  My sister lives in Vicenza Italy and I thave traveled there on a frequent basis for the past 30 years, 3-4 times a year and this is not Italian food or service.  The waiter asked how we were enjoying our meal and we told him.  No one from management approached us.  We did not order dessert because the majority of it appeared dried out.  My husband did order coffee for after dinner.  This was a total waste of our time and money.",

We started with the marinated calamari that was cool and refreshing in the Las Vegas heat, and the charred octopus that was so tender and made even better by sprinkling the Provided finishing salt over top. We also had to order the salumi with hints of truffle that was also amazing. For the main entree we had the whole roasted chicken cacciatore. It was the Best roasted chicken I've ever had! Perfectly crispy skin yet juicy meat that wasn't over cooked. The seasoning was spot on as well. Every bite was full of flavor! The wait staff and even the managers were attentive and went out of their way to make our dining experience special, which says a lot about Giada's attention to detail. It was such an enjoyable experience that we didn't want to rush. We took over 3 hours savoring every mouthful and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My family and I had lunch at Giada this past Saturday. Despite hearing mixed reviews, I was excited to check it out. I mean, that view, Italian food and bright-eyed Giada backing it? This is going to be awesome! Everything seemed promising when we arrived - cute photo booth (win!), no wait for our table (we made reservations) and a great booth near the windows. And a super friendly waiter to boot.   Alas, it was all downhill from there.   After a lengthy explanation from our waiter about how Giada encouraged family sharing, (I mean, it's on her lampshades as was pointed out to us), we drank the kool-aid and decided to order her intended-for-sharing antipasti plates. They came out in laughably minuscule portions. Unless your family hates food, these sharing plates are NOT family sized by any means. Look, we're not a heffer-sized family. But $14-$20 For a tiny ramekin of mushrooms and an even smaller portion of meatballs?! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FNope.com&s=9b1d322dcb153a6a6898a2f703a528fef8258394525a0aa03e1f17f9819ea0cd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nope.com</a>. Fine, lesson learned. Onto the main..  Tragically, not great either. I ordered the sweet onion carbonara - I love me a good carbonara and this just wasn't it. Lukewarm and small-portioned. Pancetta, cream, onions and tube pasta. Call me a purist, but throw in a pea or two. At least pretend like you tried. The actual plate was hotter than the dish. My husband ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese. Dry, lukewarm and small portioned. (The fried zucchini fries on the side saved the dish.)  but the lobster roll that my dad ordered was delicious. Rich and decadent. (Or it could be that we were all starving so we descended on the poor man's lobster roll like a walking dead hoard.)  Giada has these giant yard-long pepper shakers that they use tableside to much bravado. I don't mind it- it's The Vegas touch. The irony being that none of that badly needed seasoning made it to our table. Our waiter disappeared and I had to flag down another waiter who annoyedly grabbed pepper ( right next to our table) and hurriedly serviced our table.   Look, I don't like to write mean reviews, but when you already know you're going to pay a premium at \"celebrity\" restaurants in Vegas, then those restaurants should try to make an effort to earn your cash. We went to a bunch of restaurants that weekend (Mizumi at Wynn, DB Brasserie at Venetian, Twist at Mandarin Oriental)- and they all far outshined Giada.  I like you Giada - you're cute, you make good food on TV and although you way overpronounce your Italian words sometimes (you're Italian, we get it.), you're likable. Just wish your restaurant was as likable.",

    "text": "Giada! I am sorry to say good network hype! Maybe your a figure on tv but your restaurant has a completely different interpretation and representation of what we were hoping to experience. When we arrived we sat in the bar for cocktails Caitlin was our server I will say she was great! However that was the only part of this experience that was worth going for. The drinks were nice. They seated us for dinner and unfortunately we were in for a complete disappointment. I understand aldente cooked pasta right however a little to undercooked in my opinion. We chose the tasting menu. The pasta that was recommended to me tasted like \"Chef boy \"r\" dee\" and I am embarrassed to say yes I have tasted spaghetti \"o's!\" After that course was trying to get rid of I noticed our main course being delivered but halted by our waitress and sent back to the kitchen because that last course wasn't cleared yet. After the spaghetti \"O's\" were cleared the main course came. I ordered rack of lamb rare to medium rare it had sat under a salamander oven along with my wife's salmon both were way over cooked and bland! I want to warn others who are blinded by the beauty of what good network has done to glorify this celebrity chef. Her food looks greater on tv but you might be in for a surprise as we were that our Four hundred dollar bill could have been save by staying at home and eating spaghetti for a can. This is sad to me however I will let others know go somewhere else like Michael Mina, Daniel Bould, Thomas Keller if you want a real dinning experience with a celebrity chef! Sorry Giada but you need to get back in the kitchen and see for yourself! Diners beware and good luck in Vegas this is a losing bet!",

From the bread, which was served with special dry dippers including salted Parmesan to the dessert, we chose the souffle w buttermilk gelato, we were moaning in ecstasy. We tried the calamari, which was the freshest I've ever had. We also started with the crostini with the roasted Brussels sprouts. We knew then we'd made a perfect choice. For our entrees I had the ravioli and my husband had the risotto. If it wasn't a nice place I'd probably have licked my plate. If this place was back home, we'd try everything on the menu, in fact it took restraint not to return the next night. We will be back every time we are in Vegas!!!",

The salad was romaine with Caesar dressing with a hint of lemon...not one of my favorites.  My husband's meal consisted of the veal chop, which was decent, but the sauce was not his favorite.  My choice was the spaghetti with shrimp.  While my food was flavorful, it was lukewarm when served.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I love Giada, but the restaurant needs a little help!  Not worth the $$$.",

(The main dining room has a great vibe and view but there is Strip traffic noise. Music should be lowered and more subtle.) The food was delicious and they accommodated a couple of special requests well. The lemon ricotta cookies are a must! We already downloaded the recipe from Food Network. The service was almost there...we experienced a couple of lags between courses and had to request a couple of things (soup spoon, sugar, etc.). For these prices it is a treat when the servers anticipate your needs. We had a nice night and send thanks for the special room!",

We had bacon-wrapped dates, orzo meatballs, The lemon spaghetti with shrimp was tasty, the pasta cooked perfectly.  Rack of lamb is not my favorite, but it was also delicious-- not gamey, like I was expecting.  Here was my favorite part:  the dessert cart.  We got to choose 3 each of the array of sweets, from gelato to cookies to pastry.  The most homely looking dessert-- it appeared to be no frills next to the nipples of venus and the elephant ears-- was a polenta cake.  OMIGOSH-- I wish I could have eaten the whole thing-- it just blew me away.  An incredible night, a wonderful meal.  A high recommend.",

Then after she hangs up she asks how many we say two she says it will be 10 mins or so ok we have no problem with that except when we finally did get seated there were only about a dozen people in the place and lots of empty seats. Our server was very attentive and helpful. Very limited menu. I get it do a few things and do them all well !  I ordered the Muffuletta with zucchini do dads ??? Wife ordered the pesto grill cheese with arugula salad. About 5 minutes or so went by and the server comes to our table and let's me know they are out of the Muffuletta would I like the menu to make another choice. Well there is not much to choose from so I just go with the grilled cheese and added prosciutto.  They served our food and wife had zucchini do dads not a salad the zucchini things were not good at all tasted like fish from dirty oil and it was like trying to eat and untangle shoestrings anyway so I left mine on the plateSo again several minutes go by and they bring her a salad.  The sandwiches were just OK no real wow factor that's all I can say. 22 bucks for grilled cheese ( welcome to Vegas ) while eating we saw a Walburgers over our shoulder sure wished we had choose that for lunch.",

    "text": "Went to Giada's for our anniversary.  We had an early reservation and still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated and they had just opened for dinner.   The photo booth was a fun touch but the only reason we knew there was one was from reading these reviews.    While the view of the Strip is nice if you have a window view, the restaurant itself is rather nondescript.   The service was average, there were long periods of sitting and waiting for the wait staff and then periods when they were very attentive.  However, the bus staff was working non-stop.  They need to pay more attention to the little details.  For a higher end dining establishment I was disappointed to have my $15 cocktail served in an extremely water spotted glass.  The table should be cleaned periodically of crumbs and they need to watch reaching in front of the diner to remove items from the table while they are eating.  The food was good but over priced for what you get.  We tried the Tasting Menu and afterwards realized it would have been cheaper to buy the items individually.  I think you pay for the recipes and autographed Giada picture as well as the meal.  Our favorite items were the pasta dishes.  Her lemon spaghetti with prawns is delicious.  But be aware that if you try too many of Giada's favorites you may be overwhelmed by lemon as she uses it a lot.  Overall, we were underwhelmed.  We've eaten at high end steak houses that were less expensive.   While we were not blown away by our entire dining experience, we would go back as there are several items on the menu that we would like to try.",

They have cheese courses but they're not served with anything. A big blob of cheese in the middle of a board and some small crumbly things next to it. The Parmesan was just chunks of Parmesan on a plate. Four little chunks of Parmesan and nothing else. The bacon wrapped dates were very good. My husband enjoyed the risotto with scallops. But in my opinion it's overpriced and the portions are ridiculously small. I understand fine dining small but this was a little crazy. if I had to go back I would stick to the appetizer menu. Cocktails were very small and very expensive. The service was great though.",

I lived in Rome, IT for a while, and I finally feel like I've had the authentic Italian food I've been yearning for all these years! There was a moment in time where I welled up with tears, got goosebumps, and my friend and I couldn't even speak to each other, because we were in awe! This Italian girl from Portland, OR would fly to Vegas again just to eat at Giada's. I highly reccommend the Tasting Menu! It's worth every penny! The appetizers were outstanding, the rigatoni with vegetable bolognese was out of this world, and the limoncello ricotta cheesecake and almond polenta cake were phenomenal! The foccacia bread served with accoutrements of lemon marscapone butter, deep fried capers, pesto, sea salt, and pepper flakes could have been a meal in it of itself. TO DIE FOR!! I will be talking about this meal for years to come. David was our server, and what a joy he was. He has an incredible personality and made us feel so welcomed and important! Grazie Mile Giada's Restaurant! Spero di viaggiare per il ristorante di nuovo a presto!!",

    "text": "My husband and I decided  on Sunday to go Giadas. I am a fan of Giada's TV show.  We arrived about noontime.  We did not have a reservation and we were told by the not so friendly reception desk the wait would be 45 minutes (they seemed annoyed we did not have a reservation ) but 10 minutes later we were seated to a not so full restaurant. I guess because we did not have a reservation we were seated in the hallway part of the restaurant against a wall where there was food splatter all over the wall papered wall and the wood floors are severely scratched up. The very nice waitress came over to take our drink order. I wanted a bloody mary one of their \"specialty drinks\" and we were told they were all out of it (what?) okay another strike but we are very tolerant and still okay with it.  For appetizers we shared the orzo meatballs and margherita pizza.  The pizzas flavor was good but the dough was very chewy. I did not care for the meatballs or the sauce. Also for $15.00 you get  the tiniest meatballs I have ever seen. Our entree was lasagna and pasta carbonara. NO BREAD was served! The pasta carbonara was very good but the portion again is quite small ($24.00!). My husband had the lasagna and this came in a very small ramekin like dish and was just okay ($24.00!) The portions are very very small so eat before you get here. We had Gelato for dessert and this was excellent and is why I was generous with the 3 star review. $100.00 bill and still hungry! It sounded like we ordered a lot of food but even when i asked the waiter if it would be too much she said no and boy was she right. On the way out there were 3 employees standing at the reception and not one acknowledged us by saying thank you or have a nice day. Too many better choices on the strip. I hate giving bad reviews but we were disappointed.",

    "text": "Review for wedding reception on December 29th, 2014.   Giada was given as one of a few ideas for the venue of our wedding reception. Our group was planned to be about 10-20 people. My fiance and I had great misgivings about the restaurant based on reviews we read on this site. However, about deliberations with our parents their wishes won out and we chose this restaurant.  In the sprit of full disclosure, we made a reservation 4-5 months in advance back in the summer. We attempted to make the reservation through Caesar's booking, and our experience here was terrible. We played phone tag and musical chairs with numerous people trying to book. Very weak service and little to no responses were the norm. We managed to finally get the booking, but still had doubts as to whether it was final and received no response from the person who made the reservation. Still we planned for the wedding reception to take place at the restaurant. We had been told we had a private room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. More on this later.  When we arrived in Vegas, we made a trip over to the restaurant on the day before the wedding to ensure our reservation. After speaking to the manager, we were told our parties would be in the general seating area, not together, and waited on as if we were walk-ins. When told this was not what we asked for and would not work, the manager grew irritated. Finally, we were able to work it out to have the private room in the back behind the bar, with dedicated wait staff and a complimentary champagne toast and gift books for the couple.  On the night of the reception, we arrived in the restaurant and were seated promptly. The back room has no windows, but we didn't mind as it gave us a chance to talk and carry on as only an Irish wedding party could. The bride enjoyed the Animal cocktail, and the Groom had several of the Giada special cocktail, as well as a Flash Gordon. All are to be recommended. Drink flowed and so did the blarney, until the food came out.  And what a meal it was! 5-6 courses over the course of 3 hours (6:30 to 9:30; I'm a little hazy on the number of courses because like I said, Irish). The first was an olive and cheese plate with little peppers and a delectable burrata cheese. The second were an antipasto plate. The third, small plates of meat. By this point I was already stuffed, and we weren't even halfway through the meal  The fourth, pasta, including a cheesy spaghetti with shrimp. The fifth was by far the best, with racks of tenderloin steak cooked perfectly, scallops, and roast chicken with a cacciatore on the side. Finally, a deliciously decadent dessert course topped the night. We cleansed our pallets with a salute of lemoncella.   The wait staff we had that night were courteous, prompt, and extremely professional. The manager the night of the reception took exceptional care of us.   Our experience may not be the same as others. We had a large party, a private room, time to kill, and were ready to pay for the most expensive dinner option. Despite the difficulties in the planning of the dinner, the meal itself was exquisite, the service excellent, and all went away from the dinner that night having experienced a once-in-a-lifetime feast.  What other choice is there but five stars?",

After I asked the waitress for the bread, she told me that I have to waited 10 minutes for it. This is crazy, she should ask me if I want the bread or not at the time she took my order. Bad: Roasted mushroom--$14.00 serving size 2 oz. Muffuletta---$16.00 bread is too hard and dry. Quarter the size of what I can get in New Orlean for $8.00 Pasta of the day--$24.00 plain pasta with tomato sauce serving size 6 oz.  If you need an expensive snack, go for it.",

It's an amazing place to people watch during dinner.  ...and when they open the windows in the evening, it kicks it up another notch or two!  The food was all very tasty.  My only complaint was the portion sizes were a little smaller than I would have preferred.  After sharing a couple appetizers, soup, main course and desert - I was still hungry (and I'm not a big guy).  Granted, the food tasted so good that it left me wanting more anyway!   Will I repeat?  As a local I will have to think hard on that one.  It's one of those places that you can take out of town guests to and know that the food will be amazing - so yeah, I probably will repeat.  But I went hoping that it would be my new regular favorite place - and so I'm torn because the food tasted great, but I'd almost need to order two entrees to be full.",

The food is outstanding. I had the egg frittata with shaved prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, basil and heirloom tomatoes. And the side of rustic italian ciabatta with lemon butter was divine.",

While waiting for our table reservation to be ready we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple glasses of wine and the goat cheese stuffed peppers appetizer which was DELICIOUS, we could have done 10 more orders!!!  The menus we presented on iPads which was kinda cool and unique.   Once our table was ready we closed out at the bar and headed to our table (which would have been nice closer to see the strip view but still a nice spot). We were greeted within minutes buy a very friends Italian waiter (I forgot his name :( ) We wanted to try everything on the menu but we will have to save that for future visits! :) wait time wasn't too bad and we got to enjoy this DELICIOUS olive oil and Rosemary bread while waiting.... Everything we had was awesome!! Service was excellent, waters were continuously refilled, plates were cleared when we were finished and we were well attended to all night! Can't wait to return!! I'll attach some photos for your viewing pleasure!! Good job Giada!  With a 20% well deserved tip and all our check was only around 300$. I think very good price for everything we had!",

    "text": "After a weeks' long stay in Las Vegas, the one meal that is most memorable is the one I had at Giada.  Even against the Michelin-rated restaurant we went to on our first night.  Maybe it's the familiarity of Italian food, the comfy coziness you come to expect from a really good pasta, or maybe it's Giada herself.  Either way, I loved this restaurant, the service, and most importantly, THE FOOD.  We decided to go with the tasting menu - may or may not have something to do with the free autographed picture of Giada and recipe cards that come with it.  Whatever the case, I thought we made a pretty good choice.  It started with an antipasti platter.  This included small bites of a stuffed sweet pepper, tuna crostini, and a bacon wrapped date.  All of them were quite tasty, the tuna especially.  Second course was the most heavenly and delicious lemon spaghetti with shrimp.  I seriously could have just stopped right here and been perfectly happy.  The pasta was homemade, which is a huge, huge plus.  Delicate lemon cream sauce and two large shrimp.  We were told it was a smaller portion of pasta, but it was plenty big if you ask me.  I hated giving most of it back as I knew if I finished it, I wouldn't be able to eat anything more.  Luckily, one of the recipe cards we received was for this dish, and my husband and I are so excited to make it at home.  Third course was a seared salmon atop a bed of summer succotash in a light mustard sauce.  The salmon is cooked medium rare by default, which I know is the ideal temp for salmon.  However, the server was quite aware that not everyone in the world is okay with eating what appears to be something undercooked.  He informed me of this ahead of time, which I appreciated.  I asked for a medium salmon, and that is exactly what I got.  To me, it was PERFECT.  It wasn't over the top on seasonings, but somehow it was extremely flavorful.  Light, flaky and paired perfectly with the succotash and sauce.  Again, I had to send most of it back because I was getting too full at this point and I didn't want to miss out on dessert.  My husband got the lamb, and he enjoyed it very much.  We also received this dish as a recipe card, so I'm sure we will be having lamb at our house in the near future.  Accompanying the entrees were two family-style sides: smashed potatoes (glorious!) and a sweet corn wth chorizo.  I loved both of these.  They are the epitome of comfort food to me.  Another thing I could have just eaten all by itself and been perfectly happy.  Last course was dessert.  They bring over an unwieldy, awkward cart filled with about 10 or so different things.  We were seated in a narrow space with tables on either side, so I have no idea how this cart ever made it over to us.  I was so full by this point that dessert didn't even sound good, but we split a peanut butter/raspberry jam tiramisu anyway.  It was surprisingly light and very satisying.  It was a small, single portion so if you're on the verge of unbuttoning your pants at the table, I think this item will be just enough dessert for you.  We did get one of the chocolate cake things to go.  And then didn't proceed to eat it until the next night.  It didn't taste all that great, but that could've been cuz it sat in a plastic container for over 24 hours.  I really had a great time at Giada and would 100% go back if we were locals and had the opportunity to do so.  I've already recommended this restaurant to several friends, and of course it is one of the highlights of my vacation recap.  To anyone trying to decide where to eat while visiting Las Vegas, all I can say is GIADA, GIADA, GIADA!  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  When the gigantic, hydraulic-controlled windows are swung open, letting in a faint breeze & noises from the strip two floors below, it is a real treat to sit at the restaurant's perimeter. Nearing closing time, the windows were slammed shut, & there went all of our ambiance (literally out the window.) Something about the lovely natural elements detracted from the air-con, set to full blast, & the overly simplistic decor which lacked character. Weather permitting, keep them windows open!  The dessert cart rolled by several times, tempting me. When I finally tried all three cookies (lemon, chocolate chip/ricotta, PB with blackberry jam), a bite of blueberry eclair, & a spoonful of dark chocolate amaretti cake, I was disappointed that they had tasted no better than a run-of-the-mill buffet dessert (at triple the cost.)   Two appetizers stood out as phenomenal: bacon-wrapped dates were sticky & plump, and crostini w/ ricotta, honey, lemon, & pink peppercorns were addictive bites of sweet & savory; the olive oil drizzle was magnificent & (I assume) a high quality one.   He enjoyed the salumi (bresaola & proscuitto) and cheese (parmesan & mozzarella) platter. The sage honey & spicy grain mustard accompaniaments were especially delicious.   Thumbs up for his rack of lamb. I chose farroto (faro) with fava beans, morels, & pecorino, which was extremely salty, & not up to par with the other amazing items we tried.   I'd be hard-pressed to recommend; just another celebrity chef getting paid to throw her name on a Vegas eatery.",

    "text": "I hate to admit that my familiarity with celebrity restaurants on the Strip is few and far between due to budget constraints.  Just like any casino, hotels and restaurants on the Strip have one objective in mind which is quite blatant in Giada.  New York Times' Pete Wells compared the space to a museum since everything from the napkins to the plates to the tons of retail merchadise showcase the brand of Giada de Laurentiis, Italian-born American celebrity chef.  This profit-driven objective may be easily be overlooked by well-heeled diners with its tasteful but casual interiors and satisfying food.  You are greeted with counters of freshly made pasta and antipasto at the entrance.  The space is relaxed, chic and beautiful, with views of the Strip.  $100 will get you satisfied for lunch, but for dinner and drinks, you'll definitely need $200/head or more.  Serving sizes are a little small, but the quality of food is excellent.  I really enjoyed the seared tuna bruschettas, the scallop risotto and the Tomahawk steak was excellent.  There are evil servers wheel around a dessert cart coaxing you to spend some more.  Giada is a well-oiled machine to please, but make sure you read the fine print.

    "text": "Unfortunately, disappointed. We had dinner here last Sunday evening. We had a 10:30 reservation. We arrived early and were told we could sit at the bar if we'd like and our table would be ready. We went to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks as well as 2 appetizers. Drinks arrived and about 10 minutes later the hostess notifies us our table is ready. We told her we had ordered appetizers and asked if we should close our tab at the bar. The bartender comes over and says she has yet to put the appetizer order into the system. Ok, no big deal.    Have to mention that \"Giada\" is everywhere. Not actually Giada herself but her name is on everything. I understand the importance of branding but it was a little much. I also thought it was a little tacky to play her cooking show at the TV above the bar. Giada the brand will get you into the restaurant, like us. I wanted to go there because of her but it won't get you to come back again. The food and service will do that but that didn't happen in our case.   Get seated at our table. The view was by far the best experience of the evening. We were almost above the corner of the street at a window table with an amazing view of the bellagio fountains. Loved our table, perfect. We ordered our appetizers again and added one. The burrata, chicken meatballs and orzo meatballs. Burrata was good, can't really go wrong but the meatballs were nothing special.  We saw other tables had bread, we had to ask. Also had to ask for water and there was no mention of the tasting menu by our server.   I ordered the lemon pasta with shrimp. Pasta was good, shrimp was dry and over cooked. My husband had the lamb. He orders lamb often when we go out and he was disappointed. We choose several desserts off the cart. Favorite was the chocolate cake.   They closed the windows to the restaurant where we were sitting while we were still eating which really changed to mood. We had to wave down a server to get our check and then another to pay it. Walked out and saw the photo booth but went inside only to see an out of order sign.   Overall, the service was lacking quality and the food lacked flavor.  We didn't leave feeling like we had a special meal or good experience. It was just ok.",

We ended up waiting half an hour past our reservation time. However, the hostess and or server apologized several times for the wait.    Knowledgeable servers, decent drinks,  and delicious food.  The portions are small in the tradition of European cuisine, so order some appetizers to share along with your entree.  We had the kale and mushroom pizza antipasti. I had the G signature cocktail, and tenderloin sliders for lunch,  and was not disappointed. Finished off with the cappugiro and assorted cookie platter.  Overall this was a fun dining experience with good food and a great ambience.  I'll have to come back for dinner sometime.",

We sat on the benches in what looks like is part of the bar, hoping we could get an appetizer to pass the time, but they won't serve food there, even though it's a mere 5' from the bar. After we're finally seated, we learn they are out of 1 of the 2 pasta dishes they have on the menu. It's lunch, how does that happen? I ask for the muffuletta sandwich, they are out of that too.  Living in Las Vegas, I've gotten used to most celebrity chef restaurants providing great service and great food. The food was okay but there is no room for the \"take it or leave it attitude towards patrons\", especially on the strip. I'm sure the name will keep it open for awhile, but that won't last forever. Great TV show however.",

The bread platter was delicious but who would expect less from Giadi.  We had the rigatoni and pappardelle.  The rigatoni was served al dente which you would expect from any decent Italian restaurant.  You could taste the quality of the ingredients.  It was a vegetable base and it did not lack the depth or texture of the beef.  The pappardelle was delectable with fresh greens on top to cut the richness of the pork.  The gravy was in just the right proportion to noodles and pork.  The setup showcases the kitchen with the brick oven for the freshly made flatbread pizzas.  The servers were gracious and polite.    All in all, good eats in the words of Alton Brown.",

We had the pecorino with honey, the crostini with ricotta, the rigatoni vegetable bolognese, and the filet. All delicious, I wish I could have tried everything on the menu but we were so full. I guess we'll have come numerous times, haha. The chocolate truffles and cookies from the dessert cart were a perfect ending. We will defiantly return!",

The hosts and wait staff were very personable and the decor was nice. However, I was extremely disappointed with the food. The orzo meatballs were just okay. They weren't hot and lacked flavor. My gnocchi also lacked flavor and I couldn't finish it because it was so bland. I tried my husband's carbonara pizza and it was good, but not spectacular. We decided to order the donuts for dessert, though I was disappointed by this point and didn't expect much. Surprisingly, the donuts were good.  I really, really wanted to like this place! No, actually, I wanted to walk away from there confirming that Giada was the awesome chef I had envisioned, but sadly it did not live up to my expectations. (And it's not cheap).",

Unfortunately our party was too big for a window seat but they managed to give us a table close to the window with a great view regardless. Also make sure you're on time for your reservation because they will give it away if you're late. There's a free photo booth you can snap some cute pictures in while you're waiting for your table to be ready.  This is a very nice restaurant so you have to realize the prices are high ($30+ for a plate of spaghetti) & the portions are small. Don't be fooled though, despite how small my meal looked when it arrived by the end of the night I was full. Our waiter was very friendly, they bring you a drink menu on an ipad & after your order drinks you get your food menu. Constantly refilling our water glasses & making sure we had everything we needed. A bread platter with different types of bread & spreads is brought out while you wait. I ordered the risotto with crab & scallops & I was in heaven. Perfectly cooked, flavorful & rich. I tried to savor every bite & was sad when I got to my last forkful. For dessert I tried their fresh fruit tart which that night was made with glazed apricots. TO DIE FOR. We ordered 3 different desserts & out of all of them the fruit tart is the one I'd recommend to anyone.   Can't wait to come back here whenever i get the chance to vacation in vegas again !",

Service this time had greatly improved; we had an attentive and friendly waiter.   Wine list selection by the glass is just OK; the brunello vintage was that of a poor year but yet overpriced per glass ($24).   Food was OK. We started with one cheese, the mushrooms, and the romaine salad. The cheese was fantastic, paired with the bread. The salad was great (romaine) with a fantastic lemony Caesar dressing. The mushrooms were very cold and had a weird flavor with slabs of cold cheese on top. Next, we had the rigatoni, risotto, side of potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The rigatoni was pretty great and I loved the risotto. But the sides were both cold, and lacked flavor. The Brussels  sprouts were so fried they were completely black and limp.  For dessert, we had the cookie platter and limoncello souffle. The cookies were ok. The lemon were great, and that's about it. The souffle didn't really have any sort of limoncello flavor - it just tasted more like a vanilla souffle.  All in all, I appreciated the refined service from last visit, but I probably wouldn't return. The food is just too inconsistent.",

Perhaps more volume is gained with this presentation, but it took away from the atmosphere for me. The food was great-loved the octopus, Bolognese, charcuterie, wine list was good. The giant red pepper grinder and photo booth were just plain FUN!",

Photo booth is a fun distraction when waiting for your table - and a smart little marketing tool to boot!  Orzo Meatballs were delicious as was the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese. The buttermilk gelato with raspberry sandwiched between lemon cookies made for a simply divine dessert! A highlight of our weekend's culinary escapades! I will say, however that the plate could have used a bit of decoration/garnish - maybe a mint leaf or a raspberry drizzle. Just a little extra effort.   When it came to service and pacing of our meal, they really came up short. The staff were friendly but scattered. The meatballs seemed to fly out of the kitchen / and everything else after just crawled. We were in vacation mode - and it was still jarringly slow! My coffee - that I ordered once I realized the Prosecco Sangria was just sparkling wine poured over under ripened fruit - no infusion, macerating or flavor imparted by the fruit whatsoever - was Never refilled (despite a very slow meal!) it was overpriced but that kind of comes with the territory. And I know they are going for a minimalist vibe but if you are serving egg dishes, I think you should have salt and pepper on the table.   Of course I would go back - because it Is such s well decorated spot - and I love Giada!",

My other diners chose the chicken and waffles.  Unfortunately this where it really fell,short.  The lasagne was flavorless and had zero depth. It tasted like a deli lasagne at the local supermarket reheated. I was very disappointed.  The others who had the chicken and waffles liked the seasoning buy the chicken was extremely dry.  The desert was the souffle.  It was good but not great.   Service was fairly attentive but the speed of our meals was at a snail pace.  It took at least an hour to get our entrees.

The first was for my birthday in which my honey called to inquire if they had a table with a view he could reserve. His wish was their command. The manager, Michael and the entire serving staff were incredibly gracious in accommodating his request and making me feel special! Our view was SPECTACULAR!!   Another SPECTACULAR element?...anything and everything you eat here. Seriously! The food is beyond flavorful; its rich without being too much or overwhelming. Everything is balanced and included with a purpose. My honey and I tried a couple appetizers...the calamari (oh mah gawd) is a must, the meatballs (yes please) are uniquely her (Giada) own. The pasta dishes are delightful! All of their pasta and bread are freshly made in-house.   In my second experience I was able to try their polenta waffles from their brunch menu. Talk about scrumptious. The texture and flavor was way beyond what I was expecting. Home run with this one chef!! I decided to continue my sweet craving by sampling the Lemon Ricotta cookies...these were perhaps one of the most delicious cookies I've ever eaten in my LIFE!!!   There are so many wonderful aspects of this restaurant. I can't speak highly enough of all of the staff, from the beautiful hostesses to the servers and chefs, to their incredibly friendly management. The ambience is chic and classy, not at all pretentious for being located on one of, if not the hottest corners on the Strip! I understand that the prices may seem a bit overwhelming for some, however, its VEGAS...on the Strip!! You get what you pay for and that is a beautiful dinner, awesome dinning experience, and exquisite food!!",

We decided on the tasting menu and have them do the wine pairings.  From the tasting menu, we enjoyed the tortellini and spaghetti.  The filet entree is also decent.  The appetizer is not anything special.  We ordered a plate of cheese and salami which they bring out a slice of Taleggio and some Cacciatore Tartufo.  I liked it but my co-worker did not.  The desserts that came with the tasting is a selection of their desserts.  The wines that they paired with the tasting is a miss.  We ended up ordering a bottle.  The Giada and Hannibal cocktails are tasty.    Our server was good and tried hard to give us good service.  The manager came over to introduce himself.  I'll come back to this restaurant for specific items and drinks/wines.  I'll reassess my rating if I get a chance to come back.

After we were seated, we waited again until at last our very competent waiter arrived. The iPad Menu we were given was dirty and at only 5% power, displaying the \"charge needed\" message.  It was also confusing as we wondered was this the entire menu?  How do we do this?  Do we order directly thru the iPad?   No, this was the more pricey appetizers and drinks menu.  Later we were given \"real\" menus and a wine list.  OK!  Now we know what to do!   Time goes by....at last we order and also order wine.  (We had no show to attend afterward so we weren't in a hurry.  Good thing.) Before our appetizer arrived we finally received the bread tray.  We were wondering..... (Why is there flavored salt included when clearly everything on the tray was already salty except the pesto?  I mean really salty. Oh well.) The single freshly baked rosemary roll was delicious and we split it.  The very salty lavosh (sp?) and grissini were also nice. Our appetizer, salads and entrees were outstanding, except for the Rigolotto which was dull.  THIS is why I returned and brought a new guest!  We shared tastes and then enjoyed our dessert and coffee. Yes, I will probably return but will bear in mind that it's the squeaky wheel that may get the attention here.",

    "text": "I was hoping for a better visit but unfortunately the customer service left me quite disappointed. I made a reservation for 215pm awhile before my visit to Las Vegas as I didn't know how long it would take me to get here from the airport. I figured it better to be early rather than late.   I arrived to the restaurant well ahead of my reservation around 1pm. I checked in with the hostess and asked if it were possible to get seated right away or if I should come back closer to my reservation. She told me to take a seat on the sofa and that she could get me seated within 30 minutes. I saw that the restaurant was pretty empty so I figured I would get seated soon. After about forty minutes the hostess came and told me it would be another minute. A few moments later a different hostess came out and said it would be about another 5-10 minutes. At this point it was basically my reservation time and I wish they had told me up front to just come back later. However they gave me a window table which was nice.   My waitress came pretty fast and gave me a menu, however I informed her that I had a Groupon. I placed my order and the waitress suggested a souffle so I decided to get that as well. The food came out after a bit of a wait but seemed to taste good so I was impressed at first. That is until I started to get halfway through my plate and noticed egg shells in the dish. I informed the waitress who simply laughed and said she would go yell at the chef. There was no apology or sincerity towards the matter!   I wish I had a better experience here as I has high expectations. However their service definitely needs improvement.",

    "text": "Being a fan of Giada for years, my husband and I visited the restaurant during his birthday weekend recently and sat at the bar to enjoy and experience some of the offerings at the restaurant.  Once we were seated, Beau greeted us warmly and asked if we would like to get anything to drink.  We took a few moments to review the drink offerings. We each ordered a drink ( my husband had a Bellisimo and I an Aperol Spritz) and then a few minutes later ordered some appetizers to start off (Bacon wrapped Dates and Margherita Pizza).  We enjoyed both of those appetizers as well as the bread and condiment toppings that were provided.  Towards the end of enjoying our appetizers, my husband and I had realized that other customers around  us (two gentlemen to my right, a single lady to my husband's left and three sets of couples/ or friends along the other bar) were being asked by Beau and his co-workers if there was anything else they wanted while only our water glasses were being refilled on occasion.  We tried to get his attention at times but to no avail finally gave up after about 20 minutes and asked for our check in hopes that he would have asked if we were interested in anything else, which he did not. With the check in hand to sign I asked for the dessert menu to see if he may ask if we wanted to order anything. After mentioning we wanted to see what was available for ordering and mentioning how I would have liked to try the tiramisu, he made no acknowledgement or effort to see if we would reconsider not closing the bill and trying a dessert dish.    At that point we were a little disheartened,  I signed the check and we left.  Unfortunately it felt as though we were not appreciated at the time because we had only ordered drinks and appetizers and not a larger order.   I did manage to get in contact with management to express our disappointment at the end of the dining experience. I must say that Stephanie was very gracious in listening while I described the situation and provided appreciation for the candor.  It was a welcome experience to speak with restaurant management that showed concern and was willing to go above and beyond (which was unnecessary) to help rectify the situation when all I wanted was for my experience to be heard.",

Baby sweet peppers, marinated olives and an addicting Caesar salad. No one believed the rigatoni was vegetable bolognese - so rich and satisfying, they swore it was meat. The spaghetti was spicy and hurt later, but worth it!   The salmon with English pea and salumi calabrese ragu was a hit with everyone. The rest of our table enjoyed the filet and fried chicken. The lemon potatoes and sweet corn with spicy sausage complemented the entrees perfectly.  I started out the meal with a refreshing cocktail (with aperol, strawberry and basil) and a Cab the sommelier suggested that enhanced our meal perfectly.  A+ night.",

This is notable because we dined at Hell's Kitchen another night and waited 40 minutes beyond our reservation time and the hosts were less than hospitable. After looking at the menu, we all decided on the tasting menu. The courses were hit and miss. We started with the antipasti platter and went off the tasting menu to add an order of arancini. The antipasti was excellent. The bread was warm and soft and I don't know how they did it but the butter was miles better than any butter I've ever had. The pesto was also fantastic. The arancini were a disappointment. They were flavorless. For the second course, I had the lemon cream spaghetti. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the spaghetti was delicious. My third course was the petit filet. This was probably my least favorite course. The steak, ordered medium rare, was over cooked and lacked flavor. The salad was supposed to be a panzanella salad. Every panzanella salad I've had in the past was comprised mainly of day old marinated bread cubes. This salad was a pile of seriously overdressed mesclun with a couple of croutons. The family style sides accompanying this course were fine but forgettable. Dessert was small portions of several of the desserts from the menu. Keep in mind this course is family style and there isn't enough of each dessert for everyone to sample. The lemon ricotta cookies were delicious and the only item I remember from dessert. I ordered a cappuccino with the dessert course and it was delicious. All in all, I'm glad I tried the tasting menu but I likely won't be back.",

The food descriptions were inaccurate.  - Our salad said it included \"olive tamponade\" , when it arrived there was maybe a teaspoon of chopped olives on the side.  - The \"lemon\" pasta with prawns has zero flavor of any kind, and the 2 small shrimp on the plate were under cooked and bland.   My salmon was as good as I could have gotten at Denny's no better. It was cooked on such high heat that most of the salmon flavor was missing.   The Gelato described with a word we had to google that turned out to mean chocolate chips, had no chocolate at all and zero taste of any kind - not even vanilla.     The person delivering our meals couldn't answer any of our questions about the food. Why?  Our waiter seemed to recommend things only because he was told to. Like he was told  \"tonight we recommend the lemon pasta\" that he never tried.   To top this off, this below expectations (being polite) meal was $120 without alcohol.  We voiced our thoughts to our waiter twice, and we were very polite, asking if he'd like some honest feedback on the food. After we told him our thoughts he just shrugged it off. No apologies or mention that he would tell the manager, nothing.   This experience felt like another Vegas broken promise. We were prepared for a nice Easter dinner on our weekend away, but received a very underwhelming meal.",

If you want to ball on a budget but get a great meal that will fill you up, I would recommend getting a pizette (much larger than you'd expect) and then a small portion of one of their pastas, both the spaghetti and the cavatelli were delicious. Staff is great also, very friendly.   Would not recommend getting the frittata, pretty basic. Nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "We spent the first two nights of our week long trip to Las Vegas. We had dinner reservations at Giada's for 7:30 and couldn't wait for this meal!! I highly recommend reservations. Even for a Monday the place was packed. We also felt a bit underdressed, but no one treated us any differently which was nice!  We began our meal with a bread board that every table is given. This is NOT the time to skip on bread with the meal. It's two different kinds, one of which has olives in it. Worth every bite.   We followed that with wine and crab arancini. It was delicious and the rice cooked inside was done to perfection. Gary ordered the Cacio de Pepe Bucatini. It tells you on the menu it is enough for two, but he still wanted it for himself. They serve the pasta in a cheese wheel which is totally cool and also delicious. I ordered the rigatoni which comes with a vegetarian sauce. My portion was small, and I say that as a lot of people expect massive dishes when ordering pasta. You don't get that here and it's okay. It was very filling and a appropriate size. The winner of the meals was hands down the Cacio de Pepe though. The noodles were amazing, the sauce you pour over is incredible and you dig into the cheese wheel to have a little piece of cheese with every bite. Absolutely in heaven with it.   We were surprised with a lemon and chocolate peanut butter cookie at the end and what a delight it was! Service is incredible. Definitely a place we will visit again for a special occasion as it is on the pricier side. But absolutely well worth it.",

    "text": "Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Giada, so I was very excited to try her restaurant. I'll go for fresh pasta any day. We knew we were in for a treat when the complimentary bread came out- a large puffy ball of warm rosemary focaccia and Parmesan flatbread with lemon mascarpone butter, pesto, chile flakes, pink peppercorns, and salt. I especially loved the pink peppercorns and the lemon mascarpone butter. I also enjoyed my artichoke appetizer.  Here's where the night took a turn for the worse. I had made the server aware of a food allergy and then ordered a dish that did not include that ingredient (the server double checked). Now, I was really surprised when they brought out a completely different dish because they were nervous that the dish I ordered contained a similar but completely different ingredient that I had explained I was not allergic too. I was shocked they didn't ask me if I wanted to change my order as opposed to bring me a simple pasta dish that wasn't at all the same flavor profile I was going for.  I tried my friend's dish, the Cacio e pepe bucatini which was phenomenal. I'd highly recommend it. They also bring out a larger-than-life peppermill which was hilarious.  If it hadn't been for the weird surprise of bringing me out a completely different dish I didn't ask for without asking or warning me ahead of time, I would have given it 5 stars. I also like that they are taking food allergies seriously, but when we double check the ingredient list and I clarify that everything in the dish is safe for me to eat, don't not believe me? It went from a delightful evening to a disappointment.",

We were welcomed to have a seat in the bar/lounge area as our table was not ready when we arrived but we were quickly helped by a very nice waitress. Once we ordered drinks, our table became ready and we moved over to the main dining room.  Our server was good but not great as he would keep disappearing for extended periods of times and simple requests would take a while to fulfill. That was probably the only negative of the entire meal.   When it came to food, the bread service was great and the assortment of sides that came with it really added onto the bread. For an appetizer we split the mushroom crostini which was good. I had the lobster ravioli as an entree and it was amazing - the raviolis were filled with lump lobster and the sauce was a light lemon-cream sauce with more lobster and some kale. My friend had the scallop and shrimp risotto which she said was amazing even though it was too creamy for my tastes. We ended up taking a cookie platter to go which we  ate later that night after hitting up some of the clubs.   Overall I would definitely recommend this place as it has a nice homey vibe to it even though it is a super fancy restaurant in the middle of the strip! Prices aren't as high as some other celebrity restaurants in Vegas but isn't cheap by any standard so be sure to look at the menu beforehand",

    "text": "Excellent service. Average food for the price.   We've  been a fan of Giada's cooking shows for years.  Maybe after watching her on tv for so many years, our expectations were too high.  Take away the Vegas glitter of the beautiful restaurant, we thought the food was good but not deserving be high end Italian cuisine The ingredients were fresh but we found the dishes lacking in flavor.   We started our meal with the:   Crab Arancini - $19 -  Rice balls stuffed with crab, parmigiano - reggiano , fried then served with a pomodoro sauce.  Fun Italian street food style dish that's been elevated. The interior had a wonderful blend of rice, cheese and crab. We thought the exterior was a bit mooshy which took away the anticipated crunchy texture in a classic arancini.   Charred Octopus Salad - $19 - Charred Octopus served on a warm potato salad with a cucumber - lemon vinaigrette. This was definitely a winner. The Octopus with a wonderful charred smoky flavor was so tender, it melted in our mouths.  The light cucumber vinaigrette with a touch of acidity complemented the Octopus well. The warm potato salad was perfectly cooked to a tender interior.   Main Course:  Branzino with mussels in a romesco sauce $40 - The fish itself was fresh and perfectly cooked to a flaky moist interior but it could've used more seasoning. The mussels were outright uneatable. They were overcooked, dry and rubbery.  The romesco sauce was indistinctive.  It did not have the rich nutty flavor of a romesco sauce.   Salmon with spiced fregola sarda $39 - The salmon was fresh and perfectly cooked to a reddish pink interior. The fregola sarda had a nice nutty flavor.  But once again, we found the dish under seasoned and lacked any distinctiveness one would expect for the price.   The service staff was excellent. The team regularly checked in on us without being intrusive.   A photo booth in the front by the hostess stand is a fun touch.   We will come back and try the pasta dishes.",

    "text": "Came to Vegas for a business conference. I'm not a huge gambler but was excited to try any of the amazing restaurants. Giada's wouldn't be my first choice but I was invited by a client so I didn't want to pass it up. It's not every day you get to eat in a celebrity chef restaurant.   The atmosphere is nice. We were seated in the back in a private party type room that had one other table. It was nice but I would have preferred the main dining with the view.   The service was so-so. They were semi attentive but mainly to one side of the table only. A couple ordered cocktails, another few a bottle of wine to share. It took forever for me to get a glass of wine of my own though and never had the opportunity to order a second.   The appetizers were delicious. I believe we ordered a tasting menu that included marinated olives, mushroom toasts drizzled in honey, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese stuffed roasted peppers, and caponata. I'm not a date fan but these were amazing! I honesty couldn't find a single complaint on the appetizers if I wanted to. The focaccia bread they bring out is to die for (don't bother with the blah olive one) and is especially good with the caponata on top of it.   For dinner I ordered the spaghetti with lemon and basil and shrimp. I chose to add the scallops. The scallops were delicious. The shrimp was good. The spaghetti tasted of nothing but lemon. No basil flavor, no seasoning, just lemon and cream. Very disappointing. I wish they would have at least offered fresh cracked pepper from the mills I saw around.   The table also ordered some sides of Brussels Sprouts and roasted potatoes. I did not try the potatoes but the Brussels Sprouts were good. I also tried a bite of the salmon someone else ordered. I was almost tempted to get this and glad I didn't. It had a very off putting bite to it.   Overall, Giada's is ok but the food is about as welcoming as her fake smile, looks pretty, but isn't as good as you would expect. If I were to come back, it would be for brunch (the photos look pretty good) or just happy hour.",

    "text": "Food: artichoke hearts appetizer, arugula salad, spaghetti with prawns, scallops, hazelnut dessert. Everything was just ok. The bread plate that they give you was really my favorite part of the meal. It had two kinds of bread (olive bread and then a round loaf of rosemary focaccia) that came with little dipping items (pesto olive oil, sea salt, crushed red pepper, lemon butter and capers).   Service: our server was professional and efficient but a little weird in the personality department. She reminded me of Joan Cusak. I also felt the menu was presented in a passive aggressive way, like saying that the pasta was small so you might want to shore it up by purchasing additional proteins or the whole would you like bottled water or tap water routine. I'm a local so Las Vegas' finest regular water is just fine. She must have referred to it as \"tap\" about 3 times. Plus the pasta size was just fine given everything else we ate.   Ambiance: I requested a window seat in my OpenTable reservation and also mentioned it at check in so luckily we were able to get a window seat. The wall of windows is very nice with the natural light and strip views of the Bellagio fountains. The decor was very soothing in tones of brown and red.   Nit pick: their silverware, particularly the knifes were really annoying me! It wouldn't lie flat on the plate.   Location: upstairs in The Cromwell.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to Giada's since the grand opening when we couldn't get in. This visit to Vegas, we were able to get reservations during the very busy CES week. The restaurant is located in The Cromwell on the strip.  There's a bar area upon walking in with display cases full of fish, pasta and antipasti ingredients. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the wait staff is on top of everything. Our server Paul and his assistant Nathan did a great job of taking care of us.  The best part of my dining experience, believe it or not, was the bread service with accoutrements. The focaccia was like a light and fluffy popover and the olive bread was delicious. Little dishes of crushed red pepper, salt, fried capers and pesto cane along with the bread. It was amazing!  My husband and I shared the ricotta honey crostini and the grilled octopus antipasti. I make better ricotta crostini so I was unimpressed. There were four very small pieces of crostini served. The grilled octopus, however, was grilled perfectly. Two large tentacles were on the plate along with a finely diced potato salad. Very good! My husband ordered the fried chicken cacciatore, which was disappointing. Two pieces of fried chicken with a cup full of the tomato sauce on the side. The chicken was pretty greasy on the outside, but had a good fry and was tender and moist on the inside. I had the salmon which was cooked to a medium and moist and flaky, but I've had that fish at 100 other restaurants. Nothing notable with the dish.  We shared the brussels sprouts with pancetta side dish, which was plentiful and crispy. The sprouts were cooked perfectly with a nice char, but was very salty. Overall, I'm glad I finally dined at Giada's to say I went, but I don't think I would go there again for a full dinner. I would go back for an antipasti and drinks at the bar, though.",

    "text": "After watching Giada on Food Network since I was a child and absolutely adoring her, I was so excited and eager to have the chance to finally eat at her restaurant. The location and ambiance of the restaurant are great! The music is good, our view was amazing, the decor is beautiful. But the food... I can't say I would recommend anything we ate tonight to anyone in good faith.  First off, it's worth mentioning that if anyone in your dining party has an allergy or sensitivity to dairy, STEER CLEAR. Almost the entire menu contains dairy products and there are very few dishes that can be altered without removing an integral part of the recipe. My family is familiar with this process because we are all allergic to dairy and have been our entire lives- we understand this is difficult sometimes for restaurants to accommodate. But to be limited to one or two choices on every single section of the menu is just sad for a restaurant of this caliber.  Once we were able to choose between the few options that we had, the food was thoroughly underwhelming.  The best thing we ate was easily the focaccia bread that came out before our meal, and the 5 of us shared the two small rolls we were given. Thankfully our appetizers came out quickly. However, the Fritto Misto was too salty and the sauce had a very unsettling metallic taste. The charred octopus salad was decent, but the octopus was cold which made it a little bit chewy. And we could taste a significant amount of cheese in the chicken Marsala meatballs which the waiter did not mention to us when we ordered them, even though he knew we had dairy allergies.   The entrees were even more disappointing with the exception of the scallops. They were perfectly cooked, though they too were extremely salty. The spaghetti we ordered was too al dente to the point that it was almost a bit crunchy, and was so bland. It had no detectable flavor at all.  I've read a lot of other yelp reviews which listed complaints about service which we did not experience, thankfully. Hence, the two stars. Our server was attentive and friendly and was one of the only redeeming qualities of our meal at Giada's.   If you're looking for an excellent Italian meal which leaves you full and satisfied, I am sad to say that you should look elsewhere. Giada's was truly disappointing.",

I thought I was the cynic but everyone hated it as much as I did or more. I felt so bad because it was my idea to go since they had Frose on their yelp pictures... guess what? Frose is only seasonal and April is apparently not hot enough for them to add it to the menu. Hmm, April in Vegas is already low 90's so not sure how much hotter is adequate for them to bring it on.   The food was rather lackluster and left me hungry that I went back to our resort and ended up eating an entire bag of hot cheetos over the crappy leftovers from their pasta sampler.   Sooo... nope nope nope & nope.",

    "text": "Just checked in at Giada @ the Cromwell and we had reservations at 11:30 AM for a family Brunch. We checked in with the hostess (extremely professional) and got a beautiful table by the Bellagio Fountains precisely on time exactly sharp at 11:30 AM. Our server name is Billy and he is absolutely amazing!!! He is extremely professional, honest, nice, trustworthy and cares about all his guests. When we checked in on Yelp, there is an offer for a comp glass for a drink but we told him we don't drink alcohol and he was so nice to substitute for coffee at no charge. Wow, that's so nice of him! Extra kudos to Billy! He wants everyone to have an amazing experience and have a great conversation. We love him so much and always ask for him when we dine here. The atmosphere of this restaurant is extremely relaxing and beautiful views of the strip and bellagio fountains. The food is amazing and portions are generous. This is truly a 5 star restaurant. We ordered the brunch tasting menu and has a great selection everyone can enjoy. Everything is excellent and the food is very tasty! Thank you so much, we are locals and will be coming back over and over again. Truly A+ and 5 star VIP service. Kudos to Billy and the whole team! This is one of the best restaurants on the LV strip!",

We enjoyed the spread of sea salt, chili flakes, capers, lemon butter, and my favorite the basil pesto! The orzo meatballs melt in your mouth, the sauce was perfect on them. We ordered lobster ravioli and seared scallops, and let me tell you... I have never had a better cooked scallop in my life. Cleaned my plate! We were too full for dessert but they all looked amazing. Everything was plated beautifully and our waiter was so detailed and so great at his job taking care of us during our meal. The whole house staff makes a well oiled machine that made for a positively memorable first night in Vegas.",

    "text": "I am finally getting around to writing this review! My sister and I went for a girls trip Nov 2018 and had dinner at Giada. We had brunch the year before and had such a great time, we decided we needed to try dinner.  Giada is a very special place in Vegas. Everything from the atmosphere, the decor, the staff, the views, makes this restaurant a standout. Our server was Lauren T, she was hilarious! She has the best personality for working in the service industry. She was super helpful with giving us tips on the menu and side dishes that might go well with what we ordered, but didn't make us feel like we were being pushed. She was super attentive and described every dish brought out to us. You can truly tell the love and time put into Giada.  All of our food was INSANE. Our favorite dish we ordered was the Pecorino Romano wheel with Bucatini. Hands down the best pasta I have ever had. It's definitely a fun dish to share, if you're in Vegas it's a must!!  After our meal, I believe it was the manager, John came to our table. He thanked us for choosing Giada and showed appreciation for our time spent. He asked us about our trip, our last visit to Giada, and our plans for the rest of our visit. He was so kind!! He truly made us feel special. You would think people with a big party would get special attention from management because of a high bill.. but it was just my sister and I! It really meant a lot to us. Coming from LA, it's rare to come across such hospitality, so to us it meant more than just a thank you. Vegas has some of the best customer service in the country, and Giada is the perfect example of it. I recommend to everyone and am excited to go back soon!",

    "text": "Straight up we did not actually have dinner here, so if you are looking for a review of the food, you'll have to look elsewhere. We would like to relate our pre-dining experience.   We made our reservation through Open Table a few days prior to going to Vegas for a work trip. We specifically asked for a window seat, as it is typically quieter than the middle of the restaurant and there is of course an obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains.   We decided to stop in the afternoon of our reservation to reiterate our request with the front of house staff, and to also have a look around at the space. We asked what we had to do, short of bribery, to assure a window seat 5 1/2 hours later?  We were taken aback when one of the two young ladies said that there was a way to assure our window seat! All we had to do was provide a credit card imprint, and commit to spending at least $200 USD on a dinner for two, with no tip or tax included!  Having dined the previous night at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace (reviewed later) and spending $200 USD with a generous tip, all in spending that much again did not seem out of reach.   However, to be committed to a number, and to have to provide a credit card imprint smacked of gouging, and greed to us, so we declined to GUARANTEE our requested table, and chose to take our chances.   We arrived a few minutes early for our 8:30 reservation and were told our table was not ready and offered a seat at the bar. As we walked into the bar I watched a table at the window getting up and gathering their belongings, which lead me to believe that we may have lucked out and got our requested window seat without being hijacked to a number determined by the restaurant.   I went to the washroom to wash my hands while the lovely K went to the bar to wait for our table to be available. When I returned to the bar she was looking at an iPad. I asked what that was and she said the bartender had dropped that in front of her without speaking a single word. I asked \"you mean he didn't welcome you to the restaurant and ask how you were doing this evening?\" Her reply was \"he didn't say a word to me.\"  I of course was quite surprised, but not really given our earlier experience, at the lack of customer service. I pushed past the obvious poor customer interaction and had a look at the wine list on the iPad.   Now I know this place is trying to be high end, but it does show $$$ on the rating. The food itself is not crazy expensive, but the wine list prices were enough, along with everything else, to cause us to question why we were there......  Now we love Giada, her recipes we use often, and we were very much looking forward to our culinary experience with her food as well as Bobby Flay's.   As we left the restaurant prior to being seated at our table we remarked to each other \"does Giada know about the SEAT TAX that they have in place?\"  There are so many culinary choices on the strip with Chef's that have much more accomplished resumes than Ms. De Laurentiis. We found another great place to enjoy dinner without the minimum hanging over our head.",

Service was poor - Andrew was slow, too busy and gave a horrible recommendation on the dish I ordered. I asked for a cheesy baked pasta with red sauce and got the Bucatini, which had NO cheese and tasted liked canned tomato sauce poured over spaghetti noodles  2.  It was so very noisy and we sat in a small, tight space.  Although the Super Tuscan wine we chose was excellent, it was costly!   3.  The value is terrible - my husband had the scallops which he enjoyed, but he received 4 scallops at the cost of $40 for the dish.  We will not return and cannot recommend this place.",

Truly a professional.  Beautiful restaurant - do your best to get a seat by the windows. Watched the sun set as we drank a beautiful bottle of The Prisoner wine.  If the Truffle Burrata with Campari tomatoes and micro basil has been written in invisible ink, I still would have found it...zeroed in on that right away - outstanding, savored every bite.  Halibut - perfect for a blazing hot Vegas day - with braised Swiss chard, grapes, almonds and fresh herb sauce.  We had a 6:30 dinner reservation and there wasn't an empty seat when we left - wonderful testament to a fantastic restaurant.  They do offer a tempting bread service with numerous spreads and oils. Trying to do the \"low carb\" thing, we declined although I think I had tears in my eyes. Outstanding wine list and that alone is enough to get me to return. Cena straordinaria!!",

Don't remember the name but it's basically calamari and fried shrimp.  This was really bland but you could add some flavor with the condiments that came with the bread.  3 stars. Chicken Marsella meatballs:  These were pretty good. 4 stars. Risotto:Excellent.  Would give 5 stars. Scallops:  3 stars here.  They were cooked right texture wise, but once again no flavor and kinda dry. Fettuccine: 3.5 stars.  A little above average. Lemon potatoes: Hard, dry, slightly burnt and not mashed.  Sent back but still charged for them. Spicy corn and sausage.  Good flavor but didn't see any sausage.  2 stars. All in all, if you are going to drop over 200 bucks you would expect something better. I still tipped over 20 percent because the waitstaff was great.  Expect to spend up to 2 hours here as the main courses come out slow. This also in more of a hustle and bustle than an intimate setting.  Really loud.",

What a huge disappointment I have to say.  I sent my meal (prawns) back twice!!  They were cold.  And to top it off it was a milestone anniversary, which they were advised but never acknowledged at all!  Huge disappointment!  When we left the greeter at the door asked if we enjoyed our anniversary dinner....I said they never acknowledged it...he was surprised and offered us some cookies from the dessert cart, which was kind of him.  The photo booth was not working when we entered either.  I have told our story to so many foodies as I was so disappointed.  I did write a review at the time, but never heard any feedback from the restaurant.  So still not sure if we will return or not with so many fine dining places we do go back every year.  Just had to vent a little.....sorry Giada!",

We had to wait in the bar for almost 30 minutes before we got service and then at the table we waited almost an hour between our appetizer and entre.  My risotto was very good but hubby's halibut was dry - but the sauce was good.  Our dessert course was so late, and we were tired of sitting there, we took it togo and ate it at home.  The hostess and our server kept apologizing but we have taken it off our list.  As locals, there are just too many other Italian places to eat that will treat you better for half the price.  Typical of a chef owned restaurant - they give it their name and forget about it.  Reading the other reviews I see this is typical of Giada's to serve food late and having grouchy, hungry patrons.  Good thing I had a Travelzoo coupon to soften the price for such poor experience.",

We were seated promptly on arrival at a window-side table overlooking the strip and the beautiful Bellagio fountains.    I ordered the Chopped Tricolore salad-  prosciutto San Daniele, tuscan kale, endive, radicchio, dates, walnuts, Gorgonzola dolce.  So freaking delicious.   Our server suggested it stating that it was her favorite and I can see why.    Our appetizer was the Orzo meatballs w/ parmesan pomodoro sauce.  Good, but not amazing.  It came with three medium sized meatballs.  When I stabbed my fork to grab one of them, it kind of fell apart.    Lastly, we had the Gorgonzola, wild mushroom and kale pizza.   Lots of kale, but lots of flavor.  Some might say the cheese can be overwhelming, however I'm a fan of Gorgonzola.  The pizza seemed to be drizzled with some kind of sweet vinaigrette or sauce but I forgot to ask what it was.  It was very good though.  Our server was very pleasant and very helpful.  She kept our waters filled and was very knowledgable about the food that was being served.   She even offered to take a family photo of us before we even asked her to do so!    4 stars for the food and another 1 star for great service.  Also, on your way out, be sure to try the photo booth where you can take photo booth pictures that you can email to yourself.",

    "text": "Dinner reservations are hard to come by. I booked online 3 weeks out and could only get dinner for 2 at 5:15PM.  It was totally worth it.  The pasta in the lobster ravioli was perfect - thin, not rubbery. There was no shortage of lobster, and sauce was light, fresh, and didn't overwhelm. It was very well put together. Cocktails were tasty. Service was attentive but not over the top. The view is great and it was nice to have some of the windows open.  About the only thing not very well thought out was the photo booth off of the lobby. 2 people can't fit into the seat and you can't reach the screen to operate it. It's a nice idea, but it doesn't quite work. Once you get into the restaurant, everything else clicks. It's worth booking early and eating here.",

    "text": "My mom and I had dinner here recently and really enjoyed it.  I did make a reservation several weeks in advance but easily got the time I wanted.  We were sat in a back corner near the windows but it was actually nice back there.  More quiet than the main dining space.  The view of the strip is awesome.  You can see the Bellagio fountains right next store.  We started with drinks.  I just had a basic Ginger Ale but my mom had a Bombay Sapphire and tonic.  I think they make their own ice or get it from some place special as the ice was perfectly square cubes.  Really cool.  My mom's drink was strong so that was good too.  For our appetizers, I had the Tricolore salad and my mom had the minestrone soup.  My salad was delicious.  Lots of great flavors on it from different lettuces and toppings.  Nice vinaigrette on top.  My mom really enjoyed her soup.  It had a parmesan crisp on top that was her favorite part.   For our entrees, I had the scallop and crab risotto and my mom had the lemon shrimp spaghetti.  We both enjoyed our entrees.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  The crab was mixed into the risotto.  My mom thought the shrimp were a bit over-cooked but she liked their flavor.  I would say though that for the prices you pay here, we should have gotten more scallops and shrimp in our entrees.    Prices are very expensive but Giada is a celebrity chef so you expect it.  I would say portions are a little small for the cost but the food is tasty.  I definitely will be back.  Our waiter and assistants were very attentive and came around often.",

    "text": "Wonderful place for a lunch with lady friends! (Ok... great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner with anyone period.)  Service was a bit slow... or rather ... it was leisurely (I should say to make it more positive sounding)... so definitely good place to go with friends and gab. OR... if you have business to deal with... good place to go to have a lovely meal and have time to discuss business.  We tried the White and Red Sangria.  The Red Sangria seemed a bit on the sweet side whereas the White was refreshing and I honestly could drink it all day.  Their Wine Menu is impressive.... lots of sparkling wines and still wines.   Don't be intimidated... ask for a recommendation.   I highly recommend a sparkling as a starter with your antipasti as well as with their zucchini scapecce (shoestring fried zucchini... so good!)  My mom and I shared the Chopped Tricolore Salad. Kale, dates, prosciutto, radicchio and all sorts of yumminess.  The Gorgonzola dressing was a bit heavy so if I were to order this again, I would ask that they go super light on it or serve it on the side. It's a great salad.  The freshness of this salad hit the spot.  I'm not a kale person... this salad could change that.  I particularly love the prosciutto and date combo. Oh Yum!  I had the Muffuletta sandwich and Mom had the Venetian sandwich.  Both were good.  But the Venetian was way more decadent than the Muffuletta.  I  thought the bread on the Muffuletta was a little tough.. so I ended up eating the insides of the sandwich which were very good!  My girlfriends ordered the Faro Salad and the Tenderloin sliders.  I got a taste of the Faro Salad.  I'm totally ordering that one next time.  The faro was tender ... not like other Faro salads I've had where it's more \"grain\" like.  And the light, citrusy dressing was perfectly light but loaded with flavor that enhanced the salad rather than distract from it.  I did not taste the sliders but they looked damn good.  :)  My mom finished with the Mocha Mio.  I highly, highly recommend this.  It's hot dessert in a cup.  I took a sip and it was heavenly.  Espresso, Chocolatey Goodness with a hint of Orange Citrus flavor.  I didn't think it sounded good on the menu, but oh how wrong I was.  Right now (through the end of March, I think)... Locals get a 20% discount for breakfast and lunch.  So... if you've been meaning to try Giada's... and you're a Local... Go Now!  :)",

    "text": "Had lunch at Giada on a Friday.  We had a reservation, but the place was nearly empty, so that wasn't needed.  It's large and it's appointed nicely.  I wouldn't think I would have liked the setting, but I did.  It has a large view of the strip, as it's right on the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Boulevard.  There is a lot of seating on the outer edge of the room, so if you want a view of the Strip, you should ask.  They can open the large windows, but I found that when you open the windows you pretty much just get traffic noise.  So, the views are interesting, but I didn't love having the window open.  Our server approached us very quickly to take drink orders.  My buddies ordered specialty cocktails, including a bloody mary with a ball of mozzarella and a slice of sausage.  I didn't sample them, but everyone liked their drinks.  To start, we decided to go with the gorgonzola with pear honey, the orzo meatballs, and the goat cheese stuffed sweet peppers.  My favorite was definitely the gorgonzola with honey.  The honey was thick and difficult to spread, but it was fantastic.  The sweetness of the honey and the saltiness of the cheese was excellent.  The meatballs were a little disappointing.  We'd heard such good things, so we were surprised.  The orzo challenged the integrity of the meatballs, they kind of fell apart.  They weren't bad, but certainly worse than we were expecting.  The peppers were fairly straightforward.  No heat at all, I could have used more goat cheese.  To eat, I had the Venetian panino.  It comes with turkey, gruyere, fontina, mustard, and peppedew peppers.  This is one of the best pressed sandwiches I've had in a long time.  The bread is lighter than typical panini bread, and it was crisp, but didn't cut the roof of your mouth.  Often paninis have bread that is too thick or too crusty, but Giada's was near perfect.  The ingredients went well together.  The turkey was a tad on the dry side, but the mustard helped that.  The cheeses were fantastic, really tasty and melty.  This sandwich just worked.  My buddy ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with added prosciutto.  I had a bite, and it was nice and caramelized and very cheesy, but too lemony for me.  The citrus was overpowering.  For dessert, we had the chef's trio of cookies.  I can't remember the other two  cookies, but the winner for me was a large warm chocolate chip cookie.  Slightly crisp, gooey, and packed with chocolate.  A little sea salt on top would have put this over the top, but it was a very good cookie.  I would come back, I'd like to try dinner at Giada.  But, we were very pleased with our lunch and I absolutely would re-order that Venetian panino.",

Our party of five was seated at a semi-circular table overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains - a truly spectacular view at night.  The menu - many appetizer choices, but honestly nothing on the menu was a standout. Meatballs were tasty but small portions. Burrata was salty, offered as a tiny sample. Gorgonzola and honey - maybe three bites worth. Fritto calamari - overly browned and about 5-6 pieces. The risotto with charred scallops were delightful, but as a main course I could have eaten 2 or 3 more servings. My other dinner guests seemed to enjoy their veal, lamb, fish and pasta dishes, but I didn't hear anyone raving about their meals.  Overall - a very mediocre meal that was overpriced and skimpy. I went home un-fulfilled and hungry for breakfast the next day. Nice date place to impress, but not to satisfy your hunger. Also, was disappointed Giada was not here and we couldn't see her. I'm not in a hurry to come back.",

The restaurant is very homey and welcoming.  The smoke of the wood burning oven adds to the ambiance.  If going, I would recommend going for dinner as the lunch menu was limited.  I wanted to eat pasta, this is Giada's place isn't it, but no pasta on the lunch menu.  The lunch menu consisted mostly of small app, salads, pizza's and sandwiches.  We had prosciutto, olives, meatballs for starters.  All were very good and tasty.  Our party had 2 lobster roll, grilled cheese lemon pesto sandwich and lasagna.  The lobster roll was excellent.  I had a bite of the lemon pesto sandwich and it was good to.  My friend loved the lasagna, although it was quite small of $24.  This place is not cheap, for what seems to be a casual lunch. Apps and entrees (no desserts) came out to $200 for 4 of us.  I definitely want to check this place out for dinner.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed in my experience at Giadas!  I mean, it's Giadas, so I was expecting a lot!  It being on the Las Vegas Strip and a bit more pricey, I was expecting TOP NOTCH service!  Didn't really get the best customer service.  Our waiter seemed like we were a nuisance to be served right from the start!  I mean, we didn't even look at the food menu, he asked what we wanted to drink and I said tap water and from then on, the experience went downhill.  I was a bit insulted....I don't go to a restaurant like Giadas to drink....I go to EAT the food she makes!    Well after we looked at the menu, asked our questions we had on how certain dishes were prepared, I began to order.  I ordered two appetizers and a main entree for myself and my friend ordered an appetizer and main entree.  When we were done, I saw that the expression on our waiter was more attentive, seeing that we were spending our money on food instead of the alcohol.  But really?  One should not base their service on how much a customer is willing to spend, but that's how I felt we were being treated.   Another thing was the waiter that served us was terrible in explaining how dishes were prepared.  I ordered the Lobster arancino after asking how it was prepared.  The waiter did not state it was \"deep fried\" and instead said \"pan-fried\" now there's a difference between the two....well let's just say, the fried rice balls were MUCH better at Macaroni Grill.    I was however, thoroughly impressed with the Lemon Spaghetti, Giada's signature dish.  Now if it wasn't for that this, I would be giving it 0-1 stars....but because of the lemon spaghetti, I may actually decide to go there again JUST for that one dish.   Forget about dessert, it just sits out on a car in the restaurant UNCOVERED, becoming dried up in the LOW HUMIDITY of Las Vegas....terrible idea!  What they should do is have a cart for decor purposes only, and use only that, have the customer's order and prepare it fresh in the back kitchen.  I mean cmon, for the price you're paying, customers should at least get some freshly made desserts to end their meal!    Well that's my rant...and I RARELY give negative reviews....just did not have a good experience here.",

    "text": "Giada has been one of my favorites from Food Network. Everything she makes seems so good. I'm so glad she has a \"home\" in Vegas. We tried to make dinner reservations for my birthday but their soonest availability was a month later. Don't expect to be seated if you're wearing very casual clothes/ have no reservations. We witnessed a bunch of people getting turned away.  The bread service was pretty good. The interior is very beautiful, modern, sophisticated but still comfy. We were given a tour of the restaurant. Our server was fantastic and the manager checked on us.  The menu items all seemed delicious. They have a dolce cart: chocolate, cherry, sorbeti, gelati, cookies, berries, eclairs, tart, etc.  Orzo Meatballs: Very tender and juicy beef balls with orzo in pomodoro topped with grated Parmesan. I didn't want to share and I'll definitely get this again when I return. 5/5  Chicken Cacciatore: For 2 people. They'll show you your pan-roasted chicken with veggies before they bring it back to the kitchen to fry the chicken. The chicken is crisp but not oily, bursting with flavor, tender and juicy. I've had cacciatore from other places and Giada has the best I've had so far. 5/5  Lemon Potatoes: Smashed and fried potatoes with lemon and grated Parmesan cheese. This was a good side dish for the chicken cacciatore. 4/5  Spaghetti: Lemon, basil, shrimp and capers. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy but not heavy. However, my large pieces of shrimp were a bit overcooked. Otherwise, this would have been perfect. Flavor profile was superb. 3.5/5  Chocolate Tiramisu: Topped with candied hazelnuts and gold leaf. Creamy, light, airy and mildly sweet. 4/5  Blueberry Eclairs: The eclair itself was wonderfully flaky and blueberry filling just oozes out. The top has glaze and fresh blueberries . 4/5  Chocolate Amaretti: A chocolate cake covered in dark chocolate topped with good leaf. You can definitely taste the amaretto. 4.5/5  Overall, I was very satisfied with what we had and the service. I'll come back and try a few more dishes...or even get the spaghetti and maybe ask if they could not cook the shrimps too much.   They're currently open for lunch and dinner. They'll be open for breakfast October 2014 and weekend brunch beginning of next year. Something to look forward to.",

    "text": "This was a real disappointment from beginning to end. First off, and if the restaurant is listening, please take note..... We don't need our hostesses to be young and beautiful. We need them to be polite, insightful and welcoming, qualities that these (albeit young and beautiful) women did it possess. It's almost as if they were trained to be distant and aloof to -- I dunno-- give off an air of exclusivity that the restaurant clearly doesn't possess. We had an 8pm reservation. Lots of empty tables. Told to wait. Why? \"They're clearing your table\". Now, baring an earpiece or telekinesis, this (albeit young and beautiful) hostess had no way off knowing if they were clearing our table or not. Five minutes go by. \"They're checking on your table.\" Again, she's checked with, nor communicated with, no one since the last time. Just seemingly threw that one out there to keep the dialogue open. Five more minutes. \"They're clearing your table.\" Okay, so we've looped back. Now I'm getting upset, if for no other reason than my four year old could clear and set a table in less time than the young and beautiful hostess with the earpiece and/or telekinesis claimed a trained busboy could. With that she decides to give in and offers up an expectedly robotic, \"Right this way.\" I was hoping from here on out the experience would be somewhat enjoyable, if not slightly special, but nope. Service was disorganized and poor (despite a little more enthusiasm from our waitress), and food was so unmemorable that I could barely even tell you what I ate. In general, there was just this feeling that nobody was running this ship.... not a maitre d, not a manager, and certainly not Giada who's name was thrown around quite often, but who I suspect has long been there in nothing but name only. Giada -- if your listening -- your name is on this place, your image is present wherever we look -- stop by once in a while and see if this so-called gourmet restaurant is still worthy of your brand. There are so many great restaurants in Vegas. This one definitely deserves a pass.",

    "text": "This was my second time here. I came for breakfast after flying in from San Diego.  I asked for a window seat even though I was alone and she acted as if I had committed a crime.  I waited patiently after she seated two groups that arrived after me till she would seat me.   My server was very friendly and he really made my experience better.  The food was good and I really enjoyed the frittata. The decor was beautiful.    As I was leaving, I wanted to check with my lunch reservation later on in the month and asked the hostess if I could request a certain area.  I received the same treatment as when I first got there that I was asking for too much.  I really wish they would train their hostess better, I know it's Vegas but can you try to act like I'm welcomed.",

    "text": "We were coming to Vegas for just three nights, and this was number one on my list for where I wanted to dine, so I didn't take any chances and made reservations almost three months in advance (June 20th for a September 12 experience).  To say I had high expectations is putting it mildly, so honestly I didn't think there was any way it could live up to them.  I'm happy to report they managed to EXCEED them. (and that was sans Giada herself)  We  arrived about five minutes early for our 5:30 reservations and were greeted warmly by the gals at the top of the stairs, given the brief tour and led to a two-top overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  sigh, it pays to plan ahead, folks.  :) The table was just the right size.  Small enough that we could easily converse and share food, but just large enough to handle all the food we ordered!  Service was at a comfortable, relaxed pace. The whole time we felt like guests who were welcome to stay all night if we wanted.  They aren't about turning tables, which might be why they stay booked up.     I had to try her Signature Cocktail!  I still don't know what was in it, other than egg whites and a cool G.  Very delicious, with enough body to it that the G stayed in place for a long time.  Meanwhile Husband had the most incredible iced tea ever.  Made right in front of us, he was given his own little pitcher with some agave syrup.  I ended up ordering one later after coveting his.  ($6 each and worth it).  As we perused the menu, I was trying to get Husband to give me an idea of what he wanted, but honestly I was very okay with him letting me decide, as having read reviews and the menu online (happy to report also that they have the updated menu with updated prices on the website now, by the way), I pretty much knew what I wanted to try!  We started with the Orzo Meatballs and the Lobster Arancini, along with their fabulous bread service.  Loved the spices to kick up anything we wanted to! Now I can make some good balls, but I gotta say, these were excellent...both the meat ones and the rice ones!    Next we shared the Romaine Salad, which they brought to us split.  It was light and refreshing. Then we did the Spaghetti with Shrimp, Lemon, Basil and Capers.  Pasta & Shrimp perfection...yum!  And so was the Crab Risotto with the BEST Scallop I have ever tasted in my life.  Period.  Don't know why, as it appeared to be simply seared, but it was so rich and light at the same time.      Full, we still couldn't resist a sample off the dessert cart (after all, they were so small).  Husband wanted to try a nipple truffle...they gave him three.  I wanted to try the blueberry eclair...oh it comes with a cream puff too.  Plus, somehow two lemon ricotta cookies and a chocolate chip one landed on our table as well (thanks!).  I don't know if it was an oversight, or we had already spent enough or what, but we were not charged for any of the desserts. Again, made to feel like welcome guests.    Meanwhile, we got to watch the Bellagio fountains, both in the daylight and after the sun went down, very cool!  I might also add that while this experience was more than we normally pay for a meal for two...for a total experience for two, it was just under $200 and well worth it!   The view outside plus the full experience inside, it was a truly magical evening that I will never forget!  (which is why I chose this to be my 600th review).  Thank you Giada for taking your years of culinary and world experience and creating this place! And extra thanks to your hard-working so-polished staff....True culinary gems, in the kitchen and in the front!  That being said, where was the infamous photo booth everyone talks about?   We never saw it!",

They were running out of so many dishes but we didn't think anything of it. When they brought out our food, it was like there were legitimately 6 or 7 pieces of rigatoni in my friend's bowl and maybe 2 or 3 more in mine. 2 people in my party ordered the shrimp spaghetti and one got less than the other.  Very unacceptable for any restaurant, especially one on the strip and at this price point.   The server made it awkward by telling me it's \"always like this\". No, it isn't. This was probably my FIFTH time dining at Giada and I've never had such bad service and little food. Needless to say, none of us will be returning.",

No doubt a luxurious room, the posh banquets and enormous windows with a view of Bellagio some of the perks offered from a place whose prices speak to celebrity Chefdom and Strip-side surcharges more than perhaps any in town, rest assured that one will not forget they are dining at Giada during a single moment of their meal, the name of its proprietor found on everything from menus and napkins to the artwork...small cursive Gs outlining many service pieces, as well.  Humorously handed a card suggesting #hashtags and @handles to tweet with during the stay it was from the full brunch menu as well as a prix fixe tasting that invitees were left to decide from, the service exceedingly pleasant if not a little overbearing - though the special coffee menu did have to be requested while refills of the houseblend drip were infrequent to come around.  Inexplicably targeting every writer in town at once, a PR move I'll never comprehend as a steady stream of positivity would seem far more beneficial than an obvious en masse lovefest, it was nonetheless in in three courses that our 130-minute stay would take place, some dishes far better than anticipated while a few were no better than those found Off-Strip for less than half the cost.  Beginning with a pastry basket offered as part of the prix-fixe, for our purposes self-selected but usually Chef's choice, only the Monkey Bread was particularly memorable as both cornmeal-based options were far too dry, and moving on to appetizers suffice it to say that aside from stingy portions none of the Antipasti \"platter\" showed as well as it sounded, the better bites found in a la carte options including the moist chicken meatballs awash in spices and a duo of cheeses that were well aged and portioned to fit the double-digit pricetag, the accoutrements and crisp lavash also faring well.  Acknowledging the import status of their Artisan meats, but hardly ever to pass up Mortadella whenever it is found, it was an intermezzo \"pizza\" that would be far better described as a flatbread which seperated appetizers from entrees and with a pleasantly pliable crust and a good sapor to the meat the quality was just fine aside from the $15 tab, particularly compared to dreadful gnocchi that may as well have come from a box, the bowl going unfinished despite being no more than four spoonfuls of limp noodles laid in a watery and insipid sauce.  Turning next to entrees, a porcelain crock featuring layers of eggplant and noodles separated by spicy sausage undoubtedly a highlight of the meal, those interested in tasting Giada's signature cacciatore without going all-in at dinner have their chance to sample alongside crispy polenta waffles - recommendations to combine sauce, bird, and syrup not worth the time or effort as separating the plate as two-halves is far more successful, though neither is likely to make anyone say \"wow.\"  Finishing up with dessert, the options scaled down from dinner and lacking in seemingly obvious bombolini for reasons unknown, the go-to dish is undoubtedly a pudding-soft citrus souffle served with buttermilk gelato while the leaning tower is no more than a Cold Stone quality ice cream cake, an \"inverted cappuccino\" entitled Cappugiro from the specialty coffee menu a far more intriguing proposition and the sort of thing for which I could almost justify a return visit, if only to sit at the bar sipping while enjoying the view.  **Told by some that Giada has improved since opening while others suggest they have locked in their core clientele and no longer need to try, I'm sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle, an experience worth having once if only to say \"been there, done that\" but not the sort of place warranting return visits for those who truly care about value or great food.",

I expected delicious food, and impeccable service and unfortunately received neither. The margherita pizzette was subpar. It tasted like an average personal size pizza you can order from any bar. The bacon wrapped dates were served room temperature and didn't taste very fresh as if they had been sitting out for awhile. Orzo meatballs were ok. Salmon was blah, the best part about it was honestly the small pieces of broccoli served on the plate. Lemon spaghetti with jumbo shrimp was bland, sticky and dry. Wagyu short rib was average. The best part of the meal was the bread that was served complimentary with all the accoutrements. The service was not what I usually experience at a $$$-$$$$ restaurant. We sat for 30 minutes between appetizers and main courses with nothing on the table. Our waiter forgot to put in our main course orders after insisting earlier that we order all appetizers and mains together. Sorry but I will not return and I don't recommend it.",

When I mentioned bland to Waiter, he said \"the pasta probably soaked up all the sauce!\" Huh?? He brought me some sauce in a cup that was like nonfat milk. Also, why no parmasean? That would of given the pasta some taste. All in all very disappointing meal. I have her cook books and make her lemon spaghetti all the time and it never tasted like what's served!!",

    "text": "What a dramatic event our dinner was. My bf and I booked this restaurant because at a glance, the reviews on Opentable are amazing - 6k+ people and still 4+ stars. We were excited for a treat. We show up in time for our reservation, casually dressed. If this matters, we're a young Asian couple who dress 'poor' (sneakers, jeans, hoodies). The host ladies were very friendly and quickly lead us to our table. From there it was downhill. My bf went up to quickly to use the restroom. During this time, our waiter (Asian) stopped by with menus. He didn't even say a word, just briskly asked \"do you want the drink menu\". I was a little taken aback by how snarky he was. I answered yes, and also requested an additional food menu for my bf's seat. This dude plopped down a wine menu and an ipad, and then returned with a menu and handed it to me without a word. Phew. I was still thinking, maybe this is fine... Until another couple was seated 2 tables down. I was a little curious about a fancy envelope that was also given to us. That's when I hear our server detailing how to use the ipad menu (for drinks) to the other couple, as well as explaining what the envelope included (a tasting menu). I whisper to my bf that the server was treating us differently, but we were both still interested in staying for dinner. The waiter finally returned to get our drink orders, in the fashion of standing at our table and staring at us while acting like we were wasting his time. What? From cheap diners to 3 star restaurants, never have I been treated with such blatant disrespect. I guess it showed on my face, since the waiter asked tartly: \"Is something bothering you?\" That's when we decided to walk out. I told the hostess how unacceptable the server was. The manager was brought out, and convinced us to stay. The new waiter was amazing and the manager treated us to dessert, but we couldn't get over how horribly we were treated initially. Unless you wear your money, these waiters can be pretty judgemental.",

    "text": "My wife and I have adored Giada for years from afar and eagerly anticipated eating at her restaurant on the strip.  This was one of the worst meals we have ever had. It started with the bread then the appetizer course of bacon wrapped dates was just nasty.  Thank god I didn't order the $83 bone in steak as the guy at the next table ordered and proceeded to eat about three bites of it.  I ordered the signature spaghetti with prawns and while it looked beautiful, the shrimp was rubbery and tasted like it was old. My wife had the rigatoni and the pasta had been way over cooked, to the point of just being a mushy mess.  We passed on dessert as the couple next to us ordered the tasting (at $125 per person) and tried a bunch of the desserts and said they weren't good.  (We saved our sweet teeth for Carlo's).  Service was mediocre at best.  Save your money.  There are way too many Great Italian restaurants in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Excellent Service, and almost perfect food. A big fan of Giada as well since I watch food network A LOT.   Arrived at Vegas and this was our first stop due to our reservations. A remodel hotel that has Giada right at the 2nd floor. If you wait outside the restaurant, there is a photo booth for you to take pictures. Yes I said it, They so ballin' that they have a photo booth to use(too bad i hate taking pictures or else I'll be all over that haha).   ANYWAY, when you first walk in, you can see all their different kind of homemade pastas and it's kinda an open kitchen sort of way. Greeted by our server that thoroughly explain the items on the menus and cocktails. You have an electronic(ipad) menu. We decided to order the tasting menu(I forgot the name), two appetizers, two pastas, and two entrees. The manager came up to us and check on us which was awesome. We were also given complimentary drinks which was an extra +. It was a sweet wine drink that was given to us topped with lemon. Sooooo good. Not sure why they gave us the drinks(maybe cause they're barely open)  I love the hot bread that they give you. Although, I can't eat too much of that because it's such a heavy filling bread.   Grilled Broccoli Rabe w/ calabrian chili vinaigrette - nothing too special but I do like the chili oil sauce on it. Plus, it's good to have some kind of veggies.   Finocchiona - the salami. It was enriched with flavors. Topped with grapes and apple. Goes wonderfully together.   The sampler came with Chicken Marsala Meatballs w/ roasted wild mushrooms, Citrus Marinated Calamari salad w/ sundried tomatoes & olives, Lobster Arancini w/ calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli, and shrimps. We ordered the medium size one.   I don't know if it's me personally but I was really disgusted by the Chicken Marsala meatballs. I thought it had a really strange flavor to it and this is probably the thing I don't ever want again at Giada + the Lobster fritter thing. The lobster thing was so so. I felt like it tasted better than it looked. I liked everything else after that. They had this shrimp that was marinated in a salad sauce that was really good. They give you JUMBO shrimps because the shrimps were fucking huge. It was really tasty. The cucumber frittes/fries were addictive and so was the calamari.  Personally, the two things that I loved the most was the two pastas. Ravioli (rah-VEEOH-lee) lobster, asparagus tips & tarragon  and the *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil. The Ravioli was Godly good. The skin was perfect and the inside was filled with lobster. I recommend eating it as a whole bite because if you tried to eat it piece by piece, the sauce comes out from the ravioli making it less flavorful and tasty. The *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil was really amazing. It seems so simple but the spaghetti was soo good. It tasted fresh and they had fresh shrimp that compliments it well. The lemon and basil wasn't too strong which made me love the dish. I recommend people to get their pastas...it was heavenly.   The two entrees were lovely as well. The waiter described the salmon as one of the best salmon you can get and I think he was right. It was so juicy and it was cooked perfectly. It seemed like it was still a little raw but i think it was meant to be like that because it just add another layer to the dish. I could do without the succotash.   The veal was really good as well. It was fried perfectly. if you cut it, the juices flows out. Look at pictures and it is topped with cheese on top. A really heavy dish.  Oh and the other thing I didn't like about GIADA was the side dish Sweet corn & spicy sausage . I think it was a personal thing but I thought the corn wasn't cooked all the way. the sausage tasted fine and all but the corn had a nasty texture to it.   BEsides that, I recommend GIADA to all people. I can't wait to come back again the next time and trying more of their pastas and hoping to meet Giada herself. Excellent experience with amazing food and service! Cheers",

We made a reservation ahead of time (two months in advance) and were disappointed when we were seated at a small table where the sun shone directly into my husbands face. Because the waitstaff could not lower any sort of blinds, we asked to be moved. We ended up in the bar area (which was fine). Our waiter convinced us to order multiple plates of food (smaller portions meant for sharing). We decided on three plates. We were very surprised when our food arrived and it was enough to feed four people. I can understand wanting to sell dinner, however, it was such a waste of food.",

    "text": "Giada, you have a problem.  This dining experience was a near disaster with the number of errors, communication errors and short comings of the staff and restaurant.  Our party was seated and drinks were ordered (a Birdie, iced tea, coffee and water) to start. First the Birdie arrived, followed by the iced tea, and finally the coffee as water was provided when we were seated. The iced tea was a light amber color and tasted more watered down than a bootleggers bottle of whiskey during prohibition. When I asked the server about it, she stated that it was white tea and was more mild. This however is FALSE, it is in fact black tea. FAIL. They brought me a raspberry tea in it's place which was fine.  The coffee arrived, and it was cold - really this is inexcusable unless specifically ordered to be iced or cool. Additionally a cup of green tea was ordered and a cup of black tea was delivered to the table. This warranted a visit to the manager who did what she could to rectify some of the issues.  My wife and I ordered the brunch sampling menu which featured a plate of pastries, appetizers, choice of entree, and dessert. One of the appetizers featured salmon which neither my wife or I wanted so we asked for a substitution (which they would happily do). When the appetizers arrived a single plate of pastries arrived and appetizers with salmon. The salmon was sent back and a plate was returned without the salmon. I asked if the pastries we received was a single serving or for two, and the server wasn't sure. She finally let me know that the plate featured one additional pastry for both of us.  I selected the chicken & waffles (roasted chicken with cacciatore sauce and parmesan crusted waffles). The chicken didn't have much flavor by itself, the cacciatore sauce was watery and featured more peppers than anything else, and the waffles were brittle and dry. Take this one back to the kitchen Giada... it's not ready.  The Tower of Chocolate (three layer chocolate cake) and the Lemon Ricotta ice cream cookies with raspberry sorbet. The ice cream sandwiches were superior to the tower of chocolate, but really neither one made a lasting impression on me.  For the price point of the restaurant and experience avoid this restaurant. Giada you have quality control issues and considering your name is practically on everything in the restaurant, I expect more. My first visit was a pleasant experience, but this one shows the deterioration of the quality and service level.",

Service less to b desired. Going down hill. Servers were way more attentive the first few months of opening for us. Our waiter took our order & we didn't see him again till he brought the bill. Never mentioned any specials or checked to see how things were. Hope he splits his tips with the people that actually waited on us. Plus we felt rushed the whole time. We hadn't even decided on an entree and he kept wanting us to order it with apps. Glad we didn't because both appetizers came out at the same time as the complimentary bread seconds after our drinks. Wasn't relaxing. If I'm going to spend $$$$ on dinner I don't want to be rushed. Giada has been there on the previous visits & things seem to run more smoothly when she's there. Can't count on that all the time.  Side note. We asked for a table by the window when we made reservations. They wanted $100 a person to guarantee a table. Although most will probably spend that while there, I'm certainly not paying in advance just to look out a window.",

    "text": "I rarely write a negative review, as I know the restaurant business is not easy, and everyone thinks they can do it better.  We visited Giada for the first (and probably only) time Saturday April 23.    Here is the good - Giada is a TV celeb, so some people like that.  The decor is very nice, and the restaurant is bright with large windows on the corner of the Strip and a side street.  The staff, male and female are all younger and attractive.    Here is the so-so - the menu is not terribly inventive, a Mediterranean survey of pasta, risotto, and other fairly typical italian/mediterranean dishes.  Nothing really jumps out as a \"must order\" item.  It is very pricey, and the wine list is high (sure, as are most of the nicer Strip restaurants).  The two appetizers we had (chicken meatballs... 4 small ones, and 5 bacon wrapped dates) were ok, but not worth the approximate 30 dollars we paid for them.  Here is the awful - We made an early reservation and announced to our server we had to make a 7:30 show.  We were assured that nothing we ordered would be a problem for our time frame.  After over an hour, and several assurances that it was \"on its way\", we gave up.  We announced to the manager on the floor that we had to leave, and offered to pay for what we did receive - two appetizers and a bottle of wine.  At that moment, our entrees arrived and the staff offered us... to go cartons!  They accepted our offer to pay for the wine and the two appetizers, and we left, furious.    To the manager's credit, she did invite us to return after the show to try dinner again.  Even though the concert was outstanding, we were in no mood to so quickly go back there.  Don't be dazzled by a TV personality name... there are many other nice places to try on the Strip.  I look for an interesting menu, food well prepared and presented, and good service.  Didn't find it at Giada.",

    "text": "I'm not in love with Giada's.. but my review truly reflects a 2.5 as the food was very good..   There were so many things that just took me out of enjoying the experience fully. We arrived at 715 on a Wednesday night so it wasn't terribly busy but it wasn't empty by any means. We are locals and ae familiar with convention schedules and whatnot, so we chose to go on a quieter night.   My date and I had a nice array of items. We started with the 'Spicy Italian Sausage Arancini' served with parmesan fonduta & pomodoro sauce. As well, we enjoyed the 'Fregolotto' (fre-go-LO-toh) with roasted rainbow cauliflower, garlic puree, parmigiano, kale pesto, crispy prosciutto. We shared them both as appetizers and they were both great. Rich, delicious flavors and good portions, everything very shareable. The pasta was split for us in the kitchen as well, which was greatky appreciated. Bread offering was also good but i saved room for dinner so I didn't really have much of it.. though it was delicious.   For the mains we shared the 'Surf & Turf' 7oz filet with two large prawns, port wine sauce, creamy gorgonzola gnocchi & baby carrots, and the 'Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib' served with soft polenta, & garden vegetables.   I ordered my filet medium rare and it was perfectly cooked, and one of the better steaks I have had recently. The Creamy Gorgonzola Gnocchi were also delicious. Again, nicely portioned and really perfect texture on the cooking of the filet. Just so good. The Short Rib wasn't my favorite. Although I do really like short rib and I do really like polenta. The flavor profile fell short for me personally,. The wine component was great in my mind, but maybe it just didn't translate well to my palate after having things like the rich gnocchi or the port wine sauce ont he steak. The polenta also came across a little unseasoned.. but again maybe it was me. My date didn't care for it, so it was pretty much uneaten.   We had a couple of cocktails and some California red blend wine.. and everything was good. No question when the food was being cleared as to why we didn't eat the short rib, but we wern't looking for any other food so it wasn't a huge deal. I would have appreciated it if they had asked though.   Now, a couple of thigs that I want to mention are in the interest of constructive criticism.   Mainly, our server was so blatently intent on upselling us on everything.. which is part of his job I realize, but it was a bit rushed and short of quality service. Not staying with us at the table in terms of presence, constatnly looking elsewhere while we were asking questions and looking for suggestions, (based on how we wanted to manuever the menu nicely without over-doing it but still getting a few items to try.)   Every request for guidence was met with short, curt responses. Pointing at the menu seemingly going for the priciest options was the answer to everything. The money wasn't the problem, we knew what we were geting into.. but, I would have liked a bit more personalized service based on our cocktails and wine.. and just not so hurried. It may be asking too much. I was fully aware of the other tables and how he was being sat so I wasn't intending to take up time, but it felt rushed and I just didn't care for that.   Another thing - the backwaiter or server assistant, was really a big distraction.. and I honestly don't mean to be rude.. but when you are trying to have a nice quality meal -  the sound of silver being loudly set onto tables, and clanging together while being polished and then tossed into a drawer or sideboard of some sort - is not cool. Also,frequently we were asked if we would like water botlle refills, and forgotten.. and then asked again and forgotten. Not the biggest deal but it made me feel like it was a turn and burn situation. I didn't like that at all.   On top of that, the 'back of the house' conversations and opinions of other guests from the backwaiter and the servers - were just inappropriate. Finger pointing and crude remarks that were clearly meant to be offensive. The guests being spoken about may not hear you, but we heard every word. It's something I may not have even noticed, were I able to stay int the moment and just enjoy myself.. but that silver clanging had me hearing and noticing everything else that was going on.   So overall, food 5 stars.. but service was like 2.5 stars. I'd go again, maybe sit at the bar.. I do like quality food and they have it.   Well.. Happy Eating To You!",

    "text": "Not very good for breakfast or dinner. Had the lobster mash, lemon chicken pesto sandwich, and sunrise waffle. The eggs were both over and undercooked in every dish.  The lobster mash was very plain. I could make it at home. It's simply chopped Vegegables, pieces of lobster and chunks of potato. Probably cost me 12 bucks. Don't pay $34 for it. It's very uneventful and not exciting.   The pesto sandwich was decent. Nothing special, pretty strong lemon flavor.   The waffle was decent. The flavor of the syrup was the best part. The waffle itself was soft, but light. Not necessarily crispy... The way I would've liked it to be.",

    "text": "I went back to Giada last night to give it another try.  Thanks to Laurent, who is the General Manager, he was able to accommodate a last minute reservation, as I was in town for work, and previously had a bad experience.  I can say that this time was much better.  The food is amazing.  We had a party of 9 and went fairly big.  The table ordered quite a few appetizer platters (all delicious), 4 pasta dishes which were just outrageously delicious, main courses for everyone, and dessert.  Each course was fantastic.  Giada has done some amazing work here.  The pastas were my favorite, and in hindsight, I wish that I ordered that as my main course (maybe 2 pasta dishes?).  For my main course I had the lamb, which was also really good.  It had a mint flavor, and was cooked perfectly.  Most others at the table ordered the Branzino, and they did seem to enjoy it as well.  Dessert was amazing.  Many choices on the dessert cart, and we tried quite a few.  My favorite is probably the White Chocolate Gelato.  I have not had that flavor before and I was blown away.  My only complaint about the evening was that service was pretty terrible.  We had to complain multiple times about the slow service, forgetting of orders, and incorrect dishes.  I think that it is mostly due to us having a bad waiter.  Giada herself came out to say hello and help rectify the situation.  Giada did not apologize for the service, and chalked it up to being open for 6 weeks.  I found it understandable.  Giada took a couple pictures with us, and was there quite late. They helped rectify the bad service by providing free dessert (and even telling us before we ordered it).  I found the fact that they accepted the criticism well, and responded appropriately very good.  Giada is def. worth trying if you come to Vegas.  Plus, Giada is even more pretty in person!  I hope that they serve pasta at the bar in the near future so that I may return on my own and have a quicker meal.  Everyone deserves a second chance, and I'm glad that I gave Giada one!",

    "text": "Wow! What a fantastic meal. From start to finish the attention to detail was incredible. The staff was well trained for the soft opening, the kitchen executed beautifully and Giada was in the house to see everything was up to par. It did not disappoint!  Cocktails are well thought out and the Hannibal was a crowd favorite. We sipped on those while we gazed over the huge selection of anti-pasta items. It's a bit overwhelming to choose, because they all sound delicious, but eventually we decided the table would share the dates ($14), burrata ($12), orzo meatballs ($13), rollatini ($12) lobster arancini ($18), salami and cheese platter. Bite after bite was utterly delicious. However, the dates stood out as a favorite, like most these were sweet and salty, but what set them apart was the spice from the Italian sausage. They had some serious kick, which I loved. The aged parmesan from the platter was dreamy, as well.  Next, we shared a variety of pastas: Giada's signature spaghetti ($28), tortellini ($26), ravioli ($34), and farrotto ($26). The spaghetti's simplicity really shines with a touch of lemon, basil and three jumbo shrimp. The ravioli was delicate and filled with wonderful flavors from the lobster, asparagus, and tarragon. The farrotto had a wonderfully chewy texture and earthy flavor from the morel mushrooms and distinct richness from the pecorino, we really enjoyed it. The manager brought over an order of risotto ($30) for comparison. It too was delicious, it oozed with bold seafood flavors from the crab and scallops. You cannot go wrong.  We had already enjoyed a feast, but the main course was still to come. We had the veal chop saltimbocca ($43), rack of lamb ($45), and Tuscan ribeye ($68). The veal chop and the ribeye were straight from the Flintstones. These were extremely large portions even for the heartiest of appetites. Every bit of it was stellar. The lemon potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. They are smashed and fried and topped with cheese.  Meat and potatoes never tasted so good.  Dessert selections were chosen for us. There was a trio of gelatos, the espresso and chocolate really stood out. The banana was the least favorite. Then, there were assorted cookies, tart and other pastries. To cap it off they served a scrumptious nutella espresso that was simply sinful.  The dining room is gorgeous. You can spot Giada's special touches all over. The retractable windows are impressive though it got a bit warm when they were open. The photobooth is fun and sets the mood for the playful evening that lies ahead.",

    "text": "OMG, if there was ever a reason to give a restaurant a perfect 10, then Giada gets it!  THIS IS MY VEGETARIAN DREAM!  Through all of my travels around the world and back, Giada of the most fantastic restaurants I've ever experienced, hands down.  From ambiance to food to service, no detail has gone unnoticed.   I'll start by saying that this restaurant is a ray of light in the dark underground-esque-walk-through-a-casino restaurant scenes in Vegas.  As soon as you enter the space, you're greeted by the aroma of delicious food, an antipasti bar, a wood burning oven, cooks in the kitchen and food & friendliness all the way round.  It's like walking into Giada's personal kitchen!  Then, after checking in with the host, you'll walk into the dining room to find a GORGEOUS, sexy, ambient-lit space with a killer view of the Bellagio and that part of the strip (mind you, you're several floors up and the restaurant faces the Strip).  You'll get an interactive cocktail and drink menu, from which I would HIGHLY recommend starting with one of Giada's signature cocktails.  I already forgot what I had, but it's a refreshing summery whisky something.    OK, now I'm getting onto the food, which is still calling my name days later!  The first and foremost delicious thing:  they start with a freshly baked crucible (?) of focaccia bread, fully loaded on the side with any topping you would need.  For your courses, You gotta go for a little of everything.  It's all meant to be shared.  So I'll ramble off some of what I had...the compilation vegetable plate, flatbreads, a side of potatoes, two types of vegetarian pastas and DESSERTS.  Cookies are a must, especially the lemon Ricotta, one of my fondest memories.  Then try the polenta cake.  It has a delectable strawberry topping with a dollop of cream.  MMMM HMMM.  ****FINALLY:  Can I just give a shout-out to my server Nathan and our Sommellier (I forgot her name).  They were just so stellar and they're the kind of people you'd want to invite to your house to have dinner, chat, and treat really well b/c of how nice they treated you.  REALLY FIRST CLASS!!! *******  I gotta go back to Vegas in a month for round 2 so more to come then...",

    "text": "This review is personally for Giada.  Upon arriving to Giada, I was met by at least 8 hostesses standing there all wearing the same maternal looking black dress and ill fitting heels.   Then we were met by eclectic decor and wrinkled table clothes.   Shortly after we were seated we were greeted by our waiter and another girl saying she would also be helping. The waiter told us that all the appetizers and drinks were on the iPad. Using an iPad cheapened the experience for me and the authenticity of the restaurant. Just because restaurants are starting to implement iPads does not mean it works in a fine dining setting. And to make things worse the iPad froze multiple times. I also thought it was a little tacky when the waitress put the price fix menu on our table. It's okay to suggest it but to have a whole folder that takes up half the table is too in your face especially on ones first visit. We decided against the price fix until we knew the food was worth the price.   15 minutes after sitting down there was still no bread brought to our table so I requested some from our waiter. He comes back with three different bread choices and a side of toppings. I was surprised that the one topping I did not see was Parmesan. The bread was very underwhelming but I did enjoy dipping the breadsticks into the pesto.   I ordered the caponata and the spaghetti with shrimp lemon and basil. My dining partner ordered the bucatini for her main.   Before the caponata came our waiter said caponata is usually served with bread but Giada's is light enough to be eaten on its own. While the caponata was not heavy it was still a little much eating it on its own. The spaghetti I ordered was solid even though it could have used a little more seasoning. The shrimp was some of the largest I have scene however it was sitting in what seemed to be a small puddle of blood and this turned me off. I tried my friends bucatini and ending up like hers more and she liked mine more so we traded. The bucatini pasta was well cooked but the sauce was undeveloped.   We ordered the cookies to go for dessert and they were great. My favorite was the palmier.",

    "text": "I love watching Giada on the Food Network, and was really excited to try her restaurant in the Cromwell Hotel & Casino during a weekend trip to Las Vegas.  I came with a girlfriend on a Friday around noon for a light lunch to celebrate her birthday. The restaurant is gorgeously decorated with a homestyle-chic feel to it. It is spacious and well lit with natural lighting. We were promptly seated in a U-shaped booth with a window view, which we requested. We both had the penne carbonara pasta dish and the birdie drink. The pasta was amazing. I loved how the pancetta had a perfect flavor and crunch to it, and balanced perfectly with the al dente penne pasta and light creamy sauce. I also really enjoyed the birdie, which was refreshing, sweet, and not too tart. It was garnished with a strawberry that was fresh and sweet.  The presentation was clean and beautiful. We each had a placemat set at the table with her signature napkin, fork and knife. Each dish was served on sleek white plates. The drink even had a little signature cocktail napkin, which was a nice touch.  The service was okay. They seemed a little short-staffed, which is understandable since they had just opened for the day, and the restaurant was less than a quarter full of guests at that time. It was a little difficult to flag down a waiter to order drinks.  We had fun in the complementary photobooth on the way out. You can select to print out a photo strip or email the photo to yourself, which is super fun and makes the experience special and memorable.  Overall, we really enjoyed dining at Giada. The food, drinks, and atmosphere were great. I can't wait until my next trip to Vegas to dine here again.",

    "text": "We had our first experienced Giada's a few months ago and absolutely had one of the greatest experience from a restaurant on the Vegas strip. We had the lobster Brussel sprouts ravioli and the amazing blackberry Moscow mules. It was so delightful!  So we decided to reserve a table for my spouses  birthday and deployment to Iraq. He was super excited to come back and enjoy the ravioli and blackberry mules he indulged on during our first experience. I reserved a table for four and window seating over a month in advance.  Now speed forward to our dinning experience. We showed up 25 minutes early so we could enjoy a cocktail and a blackberry mule only to find out that the blackberry mule was no longer on the menu. Which we totally understand but he was so looking forward to it! It's to die for! Then we were seated at a table that was no where near the windows! So that's strike two! Then to put the icing on the top of the cake, you no longer have the Brussel sprout lobster ravioli. I could see my spouse was not pleased and a little disappointed. Now with all of that said I know you change your menu and seasonal drinks; that's to be expected. But not having a window seat, when I reserved one over a month in advance is troublesome. So this was not anywhere close to our first experience. Also there shouldn't be a commit section when you make a reservation if it's not going to be acknowledged.",

A real Welcome To My Home, Let Me show You Around & Feed You My Best Dishes experience.  Among all the antipasti platter choices my favorite is Giada's. Although I think I might ask to sub the pesto crostini for something else. Among the pasta selections the Lobster Ravioli is still my favorite but now I'll also add the Bucatini to that list.  For dessert the Polenta Cake, Strawberry Tart & Chocolate Chip cookie were worth the calories.  Tomorrow I will give the new lunch service a try.......

We we were greater and seated smoothly in a prime location- the window seating has a beautiful views and the top half open to present a beauty autumn evening al fresco.  The bread service had a lot of care in a beautiful product with sea salt, basil pesto, red pepper, lemon aioli and capers on the side; yes we got a second plate.  Appetizers- I would not have ordered the meatballs but the were the star. Succulent and a very interesting sauce. Frito misto was a little different- the lemon and fennel were served as a relish it was good but not memorable I should have gotten the regular aranchini instead of the one with crab. The crab just did not work although they are well cooked  Entree. This is where the wheels fell off. A half order of bucatini was embarrassing. The pasta was over cooked until it actually reminded us of a can of chef boyordee.  Also it was overpowered with red pepper.   The short ribs were very good but note that it is a small serving.   The lemon cream shrimp pasta was well prepared but very little flavor. The saltimboca was well cooked but the best part was the side sauce.  A minor hiccup was the coupon for a free plate of cookies I got for checking in.  Server said sure but then billed us for them.   Overall it was a pleasant evening in a beautiful place but I would not return for the food, especially at the prices",

We arrived right on time for our reservations, but were not seated until 20 minutes later.  As a warning, if you are looking for an intimate date spot, this is not the place. It was loud, and the view of the strip is nothing to get excited about. Try Mon Amu Gabi instead.  Now about the food, the meatballs and the shrimp cocktail were good, but our spaghetti, including the shrimp, was so over cooked that the pasta was gluey and chewy. The scallops was over-doused in capers, and again, scallops were overcooked. Amateur mistakes that should not happen in a restaurant at this price point.  No notice of the less than 1/2 eaten spaghetti by our waiter either, and when we brought the overcooked items to his attention, he was just as dismissive as he had been the entire evening.  We skipped dessert because after the food quality of the pasta and the main, the calories for subpar dessert didn't seem worth it.",

Also, Don't forget to order dessert; coffee and hazelnut gelato was so delicious! It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny; I can't wait to go back!

My husband has the top tier players card with Caesar's properties; which customarily grants you priority seating at most restaurants. The girls at the front rolled their eyes about this, produced painfully fake smiles, gave us the run around and made us wait waaay longer than another couple with no reservation and no tier card.   After being seated we waited 20 min to get menus and when the waiter also had a shitty attitude; we walked out. Guess who was also walking out at the same time?? The couple who had been seated just ahead of us had eaten their entire meal in the time we'd only received a menu!!   We are big believers in the tipping economy here and take great care of wait staff. We went over to Mon Ami Gabi, where we were seated immediately, had a delicious meal and our incredible waiter Jeremy took great care of us.   Don't care how good Giada's food is; that's no way to welcome some well traveled foodies into your space. We'll spend our winnings elsewhere!!",

They have a fun photo booth you can use before during and after your meal and we had such a hoot. It's all digital! We got the table by the window in the corner and I would say the ambience is really fun because they've got modern music playing at a moderate level and it's just so big and airy inside but also warm. Our server was beyond incredible he was very busy but always funny and attentive when needed. He made our birthday celebration very special and also didn't make us feel so bad that the table adjacent to us asked to be moved. We were just having fun and taking selfies but as my sister said. They just wanted a different experience. Haha. Ok to the food -  bone in rib-eye, arugula salad, lobster ravioli, lemon pasta, octopus, mushroom bruschetta. Omg. Everything tasted delicious!  Our drinks were perfection, I got the cosmo Blanco and the amaretto coffee after. Yummmm! So Giada, simple and delicious.",

We don't normally order dessert after a meal, but we wanted to try a few of them. We each ordered something different so we could share. My son ordered an dessert espresso beverage. Our other 2 desserts arrived and we were told his was on the way. We ate about half of the desserts, and flagged down our server to ask about his espresso.  We were told it was on the way. We finished the other desserts. Still no espresso.  45 MINUTES went by, and still no espresso.  We asked to see manager, who said she would comp a few things and would recerse original amount chargedto by account, as by this time I had already paid the bill because we just wanted to leave. I've checked my bank account and no reversal has been processed.  I've called and spoken to 2 different managers at the restaurant, and still no changes to original charges. It's been well over a week now. So, time to call my bank and argue the charges. Very very disappointing experience, as it was our first (and last) time dining at Giada's.",

Made a reservation for 14 people on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner, I must say that this is hands down the worst service I have ever received at a \"fine dining\" restaurant. My server was completely unhelpful, disengaged and seemed bothered that he had to serve us. The food was mediocre, appetizers- bacon wrapped dates and the charcuterie and cheese were great. The main entrees that we got- the signature spaghetti and scallops were bland and lacked flavor, the wine that we had was good and well priced. The server didn't offer any recommendations, and while the ambiance is great paying a higher price for poor service and mid level food overall felt like a waste of money and would recommend trying somewhere else.",

And, as I expected, he didn't mention her birthday.  He delivered our drinks and food okay, but, at a restaurant like this, the service should be outstanding.  The place was extremely loud, which they seem to supplement with garbled background music.  It was a nice place to try out but I doubt if we'll go back.

Well then we wait longer still no water etc... We finally meet our waiter he says he will be right back, still no water even though we asked for it. He comes back eventually and we order drinks, he forgets two of them but blames others. Problem continued throughout. Too bad because food was great but service is terrible! We told him it was a birthday celebration and no acknowledgment at all of the bday! We will not be returning! So sad! Not worth it at all unless you want to be ignored!",

We were advised that we could request that it NOT be very spicy, which we did.  It came to the table and was very spicy and when we inquired about it,  the waiter said \"it depends on the cook\".  We each took 2 bites and were unable to eat it. We then shared a $57 Veal Chop Saltimbocca that was marginal at best. Needless to say we were very disappointed and would not recommend it to our friends.",

Offered them a $20 for improvement that will satisfy the wife.  5 min wait to move things around.  Given a 6 person booth, across the isle, between 2 windows.  Can see the Bellagio fountains from 3 seats.   Sun set is pretty amazing tonight.  Its not too loud.  Dress is all over the place, wearing kakis and Tommy Bahama silk shirt.  Ordered a round of drinks, shrimp and calamari and 2 orders of Arancini to share.  Checking out the wine list and finding Tomasi Amarone is the winner.  Drinks are slow, appetizers arrive before the drinks and are taken away.  Major kissing up for the slow drinks.  All fufu drinks except for my scotch. wtf?   I go for the veal chop that looks like bone in wiener schnitzel, daughters share the bucatini in a cheese wheel, its huge.  Wife the shrimp spaghetti w mascarpone, lemon, basil. son and GF had the lobster ravioli (too much butter) and fettuccini w chicken.   See pics.  Will be back next time, one of the favs.  $644 for 6 including cocktails/wine, after the tip.",

There's a million places in Vegas to grab a great meal, this just isn't one of them.   We consider ourselves foodies, eat fine dining all the time in Denver, Seattle, Vegas, and New Orleans. Started out good with an interesting bread plate with fried capers and some yummy pesto dipping oil. Ordered 2 apps, mushroom crostini (which was excellent) and also the calamari. Bit Into the calamari and it was seriously the fishiest calamari I've ever had. Informed the waiter and he said we were the second folks that evening to send it back.  They Sub'd our calamari with a fried tomato/cheese dish but they must be sharing the same oil, because it tasted like rank fish as well.  Kind of ruined the rest of the experience for us. Pork chop was OK. Short rib Parpadelle was only borderline, not as much flavor as expected.   We left disappointed.",

    "text": "Is Giada worth the hype? Yeah...personally I think so. The ambiance of the restaurant puts confidence in me to know this will be a good experience. Also, the food was fresh and well-presented. Service was attentive throughout the night.  Wish I knew about the photo booth by the hostess desk. I would love to have quality photos of our night instead of taking a selfie by Giada's marquee at the bottom of the escalators...lol. So don't forget to check out the photo booth! Our candlelight table was by the window with a great side angled view of the Bellagio fountains and LV Blvd.   Along with their complimentary assortments of bread and its corresponding condiments, Boyfriend and I decide to order a few appetizers to share. We got:  Bacon Wrapped Dates: with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema $15-a lot of flavors going on here. You get a mixture of the sweetness from the dates and all the savory goodness from the bacon and a small hint of Italian sausage.  Spicy Italian Sausage Arancini: with parmesan fonduta & pomodoro sauce $16-this tasted like a fried mac n cheese ball to me. Don't get me wrong, it was freakin amazing!!!!!!! Didn't really taste any Italian sausages though.   For our entrees, we ordered: Fregolotto: with roasted rainbow cauliflower, garlic puree, parmigiano, kale pesto, crispy prosciutto $28. This is in the pasta section and it looks and taste like couscous. I enjoyed this very much. The flavoring could be a bit more, but once I added some crushed red peppers, boom! the flavor and the added spice was perfect!  Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib: soft polenta, garden vegetables $52.-Boyfriend was obsessed!!! He's a big short ribs fan so when our waiter introduced a few of the dishes to us, this caught his attention and immediately had his heart set. However....he's someone that doesn't bother looking at the price so when our bill came, he was a little taken back by how much this dish was. Granted, even though he enjoyed it...he didn't feel like short ribs should cost $52. He said at that price....it's worth getting a prime rib!!! By no means does this affect our experience and this review, but just an observation.  Portions were on the small side. I'm a really small eater but I was able to finish my entree....along with the appetizers and bread I ate before that!!! I couldn't believe it!! LOL!! To me, the fancier the restaurant, the less likely I'll have leftovers for the next day...and this girl loveeeesssss her leftovers!! Great restaurant and we will definitely be back....there were a lot of other dishes we wanted to try. Good job Giada, your restaurant is well worth the hype!",

We came in around 6pm on a Saturday night, ordered the orzo meatballs ($14), lemon spaghetti with prawns ($34), scallops (2 for $14), and 28oz ribeye ($83) and didn't even get to enjoy our main course. After waiting 40 minutes for our medium rare ribeye, it arrived nearly well done! Once we brought this to our server's attention another 20+ minutes went by with no update on our steak... no offer of more bread... no apologies.... nothing ! Other tables that arrived after us were receiving their main courses and that's when we ended up canceling our ribeye. So disappointed in the wait staff and kitchen here... one star for the manager comping the entire bill.",

It is expensive (though I didn't pay because it was a business dinner). It is very full service orientated in a classy fashion. Our table jointly agreed on doing the four course option, mostly because we all like food and wanted to try small portions of Giada's signature dishes. This I HIGHLY recommend.  Let me tell you - I have not eaten so well in a long time. Everything is fresh with unique and bold, yet subtle flavors. Pairings of food items accentuate each other. The portion sizes were perfect for a four course entourage, but I still ended up a bit stuffed by the end. I also don't mind reasonable portions and am partial to them in most cases.   The service is wonderful, as expected for a higher end restaurant. Everyone was very amicable and respectable. Never once did I have an issue with my water or wine glass being empty or my requests unfulfilled in a timely manner. The atmosphere is very pleasant. Upscale, but relaxed with phenomenal views.   I would definitely come here again.",

We ordered an appetizer( sm meat and cheese platter) and some drinks plus our main course. The appetizer and complimentary bread tray were uh-mazing. The appetizer had chunks of parmigiana and prosciutto and the bread tray came with fresh bread and baked cheese crackers. Dippings included butter, capers, basil and olive oil. All of these were fantastic.... then came out meal and that's when the disappointment set in. I ordered the risotto with crab and scallops while my husband ordered the fettuccine. Both arrived water logged and bland. The fettuccine, we were warned it would be spicy.... instead it had no flavor at all. No hint of spice. Just watery noodles... and the shrimp... well the had apparently been frozen for a long time. The risotto was watery as well but the scallops were not nearly as horrid as the shrimp. We were starving. We ate the meal though it wasn't worth our time or money. I'm hoping the damn dessert at least cleanses the awful from my pallet.",

For entrees, the lamb chops with barley were exceptional and the crab and scallop risotto sublime. Of course, because Giada DeLaurentiis was trained as a pastry chef, desserts are out of this world! I had strawberry banana sorbetto and white coffee gelato that was the best ice cream I've ever had.

    "text": "Wow. This place has really gone down hill.  We came to Vegas around the time that Giada's first opened. We were so excited to go because we make her pasta sauce at home every time we have pasta. We loved her Vegas restaurant so much that we went for lunch and dinner in the same day.    We then went the day after Thanksgiving this year. It was not difficult to make a reservation, as I made it far in advance.  When you check in, you wait a little bit longer for a table, but nothing too crazy.  She has a little photo booth set up for people to have fun with, and that is a nice touch.  I had a Starbucks coffee with me that I had picked up before I came. I was told that I could not bring it in, which was a little ridiculous, because Vegas.  Chugging coffee was not exactly fun, and not a great start to my meal.  We decided to go with the brunch sampler platter. We were not informed that if you order two of those, then the first two courses come out family style.  We felt like we were being jipped, because it seemed that if one person ordered it, then more food would come out.  A lot of little things kept going wrong, and by the time this happened, my husband went to go speak with the manager.   The waitress was not very warm. I am a sarcastic person, but she was just a little too much for my taste. We felt like we were bothering her whenever we needed something.  I had the pasta, and it was super bland.  Absolutely nothing special. In fact, the sauce we make at home (that is Giada's recipe) is much better. Very disappointing.  My husband had the chicken and waffles...and he wasn't impressed.  The chicken is roasted, and an interesting take on the classic dish, but if you are gonna deviate from the classic, at least make it to die for. Unfortunately, what was memorable was that it was meh.  Dessert was good, however. The lemon ricotta cookies were pretty out of this world.  I am just really bummed about how this place has changed.  Yes, its beautiful, but the quality of the food and the service have really gone down hill since it opened.  We will probably never go back.",

Such a lovely treat! Thank you!  So the food!!! I'm so grateful for the yelp photos to help me along. The dinner menu is quite extensive!! There is so much to choose from! My daughter actually had an anxiety attack when trying to choose!  Pasta? Chicken for two? Veal? Which antipasti should we have? Octopus? Vegetable platter? Cheese and salami? Oh boy! It would be fun to come with 8 people and just order one of everything!!!   First the bread! Yum and yum! And I love the little sides that come with it, sea salt, chili flakes, fired capers, olive oil and soft butter! And the roll was warm. (We just went to the Eifel Tower the night before and the bread and butter were both cold, why?)  For our first share we selected the octopus. OMG- I wish I could replicate this at home, a great chared flavor, cooked absolutely perfectly. The greens that are served with it are just delightful. Fruity and light. Amazing.   Second we had the orzo meatballs. The dish came with 5 large meatballs that were so delicious. The red sauce was so yummy!!! (I almost licked the bowl- bit everyone was watching)  Absolutely delightful!  Our last course was the shrimp spaghetti. Oh so wonderful! This is a perfect size serving for one! I am definitely sad I had to share this dish. Even though I wasn't even hungry after the octopus. The spaghetti was so amazing! And those were not your every day shrimp! I thought I was eating lobster! So absolutely fantastic!  For dessert we chose the tiramisu cheesecake. Quite a display and delicious as well.  Such a great experience! I'm so glad we went. The total for all four items was $88.   For a beautiful experience try Giada.",

Drinks and bartender were awesome! The restaraunt and bar are just gorgeous.  Then we were seated, service was ok, but the sad part was that the food was not.   It was not even average. Started with bacon wrapped dates, which were mushy.   I had rigatoni, not very good, my husband had the spagetti, with shrimp, he didnt like at all.  People next to us  ordered dessert, i casually asked how it was, but she immediately said dont order dessert! , sad to say, but am suprised Giada would put her name on such an average to below average restaurant.   My advice, skip it, Vegas has too many other better options!",

    "text": "Been meaning to write this review since I returned from LV.  Giada (the restaurant not the beautiful chef) is located at the Cromwell on the LV Strip.  Arrived early so naturally nuzzled up to the busy bar and received friendly and immediate attention. Instead of ordering my regular Grey Goose on the rocks I eyed a bottle of Grey Goose XV. The bar tender explained it was being test marketed (95% vodka/5% cognac) and poured a taste. Excellent start to the evening.  Seated shorty after and we opted for the tasting menu. Antipasto selection, to share, was outstanding. My next course was freshly handmade pasta in a lemon crema sauce. Outstanding once again. Moved on to a beef tenderloin that needed no knife ... served with a salsa verde sauce. Service was excellent and while not rushed the timing between servings was spot on. A cart of assorted desserts arrived for the finale. After we each selected a dessert the server said \"c'mon... take another\" and we did. Going be be difficult to visit Vegas again without spending at least one evening dining here again. I'll do it!",

Ours were ice cold and the bacon was like a wet band aid. Gross gross gross. Our meal was alright, honestly not very impressed with the price. I do have to say dessert was really good (Hot chocolate souffle) but the taste of the food, and the service of the staff did not match the prices of the restaurant and we had a 1/3 off voucher.

The best thing I can say is-- DO NOT trust anyone else's review. If I did, I wouldn't have gone here and had as great of a day as I did! Everyone is a critic, even though they have no right to be. It seems like some of these reviews are all coming from people that expected to get foot massages at the table or that got pissed off because they couldn't change around the order like they can at the crap hole restaurant in their home town.

    "text": "Vegas local, first time here and was really disappointed. The food tasted good but the service was SO SLOW. My friend and I work nearby and came in on our lunch break. We had lunch reservations and had to wait almost 10 minutes for our table (which was surprising because when we actually walked into the restaurant it seemed kind of slow and was only about 1/3 full). It then took a while for a waiter to approach our table. And a lot longer to get our drinks (which were served just shy of warm-is there an ice cube shortage?). And then it was even longer to get our food. We ordered off of the brunch prix fixe menu and it was literally at least 20 minutes before we got the first course. Each course thereafter was equally slow in arriving. We basically skipped dessert because we had to get back to work (we were there for 2+ hours!). And then we were overcharged on the bill. The waiter was quick to fix the bill, but still... *Side note-Giada is always ranked as having one of the best views in Vegas. That might be sort of True at night when you can sort of see the Bellagio fountains (which are partially obscured by a pedestrian bridge), but during the day the only view is of the cars passing by at Flamingo and LV Blvd.  *Side note #2-it didn't feel very clean. The overhead fan blades had thick dust on them and the servers would clear tables and leave dirty dishes on a cart right next to our table. I just love eating next to someone else's leftovers.",

Dude my ENTREE had literally 5 pieces of pasta.. So much potential for this place, but as you can see, all the reviews are horrible because it just doesn't deliver the hopes everyone has riding on it. Vegas has such amazing restaurant all around with more realistic entree sizes, and not to mention the all you can eat buffets starting at 15 bucks! I have hopes Giada's restaurant can change though.. she just needs to balance out her menu to reach all kinds of her fans, because they have all loved and supported her. Also, the girls in the dresses at the front were so rude, which really takes away from the experience from the start. Just want to thank God that my career is not being a model because we got a glimpse of tiny tiny baby portions and it was so depressing!!!",

This was great!   Spaghetti: no it's not your red sauce with meatballs. Creamy lemon sauce with 2 prawns on the side. I don't really like shrimp but these were very good. Pasta was very light and delicious. Also $34 for a very very small amount.   Squash crostini: prosciutto and lemon ricotta with squash bits. These were good, but 4 little toasty bits cost me $15!   In the end, the ambience, the presentation and the food made it worth it. Very pricey for the portions though. Oh and the check comes with an iPod which I have no idea what for.",

    "text": "The wife and I started Day 2 in Vegas with lunch at Giada.  We arrived a few minutes before our 11:30am reservations on a Monday.  The restaurant was at the top of the stairs up from the casino floor.  The hostesses were nicely attired in stylish, classy, yet still sexy off-white dresses.  I mention this because the wife liked them enough to ask one of the hostesses if they were restaurant provided uniforms (they were) or something that she bought somewhere in town.  The hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a table by the windows overlooking the Strip (we did), and informed us that it would be a few minutes before our table was ready as the restaurant was transitioning from breakfast service to lunch and some of the breakfast crowd were still finishing.  No worries.  A few minutes after our reservation time, we were seated at our table.  Even though the windows were open, street noise from the Strip was barely noticeable and didn't impede conversation.    The lunch menu was an abbreviated version of the dinner menu with the pasta selections being the greatest area of divergence.  We shared the Wood Roasted Mushrooms with toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata ($14).  In my estimation, it was a bit smaller portion than I would've liked for the price; however, the dish was delicious.  The wife ordered G's Baked Pasta of the Day, which was Lasagna ($24) and came with a small arugula salad.  I had the Tubetti ($24) with caramelized onions and bacon in a carbonara sauce.  Both pasta dishes were nicely executed and flavorful, albeit a bit pricey given their portion sizes.  I'm not usually that big of fan of pasta in carbonara sauce, but this one made me a believer.  My tubetti (which looked suspiciously like penne) came out a perfect al dente.  The sauce was surprisingly light and contrasted nicely with the caramelized onions, bacon, and fresh herbs.  After tasting both dishes, my pasta was the clear winner.  Service was satisfactory as it wasn't memorable, either good or bad.            Frankly, I had reservations about the place.  I hoped for the best, but was prepared for a disappointing experience.  I had nothing to worry about.  Giada was solid.  My only critique was that I thought the pricing/portion sizes weren't well aligned.  In spite of this, Giada is a place that I'd be willing to try again for either lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Hi Giada!  I started my search for a great place to take my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday two months ago.  I found you via yelp and thought that your resturant would be nice and cozy for us for this special occasion. I'm a big fan of you and your cooking style clean,  tasty,  and straightforward.  On top of that,  I loved that your resturant looked like it had the feel of any of the beautiful restaurants we eat back home in Orange County, California.  Not too over the top VEGAS, if you catch my drift.  I mentioned to my good friend that I was considering your place for my boyfriends birthday and she insisted I pay Giada's a visit and recommended I reserve a table by the window.   We dined at your place last night,  and let me tell you,  it was TO DIE FOR!  We started with a drink at the bar, both of our drinks = delish.  Our bartender was warm and very friendly, he offered us tips on how to get into the new nightclub Omnia, and wished my boyfriend Happy Birthday.  We were promptly seated shortly after getting our drinks,  seated at the window overlooking the Strip!  I couldn't have asked for a better view.  Again the resturant had such an at home feel,  it was perfect.    Our server, and co-server were wonderful.  They were knowledgeable of the menu and very friendly.  We started with some olives,  a crostini, a pizette,  and the grilled squid.  I HAVE NEVER HAD SQUID SO AMAZING IN MY LIFE!   My boyfriend and I agreed it was the best we have ever had.   Since we really filled up on the shared plates,  we decided to spilt the Shrimp Spaghetti.  It was perfectly creamy and the fried capers added a dynamic yet simple twist to the pasta dish.  We finished the meal with a little DIY Afigato our server made for us, the espresso was rich and the Gelato was sweet, but not too sweet. A perfect finish to a perfect meal.  The waiter that delivered this to us was so charming,  he gave us a little tip for next time we are in Vegas,  and said you are there often and not to be afraid to stop by just to see if you're there!    Giada - thank you for bringing a fresh feeling to Vegas, I am glad you are here and hope to see more of your resturants opening soon. Preferably somewhere close to home (Orange County, California) so we can be  regulars!    Ciao!  Robby G.",

    "text": "I was so excited to celebrate my birthday weekend with a lunch at Giada. My boyfriend and I got reservations for Sunday afternoon. We arrived right on time and were promptly seated in a table by the window. It was a little sunny but manageable. But then we waited a good ten minutes before anyone came over to greet us or give us water so that was a bummer of a way to start.  But we shrugged it off and moved on to ordering. We started the meal with an order of burrata cheese. It might be my favorite thing we ate there. It was super fresh, really creamy and went very well with the pizza dough bread basket. In addition we had an order of chicken marsala meatballs - also very tasty but a touch on the dry side.  For our main meal we ordered a muffaletta sandwich and a carbonara pizza. The sandwich was loaded with different kinds of meat and it was served with shoestring zucchini, which was kind of like French fries. I really enjoyed the zucchini and the sandwich was tasty as well. While we were enjoying our sandwich we expected the pizza to come out but it never did! I asked our waiter about it and told him we didn't want it anymore. He just said he'd check on it and then came back with the pizza. Which I guess was good but we did say we didn't actually want it anymore so I felt like he didn't listen. They did take it off the bill however, so that was nice.  I was also a little surprised that even though they knew it was my birthday (it was noted with the reservation and the hostess wished me a happy birthday) that we didn't get anything special like a little dessert. I guess they don't do that like some other places.   Overall I'd say the food was pretty good and I loved the ambiance but the service was mixed.",

Our waiter was super attentive to our needs and made recommendations for us since I was there for the first time. One of the major perks was they had a bottomless mimosa for $30 and a regular mimosa was half that cost. They kept the glasses full with champagne so you got your money's worth.  The meal came and it was everything I hoped for. I got a lobster roll and my husband got the lobster hash. The portions were a good size and the flavors were beyond delicious. The only complaint I would have is that some items on the menu weren't explained as well as they could have been. For example, the lobster roll was more like a lobster crostini and the fried zucchini was actually shoestring style. It didn't matter though because I easily finished my entire plate. I didn't have dessert but saw some and they looked incredible. We will defiantly go back. Also, I'd say this isn't the best spot for kids so leave them home if you can.",

    "text": "We made an 8:00 pm reservation on Open Table about a month in advance for a Tuesday night and in the \"notes\" section, requested a window table.  I was called a couple days before our trip to confirm our reservation and was told that I could guarantee a window table if I committed to spending $100 per person on dinner.  I declined.  I guess they try to sell everything in Vegas, but this turned me off a little.  We got to the restaurant about 10 minutes before our reservation and had to wait in the bar for our table until around 8:15.  The restaurant is beautiful, but \"compact\".  Tables in the bar and dining room are very close together and it can be hard to move around.  Our table was by the window, but was behind some window treatment that partially obstructed the view.  Our waiter was not rude, but was really not engaging, as though we were really not that important to him.  (Maybe he knew we were not going to spend $100 per person?)  When I asked about 2 entrees, he did not describe them, he simply selected one for me.  Come to think of it, maybe he was a little rude.  As far as food goes...the bread was OK.  The wine was OK.  The salads were OK.  The entrees were OK.  The service was just OK.  Despite the hype, the place is just OK.  We were hoping for a better experience.  Unfortunately, we probably won't be returning to Giada our next trip to Vegas.",

The way I see it is, for the amount you pay, you better have exceptional food or exceptional service, and Giada have neither. Don't get me wrong , the food wasn't bad, just not any better than other no name Italian restaurant. Service was poor, waitress can't even manage a simple task of refilling drink.  The only thing Giada has going for it is a great local overlooking  the Strip. Wish I didnt' step through this door, at least my admiration for Giada's  (the Chef) cooking prowess would stay intact.",

    "text": "Something inside of me didn't want to like this restaurant but I just do I love it. First my friends tried to make a reservation on OpenTable and there was nothing open for over eight weeks. So I said why not call them I called them and I was able to get a reservation for the evening we wanted but not until 830. They called me to confirm the reservation the day of and the only change I made is I said there will be six of us instead of five of us and the person on the phone said that was fine.  We got there at 7:30 to enjoy a drink in the bar. We were turned away saying the bar was full and to please come back at our reservation time. So we went to bound. See my review on bound. When we came back the hostess very unkindly told us that our reservation was at five not 830. That's when I started to get a little angry. It was just about this time that a manager came over apologize profusely told us to hang out for a few minutes and she would get us one of the best seats in the house. My gosh from that point on it was a completely perfect dining experience. There was a dessert cart right there where we were waiting and there were two people manning the dessert cart and they were very happy to tell us about all of the desserts. When we got our table we were asked if we would like a tour of Giadas kitchen which we took. When we sat down at our table the view was absolutely breathtaking. When I made the reservation they asked if there was any special events we were celebrating. I said we were celebrating several birthdays including my own. The first thing they did was bring us a complimentary St. Germain cocktail which was absolutely delicious absolutely unexpected and absolutely appreciated. The service was absolutely impeccable. We started with the large Caldi platter and the Salumi and cheese platter.  Her menu is broken up into small plates and a traditional Italian course meal. On the Caldi platter you could get some of her best small plates. We had two different kinds of meatballs calamari shrimp scampi eggplant Rollitini fried zucchini and lobster Arancini balls everything was amazing. However we sort of wanted to have entrees too so we ordered the Rissoto with scallops and the tortellini and the pitzetti. It was all fabulous. However I would be aware that these dishes are also very small so if youre hungry get a caldi platter also!!!  It's really worth it! Then the dessert cart rolled around again they took so much attention to details they had written happy birthday in chocolate on our dessert plates. Everything on the dessert cart is six dollars but the best deal in the house is you can try five desserts for $14 which is what we did obviously. We sort of made fun of one of the dessert and so the dessert waiter gave one to us for free just to try it or Maybe because he thought we were funny. Either way it was a perfect way to end the meal. Looking around this restaurant is just beautiful you can see the picture of our view that I posted but the attention to detail is amazing. My favorite thing is her light fixtures say I eat a little bit of everything but not a lot of anything which I think sums up her menu perfectly. I will go back again and again and again and I truly hope this attention to detail this service and the amazingness of the food is in it for the long-haul and not just because it's a new restaurant.",

Also, didn't understand the family style dinner for $120 with a signed picture of Giada.  Just thought that was being too commercial.   Food is good but WAY overpriced even for Vegas for what you get.  We had the chicken marsala  meatballs, burrata,  ricotta crostini, lemon pasta with shrimp and the salmon.  All were good but definitely not worth the prices charged.  Really no standouts here.   Overall our service was great..didn't have any issues with the wait staff on timing of meal and service.   Hostesses were great.  Probably will not go back but glad we tried.",

    "text": "I thought the Cromwell was a very nice hotel!  Upon entering the feeling of quaint and classic is how I would describe it.  Going upstairs to Giadas I can say her restaurant again vey classy, I loved the light woods and the art.  They have an adorable photo booth that you can mark your experience by taking a photo and sharing it on Facebook or send to your email for free.  Very nice touch!  The dining room, kitchen, seating were all very nice.   I loved her napkins with her name on them and all of the dishes used during the service very Giada.  So I was surprised to hear everyday radio music especially when you read her menu and clearly see she wanted an Italian flair and experience.  I'm beginning to think that restaurant owners do not understand that dining can be an experience even for that hour or two where you are taken to another place.  I can get in my car and hear regular old radio music any day of the week.  What you have done is just cut the experience off at the knees. When you could have provided the full take me away dining experience.  Also I was not a fan of opening those huge Windows on Mother's Day when it was still cool outside and all the ambulance noise and traffic.  Slightly disappointed however I am still a Giada fan and hope that their establishment realizes they have the power to provide an experience for your eyes, ears and palate.",

    "text": "The food was not the issue and neither were the drinks. The food itself wasn't anything mind blowing, but it was good. The veal I ordered came out cold. The server was informative and very polite. My biggest complaint is that our actual entrees came out at the 2 hour mark. With only two people at our table, we were expecting to be finished with dinner in about 2 hours. So if I had not boxed up that veal and instead stayed to eat and enjoy dessert, I'd have been looking at a 3 hour dinner. A bottle of wine didn't come out for about 30 minutes, the appetizers came out quickly, but we were left sitting for an hour before I finally ask for my entree, which came out in another 15 minutes. For fairly average food, I don't think I'd wait that long again. Instead, Il Mulino across the street not only tastes better, but actually serves food at a reasonable pace.",

Makes it feel cheap and like I just got off a theme park roller coaster. The portions are tiny and expensive. The spaghetti was good. The caprese salad was not good. The margarita pizza was pretty good, but tiny. They convinced us to order dessert and we got the chocolate cake dessert. Very average, if not below. Dry cake, and ice cream tasted weird and cheap. Would not go back. You def need reservations for dinner.",

Normally, with a super early reservation, comes a lot of expectation which can't be matched. Not so the case here. Read on, friends....  The decor here is very modern, comfortable and chic, all without being pretentious. The view is outstanding and we were lucky to have what felt like the best table in the house. We were sat in a half moon table which had us all looking out over the strip - incredible views of the bellagio fountains and the \"eiffel tower\". We were treated like royalty by our server, who was exactly the right level of friendly vs giving us enough space to enjoy our meal.   I am English, so I'd never heard of this Giada lady who is some kind of TV/social media celeb, right? I still don't know, and I still don't really care. But what I do know is her food is to die for. And it's worth every penny. We went for a mix of antipasti, kind of tapas style. Of particular note - I loved: lobster arancini, the clams, the truffle pecorini cheese, the dates/bacon thing (forgot the name) and then the gorgonzola salad. We had other things to sample, but those were the ones that really stood out for me (although they were truly all absolutely delicious).   This is hands down some of the best food I've eaten in the USA. Maybe in the world. As you can tell from this madwoman review, I really loved it. Ok, enough crazy. Review over. You should go, if you're headed to Vegas and looking for a special or celebratory meal. When you make your reservation, be sure to ask for a table with a view.",

We went in for lunch and we ordered a bottle of prosecco, which was excellent and perfect accompaniment to our meal. The put the bottle on ice somewhere else, which resulted in our glasses running empty several times.   We had the burrata with the balsamic sea salt, it was excellent. It would be nice to receive bread when we got the cheese. We basically sat there starring at the cheese and each other until we received the bread. We also had the orzo meatballs, they were good and quite tiny.   I ordered a salad for lunch with chicken paillard. When the salad came it looked great, but then I started to cut into the chicken, it was so greasy!!! The waiter came to check on us, I chose not to say anything because i didn't want to make a scene of any description. The waiter mentioned how crispy the chicken was and I was laughing on the inside because this thing was so far from crispy. My husband had the lobster roll, it was good, but not what we pictured as a lobster roll. It was like an open faced sandwich.   Overall, not bad, I might go back, but there are many other restaurants in Vegas to try, so it might be a long time.",

I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to drinking... I had the destroyer and WHOA! It was amazing and I'm lucky I walked out of there! A little disappointed that we didn't get to sit in main room with the view. I'm a local so I didn't mind... But for those of you visiting my city... Be sure to ask for it unless you don't mind looking at the escalators on the side of the building. Use the cute photo booth while you wait!",

    "text": "This is a solid 3 maybe closer to 3.5. Giada's is in the new boutique hotel, The Cromwell. It has a very large and open seating area, however I sat at the bar. I hear if you want a nice view of the strip you need to make your reservations well ahead of time, be warned. The bartender is great. Knows the food inside and out, has great recommendations, and has a True passion for the Italian food and culture. A nice touch is he has a business card which is a napkin, great idea.  You can start with fresh baked breads, however I did not have any, they bake it right in front of the restaurant, gives it a nice atmosphere and aroma! I started with the grilled octopus. It was very tender, which I could cut it with my fork and had a nice char on it.  For the main dish I had the rack of lamb, 2 double cut lamb chops cooked to perfection. It was crusted with mustard, which wasn't too spicy, but gave it a nice crust and flavor. It was served with a small spinach gremolata, nice flavor, but you will need more of a side dish. So on the side I had the grilled broccoli rabe with the spicy Calabrian chili vinaigrette. If you like spicy, order extra because it is to die for! The grilled broccoli is a nice touch, as many other Italian places simply saute it and grilling it gives the rabe great flavor.  I would come back for the atmosphere and knowing I will have a good meal. It's not a cheap night out however. With a few glasses of wine and tip I paid $175. If I wasn't in Vegas I may think twice on coming here, I bet in an average town the prices would be a little more affordable.",

We were called on two separate occasions after they accepted the reservation to inform us that we must provide a guaranteed $100.00 minimum per person if we wanted a window seat.  If not we would get best effort at the time of arrival. By the way two nights prior we dined at Ruth Chris.   Requested a window and were seated at same.  No phone calls, no extra charge and no extra drama was necessary.  Food and service was amazing. We declined the up charge at Giada's. We arrived on time - 9:00..  We seated 25-30 min later. Got to watch them seat a single party at the window seat we ate at a year earlier.  Not sure if he provided a guarantee of $200 for the table. Still we enjoy the meal and atmosphere.  We just prefer it to less of a hassle to dine there.",

I had the lobster ravioli, hubby the veal saltimbocca (dry and a touch burnt around the edges). End result, good restaurant but I would not return. Tip: be an assertive diner. The waiter pushed the tasting menu. We knew it would be too much food. He then recommended we share an app, soup, salad, and a pasta and then order our own entrees. Way too much food for us.

It was the Saturday night before the super bowl and our family was excited to get a reservation somewhere on short notice because it is one of the busiest weekends in Vegas. Shortly after we sat down we started to understand why other people weren't chomping at the bit to eat at this place. Me and my uncle ordered a butternut squash soup and it was cold and really and unpleasant dish in general. We both sent it back. It took an hour and a half to finally get the main course. I ordered a branzino dish and it was mediocre it cost 40 dollars and was an extremely small portion as well. My dad ordered a chicken dish for two it was around 60 dollars. It was dry, unseasoned and was literally 2 chicken legs he sent it back. Every person in the family (12 people in total) was unsatisfied with there meal. My father said \" this was the worst dinner I've ever had in Vegas \" that pretty much sums up the experience you will receive if you work up the courage to eat here. Your better off at McDonald's ! The waiter was very nice I'll give them that.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful and classy.  Our night started with three different appetizers that was recommended by our server, Nancy. Delicious cheeses, Burrata, came with an assortment of topping. Arancini stuffed with pea and pancetta as well as bacon wrapped dates were a perfect start. We also had a beautiful Rose Champagne to pair as suggested by their sommelier, Bryan.  Dinner continued with salads and of course pasta. Several of the ladies got her signature spaghetti with shrimp. The size of the shrimp very generous along with their pasta. One of us has the lobster ravioli and crab rissoto, again an excellent recommendation by Nancy. Bryan paired our dinner with a California Pinot Noir and a Cabernet Sauvignon to give us two options.   Lastly dessert shared by 5 of us was the cheesecake tiramisu, with a 20 year port. What a way to end our night.   We had a memorable dinner that exceeded our expectations. Our server Nancy went above and beyond with her attentiveness to our group. This made up for the lack of service we received at Momofuku the night before.  Their sommelier, Bryan, did a perfect job of pairing all of our meals with wine that complimented everything we ate. They pretty much created our own custom tasting menu.   Giada's had been around for a while but clearly continues to be one of the very best on the strip. Beautiful, classy, delicious food, and excellent service, highly recommended. Cheers!",

Loved the digital menu and the couch settings. We did not have reservations- so we sat in lounge area but we were told that reservations would not be available until 3-4 hours. The entire time we sat in lounge couches there were many tables that were available. But we were still impressed before our flight. The egg martini was also a great topper before we flew out!

    "text": "This place is off to a great start considering how ambitious the menu is, how large the dining room is, and how absolutely slammed busy it is every second it is open. The only issues we had were with pacing--all of our smaller plates came out in a hurry, then there was a loooooooooong wait for the final larger plates. Well, there was also a minor issue with the staff not knowing which of the coffees were and were not available in decaf.   The place was full, but we were seated immediately upon arriving for our 7:45 reservation. The room is arranged comfortably and even though it's busy, the tables are far enough apart that there's a busy hum without being too loud. I think you would probably have to be right on the windows to have much Bellagio fountain view, but it was also very pleasant to watch the crescent moon rise over Caesars from our table.   The bread service is excellent, with crunchy breadsticks, a flatbread, and a life-changing rosemary focaccia. It also comes with multiple condiments, like pink Himalayan salt, chili pepper flakes, lemon ricotta and basil pesto. (We actually used the condiments throughout our meal, which was fun.)  For the small plates, we had the oyster crudo, the charred octopus, the chicken marsala meatballs and some of the reggiano cheese. Every one was excellent except the octopus, which was tough in some bites and could have used a bit more seasoning. (But maybe the bar had just been set impossibly high the previous night, when I had the best octopus I've ever eaten at, surprisingly, CarneVino.) The chicken marsala meatballs displaced the albondigas at Julian Serrano for me as the best meatballs in Vegas. If they had been any more moist, they would not have been able to hold their shape and they burst with flavor.   For the larger dishes, we had the lemon spaghetti (with shrimp as big as lobster tails) and the branzino with tangerine glaze. They were both wonderful. We were so full we decided to forego dessert.   Lots of thought has obviously gone into the menu, as there is a wide range of dishes and every plate is beautifully presented on dishware that looks like it was selected to suit the individual dish. Service throughout was smooth and attentive (I think they would rather die than let a water glass be empty) and quite knowledgeable about the menu except for the decaf issue.  Overall, I do plan to go back next time I'm in Vegas. The menu is set up (and priced) so that you can sample a variety of items without breaking the bank. For two people, we had cocktails (love the iPad cocktail menu with pictures), wine, four smaller plates and two larger plates and with tax and tip it was $252. I consider that perfectly reasonable for an event restaurant of this quality in this location.",

    "text": "I've eaten at Giada twice as of this review, and both times we've had a very enjoyable time.  The service is amazing, the food is solid (although there is better Italian in LV in my opinion).  The restaurant has a warm, comforting feel to it.  You enter by taking an escalator up a couple floors to the hostess stand, where it looks like you have arrived to a living room complete with ottomans, a very comfortable couch, and a photo booth (you mean you don't have a photo booth in your living room?!).  As soon as you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a smokey aroma from their open-fire oven, which has permeated our clothing for the rest of the evening.  The first time we came here for a friend's birthday celebration; she's Italian and loves Giada's recipes.  We kind of made a big deal of it to them ahead of time  Apparently that worked well enough to get us arguably the best table in the house, a window table overlooking the intersection of Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd, with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was mid-summer and for some reason the restaurant was quite cold for our ladies, so we had the restaurant open the window to the warm Las Vegas air, which appeased them.  The great service didn't stop there however, as they brought us out every salad on the menu and only charged us for one of them.  They also brought us out every dessert on the menu as well and again only charged us for one of them.  Between our salads, small bites, entrees and desserts the salads were the most memorable.  Produce was very fresh and never overly complex.  The second time was with another friend who loves Giada's recipes and without us making a big fuss about it to them, were sat at a window table overlooking LV Blvd. (view of Caesar's).  This was recent so I actually remember every dish we had.  Baby Sweet Peppers with goat cheese & olive tapenade had a great texture of creamy goat cheese with the crunch of the peppers, the sweet/tangy combo was a great opener.  Orzo Meatballs with parmesan pomodoro, with this I was expecting a little more orzo (pasta shaped like rice) texture, although it turned out just to be a really good meatball.    Parmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey, Sweet Soppressata with garlic & pepper and Bresaola matched up well, probably my favorite \"dish\" of the night, although a little on the pricey side ($40 total).  Lemon wood roasted chicken & creste de gallo soup was a very simple, flavorful \"chicken noodle soup\".  The flavor of the broth transported me back to my youth, when mom would make it on a cold night (which was fitting, since it was hovering around 30 outside).  Arugula salad with candied lemon, crispy pancetta & parmigiano-reggiano, we had this salad before and it was just as good as the first time.  Even though it's just a few ingredients, all of them have strong flavors.  I ordered the lobster ravioli, with lemon butter emulsion, brussels sprouts & pumkin seed gremolata as my main.  Even though our waiter said this was his favorite pasta dish, I felt the flavor a little lacking in lobster.  Perhaps if they added some lobster sauce in with the lemon butter it would've brought it out a little more.  Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente though.  White Cauliflower soup with pickled cauliflower & white chocolate came out last, as we asked our waiter about it during dinner but opted for the chicken soup instead.  We finished up dinner after they were done seating, and the soup was just going to go to waste, so he brought us out a bowl to taste.  The chocolate went well with the nuttiness of the cauliflower, but wasn't overly sweet.  The small bits of picked cauliflower helped cut through its richness.  This restaurant is great for small or large group special occasions or if it's just you and your significant other.  The service will certainly make you feel like you have been personally invited to eat by Giada herself.",

I had the carbonara pizza which had cheese and two fried eggs on top. It was probably one of the most delicious things I've had my entire trip here. I also had a Bellini which was one of the best I have had outside of Venice, Italy. They use real peach puree and it was amazing. One nice thing about this place yelpers is that you can unlock a deal for a free prosecco or plate of cookies. Totally recommend this place.",

We sat and ate at the bar and still received attentive service. I really wish I remembered the bartenders name who was serving us he was seriously incredible. He made us amazing drinks and the cucumber martini he made me was SOOOO GOOD. He told us about how it's his own special recipe that he won a contest for. The food was really top notch. I had the lobster hash and was definitely not disappointed. Big chunks of fresh lobster, an amazing sunny side up egg, and fresh wholesome veggies. Absolutely loved it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles that I also had a bite of and it was really freaking good. You can go wrong and the servers are always around to answer any questions you have. Everything is super clean, and the ambiance is so relaxing even though you're in Vegas. I'll definitely be back!",

A big bread basket comes out with warm focaccia, breadsticks and flatbread. We started off with olives with many different kinda and sizes along with the mini pizzette. I loved the size and taste of the pizzette so that you could get a taste and not be too full for the main. We both got the spaghetti that came with huge shrimp.

Please note that the 3 stars are not at all due to the food itself, but rather for the service. We found ourselves waiting quite long to order, and were rarely checked up on during our meal. Towards the end of the dinner, my girl friends water glass cracked and when it was being refilled it gushed our everywhere and water came down to my side of the table, wetting a few of us. The manager was nice to comp her spaghetti, but all of us were affected at the table as a result of the glass cracking. I would visit again, but hope for a better overall experience.",

While waiting for the table, we took pictures at the photo booth which was cool. When the hostess sat us, she gave us a mini tour of the prep areas where they make the hand made pasta, marinated olives, pizza, focaccia, etc. Everything is fresh and looks amazing!  We had a seat near the opened window, overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountain. Our server was very personable and knowledgeable, I'd expect nothing less. He brought us probably the best tasting focaccia I've ever had, and we ordered the sausage stuffed dates as an appetizer; also amazing. Perfect combination of salty, sweet and spicy.   For the entree, I ordered the branzino and my girlfriend had the spring pea and panceta tortellini. The branzino was perfectly cooked, and the citrus sauce and arugula salad made it very refreshing. The tortellini was fantastic, and I'm not one that likes peas.  Finally, desert came and I wasn't expecting much. We ordered the tiramisu which came in layered shot glasses. My Nonna makes great tiramisu, so I had high expectations. There were three flavors: pb&j, chocolate and blackberry lime. All three were delicious, but pb&j was the best! We ordered mochas as well, extremely decadent and garnished with Giada's signature \"g\" in chocolate. A pretty heavy desert but well worth it.   Overall, just a great experience in terms of food and service. Giada even came to our table and talked with us for a little. Gotta say, it was pretty unforgettable, will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Extremely disappointing! I went for brunch with a group of 7 girls and everyone ordered something different so we could all taste the majority of the menu. The salmon Benedict was definitely the best. Everything else was extremely bland with little to no flavor. We got the pastry assortment as well (probably the best part of the meal). Not only was the food subpar, but the service was absolutely horrible. Lots of sitting around for a restaurant that wasn't even fully packed. Even when we showed up for our reservation, we stood around for 15 minutes while the hostess went back and forth to the table - there were many empty tables at this point! Overall, do not understand the hype and would never recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I was skeptical that this place would be good since it's a celebrity chef's restaurant and they have disappointed me in the past. Boy was I surprised. It was hard at first getting a reservation. We had called months ahead of time and they said it was all full but we can try the day of. The the day of rolls around and we walk in only to be turned away as both tables and the bar were full. So we call the next day, still no luck but the girl on the phone said she would squeeze us in the next day. The day comes and they couldn't find our reservation. But they still took us. Awesome. We got a mini tour of the restaurant and were seated with a great view of the strip. So far so good.  The services was freaking amazing. The waiter was very attentive and personable. The recommendations he made was great. He brought us complimentary toast sized spritzers. (It was delicious) We never had to ask for more water as the cups seemed to fill themselves. When we got up to use the restroom, our napkins mysteriously folded themselves. (I later saw that a waiter had taken away the used one and replaced it with a brand new, folded one) The manager came by a couple of times to check on us. Overall, the service is what I would want from all \"fancy\" restaurants.  Now on to the food. I went with a party that liked to eat, so us 4 girls spent $280 on dinner. We ordered 3 antipasti dishes, 1 salad, 4 entrees and 1 side. The appetizers were really good, we got the calamari, mushroom pizza, and broccoli rabe. The breads were very interesting (in a good way) and the lemon butter was the devil. I just wanted to eat the butter by itself and lick the bowl clean. I forgot what salad we got but it had arugula and parm cheese and it was delicious. For the main course, we got the 28 oz. ribeye (complete with sunny side up egg), the rigatoni, salmon, and the risotto with the side order of lemon potatoes. The waiter recommended trying the balsamic vinegar with the ribeye, which I was hesitant to try at first, but was very glad I did as it was amazing. Everything else was fantastic as well.  I only wish we had room for dessert. We spied it on other people's tables and it was in these cute little cups. We made full use of the photo booth. :)  I can't wait to try more of the menu the next time. This restaurant is now on the top of my list for vegas.",

I ordered the panino with zucchini fries and it was delicioussss. My other friends had some sort of pasta dish but were a bit disappointed since the portions were really small and it wasn't anything extraordinary according to them.  BUT, the best part of it all was when Giada came out!!!! We saw a buncha people and cameramen hovering around this area and people started coming towards that area with their cameras in hand. Then we saw it was actually her and was so starstruck!! There was a line waiting to meet and take pictures with her and she attended and talked to each and every one of us. She is so beautiful and just as nice in person as she is on screen. The nice thing was that it wasn't so chaotic with people pushing and running up to her, everyone was very respectful and waited for her. No rowdiness or anything. THAT, I must say, was the best part of the dining experience =) LOVE YOU GIADA!!!!",

The servers kept serving the other table over my shoulder, their butts on my shoulder and near my face. Had to keep moving to avoid them spilling stuff on me or having their a.. on my face. Had to ask for bread service, serving spoon. The food was adequate but as usual the strip restaurants figure you are an out of town guests and the service is poor, but high priced. Over price for pasta, appetizers. SAVE YOUR MONEY, you are paying for an overhyped TV COOK. Nor worth it. There are other fantastic restaurants on the strip that excel on ambiance, food and service. WYNN comes to mind.",

The restaurant itself is really pretty but the food is just nothing special and definitely over priced.  I don't know if my expectations were too high coming from a famous chef but I could have had better italian food here in LA. The tomato soup was just a regular home made tomato soup without any twist to it and the $25 pastas were just ridiculous expensive for what it was. Is it because this restaurant is meant for tourists who will probably never go back there that it is so disappointing? I am not sure but I will definitely spend my money in another restaurant when I go back to Vegas.",

We had reservations so we didn't have much of a wait (maybe 7 minutes), but we were told dinner reservations are 6 months out and lunch u can do walk-ins but you'll have to wait 30-45 mins.  Our lunch was incredible from the bread all the way to dessert.  I ordered the carbonara pizza and it was the best pizza I have ever eaten.  Someone in my party ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese, which was phenomenal and came with zucchini scapecce, which I had never had before but was awesome...I'd rather eat that then French fries!  Even the bread with the pesto spread before the meal was awesome.  As far as strip restaurants go, it was on par for pricing, if not slightly cheaper for lunch.  I can't wait to go back and try dinner (I should probably make my reservation now!!)  Wait staff was very good as well.",

    "text": "A group of us go to Las Vegas a few times a year, and we always try new top-end restaurants on each trip.  This time Giada was our choice for Saturday night.   The good: The ambiance of the place was great.  The check-in process was very efficient, and we sat in the bar / waiting area and had drinks while we waited for our table (we arrived early to enjoy a drink).  Our table was ready right on time (in fact a few minutes early) and we were seated in the smaller room off the main dining area (which was fine with all of us).    The not so good: First, let's talk about the food.  We ordered a lot of appetizers for the group to try a bunch of things.  It came to the table very quickly - which was great.  In terms of quality though, none of it was bad, but none of it was great.  We all considered it very pedestrian - and I think the best word to sum it up: \"meh\".   Second, we had a party of five people.  We all know that there are a set number of pieces for most dishes (4 pieces, 6 pieces).  Most high-end restaurants we've been will ask us if we would like to have an extra piece made for the group so everyone can try something (and our answer is always yes - regardless of the extra fee).  That wasn't offered here - in fact - the one place we did ask for it - it didn't happen.  We were informed that the standard pizza was cut in to four pieces.  We politely asked if they could have it cut in to five pieces.  Needless to say, our request wasn't well received and sure enough - not 2 minutes later - out comes a pizza in four pieces.  We don't even think the request was passed on given how quickly it came out (nor did the server mention anything about it).  Last, one of our party had ordered a beer and he considered it too warm.  The bottle was reasonably cold - but the beer itself inside was actually quite warm.  He asked if they could please get him another one - and after a brief exchange (I don't think they really understand why he was asking) - they got him a fresh one.  Same problem here - warm inside.  So they took this one and put it in a bucket of ice for a few minutes after we asked again for a cold one - needless to say the problem wasn't effectively solved (and again - no apologies for the inconvenience or offers for something else).    Summary: We had very high expectations (the night before we enjoyed a great meal at a different restaurant) - but unfortunately, this restaurant didn't deliver.  The best I can say was the food was \"meh\" and the service was just OK but certainly not great.  There are a lot of other great restaurants in Las Vegas and I think that Giada's is going to really have to step up the game if they want to compete.",

    "text": "Giada really loves Giada -- and that's not necessarily such a bad thing. The decor is lovely and like spending an evening in her impeccably decorated brain. Everything is light and airy and everything is adorned with either her name or a G. Not four minutes in, I think I heard her name from the hostess or a server at least 10 times.   The food was wonderful, small plates, larger plates, etc.. It is a little on the pricey side but nothing that will really break the bank. It's definitely a place for a nice evening out. The pastas were standout, super tasty, with the lemon spaghetti and JUMBO prawns as particularly delicious.  I loved the dessert cart though the presentation of the actual desserts was somewhat simple. I mean, it's basically just a cookie on a plate. The white chocolate coffee gelato was amazing and I'd definitely go back for more.  Something of note, we were offered \"still\" or \"sparkling\" water -- we took still, inferring that to be plain tap water. Apparently \"Still\" was the name of the ($8) bottled water and it took us two bottles to figure out what was going on. Absolutely not a deal breaker by any means but we joked about our $8 water cocktails we purchased.  With great views of the strip and a non-Strip-like atmosphere, I loved our dinner at Giada and would gladly go back.",

    "text": "First of all, this place is hard to get into. Reservations fill quickly.  They do offer the full menu at the bar, which is seated first come-first served. So you may be able to get a seat there at the last minute.  It took two tries to make this work for me, even though I was alone. My first try was for an early dinner (just after 5pm), but managed to get a seat for lunch at nearly 1pm a few days later.  I sat at the bar, and was quickly and courteously greeted. My bartender/server knew the menu well, and was able to make solid recommendations.  I spent some time looking through the menu. Noticed there was an entire section of cheese plates. Ok, I'm all in.  I ordered the burrata cheese for an appetizer and the Gorgonzola, arugula, and mushroom pizza for my entree.  So, here's my only real complaint: the pizza arrived about two minutes after the cheese. Sure, this is a small plates place, so having them out together isn't a mortal sin, but the cheese should be its own course, IMHO, and I did specifically request that I start with the cheese and then have the pizza.  Watch your timing, guys.  In any case, I went with the burrata because it was a cheese I wasn't familiar with. It's basically mozzarella wrapped around a fresh cream cheese. It was wonderful, and actually lighter than it looked, which isn't to say it wasn't heavy. Just not as bad as it sounds.  Eat it with the toasted Italian bread they bring out. It needs to be spread, not eaten alone (which is how I typically like my cheeses).  Then the pizza. It was a Neopolitan style dough, with a nice balance between the three strong flavored ingredients.  Lastly, as I was going to need some help getting through the day, after nearly 72 hours in Vegas, I ordered a coffee.  When I want to test the espresso knowledge of a place, I ask for a doppio ristretto. My bartender/server had no idea what that was. Disappointing, but not unusual.  So, I asked for a double short espresso, which is the less pretentious version of the same thing. He knew what that was.  Someone else pulled the shot, so it seems like they have someone specializing in the espresso machine. That's a good thing in a place like this, that isn't pulling shots all day long.  According to my bartender/server, Giada herself is in the place at least once a week. Unfortunately, that wasn't while I was there.",

Called to make a reservation but they were booked for the next two weeks. However they have a smaller bar area where you can eat and enjoy the restaurant without reservations (only if spots open up). We went and the timing was perfect-seated at the bar within 5 minutes. The atmosphere inside is beautiful-lots of comforting white with great views, even from the bar.   If you go you MUST order the calamari-it's the best thing on the menu. Perfectly cooked and amazing. The rest of the food was good but not mind blowing. I'd give it 4 stars. The reason for the 5th star is the fact that Giada herself was there, walking around the restaurant (glass of wine in hand). She is tiny and so gracious and even stopped to take pictures with a few people, including our newfound friends from the bar, a Dallas couple with whom we got quite tipsy with (but that's another story). All in all, an awesome experience!",

    "text": "This was our second visit to this restaurant. This time we did not make a reservation and the hostess try to seat us at a table we did not like. There were at least 4 tables by the window so I asked if we could have one. The hostess told us those are reserved for people that make reservations. Finally we picked acceptable table but we were told it need it to be set. We waited 10 minutes and I had to ask the hostess how long is going to take to get a table? There were no apology for anything. The young lady acted like a primadonna. Fortunately we had an excellent waiter and the food was ok. Being vegetarians we wish they had more options for vegetarians!  By the way the last table by the window was still empty til we were leaving and none of the tables had reserved sign we could see that was confusing for other customers as well!",

I heard this was restaurant was not that great by others , but they were wrong. We were given a private room and the balcony off from the room. Joseph was our server what a pleasant person and knowledgeable  We all did the tasting menu and wine parings great recommendation. We also meet the new manager from San Diego very pleasant person.  The food met our expectations knowing Giada for her Italian roots and love of the food.  The service and atomsphere I would tell  anyone who is headed to Vegas this a must stop for  great service good food and will be back again.  Also stayed at the one of the strip hotels and was given a token from Giada's but room service threw it away, I went back and Joseph remembered me and gave me the menu packet from the tasting.  i say what great place I could go on and on. Bravo to you all.",

Good luck Giada I think if someone asks for the dinner menu the waiter shouldn't say nice try!!!!",

When we got to our table we weren't greeted for maybe 8 mins. Those things aren't the end of the world, just saying. The food was great. Scallops & Crab risotto main course was really good. The shrimp scampi and calamari appetizers very good. Waiter was very knowledgeable. Manager touched down at our table to introduce himself.  We also sat at the window and had a great view of Ceasars, Bellagio and Vegas strip. Overall good experience.  Would recommend and would go again.",

    "text": "We went to Giada for my husband's birthday. Our hostess was very friendly and we were seated right away, I had made reservations for 8 pm. The restaurant is lovely with a great view where you can see the Bellagio fountains. Our server Rocco was amazing, very attentive and passionate about the items on the menu. He brought us a complimentary Prosecco which was a nice touch. We started with Tricolore salad, it was fantastic and quite a large size. Then we had the Lobster Arancini and the Fritto Misto. Both were very nice, the marinara that is served with the Arancini makes the dish it is light with a spicy taste at the end. The Fritto Misto has a very nice light crunchy batter, not greasy just right. My husband and I shared the Spaghetti and the Scallop Risotto. The Spaghetti was delicious and my favorite of the two. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the fresh pasta was great. The sauce is a creamy lemon sauce that is not over powered by lemon. I highly recommend this dish. The risotto was also great, scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was nice and creamy. Only thing that I can kind of complain about is that they knew it was my husband's birthday and they did not bring him a little dessert but it's ok haha.",

My napkin was dirty my wife's flatware was dirty. The food was terrible... I repeat terrible. Stouffer's makes a better lasagna.... My wife's gnocchi could have traded places with a lean cuisine.... The portions for the price were atrocious.... Oh and the $8 addition of chicken ammounted to two cubes about half an inch thick and an inch across. Unless Giada is launching a new line of frozen dinners and this was the test, this place will be out of business soon!",

The restaurant ambiance is light, white and bright! We had reservations at 5 pm last Sunday before our show so it was a great time to enjoy light traffic in the restaurant.  We loved the appetizers: orzo meatballs, burrata cheese and a few other items! yum!  Of course, we tried the lemon spaghetti with shrimp which was like everyone suggested GREAT!  Then the finale of the desserts tray came by- yum! The nipples of venus were little truffle balls and we also shared a fruit tiramasu which was tasty. Enjoy a great time and experience! The nice touch was that the manager came by our table for a personal introduction which you don't see much anymore.  Last note, the max for wine corkage is two bottles per table.",

    "text": "There are some excellent \"celebrity\" restaurants, and there are others that the only thing going for them is their celebrity... this would be one of them.  The reason for giving them 2 stars was to acknowledge the beautiful atmosphere of the restaurant. That's the \"positive\" side of the story. When making the reservation, to get a window table you had to \"guarantee $100 per person food/alcohol\". We were a party of 4. It wasn't that the $100 per person was a issue, it was the *principle\" of the presentation. I have NEVER been to a restaurant that wants guaranteed sales dollar volume for view seating. THE FOOD: Appetizer of cheese filled mini-roasted peppers. This was a huge disappointment. Wasn't even warm. Room temperature. We had other appetizers that were \"good\", but certainly not \"gourmet\". The main course entrees (steak/shrimp, Vegetable Bolognese over Rigatoni, two side dishes were all barely above room, temperature, barely warm. Completely unacceptable.  I ordered a Belvedede Martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. The must have searched the globe for the smallest olives on earth. Anyone who drinks martinis knows they are to use jumbo (queen) olives, and hand-stuff with bleu cheese. Of the two desserts served, one was outstanding, the other one (kind of a layered cake) was cold and near-tasteless. We asked our server how many days a week Giada was there. She said \"about once a month\". Even Wolfgang Puck makes regular rounds of his restaurants I frequent. Once a month means -to me - that we have Giada recipies but no Giada.  So, another overrated restaurant with high prices, small portions, and food that's not up-to-par nor consistent. There is simply NO excuse for food coming out lukewarm. Las Vegas has many outstanding restaurants such as Alize at the top of the Palms, Charlie Palmers at the 4 Seasons/Mandalay Bay, Capital Grille, and a bevy of other choices. The only restaurant is Las Vegas that this beats-out is the Eiffiel Tower restaurant at Paris Hotel, which is so ridiculously priced it's insultive. This reviewers opinion is that there are many other fine restaurants to choose that this one, unless all your after is a beautifully decorated interior.",

    "text": "Wow, impressed and doubly impressed that it is by a celebrity chef.  All reviews from celeb places are \"ugh, really overrated\".  Well done...service, food, atmosphere, view, price point.  Kudos and I am sometimes hard to impress.  We were under $200 for a party of four.  We ordered the Chicken Meatballs, which were good, but I wouldn't order again, just because nothing special...everything else was special.  Really everyone couldn't agree on a better app.  Entrees...filet and lamb chops....the temperature and flavor on both of these were beyond excellent.  The lemon shrimp pasta...excellent.  The barley entree was good, but I am just not a huge barley fan.    The bread basket was served with this piping hot rosemary buttery bread in an oven hot baking dish.  Butter had lemon zest and dipping oil was flavored as well.    Desserts deserve big kudos.  The strawberry polenta cake was a take on strawberry shortcake, but it held the integrity of the original, but was set apart and creative and fresh.  Very hard thing to do with a traditional recipe.  The jam, the cake....delish.  The tiramisu trio were excellent as well.    Sides....the corn/sausage was very unique and I enjoyed thoroughly.  Others thought too spicy, but never for me....could have used less sausage, only because I am not huge on sausage and would rather have more corn.  Thought the combo was unique and the sauce was excellent.  The polenta cakes were excellent as well.  Crispy on outside, creamy on inside.    Service was beyond excellent.  Waiter was spot on, funny, attentive, informative.  View of strip and bellagio fountains.  Four stars.  Attention to detail in design and layout, four stars.  Beautiful glassware, awesome silver ware.  Presentation...delivered....food quality....delivered.....price point....good for upscale dining.    I only somewhat knew Giada as a celeb chef with some food network shows.  Definitely a fan now.  Oh, and I had read in the review that her grandfather was a movie director and that her family also owned a pasta factory before WWII.  Her grandfather's movie posters were presented as art in the entrance.  Classy and True to a good heart....family first always.    The walk through of the kitchen and antipasti bar was also a nice touch.",

We were a party of 6 on a Friday night and as I looked around the dining room, there were many tables that had not been cleared and cleaned.  When we finally ordered wine, I told one of the managers that we had waited for 45 minutes for anyone to attend our table and his response was thank you for telling me---Not even a I'm Sorry.  Food was alright, but having to wait a long time was very sad.  Will not be eating here again.  Beware!",

The Destroyer and Hannibal were my personal faves. They packed a great punch and had unique presentation. In an effort to try as much on the menu as possible, we ordered a few things and shared between the table. The vitello tionnato crostini and orzo meatballs were a highlight for me and the tortellini was the best pasta I have ever had. The pea and pancetta filling was bright and crispy. The individual items are small to medium in portion size and the prices are a little high, but it's well worth it. Bar and wait staff were top notch and the view of the Bellagio is to die for.",

We had a great table with a view of the strip.   The food was honestly just ok.  While decent for a meal,  it was just that,  sustenance.  It wasn't an experience.  We ordered the following: 1. Prosciutto and parmesian crisps $11: tasty combination. American breakfast with meatballs $19 disappointing and nothing memorable, you'll need a glass of water as they're on the dry side.   2. Strawberry waffle: standard served with nutella. Couldn't tell if it was homemade or from the jar.  4 pieces for $18. Opt for 4 boxes of leggos and stay home.  Mixed bakery: yogurt cake - nice.  Monkey bread - nice and sweet  3. Brunch tasting $45: Nice antipasti selection.  Bakery items: was it a scone or fingerprint cookie (couldn't tell).  It made for a good cookie. Main course -chix and waffles - waffles light and crunchy, go well with syrup.  Chix could use moisture.  Pass on the souffle. Ms. DeLaurentiis should redo her recipe. Again,  was confused about whether it was a citrus souffle or egg custard?  The tasting menu gives you a few alternative; you might do better with the other dishes.    Overall,  highly disappointing meal as there was nothing to make us want to go back, unfortunately.  This is Vegas and we want to be wowed.  It just doesn't feel like the effort is being made.  Put meals on a plate that resemble authentic Giada style. At this rate,  Giada's better hope Vegas continues to bring in unsuspecting tourists willing to pay high pricey for standard to substandard meals.  Hopefully it's around long enough to make needed changes. Hopefully Ms. DeLarentiis actually reads Yelp.",

Drinks were forgotten,  no refills offered & when we did get the bill, not only did they charge us for our table but also added someone else's table to our bill.

Food wise, my margarita flat bread was good (though not amazing); the same can be said for my partner's lemon grilled cheese. The shaved zucchini(?)/potato \"fries\" were really creative and delicious though.  It is worth noting that the portions are relatively small, but that wasn't the worst thing in the world given the amount we had gorged ourselves elsewhere during the vacation. Moreover, the price was exceptionally reasonable for the Strip -- with a 20% off coupon our bill (for two) came to around $25. It absolutely makes sense as a place to get a nice casual lunch for a reasonable price if you're recovering from a food orgy the night before (a not-uncommon problem for Vegas vacationers!).",

    "text": "I'm grading on a curve here, but for a restaurant this expensive (the most expensive Italian restaurant I've ever seen) I just wasn't all that impressed.  First, the good:  A diverse menu of Italian dishes, meant to be enjoyed over at least three courses.  A nicely appointed room, with a great view of the Strip -- Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio across the street (somewhat marred, on the night we dined, by the massive fatal car crash just down the street; but that's hardly Giada's fault).  And, Giada really knows how to pack the flavor into her dishes.  My bacon wrapped dates, crab crostini, and tricolore salad all screamed their respective flavors.  But, there were some aspects I didn't care for.  First, the food is rich, rich, rich, even for Italian.  Even though I only had two appetizers and a salad, I felt bloated on the way out; and I can usually pack it away.  Second, the relentless emphasis on Giada's name.  Our waiter only mentioned her about two or three dozen times.  The plates, menu, and even the towels in the bathroom were emblazoned with \"Giada.\"  I've never seen anything like it at any other celebrity chef restaurant, and I've been to a bunch of them.  Third, and I really don't know how to explain this, but the atmosphere just didn't feel comfortable to me.  The dining room is a little bit crowded and a bit of a maze to get through.  The menu is a slightly difficult to figure out, and the waiter wasn't that much help (the answer to every question about the menu was a story about how Giada loves this or that dish).  And the presentation of every dish was, kind of \"Wow!  Look at me!\"  In short, everything was just a little bit overwhelming, and I guess my mental image of Italian food is of comfort food in a homey environment, so it just felt a little off to me.",

We were given a brief tour of the place first and then taken to our seats. Our server was amazing. He was fun and informative and offered suggestions. EVERYTHING On the menu looked and sounded AMAZING!! Unfortunately it's going to take 5 visits to be able to try it all!! I can say the bacon wrapped dates and orzo meatballs were fabulous starters and the rigatoni with vegetable bolognese was incredible for a pasta! We did also try the trio of tiramisu and the plate of cookies, both delicious and a great finish to the meal. Giada's has knocked it out of the park. She was even there working the line and came out to greet customers!! Amazing evening and I cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "We checked this place out on our first stay at The Cromwell. Yelp reviews looked good....I say \"meh\". The antipasto dishes were the highlight but that was the only thing that was great. For antipasto we had the wood fired mushrooms which were excellent and the bacon wrapped dates which were also great. Next we tried a couple of their pizzettes - the Margherita & the Mortadella. These were both solid. Then we got to the pasta....Bucatini (my favorite kind of pasta), Ravioli & Tortellini. The Bucatini was not Al dente at all and was a pretty soft texture. Also the pomodoro sauce they used was just too saucey/thick and didn't have great flavor. The Ravioli had a flavor that made me think of Thai food and the only one I cared for was the Tortellini which was a pea/pesto sauce with pancetta. Dessert came around on a cart that we waited about 10 minutes for after our meal while tables in front of us had their look at it. We had one of the tiramisus and another chocolate dessert. These were pretty good and we didn't get charged for them so I'm not sure if dessert is free at this restaurant or if this was just an error. Now for the service. What really annoyed me was our waiter immediately turned into a less than mediocre waiter / snob after we didn't order wine and decided not to order a lot of entrees. All said and done, the bill was $153 pretip / $183 after tip which is pretty high considering these are all extremely small portions and we ordered no drinks at all & no entrees. Not sure why I gave this guy a full 20% tip. I doubt I would come back for a complete meal but would consider stopping in for a quick bite of their antipasto dishes if in this area of the strip.",

Dumb, I know. Two completely different chicks. But when it came out as a tiny piece of OK lasagna, it was a let down. And sooooooooo overpriced. We ended with tiramisu, hazelnuts on top. It was good. I guess I just expected more. Maybe that's not fair but to spend $115 on lunch for small portions, when they make such a big deal about sharing/family style, it made me scrutinize the food. Oh, and the G on everything? Yeah, we get it. It's your place, Giada. But I love your humble/shy side. I'd expect it from Guy, not you.",

They didn't seem to care. No one even mentioned the birthday and our seats had zero view.   Unfortunately, this attitude permeated through the whole staff. The service was terrible. We were there on a quiet Wednesday night and the restaurant wasn't crowded and it still took 40 minutes until we even got a drink!  That's with a reservation.   The only reason this gets 3 stars is the food is excellent. The bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer were the best we ever had. (I can't remember our other app).  We both had pasta as a main, the spaghetti and fregolotto and both were very tasty but the portions were small - appetizer size.   It then took another 20 minutes to get the check and get out of there - because we didn't want to hang around for coffee with no view and bad service.   So to sum up - tasty food, smallish portions and terrible service.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Giada from watching her on the Food Network so I just had to swing by and give her restaurant a try. My boyfriend and I decided to have our last meal in Vegas here before we left. Upon reading other Yelp reviews I was worried we wouldn't be able to get a table for breakfast without a reservation but we gave it the college try anyway. Upon arriving, the hostess greeted us and said it would be a 5- 10 minute wait. We were relieved we could get a table on short notice and she suggested we could go to the bar and hangout while we waited for our table. When we got to the bar, we noticed the restaurant was nearly empty and wondered the reason for the wait. The bartender was very personable and greeted us as soon as we sat down. We decided we would just order at the bar and eat there since there was no point in waiting for our table in an empty restaurant. The only reason I deducted a star. I ordered the Sunrise Waffle which was absolutely delicious. The perfect balance of sweet and savory. My boyfriend ordered the Carbonara Pizza which he kept raving about. I was lucky to get a bite of it and it was delicious as well. We loved the food and the decorum of the restaurant...very LA and chic which suits Giada's personality. Aside from the seating ordeal, we will definitely come back for the food...perhaps for lunch or dinner next time.",

It is an intimate and very classy setting...something you would except of Miss Giada.    The food was good.  Not great.  Sauce was a bit acidic and salty.  But the pasta was freshly made.    Did I mention we went for brunch?  There are no brunch items.  There is a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  Weren't aware of that going in.  Pasta at 9am is a bit strange...but I'm Italian, so I'm game.    The portions are small.  Also a Giada trademark.  So if you are starving and a foodie and don't want to pay $40 for a tiny bit of pasta...then this may not be the place for you.   That said, overall it was good.   We were extremely impressed with the management.  While waiting, a waiter sneezed and covered his mouth in \"vampire\" fashion.  The manager told him to wash his hands very strictly.  He tried to explain that his hands didn't touch his mouth, but before he could finish, the manager in unison with another of the wait staff said again, \"WASH YOUR HANDS.\"  Cleanliness is much appreciated and often overlooked!",

The hostesses and waitress were very polite and helpful, the view of the strip for people watching or watching the bellagio water show is excellent; I kind of like it better then from some restaurants higher up. We brought our newborn but it does not seem like a place for older kids. Even though I only I had a few sips of the champagne(sparkling wine, I don't think it I from champagne France,) it was amazing, not too fruit forward and not too tannic but very strong. The waitress told us that Sunday brunches feature bottomless mimosas that are made with that sparkling wine. The prices are a bit steep but it seems you pay for the ambience of the room and being so close to the strip as well as the wine; we will be back to give the food a second chance at dinner or lunch. There is valet and self parking on the east side of the Cromwell and the restaurant Is on the west side right next to the strip.",

Our waitress, Lauren, was very charismatic and gave us a really good overview of the menu. The menu items are very pricey; however, the food was delicious and well worth it. I highly recommend the Mortadella with focaccia bread for an appetizer. I loved the arugula salad. The Parpadella with pork was delicious .  You must definitely order The roasted corn and potatoes as a side ... You won't regret it. I loved the roasted Banana ice cream with chocolate gelato... Yum.

First, lovely atmosphere. You take an escalator to the place and it is a nice scenic restaurant. At the recommendation of the bartender I had a salmon sandwich with avocado. I waited just over 20 minutes at the bar and got a salmon that was not cooked. I can't stand raw food. Honest mistake I guess as I assume if I'm ordering salmon on a sandwich with avocado it would be cooked, and the fact it took over 20 minutes it should be cooked or out sooner. Anyways they were nice and took it back. For the price and atmosphere they should have an appetizer such as bread or something. There could be more to choose from in my opinion on the menu, but the pizza is one thing I want to try and will come back to test it out. This place isn't bad, it's just not great either and I probably had my expectations too high.",

    "text": "Ah Vegas. Land of the buffets or my personal favorite...beer in a football container! Once in awhile though, you should class it up and have a nice sit down dinner! When you do, Giada should be one of your top 5 places to go!  I'm sure you've read the other reviews about how everything is fresh & delicious. Basically it's True. You cannot go wrong with ordering off the menu (even the drink menu!). If you have doubts, ask your server who is very attentive to your needs.   When we visited in late July, we were fortunate enough for Giada to be there. (If she's there, you get a small glass of Prosecco) Even more fortunate was that she made rounds and stop by our table to see how things were going and took a picture with us! She truly seem interested to make sure we enjoyed our experience even though I bet she was tired being one of the later dinners of the night (9:30 reservation..she probably came by around 10:30p)  My only gripe is that some of the tables are really close together (in the area we sat there were three small couples table together). So that was a little bit of a drag. It's not like the other couple was annoying, but sometimes you need some personal space! So keep that in mind, or so show up in a group of 4 :)  A first class dining experience through and through and the price reflects that! Also reservations are really hard to come by (not a surprise) so reserve early! We will come back again (after I hit the tables and win enough to cover dinner!)  One last tip, for an after dinner/dessert drink, get the cappugiro. Absolutely fantastic!",

One immediately asked if we had a reservation. We didn't. It was spur of the moment. She said we could sit at the bar for a couple minutes and then we'd get a table. The whole restaurant besides the bar was empty. Two gentlemen were behind the bar. One who was in our area didn't take our order. The other one did. Whatevs. We ordered a Bellini and a mocha. His mocha came out with a G on it. You go, girl. By this time our friend has joined us. Then I noticed people being seated. I asked the bartender what was going on. Then a hostess walked up-not for us. The lady never put our name down. It sounded like she did it a lot by the way the bartender reacted. Any hoot, we got seated. Awesome view. Our waiter was slow but eventually we ordered the Strawberry Polenta Waffle, Breakfast American, and Italian Chicken & Waffles with Cacciatore sauce. My waffle-little dry but still good. My friend asked for over medium eggs. Damn near raw still. She asked the waiter for new eggs over hard this time. She got her over medium eggs this time. Her meatballs were amaz-balls. The best meal was my boyfriend's. The Italian chicken was juicy and the waffles were cooked to a light crisp and it all paired well with the cacciatore sauce.",

We were brought in right at our reservation time, we took the tour/walk thru of the kitchen, antipasta and pasta area. We were sat in the dinning room with a nice view of the hotels across from the Cromwell. I loved the decor in the restaurant, it was nice and bright, I don't enjoy dining in dark restaurants. An iPad with the drink menu was brought to us, and a delicious bread assortment. E decided to order the chefs tasting menu, 1st course of an antipasti plate with bacon wrapped figs, a tuna crostini and goat cheese stuffed peppers came, it was so yummy I forgot to snap a pic while the dates were still on the plate. Then the 2nd course came I had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp (first let me say it was so yummy and the portions were so large I could have stopped there and been satisfied, also the shrimp were cooked perfect and they were so huge I had to cut it into several bites) my husband chose the vegetable bolognese that was super yummy and it tasted so hearty that you would have sworn there was meat in it. 3rd course was the salmon with edamame and a mustard sauce, this was so delicious and moist cooked perfectly, hubby got the lamb chops, I can tell you I don't eat lamb and these babies made me change my mind, so tender and mild tasting. You also received chorizo corn and lemon Parmesan roasted potato side dishes with the main course.I ordered an iced tea and a gentleman brought over a freshly steeped pot of ginger pear tea that he poured over ice for me and gave me some agave syrup to sweeten it, delicious. The 4th course was dessert we got a blackberry and lime mousse, 2 chocolate peanutbutter and jam cookies, and almond cake with a fruit topping and 2 gelatos a berry one and a white chocolate one, every one of these desserts were excellent, but we were so full at this point. The best part of the tasting was that we got a take away of recipes from the dishes we had and an autographed photo of Giada.      I was so impressed with this restaurant, yes it's pricey but it's Vegas we expect that from the celebrity eateries.",

But my main reason to go there was for what I thought was going to be great food and what a major disappointment that was. I consider myself a big foodie and I have to say that the food/recipes just didn't work at all and the dishes that were \"good\" were just ok... We had no less than 12 dishes and they all kinda suck. I think that it's really hard to mess up italian food if you are a chef but I guess it can be done after all.  Another thing that was really disappointing was the overwhelming menu. Like I said, I'm a well-versed diner and that menu was waaaaaay too much. Took me and my friend,  who is also well-versed in dining out, about 30 minutes to oder. And we ended up going with a lot of their signature dishes/recommendations from the waitress and it wasn't good.  And for my last comment, the service was \"too good\" if you can call it that. The personel was always at our table making it a bit difficult to carry a conversation.   I would love to give it another try later on if they change their menu but I would not spend my money on what's on that menu now. I would only go for the ambiance, the view and the drinks!",

We arrived about an hour early to check out the bar.  Our lovely bartender gave us the interactive menu.  We went with Giada's favorite - The Destroyer with Azul Reposado and Basil.  Delicious and refreshing!  Our server was Valentino and yes, he lives up to his name sake!  He was assisted by awesome Joe.  Muuuuahhh - we love you both. We started with Bacon Wrapped Dates with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema. OMG!  Next was the Crispy Oysters Rockafeller with baby spinach bread crumbs & pancetta vinaigrette.  Delicious! Our third appetizer was the Vitello Tonnato with veal loin, seared tuna, and caper aioli .  This was my favorite - the combination of the flavors was perfect!  They opened the windows.  The noise from the famous corner of Flamingo and LV Blvd actually added nicely to the atmosphere of the open dining room.  Before our main course, we were treated to a prosecco and St. Germain cocktail to cleanse our palates.  It was so delicious that I ordered one with Hendricks Gin!  My friend had the ravioli.  It was fantastic -  perfectly cooked pasta and filled with sweet lobster.  I had the Colorado (my fav) rack of lamb.  The lamb was perfect, melt in your mouth and not gamey at all.  The crunchy coating was delicious.  Our side was the asparagus with lemon ricotta.  Grilled perfectly!  For dessert, we had the three Tirimisu combo.  Heaven!  We order the Nutella coffee which was delicious!  Giada stopped by the table.  She is so amazing!  She hit the jackpot in Vegas with her first restaurant!  We are so lucky to have her! Note: I want those dining room chairs - they are sooooo comfortable!",

We did the chefs tasting menu so we could sample one of everything and I've got to say there wasn't a food I didn't like on it. Some of my favorites on the menu but not all of them cause that would take awhile to write down were the lemon spaghetti w/ shrimp, the salmon, pea tortellini, the bacon wrapped dates w/ sausage, fried potatoes w/ cheese and the trio of desserts. Sounds like a lot but there was three of us so we sampled a little bit of each dish till the food was gone. Living in vegas I will be back again and again.

I ordered the lemon spaghetti because of all the reviews I read about how delicious it was, and it was worth the hype. I also ordered the bacon dates. Perfectly paired with a combination of sweet & salty. The olives were just a great as the olives I gorged on in Florence. The proscuitto was absolutely fabulous! It was perfectly cured. Perfectly salty and a great balance of fat in the pieces. My friend had the lamb and it was so incredibly tender that it was like butter in mouth. The lobster ravioli was obviously made from fresh lobster, I could tell by the taste. We ended the evening with the pistachio cake and white chocolate gelato.",

The restaurant is gorgeous--bright, chic, with lots of personal touches.  Server Elena was excellent.  I went for breakfast and had coffee and the Caprese Frittata, which was unfortunately overcooked. I got a spongy egg patty with raw caprese elements sitting on top.  Usually a frittata has the non-egg ingredients incorporated into it, so that's what I was expecting.  The patty had sundried tomatoes cooked in it which was kinda weird with the fresh tomatoes on top.  There are so many other restaurants in LV that I'm not sure I'll make it back to this one.

    "text": "We had planned on attending Giada and was even more so excited to do so when we were able to get a TravelZoo voucher for some additional $-savings. We were not disappointed. While the menu seems large, your 'captain' or main waitress/waiter guides you through it. We opted for the tasting menu which was just the right size and added cocktails (the Giada cocktail was amazing). Dessert cart was so-so (one of the reason I'm knocking a star as I think a strong finish to a meal is important) but honestly, we were so full that we happy to not waste anything too tasty! The service is what sold us though. My mom is not a fancy-food or dining person and the waitress made her feel comfortable and helped her understand everything on the menu which I think really made it special for her. The waitress also mentioned Giada comes in every 3-4 weeks to check-in on things or make menu changes so we were just missing her by a few days but fear not, because she gave my mom an autographed photo + small folio of the tasting menu and some recipes! Will definitely be returning!",

On arrival, although the restaurant was half empty, the Hostess refused to seat us at a table, allowing bar seating only! The hostess made it very clear that without the \"requisite\" reservation only bar seating was allowed. This makes no sense when a restaurant is only half full and it is obvious there are not enough reservations to fill the space! The food was delicious but the pretentiousness left a bad taste.",

The Barbarella was fantastic and I'm not much of a ginger fan. The white sangria was just okay. I probably would skip that next time.  We ordered the tasting menu from the appetizer which came with an array assortment of salami, cheese, lemon honey, olive, bread and vegetables.  I would highly recommend. It was $24 and big enough platter to be shared by four people we took half of our left overs home. For our entrees we had the salumi pizza and the muffuletta sandwich. And finished our meal with the Zeppoles italian donut for dessert.  Everything we ordered had wonderful presentation and was delicious. Service was outstanding also.  Overall, We enjoyed our experience very much, not to mention the beautiful view you get with your meal. Will definitely be back to bring family and friends.",

It's an expensive restaurant and you should expect the best service. Our servers were great and the food excellent. Please Giada train your Hostess on Sunday 2/18/2018 to be more courteous as expected for a  5 Star restaurant. We were there with a party of 11 and she was really rude. Her attitude when we were told to wait was really bad. A simple \"I'm sorry your table is not quite ready\" would have sufficed . Instead she made us feel really like we were bothering her. We will tell our friends about this experience. With so many options in Las Vegas, spend your money at other restaurants.",

We tried it several times and were pretty disappointed that it was broken. The decor of the place is amazing. We get seated and everyone there is so friendly. I love that about a restaurant. Our waitress was extremely helpful and she was always there when we needed.  When waiting for our dinner, you get complimentary bread. The Rosemary bread was delicious and warm. The perfect bite for me would contain a decent amount of butter, a spread of pesto, capers, and salt and pepper. Haha I honestly enjoyed the complimentary bread a little better than dinner.  Here's what we ordered;  Risotto with crab and scallops. 3.5/5. Scallops are my favorite. It's sad when you order it at a restaurant and it doesn't live up to what you think it's going to be. The dish was lacking salt and pepper. Any seasoning really. I mean it was good. But it definitely needed a little help. I wouldn't spent that much and order that again.  Three cheese tortellini with braised beef and Genovese sauce. 3/5. This dish was super salty. Super super salty.   Whole roasted chicken cacciatore style. 3.5/5. Some of the chicken was really dry.. And also hard to chew. I almost spit some out. The tomato sauce was served with very delicious though. The fresh tomatoes inside of it helped me to not notice how dry my chicken was.  Dessert; Chocolate Tiramisu cake. 4/5. Pretty good! It was very chocolatey though we couldn't finish it.   We also got cookies on the house served on a plate that said happy anniversary. It was so cute! I didn't really care for the cookies at all though. We also got served some espresso from Caitlyn at the espresso bar. She's the best!   I would come back again to see how my new experience would be. If it weren't for the great service I had, I would give the food 3/5. But overall 4/5 :)",

As a former Opera singer and traveler of numerous countries and have truly eaten at many amazing restaurants in San Francisco, New York, ant Italy I can honestly say this restaurant has the most delectable and mouth watering food I have ever tasted! I went with my family and we ordered the tasting menu. Every item on the menu was delicious. Giada, please open up a restaurant in Los Angeles. I will come every week! I look forward to eating here again soon! Giada truly knows how to blend ingredients together to create food from heaven!",

Service was definitely 5/5.  We were there with a large bachelorette party.  We didn't get seated for a good 30+ minutes after our reservation, but we were late, so our fault.  BUT!  There's a photo booth tucked in the waiting area with FREE photos.  HOLLA!  Needless to say, you can have a little too much fun with that.  Once we were seated, we had a couple of guys (wished I remembered their names!!!) who waited on us and were super awesome.  They gave us complimentary champagne and kept it flowing all through dinner and even brought out a surprise dessert for the bachelorette.  The whole night was just a lot of fun, thanks to our wait staff!!  We had requested to be seated near the windows, so we could see the view, but unfortunately that did not happen....but the restaurant itself was really pretty and classily decorated.",

    "text": "Slow, Expensive and Rude.  Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?    I have been there six times, my bad.  Every visit has involved some experience that left us unhappy.  Last night will be my last.  It was over 1/2 hour before we got wine (we brought it, but that's another story).    It was 1 hour 45 minutes before we got entrees.    The manager's head was somewhere dark and warm.  An aggressive jerk who not only lacked empathy, but was combative.   He acted like we should be happy to be there because of \"the lady's name who is on the restaurant.\"   I have to think that lady would be appalled at the horrible service, lack of compassion and bad attitude.     The sommelier was colder than the chardonnay.  She was a pretentious and bitchy millennial.  We brought our own wine, happy to pay $35 corkage for wine we know.   But our party of 8 was surprised with an unpublished 'rule' of two bottles per table maximum.    On a previous visit, we had two servers continuously circling the table, topping off our red and white wine with $150 bottle Italian wines like they were playing duck duck goose.  I expect this restaurant to be around for a while.   Millions of housewives pilgrimage to worship Giada's apron strings.  So the demand is inelastic for $30 spaghetti from a celebrity chef served slowly with wine you have never had at $100/bottle and up.   But I, and you, do not have to be another lemming.  Vegas has too many great options.  Caio Giada!",

    "text": "Oh Giada. You let me down...  My friends and I came here for a late dinner earlier this year because our friend Crystal W. is a huge fan of hers and really wanted to try out her restaurant. We got there a little before our reservation time so we could use their photobooth. I love photobooths, so I was so disappointed to find out that their printer was out of ink/paper so we would only be able to email ourselves our photobooth pictures. But guess what? If you do the email option, you do not get a strip of photos... you get just ONE. We asked them how the printer could run out of ink and/or paper on a Saturday night because it seems logical that they would have stocked enough for the weekend, but the hostess said only that they ran out and she did not have any more. What makes the photobooth experience even worse is that the camera is horrible and unable to focus, so the two pictures that we took came out completely blurry.  We were finally seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time, at a half moon table facing the window so we had a view. The restaurant interior is very dark, which is good for ambience I suppose but horrible for pictures, at least on my cameraphone. Luckily my friend let me borrow her phone for pictures since her phone's camera does better in low lighting than mine.  Our group of six shared the following appetizers: -- EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA FRIES: with pomodoro & parmesan fonduta The fries were pretty soggy, but they tasted pretty good. The marinara sauce complimented them well. -- ORZO MEATBALLS: with parmesan pomodoro These were just okay. Nothing special. -- BACON WRAPPED DATES: with spicy Italian sausage & gorgonzola crema I love bacon and I love dates, so I thought this would be a pretty amazing appetizer. It was good, but not that good. -- LOBSTER ARANCINI: with calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli We all liked this one. I think this was RF's favourite appetizer. Pretty good! -- FRITTO MISTO: shrimp & calamari with shaved fennel & lemon aioli There was barely any shrimp in this appetizer. It was mostly calamari... normal calamari. The aioli was good but they gave very little of it. This dish is basically overpriced calamari.  While the appetizers were mostly just okay, we all loved the complimentary breads spread. Long thin crispy breadsticks, flat crunchy bread of some sort, along with freshly baked bread in a crockpot came out with lemon butter, fried capers, pink salt, basil oil, and red pepper flakes. That was really fancy and delicious! They definitely get points for that.  We then had the following pastas: -- RISOTTO: crab & scallops We ordered two of these. JQ had one and Crystal and I shared one. It was pretty good flavour-wise, but it was not as well cooked as I would like. I like my risotto really well cooked so that it is nice and soft... and this was not that. But it still tasted good overall. -- FARROTTO: creamy porcini mushrooms, brussels sprout leaves, pomegranate, pecorino tartufo RF got this one. The grains were larger than we expected. The mushrooms are the dominant flavour of this dish and I thought it was just okay. -- PAPPARDELLE: pork ragout, parmigiano reggiano We ordered two of these as well. KB had one and Crystal and I shared one. Following the theme of the night, this was cooked too al dente for me and I thought the flavour was just okay. Crystal likes her pasta al dente though so she enjoyed it. -- BUCATINI: calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta JP got this. Despite having chili as an ingredient it wasn't very spicy, as least according to her. She also found it to be cooked too al dente for her liking.  While none of the desserts called out to me, our group ended up getting two: -- HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE TART I did not try this one because of the hazelnut, but Crystal was the one who ordered it and she liked it. -- LEMON BUNDT CAKE Thank goodness this cake comes with creme fraiche, because it is dry! You definitely need to eat it with the creme, and it tastes pretty good when you do.  Overall I found the food here to be pretty mediocre. Add in the high prices and it goes from OK to MEH and becomes a place that I cannot recommend and will not return to. Sorry Giada!",

    "text": "After trying unsuccessfully to get dinner reservations anytime in the next few months.  I made plans to try Giada for lunch.  We arrived a little early and checked in with the hostess.  She said they were running behind on reservations.  The whole hostess area was crowded with people waiting so we decided to leave and walked around for a bit.  We were told they would call us when our table was ready.  We were a little worried about time.  My friend had to work later that day and I had seen reviews about being seated late and service and food being slow.  We decided to not wait for the call and just go back to the restaurant to wait.  To our surprise we were seated right at our reservation time.     I ordered the Birdie for my beverage, it is Giada's version of an Arnold Palmer, while it was good I wouldn't order it again.  Nothing special, esp for $9.  We started with the Chicken Marsala Meatballs and a Margherita Pizza.  For our entrees we had the Tuna Sandwich with Arugula  salad and Lobster Roll with Zucchini Scapecci.  Both sandwiches were excellent.  I think the Zucchini might be my favorite part of the meal.  I wasn't sure what to expect but it was delicious.  We finished the meal with Zeppoles, Assorted Cookie Platter, Mocha Mio and Cappugiro.  Everything was so light and refreshing we felt great after lunch.  Not tired or sluggish like you sometimes get after such a big meal.  I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner or their new breakfast.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review because I went there for the first time in December and then promptly raved about it for 2 months to anybody who would listen.  Had I written my Yelp review then, I would've given them 5 stars from the impeccable service, perfectly executed food, and beautiful ambiance.  My friend and I were seated in the main living room and still had a great view of the strip. We ordered the burrata and charred octopus dishes to start, and then I had the branzino while she had the crab and scallop risotto.  I ate every single bite. Our water glasses were never empty and the waitstaff was very attentive. The wine recommendations were spot on.  I left deciding it was new favorite restaurant in Vegas.  I waited to write my review though because my experience with new restaurants is that the consistency isn't always there.  I just went again this past weekend and was appalled at what a completely different experience we had.  In all fairness, I wouldn't say it was horrible and the food was still decent, but relative to the high bar that was set from my first time around, it was a drastic change.  I had no issues with paying $100 per person the first time.  As for the second time, I would've been happier at Maggianos.    First, the wood burning smell was incredibly stifling this time and since the initially tried to see us in the little back room with seemingly no ventilation, it was difficult to bear.  We moved tables, which helped marginally, but it wasn't until they opened the windows later into dinner that it was back to normal.  Second, our waitress was sporadically attentive, disappeared for long intervals, and told me things that I asked for before on my first trip (like plain grilled bread to eat with the burrata) didn't exist.  (When she checked with the kitchen though, it did materialize.) She also cleared our apps without asking if we were done because our entrees were ready.  Third, the food execution......the orzo meatballs were tasty and the burrata again delicious. I did a repeat of the branzino because I loved it so much the first time, but this time it lacked seasoning and was the skin was crispy in parts and soggy in others. My friend got the rack of lamb, which was a pretty tiny portion to begin with, which wouldn't have been an issue if 1/3 of it was big globs of fat.  We didn't even bother with dessert.    I have no issues with portions sizes and inflated prices on the strip because usually you get what you pay for from a reputable restaurant.  This was a major disappointment.  I may one day try it again, but it'll be for breakfast or lunch if anything.",

We were disappointed with the dessert, so at no charge, he brought us another one which we liked much better. But, I still think the dessert portion of the menu needs to be readdressed. Add a classic Tiramisu please! I would have given a 4 star, but Jason did such a good job, I gave a 5. The best food we had the entire week in Vegas. Nice ambience, casual cool. Great view of strip.

My salmon was good but not the best salmon ever and it was the most expensive salmon I have had. The side of corn with sausage was actually NOT impressive at all. The cocktails were impressive. Service impressive, view impressive, and beautiful lighting. I watch Giada show a ton and really wanted to eat here but dinner took 3.5 hours and the delay between courses was not appreciated at all. The Lemon souffle was the best thing we had!!! Truly amazing and I will crave it for years to come but everything else I can make better at home. I had the mozzarella tomato salad. It was colorful but not full of flavor!",

That being said, this is a high-end restaurant (yes, that means pricey) and I knew that going in. So I'm unhappy to report that the food is perfectly fine but hardly worth the price.  When you are paying high $20's for pasta, you want the dish to be spectacular.  It wasn't.  It was just fine.  As were the appetizers.  And try finding a bottle of wine that you want for under $60.  I certainly don't mind paying over $100 per person for a  great meal.  But that wasn't what I had here.",

    "text": "Well la de dah!. Last time we came to Las Vegas we couldn't get a dinner reservation, so we went for lunch. The food was very good, and the restaurant was very attractive, and modern. This timeI made a reservation 3 weeks in advance, and when asked for special request, I asked for a table by the windows. I was contacted a few days before, stating that the only way they could follow up with our request, was to guarantee that we would both spend over $100 each on food and drink. I stated that I wasn't sure on how much we were going to spend, so our table was in front of the bar. Loud, had to keep requesting to have water filled, and food service was not very good. I had better service, and food at \"Olives\" in the Balagio. Love Giada, I hope this is forwarded to someone who cares.",

Upon entry it smelled like a log cabin with a roaring fire (fine if I'm camping).  Hmmm.  And that smell permeated my outfit for the rest of the night...sadly we had just started ours (pre-theatre) so that was a bummer.  Dry cleaner..here I come. Sat down and noticed chips on the plates & glassware...and as the meal progressed, more chips.  Our entire meal was luke warm at best (not piping made to order hot as it should be), Calamari was charred and dry (big ick!), meatballs super tiny (should not be allowed to call them meatballs), Bugatoni lacked flavor and character and my husband's white lasagna over cooked. Our waiter was a nice kid, but not guest service oriented.  We clearly were not impressed.  Anyway, walked away smokey smelling and hungry.  Have written in to express my disappointment and hope to hear from the restaurant.  Not holding my breath.",

I know because I have had my share of lobster rolls. All ingredients were fresh, the decor was beautiful (great view) and the service was outstanding.

    "text": "This is my new favorite chef's tasting menu in Vegas!  They give you some of her recipes in a signed envelope when you do it. It's also not as expensive as most other places - $125 a person.   The ambience is so airy and beautiful. We sat by the windows which open! The service was some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. They were always on top of our drink orders, waters and courses and their knowledge of the menu and different foods was impressive.   They start you off with an assortment of breads, oil and seasonings. Here's what I loved most - the lemon spaghetti with shrimp (the shrimp were HUGE), the vegetable bolognese, the smashed potatoes and grilled broccoli rabe, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese stuffed peppers.   Here's what we also tried but I wasn't totally in love with - the third item on our antipasti platter (Giada's favorites). I can't remember what it was so it wasn't memorable. The salmon wasn't as great as I had hoped, the lamb was good but I didn't completely love it and the farroto was ok.  On to dessert - WOW! They bring a cart over and let you choose whatever you want and as much as you want. I had a chocolate torte with a scoop of banana gelato and a scoop of the coffee gelato at the waiters insistence. My husband had a cheesecake with strawberry gelato. The deserts have gold flakes on them!  One thing irritated me - there was a guy sitting at the table next to us with a baseball cap on. He was super annoying. Not Giada's fault at all but I couldn't believe he would eat in such a place without removing it.   This is one of my new favorite places in Vegas. We will be back next trip!",

    "text": "Disappointed from the first 10 seconds.  Why? Because that's how long it took for the hostess to acknowledge us standing in front of her.  We were on time for our party of 4 reservation, which was set 3 months ago.   My boyfriend and I went to dinner with another couple and we were looking forward to this dinner for months, as no one in our party had been there ( we all live in CA) before but had all heard great things about this restaurant.   She tells us they are readying our table and that we could wait in the bar.    We wait in the bar...5 minutes...10 minutes....15 minutes....20 minutes.  All the while, the main dining room that wasn't filled when we first arrived, was completely full.  People kept being seated while we were waiting our turn.  After patiently waiting 20 minutes, we go back to the hostess to see where we're at with our table.  Then she says that she'll have us seated right away.  Another hostess takes us into the main dining room and then leaves us in the middle of the floor while she goes to \"check something\".  She comes back and takes us to a BACK ROOM, with NO WINDOWS and only 4 small tables with even smaller chairs.  NOT the dining experience we were waiting out the 3 month reservation for!    We kindly ask to speak to the manager, who apologizes and offers to break up a larger table for our smaller party.  The table we are taken to is still OFF the main dining room, still behind a small wall with blinds in the windows blocking most of the Las Vegas view.  The food was above average, but in Vegas, there is no shortage of superior food.  I do not feel the need to ever come back here.  What irked me even more was that there wasn't any attempt at service recovery. Meaning, no effort was made at all to recover the situation other than moving us CLOSER to the main dining room.  Keep in mind, this reservation was set 3 months ago!    Dinner was good, but not mind blowing.  At the end of our meal, my boyfriend wanted a pastry off the pastry cart, but was told he couldn't have one because those were for the special Tasting Menu only.  THEY COULDN'T EVEN LET HIM HAVE A COOKIE FROM THE DAMN CART!  We were not offered comped dessert, drinks, or ANYTHING.  Not that we were looking for freebees, we spent close to $500 on this dinner.  But I just feel, that being in the food/service industry myself in the past, that MORE could have been done to make up for such a bad start.  I was left with a bad taste in my mouth for the majority of the experience.  This dinner was going to be our big splurge for our Vegas weekend with good friends and it was very quickly ruined.    The hostesses are the FACE of any establishment, they create that initial impression.   When they don't acknowledge your presence or at least make initial eye contact with you when you walk up, that sets a bad tone for the whole establishment.  The manager did not even return to our table to check up on us to see how we were doing.  I was dining at Sage at the Aria the night before and my boyfriend only had to look over his shoulder and someone QUICKLY approaches our table asking if he can be of any service to us.  THAT is PHENOMENAL and SUPERLATIVE service.    Other restaurants I have been to (in CA) would have a manager come to the table to see how we were enjoying our food. I mention that the steak I ordered, at the server's glowing recommendation, was overcooked and not at all how she described.  8 minutes later, we have another steak cooked to perfection and the manager returns AGAIN so see how we like this new steak AND she comps us a dessert.  She easily recovered the whole situation!  And we were left highly impressed by this restaurant and we continue to recommend it to our friends and family based on their phenomenal service.  GIADA'S COULDN'T EVEN DO THIS!  Not asking for much, only some simple consideration for our dining experience.    I'm returning to Vegas again in 3 weeks and again, my girlfriends and I have a reservation at Giada's.  BUT if this is what I can expect for my money, then I am taking our party SOMEPLACE ELSE.  SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!",

We had one app that was the roasted sweet peppers stuffed with goat cheese.  That was a pretty good starter.    Unfortunately they did not have their signature lunch dish, the Lobster Roll.  So we went for the muffaleta and the lemon grilled cheese sandwich.  The muffaleta has a great flavor, but the bread was too hard in my opinion.  Plus it was a tad small.  The grilled cheese was very tasty.  Plus we added prosciutto to it to make the sandwich more savory which was really nice.    The best dish we had was the dessert which was the tiramisu with lady fingers.  The flavors just exploded in our mouths and definitely elevated our lunch to another level.    Overall it was a nice lunch, but nothing special.  It was solid, but not spectacular.",

The food...wow.  We had the chicken Marsala meatballs, the romain salad, the linguine with pork ragu sauce, lemon smashed potatoes, and the stuffed veal.  The portion sizes are generous and practical for a high end restaurant.  The above meal was a bit too much for two people to split.  The meatballs were yummy.  Well balanced...the tomatoes added much flavor which was pleasantly unexpected.  The salad on its own was quite good.  Boldly flavored, and the flavors were completed with the croutons.  But using the included cheese \"breads\" added another level to the taste.  The pasta with pork ragu sauce...delicious.  Savory and boldly flavored...we wished the pasta was a bit firmer...but even that did not distract from the flavor.  The portion itself would be enough for a light eater.  The stuffed veal...was perfectly done.  Crispy, savory, with a bit of salt from the cheese and prosciutto.  It was nicely complemented by the pasta and the lemon potatoes we had ordered.  The iced tea was a very lightly flavored with peach...and perfectly complimented the entire meal.",

    "text": "So a group of us decided to try Giada's for a friends birthday celebration.  First of all, if you don't want to valet, it's a pain in the ass to get here. I won't get into our ordeal with trying to get reservations for a large group, that was another pain in itself. My most favorite part of the Giada experience was the bar; Flash Gordon was playing on the tube, the bar staff was friendly and informative, and they served an awesome drink called The Flash (Yes I'm a huge Flash Gordon fan).  The restaurant was beautiful. Our waiter was okay when we started the evening out but once he found out one of our table mates worked in a restaurant in Caesars, our side (not his side) of the table was almost ignored. The complimentary bread was great, loved everything in it.  For my meal I ordered the Spaghetti (with lemon and shrimp).  It was very average, the pasta was a bit over cooked. I expected it to be al dente, it wasn't. And the pasta was all stuck together with whatever they used to dress the pasta.  We also tried the Margherita Pizzette. That as well was very average and small. Another starter we sampled was the Bacon Wrapped Dates, they were okay, they were spicy as described, I have had better. My husband got the Filet. Another disappointment. The steak was done as ordered but it came with a clump of maitre d'hotel butter that was ice cold and did not melt.  They brought around a dessert cart after our meal, the waiter was unenthusiastic about his job. We asked him multiple times to repeat himself because he was so quiet. For dessert my husband got the Chocolate Zabiaone, it was just alright, not quite what we expected. I tried the Chocolate Chip cookie, Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookie. Both were good cookies.  We spent a lot of money for a very average experience.  I doubt I'd go back but if I did I'd get the Rib-Eye, we had a bite of a table mates and was pretty darn tasty. But good steak restaurants are all over Vegas, don't go here just for that!",

The staff was attentive and the ambience was decent enough. I was disappointed with serving sizes-we had 4-5 spoons of soup. (seriously). We both laughed our heads off after we left. We stopped at the food court in the hotel for dessert and it was so delicious ($15 for the two of us). I will not return. Might be awesome for a special occasion that you save up for so you can have a decent meal for 2 around $60 each person.",

We started with Veuve Clicquot Rose.  Later we had mixed drinks which were strong and good.    I recommend the Tasting Menu.   We tasted a little bit of many different dishes.   If you don't pace yourself, it is easy to fill up on appetizers long before the main courses arrive.  Everything from drinks to dessert was delicious.  Prices are expensive but Giada is a celebrity chef so this is expected.  I definitely will be back.  Our waiter and assistant waiters were very attentive and came around often.

They sat us at 9:30 and our waiter, Rocco, was prompt in serving us water and bread. They serve us with 3 different types of bread, all of them were fresh and flavorful especially the focaccia dipped in olive oil. We ate em all!   We both ordered the Tasting menu and Cabernet wine. There were three antipasti, crostini carpaccio and dates wrapped with bacon and red bell pepper with goat cheese. The first two were really good but I didn't care for the goat cheese. For the second course, I had the lemon spaghetti with fresh jumbo shrimp which was amazingly delicious and my wife got the veg bolognese which was very tasteful but not comparable to the spagetti. We end up splitting the spagetti and taking the bolognese home.  The third course, I had the Sicilian roasted lamb and my wife had the seared Salmon with succotash. Both came with smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy sausage. All were excellently done and beautifully served! with every course Rocco replaces our plates and silverware.  And finally the dessert cart! We get to pick 3 items each, but the waiter let us taste everything since it was late in the evening. My favorite was the choco truffles.  Overall, the food was amazing and the service was excellent! I would highly recommend Giada to everyone who visit LV. Just make sure you load up with cash since it's very pricey!",

However, relative to price, this was one of the worst meals I have had. Food was ok at best.  Our server Joseph was charming. Our 8pm reservation saw us waiting in the bar until 8.30pm with no communication or updates. We were only seated when we asked how much longer it would be. Salad starters arrived and chicken had been added to the wrong one. When this was pointed out, the salads were taken away and all but one piece of chicken moved to the other plate. They could at least have tried to cover their tracks and move every piece of chicken! No consideration for the fact that I could have been pescatarian and might not have wanted chicken on my plate. Main of pistachio salmon was fine but the arugula salad on the side was wilted from being under the lamp for too long. Lemon shrimp spaghetti was just not very good and shrimp were very firm and over cooked. Wine and spirits list was extremely uninspiring. They seemed short staffed. This is a restaurant pretending to be higher end than it is.",

I ordered a simple lasagna and I was expecting to get a nice, delicious meal but after waiting for 45 minutes what I got was a lasagna swimming in water or basically a badly unfrozen lasagna, I showed it to our waiter, he apologized and quickly took it away.  They asked me if I wanted something else instead but I didn't want to wait for another 45 minutes.  I shared small portion of my friend's meal that was semi decent and we asked for the check, surprisingly they didn't even deduct the lasagna from check, I didn't want to argue with them so we paid the bill and walked out with very bad experience.   I really wanted to love this place but sadly food quality is not as good as even Italian chain restaurants like Maggiano's or Buca di Beppo, what a shame.",

Please ($18.00 for a two egg plate with bacon and less than 3 oz of potatoes, and toast are you kidding me!!!! And No I didn't get any Golden Eggs with this!!!  Yes I am a worldly traveler and Vegas does have finer brunch options for more quantity & quality for the asking price!! The brunch dining was very slow and there were people sharing plates as I am sure they were also offended by the price points and what was being presented. Our server was very attentive & gracious but  did mention that other guest are unhappy with the price points and quantity & quality for pricing!   Giada does offer also $45 Brunch Buffet~~~~ That should be a joke, but it isnt. Please Giada & staff reevaluate your Brunch menu, as for what you get & pay for is ~~~ABSURD!

Not only was the menu fresh and vibrant, but it felt very farm to table which I am not sure is a thing in Vegas.  Little to no wait and we didnt have reservations until about 10 mins before we walked in. Service was very nice and timely. We really like the decor and the windows with the breeze and the view of the area. I would have loved to sit closer since the restaurant wasnt full.  We had fresh juice and lobster hash and I had salmon. We both had a grapefruit mint juice.   We loved it so much we came back the next day got brunch again! I got the same juice and a spread of meat and cheese. I am a grazer so this hit the spot.   I wish Giada was in Seattle so I could eat here all the time! We loved it.   p.s. the photo booth and art gallery walls were awesome too",

I had a pineapple/lemon/mint drink that was outstanding, some charcuterie, and the baked pasta as my main dish. We had some lemon ricotta cookies to top it off.   Portions are small, but the food was beautifully displayed and tasty. Not really my style but it was delish.   4 stars!",

It was our second time here for dinner, we had been here 2 years ago and wanted to return since we previously had a great dinner.  We began with the Blanco Cosmopolitan cocktail, it was a tart lemon and vodka concoction that was refreshing with a sweet cherry at the bottom of the tall glass.  Different breads were served with lemon butter, pesto olive oil, capers, salt and red chili flakes as we relished our cocktails.  We ordered the bruschetta - a totally different bruschetta with buratta cheese, avocado and balsamic strawberry vinaigrette.  Delightfully flavorful.  My dining champion also had the arugula salad, which she really enjoyed.  The sommelier stopped by our table as I examined the sizable wine list.  I said we were looking for a Pinot Noir to have with our pasta entrees.  He suggested a California bottle from Sonoma that was very good.  We then were served our pasta dishes.  I had the ravioli which were filled with lumps of lobster and served with a light lemon butter sauce.  I savored each bite of this dish!  I also had a side dish of artichokes - artichoke hearts roasted with lemon and topped with shaved Parmesan.  Also very good.   My sister-in-law had the rigatoni, the pasta had a vegetable bolognese that she said was rich and hearty.  She noted eggplant and mushrooms in the sauce.   For dessert we shared Giada's favorite cookies, the lemon was our favorite.  A delicious dinner with attentive service in a lovely setting.",

    "text": "Giada's is my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!! I have had every menu there (breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner). Breakfast is very simple. Lunch is FABULOUS!!! Please try the sandwiches and fried string zucchini! Happy hour- the burger is drool worthy. Dinner- please keep in mind this is the most expensive AND heartiest. We had the chef's menu which has multiple courses, and they are deceiving since they come out on small, white plates but will have you full by the end with no room left for dessert. I always order no matter what time of day, cookies to go! They are so soft and not overly sweet. Giada's is a MUST for any foodie in Vegas!!!   PLEASE NOTE!! Some reviews complain the pasta is doughy. It is FRESH, made in house!! Having been to Italy, real pasta is not tough. Giada's shows you how fresh their meals are the minute you walk in and see their pasta counter and fire brick oven for breads and pizza. No complaints here!",

First let me start with the ambiance, the restaurant is located in a boutique hotel which makes it all that more spectacular versus the large resorts. The service has been right on target. Our waiter was very Attentive but not overbearing. Very well versed in the menu. The Manager John was very welcoming and informative on the restaurant, Giada and the expectations of the staff to meet the clients needs. The food was spectacular we both had the crab and scallop risotto. Cooked to perfection and so filling! I highly recommend making this a top spot on your visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I have eaten here two times and it is definitely a restaurant that we will continue to visit during our annual Vegas vacation. I travel once a year with my mom and sister for a girls trip to Vegas and we love to try out new restaurants as well as return to some of our favorite spots. Growing up Italian and still visiting my relatives in Italy, I am very selective when it comes to Italian dining experiences. Giada's restaurant is such a warm and authentic experience and the food is absolutely delicious! Many of the dishes are very light and fresh using lemon, white wine, and herbs rather than heavy and thick sauces.  Our waiter's name was Rocco S. and he was absolutely the best! I'm sure everyone is great, but he made the experience extra special and he is from a nearby town of my family in Italy so it was comforting to hear him speak in Italian to us. If you are able, I would suggest requesting him!  Make sure to check-in on Yelp during your dining experience for a fun free treat! We had the option of choosing between a glass of Prosecco each or an assortment of cookies. We took the Prosecco and started the meal off right!   The cheese board is seriously delicious and so are the homemade honey and jams that accompany. We also ordered fritto misto to share before our entrees. This included fried shrimp and calamari -- the perfect appetizer!   I also ordered the lobster ravioli and I would highly recommend!  We also enjoyed drinks and dessert, but I would warn that the drinks are very strong (not a complaint, just a heads up :) )  There is also a pre fixe option for $120 per person, but the entire table has to select this option. This includes an autographed photo of Giada and access to the dessert cart. From my observations the dessert cart offered a few additional sweet treats that were not listed on the menu, but my suggestion would be to nix the pre fixe option and order multiple shared plates for the table. This way the experience is truly customized to your group and for the same price or less you can try a bunch of items in a very fun way!   At the end of the meal, or while you are waiting to be seated, make sure to take some selfies in the photo booth!   Overall, I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Honestly, the only thing that could have made the experience better would have been meeting Giada herself. Maybe next trip back!  I would also suggest making reservations ahead of time because the restaurant does get very busy. Make sure to request a window seat to enjoy a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain!   Happy eating!

    "text": "Being a fan of Giada's cooking shows on the Food Network, when I knew I was coming to Vegas I immediately booked a dinner reservation at her restaurant at the boutique hotel Crownwell about a month in advance.  We went there on the Halloween night and it was surprisingly quiet that night. My girlfriend and I were probably the most dressed up there and the patrons were definitely not the 20 to early 30 something partying crowds.  After looking at the prices on the menu I understood why, but what do you expect from a more refined, celebrity chef restaurant at a hotel in Vegas?  I enjoy Giada's style of cooking; Italian with her southern California twist; elegant, rich, flavorful yet not too heavy. The small bites (appetizers) menu is extensive: you might get full and not need the main course if you pick a few dishes. We only had the chicken marsala meatballs and roasted eggplant parmigiana with smoked scamorza cheese; both of which  were delicious. The eggplant dish tasted like a vegetarian lasagna dish.  We also had the scallop and crab risotto dish and the lobster ravioli, both were delicious but the portions were very small.   I wish I was hungry enough to try some of their meat or fish dishes, which by the way were a little pricey.   For dessert we only had room for a tiny cake, which was a special for that night and I can't remember the exact name but it contained some nuts like almond or hazelnut. It was good but a little too sweet to my taste. Maybe we should have tried their chocolate tiramisu instead?  The service was very good and prompt. The ambiance was modern and nice. Good place for a nice or romantic dinner night if you don't mind shelling out a little more from your wallet and not looking for cheap eats.",

The grilled cheese came with some fried veggies with a garlic aioli and all of the flavors just worked so well together. The polenta added a cut of a crunch to the waffles, and the pineapples were grilled to perfection. The maple syrup and Nutella paired quite nicely.   Located in the Cromwell, Giada designed this restaurant to feel like you're a guest at her home. It's elegant and simple. Soft music, big windows with lots of natural light and pretty views.   We arrived a few minutes before 2, and the hostess said we missed lunch but could order from a bar menu and only the lounge/bear seating was available. So while we waited, I searched for a menu and saw that lunch was actually until 2:30. The bartender was nice enough to let us order, but the situation was a bit of a disappointment.   While we were there, Giada was also visiting, so it was cool to see her. Apparently she comes once a month, and seemed to know and interact well with a lot of the staff members. She changes up the menu pretty often and gets quite creative from what I've heard.   By the host stand there's a free phot booth! Be sure to stop in for a picture.",

Prince Edward mussels were fantastic, cooked well, and balanced flavor.  Finocchiona was wonderful and well seasoned.  Ricotta Crostini with a drizzle of honey Burratta was amazing.   Seevice: 3.5 out of 5.  First we made a reservation for 8.15 and arrived at 8.16. Told hostess I was there. She said give us a few minutes. Finally seated at 8:45 after asking. No communication and she was stand offish.   Server: Out server seemed uninterested in us. He explained the menu and then took drink order and food order. We never saw him again until dessert.   Our backwaiter was amazing. He refilled our glasses, asked how everything was and made us feel very welcome.   We had to ask for a dessert menu and then our main server showed up to take the order. Overall I was annoyed by our server.   Drinks: 4 out of 5. So I ordered a Grey Goose and tonic and my husband ordered a Cosmo. His cosmo was 19$. I know we are in Vegas but good god. We have been other places in the strip and the prices were not this high for drinks.   Overall it was good but with a few tweaks could be amazing.",

We had the Chicken Marsala meatballs, they were ok nothing special.  I ordered the risotto which was crunchy and undercooked.  My friend had the shrimp scampi fettuccine and it was just ok.

This actually made dining more enjoyable  The martini was expertly prepared by my attentive and knowledgeable bartender Katie, and she had great suggestions on the menu items that I might be interested in sampling. Her advice was well appreciated and was spot on. I had the arugula salad and the bucatini and could not have been more pleased with my choices. The salad was just the right amount of spicy and acidic to entice the appetite and the pasta was firm enough to support the sauce but tender enough to be supple in the mouth. Both great! You can't go wrong with the food or the service at Giada.",

    "text": "I wasn't impressed by the food, but my friend left a happy camper because this is one of her favorite restaurants in Vegas! Giada is very easy to locate as there are multiple signs pointing you into the right direction throughout the Cromwell. Bummer that the photo booth was not working this time around. It is located in the lounge/waiting area. You will not miss it because it says \"Photobooth\" in large print against the wall. So make sure you reserve some time to take pics before or after your meal to capture the memories.  The space in the restaurant was plentiful and open. High ceilings and tall windows adorned the restaurant. Giada is located on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd so you can get a great panoramic view of the strip. Everything was very clean and fancy; I didn't expect anything less from a $$$ restaurant.   We ordered the Dolce Vita and freshly squeezed orange and carrot juice as our beverages. The Dolce Vita was sweet and flavorful. I opted for the orange and carrot juice which wasn't as flavorful or sweet, but was an excellent healthy alternative.  My friend ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with a side of zucchini fries. The grilled cheese is one of their most highly requested dishes, but it wasn't memorable for me. The pesto cheese oozed out of the panini so if you're a huge fan of grilled cheese sandwiches, you should give this one a try.  I ordered the giada burger with a side of cacciatore chips. The chips were flavorful and crunchy. The giada burger was very tasty but I wouldn't say it was worth the price. I felt like I could've gotten the same burger elsewhere for a fraction of the price.  I probably won't come here again for brunch, but would definitely give it another try for dinner.",

Both were delicious.  We ordered the pastry assortment tray and each pastry tasted amazing  and at a very reasonable price.    One of my daughters ordered the Strawberry Polenta waffle which was very crispy and the berries were very sweet . My mom and I ordered the Lobster hash which was a good size portion and very tasty. My other daughter ordered the Caprese Frittata with Prosciutto which was very delicately flavored with fresh basil.  Our service was excellent.. attentive but very leisurely.

So instead, they let us reserve 2 separate tables.   When we were seated, our tables were nowhere near each other. In fact, they were pretty much on opposite ends of the restaurant. On the upside, our server was extremely professional and very helpful! :) they were good at refilling our drinks and answering any questions we had on the menu.   I ordered a seared tenderloin crostini as an appetizer and the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. The crostini was decent and the spaghetti was okay. I did not enjoy the sauce, the portion was super small for the price ($34), and the shrimp was so overcooked! I was so disappointed.   Overall, overpriced and overrated. It is very fancy and professional, but I don't recommend at all, spend your money elsewhere, like a buffet. You'll get more bang for your buck. They also charged us for gratuity, which was okay with me, but they did not tell us. In fact, they gave us the option to tip more, so be careful when you tip! Make sure they didn't charge you already.",

Had the carbonara pizza with a sunny side egg on top and the lobster hash.  Other were good for the first few bites. Halfway through they seemed to start lacking flavour or were missing something. Also ordered the assorted bread/pastry board. Had 4 items all sweet. A muffin, a danish, a scone and a chocolate croissant kind of sweet for before brunch but great for after a meal. Only thing I didn't like was the danish ( only cause it was filled with a lemon creAm and I'm not a fan of lemon flavoured sweets). Overall good ambiance but not sure I would go back for the food. Wasn't bad just wasn't great.",

We started off with the crostini which is an absolute must. That burrata and honey, oh my it is good!! We also ordered the bacon wrapped dates which the men at the table loved!  We then moved on to the main course. I had the cheese ravioli which was so incredible and really melts in your mouth. We also ordered the lobster and crab tortellini and risotto which I heard were also great dishes.   As it was my birthday, they brought out a lovely plate of lemon cookies and another delicious chocolate dessert. You MUST get the lemon cookies here, they're amazing!

    "text": "I'd been daydreaming about dining at Giada since their doors first opened 2 years ago. She's one of my favorite celebrity chefs because of her take on Italian dishes with a healthy and fresh Southern California twist.  We made our reservations via Open Table which was a completely painless process. I originally had us set to go for brunch (when the prices are a little cheaper) but knew I couldn't possibly go home without trying a pasta dish, so dinner it was. Plus it would give us the option to try dessert as well. I've had my eye on the cookies, especially her signature lemon ricotta ones.    The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning. Gorgeous light fixtures, chic decor, and floor to ceiling retractable windows with spectacular views of the both the Paris and Bellagio fountains.   Because we were there in the evening, it was candlelit too making it very romantic. I would have loved a window seat but we still had a nice view from our table.   Our server was knowledgeable and had great recommendations for us first timers. I really liked the idea of her tasting menu, but at $140 a person we couldn't justify it. Had it been a special occasion maybe, but not for an everyday dinner.   We started with cocktails ($15 each) which were both great. Mine was the La Strada and had Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, and Proseco. Tart, a teensy bit sweet, and refreshing. I don't remember which one my husband ordered, but I believe it had orange bitters and egg whites in it.   The complimentary bread plate is interesting and we enjoyed the different flavor and texture combinations. You get thin breadsticks, crunchy Parmesan chips, and a small loaf of an olive oil bread with rosemary. Alongside is finishing salt, red pepper flakes, capers, pesto, and the most phenomenal lemon mascarpone butter in the world. You must try it! We couldn't get enough.   We wanted an appetizer so we agreed on the fried artichoke with orange hummus. We weren't expecting to see a whole artichoke come out. We figured it would be individual breaded and fried bits. It was messy and annoying to eat, but at least the flavors were there.   For my entree I chose the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. Our server warned us about the small portion sizes because the pasta dishes are not meant to be a main course. It actually ended up being a perfect amount, though I don't feel was worth the hefty price of $34. The shrimp were fishy and over cooked resulting in an unpleasant chewy bite. The lemon pasta however was perfection.   My husband ordered the spicy sausage pizzette and it was comically small. He said the flavors were okay but nothing to write home about.  We decided to skip dessert to avoid any further disappointment, and as soon as we asked for the check our once attentive server went awol. We sat with empty drinks and cleared plates for nearly 20 minutes until he arrived back with it. It ended our meal on a more sour note than I had hoped.   Overall, as long as you realize that what you are paying for is mostly the experience then you won't be let down. Should we make a return visit, I wouldn't mind opting for brunch next time.   They even take a photo of you downstairs before the meal, and try to get you to pay for a souviner copy on the way out. It all seemed gimmicky to me, but I suppose that's merely Vegas.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to trying breakfast/brunch here, but I was let down drastically. Ok I am going to talk about every aspect about the restaurant, let's start with the waiting area it has a faux leather tan couch that is soooo dirty and beat up and probably has not been replaced in the three years this restaurant has been open. Now let's move into the indoor decor...plates, napkins, doilies has her name on everything. The view is nice it overlooks the Bellagio water fountain and the windows were opened in 98 degree weather a lot of us asked to be moved because of the heat and they finally closed the windows when enough of the patrons complained. Our waitress Becka, I believe, was really nice though it's not her fault the food ...  Ok food, if you look at our profile we are foodies and eat at upscale restaurants all the time...with that said how can you go to an Italian restaurant and mess up meatballs, we had the chicken meatballs, it was either that or the orzo so we had the chicken and it has no seasoning and just did not taste like anything. The cutting board or charturie platter was good but it was $24 and then they ask do you want bread????? Uhmmmmm you normally eat the meats and cheeses with crackers, crostinis or bread well no....that was an additional $6.   Ok so I ordered the gnocchi... disgusting. It was chewy instead of fluffy they don't use potato they use flour and the sauce tasted like Ragu nothing special and the portion was small and gnocchi is the cheapest thing to make so you would think it would be a big plate. My partner ordered the frittata and he said it didn't taste like anything again and had to ask for pepper and salt when you go to gourmet restaurant like this if you ask for pepper or salt it means to chef they are not doing their job. But I tasted his plate and it was just not edible. $100 later for a breakfast/lunch We left hungry and disappointed. And to top it all off there was another frame of Giada every corner like her ego isn't big enough. Also being local this is the first time I go to a celebrity chef restaurant that has a freaking gift store Giada shirt, sweater, cook book, etc. I will unfortunately never come here again.",

Not the best steak by far, Ruth Chris steak is way better, out of 6 people only 4 ordered a drink and only one drink each. Would not recommend this restaurant unless you want to go for the atmosphere and an appetizer before heading to a good restaurant for dinner.",

When we first walked in you picked up a very classy vibe which I liked a lot since a lot of time in \"Sin City\" you feel a little gross so it was quite refreshing.   The staff was very nice and accommodating and the tables and chairs were comfortable. The restaurant as a whole was very high end. Everything from the placemats to the mugs was personalized with the logo. A lot of thought was put into it and it was successful I thought.  Now I will go onto the food. It was very good. Nothing to jump around and dance about, but it was solid Giada food. Just what you would expect from the famous food network star. I got the Margherita pizza and I loved it. I also got a cappuccino which was very good, but, let's be real, how can one go wrong with a cappuccino? For desert we got these yummy fruit infused donuts with a chocolate dipping sauce and they were to die for.   The only complaint I have about the place was that they had this big beautiful windows open which would be lovely anywhere else except the smoky, busy streets of the Vegas strip. You would get random whiffs of cigarette smoke which really ruins your palette while trying to eat and enjoy food with new and exciting flavors. Also a really loud motor cycle or type of car would speed by and It was very startling. I dropped my fork at one point because of how creeped out I was.   Everyone at the table was content with our meal at Giada :)",

Items selected:  - Lobster Arancini w/ calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli $18 - Pea Pesto Crostini, prosciutto san daniele $14 - Artichoke Soup w/ mint, tomato & focaccia croutons $11 - Tricolore gorgonzola, dates, walnuts & prosciutto $16 - Spaghetti w/ shrimp, lemon & basil $28 - Tortellini w/ pea pesto, pancetta & mint $26 - 7oz Filet w/ salsa verde & crispy polenta $42 - Trio of Tiramisu - peanut butter & jelly, chocolate, and blackberry lime $8  We realized that it's going to be too much for two, but really wanted to sample a little bit of everything and take home the rest in a box.  In a word, Giada's taste should be described as \"light\".  Or \"lemon\", as most of items above had some sort of citrus flavor. Even from the lobster arancini and pea pesto crostini, we sensed fresh aroma of lemon, and it was amazing.  The contrast between the homemade spaghetti (light) and tortellini (rich) convinced us the versatileness of pasta dishes. No simplistic marinara / alfredo are provisioned here at Giada, which is what exactly we'd expected.  And the Tricolore salad with gorgonzola, dates, walnuts and prosciutto... perfect balance of bitterness, sweetness and crunchiness.  By the time we get to the dessert we were completely full, but were unable to resist Tiramisu per the waiter's recommendation - glad we ordered!  It's a great idea for Las Vegas to have a fantastic restaurant like Giada at the most prestigious intersection on the strip - what can I say? Life is good!",

Much to some people in our party's joy, Giada is on site (Monday night at 9:00 pm) Our server, Frederick, is amazing... he explained the menu and gave excellent recommendations.  We also get a stop - off from  the GM who wants to make sure everything was going well. and not 5 minutes later, Giada strolls in, making JG go crazy. We ask our wait staff if we can meet her, and Giada walks over, saving my arm from an eminent bruising from getting hit by my friend and her repeating \"Giada's HERE!!!! Giada's HERE!!!!\" After the chef siting and picture taking we were treated to Giada's best and a very pleasing appetizer round. This meal is in rounds... A marathon, not a sprint, so pace yourself if you want the full experience.   We had one each from all the appetizers from each category, and for dinner had the porterhouse for two, spaghetti, tortellini. Margaretta pizza, calamari, meatballs, prosciutto, and bruschetta and mushrooms were all wonderful. All offerings were perfectly prepared, tortellini was perfect sauce, not too too.. just right and porterhouse was seasoned just right.  If you make it to Vegas, stop by Giada's and have one of the best meals you will ever have in Vegas! That's amore!!!!",

I order my favorite appetizer, the octopus, and it was tender with a nice smokey flavor. The yellow tomato soup had nice flavor.  Now for the entrees and some small plate pastas. Seafood risotto was a little bland and a little watery. The salmon and Branzino were perfect. The lobster didn't come with drawn butter until we asked, bucatini good, and the spaghetti lemon shrimp, a signature dish was gooey.  The big change for me was the atmosphere. The music is now so loud we had trouble talking at our table. The Cromwell seems to have become much younger and the restaurant seems to be trying to follow.  A side note, we left something at the restaurant  and found it impossible to talk to anyone there. The hotel nor the reservation service were able to connect us with anyone.",

    "text": "This is a \"Dance 10, Looks 3\" review.  Food was, admittedly, wonderful. Setting, gorgeous. Most of what you heard is True.   The bad: Don't expect the servers to listen and actually know anything about their food.   This might not be an issue, but if you have allergies, BEWARE!    Lovely thing about smartphones - you can see the menu even after they remove the real thing. We both ordered the brunch tasting menu, and noticed that several items had hazelnuts and almonds.  Admittedly, mine (hazelnuts) aren't generally life-threatening, but almonds trigger my husband's asthma. Not pretty in any case. I specifically asked our server if a particular menu item contained hazelnuts, or almonds, as WE ARE ALLERGIC to these items. We were reassured that they weren't in the items we had selected.  She must have a short memory. We were not give the opportunity to select our pastries, and out comes a lovely plate with five breakfast pastries. Two were beautiful chocolate mini cupcake looking items. I didn't think about it at first, because we had pointed out our allergies. Two of the five were hazelnut chocolate muffins. HELLO? Also on the plate were the rosemary berry scone (texture indicates more than just plain flour and butter as noted in the online recipe) and what I believe was the gluten-free blueberry muffin. If there is no wheat in the muffin, was it almond meal? I don't know, and I don't think the servers cared.  The busboy seemed to be new, too, and in boxing our leftovers, may have been neat in his placement of the items in the fancy plastic takeout boxes, but we won't ever know. He then put them on edge (not flat) in the smaller Giada bag, because \"sorry, we're out of the larger bags.\" Luckily, the fancy boxes did not leak!  I was really disappointed in the level of training, given the great attention to the details in all other aspects of the restaurant. The food, the \"G\" elements EVERYWHERE, and of course, the high end price tag. It was amazing how much attention the half-shaven, tattooed hipsters with their Giada-esque ladies got, at the table in the middle of the room, while it took half the meal for me to get a single cup of coffee. Dad is 92 and on a rolling walker, but he certainly couldn't understand what the hoopla is about this place, and I can't blame him.   Be ready to fight for your rights, or your allergies. They might just kill you with their attention to detail.",

From the moment you walk up the second floor to when we walked and were explained about each different prep stations I was quite impressed.The design is very cute and clean and I think it represents Giada to the tee. We came on their 6th day of opening the service was EXCELLENT. Our server Radoslav was really attentive and good at explaining the menu though it was quite lengthly. He explained that the portions are designed to be small so that you can try many things on the menu. My boyfriend and I had to beg to differ. We ordered 2 plates too many but they were all tasty. I did not know what to really expect but I was PLEASANTLY surprised. Here is what we ordered:  Drinks: La Strada: Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, berognoli limoncello, prosecco         very good, pretty and on the fruity side Riso Amaro: cucumber, celery bitters, 2nite vodka, fresh grapefruit and lemon          pretty, fruity but on the too much of the bitter side for me  Appetizers: Bacon Dates: very tasty, just the right amount of crisp on the bacon Octopus: lacking a little salt, the only dish i wouldn't order again Arugula Salad: simple but yet very refreshing  Entre: Tortellini: if you don't like peas you probably wont like this dish but i thought it was very good Spaghetti: PERFECTION. BY FAR MY FAVORITE DISH. spaghetti and all pasta dishes are made in house. this dish was so refreshing and was just perfect with the large shirmps. I WANT MORE!!! Filet: cut of meat was very good and cooked to perfection Side Corn: with a kick of spicyness and charr.   We had no room for desert but did have the Espresso Nocciol and Lemoncello Berta for a drink after our meal.   The Espresso Nocciol was velvet in my mouth. SOOO good. it has nutella in it. Need i say more??   The Lemoncello was a nice palate cleanser  Overall I would HIGHLY recommend that you try Giada. If you call and try to make reservations you might not be able to get the reservation but if you walk in and have a small party i'm sure they can accommodate you. Rumor is that they are \"fully committed\" until October.  I almost forgot the VIEW!!!!! Giada in located in the new Cromwell Hotel. She totally lucked out the the view. because its just beautiful up there with the view of the strip.   Good lLuck and Good Eats.",

My husband had the tenderloin sliders which he claims is one of the best, came with fried zucchini crisps. I had the margarita pizza flatbread which was HORRIBLE and that's why 3 stars. First of all it came so cold, I had to send it back. Even after that it was barely warm. The tomatoes on it were so sour and mozzarella cheese was not even melted. Dough had no salt no seasoning. We had tiramisu for desert which was perfect, not to sweet and light. Portions are small but it was just right for us. I had heard about their famous bread which I learnt they stopped serving for lunch :(  I hope dinner is a better experience.",

The tenderloin was delicious as well and I loved the smashed potatoes. The corn was a little spicey  for my taste. The gelatos except the banana were delicious and I love the chocolate ganache bar and the lemon cheesecake as our table got a variety of desserts we were able to try a bunch of items",

There are a ton of reviews so I'll just focus on what I haven't seen mentioned. We got the cacio e pepe for two in the small cheese wheel. First off, this can definitely serve more than two if you're eating anything else with it. We ended up taking about half home. I do think the cheese wheel is a bit of a gimmick, but the good thing is they do give you the cheese wheel to take home if you have leftover pasta. So even if you don't I'm assuming you could take it. There was still a lot of parmesan left so we've been enjoying pasta dishes out of it at home. As far as the quality of the cacio e pepe, it wasn't the best one I've had. The bucatini wasn't al dente at all, and aside from that it tasted just okay, not amazing (I've had amazing cacio before). It's a nice restaurant but if you want cacio e pepe I'd suggest saving your money and getting it at Eataly. Service was a bit off as well, as we only got our bread moments before our main course.",

Definitely get a reservation ahead of time if you can. While we waited, there is even a little photobooth for you to take pictures in! It was super cute!  I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was so fantastic. He was super attentive and made my party feel like we were so taken care of which I totally appreciated! My whole party was impressed with his service.  We had the lemon potatoes which I would recommend if you're a potato lover like myself. I ordered the pappardelle which was pretty good, but I tried my friend's order of the lemon spaghetti and wish I had ordered that instead! I love the presentation of all the food as well. You can tell that Giada really put a lot of thought into presentation in the entire restaurant!  Can't wait until my next trip to Vegas because for sure I will be back!",

    "text": "One of the worst dining experiences of my life and by far the worst I have experienced in Las Vegas and if you look at my reviews you will see I spend a lot of time in Vegas. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, didn't get seated until close to 30 minutes after reservation time. The first time I dined at Giada  about a year and a half ago they screwed up my reservation as well(see previous review), must be a theme here at Giada. Once seated we didn't get greeted by our waiter for 10 minutes. Drink order took 10 to 15  minutes to arrive. Waiter disappeared again. Comes back and we want to order first round appetizers and he tells about a chefs tasting menu but he has to disappear again for 5 minutes plus to retrieve menu. At this point we have been seated over 30 minutes and still have not placed an appetizer order. We finally order a couple appetizers and waiter disappeared again. The appetizers took an hour, keep in mind we still have not ordered additional courses or our main courses yet. I finally wave down waiter and ask about our appetizers an he seemed surprised that appetizers had not come yet....well if you did your job and checked in on us once in a while you would know they have not come yet. Between being seated 30 minutes late and the hour wait for appetizers we decided to skip additional courses and go straight to main based on limited time. Main course took another 20 or so minutes. At one point we needed a straw for a drink and there was nobody around I attempted to wave the waiter down a few times but he didn't see me so I had to get up and walk across the restaurant to the bar and grab a straw myself.  My fillet was not cooked to temp I requested(not even close), I ordered medium and it was rare at best and was cold(cool) probably from sitting after it was cooked and plated. it was a poor quality piece of meat as well, it was tough, not sure how a rare piece of meat can be tough but it was. We arrived at 7:20, got seated at 8 and finished main course at 10:05ish, we decided to skip dessert because we didn't have another hour to waste.   This was a special occasion anniversary dinner, they removed an appetizer charge from our bill and brought us a couple free cookies but that was absolutely meaningless to me, it was not about saving $15, this was supposed to be a very special evening but it was ruined. It was not about getting a free appetizer I would have gladly paid double the price to have an enjoyable evening or get a redo on the night. Thanks for ruining what was supposed to be a special evening...  This is an honest review, my first experience at Giada a year and a half ago was decent but this time it was a disaster. I will never go back and will never recommend it to anyone. If you read my other reviews you will see I rarely leave 1 star reviews, this was a situation where I wish there was an option for 0 stars because Giada earned 0 stars last night. The waiter should not be in the service industry, he was terrible. The place has security cameras everywhere so I hope management reads this review and goes back and reviews the tapes from 10/20/16 between 7:20-10:05pm and they will see exactly what I described above.   Stay away from this place, you have been warned!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated a late Valentine's Dinner at Giada. We have been underwhelmed at some other celebrity locales, but Giada has obviously done her homework and has an absolute winner.  From the moment we sat down, were felt like VIP's. Radoslav was knowledgeable, helpful and absolutely attentive to our needs. We started with drinks - the Barberella for me and a El Note(?) for my wife. Both were refreshing and delicious (my wife ordered a second). The Rosemary bread was fantastic, and served with red pepper flakes, shaved salt and dried capers, as well as herb olive oil and lemon butter to compliment. Next came a trio of Bacon wrapped dates, rib eye crustini, and baby sweet peppers, stuffed with goat cheese and an olive tapenade. We both agreed that we could eat a small SUV filled with the dates, and my wife loved the crustini, while I favored the peppers (a little shaved salt really brought out the flavor).   Next came the entrees - she had the Red Wine Rissoto, while I went for the Veal Chop Saltimbocca (as an aside, I typically do not eat veal because how they are raised, so I save veal dishes for special occasions - first time in nearly 20 years), which was highly recommended by Radoslav. Both dishes were presented simply, without excess garnish. My wife loved the risotto, saying the red wine gave a distinct flavor and did not interfere with the creaminess of the dish. I'm not a big risotto fan, but I appreciated the flavor and texture. My chop was, to put it mildly, was huge. I knew the minute it was placed in front of me, that I would be taking most of it home. the chop was cooked to perfection - breaded and topped with a bit of Parmesan, and with a grilled lemon to drizzle. IT was flavorful and satisfying (and satiated my veal craving for another 20 years).  As my chop was off being boxed up, we were surprised by a gift - a sampling of more treats - Orzo meatballs, Chicken Marsala Meatballs, and Lobster Arancini. All three were exquisite, and we tried desperately to finish them all, but had to cry mercy.  We did decide to order the assorted cookies to take home - Salted Peanut Butter, Lemon Ricotta, and Chocolate Chip (they did not last, once we got home). Although all were good, the peanut butter were \"Slap your mama\" good.  And, as we were paying the bill, another surprise - A \"Happy Valentine's\" gift of more desserts. All were delicious, and ensured that we waddled out completely satisfied.  As for the price; because of the occasion, price was not a concern, as we figured a top tier restaurant would be pricey. Before the bill, we had decided that whatever the price, we were very satisfied and believed we got more than our money's worth. Some people get upset at high prices, especially when the food doesn't live up to it. We got our bill and realized that we have paid much more at other \"celebrity\" restaurants for food that was not nearly as good as we had just enjoyed. This is not a \"dinner every Friday,\" place, but for special occasions (and we will be inventing a few - first day of Spring, Smarch, that day after some Tuesday), this will be our go-to place, as well as when guests come into town.  Thank you Giada, Radoslav, Chef Colleen, and everyone, for a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "We started with a couple of cocktails while waiting for our table to be ready, and I'm glad we did - they were very good, though a bit on the strong side. We chose the Serpico and the Giada Cocktail.  For dinner we we started with the orzo meatballs and the bacon wrapped dates, both were very good. The latter was a bit spicy. Great if you're like me and enjoy spice, but it could catch you off guard if you're uses to more mild flavors with bacon wrapped dates.  For our main courses we has the lobster, white asparagus tips and tarragon ravioli, and the veggie rigatoni. Excellent dishes.  We skipped dessert, but did get a couple of orange mocha mio's after dinner, and they were amazing! Easily one of the best coffee drinks I've ever had. It consisted of Lavazza Gran Riserva, steamed milk, chocolate ganache, and house-made orange syrup. I think I'll be dreaming about this drink tonight. ;)  UPDATED 12/13/15 - Came back again the same trip, this time for brunch. The chia seed parfait is amazing!! And of course I had another orange mocha mio. :)",

For some reason I thought it would be warm, but the bread was toasted and the sprouts were more like a slaw. The mix of sprouts, cheese and sweetness of cranberries was fantastic. I ordered the Giada....and posted a pic. Very chic and the type of eloquent touches I appreciate when ordering a cocktail. The bartenders were very attentive and energetic. I loved sitting at the bar! Now,behind the bar was the sexy table seating. The large posterior windows were the perfect frame to the intersection at Flamingo. The grand bridges were the focal point but the Belaggio water works were the backdrop.  I would come here again for a special ocassion.",

A dish \" shard\" stuck in her foot and caused minor bleeding when she pulled it out. After all the chaos their waiter asked if they were ready to pay their bill. The hostess did come over to see if she was ok. My son had to ask if he would be compensated for the injury/ embarrassment / ruined evening etc. She did cover the meal upon my son's suggestion. Mind you not one word/ gesture/ or apology from the manager. He/she never came to see what the chaos was or find out if my daughter in law wAs ok. So be careful if you dare go to Giada's.",

    "text": "I have to say that I was extremely excited to visit Giada's even with such mixed reviews and unfortunately it turned out to be very disappointing. From the beginning, the hostess kept ignoring us while we were in the waiting area as we stated we were ready to be seated and there was no genuine response or interaction. Once we got seated, our waiter happened to be walking by and elbowed my brother in the head. Instead of a sincere apology, he made a joke as if we welcome you with an elbow to the head. Really not appropriate for a venue such as this! The uniforms were sloppy, wrinkled and surprisingly messy on the waiters. Our waiter wasn't really friendly and seemed more annoyed that we didn't want to do the tasting or dine they way that they suggested. The food portions were very small relative to the prices and some of the dishes were bland. Others were very spicy and lemony! And when we gave feedback, our waiter said, well Giada does like her lemons! Really??? My sisters appetizer dish was removed and they took her fork but didn't get her a new one to eat her meal with. We had to ask a busser for one finally after waiting to get our server's attention. He was too busy counting his cash tips with another waiter besides him doing the same thing in front of all the tables seated by the stairs. This is classic bad behavior in the service industry and really should be addressed by management! Needless to say, there are many other restaurants that have amazing food and higher quality service that I would prefer to patronize over returning to Giadas!",

Starting with their drink menu, there was no shortage of whiskey love, which sings to my soul. From there, the bread/cheese plate was a perfect start followed by the Oysters Rockefeller. Easily the best Oysters Rock I have had- super moist and juicy! The Scallop and Crab Risotto was my main meal and it was seriously perfect. As full as I was, it's not a birthday celebration without something sweet so Giada's cookies were the best fit! The lemon ricotta cookie can keep any sweet tooth happy for hours!!!!",

Being locals we try to avoid the strip as often as possible, but Giada is one of the exceptions!!! We frequent Giada about 10 times a year with so many great choices here in Vegas. We love it because the service is always a 10 and you can taste the carefully thought components of each dish.   -The brunch menu is small but mighty. The hunters waffle & breakfast constantina are favorites. We also always order a pastry basket. Brunch is probably our favorite meal at Giada.   - Eating a casual dinner at the bar is fantastic.   - I will chose the tasting menu if it is a holiday tasting menu.   Our must get dinner items are: parm cheese w/honey, Ribeye, lemon spaghetti, & branzino. The sides change seasonally but my favorite side is a fall side with spicy sausage and corn. The bread 'basket' is awesome. Make sure along with salt, pepper, and butter they give you the fried capers (they normally do but just in case as they haven't a couple times w/o asking). I am one for trying new things but I get so hooked on my favorites that it's hard to try something new.  TIP the pastas are a course and not entree sized and can surprise some as I read prior reviews.",

But Giada Vegas rose above almost all the celebrity-run restaurant pitfalls with excellent food, wonderfully prepared cocktails, a warm welcome from the hostess, and an elegant aesthetic. Dining at Giada Vegas was an overall positive experience that would have us return. Speaking only for my meal, it was a delight from start to finish. I had a great pour on my Blanton's on the rocks. The salumi y formaggio was plentiful and filled with tasty cheeses, cured meats, and fig paste. Our table shared the bruschetta, chicken Marsala meatballs, mushroom arancini, and the olive sampler. All were delicious and not too plentiful, leaving us ready for our entrees. For my entree I had the creamy and tasty crab and scallop risotto. Presentation and flavor were both beautiful. Dessert was a decaf cappuccino and the fresh fruit tart--terrifically delicious. In all Giada Vegas earns high marks. I'd recommend it--do make reservations--as well as dine there again.",

    "text": "OMG- the restaurant is beautiful! Just the entrance itself feels grand and the inside is spacious, chic, and modern. Every last detail is fancy and luxe (down to the personalized toilet paper in the bathrooms!) and there's wraparound views of the strip. Now this is a Vegas restaurant. Great job Giada! I didn't expect anything less.   The food is delicious, but be warned, the portion sizes are small. Just look at Giada. You don't look like that by eating much. There's even a quote from her written all around the restaurant, \"eat a little of everything, but don't eat a lot of anything\". If you need more food, do what my sister and I did and share a few plates.   The meal starts off with a complimentary bread plate. So.Freaking.Cute. Like I said, every single detail of this place is impeccable. The bread comes on a wooden board with several little serving dishes of lemon butter, capers, salt, and the most delicious olive oil and vinegar. The bread is a little ramekin of focaccia (my fave!), breadsticks, and Parmesan crisps. The entire spread really only feeds 2 and you get 1 per every 4 people, but like I said the servings are small. You can be like us and ask for more. By the way, I know I just dedicated an entire paragraph to the bread, but it's so good, it more than deserves it.   As far as the food, there were some really delicious dishes and others that left much to be desired. Standout favorites include: rigatoni with veggie bolognese, surf and turf, salmon, and artichoke arancini.   Things we suggest skipping: Brussel sprout crostini and lemon souffle.   Service was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly.   Overall, if you're a Giada fan or not, this is great dining. (Disclaimer: I'm a huge Giada fan so my review may or may not be a bit biased. It was probably 3.5 stars, but yelp doesn't let you do half stars so 4 it is!)",

    "text": "I had REALLY high hopes for Giada but it just doesn't compare to other celebrity chef and top calibre dining options. The restaurant itself is picture perfect inside the stylish new Cromwell. The dining room is washed in white and curves out towards Las Vegas Boulevard with windows that open up so you can watch the Bellagio fountains - if you're seated in the right direction. We went on my birthday which was a Tuesday and I was SO excited. As we ascended the escalator we were greeted by the hostess who quickly dampened my excitement. We had reservations but still had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar which was probably good because the bartenders were actually the friendliest people in the entire restaurant.  Almost as soon as we sat down in this gorgeous, not cheap, restaurant, our extraordinarily unfriendly server tried to upsell us on some tacky package that came with an autographed picture of Giada. I've eaten at a number of \"celebrity chef\" restaurants and have never experienced a similar upsell. It felt very tacky and kind of ruined the vibe of the nice restaurant. This isn't Disneyland, this is a fine dining restaurant!   In addition to cocktails, we started with the Charred Octopus and it was delicious. It wasn't too scrawny and was very flavorful - I would highly recommend it. For my main entree I got the Risotto. The risotto came with two scallops and had two asparagus spears woven through it. The dish itself was delicious but at $35, a bit pricey for the portion. We also had some unmemorable sides. I do remember the bread basket being pretty top notch, though. Our waiter was rarely seen and when he was, he wasn't particularly pleasant.   As I mentioned before, it was my birthday and while I'm not a huge birthday person and definitely hate people singing to me in public, I found it very odd that no one even so much as mentioned it when we'd indicated that it was a birthday celebration in our reservation. In my experience most fine dining restaurants would at least say something... I don't know, maybe it was an off night but I doubt we will be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Last night was my second time at Giada and like the first time, it didn't disappoint.  I made a reservation well over a week ago to take a friend to dinner for her birthday.  Reservation was made through Open Table and was quick and efficient.  I requested a window seat via Open Table and of course was told nothing was guaranteed but a request would be submitted.    I was called about 3 days prior to our reservation to confirm and was told (rather bluntly but I get it - money talks) that a window seat is only guaranteed to guests who \"commit to spending $100 per person.\"  I thought that was a bit strange but told the restaurant rep that I couldn't commit to that (I couldn't eat $100 worth of food anywhere and I don't drink so getting to that figure wasn't feasible for me) and she politely said that she understood but would put in the request and do their best to accommodate me.  That's all I could ask and while it was a little strange to have been told that, in some weird way I appreciated the honesty.    Forward to last night.  We arrived on time and were seated right away at...wait for it...a window seat!  The caveat was that it was a window seat on the south side of the restaurant where they have these rather large and cumbersome wooden blinds that don't offer the best view but if we craned our necks just so...we'd get a partial view of the Bellagio fountains.  Suggestion: If a window seat is your thing, get specific and ask for a seat on the west side of the restaurant.  It's a less obstructed view (although I'm not certain you'd be able to see the fountains) but there are no wooden blinds at all on that side so the view is far better.   For dinner, we decided on a couple apps and then a couple pastas and we shared everything.  We started with the arugula salad with candied lemons, pancetta and shaved parmesan.  No kidding - I could have stopped there and been completely content.  It was so good.  Light but satisfying.  We then shared the crab and artichoke dip.  I was worried at first that it was going to be too heavy but in True Italian form, it was light but packed with flavor and incredibly delicious.  The lemon and spiciness of it made for a completely different taste than what you normally think of as a crab and artichoke dip and the herb crostini, while slightly over-greasy, paired perfectly with it.    We HAD to go with pasta for our main entrees and one out of two was amazing.  We settled on the risotto with king crab and scallops and the white lasagna.  The risotto was seriously out of this world.  It was so flavorful but again not heavy at all.  The scallops were grilled to perfection.  Absolute and total perfection.  We were a little less impressed with the white lasagna.  It just seemed like it was lacking something.  It was bland and not anywhere near as flavorful as anything else we ate.  The one bright spot was the jumbo prawn on top - it was delicious.    Dessert.  We had to.  I mean, when in Rome...  We had the Limoncello souffle and it was wonderful.  The perfect end to an (almost) perfect meal.  It was light (oh I'm so overusing that word!) and lemony and tableside, just as it's served, they put a scoop of vanilla gelato smack dab in the middle and it cools it off just enough so that it's ready to eat.  Be prepared to wait a little bit for it - our server told us it would be about 15-20 minutes and it most definitely took at least that long but it was well worth it.    Our server, Rocco, was smashing.  Italian, personable, funny, helpful, professional, knowledgeable and all around fun.  He made the entire experience more enjoyable.  The femme maitre ds were satisfactory - but nothing to exclaim about.  Matter of fact, when we left around 10pm we asked if one of them would take our picture.  She seemed less than thrilled (and I get that it's late and she was probably tired) and barely acknowledged us other than to grab the camera, take a few pics and hand the camera back.  With that said, the behavior (however bad or good) of the front house staff doesn't make or break my opinion of a restaurant but had the ladies been just ever so slightly more friendly and enthusiastic, it would have made the entire experience even better.    Overall, fantastico!  Really.  It's pricey but it's the strip and it's Giada.  I'm a local so I can't see myself going here any more than maybe a few times a year but I will most decidedly be back and when I have guests in town I'll make it a point to recommend Giada.  Cibo eccellente!  Ciao!",

Service is very attentive and the waiters are very friendly. We had the starter platter with the chicken marsala, lobster arancini, fritto misto. It's a good way to try various dishes, although it wasn't my favorite. The mortadella pizzette was just so-so. The dough was good but the mortadella topping was a little plain. I would order a different one next time.  My favorite dish, hands-down, was the lemon spaghetti. It was so lemony and delicious. In my mind I had already thought it would be a regular spaghetti dish but it was 100% better. The ravioli and salmon were satisfying runner-ups.  Only downside is the $$$. It's probably just a special visit here and then because it is heavily overpriced. Make sure to stop by the Photo Booth (by the hostess) before you leave!  P.S. Yes, I saw Giada, but she was too busy (and I was too nervous)! Now I regret it...",

    "text": "Flavorful Italian food with a twist! Coming from a long time fan of her television show, I was delighted to find out on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> that Giada had a restaurant in Vega$! What a great surprise and the food was amazingly delicious.  I started with the mozzarella with citrus chili pesto. I never had mozzarella cheese served this way, typically served caprese style this was a nice twist, but considering the price $11 seems quite pricy considering the size of of the appetizer portion. I will say also, that while good, the taste of the mozzarella did not come close to the taste in Italy.  While I was not up to eating a full five course meal that night, I opted to have the pappardelle with pork bolognese. The pasta was made fresh, you could tell. The flavor of the sauce was very good and while at first the portion size seemed small especially for $32, I must say it was the right amount. For dessert I opted for the limoncello souffle which was out of this world good. If you find yourself at Giadia's, do not miss this gem of a dessert. It is well worth the $14 and time it takes to make fresh.  Let me also say the service was very good too. Our waiter Rocco was from Southern Italy and he was very attentive and went the extra mile to make sure that every aspect of our dining experience was perfect. I think the fact that price vs. portion size is what was the disappointing factor in the overall experience, considering the uniqueness of food parings and quality of ingredients and knowing the restaurant is in the heart of the Vega$ strip in a high rent district - I get it. $122 = modest dinner for two without alcoholic beverages.",

The complementary bread is amazingggg!! My daughter and I were able to split the roasted broccolini, gluten free rigatoni with veggie bolognese, and the summer caprese salad. Salad was refreshing- had watermelon. Pasta was so fresh and yummy! Service was great.  For dessert, we also split the hazelnut crunch and wow. Best dessert ever.  We cleaned our plates. There was no leftovers!!  Also ordered an assortment of Giada's cookies togo  The only thing I was disappointed in was that the cookies didn't come boxed in a cute, fancy little box that said Giada's. For $12 we got 5 cookies in a plastic to go box...  other than that it was great!",

    "text": "I dined at Giada back in 2014 and loved it so I was happy when one of my friend's suggested it for brunch during a Moms' trip to Las Vegas.  We easily made a reservation online on open table for the next day.  Our party of six was seated at a large round table in the dining room.  I loved the natural light, warmth, and chic atmosphere of the restaurant.  Out of habit, I checked in on my Yelp app and found that Giada gives a complimentary \"splash of prosecco\" when checking in.  Of course I made everyone check in as well and we had a nice toast to start of our brunch.  For brunch, you can either order a la carte or from the tasting menu.  I wanted a little of both sweet and savory so I chose the popular Sunrise Polenta Waffle - pancetta, chives, noble maple syrup, bechamel, and two sunny side eggs.  It was delicious and I enjoyed the texture the polenta added to the waffles.    Our service was excellent from start to finish and we had a wonderful time dining at Giada!  Make sure to stop by the selfie booth before leaving!",

For cocktails they have a great selection and I really enjoyed the Barbarella drink with Tanqueray and topped with basil! Their brunch was excellent and the staff are trained very well, knowledgeable, and are helpful in guiding you through the menu if you would like. They really know how to make you feel special whether you are celebrating or just dining for fun.

    "text": "Who knew a \"Tasting Menu\" brunch could be such an amazing experience?  First off, I bought the Living Social package, without the alcohol. Had I been staying over, I would have wisely opted for the alcohol. When I \"checked in' on Yelp, I was awarded a \"splash\" of prosecco- flute is more like it. I also ordered the White peach belini. If everyone, everywhere, started every day with this drink, the world would be a happier place. Where to begin ( at the beginning, of course): The service was attentive yet not obsequious or fawning. Obviously a well-trained staff of professionals! They move, en mass, as though there are choreographed.  The ambience: Is there a better view in LV that doesn't require an elevator? I think not. The room is large yet feels cozy. The chairs are ultra comfortable; the table is set immaculately, and I am entranced by the cutlery. I want to know where I can buy a setting for eight?  The food: We began with a cheese & salami plate, a salad (how do they manage to make capers luxurious?), and two pastries. That, at most restaurants, would have been the sum total of a brunch tasting--not so here. We were just starting.   My husband had the salmon cakes with poached eggs. He is a stickler for the poached egg breaking correctly on an entree, so it was great to see his grin when that golden orb oozed all over the hamburger-sized salmon cakes. I had the Giada Burger. Oh my goodness! The meat was a melange of sirloin and panchetta ground and cooked perfectly medium rare-- served on a brioche bun with an heirloom tomato, peppery arugula, sweet onion, and tangy baby gerkins. To make things even better, on the side there were these potato/zucchini straws. I want the recipe! I couldn't eat it all and still manage the dessert, so I, wisely, had it boxed up at the halfway point. I am so glad I did because the close to this cullinary sojourn is the stuff of memories. My husband had the Chocolate Tower cake and I had the warm-from-the-oven, fluffy, limonchelo souffle with a creme Anglish. We also ordered double espressos which arrived simultaneously with the sweets.  I am stuffed, I am content. I may nap until tomorrow. Thank you Julian C. and the wonderful team at Giada's for a fantastic afternoon!",

Very nice and bright restaurant and server were knowledgeable. Lots of great wine and only show the price per glass. Should add half bottle or full bottle selection.   Arancini. Best arancini I have ever had. Presentation was nice and attractive.   Pork tomahawk. Perfectly made, nicely seasoned very juicy and flavourful.   Fettuccini. Size was quite small but executed perfectly. Noodles were made to al dente and shrimps were cook just right. Sauce were creamy but not over powering with a hint of spiciness. With this portion I think it's slightly overpriced.   Too bad I didn't see Giada :(",

    "text": "Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat. a. BUMMER.  Man, I really, really wanted to like this place! I had been wanting to experience it since it opened and was so excited to finally dine here for my 29th birthday but it was a bad experience beginning to end.  First, against what had been requested, we were seated in a very odd area which seemed to be out of sight. It was extremely hard to get anyone's attention. We had questions regarding items on the menu and the waiter-- not sure if he working a double or just having a bad day-- was very rude and passive aggressive. We asked a question and point blank he asks \"Well what does the menu say?\" Hmm. We know what the menu says but I'm sorry, I'm not a Chef. If I were and had an idea what every single item on the menu meant I wouldn't be asking.  We ordered the carpaccio but asked if the carpaccio could be placed on the side since my friend is vegan. He said absolutely. It wasn't...it was actually placed underneath the salad and some pieces in between the lettuce and she wasn't able to enjoy it. Then it took about 15 minutes for anyone to come back so that we can order more drinks and place our food order. Again, my friend reiterated that she does not eat meat and I specified that I am allergic to fresh mint. We also asked that our spaghetti flights be cooked thoroughly...neither ones of us a fan of al dente (spelling? again, not a chef!) pasta. One of the pasta dishes was beef when we were told it was mushroom and though the basil in my pasta wasn't MINT, it took 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention to make absolute sure I wouldn't die if I bit into it. Did I mention I'm not a chef???  It felt like one hassle after another and now I can see why I've heard people say that this place is overrated. I wouldn't pay to dine here again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on my experience. I'm sure others have had a blast here. Unfortunately for us, my 29th birthday dinner was a bust.",

We ordered Chicken Marsala meatballs (appetizer) and Lobster Hash. Both were INCREDIBLE! The meatballs melted in my mouth. It was so tasty!!! The Lobster Hash had lobster in every bite.

The artichoke appetizer is completely tender with a wonderful range of flavors. The charred octopus salad was amazing and could not have been prepared more perfectly. The veal chop saltimboca was a big hit (and is huge as well) and the bone-in filet was one of the best my husband has ever had. Excellent choices on the wine list - many at quite reasonable prices.

It has an open layout, lots of light inside, and nice windows opening up to a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Everything is labeled with Giada's name. The signs, the placemats, the napkins, even the paper towels in the restrooms!   They first brought us bread which was delicious. I am a huge focaccia fan and the focaccia muffin was so fluffy and had a great herb flavor. They also gave us a thin crispy bread as well that tasted like parmesan. The bread came with salt, a pesto sauce, ricotta spread, capers, and red pepper flakes. The ricotta spread went perfectly with the crispy bread and the pesto sauce was delicious with the focaccia. I do have to say we had to ask for more bread since for three people they just gave us one focaccia muffin, while another table with two people got the same amount. It was just too good to share!  We ordered 2 drinks as well. They were both pretty strong, you could taste the alcohol a little more than I like, and the one with limoncello was too sweet for our liking as well.  For our entrees we got the cacio e pepe for two that was served in a pecorino cheese wheel. This was great! The pasta was fresh and creamy and you could even eat the cheese wheel-which we did! I would definitely recommend this entree, it was fun, unique, and delicious! We also ordered the branzino which was perfectly cooked with crispy skin as well.   It was my birthday, which they acknowledged multiple times, and even gave me a plate with 2 cookies for free. There was a lemon cookie and a chocolate peanut butter cookie, both delicious!",

We shared the hazelnut pancakes and the breakfast pizza and they were both out of this world amazing! The pizza was soft and flavorful with two sunny side eggs and Italian bacon on top. The pancakes had a ton of amazing flavors and a honey syrup that was the perfect addition. We also did mimosas and they were as good as you can get. Can't wait to come back.",

From the lemon and basil spaghetti with shrimp and mascarpone cheese to the cacio e pepe bucatini for two served in a pecorino tascano wheel, yes I said a Pecorino tascano wheel!!!! They say two but it feed three of us perfectly and was hands down the best pasta dish I have ever had in my life. We also had the Italian fried chicken which was just ok and the seared scallops calabrese with parmesan mashed potato which was delicious. Come here for the pasta and make sure to order an extra dish for the ride home. Lol",

I wasn't in the mood for a cocktail, so I enjoyed the Birdie while my friends enjoyed mimosas and sangria. The decor is polished and modern; I have this thing with floors and the tile was enchanting.

    "text": "Something to be said about the food. I dined here this evening 12/19 and was wondering what all the hype was about. The food is what the hype was about. I enjoyed with the table the buratta, prosciutto, and octopus apps. All fantastic those were. Entrees included mustard crusted rack of lamb and lobster ravioli which were both to die for. Dessert I had the molten lava cake which was good as expected.   Now for what was to be desired was the service. We were seated promptly and the wait staff at first was very helpful in letting us know about the restaurant. We had our reservation for 5:00pm and failed to realize on how much the service standard declined when they were busy. The entire dinner took almost 2 1/2 hours as a result. We placed out order apps took around 20-25 min then entrees around 45-50 min. I actually caught myself checking the time on how long it had been since we had placed our order. The only other thing I noticed is that when the place got busy our waiter seemed to disappear. I waited for 20 min for my drink to be refilled and then the last time I asked for a refill they didn't even bring it back by the time I left 20 min later.  Point: Food is good as I expected it to be. The kitchen is doing it right. The FOH however has left little to be desired. This is the reason for the 3 stars.",

    "text": "If this review was about the food at Giada it would be a 5 star review, in fact I'd be petitioning Yelp to add a 6th star because the food is that good. However due to the absolutely abysmal service I received today at Lunch Giada is getting 2 stars. I hope my experience was an outlier & from what I've heard/seen that may be the truth but the service ruined what would have been an amazing meal for me & has probably made it so I won't return any time soon. As I said the food was amazing. Everything came quickly from the kitchen (other than the bread which was a little backed up), but everything was plated beautifully & tasted amazing. We started with the Orzo Meatballs & Prosciutto Dan Danielle to start. The meatballs had a great flavor profile & were cooked to perfection. The Prosciutto was a perfect balance of meat & ham & paired nicely with the warm bread & pesto. Our Entrees were the Venetian Panino & Lasagne, both were delicious & while the portions are a touch small I was happy with them. For dessert we had Zappole which were served with a chocolate sauce G & were a perfect end to the meal. & thus ends the glowing part of the review. Let's discuss the Service: I had a reservation that was made on Open Table, which was a great idea because even at 12:45 on a Wednesday there was a line to get seated. We checked in & were seated within minutes by a very friendly hostess, who informed us we were seated in Christopher H's section & that he would be by with menus in a moment. 10 minutes later, we still haven't seen or heard from Christopher, the busboy notices that we've been seated for a while & brings us over some water, apologizes for the delay & goes & flags down our server.  About 3-5 minutes later he came over & dropped off the menus. He introduced himself & then went on for about 5 minutes explaining the menu in full detail. This would have been great however he was talking in a very hushed mumble & we could barely hear every 5th word he said over the noise in the room. He then said give us a minute to make our decision & he'd come back. Another 5 minutes after we had closed our menus & set them on the edge of the table he finally came over & took our order.  He hurried off & entered our order, the apps came out before the bread which is fine, the runner explained that the bread oven was a \"little backed up because everything is made fresh\" but it came about 2 minutes after our apps got delivered. No big deal, it was delicious when it arrived.  The busby then came by & cleared our app plates & brought over some silverware for our main course. Our waiter came by moments before our entrees arrived & asked if we would like some more bread, to which I replied, \"Yes the bread is great we'll take another\".  The entrees made their way to our table & they were great, the busboy came by & topped off our beverages, but our server is nowhere to be found. No \"hey how's everything tasting\" or \"hey would you like some fresh cracked pepper\" nothing. He is bending over backwards to cater to the 5 top a few tables away from us & the couple seated right next to us, but he never  comes over to our table. We finish our entrees & the busboy scoops up our plates. My aunt wants to check out the dessert menu, however our waiter is nowhere to be found so she gets up, walks over 2 sections & asks a different waiter for a dessert menu. We then place a dessert order with the busboy because we haven't seen our waiter in a good 20 minutes, even though he's been to the table directly next to us no less than 4 times.  Dessert is delivered & our waiter brings out plates & a fork for the dessert course after the food has arrived. I immediately ask for the check as the 90 minutes we've been there was longer than I planned & I need to duck out quickly for work.  He brings the check by & moseys off. I have worked in the industry, I've waited tables in the past & am a majority of the time a great tipper however the service I received at a White Table Cloth Celebrity Chef Spot was not worthy of my usual 20-25%. The bill was about $70, I paid $75, & our waiter took the check & went back to the wait station.  I watched as his eyes got about as big as dish plates & he looks right at me & comes back with the bill to our table. He asks, \"Did I take this too early\". To which I reply, \"No we're fine.\" He then says, \"You do know that here at Giada Gratuity isn't included in the bill?\" To which I say, \"I know, there was nothing about your service that deserved more, maybe if you had actually acknowledged our existence you would have got a better tip.\"  He just shrugged his shoulders & walked off. On the way out the busboy once again apologized for the wait, but once again the server didn't say a word other than to complain about his tip.  I really enjoyed the food & it's a beautiful room, but that service was so bad that I probably won't be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "I am writing this review based on two dining experiences for dinner about three weeks apart.    I will start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Giada and frequently use her recipes and cooking styles in my own every day cooking.  I consider myself to be a great home cook and have been told by many at my dinner table that I am a great cook.  Thank you, Giada (and some other Food Network Stars) for the years of training from the other end of the tv.  EXPERIENCE #1 The first was on 10/24/14 and we were there to celebrate my mother's birthday.  We were a table of three.  I made reservations for this dinner months in advance and stated it was my mother's 70th birthday and on the day of I needed to downsize the reservation due to half of our party not arriving to Las Vegas until later due to flight delays.  We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated about 10 minutes after our time.  I felt as if we were being punished for changing the number in our party because as we were walked through the restaurant there were MANY (at least 5) four top tables available and we were seated at the table directly next to the entrance/exit to the kitchen.  We spent our entire time hearing the servers and runners yell \"corner\" as they darted in and out of the kitchen.  One of those yells didn't work out as a collision occurred and plates went flying and crashing to the ground.  Our server was excellent, he was completely educated about the menu and very attentive to our questions and needs.  He checked in with us almost immediately after each course was delivered to our table.  I wish he could be my server every time I dine out!    The food was very good with all of the courses devoured.  One issue with the food was it was inconsistent between two orders of the exact same dish, the Lemon Spaghetti.  Two of us ordered it and each tasted different (one had a good amount of sauce and the other had hardly any sauce and flavor on the pasta).  Overall experience for this visit would be four stars.  EXPERIENCE #2 The second visit was on 11/16/14.  We were a party of 8 seated at what looked like the only big table in the center of the dining room.  Being seated there was incredible because we could get the full impact of the ambiance of the restaurant.  We were greeted promptly by our server and food service assistant (not sure about the title).  Shortly after, we ordered drinks and then ordered our food a short while after that.  Bread was brought (which by the way is AMAZING) and we were enjoying our experience.  Our food was brought out in courses.  The appetizer course was fantastic.  Next came the pasta and main courses, all brought at the same time.  The sides were brought out about 5 minutes later except my side which was brought out another 5 minutes after that.  Of the pasta and main course dishes, 5 out the 8 were great (especially the risotto which was ordered by two of our group).  Unfortunately, three of the dishes were not good.  We had to send back the lamb because the meat was spongy and two of our group ordered the Bucatini pasta (one of the two vegetarian options that are not a side dish or pizza) and it was completely flavorless.  After one guest sent back the lamb, the server was no where to be found and never checked in on the rest of our meals until 30 minutes later when plates were being cleared.  The two that had the Bucatini talked to the server and sent back their pasta.  The server asked if there was something else that he could prepare and my friend, a vegetarian, asked what was on the menu (other than the Rigatoni with mushrooms which he is allergic to) that he could have.  The server made a very snarky comment...\"I already reviewed the whole menu with you\".  The manager never came over to talk to us about the problems with our meal.  The food service assistant never brought the additional bread that we asked for and when we asked again, his response...\"oh, sorry\" and nothing further.  I have to say that for a restaurant that categorizes themselves as fine dining and for the VERY EXPENSIVE price points, this type of service and the lack of caring that three of the five entree/pasta dishes had to be sent back is completely unacceptable.  When I shared my experience with my friends who are locals in LV, they told me that the buzz around town with the locals is that the restaurant is just average at best.  Overall experience for the second visit would be 1/2 of a star, which is being generous.  I am truly unsure if I will ever return to Giada's restaurant on one of my many trips to Vegas.",

Will never go back as well as the 12 other people with me. Much better values in vegas, this was the worst place I have eaten in vegas and I am there 5-6 times a year for business.",

    "text": "My husband and some friends and I were interested in trying Giada's restaurant since we are fans of her show. We were able to get reservations for 8:15P on a Sunday. We waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. We thought it was such a cute idea that she has a Photo Booth for patrons to use while they are waiting for their table. We ended up getting the tasting menu (everyone is forced to get it at the table, unfortunately), which costs $120 per person. You get to select 4 courses and get an autographed copy of the menu signed by Giada.   The waitress was really nice and they were on top of refiling our waters. My husband and his friend were iffy about the tasting menu because they wanted to get the surf and turf and the waitress offered to see if they could add that to the tasting menu instead. Everyone gets the same first course which is a variety of appetizers. I wasn't a big fan of it because one of plates uses goat cheese and I hate goat cheese. My friends thought the goat cheese was really \"goaty\". One of the other dishes on there reminded me of throw up so I wasn't too keen on it. My next course I got the lemon spaghetti which was not too bad and my husband got the charred octopus (which was substituted by the chef because we asked). The octopus was really good. The portion for the spaghetti was a decent size and I was already starting to get full. My next course was the salmon which was good as well. I enjoyed it and my husband got the surf and turf. We were extremely disappointed by the description of surf and turf. You get about a 6 oz. filet mignon and ONE lobster ravioli. Yes, only ONE. Finally for dessert, the waiter brings out a dessert cart and you get to pick 3 desserts. I picked the nipple of venus (really rich), the tiramisu (awesome!), and the strawberry sorbeto with fresh fruit (so light and refreshing).   By the end of the meal, my friends and I noticed that Giada loves to use capers and lemon in all her dishes. We were kind of sick and tired of it. Capers and lemon are used from start to finish (from the bread you eat to the lemon in the dessert). So 3 stars for lack of variety and for paying $120 per person for a tasting menu, not really worth it.",

    "text": "I was hoping to really love this restaurant since I love watching Giada's cooking show. I made reservations for the Saturday after Thanksgiving 2 months prior for 5 people. They asked if it was a special occasion and stated it was my nieces bday.  First things first the self parking is limited it is shared with the adjacent hotel n a timeshare. So you have no option but to valet. This was at 5pm. We then get to the restaurant and we still had to wait for 15 min for our table and when the hostess sat us we stood their like idiots bc they were still prepping the table. Epic fail!!  When we finally sat our waitress was unprepared.. Trying to give us a menu that was empty so she had to go get another one.. 5min later she comes back takes drink order. She looked disheveled n had no personality.  Food was mediocre for it being a fancy restaurant. I ordered the crab n scallop risotto which had bits of crab shells in it. I told the waitress and her response: oh that happens sometimes n walked away. The scallops were very salty as well. The appetizers were good we had the octopus, calamari n shrimp and some cheese thing which I can't remember the name of. There was nothing special on the dessert menu which I was so surprised about bc Giada makes awesome desserts on her show.  So the occasion was my nieces bday that was acknowledged by 3 people at this restaurant and did nothing special not even a piece of chocolate?? Why acknowledge the occasion if they plan not to do anything I thought that was really weird. The one memorable thing was the photo booth in the front entrance.  In conclusion: reservation service fail, food mediocre and service fail;(",

We are trying serveral restaurants for brunch kinda a bucket list thing. Don't mind paying for great food and service but this fell short on both. First we had a party of 8 and had made reservations so we didn't just show up. Several of us ordered  the bottomless mimosas.  Which only came with 2 refills. Then 3 of our dishes came out undercooked and not warm. Then when we brought it to the manager's attention our item were replace somewhat. The eggs I was given were still under cooked and my meatballs that were raw never got replaced. The manager sent over some desert as a compensation which was nice. Unfortunately I left hungry and still don't know if the meatballs are any good. Our server only came over a few times. This also was brought to the manager's attention and she said she spoke with the server.  Then we asked to see the wine list and that took 30 mins. Needless to say at this point I was very over the whole thing. So I paid the 65.00 for my latte, toast, some berries, and my husband waffle. Won't be back anytime soon hope this feedback will change future experience for someone else.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to Giada's since it opened. I finally went and loved it! The menu has a lot of options but we decided to go with the tasting menu because it had their best dishes. The tasting menu is $120 per person but you get a lot of food. We started with the antipasto of crostini, dates, and peppers. All were just ok but not anything I would choose to order again. Then came the pastas, you get the lemon shrimp or the vegetable bolognese rigatoni. Since there was 2 of us, we got 1 of each and we added truffle shavings on the rigatoni. Both were amazing! The pasta was perfectly cooked and deliciously flavored. I can't even decide which one I liked better. Then you get the main course and we choose the salmon and rack of lamb. The salmon had a light flavor but was good. The lentils that were in the sauce were bland and added really nothing to the dish. The lamb was delicious! It had a mustard crust and was just melt in your mouth good. And lastly you get to choose desserts from the extensive cart. I choose the chocolate tiramisu, lemon ricotta cookie, and white coffee gelato. All 3 were awesome! Overall, I very much enjoyed my experience at Giada's. I only knocked off a star for the antipasto and bland salmon sauce.",

The young hostess was a little \"unconcerned\" but once inside I could not ask for better attention at the bar while waiting for my husband to join me. The bartender crafted \"special\" drinks for us both and each was superb. Bryan our waiter is excellent, explaining the tasting menu and offering suggestions from the main menu and the options are vast. We settled on the artichoke arancini which were fried nicely with 2 sauces and the dry-cured salumi which was simple but exactly as expected. The TriColore kale salad was delicious, lightly dressed and the yellow tomato soup was yummy with fried mozzarella balls. The veal chop saltimbocca is Huge-you better be Hungry-lightly fried with a simple tomato salsa on the side. The Swiss chard with tofu is underrated-it packed a lot of flavor. We ended the meal with chocolate and roasted banana gelato and Giadas's cookies..so yummy. From start to finish this was an excellent meal-not to be missed while in Las Vegas",

Came with an excellent assortment of appetizers to share, followed by a lemon jumbo shrimp spaghetti, and a vegetable Bolognese pasta. Both dishes were good. We preferred the spaghetti. That was followed by our main course. She had the salmon, and I had the best rack of lamb I've ever had (Giada wins the throw down with Bobby Flay! I've had his at Mesa Grill as well). The main dish was accompanied with really good cheesy potatoes and fresh broccoli. Lastly we were treated with a wonderful dessert cart. You really can't go wrong, but the no flour dark chocolate cake, the cheesecake, and tiramisu are excellent choices. The service was exquisite. Very enjoyable, great atmosphere, and decadent yet comfortable. Bottom line is you will pay for a great evening, but it's well worth it! Thanks.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place.  No I wanted to LOVE this place.  You see, the year was 2006 and I desperately needed a break from studying.  I happened to come across a woman cooking Italian food on TV.   She was young, hip, beautiful, and I was just mesermized.  I wanted to know what hair products she used, the name of her polish on her perfectly manicured hands and where she got her unique home wares from.  I was hooked on Everday Italian.  It was 30 minutes of total escape from grad school each week.  When I found the time, I started to cook from her recipes.  They were always a hit at home.  I've been a huge fan since that day.  When I found out Giada was opening a place in Vegas, you can believe my excitement.  So fastforward to Dec. 23, 2014.  I was like a little fan girl about to go to my first One Direction concert.  My Sigoth (significant other) didn't get it but he went along.  But it was excatly like going to a One Direction concert and finding out Zayn was no longer a One Directioner.  Complete and utter disappoinment.  It pains me to even admit it, but I must.  I didn't hate it but I didn't really like it either.  Neither did the Sigoth.  I don't know if I was being hyper-critical because I was eating at Giada's!  I mean these were the select recipes she chose to showcase herself and her brand.  The best thing I had was this signature cocktail, charcuterie and the meatballs.  That's it.  We got a pizza thing that was meh, a couple of pastas (one was the spagetti with the shrimp), it was over salted and terrible.  Just one note, salt.  There was something else we had that we had to send back because it tasted off, don't remember what it was.  I think my experience was a shock to my system so I've blocked off my memory from dining there.  I'm giving one star for the ambiance/decor.  It was beautiful in there, I loved the decor, a lot.  And the second star for the courteous services.  *sigh*",

We each had a pasta and an appetizer. I tried the mushroom aracini - tasted fine. We each tried a different pasta. My husband wanted more sauce on his spaghetti and expected red sauce instead of the lemon sauce that Giada's serves - still tasted great. I enjoyed my lobster ravioli and my mom was pleased with her risotto. We all enjoyed the flavors. Don't expect to get full at Giada's unless you're willing to shell out for a four course meal.",

That said, I called 2 weeks ago and made reser-vations for 3 of us. 3 days ago I received a message from a hostess in regards to my reser-vations and to call them. To my surprise, I was told that if I wanted a window table (to be clear, I asked for a booth 1st and said, if you have a view that's great as well,) ok....now, I was told that if we wanted a window seating we would have to guarantee that we would each purchase $100 minimum per person. I am not cheap. Nor do I like being told how much food to stuff down my gullet. I let the hostess, a snotty, condescending and eye rolling thru the phone little girl name Farell, know my opinion.  I called back and spoke with an assistant manager. I live here in Vegas. I've never ever been told I had to promise to buy a quota of food, much less by a child hostess. If you're into being told what to eat and how much to spend, go for it. There are so many other wonderful places to eat here in this town that I will be enjoying.",

The hostesses were very accommodating as we were using a breakfast voucher bought from Gilt at around 1pm in the afternoon  For an upscale restaurant however, the service was pretty slow. It took a long time for us to get water and our menus, which detracted from the experience.  I ordered the salmon cake Benedict which came with 2 salmon cakes, 2 poached eggs, toasted sourdough on a bed of sauteed spinach with a side of hollandaise sauce. I though the dish was quite well done, the salmon cakes were flavorful, the eggs were poached nicely. However, since it normally costs 21 dollars, I was expecting a little more from both the service and the flavors. It was good but not amazing.  My friend ordered the polenta with bacon bits. She said it was ok but not amazing as well. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, the polenta waffles looked really delicious.   We also ordered two glasses of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. I really enjoyed my glass, but my friend found it to be too bitter and sour.  Overall, this was worth it for the 44 dollar voucher but I would hesitate to go again and pay full price.",

They have a very interesting cocktail menu, I had a drink w/ Tanqueray 10, ginger beer and basil foam which was absolutely fabulous ( can't remember the name).

The ambience of the restaurant was wonderful from the moment I entered. The decor of the table is beautiful and I liked how the tables are placed far enough from each other that you aren't able to hear others conversations. When I visited Giada, they had a special where if you checked into yelp you received a free pour of wine, which was a rather large pour! Be sure to check if they're still offering this deal when you visit. The service my party received was impeccable and you could tell they we going above and beyond to ensure you had the best dining experience. The food was delicious!! I opted for the Wood Roasted Mushrooms pizza with baby kale and gorgonzola dolce which was a great item for only $14. I'd highly recommend to anyone in the Las Vegas area.",

Four little toasts for $18?  They should be four little bites of fantastic flavor.  Fell short.  Oompa loompa short.  The tricolore salad.  Prosciutto was delicious, but I couldn't even eat the rest of the salad, it was drenched in gorgonzola.  Dripping.  The server took it away and never made eye contact or asked why I had not eaten it.  It's vegas, they don't care.  Turn your table and they are on to the next.  Here's your check.    Such a bummer.  I had high expectatons.  Oddly enough, this experience tarnishes her whole brand for me, which I did not see coming.",

Salmon Cakes Benedict won the prize for the presentation and incredible fresh taste!  Polenta waffles with grilled fruit came in a close second as the grill treatment elevated the pineapple to a new level of deliciousness.  Even the caprese omelette produced fresh herbs on top with extremely memorable mozzarella!  Just don't leave without bread and butter (lemon butter that is with three other spreads like almond chocolate and others I can't recall except for the memory of each bite!)  Every tiny aspect literally from the napkins to  the glassware to the decor accessories are obviously hand picked to reflect Giada and her style!  We learned that she visits a couple of times each month and makes sure to interact with guests and take photos with them.  The other chefs in town could take this cue!  We loved this dining experience and cite it as the best meal we enjoyed in Vegas!",

We ate off of the dinner tasting menu, which was a four course dinner.  It was $120/person and so worth it.  The apps came out first which was a couple of sweet peppers with melted cheese, some bacon wrapped spicy sausage, and a few other items.   The bread plate was also great with a large assortment of toppings.   After the apps, I had Bucatini bolognese - delicious.    For the main course, I had a 7 oz filet which was like butter .  We had roasted potatoes and a spiced corn as sides and for dessert we had 3 items each off of the delicious dessert cart.  My gf had the salmon for her main course which was perfectly cooked.   Our server, Luis, was top notch.  Our drinks were terrific.   I honestly can't complain about one thing here.  From the moment we entered, the staff was fantastic. The ambience was great.  The food amazing.   Definitely coming back. Oh yeah, and don't forget to check in on Yelp while there for your free splash of Prosecco.",

    "text": "Despite Giada De Laurentiis being on Food Network, I've always admired her as one of the few chefs on that channel who prepare dishes on TV that aren't replicas of something you'd find in the Better Homes & Garden cookbook.  Likewise, her restaurant at The Cromwell on the Las Vegas Strip is not a cookie-cutter \"celebrity chef\" restaurant on the Strip, eschewing the formulaic darker ambiance, and instead embracing lighter colors, ample lighting, and soft wood accents. However, Giada's best design feature is that, unlike other Strip restaurants that you'd actually eat at, Giada has an entrance directly on the street so that you don't need to walk through a casino to get to it.  The food was very good. Giada De Laurentiis' fingerprints are on the menu, as I recognized most of the entrees as being featured recipes on her shows.  The complimentary bread service was impressive-looking, featuring a focaccia-like bread baked in a ramekin, with accompaniments including garlic puree, mascarpone lemon cream, pepper flakes, fried capers, and pink salt. Anywhere else, this would be ostentatious, but this is a restaurant in a Vegas casino after all.  Lobster Arancini was the first plate I ordered, featuring four small fried arancino balls. Do you love creamy risotto? Fried food? Lobster? Parmesan cheese? Great, you'll love this. Served with a pomodoro sauce made of Calabrian chilis that impart a small bit of heat and a slightly fruity taste. Given the diminutive size of the arancino balls, this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side at $19 -- but worth it.  The Pan Roasted Salmon was another winner. The 7 ounce filet of salmon is mild, wonderfully seasoned, and richly browned on its top, accompanied by a mustard sauce spiked with garlic and thyme. A summer succotash of corn and cannellini beans completes the plate. Again, smaller portions than what you'll generally find out on the Strip. At $39, it is a dish I'd re-order.  I finished my meal with a Chocolate Honey Almond Tart. I've made this myself based on Giada's instruction on Food Network. Here, the preparation and presentation was different, as they don't pulverize the almonds and instead slice them thin and layer them on top of the tart, creating a crunchy texture.   I dined solo at Giada and I was told by the dude who sat me at a half-empty bar at 8pm that they don't serve their dinner menu at the bar, and that I'd need to ask the head bartender for a favor to order anything that wasn't the limited antipasto selection on their iPad bar menu. This was all done and said with a straight face. Once we got past that bullshit, the rest of my experience at Giada was fine.  There are a plethora of \"celebrity chef\" restaurants in Vegas, and Giada is a worthy entry into a crowded scene. If this restaurant was not tied to Giada De Laurentiis, it would still be successful.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.1/4.4/4.0",

    "text": "I'm leaving one star because I can't leave less than that. I have been to many restaurants in Las Vegas and I have to say I have never felt so disgusted at the level of customer service as I have at Gaida. She must really not know that's going on there. Couple of things to point out:  1) Food is extremely over priced for the portion and quality you receive. Nothing special about the plates whatsoever ordinary caprese salads and pasta dishes with tiny portions and no taste.   2) The waiter was something out of this world and so was the management. The waiter asked if we wanted a bottle of wine and I said yes so management brought us a bottle of a white wine we had never even heard of and asked if that was ok... Umm no it's not ok let me see the wine menu and select myself. The fact they didn't even ask us if we wanted to see one from the get go blows my mind (mind you I was in a party of 6). The waiter also took our dishes without asking if we were done with the plates. Can you say rude? You could tell the waiter does not belong serving in a place like that. I also overheard the couple next to us who was eating say they did not like their plate and would like it returned. I literally watched them return it and just finish their two drinks and leave (wish I had been this smart from the start).   The only reason I stayed through it all was because it was my girlfriends birthday and that's where she wanted to go. With reservations and all I still had to wait at least 15 minutes and when they brought my girlfriend a dessert for her bday it was 2 lemon cookies and some icing on a plate that said happy birthday... No small dessert with a candle or anything. Seriously? I wish I could go back in time and had gone to eat somewhere else. Only reason I didn't run out was because I was trying to satisfy my girlfriend but our whole party was appalled by the quality of that establishment. Never again will I go there and I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't waste their hard earned money on a place like that. Hope this review helps someone.  I strongly believe some of these 5 star reviews are people paid by the establishment or people who have no idea what fine dining is really about.",

    "text": "I must admit, I am a fan of Giada's shows and recipe books - so my opinion may be skewed.  We ate here on a Monday night at 9:30pm.  We were seated at 9:45pm, and because we had the tasting menu, we did not leave until about 12:30pm.  I called about 2-3 weeks in advance and had about 2 or 3 time slots to choose from in a span of a week for a party of four for dinner.  So if you want to dine here, call well in advance.    The restaurant is very nicely located in the Cromwell, across from Ceasar's Palace and kitty corner from the Bellagio.  The view from the windows is fabulous, but you'll have to request a window table when you make reservations.  Since we had to wait for a bit for our table, we had some cocktails at the bar. The service was a tad slow, but since they gave us an iPad that acted as the menu, we just played with it and explored the different drinks. Overall our cocktails were okay and cost $15 each.  The tasting menu for the night was spot on with Giada's style.  If you have cooked from her recipes, you know what I mean. The flavor profiles were aligned with what I have made from her books before. Here's the overview:  Bread selection - all of it was very yummy, but the rosemary foccacia was the star. We knew we had a lot of food coming, but we still had to ask for more bread JUST BECAUSE!  Antipasti - a selection of four items.  I forgot the names of everything, but I ate everything but the stuffed peppers with goat cheese (not a fan of cheese).  The other three items were perfect, and I especially loved the eggplant mix.  Second course - my friend and I ordered one each so we could try both.  She ordered the Vegetable Bolognese and I ordered the Lemon Spaghetti with Shrimp.  The Lemon Spaghetti was surprisingly good and the Shrimp were \"ginormous\"!  I personally liked the Vegetable Bolognese more, but both dishes were great.  Again, the flavor profile is SO GIADA.  Third course - I chose the Sicilian Roasted Lamb.  I love lamb, but I must confess that I was SO stuffed because everything before this was so good that I could not truly enjoy this.  It was good, but if I had more space I would probably rave about it more.  I was so full that I could not even try the family-style sides of Smashed Potatoes and Sweet Corn (sniff sniff).  Dessert - as stuffed as I was, because they roll to your table a big cart filled with all types of temptations, I had to try a few.  The gelato was good, especially a coffee flavored one. My only complaint was that it was melting too much.  The cookies were good, as was everything else. Again, I was too stuffed to truly enjoy it.    I wish I had a second stomach for the Third Course and Dessert!  Along with the Tasting Menu, you also get a nice folder with some recipes, the tasting menu you had, and a signed copy of Giada's photo.  The only sad part of this dinner was that I brought my copy of Giada's book all the way from California...and she wasn't there to sign it. Boo hoo. But at least I still got a signed photo.  If I get to come here again with my husband, I'll be making reservations here as soon as we book the trip!",

Single big Ice cubes for rocks drinks and fun egg white foam for clever cocktails. Hostess sits us at about 9. No menus given [i get it they want you order wine before dinner] ok. But we had a long while to look at the menus at the bar. The server comes about 9:15 and asked for wine and cocktails order. We Order a bottle of wine. Takes about 20-25 minutes because it wasn't \"chilled\". Finally wine is served, it's a Pinot ... Could have served it to me right out of storage but anyway.... The entire service from sit down to water service to wine service (both times) to waiting for the dessert cart to roll around was a 3 hour experience. Way to long for this type of restaurant.   The veal was fried.  The bucatini was mediocre at best.  The spaghetti was an amazing house lemon sauce instead of red sauce... Which blows my mind. You can't have a spaghetti on the menu with a lemon sauce. Just breaks all the rules. However the fish was beautiful and light.   Asparagus soup was bland but the tricolor was yum  Octopus was to die for.  Aracinis were not my favorite.  And the dates, well.. I would have expected more.   This place is booked out for a long while and I know they are just getting the hang of things so I'll try it again in a month or so.",

I was here on a Wednesday night, but it was still pretty busy. The person I was with made a reservation for 7:30 PM but I don't think we actually were seated until about 8.   Service was great, but I am mostly referencing the server and the busser. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, as he had been there since the opening. The busser assigned to the section was definitely on top of it for refilling water, which is always so appreciated.  The price is pretty standard for a place on the strip (average about $30-$50 an entree). They did have other options though for more of a set \"tasting\" type of menu. You could choose an appetizer, a side, an entree and a dessert. We didn't go with this option but it was nice that it was available.  I still give a 4/5 because I wasn't completely blown away by the food. I thought it was great, but maybe there wasn't anything particularly spectacular about it for me. I got the scallops and it came with veggies.",

    "text": "Fan of the tv show. Not of the restaurant.   If you get a window seat or close to it there is a great view of the strip. The complimentary bread platter is good, and customer service is mostly top notch.   Why did I give it 2 stars?  I think I expected more flavor?  The portion sizes are what you'd expect of a fine dining restaurant, so no surprise there. But it's not your typical Italian. Everything is lightly seasoned (no garlic, if that's what you're looking for).   I have mixed feelings about the decor- it's sexy chic, but I also felt like the entire place was just a shop to buy some branded merchandise, including the napkins in the bathroom. We get it- we're eating at Giada's.   Now for the real reason I gave it 2 stars:  my meal was underwhelming to say the least.  After the food was served to our table, our waiter stopped by only once, if he had come by again I could've told him that something was off about my meal- the chicken cacciatore.  I did mention this to the man who cleared our plates, virtually the whole dish was untouched- there was a \"scent\" to the chicken.  Regardless I tried to be a good sport, but I've been throwing up since eating that meal. You guys might say--you're in Vegas, come on. But the reality is that I don't drink, and I didn't have anything else to eat after that meal.  I guess I expected more from such a popular chef, but I won't be returning or recommending to anyone else.   For that kind of money, you have a million other options for a great meal!",

    "text": "This was a True 5-Star experience despite no Giada sighting....HaHa just kidding. Me and a co-worker came over here for dinner and was a very short walk from our hotel the Elara by Hilton. When we arrived and this is a little secret we learned. The wait was well over an hour and just as she told us I saw a couple getting up from the bar and yes it's open seating. So that was a huge score and you can order the full menu at the bar. After immediately being seated our super duper friendly bartender Katie greeted us and got us going on our drinks. After a short wait with drink in hand we knew exactly what we wanted. We started with the fresh assorted olives and marinated grilled artichokes. Both of these were so good and the fact we were hungry these didn't last long. Now I am not much of a bread eater but there hot bread served with assorted butters and dipping oils was outstanding.   For dinner I had the Italian fried chicken served cattoire style and best way to say it is basically deconstructed chicken cattoire and this dish was amazing. I ate every last bite of it and cleaned the plate. Has to be one of the best fried chicken dishes I have ever had. My co-worker had the lobster ravioli's and said the same thing about how delicious they were. We also split up some crispy brussel sprouts that were also so delicious and I am sure if you are reading this all the way through the theme of delicious. That's really it in a nutshell this place was amazing hands down an excellent meal all the way around.",

After walking and seated by the window with the view of the strip, we both fell for this place.   The servers were all very nice and made a great wine suggestion. Now the food, if there's one word I could use to describe the meal we ate it's simply: UNIQUE. The quality of everything is great, and 5 star. But the flavors you're experiencing are something you've never had before. Bacon wrapped dates and chicken meatballs were both very great in their respective ways. The pasta was amazing however, didn't enjoy the lemon contrast with the cheese. And that lamb chop was more like a filet which was outstanding. All in all it's a very fun dining experience that I recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Giada, and couldn't wait to try her namesake restaurant.   My boyfriend took me to Vegas for my birthday since it's one of my favorite cities. We've been many times, and have dined at many places on and off the Strip. For my birthday meal I chose Giada since we haven't been and it has been on my list for while. I really would love to give 4 or 5 stars, but I just can't. I think perhaps Giada should revisit the restaurant and make sure that everything is still running to standard. Because if my experience is the standard, then maybe I can't say I'm a fan of hers any more. I'll start with the cons so this review can end on a somewhat positive note.   The areas of opportunity: I ordered a half dozen oysters and they were borderline gross. I love oysters in all forms and these were large and didn't taste fresh and had toppings that tried to mask the state of the oysters. I didn't enjoy the jelly stuff they called \"mignonette pairings\". It was straight up a waste of $23. I couldn't even finish them. And I inhale oysters. Maybe I should have orders the Oyster Rockefeller instead. For my entree I chose lobster ravioli. Also a waste of $36. I guess I was picking all the wrong dishes that night. It was oily and coagulated so quickly. The pasta was undercooked and was hard. The lobster filling was not particularly memorable. And I found a lobster shell that I almost swallowed.   The things I enjoyed: the decor was lovely. The bread course was good. The butter was nice and soft. Nothing worse than hard cold butter. The ricotta crostini was ok. My boyfriend chose it and he loved it. He also loved the seared scallop dish that he selected for his entree (but $40 for 4 scallops?!). The side of broccolini was the highlight of the meal. So that should help sum up my feelings about the food.    It was my birthday and I noted that on my reservation. They didn't encourage us to order any desert or offer a birthday treat. Only when I redeemed my yelp check-in, then they gave me two cookies and wrote happy birthday on the plate. Perhaps my worst birthday dinner experience ever.",

I was very sad that our waitress seems to be annoyed the entire meal.  Not sure what her problem was, but she should have stayed home or chosen another job.  Because of her, I'm not interested in returning. Sorry giadas, there's so many great restaurants to choose from and service literally is everything, you lost me. I was embarrassed for bringing anyone there, embarrassed for Giadas and the namesake and embarrassed for wasting my time.  Who is in charge? Why? Change or shutter.",

The photo booth at the front was cute but took terrible, grainy pics. Good for a laugh though! Limited menu for lunch. I think they really push the pre made, costly tasting menu but I cannot eat that much at a time and I never eat dessert. So, not worth it for me. There is a limited other menu so we both ordered the cannoli (crab). This was incredible.  The plate and serving dish were nice and hot. Took forever to come out though.  Our server was beyond bad.  Now, he did bring out the Yelp check in prosecco. That was good, better actually than my $ peach bellini! No bread plate that I had been so looking forward to from pics. No water refills.  No offer of cheese or anything to grate onto the pasta. C'mon! This is a beautiful, higher end spot! As we were on our last bite, the waiter did offer to take care of us with a few little pieces of flat bread to eat our sauce with. Then, he had the nerve to later charge us for it!! Man.. it was indeed tasty bread though. Well seasoned and fresh bits. The view though... we did get a window seat and a great view of the strip. Service will keep us from returning but I will be remaking Giada's cannoli dish at home! Love her tea towels too and have to figure out a way to order a couple of those. And her plates. We had been really looking forward to this and due to service, it was a bit of a let down.",

The plate came with 4 scallops and some mashed potatoes smeared in between. Somehow, I found the meal quite filling, like perfect portion. I don't know if the price gave a placebo effect but I thought the scallops were SOO GOOD. Flavorful but not over-flavored, with a pinch of something spicy.

I should have known something would go wrong as we were seated in the back in a narrow hallway going to the private room.  However there was a window so I thought it was okay.  We ordered the tasting menu which included the pastry cart, salad, entree and dessert. The pastry cart came, we made our choices and after we finished the salad car came to serve us our salads.  Then we waited...and waited....and waited.  About 30 mins later our waiter came by and said he had checked on our order and it should be out soon.  \"Perfection takes time\" was his comment.  15-20 mins later I waved hum down and asked where is our food?  It as more than an hour after we had started.  He said he would check again and that he had mentioned it to the manager.  A few minutes later the manager stopped by and apologized and said they couldn't locate our tickets in the back.  Something about 2 of the 3 printers not working.  At any rate, they were now making our food.  He also said that he didn't want the customers having such a bad experience so he would pay our bill.  We thanked him and our food eventually showed up.  After dessert, our waiter brings our bill and leaves it.  Imagine my surprise when I looked at it and they were charging us our full amount.  We tried to track down the waiter and/or manager but either were to be found.  We gave up and just left a tip ( hopefully they share tips as the other servers were courteous) and left the restaurant.  Overall worst experience ever at restaurant.  Would be no stars but at least food was okay.  Serious communication issues with wait staff, kitchen, and management.  Not recommending to anyone.",

My first impressions were this place is absolutely stunning! The open air kitchen with all the cooking stations really showed you how authentic her food really is. The decor and everything was incredible!! The window view was worth every single penny!  Our server, Cliff- I cannot being to tell you how fantastic he was. He has great menu knowledgeable, he answered all our questions even as odd as they were. He spent time getting to know us and what brought us to Vegas. He genuinely cared for us ever step of our meal. This was the best 2 hours of my life.   In talking with Cliff, he knew how excited I was to just be there, and on our way out he provided us giadas favorite cookies to go AND a signed copy of the menu. I literally couldn't tip him or thank him enough for this. The only thing that could top it, is meeting Giada herself.  Cliff--you're absolutely amazing and probably the best server anywhere in the world I've ever had!! Thank you again!",

The calamari was HORRIBLE. The batter on it was disgusting and dry, and I did not like the sauce it came with either.    I also had the seared tenderloin crostini, quite disappointing as well.  Not fulfilling and small portion.  Was not a fan of the rock salt on it either.  I would not come here again.",

Last night we came for dinner and it was just alright. I would recommend a lunchtime visit instead. I got the beet salad which was beets, a little green and not much else. Hubby got pasta that was again just so so. The best part of the meal was the drink which was a champagne and Campari mix. Not sure how, but I ended up drinking three.",

    "text": "I've had my eye on this restaurant for a while, and finally got to go tonight - it exceeded all expectations. We usually only get to go to \"fine dining\" establishments on special occasions, so this was such a nice treat. The entire staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful. I cannot say enough, how friendly and amazing everyone working there was. Our waitress, Nancy, was just awesome! She really made a great experience for us, from start to finish. To start, we had the gorgonzola dolce and the prosciutto de parma. Both were so delicious and presented very well. There was much more prosciutto than I expected, which was a nice surprise. For an entree, we shared the chicken cacciatore, which is plated for 2 people. It was 4 large pieces of chicken, so we still had some to take home. The chicken was so juicy, and the skin was just crispy enough to complement it perfectly. Our personal favorite part of the meal, however, was the side dish of potatoes. We were absolutely hooked after one bite, and would highly recommend them to anyone going there. Overall AMAZING experience with not a single complaint to be had.",

The service was slow!!! Caused us to be late for our concert!!  We ordered 2 seafood towers- was not as fresh as I've had at other places, overpriced for quality served!  Tomahawk Ribeye- okay, but nothing special (oh and they forgot my side and brought it out only after we reminded them, so yes steak sat there while waiting for side dish? Really?)   Pasta dishes, no one in the party finished their pastas nor opted to pack up leftovers!!!!   Filet- best thing out of what we ordered. I guess if you had to go to this restaurant, order the filet. (Yes I know, going to Italian restaurant to order filet? (Best of the worse!)  Salmon- mediocre, but nothing special, won't be remembered.   The best part of dinner was the complimentary bread baskets served! Please serve bread before first appetizer coming out!   Yelpers stay away from this place! You are paying to go to a celebrity's restaurant, not the food nor service.",

The date was amazing. Also, the focaccia/ parm tray served with lemon mascarpone butter was amazing! We tried the branzino with citrus and the skin was crispy and everything well seasoned. Thought it was a very good plate. The side Brussels were amazing and crisp, sweet and savory.  So, the only disappointment of the evening was the Spaghetti... :( the waiter said this was giadas signature. Supposedly a lemon parm sauce with capers and a few prawns. The sauce was two thick and nothing pooled on the plate like photos shared here. Lemon was almost nonexistent. Almost like it sat too long before service. Prawns were fabulous. But, disappointed that a signature dish wasn't amazing like I imagined. Plus the guy next to me ordered the same thing and it looked much fresher.  Something to note... the table was too small and WAY to close the one next to it. I'd ask for a different spot next time and go for the window. Service outstanding.",

Amazing how completely packed it was even though walking through The Cromwell was depressingly empty. First impression was this amazing panoramic view of the strip. I was the first of my group to arrive so found a spot to wait at the bar. My plan was just to order a martini, but I can get that anywhere so I decided to look over the fun specialty drinks. What actually got me was I saw someone else's cocktail with this really cool ice sphere displaying Giada's signature G. So I opted for the Destroyer which had tequila, fresh tangerine and basil. Delish! Lucky for me, the friends I went with have a similar passion for food so we order a lot and everyone shares. That way we get to try a little of everything. Bacon wrapped dates, lemon crab arancini, arugula salad with candied lemon and crispy pancetta and the scallop risotto were all amazing. We also ordered the 28 oz bone in rib-eye finished with lemon and topped with a sunny side up egg which I was really disappointed with. Although the presentation of it was impressive, it was over cooked and a bit on the tough side. Unfortunate especially since that is supposed to be one of the signature dishes.",

The service was admittedly meh. Who cares?  The food was scrumptious. All of it. The camponata and pea pesto - oh mmm! We were warned that pasta dishes are smaller than expected by our waiter (\"tasting size\") and then ordered too much food. The pasta portions were a good size - the fregolotto was the only really small portion. We couldn't finish our meats. The minestrone was wonderful and the risotto with scallops was also wonderful.   The cocktail menu was available on iPad. It was more trouble than it was worth - please just give all the guests a regular menu.  Ambiance: beautiful. We had a seat at the window where we could watch the Bellagio fountains. It felt more cozy with the lamps and unique glassware - like a nicely prepared dinner at a friends' place.  If you watch Giada on Food network, some of her favorite dishes will appear here. She does make variations in some of the same things and they are just right. I was delighted!",

    "text": "The view is amazing,  the service was good however I was very disappointed in the food. I watch Giada cooking show on food network channel, I was so excited when my boyfriend told me he made a 6 pm reservation for us last Thursday,  I couldn't wait to go. When we walked in I was amazed at how beautiful the restaurant is.   I will say I  was suprised at how loud the music was blasting,  it sounded like we were in a night club.  Madonna was playing  so loud it was hard to hear what the server was saying to us and it took away from the atmosphere. It was difficult to have a conversation with each other,  the music was too loud.  We decided on the 4 course specialty meal which was highly recommended by our server. The bread was delicious, it was hot and fresh, the rest of the meal went down hill after that. The presentation of the food was beautiful, however the taste was a total disappointment. The server brought out 2 bacon wrapped dates, they were different,  a little mushy they tasted okay. The lemon pasta/spagehtti with shrimp was bland (BTW the dish only had one shrimp which turned out to be a good thing because the shrimp was terrible) The dish was way overcooked, the pasta was soggy and the shrimp was like chewing on a peice of rubber.  The potatoes were too salty, all I could taste was salt,  I couldn't eat them.  We didn't take any of our leftovers with us.  The portions are small so you know it's a red flag when you have leftovers.  I will say the steak had a lot of flavor,  although it was very small, about 2.5 inches long,  it was covered with vegetables and dressed up so it looked bigger than it actually was.  The steak was good,  however the green mystery item next to the steak was awful.  My boyfriend ordered the fish, it was just Okay, nothing great about it.  He didn't eat the vegetables because they were soggy. I wanted to send my meal back, however my date doesn't like the attention when I do that so I respected his wishes.  The server came around with  desert cart and told us we could pick 4 deserts each.  We both chose different items so we could taste 8 of them.  Out of 8 deserts only 1 of them was good, the hazelnut ball was delicious, the rest of the deserts were so disappointing, we didn't eat them. The chocolate cake was dry, the cheese cake was stail. The deserts looked much better than they actually tasted.  Our bill for both dinners,  and one drink was $300. I felt like we lost $300 on a bet.  I would not recommend this place unless it's for a glass of wine and a hazelnut ball. I heard from my colleague who ate here before, the brunch is good however over priced, but hey at least it is good. The food is over priced and a complete  disappointment.  My boyfriend and I love fine dining, we don't mind paying for a good meal and great service,  this meal was barely Okay,  nothing to brag about and since I am a fan of her show it was a total let down. The only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because of the view, otherwise I'd give this restaurant 1 stars.",

This was a disappointment as we were also guests staying at The Cromwell...you would think that they would have few tables \"on hold\" for guests of the hotel--that was not the case, even after he spoke to the hostess on the phone. Lunch selection was limited. I have shellfish allergies and I don't eat red meat--so my choices were sparse. The portions are small, we had chicken meatballs and orzo meatballs--per our server recommendation, and ordered a pizza to share and shared a dessert. The signature cocktail was delish! The food was tasty...wish our server explained portion size so that we weren't shocked and had to order more food. The restaurant was beautiful but we were both unimpressed by the overall experience and still hungry as we left.  I would recommend trying for Dinner reservations...and not the Lunch menu.",

    "text": "I remember when I first read about Giada's back in 2014 - the article indicated that the idea of this restaurant is that Giada wants you to feel like you are in her home.  And that was so True the first time we visited the restaurant in 2014; we sat in the lounge because the dining room was booked; Nicholas Cage and his family were there that evening.  The lounge area was very relaxing and the Italian Californian food was delicious, none of it very hard to leave on your plate.  The service was impeccable and the staff outstanding.  That was then - this is now.  August 2015 - we were looking forward to visiting this restaurant; we were able to secure a reservation in the dining area.  We arrived with anticipation of a great night ahead . . .  our reservation was for 8 pm; we were seated at 8:45 pm - the dining area was busy but not bustling... our waiter robotic; the menu lackluster and expensive for simple items that you can prepare at home for under $10.00.  It was freezing; the vent blowing cold air on us; the waiter robotically kept saying that they could not do anything because of the Casino.  Something was definitely missing and terribly wrong.  The waiter called the manager over and she listened to our plight and was just as robotic ... a lack of customer service which was very disheartening.  We left the restaurant and enjoyed an excellent meal at Gordon Ramsey's.  The service there was impeccable and the food delicious.  No airs, no snobbery.  Just very polite people making sure we were satisfied with everything.  What a difference a year makes.  It's too bad Giada's has lost its soul.",

Although we had a reservation, we did have to wait a bit, which was a little annoying, but Gracie, one of the managers was so nice and apologetic and bought us a round of drinks. In addition, she gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. The ambiance is wonderful. There are few restaurants in Vegas that look directly out on the strip, so you can see the Bellagio fountains dancing every 15 mins. The servers were impeccable. Very attentive, very helpful. At one point, during dessert, we were enjoying our tray of cookies and my partner asked if any of the cookie recipes were in any of Giada's books, and he promptly went and asked and came back and showed us the book where the recipe was. Needless to say we bought the book. Then on our way out, we were showed the photo booth set-up and had a wonderful photo taken of us and now I have it as my desktop! The entire meal was so incredibly delicious and the service so memorable, this has become our favorite restaurant in Vegas. We'll be back often. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "The food gets 4 stars but ugh! the service gets barely 1 star. We had reservations last night at 8:15 and arrived a little after 8. We were told at the hostess stand that they were running about 20/25 minutes behind on reservations. Annoying yes, but we could deal. We got 2 glasses of prosecco at the bar and proceeded to wait and wait and wait. We then got 2 more drinks because we were still waiting for our reservation. I checked in with the hostesses twice and each time they just apologized and said our table would be ready soon. Finally at 9:10 we got our table. The hostess asked my husband while we were walking to our table if we were celebrating anything (our reservation had noted that it was my birthday) and he said yes, her birthday pointing at me. The hostess wished him a happy birthday and he said no, its her birthday and she said \"oh\" - and kept walking never wishing me a happy birthday (I was several feet behind them so didn't hear about the conversation until we were at the table). When we got to the table, the hostess simply pointed at our table and left. SHE DIDN'T PULL MY CHAIR OUT or anything. Our waiter appeared 10 minutes later and handed us our menus. He showed us the tasting menu and then disappeared without explaining the rest of the menu, making suggestions or anything. I think we must have gotten a bad waiter or something though because I heard waiters at other tables going to great lengths to explain the menu to their tables. When our food came, they brought us a corn side dish when I had ordered peas. Not a big deal, when I brought it to our waiters attention, he apologized and took back the corn dish. A few minutes later he reappeared with the peas and the same corn dish saying the corn was on the house. It was weird that he took the corn and even weirder that he brought it back - mistakes happen all the time at restaurants like this but the wrong dish is always left at the table since they can't (hopefully won't) serve it to anyone else. Proceed to dessert, which they have a beautiful cart and a very nice gentleman serving it for you. Mid-way through my dessert though, our waiter brought over an empty plate that had \"happy birthday\" written on it and said \"sorry, happy birthday\". Totally awkward. I mean at least put a piece of chocolate or something on the plate, but an empty plate? At least the food was good - not great but good. Orzo meatballs and proscuitto as a starter were good but of equal quality to whole foods. Pasta and risotto dishes were delicious - the only stars of the night. Dessert was ok - raspberry and peanutbutter tiramisu and polenta cake. Overall not impressed.",

Little did I know that I needed to request at that time not to be seated in the worst part of the restaurant (basically a room sectioned off from the rest of the restaurant with obstructed views outside). I asked for better seating and was told by the hostess that I should've asked for a better table when I made my reservation.  Yes, I guess I should've known when I made a reservation at a restaurant that was going to cost me hundreds of dollars that I needed to request not to be seated in the dungeon. A place that people go on vacation and couldn't possibly know there was a chance I'd be seated in the restaurant's prison section.  We did wait to get a better table that was basically in the \"hallway\" between the dungeon and the main eating area which was to a degree an upgrade.  But you would think they would relegate that room to walk-ins and not people who made reservation and dressed the part.  The food is worth going, the wait staff was great, you can guess how I feel about the hostesses, but if you do go REQUEST A GOOD TABLE or you might be quarantined.",

    "text": "Really disappointed in my Easter lunch.  I was so looking forward to experiencing Giada's as I love her show and her upbringing resembles mine.  When we were seated at the table, our waiter came over to tell us right away about a \"fire\" they had on Friday night in their pizza oven so no pizzas were available.  I would think if a large portion of the menu was not available, they would maybe add additional items like some pasta dishes.  The special of the day was lasagna and one other pasta is on the menu.  I asked if the pasta could be made with another sauce as I did not want the carbonara sauce, I was told simply no.  I am a big fan of small plates and ordered some antipasta items.  The mushrooms were ok, but lacked flavor.  The orzo meatballs were small and also lacked flavor.  The burrata cheese was tasty, but was served without bread???  NEVER in my whole life could I imagine a traditional Italian restaurant not serving bread.  We were told Giada didn't like how it was coming out so it was taken off the menu.  I have a thought...if your staff isn't able to prepare bread to your liking, there are several tremendous bakeries in town, maybe give them a call?  When we were done with these 3 very small plates, we decided to leave and have our holiday lunch at Olives instead.  Great service, great food, and a much better atmosphere.  I wish Giada luck, with all the fabulous restaurants in town, her staff will have their work cut out for them.",

We were accommodated but the hostesses were not very friendly. Not sure if they were nervous or if the staff is supposed to be a little pretentious. We received the tour of the kitchen and our server was good, but he seemed to be trying to hard. We felt a bit uncomfortable.  We have eaten at other fine dining restaurants and the servers were proper but  a bit more friendly and relaxed.  The food was ok, definitely didn't leave there raving about it. We had the ricotta crostini that was pretty good but portion was really small, the size of the crostini could have been a little bigger for the price. My husband and I both had the lemon pasta again small portions but I thought it was good and had good flavor however there was not enough sauce. We didn't have dessert but the desserts looked pretty. Overall it was just average. I was expecting a lot more since it is Giada.",

If you don't want to spend that money then don't go. And if you are complaing then your probably trying to get something free out of it. Like one person who complained then continued to say they didn't even offer us a free dessert. Really? Shocking.  I go out to eat all the time and never once did I go on yelp and blast a restaurant like some of these people do. If you don't like it who cares. Don't go back. Do you really think I'm going to listen to you guys? I will make my own decisions.  With that said I have been to Giada. About 4 times already. Why? Cause I know good food. Because I don't listen to other people. The mushroom pizza, the shrimp pizza are amazing. Great flavor combos and the pizza dough is light and crispy. Coming from the east coast you can't get good pizza out here. This by far is the best. The antipasto is like none other in Vegas. It's a,meal in itself. Have that at the bar with a drink and your set.  I basically tried all the pastas. And yes again it was great. Service is always spot on and so are the bartenders. Now if you don't mind spending money, because you are eating ON THE STRIP,  and you have an understanding about food this is the place.  For her first restaurant, it's a great start.",

The amazingly cramped table for two, the indifferent service and the menu turned us off right from the start. The only thing Italian about the menu is the pasta course, and you get only four ounces of pasta for around $30. We're willing to mortgage the house for good food, but you can't feed a gerbil on four ounces. The main course selections are four meat dishes. Nothing Italian there: steak, pork, etc. When we told the person we took to be the lead waiter that we couldn't drink anything alcoholic, he turned around and vanished, and we were left sitting there alone for the next 15 minutes. If you've seen the restaurant scene from \"LA Story,\" you'll get the idea. I guess that's why they call it \"California\" Italian.",

    "text": "This new place is, indeed, A-OK. With no reservation we decided to check out Giada in the lounge which has a limited menu.  We were told it's first come first serve starting at 5.  We got there just after 5:30 and were greeted by a woman at the base of the escalator.  She took my name and said it would be 20 minutes.  That's okay except there isn't a stick of furniture in that space so you either have to go into the casino or stand around like an unwelcome party crasher.  After 20 minutes she said it would be another 10 (she said I was \"clocked in at 5:42 and it was then 5:58.\"  I said that by my Iphone we had arrived at 5:35. It felt ridiculous to quibble about minutes so I let it go.  A short time later she sent us upstairs where most of the lounge tables had \"reserved\" signs.  So much for first come first serve. Now for the good news .....   The room is gorgeous.   The staff is attentive.  Eric, at the bar, was wonderful, informative and solicitous.   They brought the wonderful bread service which I wanted to devour but held back to leave room for other things. We ordered one of the antipasti platters with artichokes, caponata and olives.  Liked it all.   We ordered the vitello tonnato.  It was a tasty enough bite was NOT vitello tonnato.  It is a slice of veal topped with a slice of seared tuna on a crostini.  Couldn't taste the schmear of sauce. Eric explained that everything is \"Giadafied\".  Okay. But don't call it something it's not. I had just watched an episode of Food Network Star where Giada warned a woman not to call something Serrano ham if it isn't.  So, call this dish something else.  I shared my view with Eric and he brought us another dish to try.  Anchovy crostini.  I wouldn't have ordered it myself but it was wonderful!! Like a deconstructed Caesar salad. We also had arrancini and dessert cookies.  Both OK but unexceptional.  I wish they offered pasta at the bar. I would have liked to try one. I will certainly go back but I hope they sort out that very unpleasant greeting.  Not a nice way to start the evening.",

We went on Sunday around noon and got seated right away. we started with the orzo meatballs which were pretty good and then I had the lemon pesto grilled cheese. My cousin had the baked pasta of the day. We both enjoyed our meals but we definitely weren't as impressed as one would think for a celebrity chef restaurant.   However the ambiance was very open and pretty with good views and the wait staff was superb so all in all, a good lunch visit.",

We made reservations for a Thursday brunch and gauging by how empty the place was I don't think they were needed.  We tried the Orzo meatball appetizer which was 5 small meatballs in a delightful sauce.  The meatballs were moist and tender with good chew and flavor $15.  For our entree's we ordered the Carbonara pizza, cheese bacon and quail eggs on a flakey crust $18.  The pizza was not large but had good flavor.  I felt it would have been better with pancetta instead of the large pieces of bacon but overall it was good.  We also ordered the gnocchi which were served in the same sauce as the meatballs $17.  The coffee was disappointing as I was expecting a rich strong brew but got a mild cup of joe $6.  Overall nothing stood out at Giada's which was disappointing since we love her on the Food Network.  All of the food was good but there was nothing that would bring us back.  In addition since prices are on the higher side it would be nice to have some complimentary bread or fruit with your meal.  I know this is petty but a place shooting for upscale should make the patrons feel indulged and I felt like this place was cutting corners.",

    "text": "I struggled deciding between three and four stars with Giada. The food is solid, the decor and views are great, but it is a reach at the price point. We were sat right on time with our reservation. They gave us a nice seat next to the windows looking over the strip. You get good views from nearly every seat to be fair.  The service was pretty good through out. The wine list is extensive, but fairly expensive. They do have some moderately priced by the glass, but not much by the bottle. That is ok, just be prepared.  For my meal I ordered the Veal Chop Saltimbocca, milanese style. It was a large slab of on the bone-in veal chop. It was tasty. The combination of flavors and textures come together nicely. I was happy with my selection.  We chose a few sides for the table. I only tried the Sweet Corn & Sausage with chili oil & mascarpone. It was a unique take on the standard corn side. The flavors are bold and great. Everyone was happy with this choice.  Overall this place is well worth a visit. They decor and views are on point. The food is good. I just feel like it is a touch expensive for what you get. That being said, if friends wanted to try it I would go again.",

Took the cookies home and tried them two days later and they were still fresh and chewy. I was pretty amazed to see many of my favorites chefs restaurants in Nevada and Giada is one of them, if you love Giada and food network this lovely cafe/store it's a must try .",

You take this escalator up and the hostess station looks strait out of her Food network show's set. Once we were brought into the main dining area, WOW! , absolutely gorgeous views of the strip especially of Caesars and the Bellagio fountains. We were excited to get seated there and even though there looked to be available tables, they placed us in one of the wing corners instead. Not saying there was any discrimination but it was easy to notice that our corner was where all the minorities were and were minorities were getting seated. I didn't see any minorities in the \"premium seats\" in the main area even with available looking tables. #onlythefacts   2 star experience.   Our server, Tim, was awesome just super hospitable. He knew the menu in and out and made some great recommendations, just very polished. 5 star experience.   I really appreciate how the restaurant caters to vegans, vegetarians, and those with food allergies. 5 star experience.   The food was like lighter Italian. You're started with a bread basket filled with house made focaccia, lemon thyme flatbread, and some parmesan breadsticks. We shared a few things, Giada's favorite Mortadella bianca pizzette ($11) a pasta dish ($3X), ordered a couple cocktails off their ipad menu (Barbarella $15 - tanqueray, orange spice ginger beer, lemon, basil foam). Just nothing to get overly excited about. I guess it's a little better than the Olive Garden. 3 star experience.   Overall probably 2.5. Wouldn't recommend it.",

I actually loved siting in the lounge, though- the decor in this place was GORGEOUS! Marble table top, napkin linens and an iPad to flip through the menu- also loved the water glasses! So unique!   We loved the garlic knot and bread platter they started us with- so good! We got the chicken meatballs which were OK, definitely liked the strawberry bruschetta a bit more but between the two was a perfect starter.   My entree was the spaghetti dish with lemon and shrimp which was divine! The spaghetti was delicious, cooked al dente, with a super creamy sauce. Only thing is that the portion is pretty small, but I was stuffed from the starters anyway.   Also have to note the Cosmopolitan blanco was outta this world!!!! Loved it! Couldn't taste the alcohol and loved the cherry at the end which is apparently been soaked in brandy!? Genius!   Will definitely be back here when we return to Vegas!",

Then dinner came and I ordered the ribeye to share with a friend. It was completely inedible. I spit most of it out in my napkin and plate. So horrified the the meat was not chewable.

Absolutely.   We had a reservation for brunch at 12:30. Arrived a few minutes before and were told they were a little behind and it would be about a ten minute wait. It ended up being about 15 but wasn't too bad. The hostess gave us menus to look through and they have a free photo booth in the waiting area.   We were seated and promptly greeted by our server. I wish I could remember his name but he said he was the head server for lunch. He was awesome. Made some great recommendations. 4 of us ordered the unlimited mimosas and he was on top of it the entire meal without us even asking.   For food, we ordered a bunch of dishes I'll explain below.   Baked pasta: it was lasagna the day we were there. I would rate this 3/5. The pasta was extremely soft so not my favorite. The flavor was great, though.   Orzo meatballs: again the texture not so great. Very soft and falling apart but the flavor was great. 4/5  Carbonara flatbread: really great  very tasty and a generous portion for sharing. 5/5  Lemon pesto grilled cheese: soooo good. My favorite dish of the day. Definitely get this and add the prosciutto 5/5  Caress frittata: delicious, nice serving. 5/5 must order for brunch!   Someone from our table ordered the Breakfast American and it looked amazing. I tried the sausage meatballs and they were delicious.   I definitely recommend this for brunch. I haven't had dinner but next time I'm in town I will definitely try!   Prices are fair, servings are nice, it was a great plan to order and try a bunch of different items to share amongst the table.",

Finally made it to Giada after a year or so of me driving past the Cromwell, looking up and saying...I need to try that restaurant. The brunch menu was being served at the time of my visit so brunch it was.  Two plates were ordered for me and a friend as well as a side. First was the breakfast American which contained delicious pieces of bacon, over medium eggs (my friends choice), lemon smashed potatoes, and toast. The potatoes were delicious! The lemon flavor was great and not too sour. The toast was a bit dry but still good. This was resolved with the yolk from the eggs but some butter next time would be nice as well.  The potatoes from the lobster hash weren't as flavorful as the potatoes from the first dish but taste clean and fresh. When it comes to the flavor of this dish its all owed to the lobster and bacon. There was a lot more lobster than I expected on this dish and it was delicious, The Nueske's bacon in the dish taste a lot smokier and flavorful than the bacon from the last dish with tons of tomatoes, peppers and onions to compliment it. Let's not forget that egg on top with all that yolk that came pouring into the hash. The yolk also served the same purpose for the toast with this dish as it did for the last.  To finish off brunch, I had the chia seed parfait. This is one of the best parfaits I've tasted. Lots of chia seeds in maple Greek yogurt combined with raspberries and almonds. My regret...not ordering another. It was gone before I knew it. I should have eaten it a lot slower to savor the taste.  Brunch at Giada was a refreshing intro to her restaurant for myself. Fresh flavors, a relaxing decor and a nice breeze that flowed throughout the restaurant from the outside. Looking forward to trying plates from the dinner menu on a second visit.   Brunch 4/2/2016",

    "text": "Giada at The Cromwell hotel on the Vegas strip is the finest Italian Restaurant I have eaten at in the United States. I have traveled the world and have to say that this is authentic Italian at its best! The location on a prominent corner of the Vegas Strip is magnificent and overlooks the dancing waters at the Bellagio hotel across the street. Large windows wrap the entire corner and give a panoramic view never before seen in Vegas. The interior is beautiful with indirect lighting that makes everyone look great and sets the mood for a wonderful evening. The chairs are comfortable and encourage a leisurely evening. Start with a specialty Italian inspired cocktail, not seen on many menus. Beautifully presented and delicious!  For starters, the Antipasti selection is amazing. We totally enjoyed the marinated olives, baby sweet peppers,the soppressata (with garlic and pepper)and the parmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey was exquisite! Fabulous bread is baked and served in a mini dutch oven alongside Sea Salt and basil aoli and capers and chili flakes and silky soft butter.  We shared the rack of lamb- mustard crusted and the Pappardelle with pork ragout (not usually seen) and both were to perfection! For dessert we had the limoncello souffle with house made buttermilk ice cream and lemon hazelnut cake tower with lemon curd on top .Both desserts rank among the most delicious desserts I have eaten in a restaurant. Do not miss trying the lemon ricotta cookies topped with lemon glaze, an absolute must!  Carissa and Greisy  are doing a remarkable job making this restaurant a Not To Miss destination while in Vegas. Personable and professional and friendly, these two know how to run an outstanding Italian eatery. Do not miss the opportunity to experience this magical environment, it does not exist many places these days. I look forward to many future visits. Jeff Z.",

Looking forward to a pleasant Italian dining experience, we made reservations 2 weeks prior. We anticipated a multi-course gourmet experience and price tags around 150-200 per person. This is not something we can afford to do often, so once or twice a year, we decide to treat ourselves.  Starting with the host staff, they were high school aged girls, dressed for a club in slutty dresses, with ZERO apparent training in hosting. They were clueless of anything other than shoving cattle down the chute. The restaurant was hot, loud (pop music blasting so we had to raise our voices to speak), and we waited 5 minutes for our server to show up. She was overly pretentious, pretty much just for the sake of being pretentious. Keep in mind, we have dined in several white table cloth, sommelier hiring, jacket and tie requiring establishments, and understand fine dining. This was not fine dining, but some strange pseudo-fine dining treatment. The iPad for cocktails was filthy, the counter next to our table was covered in crumbs, and all the wait staff looked disheveled. None of their uniforms had seen an iron or bleach in quite sometime. After a few minutes, we just walked out. This is not a fine-dining experience, so if you want a pleasant evening with special treatment by a professional staff, this is not for you.",

Fresh burrata cheese for breakfast! Yes please! I have had the polenta waffles (both sweet and savory versions) the Salmon/ lettuce/ avocado/ tomato sandwich, and the salmon patties for breakfast. Clean plate club every time! As for dinner, hands down go for the tasting menu if it is your first experience. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with sausage. Unforgettable little bite of happiness. Lemon Spaghetti is out of this world. The prawns are enormous. I went home and tried to recreate from her cook book and came close but no cigar. It is phenomenal. The Bronzino was so light and well balanced. I will have a difficult time deciding what to order when I return in a few months.  Pizza was also excellent. They are not huge so I would suggest apps and salads to make a meal out of it. Dessert cart comes around... Lemon ricotta cookies are a must. Take cookies to go if you are full. Finally, the quality of the staff is unparalleled to any other. Valentino and \"Turley\" will take care of you like you are guest in their home.",

    "text": "Local review, so I may be biased because of course you can find better priced meals anywhere off of the strip, but it was my birthday so we decided to venture out. We had the choice of having the pre-chosen courses for $120/person or just decide on our own. We decided to choose our own, and it came to exactly the same price per person. We had: Lemon Crab Arancini $19- Okay, but it sort of fell apart Pea Pesto Crostini $15- good Arugula Salad $15- It was supposed to come with candied lemon (whatever that is) & crispy pancetta. There were maybe 3 pieces of pancetta. It was basically a plate of argula and olive oil & balsamic vinegar for $15. Definitely not what I expected. Caprese Salad $19- the mozzarella was very good & fresh Risotto $32- good, very creamy and light and fluffy Ravioli $36- ok Surf & Turf $56- This is when I had to remember my Italian that I took in college. That plural ends in an \"i\" so when I saw raviolo instead of ravioli, I thought it was strange that you only get 1 raviolo.. really Giada? So your turf is a poorly cooked piece of meat, be sure to check and send it back if your medium rare comes out medium or well done. And your surf is 1 raviolo stuffed with crab. This was very disappointing for $56 dollars!! Salmon $39- was okay, slightly raw, but I'd rather have slightly raw salmon versus dry and over cooked salmon. But here's the kicker, it was placed ontop of lima beans and corn. Pretty sure the lima beans and corn came from the freezer section of my local grocer.   I was disappointed. Again, maybe it's because I'm a local and I could eat elsewhere or even my own kitchen for a whole lot cheaper and probably the same if not better prepared/cooked food. But it was an experience... an experience I probably won't have again, but an experience nonetheless and I'm okay with that.",

    "text": "I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday dinner with two of my girlfriends and I was extremely disappointed!!! I should have gone with my gut and gone to Olives or Tom Colicchio's restaurant instead!      It took about 10 minutes after us being sat for the waitress to finally approach the table. The restaurant did not have enough paper menus and they tried to play it off by giving us an iPad that did not have the entire menu on it. When we asked for menus they gave us one and said \"they are looking for more around the restaurant\". We finally ordered cocktails for the table and thinking that by ordering \"Giada's Signature Cocktail\" it would have the cute/fancy \"G\" that you see in the pictures. Nope, it didn't. When we asked why it was not there the waitress replied, \"They lost the G and haven't had the chance to find it\". The drinks took awhile to even come to the table and the waitress said that the bartender is backed up so she went behind the bar herself and grabbed the bottle of wine to pour the glass herself.  Perhaps she shared that information to get a bigger tip? It was awkward. As we were looking at the menu I asked for bread to be brought, her response, \"We normally bring that after we pull the menus but sure I will have Jacob bring you some\".       We ordered the pizzette to start, it was boring and bland. They have a \"tasting menu\" but the waitress didn't even explain what it entails. However, we did see the dessert cart going around. However, you can only look and order from the cart if you have ordered this tasting menu. For our entree we actually all ordered the same thing, the spaghetti with the shrimp. The waitress described the dish and it sounded so delicious and was a favorite on the menu so we just had to try it. It was $32 for the dish and believe me, nothing to write home about. We expected a lot more and were left once again, disappointed.      Then our waitress brought the dessert menu. The espresso drinks were $13 and up and the desserts didn't really appeal to us. At first we ordered espresso and I asked if I could order the lemon ricotta cookie. On the menu they have \"Giada's favorite cookies\" which is a variety of cookies. I told the waitress that I wanted to just try the ricotta cookie and she said, let me ask my manager. At this point we were so over being there for hours, the slow service, awkward flow of the evening, and unimpressive meal we just wanted to get out of there and grab our espresso at Starbucks across the way! I decided to walk over to the waitress to cancel the espresso order and she responded, \"Oh man are you sure? I spoke to my manager about figuring out how to charge you for the cookie and he said that he would just take care of it! We know you chose us to celebrate your birthday and we want to do something special for you!\" I was like wow that is nice at least, we will take the cookie but still cancel the espresso. So then the cookie comes out on a special plate that says Happy Birthday and it was a good cookie, pretty much the only decent part of the entire meal.      Then we get the check, there are not enough pens for the table, not surprising seeing how the evening played out. When we looked at the bill they charged \"Open Food $2.00\". THEY CHARGED ME FOR A BIRTHDAY COOKIE AFTER THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. WHO DOES THAT?! We just spent $190.00 on our meal and you charge TWO DOLLARS for a cookie?!      At that point it was the icing on the cake and I was officially over Giada and her lack luster restaurant. We will definitely not be coming back here! If you want to spend a lot of money for extremely slow service and an unimpressive meal than be my guest but I highly recommend staying away!!!!!!",

    "text": "Had a really wonderful breakfast here this morning.  We made reservations, as recommended, and were seated immediately upon arrival. Our seats were right on the strip. I would warn that if you're not prepared for the noise, you may prefer inside. But it's Vegas, everything is loud.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very inviting. Our server was wonderful. She was attentive and helpful. I let her know when we sat down that we were using the groupon. I didn't have to say more (I'm sure they're used to people using the Groupon), she brought our complimentary champagne.  We ordered the pastry selection (4 pieces) and each was great- the scone being our absolute favorite.  I opted for the caprese frittata (sans pancetta) and it was light yet filling. My husband had the \"American\" breakfast with the meatballs which were an interesting and great compliment to the eggs and potatoes.  Overall, we had no complaints so this meal gets 5 stars!",

You'll never forget where you are because Giada puts her name on EVERYTHING. The tasting menu even comes with a full page photo of the famous chef. The photo booth in the waiting area was fun, and is free to use. I don't see anyone stopping you from using it even if you aren't eating at the restaurant.  The best thing I had were the bacon wrapped dates and the tricolore salad. For all the hype, everything else wasn't really any good. We tried the Chicken for 2 since it was featured in a food magazine, but it was super dry and really nothing special at all. I know Giada doesn't eat a lot of what she cooks, but she probably wouldn't even look at this chicken.   I would also skip the pea pesto crostini and the octopus. You can get much better food at a much cheaper restaurant.   With all the negatives about the food, you can't deny the perfect location on the strip - right on the corner of the Cromwell, and the great service by the professional waiters. It's super fancy.",

Banana, roasted pinenut gelato, o-m-g! Soo good!!! Tried her infamous lemon ricotta cookies, well they weren't that bad, they were pretty amazing.  Wednesday, since we missed breakfast, decided to do breakfast here on our last day (spoiled much?). Salmon cakes with perseco hollandaise, yum! I am still thinking about the strawberry jam on the tray they gave us with our breakfast. How do you make that and why isn't it bottled and sold? Omg! My friend got the polenta waffles, they were creamy, crunchy, perfect! This reminded me of the polenta cake they used to have on the dessert menu with the strawberry sauce! (The jam reminded me of the sauce, too). The sad part about breakfast was the amazing chocolate orange mio heaven in a cup drink I had on Tuesday wasn't available because the espresso machine was down. My friend saw my face and I was honestly on a verge of tears. (I am not exaggerating). I settled for 3.5 cups of house coffee. We knew we were in for breakfast, but we asked our kind server if they sold the ricotta lemon cookies and they do 4 for $8, we got 2 orders to go ;)  No need to say how amazing the service is. Always so informative, friendly, prompt.   I love Giada's! What a treat!",

Great location but the wait for a table was a bit much, so sit by the bar and enjoy a well made mimosa by their very friendly bartenders. Good service by Giovanni",

    "text": "Today, while on vacation from out of state, my husband and I took our two young daughters to Giada's.  My daughters follow Giada on Instagram and watch her on the Food Network channel.  They  were so excited when we told them we were taking them to Las Vegas and stopping at Giada's.  We arrived at the restaurant around 4:25 pm and were advised by the curt, unfriendly hostess that Giada's was available only by reservations, but she could probably seat us at 5PM when it officially opened.  We were not hungry for dinner at that moment, only wanted coffee and desserts.  The hostess informed us that we could only sit at the \"lounge\" and not the dining area since we were not eating dinner. No restaurant has ever told us such a thing before, but we were willing to play by their rules.   At 5PM, we did as instructed by that hostess and went and found the \"lounge\", which, by the way, is in the corner by the restrooms.  We waited patiently for a staff member to wait on us, or even approach us, and nobody ever did. In fact, none made eye contact with us or greeted us.  At 5:10 I went back to the hostess stand, to that very unfriendly hostess, and inquired about how to go about getting waited on.  She hardly made eye contact with me and only said someone would come wait on me.  Nobody ever came.  A few minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and asked to speak to a manager.  The hostess informed me, barely making eye contact, that she would get a manager, but I never saw her make an attempt to contact anyone.  A few minutes later, as we still sat waiting in the corner \"lounge\", she came to us and told me that the managers were in a meeting and not available.  I informed her that it wasn't acceptable and wanted to speak to a manager at once.  She walked away, never saying a word.  Five minutes later, a manager approached us and listened to my story as written here.  He informed us that the \"cocktail waitress\" that was due to wait on us did not start her shift until 5:15.  He did not appear to be too concerned about the poor customer service his hostess provided, only offered us to stay and he would \"check\" to see if there was a dining table available.  At this point, my daughters were crushed as the Giada they follow and watch on tv did not match the personalities of the staff and air about this restaurant.  Needless to say, we left the restaurant, but completely disappointed at the very POOR customer service this beautiful restaurant offered. I found it interesting that only three tables were occupied as we left, yet for some reason there was no room for us.   We have gone to many restaurants in our travels and never before did we feel like we were not welcomed as we did today at Giada's.    As a mother to my girls I was disappointed for them and had to explain to them what it meant to be treated like we did at this restaurant as they had never experienced this treatment.    As a paying customer, I was angry at the lack of customer service for such a high profile restaurant.  Giada should definitely be made aware of the poor staff that runs this restaurant.   Don't waste your time and money!",

    "text": "As huge fans of Giada, we decided to try her restaurant ...  TL;DR - someone has licensed her name, photos, recipes, but I highly doubt she has any personal involvement in the running or quality of this place especially considering 1 in 3 reviews are 2 stars or below. This would explain why a famous chef has a restaurant not at a major hotel. Look at Jose Andreas, Wolfgang Puck, Julian Serrano, Emeril, etc .. all at major hotels. Pretty easy to put two and two together on this one. This is just a \"tourist trap\".  Here goes ...  Waiter - he was in a huge hurry. Only 2 out of the 5 of us were ready with our drinks, he insisted on putting them in. They arrived, then he was MIA for awhile, put in the rest in, by the time the 2nd set of drinks arrived, the first ones had been slowly diluting for at least 15 minutes. There was no reason to rush. On a Saturday night there were more staff than patrons.  The tasting menu has some recipes etc. If no one at your table orders it, they take it away even if you want to read it. We ended up asking another waiter if we could see it again.  Food - a pizzette and a 7oz ($65) filet that was ordered, arrived COLD (so far below room temperature you have to wonder if both these items came out of the fridge and someone forgot to warm them up?).  I had the Veal Chop and although it was tasting, it was most likely fried in a very low quality/cheap oil because two days later, I still have some serious bloating.  Noise - Maybe the loudest \"fine dining\" restaurant I've ever been to. The restaurant was maybe 50% full and it was so loud, we couldn't hear each other at our own table.  For the \"$$$\" rating for this restaurant, it is not worth it. We had dinner the night before at Lago at the Bellagio and had one of the best meals we've ever had in Vegas.  Sorry Giada! You sold out your good name to someone who is ruining it. The reviews speak for themselves.",

    "text": "I have always loved Giada as a chef, so when I found out she was opening up her first restaurant here in Vegas I knew exactly where I would be spending my money!! I was a little disappointed with how long my Friend and I had to wait to be seated even after they had told us how long it would be ( We waited an extra 25mins after the fact ) which for a more upscale restaurant I would expect better. Other then that we ordered a few appetizers that were good, I liked that she had her own twist on certain classics like the \"Rosted eggplant parmigiana\". Then we ordered a few main courses; Barolo braised Australian Wagyu beef short ribs, and Rigatoni. The short ribs where phenomenal! Probably my favorite dish, the meat melts in your mouth, it's amazing! The Rigatoni was great too, the pasta was a little too al dente but the Bolognese was full of so much flavor, you would never know there wasn't meat in it. We finished off the night with a chocolate cake ( I forgot the name lol ) and cappuccinos! I'm not going to lie the cake was a little dry I didn't even finish it...    I will say the decor is absolutely breath taking and very grand, she hit the nail on the head with really portraying her style. I love the location on the strip it's perfect. Everything had Giada's name on it which is cute and I loved it! Our waitress was awesome she new everything on the menu and took the time to answer any questions we had, giving us great recommendations on menu items like the short ribs. Since it is a upscale restaurant the proportions are small and the prices not so much. Over all I will still return to Giada's again, there where a lot of other things we tried that I did love! The food for the most part was perfect, and very creative with fresh twist to classic Italian dishes.",

He was a gentleman from Italy.  By the end of our dinner we were showing our server photos of our dogs and he was telling us about his.  He was so genuine and is a True asset to Giada.  He presented us with an ipad that had the drink menu.  Off of this we ordered wine which was good.  We ordered two types of cured meat before our entree's.  I had the beef wagyu which was good!  For my entree I had the crab and scallop rissotto.  While the plate overall was small, the scallops had absolutely outstanding flavor.  We had the molton chocolate cake for dessert which is made from scratch and takes 20 minutes to prepare.  I also had a espresso alcoholic dessert drink which was quite delcious.  My bill alone was $90.  The price is a bit high for what you get as the portions are small but the dining experience is one that I definitely won't forget.  The photobooth was so much fun after dinner as well!  A nice souvenir!",

The oysters were decent. The crab legs were good. The lobster salad thing was good.  I really wanted more.  The way to go is order the $86. tower for yourself if you find you have extra money  and a decent seafood loving appetite.",

The peppers were more raw than cooked, which was fine for me. My dinner partner would have preferred them more cooked. The arugula salad- yeah, just get it. The vinaigrette made the salad. Many of the pastas were available gluten free, so that's what we got. I have never had such an incredibly spicy pasta. Like it was almost inedible spicy for some. I liked it but would have been better at 50% less spicy. Broccolini was fine but a tad overcharred.   Wish I had had room for dessert!",

    "text": "DINNER:  My husband and I did a weekend getaway to Las Vegas,to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary,& had dinner at Giada at The Cromwell. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!! She is my favorite Food Network chef,& rightfully so! We made a reservation a few weeks in advance. Not sure if that is necessary, but we wanted a specific time & date, also to coordinate around our show tickets.  The decor of her restaurant is just STUNNING! The detail of her motto written into the lighting fixtures was really cool!! Already we were impressed! The bread plate that they brought out was AMAZING! Warm, in its own little crock, with different dippings to try. And different bread sticks.The sample plate that my husband got, was a large variety of small bites, just FANTASTIC!!  I got the Bucatini pasta cooked perfectly & the sauce was SPECTACULAR!! The creative cocktail list is interesting & my husband got a basil drink that was OUTSTANDING! They knew from the OpenTable reservation that it was our anniversary and brought out two different cookies on a dish with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce. We ordered the Orange mocha flavored coffee to go with it,& it was an AMAZING and CREATIVE twist on how coffee should always be served! We will definitely be going back!!  The bill came & was totally more than reasonable for the high quality of food & service we received.  GIADA- if you read this -PLEASE OPEN A RESTAURANT IN LOS ANGELES!!!!   BRUNCH: Its one year later,& we decided to try Brunch at Giada this Vegas visit. IT WAS SPECTACULAR!! As stated in my earlier review, she is my favorite chef. We started by ordering mimosa's, made with fresh squeezed OJ. My husband decided on the tasting menu. His choices were chicken and waffles cacciatore style,a sweet and savory delight. First course was a creative take on a blueberry muffin, and antipasto. Then the chicken and waffles then a dessert consisting of the best raspberry sorbet/ gelato sandwiched between two lemon glazed soft cookies. PHENOMENAL!! I chose to get the Breakfast Contadina, which was 2 poached eggs, polenta cakes, wilted spinach and roasted tomato. Along the side came fresh toasted thick bread and a tray of 3 different spreads: raspberry, lemon butter, and a Nutella style spread. See the photos! Fantastic service, great view of the strip, great food,& the happiness of being there. It was the best way to start the day. I highly recommend trying Giada's Restaurant if you haven't had the experience yet. I hope to meet her on another visit!!!",

    "text": "A year ago I had my pre-birthday dinner here. Giada's is housed in the luxurious Cromwell Hotel, on a very nice elevator accessed upper floor. Unfortunately I got way too buzzed on two bottles of excellent Sicilian Wine to write my review at the time. And besides, who wants the birthday boy's face stuffed into a cellphone writing a review during the birthday dinner. So I am writing it now.  Through my haze here is what I recall. The wine selection was exceptional and fairly priced. The restaurant was beautiful and the staff was great. And the menu was really exciting.   We ordered fried calamari (a must for my girlfriend at any establishment that offer it no matter how upscale); then that was followed by a prima piatti of penne (or was it orccietta) in red sauce; then followed by a rack of lamb in herbs. We split everything.   Here is the issue why this place is not getting 4 stars from me if not 5. Everything was way too salty. That's it. The food was great... but too salty. If food is too salty, then it isn't right. And this is an easy fix. Salt it lightly and then let the guest use cheese to salt it, or even simply sprinkle some salt on it. Pasta with red sauce should be salted lightly, because everyone grates cheese on it, and Romano is essentially nothing but milk and a lot of salt.  If Giada herself were in the kitchen this wouldn't have happened. But she was not in the kitchen.  On a really good note - I repeat, the wine was great, and after dinner we had dessert and cappuccinos and both were perfect.",

I blame the ever-flowing booze whilst gambling on this fact, because, Giada is not forgettable whatsoever.   We had a client dinner here in early 2015. From the moment we were seated, I was in love. The interior is gorgeous, warm and modern. The view with the floor-to-ceiling windows is one of the best in Vegas. The service was beyond fantastic - attentive, there when you wanted it, helpful, not pushy.  But, the best?   The food.  I'm not a Giada fan. I don't really watch her show unless it just happens to come on after something else. We tried a number of dishes; from the bacon-wrapped dates, charred octopus and burrata, to most of the salumnis plus shared pasta dishes and, of course, main dishes (ranging from the salmon to the surf and turf to the rack of lamb.) No one was disappointed.  I cannot wait to visit and try the brunch menu and mimosas.",

Everything was really fresh and tasted like it was homemade which was nice bc you don't often taste that. Our waiter, Fred, was very nice and attentive but not too much, he knew how to work the table just enough. We started w the dates, meatballs, burrata, and bread to start. The dates were huge compared to other places we've been that have bacon wrapped dates and had a nice flavor; the meatballs tasted fresh from the kitchen; the burrata was a large portion considering it didn't come w anything and was meant to go w the bread. The bread I thought was kind of strange, it was like a large herbed/salted/oiled roll w a few of those hard crackers some places have. It was good but very rich and all the starters we had were so rich that I said to my husband that it would've been nice to have a nice piece of like plain Italian bread to cut the richness. I prob wouldn't order the burrata again if we return bc it didn't have much flavor compared to other places I've had it and it didn't really work w the bread. We also shared a Bellisimo cocktail, I think that's the name. It was fantastic, it tasted like summer in a glass- strawberries and ice, I didn't taste the alcohol and didn't realize how quick I was drinking it! After that we had the pasta course, my husband the lobster ravioli, myself the signature spaghetti. Both were very good, although my husband's had a little too much sauce and mine not enough, still tasty though! I couldn't finish mine at all hoping to have room for the main course. I had the rack of lamb and my husband the 7oz filet. Both were cooked perfectly. Sadly I had a couple bites and had to stop. Fred kindly boxed it up for me and told me he was proud for the effort lol. I couldn't even get dessert. My husband got an orange and chocolate espresso though that smelled nice and because it was his birthday the restaurant brought him some signature cookies on a plate that said \"happy birthday\". Overall I think it was nice time had by all.  Oh side note, this is not food related but we wondered if everything was breaking at the Cromwell. The elevator in the garage didn't work, neither did the escalator to the restaurant, and the restaurant itself was so hot we regretted being dressed! We didn't know if it was bc temps are up this week in Vegas or if the AC was out but we felt for the waitstaff in full suits.",

First of all the restaurant is in the Cromwell hotel.   That hotel has been fully remodeled and its lovely.    This restaurant is a large open space, it is very inviting.  It has soft lighting, beautiful accessories, and for such a large space it was remarkably quiet.   The place has extra large windows and it was such a lovely evening that they opened this huge swing out bay of them at the main part of the restaurant.  Man that was so nice! I love it!   There courses are small, but very filling.   The appetizer list has some amazing choices, like the chicken meatballs, yummy!   The wine list is large, but as I usually complain about the wine list, the prices were a bit much for me.   A 24.00 glass of wine for a Napa Cab, that I could have bought in the store for 8.00 a bottle.   So there I said it! :)   But the food was amazing!  The pasta is all made in house, so its rich and dense and the boys all said it was great.  I had the salmon which was served on a large rich slice of beet, and some amazing sauce drizzled on the side.     We had such a nice time here.   The atmosphere was stylish but light.   The service was FANTASTIC!  Its nice to see that in a world where everyone is in a hurry, and no one seems to care about anyone but themselves.   I think you should try this place.  It was worth every penny.",

    "text": "Celebrated Christmas dinner last night with family in town from Maui.  The cold greeting by the hostess ladies was not warm or friendly. Waited 10 minutes to be seated with the rest of our party that was already seated but the hostess ladies mostly ignored us so we just walked in and found our table ourselves.  Our waiter who I wish I could remember his name was fantastic and friendly.   We were a party of 6 so we were told our party had to be seated in a room in the back with four other large round tables.  This didn't give us the ambiance we desired but the boys were happy with the laker game.  No table cloths were on the tables which wobbled our glasses around and the wood kept snagging the sequins off my now ruined dress. I was stuck in between the seam of two wood pieces.   I started with the Giada signature cocktail. It had a floral taste that I did not enjoy. We then munched on a platter of Salumi and cheeses which were awesome and the kids ordered a pizette with spinach.  Next my group ordered and I tasted the Pappardelle, Rack of lamb, Braised short rib, Bucatini, Salmon and  the clear winner was the simple but delicious house made spaghetti with gigantic lemon basil shrimp.  The salmon was the biggest disappointment. I'm going to compare fish cooked at Mamas Fish House on Maui to this salmon. Mamas is always moist and delicious. The salmon was dry, thin and not flavorful. If we're paying $40-50 for each portion of food I want to at least walk away saying \"Wow that's a great bite\".  The waiter was fabulous by recommending the spaghetti that he said was the best seller and it was fantastic.  I do recommend to try the pasta dishes here and avoid the mains. The rest of the meat dishes were just okay but the pasta dishes were the best.  For dessert it was a toasted banana gelato that stole the show over her favorite cookies, tiramisu which our waiter scrounged in the kitchen for us even though it wasn't on the menu (what a great guy!!!!), and the strawberry sorbet.   I so wanted to fall in love but I walk out with a \"it was just ok\".",

Tried the orzo meatballs and a pizette -yum! The hostess and server were very professional and hospitable. Loved the complimentary birthday cookies- chocolate and lemon; wouldn't necessarily think they go together but they did compliment each other. Hope it's not another two years until I get to dine with you again!",

Our bartender Max was so sweet and the second we sat down we had menus in our hands and he made excellent reccomendations on getting started with an Apertif. Once seated at our lovely table with a view, we started with the Orzo meatballs which were savory and delicious, highly reccomend. My husband ordered the Surf and Turf and it was cooked to perfection. I ordered the lemon spaghetti with prawns and it was delicious! The limoncello souffle was the perfect way to end the meal.

But it's followed up by dishes that are no more tasteful than a regular Italian restaurant. I felt let down by my dining experience there after hearing the hype. But yea just that,  hype. The server will try to sell you on a tasting course that is presented in an envelope with a giant picture of Giada... Like we get it,  it's her restaurant. Even after I ordered the waiter tried to push it on me again and left it at the table like a car salesman. Strange.  I'm willing to give it another try, but was disappointed overall.",

I do have celiac and very careful where I eat and noticed the menu did have some options for me. We were there for breakfast as most places usually have more options then lunch or dinner. I was surprised to see I could not have eggs and potatoes as a gluten free option. I was informed the potato's had wheat flour in the mixture, which really surprised me as to why? So my only option was the frittata which is one on my favorite breakfast items, but again with no potatoes or other options (ie fruit, sliced tomatoes ect..) and the prosciutto was extra. I have been making frittata's for some time and when in Italy it's my go to dish even for dinner, but I was sadden to experience this dish as the egg was over cooked making the egg dry and somewhat burnt. The Bellini was wonderful and the atmosphere was great the reason for the good rating, I hope to try again and maybe experience something better as I enjoy the dishes she puts together. So if you are gluten free the only option for breakfast is the frittata.",

Chicken Marsala meatballs- good. Caprese - so tastesless. The service - TERRIBLE! No explanation or details given to tasting menu or regular menu. I honestly thought the tasting menu was a bizarre souvenir - it contained three recipe cards, an autographed picture of Giada and a specific 4 course meal with no pricing.  Everything took forever...even water . Dishes with butter and olive oil for bread were chipped and broken. We finally asked for a different server. He made a very good effort to finish the meal but I would never go back!",

The bar is packed, even at 10pm which they also advised in advance. Found a spot on the end. Two bartenders helped us, Robert and Chris I think. Both gave awesome service & so personable. We enjoyed our cocktails very much!   We got a window table which I was very excited about. The view of Ceasars Palace :) It took a while to get menus. Our server, Jessie I think it was. Female with dark hair brought the wine list first. Everything on the menu looked amazing but my stomach couldnt handle one of each thing. We ordered the Chicken Marsala Meatballs to start. Amazing! VERY small order so dont be surprised. I think there were only 4 bite size pieces. We didnt get the complimentary bread before the appetizer so I had to ask for it. Presentation was impressive. I enjoyed the lemon butter with the Rosemary Olive Oil bread. We were brought St. Germain compliments of Giada. That was a nice touch & it was good! Not too floral. I enjoyed just sipping on it. We ordered Iced Tea's with the Raspberry Essence the same time we ordered the app and entrees and didnt get it until we were in the middle of our entree's after I asked for it. Instead of an apology, our server quickly left the table and yelled at her busser. The Iced Tea service is very impressive I must say. Comes with a glass straw! One order comes with two full glasses and are not refillable. I had the famous Spaghetti which was delish! Those prawns are huge! The boyfriend had the Salmon with succotash, yummy!!!! And a side of lemon potatoes. Never in my mind would think to put those two together but it just worked. We were both getting full but I was not about to pass up dessert because I really wanted gelato! The beautiful dessert cart came by & of course everything looked wonderful but I already planned on getting gelato so we got one of each flavor, White Coffee & Toasted Banana. OMG! Best gelato ever! Both were amazing, I dont know which one I enjoyed more. The server brings the check & it comes with an Itouch servey. The bf fills it out cause we def had comments to make! When she comes back from swiping the card she then mentions our anniversary. Kinda late dont you think! As we were standing up she brings an anniversary drink. It was a basil infused sparkling lemonade. A lil sour & too sweet for me but good. I wish she brought that before we were leaving cause I had to sit back down to drink it.   Avi was the front manager for the night & as we were first getting seated he introduced himself. During our meal he came by again to shake both our hands & asked if everything was ok. I wanted to mention all the things our server missed but he came by when I had a mouth full of food. He was very nice & im impressed he went to every table & introduced himself. That is quality service.  The service from our server only could have been better but I will definitley be back. The food is just outstanding. Im a fan of her show & Giada is my favorite Food Network star so of course I was excited she opened a restaurant here. I can def see her personality in the design of the room. Its large, so open & clean.",

The food was high quality and delicious. However, it was not exceptional for a fine dining restaurant.    The grilled octopus was good and I ate all of it but it was chewier than it needed it to be. The fried calamari was good but not memorable. The sauce that came with the fried calamari was excellent, hats off to the saucier. The lemon spaghetti was done well. It was good food that I would expect from this type of restaurant but nothing earth shattering.  The service was exceptional. Very approachable highly trained well informed staff-everyone from the server to the managers. The hostesses could use a touch more work shining up with work flow but even they were more than adequate.  I look forward to eating here again.",

Ordered the following:  ANTIPASTI (shared amongst 4)  - Bacon wrapped dates - Orzo meatballs - Lobster Arancini - Prosciutto - Burrata  The orzo meatballs were probably my favorite. Lobster arancini was good, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. And finally, for someone who doesn't like dates, the bacon wrapped dates were on point. Prosciutto and Burrata of very good quality.  Main (shared between 2)  - Spaghetti (shrimp, lemon, basil) - Risotto with (crab and scallops) - Side of Sweet corn and spicy sausage  I had the spaghetti which I really enjoyed. The sauce is very light, but just the perfect amount of flavor to be able to really enjoy the fresh pasta. Side of sweet corn and spicy sausage was a bit spicy, but very good.  Overall, this was a very memorable dinner, from the environment, to the service, the food, and of course the dessert cart! Don't forget to stop by the photobooth by the host table.",

    "text": "My parents moved to the United States from Rome in 1985, so I was very much looking forward to eating at Giada's new restaurant in Las Vegas.   I enjoyed everything I ate; however, there were several textural issues, and salt issues with my plates.   I began my lunch with the Burrata appetizer. Burrata (from burro, the Italian word for butter) is an extremely creamy cheese that can be pulled apart with a fork, and is often spread on bread. The Burrata was excellent, drizzled with olive oil, and served with a line of salt on the plate. Unfortunately, Giada's house bread is akin to pita bread, it consists of their pizza dough undercooked, and is served with a small ramekin of pesto, which was almost inedibly salty. Burrata really needs to be spread on hearty, crunchy bread otherwise every bite is devoid of any texture but mushiness.   My second appetizer consisted of baby peppers stuffed with goat cheese. They were delicious; sweet, and creamy.   For my entree I had the infamous $35 lobster roll. Again, this plate suffered from salt, and textural issues. The lobster roll consisted of one thick piece of Italian bread with a heaping pile of the lobster-centric filling on top. I tasted NO salt in the filling; however, that's an easy fix as you can always add salt. After the addition of some salt it was delicious. The filling was mostly large lumps of succulent lobster with capers, and celery bits; it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the dish was not a roll, it had to be eaten with utensils, and would not even qualify as an open faced sandwich as there was significantly more filling than bread. The real problem though was that the Italian bread bottom was soggy because in a matter of seconds it had absorbed the moisture from the lobster filling. Once agin during my meal I was taking spongy bites; this time of soggy bread, and lobster filling.   In conclusion, the issues I had were minor. However, with NO alcohol my lunch cost around $80 with tip. For this amount of money I do not think that crisp bread is too much to ask for. I would definitely return again for lunch though.",

We somehow managed to get a reservation the same day that we called, so we were able to have a nice, late dinner.  They had a great drink selection, with signature cocktails, craft beers and some amazing wines. To start, I got a beer.  For appetizers, we had bread and burrata. The bread was amazing and freshly baked in a small cast iron skillet. The burrata was creamy and came with a balsamic sea salt. It melted in your mouth, the way burrata should.  Since our reservation was so late, we had already eaten a bit, so were not terribly hungry. I wish I was, because the tasting menu (I think it had 3 or 4 courses) looked amazing.  Instead, my sister got the spaghetti, which she loved. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. Our extremely picky friend ordered the spaghetti, but he wanted it with a red sauce. And he loved it, so much so that he ordered a plate to go as well. Since it was a special request, I anticipated some push back from our server, but there was none.  I ordered the risotto, which was rich and creamy and had an amazing crab flavor (as well as crab chunks). The scallops on top were perfectly cooked.   To finish off the meal, we had an amazing dessert with mascarpone or ricotta and topped with an amazing strawberry jam. I wish I remember what exactly it was. It was amazing, and we ordered two more desserts to go.   Overall, an amazing dining experience. The decor was amazing. The service was amazing. And the food was amazing.

    "text": "I had really high hopes and expectations for this restaurant, not because of Giada's celebrity status, but having been a fan of her on FN for years, and having used her recipes hundreds of times, I know this woman is legit. And the experience, from start to finish, did not disappoint. The restaurant decor is exactly what you'd imagine Giada's restaurant to look like. It's beautiful. The view is beautiful, the dining area is beautiful, the bar, ditto.   The one odd thing about the night were the number of hostesses huddled around the front of the restaurant. I know it gets busy so when one leaves to escort diners to their table, another takes over, but it was a little mob-like. Anyway, that is honestly the only off thing I felt the entire night.   The service was absolutely wonderful. Our server, Jeff, could not have been more perfect. The right balance of informative and helpful without being over bearing. He suggested a sampler to start. On our plate, we had the dates, bruschetta, and peppers. The bruschetta was yummy. The peppers were so fresh, it was as if they were freshly picked from a farmer's market that day. The dates were out of this world!   My BF ordered the lobster ravioli for dinner. The ravioli were generally stuffed with delicately spiced lobster. I think he ate the entire plate in less than three minutes. Seriously, it was that good.   I ordered the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. This is honestly the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. The pasta, so fresh. The lemon sauce is absolutely divine. And the sprinkle of fried capers on top, perfection.   The wine list was nice, not crazy big. They had lots of options for wine by the glass. The pours themselves, I thought, were on the large side and that's a GREAT thing.  Giada was everything I expected it to be. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend!   Tip: if you want to try your hand at making the lemon spaghetti, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodandwine.com&s=865d3cf8084539054d36ae6a1f45804f2b3bd596a7d0523414e8c5599ab0a68a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodandwine.com</a> has Giada's recipe. Everything down to the fried capers. I made the dish two nights after dining at Giada's and, but for not having fresh pasta (still working on that), the recipe is spot on for what you get in the restaurant. It was really, really good. In fact, I'm making it again tonight :)",

It's like you're eating out of her cookbooks, and it's pretty good. Better, seems like a reflection of her personality: honest, easy-going, but pays attention to detail and wants something a little better than ordinary. Also, she uses very good ingredients - especially on the charcuterie plate, which I recommend late at night - which are noticeably fresh and well-sourced.  Good all around.",

The four of us were looking forward to Giadas new restaurant because like most of the reviewers, Giada is so inviting on her food network show.  Starting with the miniature bread - no flavor, lack of salt but he 4 side spoons of kosher salt, red pepper flakes, and pesto sauce was a nice touch. The Caesar salad was swimming in sweet lemon capers - I ordered dressing in the side but the lettuce was over powered by capers. Orzo meatballs were flavorless and had more orzo than meat. No salt or garlic flavor. Marqarita pizza had limited, mostly dough and no flavor-thankfully I used red pepper flakes  to rescue. The chicken cacciatore for two( served on one plate and had to ask for a second plate) was fried chicken ( oops - bakes and flash fried ) had no flavor and a small bowel of tomatoes and peppers. Nothing traditional . The broccolini was inedible since it was drenched in lemon - could not taste the vegetable. The veal shank - was another breaded /fried fish with no flavor. We expected more from someone who boasts her Italian heritage . I don't think she knows how to cook",

    "text": "I love watching Giada & have heard good things from other ppl who have enjoyed meals here. So when my friends said they'd like to do dinner here during our girls' weekend, I was all in! Sadly, the experience did not live up to expectations. The service was atrocious for a restaurant of this caliber.  Since our table for 6 was still being turned over when we arrived, they suggested we have a drink at the bar while we waited. It took the bar wait staff 10 min to acknowledge we were there, another 10 for a server to come to say she'd bring bar menus & clean up the table. So after menus arrived & we had a chance to give it a quick glance, our drink order did not get put in until about 30 min after arrival. About 40 min after arrival, the hostess came back to take us to our table, so we let her know our drinks hadn't arrived & requested to have them sent to our table. She told us she needed to check since they usually close the bar tab before seating. After checking & coming back seeming inconvenienced, she took us to our table & left us there saying our server would be right with us. No food/drink menus were left with us or water offered. Strike 1! It took another 15 min for the server to arrive who introduced himself & said he'd bring our drinks from the bar when they were ready. He was turning to walk away when one of us quickly stopped him to request that water & menus be brought to the table on his return since he did not offer water or ask if we needed anything before turning away. Strike 2!  This basically set the tone for the rest of the meal. There were huge periods in between water, drinks, or food courses where our server was nowhere in sight & other staff zoomed by us without a second glance. At some point a full drink was accidentally tipped over. We could not get any staff to assist in a timely manner (the 3 or 4 staff who passed by did not attempt to stop to help & just said they'd get our waiter), so we used our own table napkins to clean up the spill off the floor. When our waiter finally came around, he seemed indifferent about the spill since we had already wiped it up, didn't offer a replacement drink nor did he offer to bring new table napkins to replace the ones balled up on the floor. Strike 3!  Side note on the food, it was good but not truly memorable. I had the crab & scallop risotto, which I enjoyed but did not blow me away. The pizzettes seemed to be enjoyed by those who ordered them as well as the spaghetti dish. They did bring a birthday cookie plate for our friend who had a  bday coming up & the glazed lemon cookie was probably the most memorable item of the night. Yummy!  All in all, with all the other fine dining options on the Vegas strip I don't see myself returning based on the service alone. So sad since I love watching Giada's shows.   Quick tip: hit up the free photo booth at the entrance - one of the only high points of the evening.",

But bar seating was on a first come first serve basis so I waited for approx. 10 minutes. My girlfriend and I were there for brunch so there was only one pasta listed on the menu (darn). I ordered the Salmon Cake Benedict. I love anything seafood and eggs Benedict so this was a win-win for me. My friend is not a seafood person and she said it was \"too fishy\" but I can assure you it was not-- it was amazing! The bartender was attentive and friendly. We also ordered a Sangria each. He said he didn't have red anymore so we opt for white. It wasn't the best but it wasn't too bad either. Overall, the food and service at Giada's exceeded my expectations.",

When we arrived up to the top where the hostess was, it was an odd arrangement.  We saw tshirts folded on the shelves so we weren't sure if it was a clothing shop or a restaurant.  It was an odd setup.  While we waited for them to setup our table we took full advantage of the photobooth.  It was out of paper, but we emailed it to ourselves.  The decor is modern and sleek and dimly lit to be sexy.  The large ring shaped lights hanging from the ceiling reminded me of Lord of the Rings.  They say something like, \"I love to eat a lot of Anything.  I eat a little bit of everything\"  I guess it's her slogan?   Service was great and we had a variety of appetizers and the main courses were small enough so we weren't over stuffed when we left.  However for the price and the atmosphere, it's not worth it.  It was the most expensive meal during our stay and we went to several reservation required establishments.    The food wasn't memorable.",

I loved the furnishings and decor. It felt like we were in Giada's extra large sitting/dining room.  Took awhile for dishes to come out after ordering (maybe 30 min).   Ordered the Sunrise Polenta Waffle. The sunny side eggs and waffle were speckled with pancetta and chives, but they were quite flavorless without syrup.The bechamel sauce added nothing flavor or texture wise. Felt a little sick after eating this because I literally had to drench everything in syrup to flavor it.   Tried my companion's blueberry muffin. It was grainy and tasted nutritious. Not my favorite muffin, but better than the waffle. Also tried a bit of the lemon cookie and chocolate cookie. The lemon cookie was too sweet. The chocolate cookie had a nice dark chocolate after taste, but I wouldn't pay money for it.   The plating for everything was lovely. The service was attentive, really loved our waitress Erin. However despite the beauty of this place, the food isn't worth the price or the calories.",

The prices were outrageous!!  The food was horrible!!  The service was forgettable!!  Don't waste your time or money",

Definitely 5-star worthy there.  Where it starts to go downhill right off the bat is the service. SLOOOOOW. And not friendly or knowledgeable. I know it's supposed to be a slow Italian dinner reminiscent of the old country, but our server was really nowhere to be found on several occasions for long periods of time. Not helpful when you've dropped your fork on the ground and need a replacement while your food sits and gets cold.   The food itself was good, but of course, the portions are small and very highly priced, which wasn't a surprise....just don't go there when you're ravenous.You'll leave ravenous.  We had a party of four and were able to taste test each others meals. Nothing that blew our skirts up, but it was definitely worth trying. My husband and I had the Pesto Pea Tortellini and Bucatini Pomodoro. Finished off with a cute Hazelnut Espresso.   Three stars is all I could muster. Will not be returning, but glad we tried it.",

But the best was the roll around cart where you build your own brownie dessert - for only $5.  Overall the food was awesome. Fun specially drinks. And a great ambiance. Can't wait to try it again on our next trip to Vegas!",

We ordered plenty of food a good variety as well and definitely weren't disappointed!   Ended with ricotta cookies and they melt in your mouth!  I highly highly recommend trying this place out.

If I even considered dropping a star it would be for a the small menu selection, but everything I tasted looked and tasted outstanding.   I had the Sunrise Polenta waffle (a must try). Crispy waffle, with slightly savory taste and served with house infused syrup and beschamel. My wife had the salmon eggs benedict. Both were filling and so flavorful. My wife also had the Dolce Vita, a great breakfast cocktail with elderflower.   Our server/barmistress, Molly was bright, cheery and made recommended all the dishes we had. 100 points for knowing the menu, and great service.   They had these comfy seating, too and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.",

I would have preferred to choose my own appetizer vs the tasting menu which offers an anti-pasti platter to share but they decide what comes on it. Its hit or miss. Ours came with bacon wrapped dates which I would never have ordered for myself and I didn't really like it.  The filet I got was the tiniest steak I have ever seen in my life. Not that I was expecting a 10oz portion but still. My wife had the chicken ciacciatori style and only ate half. She didn't seem overly impressed by it.  Service was excellent.

    "text": "Fair warning this review is about customer service:  Being an avid foodie... I was so excited to have purchased a groupon for Giada -44$ voucher for 65$ breakfast, dinner or lunch for two with complimentary champagne. I am a huge food network fan- and this venue was on top of my list of places to visit in Vegas-so purchasing a groupon was a great idea.  Located on the second floor of the Cromwell, the exterior entrance of the restaurant is beautiful!  My colleague canceled on me due to a medical emergency. So with 2 days left for the groupon expiry, I decided to head for dinner here alone. Upon making a reservation in advance, I was told by the manager at Giada that the voucher could not be used if there was no second person. Am I really going to eat 65$ worth of food? Reality check , probably not. There was no attempt to make up for customer service, or even try to work out an alternative! Lastly, no apology! But she said  I can dine at Giada without the voucher..IF I WANT to. Why would I dine at a restaurant when I have already prepurchased a voucher? Name me one person who will have an appetite after this quality of service.   It's too bad -these celebrity chefs should be aware of the poor management that goes on with their business -especially considering this is Giada first resto in Vegas! I have been to many other food network restaurants- this venue is by far the worst rated in service-especially lack of accommodating clients that will actually spend money on food. I politely left and said I would deal with the matter with Groupon.   Too bad and no thank you, I am very content as a foodie to try out restaurants that actually care about their clients enjoying their fine dining experience! the restaurant manager, not the servers (who were great Btw) has a lot to work on if they want to earn a better reputation on the strip!",

The lobster ravioli is normally delicious but tonight it was too sweet. Not sure why they added sugar to the sauce. It would have been better just with butter and lemon. Also the bar tender must be new. The signature cocktail, the serpico, is usually amazing. Today it tasted like a cheap Long Island iced tea. Also it took 20 minutes to get bread. Definitely get the crispy Brussels sprouts. That was the best. I'm sure I'll be back, but today was pretty disappointing.",

Fast forward through a turbulent dinner when the place first opened up and \"Bam\" you have a four star wonderful review.   The bartender was super attentive and brought some fun drinks out for my birthday lunch. I told him I like tart and refreshing drink and he got creative!

The flavors were magnificent and drinks were great!  I started with Oyster Crudo which was just a really refreshing dish. The fresh oysters here you will love if that's your thing. A bit on the pricey side if your trying to budget but you're in Vegas so no need for that. I followed that up with a romaine salad. Tasty and crisp. Exactly what you want in a salad!   For my main course I had the lam chops and lemon potato. (could be wrong on the name of the potato) Best lamb I've ever had in my life. Melt in your mouth with a beautiful succulent array of flavors. I wanted to order three more chops but figured I should pace myself. If you like lamb or want to try it for the first time do it! You will not be disappointed!  The only \"bad\" part of the service was the server was a bit slow but they were busy so no big deal. Also wish Giada was there but maybe next time I can only hope and pray lol. ",

    "text": "I normally don't do something like this but our experience at Giada's was so disappointing  We were there on Sat evening July 6th to celebrate my granddaughters' 21st Birthday  We had 7:30 reservations & were seated without 2 of our guest. To start out our waiter was extremely rude. Our guest arrive at 8:30 because of traffic on the Strip. When I asked our waiter for menus & place settings for our guest he approached the manager. The manager came over to our table & said they could not be served because they needed  the table. The table next to us was empty & we had already ordered our desert. He proceeded to ask us to move into the lobby with our desert. I was never so embarrassed. We continued to discuss the situation but after ruining my granddaughters' dinner we just walked out. I will never go back to a Giada Establishment again. I have never been so embarrassed in all my life",

    "text": "I took my mom and grandma here because they love tv personalities but their taste in food is pretty questionable. Giada was supposed to be a sort of compromise so we didn't have to go to the Guy Fieri restaurant.   We came for lunch on a Sunday and the space is beautiful, we were able to make a reservation day of- though the place was mostly empty, and they had a yelp check in offer... but unfortunately that only made things awkward as the server then made sure to sort of pester us about writing a 5-star review and then mentioning him but then seemed to give about 65% effort in actually earning that rating as our waters remained empty for most of the meal and our dessert took about 35 minutes and was basically stale cookies.   We each got one of their boozy juice drinks. Mine was good, my mom's lemonade strawberry something was wayyyyy too sweet.   I got a salad because I wasn't super hungry. It had kale, faro, and some other healthy stuff but overall was just fine. My grandma got yogurt bc that's basically all she likes to eat bc she's obsessed with eating healthy even though she probably weighs 75 lbs. My mom got the pre-fixe lunch, which was 3 courses and a dessert. I tried a bit of everything and was super underwhelmed. Her pasta was room temperature at best and nothing was really a standout beyond the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the photo booth you can take a picture with at the entrance.   Maybe they're better for dinner but for what we had I was glad I didn't bother with putting on make-up or effort for the day because it was not meal worth a lot of to-do.",

    "text": "I WAS Excited to be Finally Going Here...   I have been wanting to go to this restaurant since it opened but was never able to get a reservation. This time I planned in advance.  The place is beautiful! And, I had a nice window view of the strip.  The hostess was friendly as she chatted with me as I walked through the place.    The server introduced himself and gave me the menu. Later his assistant/ busser introduced himself and asked if I had questions. I did... he vaguely answered my first and then walked away.   The options here are good with portions on the smaller size.  I was craving some pasta with a steak. They said no pasta sides or half orders were available. So I switched to pasta as an entree with a very small pizza (perfect for me) and a salad.  They then swooped in with a bread board with lots of accompaniments (if I'd known that was coming I probably wouldn't have gotten a different appetizer).  The focaccia was fantastic!  The Romain salad was good too.  At first I thought it was underdressed but as I continued to eat... I found it perfect.  Good so far... the pizza was satisfactory but I found the crust underwhelming.  Again, it was the perfect size as an appetizer.   The pasta dish though was not good.  I ordered fettuccini with lobster, bacon and a lite tomato-cream sauce.  The fettuccine pasta was fresh (not dried). The sauce, however, was smoked... and I mean SMOKED. So much so, I couldn't taste the morsels of lobster and never saw any bacon.  I ate about half and could do anymore... even though I did want something more.  I left before dessert.  Service here was good... my server was very attentive.  Food: underwhelming especially for the price.  So, now I've tried Giada, on to other places.",

    "text": "Our Open Table reservation was honored an we were promptly seated by a window overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains.  However why look outside when the inside of Giada's restaurant was so attractive and decorated in the classiest of ways.  We chose the Prix Fix menu, my wife choosing the salmon filet and I, the tomahawk pork chop.  Both were excellent.  Side dishes were a bit skimpy, but delicious. We were given a very small portion of rigatoni mushroom pasta that was also delicious, but you needed an electron microscope to see it.  Seriously, it was served in a big white dish with a small bowl center that contained about one cup of pasta. (Just one to share!) LOL!  The little desserts, (selected from a rolling dessert cart), were awesome as we could choose three each between the two of us.  Our server, Rocko, (from Italy), was undoubtedly the most helpful, knowledgeable, and nicest gentlemen we have had the pleasure of meeting.  You will truly be lucky if he is your server!  He seriously did everything to make us happy.  Giada's is not your bargain-basement restaurant.  It is classical fine dining, so don't be surprised at the bill. I believe our prix fix selections came to approx. $85/each.  Add pre-dinner cocktails plus beer and wine added to the tab and we were well over $200 for the two of us.  Rocko was so good he received a 25% tip!   We highly recommend Giada's, (AND ROCKO)!    P.S. - We liked it so much, we came back three nights later with the rest of our family.  Rocko's wing-man, Vincenzo (Vinny), took care of us and did an equally fantastic job.  Don't ask what the bill was!   We'll be back!",

The decor and placement of tables were great. We were lucky to get a table overlooking Bellagio and it was awesome to since it was at nighttime.   You can either order a pre arranged 4 meal dinner or get the different options you want individually.   We ordered a platter from the antipasti that had orzo meatballs, sweet peppers, marinated olives, and bacon wrapped dates. Their orzo meatballs had really great flavor. I also really liked their bacon wrapped dates but then again everything is awesome wrapped in bacon. The olives had amazing flavors.   I ordered spaghetti and some kind of meat sauce. It was the most incredible spaghetti I've ever had! Thick spaghetti with lots of awesome flavor. The meat sauce was also really good with some spicyness to it but not hot.   As the main dish I tried their rack of lamb. Very good, just enough seasoning yet still lots of lamb flavor.   We sadly didn't have any room for dessert of all this. This was the most amazing dining experience I've had, the service was superb and every detail was perfect. This is the only restaurant I've been to where they let you use an iPad to look over pictures of their dishes, how cool is that!  This place is quite popular, if you have a big party it's advisable to book at least several weeks in advance.",

We arrived at 11am, were seated at a beautiful table with a fantastic view, asked about breakfast and were told they stopped serving breakfast 10 minutes ago.  First of all, the restaurant was not busy at all. They couldn't have made the tiniest exception for us and handed us a breakfast menu? We probably should have asked to see a manager but we were too shocked.  Second of all, Giada management hello... this is LAS VEGAS. We checked out of our room at The Cromwell at 11am (normal check out time) and walked right over to your restaurant, literally steps away. Why don't you at the very least extend breakfast until 11:30am to accommodate Cromwell guests who check out at 11am and would like to enjoy breakfast at Giada before starting their day?  Seriously poor service in our opinion. We won't be going back.",

It took a solid 10-15 minutes before a waiter came over, negative. Service was kind of slow from there on out. I didn't realize until the waiter told us that most of the items on the menu are designed for \"tasting\" which basically means all the portions are small as hell. My husband joked that's how Giada stays skinny but I digress. We decided to order the small antipasti platter for an appetizer which was exactly as follows, two bacon wrapped dates, two tiny crostini topped with a slice of beef tenderloin, and two different stuffed peppers which came to a total of 4 items on the plate and it was $26. My husband then had a mortadella pizza, which seemed to be the best value on the menu for $13. He had the tomato soup also. I had the tricolore salad consisting of arugula, prosciutto, dates and some other things that weren't overly memorable for $17. We then each had the Brazilian wagyu beef short rib dinner which was very delicious but we should've ordered one meal and shared it because it was a whopping $56 each and we both couldn't finish it. The bill came to $205. It's probably the only expensive meal we will have this trip. I just can't see spending that much money on portions like that and had I realized in advance it was a small portioned menu, I most likely would've skipped this place even though I love Giada.",

    "text": "My wife and I recently went to Giada for our anniversary. We had requested a table by the window three months prior. When we showed up for our reservation they put us in a corner with barely any view. We informed the hostess of our disappointment, but were essentially ignored. That was by far the biggest complaint. A restaurant of this caliber should have been more accommodating. Our server was really good and informative, but I didn't like the way the server had to push a special three course meal that came with a pic of Giada and an autograph. Really?  Is this standard at a celebrity restaurant?  The food was very average.  Not the bang I was hoping for. Do yourself a favor and avoid the celebrity tourist trap restaurant. Not worth it.",

    "text": "I would love to give this place at least 4 stars but there were a couple of problems that are hard to overlook.  I am a huge fan of Giada's and booked her restaurant 2 months ago, so looking forward to a great meal.  The hostesses were great and did honor the request for a window table, but it was half an hour after the reservation time.  No biggie because the room is comfortable and the view was fantastic.  The waiter was very good and tried his best to push the tasting menu, but we already knew what we wanted.  Here is the breakdown of dishes.  1.  Lobster Arancini- 8  Very good... red sauce was the best part. 2.  Shrimp Scampi- 8  Marscapone made this dish, but shrimp seemed of a lesser quality.  Polenta cake was perfect. 3.  Artchoke Soup- 10  What an amazing soup, great taste and texture. 4.  Pasta Fagiole- 10  My partner loved it. 5.  Lobster Ravioli-10  This was too delicious to describe, perfect dish. 6.  Rack of Lamb- 3  The pictures on Yelp make this dish look great, but our lamb was incredibly fatty.  The waiter said it was because it was Colorado lamb and I felt intimidated not to send it back.  Never again; there were only 4 tiny bites out of the whole dish.  The spinach served with it was delicious, though.      The worst part of it was the half hour wait between the soup course and the FAT of the Lamb course.  Way too long of a wait.  The server did say a couple of times that it would be right up, but never apologized for the wait.  That lamb dish was $45 for nothing... I want my money back!  Overall it was a decent experience, but not worth $240.  The bottles of wine start in the $50 range and go up from there.  There should be more reasonably priced options, especially in the Italian categories... been to Italy several times and even good wines are a bargain.  They are trying to hype this restaurant as more casual dining as if you were having dinner in someones home.  Somewhat pricey for a home cooked meal.    Probably would not return for dinner, but might try lunch sometime if Giada has some amazing paninis on the menu.  One more item of interest- We saw tank-tops, tee shirts, tennis shoes, shorts, midriffs, sandals and every other type of dress here.  Not sure there is a dress code.",

I'm not a vegan but this was wonderful.  To offset that, we had the sweet corn and spicy sausage. Yum yum. Side note, a table nearby had the Cacio e Pepe Bucatini and it looked sooooo good.

Admittedly we are fans of Giada's food  from watching her on TV, but the evening and food surpassed all expectations. Our servers name was Lauren ( she seemed like less of a server by the end of the night, and more like a great friend ) her passion for the food, the restaurant and her enthusiasm was incredible.  My hubby and I both had the tasting menu - we couldnt have made a better decision.  We started with the shared antipasti - which worked for both of us ( I being vegetarian. The next course was epic - David had Giadas famous Lemon Spaghetti with Shrimp and I had the Vegetable Bolognese - easily the best pasta dish I have ever eaten.  Our mains-  for me - an amazing Eggplant Stack - with an incredible tomato sauce.  The Eggplant was cooked in a style that seemed almost deep-fried but wasn't - not sure how it was done - but it was delicious.  David had the amazing Salmon - and the mains were accompanied with an amazing corn dish - creamy and spicy and roasted lemon potatoes. The dessert - was equally divine served from a traditional dessert trolley - where you could pick as many as you wanted. Giadas restaurant is on a great corner overlooking - Las Vegas Blvd and Flamingo Blvd.  The interior is relaxed and chic.  The service is impeccable and the food incredible.  The tasting menu - considering the courses, as well as the special tasting menu that you get to take home - it comes complete with recipes cards as well as a signed photo of Giada is well worth the price.  We loved our evening - and we loved how special Lauren made this for us.  We will return.  Thank you to Nate and Anthony too for your great service.  Giada is wonderful.",

We got there at our reservation time and there was no hostess at the entrance. When we finally got seated, everything took extremely long. We ordered drinks, and it took so long for them to come that we were wondering if they forgot about them. We all pretty much ordered the same thing, and when the food came out, all the plates came out except one. They probably forgot it, because we waited and waited and we had to ask for it before they went back to check and bring it out.  The food itself was pretty tasty. I had the lobster hash which the waiter highly recommended. Good portion of lobster and vegetables. Toasts came with jam, mascarpone cream and nutella. Yum! My friend and I had some non-alcoholic cocktails. Wouldn't recommend it for sure, not much taste to them. Stick with the juices if you want something non-alcoholic.  The atmosphere was amazing and the decor was beautiful. Would probably not recommend this though unless you have a lot of time to spare and nothing planned for a while after your reservation.",

Food was delicious.  They do know how to flavor their food. The spaghetti was my favorite.  I love the lemony light cream sauce, the noodle was el dente, n the shrimp large n taste like lobster.  Loved it. We ended our meal w the peach souffle. If you love souffle or never had one you must try it.   Looking forward to coming back n eating the spaghetti...BEST SPAGHETTI EVER",

What ended up happening is we didn't even order from the restaurant week menu because everything sounds so good.   What did we order:  - Dolce Vita [non-alcoholic drink ~ blood orange flavored] - American Breakfast - Cavatalli with Salmon [great recommendation by our server] - Antapasta [small size]  It doesn't hurt that we got a table by the window so we can see the strip, amazing!",

    "text": "Lovely dinner!  I took my 79 year old mother with me on a work trip to Vegas and we had a blast.  I wanted to take her to a nice restaurant on our last night there and told her we could go anywhere she wanted to.  When she found out there was a restaurant in Vegas by Giada she was 100% sure this is where she wanted to go.  This was a real treat for my her.  I am able to dine in some pretty nice restaurants when I travel, but she has never had this kind of opportunity.  The service was fabulous and as my mother put it; \"so professional\"! :-) We truly enjoyed the meal.  We shared everything and it was perfect.  The appetizer of bacon wrapped and stuffed dates had a little kick to them, but loved them.  We had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and it wasn't heavy like so often a pasta dish can be.  It was light, yet layered with lots of cheesy, lemony flavor and the shrimp were plump and cooked to perfection.  Finally, we ended with a peaches and cream souffle and let me tell you - this was one of the best desserts I've ever had.  It was decadent, but again light and airy.  We were full, but didn't have that \"ugh, I'm stuffed\" feeling afterwards. Aside from watching my mother have such a great time, I believe one of the main highlights was the view.  With it being up on the 2nd (or maybe 3rd) floor, you had a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountain.  It was a magical night and I will not soon forget seeing my mom truly enjoy such \"luxury\".  I kind of get choked up thinking about it.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch with a few friends on a Friday morning!  Setting: located inside the Cromwell, it's only a short walk from the garage to the entrance and the entrance to the escalators leading to Giada. Beautiful gold, cream, and peachy pink accents! The dining room has a very nice view of the Las Vegas strip from the south to the west (you can see the Paris Eiffel Tower, Bally's, the water fountain show at the bellagio, and the strip!)   Service: Billy was our server and very nice! Being a school teacher, I'm very impressed by his way of explaining the menu to us and giving us suggestions for our first time-thank you! My friends and I were a bit much-taking photos of food and asking for photos to be taken of us 4. Billy was patient and took some great photos-thanks again! (The hostess out front was also very gracious in taking our photos in front of the Giada sign and taking them with her known \"optimal angles\". Girl was right, those photos were awesome!)  Food: absolutely delicious! We came from brunch and did the set $55 brunch menu which came with an antipasti of the day (Giada chosen appetizer), pastries/baked goods, romaine salad, 1 choice of 3 entrees, and 1 choice of 3 desserts.   Appetizers: salad, cheese/meat charcuterie type plate, and assortment of baked goods Entrees: 3 of my friends chose the salmon Benedict, and I had the Giada Burger with added egg and bacon.  Dessert: Lemon ricotta cookie ice cream sandwich (came with 2 that are slightly large than Macarons with a hefty sorbet type filling) , Leaning tower of chocolate & espresso (tall slice of cake with 4+ layers!), and two Limoncello souffles with creme anglaise (very large hot souffles in a mug in which a server pours the creme on top!) honestly, the limoncello souffle can be shared because each of us getting our own dessert was hard to finish even when sharing!   Overall delicious and the decor is beautiful! Do be advised that it is a bit pricey, not overly, but still a more classy brunch with tip and all since you are paying for the view, ambience, AND Giada's food. (And Especially if you are like us and want everything!) I'm sure if you ordered just entrees and a dessert to share, you'd save a pretty penny!   PS. The Cromwell does charge for parking and unfortunately there is no validation at Giada's. (11:30am to about 2pm cost me $12)   PPS. If you check in on yelp, you can get a \"Prosecco taste\" or a dessert cookie! Obviously...we opted for the Prosecco",

As a huge Giada de Laurentiis fan, I was so excited to finally come to the restaurant. I was thinking about getting the prix fixe menu but decided against it when I realized the menu was different from some of the yelp pictures. I also believe the portions are smaller.   We received olive bread and rosemary facaccia along side mascarpone butter and olive oil pesto. The bread could have been served warm but nonetheless was delicious  We ordered the Romaine Salad and Smashed Potatoes to share and I ordered the Bucatini for my main plate. Even though the Smashed Potatoes we're drowning in Parmesan cheese, I enjoyed everything. The spaghetti was al dente as Giada always speaks of. It wasn't super cheesy but the little bit of ricotta was the best topping to the dish.  Our server, Rocco, was super helpful and very suggestive. I appreciated his knowledge to all the questions we had regarding the dishes.  The one downside to this restaurant would be that we mentioned it was our anniversary and we didn't receive anything in return; honestly, I just wanted a bag of lemon ricotta cookies as some restaurants either comp your dessert or provide you with a tiny gift like chocolate truffles (or in this scenario, lemon ricotta cookies); which you can get for free with a Yelp check in at Giada's Pronto location. No big deal. It was just the little things I wanted to jot down",

I had the lobster ravioli, a friend had the crab risotto, and my other friend had the bucatini (excuse my spelling). Bucatini was spicier than I imagined and wouldn't recommend if you can't handle the spice. Highly recommend the crab risotto.   Tiramisu baked alaska was good! I missed the part where kahlua was added and would've let the fire burn a little longer for less alcohol flavor.   We were lucky to be assigned to a window seat overlooking Bellagio and Casear across the street. Wonderful way to spend a night with white wine and view.",

We made a reservation before coming in -- as you always should do when in Vegas. #IYKYK  I really decided to treat myself and ball out. As a group, we split several dishes, including the Orzo meatballs which were DELICIOUS. I could have eaten the whole plate by myself but ~sharing is caring.~ We also ordered two Cacio e Pepe Bucatini (pasta in the cheese wheel) and WOW. So. Dang. GOOD.   For my meal, I ordered a Caesar salad and the Veal Chop Saltimbocca. Both were incredible, but the Veal Chop specifically was to die for. I'm so happy I decided to splurge for my meal, because every bite was worth the costly check.  I highly suggest making a reservation to Giada for your next Vegas trip and really enjoy the amazingness that is Giada De Laurentiis.",

My only downfall and the reason I gave it 4 stars is that my main course was an fried eggplant and avocado dish. It looked beautiful but it was not good. Being an amazing chef- its exhausting at every Italian restaurant eggplant parmesan is the go to vegetarian dish- there are SO many more options! Wish that was done a little better and the eggplant was chewy and the avocado did not compliment it at all.  Otherwise,  will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas- Salud!",

There's nothing like a good meal with friends-sharing memories, laughs and having good conversation while eating quality food is one of my favorite ways to spend time with my loved ones. And that is how I'd sum up my experience at Giada.  The bread they put on the table is incredible-it comes with salt, pesto olive oil, and mascarpone butter. One of the best bread plates I've ever had. I also ordered Parmesan with honey and prosciutto di Parma as antipasti. Guys, please please please do yourselves a favor and get the Parmesan with honey. I know it may sound out of the ordinary to some, but it's honestly the absolute BEST way to eat Parmesan. When my friends tried it they all were shocked at how much they loved it because they said they would've never thought to pair Parmesan with honey. The prosciutto was also INCREDIBLE. So, get that too.  For the main course, my husband and I split the cacio e pepe in a cheese wheel (pecorino toscano I believe). Now, about half way through one of our servers came and told us to make sure we scrape the cheese out of the wheel and eat it with our pasta because the entire cheese wheel is edible (besides the rind obviously). Omg y'all. IT WAS SO GOOD. Like, it was warm and slightly crispy on the edges and had the most delectable flavor. I'm so glad our server mentioned this to us because I would've been so upset if we missed out on this part of our meal.  Speaking of our server, the service was top notch. Everyone we encountered was incredibly professional, friendly and informative. Without a doubt, I'll be back at Giada the next time I'm in Vegas. Thanks for an amazing dining experience!",

He large glass ceiling to floor windows allows for a lot of natural sunlight and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. They also have a photo booth in the lounge area for waiting parties.  We ordered the lobster hash, cavatelli, cannelloni, burger, and chocolate chip pancakes. The best dish BY FAR was the cannelloni. It's filled with crab and is not too heavy but just cheesy enough. The cavatelli and burger were pretty bland and we had to ask for extra salt on the side.   I'm pretty sure the waiter also forgot about the lobster hash because we had to remind him and it came out 25 minutes after everything else. There were maybe 5 pieces of lobster in the entire dish- would not recommend.   Overall, not sure if I would come back to Giada's, maybe for the lemon ricotta  cookies, aesthetic, and the hope of maybe meeting Giada in person, haha.",

But we totally agreed on every dish we ordered!  The octopus was amazing. Very tender and had a great smile flavor. Perfectly prepared and paired with a citrus salad. So good! We also had the orzo meatballs. The red sauce with the meatballs was out of sight!  The main course, my favorite- cacio e pepe! This was amazingly prepared and well balanced. It is easy to go over board on this dish but it was perfect. My wife got the mushroom flatbread which was also good. But I wanted something unique and different.   Then the desserts. Need I say more! We left perfectly full with the proper portion size and amazingly fresh food.",

    "text": "So my husband and I come here approximately once a month for our favorite entree, cacio e pepe. Handmade bucatini in a pecorino cheese wheel. The first time we had it was 9/2/2018 (according to my Instagram) and it was incredible. They brought it tableside and tossed and turned it and we saw the cheese melting inside the cheese wheel covering each strand of bucatini.  Since them, each time we've come to order it, it has not been as amazing. It usually comes out lukewarm and not hot enough to realllly melt that cheese. However, this visit last night, it appeared to already have been stirred up and the food runner plated it immediately after bringing it out, no tableside show.   My husband took a bite and said it was room temperature to his dismay. We were starving and did not feel like waiting but we did want to tell our server Vicenzo about the lack of heat and how it's served completely changed from the first time. He was great, offering to bring us a new one, which we declined because we had to get back home.   We told him we did not blame him one bit but just wanted to provide the feedback since we do visit so often and order this each time. He was great and said he would definitely speak to someone about it which is appreciated. I really hope that feedback gets to someone who can fix this. I truly feel that expediting it immediately after the pasta is cooked would make it perfection.    Overall I love this place. I love the food, the beautiful view, and the decor.   Our go-to order is usually a bellisimo (rum, strawberry puree, basil and I want to say aperol) and my husband really likes the cosmo blanco.   We ALWAYS order the orzo meatballs with the pasta. They're so good and if I'm feeling particularly fat, I'll scoop cheese from the wheel and slap it on the crunchy bread that comes out with the cacio e pepe and then dip it in into the leftover sauce from the meatballs. I highly recommend!  This particular visit I tried the octopus salad and I'm definitely getting it again. It was so tender and delicious, not rubbery one bit which can easily happen. I'm very glad I tried it.   One more thing I noticed after we left, we always have our cheese wheel boxed up and given to us. We did not this time and to be fair, we didn't ask for it because it's usually just given to us. Which we've always appreciated because it's fun to continue eating cheese the next day.   All in all, many thanks and a shout out to Vincenzo for taking care of us so well. We had a great time minus the lukewarm pasta.",

Appetizers - we tried both the orzo and chicken marsala meatballs. Both plates had 4 quarter sized meatballs for $12 each. The chicken balls and mushrooms were good, but nothing to write home about. The orzo meatballs might have been ok... if not for copious amounts of lemon!  One of us had the polenta waffle with fried eggs... it was decent.  The other two of us had the \"lobster roll\"... this was not a lobster roll.  This was a crostini with a lot of celery, some small lobster scraps in a sauce that had way too much acid in it (could it have been lemon?).  The side dish of fried zucchini was not greasy, but it was cold and was sliced so thinly that you could not get it on your fork.  Price - including tip and not including one of the lobsters... $150.00  Looking around at other tables around us... a lot of very small food for a lot of money... see ya!",

    "text": "Walking along the strip around lunch time on a recent trip to Vegas I thought I'd venture out to try Giada. As I walked up the stairs and was seated in the rather bland ambiance of what looked like a big hotel room, I quickly realized that my meal and experience was on par with my walk...totally pedestrian. Leave your Lamborghini at home because you won't want to waste the valet parking on this passionless restaurant. Yes, you will need to ask for salt and pepper for this flavorless fare. I was pretty surprised that the red wine by the glass was served warm. It wasn't the right temperature at all for high end restaurants and I sampled two before I chose the better. Believe me they were both pedestrian. I think I decided on the Chianti because I had ordered the spinach and prosciutto pizza with ricotta cheese. I told them to leave the meat off as I am a vegetarian and there weren't many options for me. The server steered me away from ordering a pasta when I asked her which she thought I would enjoy more-the pizza or the pasta? She actually shook her head when I asked about one of the pastas. I can't imagine how bad the pasta would have been. This pizza had the stingiest weak flimsy crust with absolutely no flavor. The spinach was decent (the only tasty part of the pizza) but it was if someone had barfed ricotta cheese all over it. It was so goopy with the ricotta that you couldn't even hold the pizza up with your hand. Sorry to be so graphic but it was that bad! There was no seasoning and I had to ask for salt and pepper and quickly. Reading other reviews, they should hand them out to guests as the walk in OR maybe they should cook food with flavor and passion. When you play in the big leagues with big prices, and a famous celebrity chef named Giada expect guests to have an expectation. Giada does not deliver. Literally...joking but Giada doesn't deliver on any level. Keep walking right on by this jam joint! Even Pedestrians deserve better!",

    "text": "Believe the very moderate reviews.  Had my third dinner at Giada this past Saturday and it will be the last, as one does not need to spend money on mediocre restaurants in Vegas.  The problems are that the food lacks a degree of care in ensuring that what is put on the plate is worthy of a high end restaurant.  Shrimp Cocktail starter:  Nice large portion, but the shrimps were originally overcooked, and then either frozen or held for a long time in water, as there was minimal flavor to the flesh of the shrimp.    Lobster Ravioli: Very bland, slightly overcooked and just not something one would look forward to.  Lemon Spaghetti:  Again a super bland shrimp is used as the protein in this dish and is of the quality you might expect from an Olive Garden.  Dessert (can't remember name but it is like a Pavlova with merengue):  Really chewy merengue and did not have that crunchy consistency one would want to have.  In each of the three times I have been in three years, the quality of the food has consistently decreased.  Unless the owners of this restaurant take steps to improve quality and change the menu around a bit, as it is getting stale, this restaurant will likely not be here much longer.",

Hubby returns to our table, I smile sweetly and say to him \"I'm ready to LEAVE when you are\".  And we did.  We went to Vintner Grill...review to follow....

Too much cheese and the pesto had a mint taste to it. Yes basil is from the mint family but it shouldn't taste like mint. The others that I was with had pizza and one of the sandwiches.

Pretty basic. Thought it would be a dining  experience, I was wrong. I don't think I will go back. There are many better choices in Las Vegas. Ridiculously over priced when you considered the service.",

The restaurant itself is gorgeous! It is very snazzy and has a great view of the strip.   Do yourself a favour and order the LEMON SPAGHETTI!!! My husband who is not a big fan of pasta was drooling over this. It was so creamy and decadent and worth every penny! Another favourite was the Mortadella pizza. Lemon Ricotta and PB&J cookies were also the bomb!",

    "text": "Had the most lovely dining experience at Giada yesterday! It is one of  my favorite restaurants and so I was quite dismayed to read all the negative reviews and low ratings on Yelp prior to our going there. We took friends for breakfast at noon, and we were totally thrilled by our dining experience!!!  The main reason I am writing this review is because of our outstanding server, Christoper. He is truly one of the best servers I have ever had!!! He was so friendly and open and kind to us and had the most infectious smile. He had a complete grasp of the menu and made the most excellent suggestions when asked. He was so helpful and was always there when we needed him. He took a photo for us and even showed us how to shoot pictures on our iPhones without having the glare from all the beautiful light that streams into the restaurant from the vast windows. One of the things I liked most about him was that he was also very discreet and totally professional. He did not feel that he needed to put on a \"show\" for us as sometimes happens with servers in Las Vegas. He was just always there for us in the background when we needed him.  I also want to complement our backwaiter. I neglected to get his name, but he was so friendly and gave us so much information about the delicious G cocktail when we asked him. Also, our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty!  I made a reservation for noon the previous day and requested a table by the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains, as this was our friends' first time at Giada. We were seated immediately by a lovely, friendly hostess and got the perfect table.  The ambience of the restaurant is everything you would expect from Giada, elegant, understatedly pretty and in the best of taste, from the decor and furniture right down to the tableware and placemats.  The food as usual was superb! We ordered scrumptious strawberry and pineapple polenta waffles and a carbonara pizza to start, which we all shared. Our friends ordered lobster hash. I had the salmon cakes benedict which were outstanding!!!! The hubs ordered the sausage and eggplant lasagna which was very small but as other yelpers have said is not meant to be a main course. It came with a small arugula salad and as my husband is not a large eater, it was the perfect size for him. The taste and presentation  of all our food was beyond excellent. My only complaint was that parts of the lobster hash were cold when the dish came out.  The cocktails were wonderful. I had a peach bellini and my girlfriend had the signature cocktail, the G, which was out of this world.  Yelpers have complained about the portion sizes of the food, but we were stuffed by the time we left. The portions are small, more comparable to Paris than America, but they are not minuscule by any means. The time it took to get our food may have been slow by some standards, but in my opinion was perfectly paced in order for us to enjoy our cocktails and conversation The whole dining experience was definitely pleasant and relaxing.  I just cannot say enough about the wonderful experience we had at Giada!!!",

We had a seat by the window where I could see the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Towel and our server, Rocco, was so friendly and respectful to the fact that we had a romantic dinner and wanted to take our time to enjoy it. Food was really tasty, from appetizers to dessert, and worth the price we paid at the end. I would totally recommend a visit to Giada's restaurant at Cromwell Casino and most likely try it again if I ever go back to Las Vegas.",

Expaditing all of our plates to us after a thorough critique.   I visit Vegas 4-5 times per year and I was looking forward to staying at CET newest property the Cromwell, though that did not work out as planned I had higher hopes for my Giada birthday dinner.    I had made the reservation for 10 people 1 month before, and found out the day of that there were 5 other friends that would like to attend, I was staying in the hotel so I thought speaking to them face to face would be easier. I spoke to the adorable hostess and asked her if it was possible to add on 5 more to my reservation for that evening at 9pm, she looked went and retrieved an equally adorable girl who promptly looked at me and said \"you have no reservation for this evening\"  I said I most certainly do I confirmed it last week.. while looking straight down , and in a monotone voice said  I'm sorry you do not.      What can we do to fix this problem I asked trying to stay as calm as possible. You can arrive early tonight and perhaps we will have something for you, bit a party of 15 at such a short notice is very difficult.       Tell me you are kidding it is not short notice your restaurant lost my reservation for my birthday, \"we do not lose reservations she insisted\"          I turned ,went down the escalator and called Wolfgang Pucks at MGM  who after a total of 30 seconds said. We would love to have you and your guests here. Great good, personal service, in an open atmosphere well clear of all of the CET management issues at the Cromwell.      For those of you wondering why I gave it three stars after all of this inconvenience and frustration, I had the lemon spaghetti and a  bag of donuts the day before .",

    "text": "We had been wanting to try Giada during our spring and summer trips to Vegas. This fall, we noticed that the restaurant had just begun serving breakfast. Seemed like a perfect opportunity. The entrance is inside the Cromwell casino, and up a large staircase adorned with Italian film posters. At the top, we were met by the hostess, who was extremely attractive in a stylish white dress, but a bit cold and humorless. My wife tried to banter on the way to the table, and was met with silence. The room is lovely. It is bright with very clean design. We were given a window table with a marvelous view of the Vegas Strip. I was facing the Bally's sign with a news, sports, and stock market crawl. No need for a morning newspaper. Upon being seated, we immediately caught a very strong smell of smoke. It was strong enough to create concern that we were going to leave with our clothes reeking. My wife asked our French waiter if he smelled the smoke. He responded, \"Of course. That is the wood-fired stove\". He gave us a look as though he thought we were stupid. Coffee was delicious. Even in the morning, it seemed that each cup was individually french pressed. The breakfast menu contains a lot of non-conventional breakfast fare, although they do offer an \"American Breakfast\", featuring eggs and your choice of bacon or sweet Italian sausage meatballs. One of Giada's signature features is a large antipasto bar. This is open for breakfast. We were offered seats there, but opted for the window table. My wife ordered a Caprese Frittata. It is made with 3 eggs, buffala mozzarella, heirloom tomato and basil. For an extra $5, you can add prosciutto. I had Italian Hash, made with potatoes, Nueske bacon, salami, peppers, tomato, and onion. It comes with sunny side up eggs. I asked for poached. All of the food was outstanding - fresh and delicious. I also ordered juice. They have an interesting selection, ranging from a green concoction to one with pineapple, apple, and lemon. I opted for pink grapefruit with crushed mint. Delicious, and well worth the $9 price tag (for me, at least). Breakfast was accompanied by crunchy Italian toast and a trio of spreads. I used the Nutella. The tab for 2 came to about $60. If you are staying at any of the many Caesars properties in the vicinity, you can charge to your room. So, in summary, the food was all outstanding. The room was bright and attractive. The help was very efficient but kind of snooty. If you go in the morning when the wood-burning stove is fired up, expect to smell like a fire-fighter when you leave.",

Then they talk about a \"tasting menu\" which is $120/person and then a regular menu... Very confusing, overwhelming and unnecessary.  We went with the tasting menu and what a mistake! You get one tiny antipasto to share and then they let you choose two pastas and two entries. They brought out the pasta dishes and we lol'D!! Literally 5 pieces of pasta and it was all cold and lacked flavor. They finally brought out the main dishes after 2.5 hours and they were cold!! We left and got a slice of pizza down the street... Totally wasted and ruined our night! Bottom line: rip off tourist trap! Go to Roma... An amazing local spot for a fraction of the price! No more food network chef's restaurants! Only NOLA...",

    "text": "I was so excited to try out Giada's new restaurant in Vegas. I love Giada's cooking shows, and have several of her cookbooks, so I'm a huge fan. That's probably why I was so let down when I had one of the worst dining experiences here.   My mom and I made a lunch reservation at Giada's. The location is great and the decor is lovely. We also had a blast in the photobooth. We were seated next to the window overlooking the strip, we was nice.   After being seated, it probably took 10 minutes before we were greeted by a server who poured us water. Than we waited another 10 minutes for our actual server to greet us. Since we had already been at our table for 20 minutes, we were ready to order. We ordered an antipasti to start (mozz with citrus chili pesto), the arugula salad and the tubetti pasta. Well, after waiting 45 minutes, a server brought out our pasta. We told her that we never received our first two courses and really didn't want our last course until we could have the others. We also were never brought bread, and when we asked about this the server more or less rolled her eyes. I also must add that it was nearly impossible to get our water refilled. I think I had my empty glass sitting on the table for 35 minutes before I tracked someone down to ask them if I could have more water.   So finally after another 20 minutes after sending our pasta back, our antipasti arrived...in a chipped bowl. So had to send it back again. Another 15 minutes passed...I will say that the anitpasti was very good and I would recommend it. Next the salad was brought out (for the second time). It was also pretty good, my only thought was that it had too much dressing. And then after another long wait, the pasta was brought out again. We were told that the pasta would be remade. It was very obvious that this was the same pasta that was brought to our table 45 minutes earlier, just heated up. The pasta was cold and the top of the pasta was stale. Finally we were given the bill, which not surprisingly took forever to get the server to take our credit card.   The service really needs to change. Our server was pretty horrible, and all the other tables around us were experiencing the same issues. The table next to us said they had to wait 1 hour before they received their drinks, and another hour just to get bread. The table next to them walked out. I don't know if the issue is the servers, but it all stems to the management which definitely needs to change if this place is going to succeed.   In closing, I will not return to this restaurant nor will I recommend it, which makes me very sad to admit. I will continue to cook Giada's recipes though...at home that is.",

The drinks, Barbarello, cool and refreshing without over powering of any one flavor. The flatbread wild mushroom, perfect temperature, and flavors that made you mouth water for the next bite.

Shared the orzo meatballs and crab arancini to start- not a big fan of meatballs so I just tried one and it was ok, but the arancini was delish- great sauce.  Then had the caprese, which was so flavorful- great mozzarella.  Finally ended with the scallop risotto which was amazing; risotto is so hit or miss and this one was just right.  Also tried my friend's lemon spaghetti, which was very unique and the shrimp were enormous and very flavorful.  The service is really amazing and the view of the strip was great- could see the fountains at Bellagio from my seat.  Only disappointment was I was so full, I didn't have any room left to try one of the amazing looking desserts!",

    "text": "Delightful dinner for two this evening at Giada's in the Cromwell's Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas.  Except for being placed in corner table which walled us on two sides everything else was exceptional.  Service by Casey was impressive from start.  She has the menu committed to memory with ability to cite all entres and options to enhance dining experience.  Giada offers a variety of Pasta dishes , but I had the pan seared salmon with lentil and succotash with an amazingly delicious sauce.  My wife had the surf and turf; a wonderful filet and seafood ravioli and baked brussel sprouts.  She raved about the flavor.  The portion size initially appeared modest but the big flavors left no appetite unfulfilled.  Layout is on second floor on corner accross from Caesars Palace and Bellaggios.  A little traffic noise, but attention was on food rather than outside.  My salmon was seared to perfection and I found myself smothering each bite with the lentil and sauce as it complimented the salmon so marvelously.  Restaurant was full to capacity, but seating was prompt (reservations recommended) and service was exceptional considering the number of diners.  Meal was a little pricey by our standards, but a good value in view of the quality, exceptional service, and overall experience.  We'll be back.  Thank you server Casey and other members of the staff.  Mike Wifler, San Diego",

    "text": "It took us 3 trips to Vegas to get a reservation. Sadly it was not worth the wait. The restaurant is well designed, open and airy. The food was inconsistent as was the service. The drinks were completely overpriced even for Vegas. My wife's pasta gave a new meaning to al dente. It was cold and under cooked(she is Italian) and she knows her pasta. The spinach with raisins and walnuts was very good. Our guests liked their Brussels sprouts and were disappointed with their pasta dishes also. If you want good Italian try Scarpetta, pricey but satisfying.",

We had the wild mushrooms, eggplant parm fries and the tenderloin crostini to start. All were good - eggplant was a little too greasy for my liking. Entrees were also excellent, we had the rigatoni, branzino and salmon. Also recommend the apple tart for dessert!",

    "text": "First I would like to say I was super excited to try Giada's restaurant. Watching her on the food network channel I really had thought this would be a wonderful restaurant. OH Boy! was I wrong it was the worst dinner experience I've ever had. First when we arrived we were waiting on our other friends so we went to the bar for a drink I ordered a drink and waited 10min till I asked where my drink was they said they weren't sure they would find the waitress. I told them to cancel my drink and just to seat us. When we were seated we waited another 10 minutes before anyone even approached us. At that time they told us that they were going to have three people helping on our table, the captain and two others. We ordered a bottle of wine which had taken 20 minutes to receive. We then ordered our salads, appetizers and dinner entrees. The appetizer was just average very very small portions for very high prices.  My salad was the signature salad  which turned out to be very bland and the dinner was just less than average. We all ordered pasta. Two out of the four were very nice but super salty and I'm not against salt. One of the other pasta dishes was just average. And the fourth pasta dish which was  Giada's signature pasta was just awful. I was so surprised on how terrible the food was since I own her cookbooks and make many recipes that I enjoy. The service is Horrendous! We were left with dirty dishes on the table empty water glasses and they never came and checked if we would like to order another bottle of wine. All four of us will never go back. There are too many wonderful restaurants in this town. Just because she's on the food network channel doesn't mean her restaurants good.",

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and was asked to have a seat in the bar area as it would be a few minutes.  After waiting 10 minutes past our reservation time and watching several other parties that came in after us get seated my husband went to find out what was going on.  He was told we were next to be seated.  We were seated in the worst area of the restaurant (in our opinion) back in the corner on a long bench with tables squeezed together.  I guess to have the view you need to make a reservation a month out and then bribe the hostess.  Our server never gave any type of explanation of the menu (the server at the table next to us did though).  Very unpersonable, never checked back on us.  Our food was delivered to our table before the juice I ordered was.  Needless to say we won't be back.  You really should value locals as much as you do the tourists.",

    "text": "Not Terrible. When you expect to pay $400-500 for dinner for four, you just want something more than that. This was meant to be our 'big splurge' meal for our weekend in Vegas. Here's the lowdown:  Ambience: Lovely, modern Italian upscale restaurant, busy. Tables are so close together that I had to apologize to gent behind me as I accidentally bumped his chair several times. Service: Good, slow paced, but that's good for a restaurant experience of this $$ scale- you kind of want time to stop for a while to enjoy the meal. Servers attentive and friendly. Food: RECOMMEND: Giada's favorite antipasti: delicious bites of crostini, olives, mushrooms, and other goodies. This was $60, but enough for all four of us to enjoy as an appetizer. If only we had stopped there. The green salad, lightly dressed with a vinagrette and parmesan, looked delicious. The LOBSTER RAVIOLI was chock-full of nice lobster pieces and very delicious. Now for the downside: Soup du jour was a roasted cauliflower. Meh, It was okay, a small portion. My partner had the minestrone and I had a taste. This was in no way minestone. It was a thin, processed gruel that had no identifiable vegetables in it and tasted of the singe at the bottom of the pot. The frico of parmesan (a little crisp of grilled shredded parm) couldn't save the flavor and, soaked in the gruel, the texture suffered too. I wanted to have another bite just to make sure it was as bad as I'm describing, but I stopped at the first bite without regret. Partner and I shared the chicken cacciatore style, about $60, meant for two. Note that style-part. This was not standard cacciatore. This was a whole chicken (a petite one) and the parts were breaded and deep fried. The fried chicken, stacked prettily on both sides of the platter, was so dry and tastelessly overcooked there wasn't enough of the small crock of a vegetable ragout type sauce to save it. We did finish it, which tells you how tiny this bird was- with this amount of food on the table, imagine each of us eating four pieces of standard fried chicken. Relative had a risotto dish which she described as making better herself and other had the grilled lamb chops which he described as tasteless, without seasoning. Overall, the food presentation was just as pretty as Giada herself, but lacked the expected excitement and flavor she brings to her show. All four of us were disappointed with the meal. Hope the kinks work themselves out, but we won't be back to see it.",

    "text": "So having visited Giadas at the Cromwell last night I have to say very disappointed, the venue itself is very well situated, beautiful decor and like walking into someone's dining room at their house, it all looks pretty and appealing and that's where in my opinion it all stops. It took over 10 mins for a waiter to touch the table , it took about the same time to get the wine order delivered to us too. The bread was forgotten and had to be asked for. The appetizers arrived and all were tepid , the grilled octopus which I was looking forward to was last to show up and was tasteless and over cooked having being told for its lateness that they were putting a good char on it! Next up was the pasta , they make their own pasta in house in front of you in their open kitchen. Waiter said had to have the lobster and asparagus ravioli, bland and lobster chewy with not even a hint of a sauce to help it. Crab and scallop risotto , the scallop was perfectly cooked and then that was it , an other bland tasteless dish and the crab must have run away as I couldn't detect any in the dish.  Entrees branzino was good , lamb came under cooked and had to refire to get the right temp but was bland and my filet was bland . Wine service was poor too, we had white wines and placed in ice buckets with no ice so our wine started to get warm .  Desert is run a round on a cart and when the waiter puts it on a plate it's has no presentation , the cart I would get rid off and work on presentation .  Maybe one of the reasons it's hard to get into is the service is so slow so there's no tables turning ! It's prices are up there with the rest of the strip and portions small . We all have off nights but they better fix what's wrong or it'll be bye bye Giada!!",

We went in at around 2pm and almost all the good items on the menu were no longer available . We had the chicken Marsala meatballs for antipasti and they were delicious. It was as good as it gets. The carbonara pasta was mediocre. For dessert we had the chocolate tiramisu which was a huge disappointment . Make sure you have a reservation and go for dinner for the extensive menu.",

    "text": "I brought my wife here for her 30th (with 12 others) as she is a big fan of Giada's. In all honesty, this place was not worth it at all. We did have a private area which was nice. It was difficult to get through to the reservation system. Since we had 14 people, I had to talk to the group sales manager. Mine was Sandra Bailey (<a href=\"mailto:sbailey@caesarspalace.com\">sbailey@caesarspalace.com</a>), who was useless as she never returned any of my calls or emails. After speaking with the admins there (who were very helpful) they put me in touch Ilona, who sent me the relevant information. She provided me a list of options and had mentioned that the minimum spend per head was $150 per person. Looking at the menu this seemed like an exorbitant amount for what you get. I booked two separate tables to get around this and then later had them combine them when we arrived. I am glad we didnt go through with the family style. The food is mediocre at best. I had the spaghetti and tried the roast chicken both were not really what I expected from a restaurant representing a world famous chef. One of the guys tried the surf and turf and said that the beef tasted exactly like the roast chicken. The service was good but lets be honest, if the best thing about your restaurant is the ice cube in your drink that has a \"g\" in it, you're wasting your money.",

We go in and there is plenty of open seating.  Some lady who works there was dressed like a cheap hooker in a white/black outfit she had on.  Server was very good at placing the order and asking us if the food was good.  We were sat next to server stand and it was apparent that they weren't too happy to be working there.  Everyone came back to the server stand to stare at us and complain about the tables they had.  Then the lady dressed like a hooker came over to the stand and seem to be joking with them.  I then assumed that she may have been the manager.  I would think that she could find something a bit more family oriented to wear.  Ordered a meat and cheese platter which was quite good and had a nice appearance.  They brought bread with some fancy verbiage as well.  For dinner I ordered the chicken cacciatore style.  I was shocked at what was brought.  I received 2 fried chicken breasts and nothing more.  This was priced at $30.  No expensive presentation or a side.  What really killed me is that this chicken was NOT BONELESS but had bones that I had to cut around or choke on.  My friend ordered the rigatoni.  It came out as a small ladle in a bowl and also lacking presentation.  Shocked by how small the portions are and the price and the quality.  Go to Ruth Chris or Capital Grille or some other fancy place.  You will get a much better meal for less.  I gave 2 stars and not 1 because they server was good even though he didn't have to do anything but take our order.  He wasn't the one who brought the food.  Also, the presentation of them bringing the bread was impressive.  They made the bread seem like you were ordering some fancy bottle of wine.",

My husband booked the table on opentable six months before, because really fans of Giada., he wants make sure we got the dinner!  We arrive within 5 minutes yearly for be in time, but our table ( reserved 6 months yearly) was not ready yet.  The hostess told us we need to wait 10 minutes, I was already upset because that  was our romantic night, but anyway ok, waiting on the nice couch, making around the beautiful restaurant, 10minutes is not a big deal. But 20 minutes later we are still waiting for our table, come on!!! Are you kidding me??!! So my husband began to be impatient and I'm starving. Lets talk with the hostess, there was many table empty why we still waiting. Anyhow we take the table after 30 minutes.  Thanks God!!  Now we waiting for our server another 15 minutes just to get the menu. Ok still our night I don't want do any complain. Finally we ordered!!! The appetizers arrived but we still not have any wine on the table and no bread, we asked several time for that, our server check on us after 10 minutes the appetizers were on the table and finally we got the wine.  Appetizers were good, nothing to die for but good quality of food. The worst surprise was the pasta. I got Fettuccine with tomato carpaccio and my husband spinach gnocchi. My pasta was just a fettuccine in a case of melted butter, after two bite I feel I want throw up, my husbands tortellini was overcooked.  What a shame!!!  A beautiful restaurant on the Strip, nice decor, 30 minutes waiting and we just got horrible food!!!!  Two stars because on the desserts they put a congratulations for our 3 years together. Otherwise I want give 0 stars at this place!!!!",

We came with a business group and had a private room and everything was served family style. Loved the antipasto platter - I could have had that alone for dinner but the courses kept coming. Everything was spectacular, from the bread tray to dessert. An arugula salad was served - I'm not a big fan usually - but her light lemon dressing was so good I ate every bite. Our entrees were tomahawk steak, chicken, and risotto. All were tasty. The best part? Dessert! Save room. Some people at our table said the breakfasts here are excellent also.",

Menu is rather small but everything we had was delicious.  The salad seemed plain but it 'sang' with flavor. According to my friend Lasagna was very good.  And sliders were excellent and unusual.  They were not little burgers as is the norm.  They were little tenderloins in each bun.  The only thing I didn't like was my desert -  Chocolate tower.",

We had Calamari & Shrimp and the Eggplant Fries for appetizers -- mouthwatering! We shared the Lemon Spaghetti with shrimp -- unbelievable, Branzino for the main course with smashed potatoes & roasted cauliflower on the side and Giada's favorite cookies for dessert -- Cliff, our server, hooked it up!   Love the photo booth in the lobby while waiting to be seated...smart idea: you don't realize the length of time of waiting to be seated because it's such a fun distraction.  Hostess was very welcoming.  Cliff was absolutely delightful! Cliff & his service crew was impeccable! ...the food was amazing (Giada doesn't disappoint, which we had no doubt it would) but there is nothing like having great service along with it! Ask for Cliff, he will take care of you. We will definitely come back! Everything is to die for -- truly is! Thanks for the wonderful experience!!",

    "text": "Our weekend in Vegas was about enjoying without costs in mind.  We set out to splurge and had a fantastic time doing it. Being Italian, I am quite picky about Italian cuisine and generally leave these restaurants less than impressed.  Not so at Giada! Rocco, the waiter, and Stephanie, the sommelier, catered to our every need.  They alone are reason enough for the five stars.  I dropped my napkin and within thirty seconds, Rocco was there to replace it.  We chose a four course meal with paired wines and it was phenomenal.  Almost everything was perfect.  I whole-heartedly recommend the lemon/herb crusted lamb as well as the perfectly cooked filet. The only miss this restaurant had was its over-salted fingerling potato side dish. If you ever want to try a wine pairing - do it at Giada... the choices were high quality, perfectly matched each course, and the portion size was wonderful.  We left spending over $500 for two - and felt it was worth it.",

    "text": "We went to Giada last night for the first time. It was one of the best meals I have ever had. We sprung for the tasting menu so that we could experience it all! First off, the bread was amazing! They serve a focaccia that is to die for and a crisp cheese cracker type thing, accompanied by salt, crushed red pepper, crispy capers (yum!), an oil based dip that was amazing and I believe a mascarpone spread.   Then came the second course.... my husband asked the server to choose what to have and I ordered the lemon spaghetti, which is a signature dish. When they arrived my husband also got the lemon spaghetti. He is not one to order pasta at a restaurant but was in heaven with this dish. The dish comes with shrimp, but they graciously substituted mine for chicken. It was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. By this time we were getting full!! But had to keep on going!  The third course was the meat. There was a choice of the 7oz filet, Branzino and I am. It remembering the 3rd choice. I had the branzino. It was accompanied by an oil and olive tapenade. It was the only thing we had all night that was just okay. I was not a huge fan. It lacked in comparison to everything g else we had. My husband had the filet, it was easily the best steak I have had in my life (he shared a bit!!) the sauce made the dish and it was amazing.  And finally dessert... you want to leave room for the dessert! I had the baci, lemoncello cheesecake and the lemon ricotta cookie. (You get 3 choices with the tasting menu...) the baci was lime a Ferero Roche chocolate, it was good but I am not a huge fan to begin with.  The lemon ricotta cookie was so lemony, soft and amazing! The cheesecake was also amazing! My husband had the roasted banana gelato which was incredible, the raspberry tiramisu which was amazing (and not fake raspberry! Which I don't care for! This was great!) and the cheesecake which he also loved.  All in all it was amazing experience and our waiter was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend it for a nice dinner out in Vegas!",

We were seated shortly after at a table with an awesome view overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. Our server was very knowledgeable about everything on the wine, drink and food menus explaining in detail any questions we had. We had a cocktail shrimp appetizer to start along with their bread plates with several condiments to apply and dip. Our dinners were scrumptious (Filet was so tender and the Rigatoni Bolognese was so tasty and colorful). We ended with a dessert (Leaning tower of chocolate and espresso) that was to die for. We ended up with a bit of sticker shock at our final bill but it was well worth it to treat yourself to this wonderful place and terrific food.",

I liked that it was set up like a lounge with a dozen different styles of chairs, a neat little photo booth while you are waiting and nice view of the strip. The food was hit and miss. I enjoyed the chicken Marsala meatballs as a starter. We decided to order three mains and wanted to share the third. I got the three cheese tortellini with braised beef. It was amazing! We shared the seafood risotto and it was cooked well but lacked salt. Not salting a dish that will run you over 30 bucks is sad. My wife had the veil saltimbocca. The serving size was good. It was flavored well but over cooked. We pointed it out to the waiter and he did not dispute it. We did not ask for our money back but he took it off the bill anyway. It was much appreciated and we tipped him well.",

My wife and my in laws had dinner there recently and quite honestly if I had never gone it would never have been missed. They are way over priced for what they offer. Was the food good.

The spaghetti was also good but the cost is now $34 per order even though all the menus online say $28, so that is a pretty hefty increase already.  We were also charged $15 per appetizer even though some were $13 and $14.  Honestly i didnt pay attention when we paid or i would have brought it to the attention of the staff.   I also didn't scrutinize the in hand menu for pricing changes so that part is my fault  Overall Very good food but I agree with the other reviewers that cost per portion is \"off\" even for vegas, and the fact that the spaghetti has already increased over 20% is troublesome.    The hostesses were good, no issues being seated and we didn't feel pressured at all by the wait staff.  Had a great sommelier named Theresa and all in all a good evening but I would encourage the restaurant to update the menu on their own website as well as open table if they want to stop the pricing confusion.",

    "text": "I came in hoping to give this a 5 star rating, I had very high hopes...who wants to be the guy who only writes negative reviews.  This meal had its moments though.  The bread was ok, a greasy olive oil bread with a variety of salts and butters, a cheesy cracker bread was pretty tasty, and I enjoyed the bread sticks while my guest did not.  We started with the Spicy Sausage Arancini and the Romaine Caesar salad.  I thought there was a lack of spiciness to the Arancini (only to realize when the bill came that they brought the lobster Arancini instead) but they were very good, the Caesar has a citrus based Caesar dressing that was just OK.  She ordered the spaghetti and shrimp, the shrimp were huge, one was perfect, the other slightly overcooked, the pasta was slightly overcooked as well.  I ordered the Branzino and it was fantastic.  Came with a tangerine vinaigrette that complimented the fish well.  It was taking quite a while for the main course to come after the apps, but our waiter Diego showed with a couple of flutes of champagne to help with the wait.  Nice touch.  Dessert was the chocolate tarte which was pretty tasty as well.  Dinner came to $132, pretty pricey when no wine was involved.  $6 for a pepsi?  Come on.  Water refills were pretty slow.",

But when they brought the food it was just a simple Italian food. Nothing special.  The same thing that I used to make at home. I'm very disappointed because if it's celebrity chef and that expensive.  It should be something unbelievably delicious.  I've been in Italy. And honestly buying food in the streets of Italy was more delicious and authentic then coming to Giada's restaurant.  It was a big joke. Never gnna come back. Nothing special. Just a simple Italian food that you can eat everywhere.",

Within 30 minutes, the entire restaurant was packed.  I tried the arugula salad and the salmon, which were both phenomenal.   Rob and Martin were the two bartenders taking care of everyone and they both did a great job making sure everyone was being taken care of even though they were getting multiple drink orders every minute. The next time I hope to see a dessert menu and try one of those.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch while on vacation last week. Lunch reservations for Friday were all my husband and I could get. We tried two weeks in advance and the dinner reservations for a party of two were completely booked. Completely our fault for not calling earlier, was just disappointed since the lunch menu is a limited menu and I would have liked to have tried some of her fancier dishes.  I am giving 2 stars because of the terrible wait (with a reservation), the crappy server, and the general lack luster of the food.  I REALLY wanted to love this place. Our reservation was at 2pm and when we arrived they said they were a little behind and asked if we'd like to wait at the bar, so we did. The bartender was great! I ordered a white sangria and it was fabulous. Then it was all downhill from here.  A server came to the bar with a returned drink, loudly complained about the guests at his table, and told the bartender to serve the drink that was returned to the next person who ordered it! I don't think the bartender did, but it was completely unprofessional on the part of the server.   We were finally sat 45 minutes after our reservation, and guess who our server is, the same server with the returned drink situation, disappointing but wanted to give him a 2nd chance.  The food was so-so. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that I feel is worth writing about, good or bad.  The server was pretty awful. Lunch was over a 2.5 hour process, for appetizers, pizza and salad. Then he mischarged us on the final bill, to his detriment, which we pointed out. When he fixed the bill, he left the cash left by other customers in our check, which we also returned.  As I said, I really wanted to love this place, but it needs some work. Love Giada, hope she gets it right.",

My wife and I go to Las Vegas several times per year and we always try new places.  This one however, always seems to make it on the list as a repeat!  We always start at the bar, Martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives.  Bartenders are always professional and funny, with a great story about the olives or something else.  Servers are incredibly well-trained, knowledgeable and seem to have a rich background in fine Italian dining.  Lunch (this last time, AND always) was incredible, Seafood Risotto was the best I have ever had.  My wife loves the spinach/prosciutto pannini.  Everything is off the charts.  The atmosphere is amazing, open kitchen, modern feel, and you can't beat the view.  We've been here 5 times.  I recommend going at lunch for first timers and just enjoying for 2+ hours when it's not as busy or hard to get a reservation, but Dinner is an ALL-out Vegas dining experience.  It seems to be one of the hottest tickets in Vegas right now.  It is now a mandatory stop on our visits there.",

We went for the first time with high expectations and it was good, but not great for the prices. We decided on the tasting menu for $120.00 per person because it was presented to us that we would be getting EVERYTHING listed, but alas that turned out NOT to be True. The appetizers and desserts were served family style, but the entrees were not. This was a very unwelcome surprise. Had we known, we would not have agreed to the tasting menu. We got to select one pasta and one protein only. Once we realized this, it seemed too late to back out as we were with other guests and it would have been too embarrassing.   That being said, I got the lemon spaghetti (delicious, but an appetizer size portion-disappointing) and my husband got the rigatoni. He felt it was nothing special. We both chose the filet mignon as our protein and I have to say it was fabulous. It was served topped with a pesto that really enhanced the flavor. As for the desserts, the chocolate chip cookie was terrible. One of the worst I've ever had.  I did however like the polenta cake. It was different and delicious. My husband loved the lemon cookies, but was disappointed in the tiramisu. Overall, I feel that Giada's is VERY overpriced for what you get.",

Let me start by saying I don't mind paying good money as long as the food is good, which wasn't the case in my experience. I think there should be less focus on \"oh this is giadas favorite cocktail\" and more focus on the food quality. I ordered the chicken Marsala meatballs and they were mediocre, I also ordered the romaine salad which was pretty tasty, what I really regret ordering is the risotto with scallops and crab meat. It tasted and smelled so fishy that I felt nauseous. I will say the scenery is nice inside the restaurant but that's about it. I really wanted to give this place a good review, I really did but it really is what most people said about it... mediocre food for HIGH celebrity prices.",

The wait staff Duc and Luis were lackluster and when asked if our lemon spaghetti was supposed to be served cold they barely acknowledged the comment. This is a celebrity chef restaurant that is trying to slide by on a name but unfortunately it's not worth a visit.",

We had slow service, and our waitress would take one drink order from a couple of us then disappear, we were 14.Then came the food, pasta was under cooked and the scallops were over done. Mixup in drink orders.  Also all the pasta dishes were over salted. We heard a rumor, after this experience that she has fired two chefs already. We talked to 3 different people in charge about our food. They did take some of the bad dishes off our bill after we over heard them talking about how we should of said sometime earlier,  We would had, but we were all so hungry, we had 8:15 reservations and we didn't eat until after 10pm. They should of just listened to the constructive criticism. Very bad service, problem solving and bad food. Why come back here? This is the worst dining experience I've ever had in Vegas. Giada should be embarrassed.",

    "text": "I know it is hip to talk smack on Food Network restaurants, but Giada delivers.  Not like a large pizza to your door \"delivers\" but some of the best food and cocktails on the strip \"delivers.\"   First, the women working at the place are pretty hot.  And the men working at the place are knowledgeable.  I know that sounds sexist.  Actually...rereading that sentence I can honestly say that it is sexist.  However, it is the truth.  Second, the space and view are amazing.  I cannot believe that the Cromwell used to be Bill's Gambling Hall.  That place would give you hepatitis just by walking in the door.  And now, the Cromwell is a shining beacon of no hepatitis....unknowingly at least.  If you bring a call girl up to your room then you are gambling with your clinic tests.  The view from the restaurant is great no matter where you are.  You can see the strip and the fountains.  Very nice view that is rivaled only by the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Seeing as how the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is seemingly within the nether regions of the fountains, it will be hard to beat.  Third, the cocktails are great.  Our waiter talked about the cocktails for a very long time.  He has tried them all.  At first I thought \"wow...very knowledgeable.\"  Then I thought, \"wow...what a degenerate...with some knowledge.\"  Knowledge in any form is valuable.  Oh yeah...get the Barbarella.  Fourth, the food is some of the best.  I tried the Lobster Ravioli, the pizza, the charred octopus, the calamari, and the braised short ribs.  The ravioli were cooked great and were actually quite filling.  The pizza was small (warning to people who are starving), but it was very good.  The waiter did tell me the pizza was small, but I was on my fourth Barbarella and either didn't hear or didn't care.  The octopus was the highlight of the dinner.  It is difficult to cook octopus correctly.  You either serve it nearly raw, and risk getting your mouth sucked to death by the suckers....or you serve it so tough that it can be used as a bungee for some craziness at Stratosphere.  However, this octopus was fully cooked and super tender.  I never tasted octopus so well prepared.  The calamari was great.  Fried well and not greasy.  It was a negative that all of the people at the table loved calamari, which meant that I got about one bite.  I hate my dinner guests.  The braised short ribs were a peculiar thing to try at an Italian restaurant.  I am from Texas.  We know beef and how to prepare it.  What I tasted at Giada was something that any Texas BBQ joint would be proud of.  It did not taste like BBQ, but was tender like it had been smoking for days.  Imagine how tender Keith Richards would be...he has been smoking for decades.  Fifth, the dessert was possibly the best thing we had.  We ordered the chocolate tart.  This thing was amazing.  Not too sweet...not not too sweet (I just coined that phrase)....just right.  We shared it since we were stuffed from all of the other stuff.  Stuffed from the other stuff is another phrase I just coined.  I make a vow before we eat that we will try an app, an entree, a cocktail, and a dessert.  We did well with the dessert.  Our waiter suggested it and says that he tried all of the desserts.  He tried all of the cocktails and the desserts.  He was the living embodiment of Bacchus.  The best restaurant in Cromwell.  That is actually a joke because it is the only restaurant in Cromwell.  However, it is one of the best restaurants on the strip.  You may read other reviews from famous foodies stating the restaurant is not up to par.  Do not listen to these people.  It is trendy to hate on Food Network.  It is trendy to act \"high-brow\" and believe you are above the peasants that worship Food Network celebrity chefs.  But you know what?  These celebrity chefs are known for a reason.  It is not because they make crappy boring food.  No....it is because they pay their dues and have worked tirelessly at their craft.  They are True professionals.  This is why a Giada restaurant, a Bobby Flay restaurant, and even a Guy Fieri restaurant all have good food.  I must admit, I am not a fan of Fieri's, but I will not bash his restaurant because of that....the restaurant is good.  The best out of the bunch is Giada.  Forget the crazy snooty reviews....just listen to a person that knows good food and is not too proud to admit it.  I hope Giada does not get down because of some of the raging snootier reviews and instead continues to listen to the people that actually appreciate fine dining and actually PAY for the food they get.    All of the snooty reviewers need to take a jump out of the windows at Giada and get a good view of the Bellagio fountain before they hit Mario, Dora the Explorer, some Minions, Spiderman, a couple of guitar players, and ultimately the concrete on the way down.",

    "text": "This is probably the worst fine dining restaurant I have ever been to.  First, the hostesses are so snotty and rude.  We arrived for a 6:00 PM reservation.  I approached the hostess stand and gave my name.  The hostess looked at me like I had two heads.  What's up with that? Next, we each had a martini in our hands that we brought up from downstairs.  The only thing the hostess said to us was \"you can't bring those in here.\"  I understand that but no welcome, hello, glad you're here, your table will be ready shortly, nothing but \"you can't bring those in here.\"  So, we finished our martini's.  As we were being lead to our table, I asked for a window seat.  Hostess said ok, sure but walked us right to a very small table that was the furthest away from the window.  I could tell she was not going to budge so we accepted the table.    Next, we ordered the chicken cacciatore for two because we had seen a Food network episode where Giada cooked that at her place in Italy and it looked so wonderful.  What a joke!  The \"chicken\" was the size of a very small cornish game hen.  The leg was the size of an average person's thumb.  I'm not exaggerating.  There was nothing on the dish but this tiny, dry, sad bird.  The waiter even came out before the chicken was served and strongly suggested we get a side.  So we got the asparagus.  So, to break it down, a bottle of wine (one of the least expensive on the menu-nothing extravagant), one tiny, dry bird, and some asparagus cost $250 + tip.  This restaurant is very beautiful but the food and service do not live up to the ambiance and price point of the restaurant.  Will never be back and will highly suggest you spend your $$$$ elsewhere.  There are many high end restaurants in Las Vegas that know how to treat customers and that serve fantastic food.",

    "text": "I tend to be a star inflater, and so although 3 stars might seem low, let me remind you that Yelp deems 3 stars \"A-OK.\" I can't think of a better term to describe our experience at Giada. It was fine.   The overall service was a little awkward and not as smooth or polished as you'd expect from this calibre of restaurant. We were greeted pleasantly and then asked if we'd like a \"tour\" of the restaurant. This was basically our hostess parading us quickly past three or four prep stations on our way to our table, narrating them rapidly as she hurried down the line, tossing perfunctory explanations over her shoulder to us. We didn't even have time to look as we walked. It felt a little like a 5th grade oral report. It was whatever, but let's not call it a \"tour.\" The server was a little bit slow and probably should have picked up on some non-verbal cues--the ole \"craning my neck and wondering where the F you are because it's 10:15 PM and I am hangry\" thing. I think he was trying to be respectful and not intrusive, but it felt a little bit negligent at times.  The food was hit or miss, and overall, pretty forgettable. The only things that were excellent were the orzo meatballs and the salume pizzetta. The caponata was too sweet, the clams casino were fishy and salty (I guess that's a matter of taste), and the arugula salad can be skipped. I enjoyed the lemon spaghetti, although my wife found it too lemony, and the buccatini was spicy, but otherwise not complex or deep.   The view and decor are really something to marvel at, though. Too many Vegas restaurants are tucked away in a dark room inside a casino. Spectacular view of Bellagio Fountains, warm ambiance, comfortable chairs.   Glad we went and tried it out. Probably won't be back. When there are so many exceptional restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, I'd have a hard time justifying paying this much for an \"A-OK\" experience.",

The shrimps with the spghetti were the biggest I've ever had.  When time for dessert a little trolley comes by and you pick what you want.  Was with a party of six and we all loved the total dinning experience.  We will be back for sure.  I hear lunch is outstanding as well.

Everyone besides him was just fine, - the atmosphere was very cool and the decor was nice. We thoroughly enjoyed that.  - everything is a la carte. We each ordered a soft drink, a salad, two appetizers, each had an entree ($3), and had four of the small desserts they bring around on their dessert cart. Oh, and Sabrina ordered a coffee. I believe our bill was $240. A bit expensive for what it was. Ok, very expensive for what it was. - The length of time between our appetizers and entrees was way too long. We all agreed to that.

    "text": "I love Giada and have been waiting for her to open a restaurant for years. I was extremely excited to hear she opened one in Vegas. What a disappointment though. :( we went for lunch because the Yelp reviews were so low. First, I felt the lunch menu was lacking pasta options. I really wanted pasta but I didn't want lasagna or gnocchi. Based on the waitress recommendation I ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese with prosciutto and the fried zucchini rings. The sandwich was ok. Nothing special and certainly not worth $23. The zucchini was also ok. There was mound of it and honestly too much. It needs a dip, maybe an aioli. Boring on its own and too salty. I tried the lasagna that my friend ordered and was glad I didn't order it as the pasta was soggy. It didn't taste like anything special either. I've had better other places that are less elegant for sure. I tried my friends pizza and it was good, I'd say the best thing at the table. I wish I had ordered it. I'm not cheap but I do have to say that a $6 iced tea for lunch is a little steep. The tea wasn't anything special. The decor of the restaurant was great. Very Giada. I don't regret trying it but I won't be back nor will I recommend it to anyone. We ate at several other restaurants in Vegas that were much better...Mesa Grill, Mon Ami Gabi.",

Now the food.  We only sampled giadas favorite platter, a $50.00 sampling of sweet peppers, stuffed dates, and the antipasto assortment of calamari, ahi crostini, etc., and while nothing was bad, nothing really crushed it for us either.  The bread presentation is a lot of sizzle and less steak, even with the fresh rosemary bread they bake in a ramekin.  Probably not fair to rate a restaurant on one appetizer plate but this was all we ordered.  I was really struck by the attention to detail everywhere.  Servers looking at glasses to see if they needed polishing, bartenders wiping off the side of the glass because a bit of foam trickled down, etc..They have assembled a terrific team, and this is obviously not the case of a celebrity chef just stamping their name on the front door, but a labor of love by an obvious perfectionist who has invested a bunch of blood, sweat, and tears and isnt about to let someone else screw it up.",

    "text": "What a lovely addition to the strip. The restaurant is very wide open and spacious but the decor and small details make it feel cozy. I absolutely love it, it's all in the details! The ladies all wear white eyelet dresses while the men wear checkered shirts with a navy tie. Not too bougie but just right. Up the escalators and to the left there is a small photo booth to mark your experience, take note!  We came for lunch. We tried the white and red sangria to start, red is better.  The meat and cheeses can be made into a platter, the $65 platter allowed all 7 of us to have a good portion of three cheeses and four types of cured meats. The house bread and pesto sauce is an honorable mention because we requested more pesto to dip our pizza crusts into! We got the mortadella, carbonara and salumi picante. No complaints. Each pizza is enough for one hungry person or two not so hungry people.  The salads were a hit or miss though, as everyone loved the arugula salad and no one wanted anything to do with the kale salad. It ended up in a box to go and then someone's fridge and probably in the trash.  For sandwiches, the muffuletta and lobster roll was a favorite, but the tenderloin sliders were dry.  Lastly we shared the baked pasta which is a lasagna, good enough for two people and it's highly recommended. I only wished I left more room for it!  Since it was my birthday, 6 baked cookies were brought to the table. Not sure if it is on the dessert menu but the chocolate chip, lemon and chocolate peanut butter are just fabulous! Definitely coming for dinner to try the evening menu.  Oh, and the crowd is 95% women in their 40s+",

Lo and behold, we decided to have breakfast the next morning.  We were lucky to get a window table, even without a reservation. The restaurant is beautiful. We were doubly-lucky to get a prime view of the Bellagio fountains.  For breakfast we had the Polenta en Cocotte, and the Contadina breakfast. The polenta was perfect, with just the right kind of sausage. Sometimes Italian sausage has too many herbs and spices for me. This was just right. The Contadina breakfast was similar to your typical American scrambled eggs and toast breakfast, but it came with a tasty accompaniment of spinach and sundried tomatoes.  We enjoyed the thick breakfast toast. Our server gave us a condiment platter of cream cheese/lemon zest, walnut/chocolate nut butter and raspberry jam. All were tasty toppers for our toast.   We also ordered a very tasty bloody mary.  Service was prompt and reliable. Prices are not cheap; but portions are just right. If you are looking to splurge for a different kind of breakfast, consider stopping by Giada's place.",

    "text": "I came into the experience not wanting to like it but I was dead wrong. We sat at the bar and two aspexts made this an incredible meal experience: the food and the bartender, Giovanni. Let me be clear, Giovanni is the shit. Not only was he a pleasant bartender who didn't intrude too much while keeping his professional and congenial demeanor, he REALLY knew the menu. Hats off to you bud.  The food on the other hand was...sofa king good. I love octopus and this was by far the best octopus I've had in a long while. Great portion and, more importantly, the most succulent octopus I've had that I can remember. So many places do octopus and just don't do the guy justice by overcooking or charring the hell out of the meat, then giving you tiny tentacles. This octopus was SO GOOD.   We also had the duck prosciutto which we were worried might be tough, since many in house Prosciuttos turn out tough. No no no, this was soooooooo tender, with perfect accompaniments to offer little zings of acid or salt or crunch here and there.   Thanks to Giovanni, we finished off our meal with the lemon souffle. Perfect. Incredible, light, comforting, bright finish to our meal.   I travel to all the big food cities in the US for work and this meal stood out for my 2015. Hands down I'll be back with clients!",

    "text": "My husband and I had reservations for Giada's at 7:15 on Wednesday. We got dressed up and  were so excited for our dinner date; however, it was ruined by our rude waiter, Diego. At first, he was kind of nice; however, when we decided not to try the tasting menu,he seemed offended and developed a rude attitude, and it was all downhill from there. He barely checked on us during our meal, and he never refilled our drinks. Moreover, my husband ordered a cappuccino during the dessert course, which he never received. When Diego finally did come over to check on us (after we had already received our desserts), my husband told him that we were going to a show at 9:30 and asked for the check. For some reason, this seemed to offend Diego, who got snippy with my husband and said, \"Well, don't you want to enjoy the experience? Never mind, I'll get the check\".    I felt as though we were not welcome at all and were treated poorly. The manager walked around to various tables and spoke with guests. However, she never came over to our table, which didn't surprise me, considering that we weren't VIPs or anything. Our credit card worked  just as well as any of the other guests' cards at the restaurant.   Honestly, I'm not sure if we will ever go back there. Even though the food was amazing (especially the mortadella pizette, bacon-wrapped dates, bread, lemon spaghetti, blackberry lime tiramisu, and Giada's signature lemon ricotta cookie) and the atmosphere was beautiful, the experience was ruined by the very pretentious attitude of our waiter. Despite that fact, we still gave him a 20% tip.",

Half-way through our waiting, we asked one of the ladies in the front desk how much longer is the wait, and she very rudely told us that it'll be about an hour. So, a little over an hour later, we sat down and ordered our food. We asked our waitress to put the fruits on the waffle on the side for my nephew, and when it came, it was not on the side. No big deal, we just did it ourselves. But guess what, the waffle does not taste good! Everything we ordered: Strawberry Polenta Waffle, G's Baked Pasta, Breakfast American, and Assorted Cookie Platter were either quite bland, not delicious, or not worth the price. As a local, it's really challenging to eat at the Strip because a lot of the restaurants serve food that aren't delicious, and the price are ridiculous. And then, the customer service we received was not good at all. As a fan of Giada and Italian food, we had a terrible experience in this restaurant and we will not be back again!",

    "text": "Confession, Giada is hands down my favorite celebrity chef. So when I found out that she was opening her first restaurant I was super excited to try it.   A friend is visiting Vegas and wanted to check out The Linq. We had already had dinner so we decided it was still a great opportunity to check out Giada for a few drinks.   The restaurant was beautiful with lots of attention to detail. And that's where the good ended. We walked right past the hostess stand since they looked busy amongst themselves. We figured we just wanted to grab a drink at the bar so we didn't bother interrupting the hostesses talking to each other. Once we got inside one of the hostesses came up to us and asked if we had a reservation, so we told her we just wanted to get some drinks at the bar. Apparently there is such a thing as a waitlist for the bar (keep in mind it wasn't even full.) We were told that if we gave them our phone number they would call us in about 20-25 minutes once something opens up. Guess what? They never called!!!!  To say we were disappointed with the level of service and professionalism would be an understatement. Really it's just plain rude. I guess it's my fault for expecting that a restaurant of someone who seems so down to earth would be so unwelcoming. Giada, thanks to your staff you have lost a longtime fan.   It wasn't a total loss though, luckily we found the Bound by Salvatore bar at the casino level of the Cromwell. Great service and super delicious cocktails!!!",

Had a reservation at 7:45 pm for 3 on Tuesday 10/18 and was not seated until 8:15 pm. We had arrived early (20 min) hoping to get in a little earlier than our reservation, and watched several 5+ groups, a foursome who arrived after us with a 7:45 reservation and a twosome with an 8 pm reservation get seated before us. It was a special Anniversary dinner which had been mentioned upon our reservation, but obviously didn't matter when we arrived. We asked about our table 3 times and the manager came to speak with us the third time who said he would personally seat us. A few minutes later when he was seating us he told us he had ordered an antipasti tray for us since we had waited so long. I informed him that one of us has a severe gluten allergy and it would need to be gluten free. Fortunately he was able to separate the gluten items before the plate arrived. Although that was a nice gesture, it could have gone horribly wrong since HE ordered it without asking us about food allergies! After we ordered, it took quite a while for our meals to come. While we waited, the waiter told us that management was going to speak to the kitchen because it was taking sooooooooooooo long. When our meals did arrive, they were barely warm. My salmon was also dry on the outside from sitting out but not completely cooked in the center. We had waited so long that we did not send it back. Our waiter had not delivered our meals, but checked on us later when we were about halfway done with our meals. Although I wanted dessert, I was not willing to order anything other than a special coffee for fear of having to wait even more. Just before the check, I asked to speak with the manager. I explained that we did not want to penalize our waiter for the kitchen's problems, and he said he was sorry and that they did not expect the volume of diners they had. That was simply not True, since they only take reservations. The Manager did NOT offer any compensation, so unfortunately, the waiter's tip was 15% as opposed to 20%.  The atmosphere is nice. Our table was beside a window, but not the Ballagio fountain view as boasted on the website. Not too noisy given the crowd. Appetizing menu offerings. My husband's salad was on the large size while our entree's were small given the price.  DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!   Sorry Giada....I got no love for your restaurant...and I was sooooo looking forward to a really nice meal for our splurge dinner in Vegas. MANAGEMENT SHOULD HAVE ADJUSTED OUR BILL!  Our best meal of the week was at Kabuki off the strip! And I'm not into raw fish.",

Especially of note was the soup... $10.00 for a portion that couldn't have been more than 3/4 of a cup.  It wasn't lobster bisque where talking about here, it was pasta fagiole.  90% broth with a 5 or 6 white beans.  I am not exaggerating either.   Service is where work is especially needed.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation of our party of 8.  Since we were early, we had no problem waiting in the bar for our table.  They assured us that our table was getting ready.  45 minutes later, 30 minutes past our reservation, we were finally seated after several inquiries and several reassurances that the table was almost ready.  What the ????   And to add insult to injury our server in the bar was a dingbat.  Our dinner server was adequate though.    If it ever was acknowledged by the staff that we had to wait 30 minutes for table, I wouldn't be so upset.  After all, I know things happen beyond control, but the inconvenience to us was never acknowledged.  An offer of an comp appetizer or drink while we waited would have minimized our irritation.",

She has been wishing to go since it opened and the whole experience did not disappoint and made her birthday one to remember. We made 6:30 dinner reservations and we were seated when we arrived at a nice table in a corner where we had a good view of the Bellagio fountains. Our server, Amber, was great! She allowed us all the time we needed to decide on what we wanted and gave great suggestions. Yes, the portions are small. Amber explained this to start. The menu is set up as courses and Amber gave suggestions on how to order from it. We ordered three andipastis (the bacon wrapped dates were tasty and the gorgonzola with pear honey was delicious.) We all ordered a salad (my sister and I each had the arugula salad and my mom looked like the winner with the caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes.) My mom had the salmon, sister had the signature spaghetti and I had the tortellini-all excellent. We finished our meal with a tiramisu cheesecake. We left full and happy from a wonderful experience. The manager stopped by to wish my mom a happy birthday and upon my mom's request, provided her with the salmon recipe from the tasting menu as a birthday gift. Reviews who complain about portion sizes must not had read the reviews before going and probably should hit a buffet next time. The one small complaint I agree with is the music level. It stinks to ask the person next to you to repeat what they said because the music was too loud (but beautiful live music.) P.S. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a little drink treat!",

The sweeping views, from just a few floors up, overlooking Bellagio and Caesars were just fabulous.  Regarding food and service, I would say very good, but not excellent.  Not quite worth the hype, and not really worth the money to me.  I am not sure I would return for dinnner, instead I think I might choose breakfast, where I get the same views.  All the appetizers were wonderful, however I found my chicken to be just a touch to the dry side.  Dessert was also quite good.  Do I think the restaurant is worth trying, absolutely, but to have such a huge demand on reservations, and have them so hard to get, I simply don't think the restaurant lives up to all hype.",

We sampled the antipasti platter, pea and pancetta tortellini, chicken cacciatore - all delish! We even got to meet Giada herself - she was so personable and sincere. Love every detail she has hand selected for her new spot!",

    "text": "Giada Restaurant The manager said: \"Yelp it\"! So I am. On Wednesday April 12th we dined at Giada restaurant after having reservations two month in advance. We had the reservations for 7:30pm and we were there at the exact time (there were 2 couples, my husband and my friend and her husband; both men are diabetics who take medications and need to eat on time for their medications). When we got there, the hostess was impolite and told us unpleasantly that there's a 10 to 15 minutes wait. (If we can be on time, so can they). We ended up waiting for 26 minutes to be seated! We sat down and waited for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the waitress bothered to acknowledge us. While in the next table, there were 4 young women who were treated with 5-6 waitresses serving them nonstop! The food was not good and the service was very poor. Even for a glass of water, we had to wait a while. At the end, after we paid and asked to speak to a manager, he told us that it is common to be waiting for half an hour and he simply said \"just yelp it!\" with no explanations or apologies. To top it all off, I ended up throwing up all night with a major stomach discomfort, and this all during our vacation. I was extremely disappointed and shocked, since I have been longing for two month for this evening. Giada is a respectable chef and it surprised us that this experience was so negative.",

We are celebrating our 2 year marriage!   The decor and layout was nice. The chairs were super comfortable and I love the theme of the restaurant.   The service was mediocre. Maybe our waiter had a rough day but didn't go over the tasting menu. Just gave us our water, then when it was time to order he said \"Ready?\" I prefer interaction with the waiter where they talk to us a bit about the menu. Especially at a place like this.   My wife got the risotto and I got the spaghetti. We both loved our dishes. However, this might have been the first time where we both looked and said where is the rest of our food. Typically Italian restaurants are pricey therefore we rarely go to Italian restaurants when we can make it at home.   I'd recommend this place just because we are huge fans and I did like my spaghetti. Did feel as if everything had lemon in it. We did receive a nice anniversary plate which made it special :)",

BUT THERES ONLY ONE PASTA DISH ON THE MENU. ONE. I really felt that the menu is lacking in many ways. this is vegas, we don't come here for salads and sandwiches for lunch, especially if we're already willing to pay the price to eat at Giada. Nevertheless, my sandwich was pretty good, I subbed out the fontina for buffalo mozzarella and they were pretty accommodating.  I didn't bother getting a pizza because the portions looks small. my sandwich came with flash fried zucchini, it was interesting but i rather have truffle fries or polenta fries with marinara something.",

We were seated right next to the busing station. I was sitting with my chair pressed up to it. We noticed there were a few tables that were vacant at the window. When our waiter came to our table my boyfriend asked if we could be moved to a window seat like we had asked for. He graciously said he would check and we were immediately moved to a window seat. I am not sure why we had to go through all that but things went smooth from that point. We both tried the tasting menu at the suggestion of our waiter. It was awesome ! We loved everything ! The portions are small but as you move from course to course it makes sense. Loved the look of the entire place . We each tried 2 different cocktails and loved them both. I would definitely go back again despite our initial seating issue.",

This was not made clear and there was no attempt to accommodate us.   More importantly, the food was mediocre with incredibly overpriced small portions. We got a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and pastas. Even something as simple and classic as pasta carbonara was actually labeled bad by my companions. The sandwich orders only came with half a sandwich and the meatball appetizer, for example, came with 5 meatballs the size of a large grape or olive. The servers were friendly but very slow and gave no insight into the menu. When ordering those meatballs as an app for 5 guys, we asked if we should get 2...she says \"oh well there are 5,\" as if it was a sufficient portion. All of that for $50+ per person. We spent the whole meal talking about how much better the Caesars bacchanal buffet was.   On the plus size the space is beautiful.",

Having said that Giada's is hardly \"fine dining\".  Our table was in the bar area.   We ordered our appetizers and thought they were ok, but nothing really to write home about.  Once dinner arrived, they brought not only 1 wrong order, but 2.  The waiter put it in the system incorrectly.  They ended up comping both.    The saving grace was the dessert cart.   Putting service aside because every now and then a restaurant will fail on service for a very similar price and views (Bellagio fountains), the food at Scarpetta blows Giada's out of the water.

    "text": "An amazing dining experience! The place is brand new, but there doesn't seem to be any kinks in the system. We were able to walk in on a late Sunday afternoon. The entire wait staff was attentive and knowledgable in the menu.  Not sure why the Yelp map shows the location near the Sands Expo when this is on the corner of Flamingo and the Strip. We had a table over-looking Flamingo which was good since the tables on the corner got the setting Sun heat at our time of dining. A walk by the antipasti case as you are walking in lets you know of things to come.  A few minutes after sitting down, we get the fresh baked focaccia and bread sticks. We ordered the taster menu and started with a platter of antipasti - Giada's favorites. It had bacon wrapped dates, eggplant rollatini, stuffed peppers, and a few crostinis. The wife and daughter got the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and I got the rigatoni vegetable bolognese (to be different) as seconds. If their shrimp was any bigger, you'd think they were lobster tails! For thirds we ordered Farrotto with Fava and Morels (daughter), Seared Salmon with Summer Succotash (wife) and Sicilian Roasted Lamb (me). This came with family style smashed potatoes and sweet corn with spicy Italian sausage. The food was amazing in presentation and taste and cooked to our preferences. For dessert, we received a plate with a tiramisu, strawberry/tomato tart and cookies. We've seen Giada do her Strawberry/Tomato recipe on Food Network and it was delicious! The waiter, Joseph, also brought our daughter a birthday dessert of three scoops of gelato. This is the type of wait-staff that could develop their own clientele of regulars.  The whole dining experience was unrushed and comfortable. People watching on the Strip is always interesting!  One odd thing - while at Giada's, all three of our iPhones were drained of their power at an alarming rate!",

    "text": "Very Disappointed!!   We went to Giada's for my wife's 49th Birthday while in Vegas.  My wife and I were both looking forward to having dinner here and were not surprised by the high prices.  We expected it, since we were eating at a place owned by a famous Chef'.   The restaurant was elegant with a pretty decent view of the strip,  However, we were very surprised by the poor quality of our dinner.  Seriously Disappointed!! .    Our filets and lobster ravioli was seriously short of our expectations.  While we expected the small sized portion, which is typical with finer dining (you know, less is more), the flavor did not not make up for it.  Both of our filets were burned on one side and was topped by one small ravioli.  Yes, that's correct, one ravioli.  The ravioli was very dry and hard around the edges, where I had to use my knife to cut it.  You would think at $56 dollars (ala carte) you would expect it to be perfect!  I just could figure...The only way to ruin a filet is by over cooking it....They did.  Service was okay, I say just okay because our waitress was having trouble with the other wait staff. A little disagreement over using each others menus.  The service staff need a lot more training it seems.  Our small table for two quickly became over crowded. as the dish (extra dish) piled up,  With the raised place mat, bread dish, and glasses, there was little room for anything else.  Hence, once the bread tray arrived, it didn't easily fit on the table.  So picture what it looked like when the bus boy didn't remove empty dishes,  I was forced to start stacking dishes on my table and had to ask to have them removed.  .  They did bring my wife a very tiny dessert and sparkling wine because it was her birthday.  However, I think it was more that we complained to the manager, who told us we should have told him or the waitress sooner.    The interesting thing was that the bill included an Iphone to take a survey on the service we received.  One of the questions was \"Did the manager visit you during your meal?\" Since he didn't show up until after we had received our bill and completed the survey, I said \"no.\"   Funny, after I advised him of the poor quality of food, the manager asked if I had already completed the survey.  The irony was he never offered any way to make up for our poor experience.  My opinion, it was because I had already filled out the survey.  So, after settling our $200 bill,  we agreed we wouldn't be returning to Giada's on our next trip to Vegas.  Especially since Vegas has plenty of great restaurants to choose from during our four to six visits a year.",

Above the food, though, is the service. The service is EXCELLENT, especially the main man, Radoslav. If you're ever at the Cromwell and want first rate Italian dining with great service, definitely stop by at Giada.",

    "text": "We settled on Giada's for our 9th anniversary dinner.  We are big food network fans, as well as hers, and were very excited about it.  I made the reservations months in advance, and expressed the importance of the night to us, as well as our request for window seating for the view.  I also called to confirm the opentable reservation, and to express in more detail my request  for the window seat. We arrived an hour early, let them know we were there, and sat in the bar for a drink and appetizer.  When they sat us at our reservation time, it was in a tiny back area with a window to nothing that had blinds we had to open ourselves.  We are not complainers at restaurants, but I felt given the special night, I wanted to have the experience there that I planned.  When the hostess came back with our menus, I asked her if it would be OK if we waited for another table, as we had requested a view.  She first said that we could wait if we wanted, but that people were lingering in that area so that's why they sat us here.  My husband and I started to discuss whether we wanted to wait or not, she then went on to say that they just sat everyone in that area, and it would be quite some time.  ?  Really?  At that point we gave up.  How did they just seat everyone there when I had requested that area months in advance?  Our waiter was good, but the food was completely average, which was another disappointment.  Our conclusion at the end of our evening, it's a tourist trap... and it worked.",

She is a sweetheart.  The panini turkey sammich was good, although all the portions were relatively small.  Giada is a tiny, super petite person so I'm wondering if we should take the hint!  The muffaletta was GREAT!  One of the best I've ever had outside of New Orleans.  Chocolate tiramisu was so good, as were the 3 types of cookies.  Our waiter was very funny, sweet, down to earth.  I think from France.  All of the employees were kind and helpful.  It's a bit pricey, but it is a beautiful place and I don't have one complaint.  Sangria was really good.  White peach bellini,  meh.",

    "text": "Absolutely outstanding! The food was stellar. You don't go into an Italian restaurant expecting to eat the best filet you've ever had, but that's exactly what happened to me.   The flavors of everything else was on the mild side which I personally liked a lot. If your sense of taste is strong, you'll love it here, if you need totally over the top flavors, it may seem less full than you'd expect.  The ambiance was great. Nice views, good lighting level, good sound level, just great.   The best part though was the service. Tim was our waiter, and I'd highly recommend him to anyone. He was simply the best waiter I've ever had. I'm allergic to many cheeses (parmesan, romano, ricotta, bleu, etc.) I know, great choice to go Italian with that lot, right?   If you have any allergies though, Tim is your guy. He knew the menu inside and out and had the chef tailor the dishes outside of the steak to my needs. It turned out perfectly!  I've been to many 5-star restaurants and I think this is very good by those standards.",

We were seated by the windows and the weather was actually nice enough that they opened them up once the sun went down. What a treat.

Over priced for the value delivered. The table next to us sent the food back 3 times. Our meal was nothing special. The insult at the came when we were told if you wanted the tasting menu for the night ( which we asking for to give to a friend who is a fan of giadas), we had to pay an additional $50. What a horrible sign of greed. This maybe cost 2, maybe 3 dollars to produce in mass. Won't be returning to this establishment or the Cromwell hotel. Do everyone a favor and stop making the food network stars richer and give your support to the local establishments that are really putting the effort in to gain your business.",

We were excited to be returning as it was about a year ago that we ate at Giada's. We enjoyed the experience-both food and level of service. We even ordered the tasting menu and ordered a bottle of wine. It was definitely  worth the splurge.   However, our second visit wasn't what we expected. We were seated at a window location, which we appreciated. We decided on ordering off the menu this time around. But also chose a bottle of Pinot Gris to go with our dinner. Our appetizers came quickly- we ordered charred octopus and grilled sweet peppers. Loved every bite of it. However, our entrees did not quite arrive in a timely fashion. I think it was about 25-30minutes before our server had informed us there was a mistake on the restaurant's side. Our bill was paid for by table next to us, and therefore closed out. So that explained the delay, but we still waited another 15 minutes or so for the food.  I ordered  the spaghettini with shrimp. The noodles were cooked al dente, but the sauce was to creamy and overpowered the taste of the dish. Not as great as my first experience (especially for the wait). My husband ordered the Branzino (grilled white fish). Which he enjoyed and I also liked the seasoning and flakiness of the fish.    The dessert we ordered was a chocolate espresso cake. This was decadent and probably the best part of our meal.   We were offered a 10% discount on our meal for the delay. We were appreciative for that gesture.    In total we were there for about 2-1/2 hours. I wasn't really impressed this visit and may not be visiting agin the next time we are in town.  Especially Not for the amount we would like to pay for fine dining.   The opening was excellent and it set the bar high for the restaurant.  No matter what, I still love Giada and her cooking.",

A kid could make it better, to be honest.  It was beyond bland, lacked any flavor and not even served hot.  Olive Garden serves better pasta and you can buy a grocery store pasta sauce that is much, much more flavorful.  This came as a shock as this is the Giada's restaurant!   2. Service: Incredibly slow.  We waited over ONE HOUR for our entrees to be served! No waiter came to give us any updates. Once they did arrive, a few dishes were not even warm.  We ordered 2 cocktails which took so long to serve that we finished eating our meal in that time. After no word from them about our drinks, we inquired about them only for the to remember. We proceeded to tell them to just cancel it because we were already ready to pay our bill and leave.  After he acknowledged that, a few min later, someone came running with our drinks...probably so they could still charge us for them.  But we again told them no, we already cancelled them because we are done eating now.  Overall, very disappointing experience.  If you want good Italian food, do not come here.  However, if you want average/below average but to be in a place with beautiful ambiance and views, then come and enjoy your time here.",

The smell of wood burning fireplace can be perceived from the first floor, at first I thought that it was a nice touch but the smell was so powerful that it was all I could smell through the meal. Also my clothing was impregnated with the smell of smoke for hours after eating there.. It really needs a better ventilation system. Now, the experience.. While walking to the table I noticed rest of food on the floor that stayed there until we left. The table had crumbs when I sat down.. I had to ask to change my cutlery since it was also dirty, glasses with water spots.  Our server Bill was very attentive and nice, however, during the course of our meal we had several other people delivering our food with less than qualified skills to serve. The menu was very basic, disappointed for such a renowned chef. We ordered some cheese to start that was pretty good, for my main course I ordered the lasagna with arugula salad on the side and my friend the lobster roll with zucchini scapecce (that tasted like oil and nothing else..). Lasagna was very bland.. I asked for salt that took forever to get to the table.. The lobster roll? same, no taste at all. What ashamed! I didn't finish my plate.. Then I decided to ask for dessert so I can have something in my stomach for the rest of the day. \"Someone\" (not our server) cleaned up the table and I noticed he didn't pick up some arugula leaves that fell from my plate to my placemat.. So when he came back with the dessert he put the dessert IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE instead of in front of me (since my placemat was dirty)!! My friend started laughing at the situation and I was speechless.. The tiramisu was nothing extraordinary.. And my friend's coffee was ok... I looked around and although the place itself is pretty the little care with cleaning and attention to detail was not to the standard of a famous chef's restaurant  .. Food on the floor, dusty.. I never thought I was gonna listen to Aerosmith (which I love) in an Italian restaurant?? For a moment I thought I was eating at the Hard Rock Cafe..The music selection was like they picked someone's Ipod and played it! Overpriced for the whole experience.. For that price? I rather go to Nora's on flamingo!! And I won't smell like CAMP FIRE when I leave..",

Probably the most difficult part of the dining experience was getting a reservation - My husband called two weeks prior to my birthday and they told him only thing available was after 10:00 PM - not acceptable - He did manage to get in a bit earlier that I would have liked (5:15) but was glad that we got to try it.  When you walk in you see a plethora of fresh foods in a spotless glass refrigerator case and as well  an open wood fire stove with several little red pots inside.  Humm I wonder what those are? Fresh pastas are also hanging in view ready for their 3 minute hot bath before serving.   Service starts with a bread plate...Here comes the little red pot of hot freshly baked rosemary bread served with savory bread crisps and sticks and nice dipping and sprinkling assortment that includes pesto and lemon butter.  You will want another pot o bread for sure.  Nothing better than fresh pasta - My daughter had one of Giada's signature pastas, a nest of angle hair pasta flanked by two tender jumbo shrimp - She did not leave even a speck of pasta on the plate.  I had parpadella with pork - fresh - sauce like my grandma used to make and wonderfully tender shreds of pork.  My husband had the surf and turf -  The turf was an excellently prepared fillet of beef cooked to perfection - He was less satisfied with the turf that was a crab ravioli.  He wanted a more traditional surf maybe more substance than a single ravioli.  His was also served with sauted asparagus and snap peas which he really enjoyed.  We were very full from our meal but did indulge in some lemon icebox cookies and peanut butter and raspberry cookies - a satisfying end to a very nice meal.  In addition service was excellent - Wine list was very nice and appropriately priced for the overall price point of the restaurant.",

    "text": "I've seen the Food Network shows, I've thought incessantly about how she could eat pasta and olive oil all day long and stay thin, and I've read about her too many times on celebrity blogs/sites.   I'm never excited to dine at celebrity chef establishments. Guy Fieri, Gordon Ramsay etc...are douches. Michael Mina (see me review of his namesake restaurant at the Bellagio) was a total waste of time. The track records of celebrity chefs are not exactly stellar.   Finally, after months of not looking at Giada's, I decide to go for a date night with the hubs largely because I absolutely love how the place looks when you drive towards the Cromwell with the green vegetation. Since then, I requested to come back with friends for my birthday dinner here as I loved it so much. Giada has proven the TV cook curse can be broken.   Firstly, the place was outstanding due to a wonderful waiter (that we got both times we were there)! Diego...a wonderful man from Italy who was attentive, polite, hilarious and just literally the best waiter I have ever ever had in my entire life.   Then, the food...Giada likes to squeeze citrus on her dishes. Normally, that would have generated a barf response from me. But you know what..it was done right. Just a smidgen of citrus was beautiful. I never thought I would say that.   I've ordered the following:  1) Artichoke Arancini - I could eat like 18 of these. So freaking good. Fried rice, artichoke balls. Oh loveliness 2) Bucatini with a tomato - citrus sauce - so simple and delicious. You just don't feel like you ate a bowl of spaghetti...feels so much more sophisticated and just...different. I thought that the noodles here was even better than the famous Scarpetta spaghetti 3) The vegan main was chard wrapped brown rice and tofu with a curry seasoning (?). Made no sense and sounded so awful on the menu especially at an Italian place. My husband made the order and I was seething with anger at having to pay good money to eat something that sounded awful. Why they would describe the dish that way on the menu is beyond me? Because it is one of the MOST DELICIOUS things I've ever eaten! So savory, so smooth and just wonderful.   I never did try the desserts but the dessert cart was pretty impressive. When we had our friends with us the second time, our friends ordered the lamb, octopus and a bunch of other carnivorous fare and enjoyed it with glee. So I'd say the full menu is pretty darn good.   But the special icing of Giada - our wonderful Diego.   This is one of the places I think it's worth spending money on a meal for. Giada, you have me as a fan.",

    "text": "Giada may be many things, but subtle isn't one of them.  Her eponymous restaurant juts out over the Las Vegas Strip more prominently than her cleavage juts out of my HDTV whenever the boob tube is tuned to the Food Network.  (See what I did there?  \"Boob tube\"!)  Anyways, now that I got my requisite joke about Giada's cleavage out of the way, I can finally talk about my brunch!  It was pretty great, actually.  I was joined by a few friends at Giada on a Sunday morning.  The place is right off the casino at The Cromwell, with a dramatic escalator entrance that takes you up to the hostess stand, which doubles as a gift shop selling mountains of Giada-related paraphernalia.  (Like I said, Giada isn't subtle.)  We were quickly whisked into the dining room, which was gorgeous and has a stunning panorama of the Strip.  Lots of light and cozy furniture make you want to sit back and relax for a while.  Pretty much everything from the napkins to the dishes is a shrine to Giada -- her name and image are ubiquitous.  Some might find this tacky, but, it was just tasteful enough that didn't bother me too much.  Brunch started with drinks.  My friends had mimosas but I decided to forgo the booze and had a cappuccino instead.    Next, we shared an assortment of breakfast pastries.  They were fine, but nothing in particular impressed me.  The donut-like pastry was dry.  I think my expectations might've been too high.  The real star of brunch was the salmon cake benedict, which was totally fabulous.  It was served with wilted spinach, piquillo peppers, poached eggs, prosecco hollandaise, and two thick slices of toast.  I don't think I'd ever had prosecco hollandaise before, and it was a light and delicious alternative to a heavy, run-of-the-mill hollandaise.  The salmon cakes were fresh and juicy, too.  I also enjoyed the assortment of spreads and sauces (including Nutella!) that came with the toast.  That was a unique touch.  All in all, I enjoyed my brunch at Giada.  I look forward to my next brunch here -- almost as much as I look forward to seeing her cleavage bursting through my television set.",

    "text": "I've watched Giada cook in her V-neck boob shirts on Food Network since Day 1. (So did all of my guy friends, but I don't think they were watching the cooking.) I was hoping for a great meal, but this place is one of the most disappointing ones I've had on the strip.  We weren't very hungry, so we kept the food small. We both had a different cocktail, both of which were tasty and strong. Standard Vegas-priced for $15 each.   Artichoke soup for $12. The soup was lukewarm and had a mealy- not creamy- consistency to it. Neither of us finished the soup. I felt disappointed.  I got the Tricolore salad ($17), which I didn't finish. Sounded delicious with pancetta, dates, kale, and a mess of other things... it just didn't taste good at all. I can't even put a finger on why it was not good, but this fatty did not finish this meal.  My friend got the spaghetti with prawns ($32, I think). That actually looked tasty, and I think other reviewers recommended it as well.   Atmosphere is quite nice here with subtle lighting, and the restaurant is broken up into a cocktail lounge area, bar, and actual dining area. For some reason they had the windows open when it was 60 degrees outside at night, so it was incredibly cold in there.  I'm sad to say this place is just overpriced and overrated hype.",

Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I like how this restaurant is small with more of an intimate feel. It has a great view, being on the corner with huge windows. The interior design is unique, well put together, and intriguing. I would love for my future kitchen to look like parts of the one in Giadas.

So if you're trying impress someone, definitely come here but expect to pay top $$$ for some slightly above average food.  Lobster Arancini - Tasty but it could have been hotter.  This tasted like a potato cake in ball form with lobster bites in it.  Had lots of potential but I wanted more of a hot crispy bite   Mashed Potatoes Side - It wasn't bad but come on, how great can mashed potatoes really be.  If you're debating between sides, try something unless you're really craving mashed potatoes   Veal - No complaints here, exactly what I expected a veal cooked Milanese style to be.  Nice and crispy with a sauce that's boss  Had 8:30 reservations but didn't get seated till 9-9:15 which was pretty annoying.",

    "text": "I went here because I am Giada fan. I had a Groupon as well. This restaurant had the most amazing decor. It was just beautiful. Even the hostesses wore these fancy white dresses. Everything was amazing except our waitress. I wonder if it was because everyone had a Groupon and she was grumpy about it.  We don't drink, so we asked if we could get another drink besides the free champagne. She said no, we asked her to give our champagne to the table behind us, she said she would, but we never saw her do it. She just seemed annoyed and impatient.  Anyways, you get the idea- now I'm gonna talk about the food. We went here for breakfast. For drinks, I ordered the Dolce Vita, it was sparkly and tasty. My mom ordered one of the juices- it tasted fresh. For my meal I ordered the frittata. It was delicious. It had tons of cheese and fresh tomatoes. Yum! My mom ordered eggs and spinach. The spinach was amazing, it was sauteed perfection! Her meal came with toast, so we got this adorable spice tray (that I want to buy). It had  coarse salt and ground pepper, along with Nutella, lemon butter, and raspberry jam. I tried them all and the lemon butter with jam was my favorite. I wish that we could have gotten a little bread basket since the frittata doesn't come with bread. The frittata is pretty huge and I was having a hard time finishing it- you could definitely share it. We also got a pastry. It was monkey bread made with a croissant and had chocolate in it. It was to die for. I kind of wish I had tried all the pasties for $15 instead of ordering the frittata!  Overall, this restaurant is beautiful, the food it's impeccable, and it feels like Giada could just walk out of the kitchen at any moment.  I took one star off because of the waitress, what a bummer.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch on my birthday with my mom and brother. I made reservations via Open Table, so of course, it was simple.   We had a moment before our table was ready, so I was excited to check out the photo booth. It's a very cool set up of having a built-in complimentary photo booth, except it is a very tight space and it's difficult to reach the screen and be situated when the session starts. It was also unfortunate for us that their printer was out of service that morning! Sad face! They do allow you to send the photos via e-mail, but the pixel quality is atrocious.  The restaurant is beautiful and the view of The Strip (and Bellagio fountains) is great. I love the open kitchen and the antipasti bar. We were given a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows, which was very nice. The chairs were comfortable, too.   We started with Orzo Meatballs with Parmesan Pomodoro ($15) and Burrata with Balsamic Salt ($12). The meatballs were tender and flavorful; very satisfying. The Burrata was also delicious; really creamy and great with that balsamic salt, EVOO, and micro arugula. Both fantastic Antipasti dishes. They also offer complimentary bread that appears to be baked in a similar fashion to pizza (it may be their pizza dough). It's served with a yummy pesto oil.  Lobster Roll ($35): Lemon Basil Aioli and Fried Capers. All sandwiches are served with Arugula Salad or Zucchini Scapecce. I chose the Zucchini Scapecce, but was served the salad, so our server graciously brought a small plate of scapecce to the table. It was a great error because I truly enjoyed the salad AND the scapecce! They were delicious alone and with my sandwich. The sandwich is open-faced and stacked with scrumptious lobster meat. The mixture was so tasty!  Venetian Panino ($18): Turkey, Gruyere, Fontina, whole mustard, and Peppadew. This panini sandwich was also well-made and delicious. It not entirely exciting, so I probably wouldn't order it over all the other menu selections. My mom really enjoyed it though!  G's Baked Pasta of the Day ($24): The lasagna had layers of eggplant as well as your usual suspects. This was really, really good lasagna. I love the addition of eggplant layers to make it a bit more healthy.   Chocolate Tiramisu ($8): Chocolate Zabiaone and espresso-soaked ladyfingers. Tiramisu is one of my absolute favorite desserts and this is seriously one of the best tiramisu I've ever had the pleasure of eating. They also wrote a very nice \"Happy Birthday\" message on the plate.  Espresso Nocciolato ($9): Lavazza Gran Riserva, Nutella, whipped cream, toasted hazelnuts, and a light dusting of cocoa powder. This was really tasty and a fun way to drink a shot of espresso!  The food was all delicious! The service was wonderful and we had a very pleasant experience. It was a fantastic birthday celebration. My only complaint: Why is everything so petite??! You pay quite a premium on the dishes that I didn't expect from Giada. Also, beware that you are charged for \"still\" water! I thought they meant tap water when I was asked (they only offered still or sparkling), so I was surprised to see the charge on the bill. Oddly, they only served us the one bottle, then switched to tap water without asking us if we wanted another bottle of still water.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated along with the panorama views of LV Blvd. Now that's the good....the rest of the dining experience went downhill very quickly. The bartender was clearly overwhelmed and most likely needed some help.  Menu's were presented promptly and took our drink order (just ok ice tea).   We ordered the mulfetta and Giada hamburger which comes with thin zucchini fries.  The really bad - we waited and waited over 45 minutes for the order to arrive. The bartender told us several times it was coming soon and the kitchen was backed up because of a large group - I didn't see the group in the restaurant but perhaps it was an imaginary group?  Order finally arrived and the burger was dry along with cold zucchini fries. The mulfetta was nothing close to what you might get in New Orleans. The bread was not fresh, seasoning was lacking (come on - where's the olive spread and crushed garlic). Size was half a sandwich along with, you guessed it, cold zucchini fries.   The meal was mercifully coming to an end and finally paid for the bill. He did not charge us for the ice teas but if they had someone really managing the place, they would have not charged us at all. By the way, everyone at the bar (packed to capacity) had the same complaints.  The ultimate insult on the way out was seeing the piled high pre-made. mulfetta's stacked behind the counter!  Maybe Giada should spend some time in her 'named' restaurant or perhaps find some competent managers. Would expect much more in one of her establishments. I also see quite a few other reviews complaining on service and rather pedestrian food. Lots of fine dining establishments in LV - but not here.",

    "text": "I really liked this place. Our server was great (not constantly hovering but always there when you needed him) and the nearly floor to ceiling windows were perfect for someone like me who slept till lunch and needed all the natural light I could get. Before ordering, our server went over the menu and described our options as being \"designed\" for the time of day, which \"duh\" it's lunch, not dinner, different options, everyone does that right? Nope, after I finished eating, I got it. Like the natural light, everything I tasted helped me to come alive. The recipes were subtle, cool and refreshing, almost rejuvenating, and while I never felt any one thing was amazing, it just all worked.   For appetizers we tried the caponata $8, baby sweet peppers $12 and orzo meatballs $15. Interestingly enough, the cheaper the better here. The caponata was excellent and came with enough to cover about 10 crostini (it came with 6, we asked for the extra.) The baby sweet peppers stuffed with goat cheese and olive tapenade came with three and fit the theme of this review perfectly--not amazing but somehow still perfect. The orzo meatballs were probably my least favorite of everything I tried, as paying 3 to 4 dollars (per meatball) for a relatively small and un-compelling dish is not something I would advise and this is coming from a guy who falls for the aidells samples at Costco on the regular.   For lunch, I had the Waldorf Panzanella salad, which included a unique crouton-like raisin walnut bread I really enjoyed. I also split three other options: the Lobster Roll, Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese w/ prosciutto and Tuna sandwich. Getting back to the idea of refreshing, the lobster roll (served cold) included a lemon basil aioli, which along with the lemon pesto grilled cheese contributed to the overall feeling of zest I felt at the completion of our meal. Of the three, the grilled cheese was my favorite, followed by the lobster roll and then the tuna.   Try it or Diet Final Word  If soup taste 10x's better to you on a rainy day and/or there's nothing better to you than a ice cold beer after mowing your lawn, this is the place for you at lunch. It's good food served in the right atmosphere at the right time. Try it.",

    "text": "I just went back to Giada for the second time, and it was even better than I remember. I go to Vegas a few times a year, and this and Mizumi (in the Wynn) are the only restaurants I always *have* to go to.   We got the Giada's favorites sharing plate, which was delicious. The bruschetta has a thin slice of avocado on top, which really kicked it up. The bacon wrapped dates were divine. We shared the lemon spaghetti with prawns, it was so light and delicious, I'd highly recommend it. We also got the short rib with potatoes, which was incredibly tender, and some ravioli. Everything was delicious, but the lemon spaghetti was everyone's favorite. For dessert we had a lemon hazelnut tart that was just delicious. My drink was called The Destroyer, and it was delicious.  You have to be willing to drop about $150/person. It isn't a cheap place, and you won't enjoy it if you try to skimp out. If that's above your price range I'd go somewhere else instead of trying to eat here on a budget.   Overall, would recommend! Plan to go again and again!",

There were plenty of wait staff making sure you didn't need anything but they weren't intrusive where they interrupted your conversation and dinner ever 2 minutes.  The service was efficient.   They give you the option of eating the dishes family style which seems like a great idea and fits in line with giada's style and her philosophy.  However, I feel she would be better off having a separate menu for those interested in a family style serving of the food.  We thought it would be a great idea but some of the dishes are on the small end to be served family style with 4 people so I don't think you can get the full essence of the dish with just a couple of bites.    The food itself was clean and fresh but it didn't necessarily stand out for me.  I enjoyed it don't get me wrong.  The one dish I did think was cooked well was the charred octopus.",

    "text": "\"eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything\" - Giada De Laurentis  Giada did an excellent job; great location with stunning views of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip, swanky ambiance, stylish decor, an overall inviting and comfortable dining experience. The effort was extended to the tiniest details of her quotes written on every lampshade hanging from the ceiling - everything was seriously top-notch. The best part of dining at Giada was her complimentary photo-booth; What a beautiful touch: a perfect way to make lasting memories. I give her team 5 stars for making the restaurant shine like her gorgeous brand. Regretfully, I wish the same could have been said for the food.  The bread-service was decent; I enjoyed the parmesan crisps the most, the freshly baked rosemary bread was warm and fluffy - but extremely oily for my preference and the simple breadsticks weren't touched. The seasoning tray was a welcomed addition to our meal; we used all of the seasonings offered, since most of the dishes needed the extra kick. Yet, my favorite was the crispy fried capers - they were incredibly flavorful and texturally exciting.  My boyfriend and I kept it sweet and simple and ordered three dishes - crostini, pasta and seafood... Surprisingly; the crostini was the highlight of the entire evening. We were concerned three small dishes wouldn't be enough food for both of us, but we were wrong! We ended up uncomfortably stuffed, so keep that in mind as you order.  Unfortunately, these dishes weren't all memorable. There was only one dish that left us wanting more:  - Crostini: Pea pesto with prosciutto san Daniele $14 was mouthwateringly delicious, perfectly seasoned, with bright flavor and texture. The pea pesto had a similar flavor profile and texture as smashed avocado and the prosciutto was the freshest. Flavor rating: 5/5  The other two were only a notch above average. They were well executed, but lacked any real depth of flavor; I mildly tasted some sort of citrus ingredient and plain old salt in both dishes. However, the seasonings and flavor were mostly muted:  - Seafood: Lobster Arancini with Calabrian chili pomodoro & basil aioli $18 was actually a highly recommended dish from our waitress, so we thought we had a winner. The rice balls were fried very well, light and crispy, however the promise and essence of lobster was nonexistent. The filling was mushy and lacking complexity and the pomodoro sauce was leaning more towards the watery side, lacking bold flavor. The best part of the dish was the bright, inviting flavor of the basil aioli, but there was a minuscule amount offered on the plate. Flavor rating: 2/5 - Pasta: Risotto with lump crab meat and 2 scallops $30 were enjoyable, but we had some seasoning issues with the overall dish. We enjoyed the expertly cooked scallops and crab meat, both juicy and moist. Yet, while the risotto was under-seasoned, the scallops were aggressively seasoned. In retrospect, I understand now that I needed to eat a bite of risotto with a piece of scallop all together for \"the perfect bite\" however, I failed to do so; therefore the over/under seasoning caused a poor taste for the dish. Flavor rating: 3/5  Although I had some issues with two of the dishes, I'm confident that there are more delicious hidden gems offered in her large menu and I would definitely return to Giada to give something else a try.",

    "text": "Dined here 7/3  A longtime fan of Giada and lemon zest, I was excited to try her first ever restaurant in Vegas of all cities. I was curious to see how rustic family Italian recipes would transcend the lights of the Vegas strip.   The restaurant is a huge establishment situated at the top of a beautifully lit staircase in the boutique Cromwell hotel. The open kitchen with its abundant display of freshly made pastas, charcuterie and breads entice you as you walk to your table. Keeping up with the 21st century, you receive your menu both in a beautifully bound text as well as a detailed iPad.   I settled on the appetizer trio and enjoyed the chicken Marsala meatballs most. My significant other managed to elegantly divide and conquer his Tuscan ribeye so much so that he received accolades from our Joseph Gordon Levitt doppelganger waiter.   Dessert was rich and exactly as advertised. Rich chocolate ganache over rich chocolate cake. No more needs to be said. As we were celebrating an anniversary, they sent over a trio of gelato and some delicious cookies.   We left with our bellies full and our hearts happy.",

I shared the arugula pancetta salad and carbonera pizza with a friend and thought both were delicious. The arugula salad is fresh and light and balanced out the heavier carbonera pizza.  The chicken and waffles and salmon benny were both pretty good too. I would say that their portions are quite big and worth the price.  My friend and I initially ordered the chopped tricolore salad to share, but didn't realize it would be served with a heavy blue cheese dressing. If you're a big blue cheese fan, this is the perfect salad for you. Our server offered to switch out our salad for another one, so we ordered the arugula salad. I really appreciated our server for doing that for us.  I would come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

For dinner we split the tortellini which was pretty good, but again, pricey for not being awesome. I'd like to offer 3 1/2 stars because the service was good but maybe a little too attentive?

All tables have 4 sides so the fact that they did not accommodate with 2 weeks notice is unacceptable.   I've known many people that went here successfully too and they all said it was good but not for the price.  Good but over priced from what I hear.   Go to Golden Steer or Gallagher's!!!",

And food of a quality to satisfy any pallet.  This place is almost inherently a tapas restaurant. It begs you try several smallish items rather going for one of their few larger mains. We had 6 different items and the weakest of which was above average. I'm a bit prejudiced to anything wrapped in bacon since bacon is so damn goon it can make anything palletable and thus I tend to think of it as a wrapping for something g weak. Not the case here. The bacon wrapped dates were great. I'll probably never say that again.  Pasta dishes were flavorful but light. Southern style. Portions were just right considering we had three dishes each. I've seen reviewers complain about portion size but I think might not understand this cuisine. And the pricing is appropriate.   Great location. Excellent service. Creatively traditional menu, if that makes sense. All around great experience. I will certainly be returning.",

The evening started off with drinks at the bar before being led to our private room with balcony! I know 7 people is a lot, but I never expected to get a private room. Truly appreciative! My friends and I were able to actually hear each other and spend the evening relaxing.  Our waiter was amazing.  We tried just about every appetizer on the menu. Make sure to get the bacon wrapped dates and the ricotta shortbreads. I had the lobster ravioli for my main course and saved room for all of the desserts. My favorite cookie is the peanut butter and jelly one. I took some home for breakfast the next day.  The evening ended with people watching and photos on the balcony. I would highly recommend booking your birthday at Giada's.  This restaurant has become one of my favorite in Vegas. Headed back for breakfast this weekend!",

He did not let us know,  therefore, we got way too much food which wasn't cheap.  I have dined at a lot of nice restaurants and the food was just okay.  Not bad but not very special either.  I had the octopus salad, the veal Milanese and the lobster ravioli.  I have been at several of the celebrity chefs restaurants, such as Bobby Flay's in NY.   The food always seems just okay at these restaurants.  Perhaps the celebrity chefs are spending more time on the TV shows and less on the quality of their restaurants.",

Her days are not filled as much as her nights so she joined me at Bally's for the auction and we decided to go off and get some lunch.   It had to be close (didn't want to miss too much of the auction action) and it had to be fun.  Giada's fit the bill perfectly.  We were both very impressed as we walked into the place, it was absolutely beautiful.  The hostess seated us at their best window table overlooking the strip and Caesar's Palace.   As I was treating I was thrilled to see that the prices were more than reasonable for lunch.   You can actually have lunch in this amazing place for under $20 per person.  Of course we didn't but still it was much less than I would have expected.     I had a Bloody Mary and my friend had a Prosecco to start us off and for our lunches she had the Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro ($16) which the waiter explained to us is not your traditional Gnocchi but one that is more of a pasta than a potato flavor...he was right and it was still delicious.   I decided to enjoy a pizza, the Salumi Piccante spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, oregano (also $16).  Delicious and generous... a table of four could share one as a hearty appetizer.   Our server was exceptional, nice and very helpful in steering us to other places that we should try during our respective Las Vegas vacations!   My friend thought the hostesses' dresses were adorable.",

We came for brunch which served a sampler meal for $45. BEST. $45. SPENT.  It came with a three taster appetizer - benedict deviled eggs, quiche, and like a brioche. Anyways... it was good.   Then we got to get a meal - which I got the Salmon Benedict because... I eat everything Benedict... (Hello, Cumberbatch). The benedict was really good. The eggs were perfectly runny and you mush it and put it on the piece of bread provided. So good.  My husband got the chicken and waffles and it was SO seasoned. So well. I don't usually like chicken, but damn. This was good. That butter you put on the waffles was amazing too.   The dessert provided was the chocolate espresso cake (which was ICE CREAM) and the \"limon\" souffle. They were both delicious and I am usually not a fan of lemon.   They also gave us a basket of pastries that were so good.   SERVICE: Very attentive and fast.  AMBIANCE: Very pretty and the view is amazing.  OVERALL: I loved this place. I",

I've been here for breakfast, lunch (twice), dinner, and a wedding reception brunch.  Each visit has always featured excellent customer service and tasty food.  Of the meals that I've enjoyed the most, dinner is my favorite because I love the Lemon Spaghetti with the huge shrimp.  Yes, the restaurant is everything Giada, from the plates to the paper towels in the restroom, but it IS her place.  I love the decor, wide open spaces, and views of the Strip.  I also very much enjoy the free photo booth in the lobby.   If you go, ask for seats next to the window so you can see all the hustle and bustle on Las Vegas Blvd. This is one place in town that's always been consistently satisfying for us and I look forward to having dinner here again soon.

Pros: *The view is wonderful of the fountain show across the strip *The food is very good to say the least. *The decor and style is AWESOME *The Lemon Cream Spaghetti is to die for But why so friggin small-2 Tablespoons of Pasta  on my plate with a beautiful Shrimp. I want more dammit. *Lamb Chops and Salmon-Superb!! but... (see below) *The Dessert tray and Gelato is A+  Cons:  *Service: Nice people but inattentive occasionally. Should have brought road flares to get some service. Note: One waiter tried to take my dish while I was obviously still eating. Maybe he has a date waiting outside. On Occassion we waited a long time for attention or for the food to arrive. *Noise Level: Sucks. Why do restaurants need to blast loud music? I hate yelling at the table during normal conversation. Geez, Why not add a Costco Hearing to the menu selection. *Portions: are fu fu small so make sure you bring your high school microscope; sorry I am a hungry American who works hard and likes reasonable portions.  If I order lamb chops give me more than 3 oz. total meat in 4 minuscule chop slivers.  Honest Conclusion: It's probably me. Even though I was a guest I can't understand leaving a restaurant still hungry and having my host pay more for the meal than my first 2 cars  (A Chevy Corvair and a explode on rear impact Ford Pinto) No comments Please:-)   Great location and obvious excellent food but this is not a great value for a Hoi Poi guys like me. I just don't get fancy restaurants with low value and high prices.  Like I said it's just me.........",

Head thru the casino and up the escalator were  breakfast is served at the bar from starting at 8:00 am to 9:00  and then the dining room opens up at 9:00 am.  I had a conference call so it was kind of awkward setting up and ordered breakfast at the bar. But my  friendly waitress was very accommodating and helpful. On the way  I  met the head chef and I got to speak with him briefly about the prior Yelp event put on here which looked fabulous. The staff was very accommodating and enabled me to take pics prior before they were open at 8 a.m.  Heart the attention to details here - from the napkins,  plates, condiments to the presentation of entrees.  The decor of the  restaurant is stunningly beautiful.   I ordered the Contadina breakfast which included spinach, tomatoes, two eggs over medium, polenta cakes and toast. In addition, much to my surprise - chef of cuisne Bruce M.  brought me over another entree -  eggs & waffles. Everything here tasted so fresh and delicious.  I would  highly suggest making a stop here at Giada's signature debut restaurant, I'll certainly  be returning for lunch or dinner in the future.",

    "text": "We've been here twice and each time it was a disappointment. I really wanted to love Giada's but the food is sub-par. It's not the best nor is it the worst. It's just okay. For the amount of money you're spending, it's NOT worth it.   The first time we came here was during the grand opening week a few years ago. Then we went again Nov 8 for my mother-in-laws birthday because she is wanted to go there. We warned her it wasn't going to be worth it, but we had to go w/ what the birthday lady wanted!   FOOD   Margherita pizza: herb roasted Campari tomatoes mozzarella and basil. This was ok. Portion is small. The dough is good, but I wanted more tomatoes.   Spaghetti made w/ shrimp, lemon and basil. if you enjoy lemon, then you'll enjoy this dish. But that's all you really taste. Pasta was cooked well. Eat it fast or it'll begin to get clumpy since it's a creamy sauce.   Salmon: this was the worst dish we had. The salmon was over cooked even though we asked for medium. The salmon tasted fishy so it was low-quality. Don't get it!!!  SERVICE   The service was great during the grand open. But when we came back earlier this month you could tell all the employees were not getting along and they were understaffed.   The hostess was friendly. But we were not seated right away even though we've made a reservation. We had to wait at the bar for at least 10 minutes past our reservation time.  Once we're seated,our server did not realize we were there in till 15 minutes after. It was as if they had forgotten about us because they were so overwhelmed and busy. When the server took our order you could tell he was agitated.   The table next to us received their food late. We also witnessed the food runner and a server get into an argument in front of us too when they served the food to the table next to us. It was hella awkward and unprofessional to see.   PRICE   For the portions that we received I really feel like we overpaid. Everything was very small and I don't believe the quality or the taste warrants a $40 dish. I would've been OK with the price had we experienced excellent service. Sadly, that wasn't the case. So my opinion on the value and price is this place is way overpriced!   Overall, I wouldn't come back here again. I rated them 2 stars. The food I would rate three stars because it was OK and edible. But because of the price and service that's why I give them an overall rating of two stars.  Happy Dining,   JT",

    "text": "Well, when you're in Vegas and want fine dining you know what to expect: high prices, small portions, and a whole lot of chic.  And Giada gives you exactly that.  The main reason I don't rank it higher is the service is fairly lacking and the food, while good, not particularly memorable.  We were a larger group of 6 but thanks to a reservation we got seated pretty quickly.  But after being seated it was a solid 15-20 minutes before anyone came back to take our drink order.  After our drink order was taken, service was a little more on point although it still took quite a while for our drinks to be delivered.  The food was good if not mind blowing. I ordered the pasta flight which is a pretty safe option.  I liked the different pastas (spaghetii is probably the highlight) but the portions were small.  Plan on eating something later cause you will not be full.  There was complimentary bread (unless one of my group pulled a fast one and got it) which was tasty.  They had the thin cracker style as well as a nice fresh herb loaf.  The garlic butter was tasty as well.  I did like my dirty gin martini so the bartender did a good job with it.  My gf ordered the buccatini pasta which she enjoyed. As an app we ordered the sausage pizza.   A solid option but again, nothing particular memorable and literally handsize.  Bottom line, Giada is a beautiful venue with solid food at top prices.  Typical Vegas.  I was a little disappointed overall with the service and lack of anything special or memorable.  But there are worse options for dining out in Vegas.",

They even charged us for the wrong dish that we sent back and was corrected later when we pointed out.

    "text": "I feel guilty for not loving Giada's restaurant! I've been a big fan of hers for a very long time (I've even attended a wedding with her!) Giada was the first person that inspired my passion for cooking and love for food!   My husband and I have dined here twice for dinner, both on weeknights. I love the location, and I agree with others that the design and feel of the place is beautiful and represents Giada perfectly. The restaurant seemed less than half full, and their primo view seating area half empty as well. Leading us to our table, the hostess walked us past beautiful art, beautiful lighting, beautiful tables with people enjoying beautiful food- only to veer us to this dim, obscure, weird corridor that leads to the private dining room at the right of the restaurant. This was probably my biggest qualm of the evening. They have about 4 or 5 two-person tables here. I unfortunately sat with my back to the whole restaurant. And we were the only party back there! (Another couple was sat at the table across from us and moved after 2 minutes) The area felt too isolated and segregated from the main restaurant. Might I add that the second time we came here (several months later) we were sat at the same table! (With the same total number of guests) I know that it's on me to request a different table but we had a show to see that evening and didn't want jeopardize the timing. It's just a crappy thing spending all that money walking out feeling like you haven't even dined at the actual restaurant. I found myself taking my time exiting only so I could take in all that I missed out on.   The table settings we unique and pretty. I loved the little \"g\"s everywhere. I did feel however that the utensils were dull, used up and needed to be replaced, and my place mat and menu could've been a little more clean. Both times we had a male server who was pleasant but very unenthusiastic and dull. Personally, I feel that a good portion of the people choosing to dine at Giada's restaurant go for fanatical reasons, perhaps like a type of pilgrimage! And dropping some major bucks to do so. If the staff doesn't match that demeanor it can cast a completely different light on the the whole experience.   Their cocktails were delicious! I agree about the service overall- very slow. As for the food itself, as much as I love Giada and Italian food, I felt it was completely overpriced for what you get. The flavors were great, pasta fresh, but really nothing spectacular to write home about. I literally have made half of the items on her menu, which is why I was so surprised that as I was actually eating her food, it didn't really stand out any better than my renditions. The ambiance and cocktails might be enough for me to stop by for a quick drink and appetizer at the bar (somewhere where I can feel included and actually see the restaurant!), but I don't see myself dining here again. Grazie, but no grazie.",

I only go to  Vegas 2-3 times a year, but I know where I will be going.  - As we came up the escalator, my party of 10 was greeted by two friendly young ladies at the top. We only had to wait about 5 minutes prior to being seated. They have a cool photobooth setup which was great for bringing some fun to our short wait. Business side, I love that they had that booth there and a great way to capture emails for future marketing.  - Inside, as we all sat down I took notice of all the artwork around us. Beautiful and unique artwork all around. As for the rest of the restaurant, very great ambiance and very tidy and clean. Of course it is though, right?  - Staff was very friendly and completely sharp and on point with making our experience there the best through and through.   - Food, OMG! Don't even let me get started on the food. Superb dishes. My party mainly did big family style dishes so we had an opportunity to try most of their top picks. We didn't know too much of what to pick, so we put our trust into the staff and it was phenomenal.",

    "text": "I can imagine the pitch meeting for this restaurant...  \"Listen Giada --  We're gonna do a place in Vegas with your face and name absolutely EVERYWHERE...\"  So yeah, that's what it's like.  Still, we got a Groupon for $40 for breakfast or lunch plus champagne and it was a heck of deal.  I highly recommend you use the Groupon for breakfast for the biggest bang for the buck - which is what we did.  Website says they open at 8 AM but they don't.  They open at 9.  So know that.  We had built our schedule around an early breakfast and we were stuck waiting for them to open.    EVERYTHING here has Giada on it.  From the napkins to the pictures to the TV playing her shows to the bathroom towels.  It's a little weird and comes across as so heavy-handed.  I think Anne Burrell is way hotter but I like women chefs that like women, so that's just me.    Once you get past the ego trip, the place is pretty.  It's actually lovely.  And if you show up early (at the time they actually open, not the time they claim to open) you should be lucky enough to get a table by the window with a nice view.  But don't believe that you'll have a \"perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains\".  You can maybe see them if you stretch.  It's obstructed.  More PR.  Giada must have an awesome PR team.  I'm not someone that likes a big breakfast.  I'm good with coffee and a muffin so I did the Giada's Fresh Pastry Assortment ($5 for one pastry).  I got what they call Monkey Bread but which is essentially a chocolate croissant.  It was good and just the right size for my breakfast needs.  The coffee BTW was excellent.  As was the champagne included in our deal.  I was very happy.  My vegetarian SO got the Breakfast Contadina - two eggs served any style, crispy polenta cakes,wilted spinach, oven roasted tomatoes & toast ($17).  It was very good and satisfied her - she likes a hearty breakfast and this was perfect.  Service was just spot on.  We really enjoyed our breakfast here.  I can't imagine they offer Groupon deals that often but if you see one, GRAB IT and absolutely plan a breakfast here.  It's a steal of a deal and quite the scene.  Worth it.",

    "text": "Mediocre.  I know there are better Italian joints in Vegas and beyond, but a good friend of mine really wanted to go and since it was his birthday wish, so be it.  First, this woman is a brand.  I'm not a big fan of her cooking show (mostly about the boob) and I'm not a big fan of the cooking show either.  That being said, her establishment has a fantastic location that makes use of the glitter and neon lights of Vegas and I must admit, I had my share of fun that included the photo booth in the reception area.    The lunch menu here is limited and uninventive.  Since I was not in the mood for pizza, I opted for the Muffuletta sandwich, which was not even a full sandwich.  It was half a sandwich and served with deep fried zucchini strings.  While the sandwich was good, the bread was dense and overly hard, which made me question the freshness of it.  Second, while the zucchini shoestrings were good, the chef may want to rethink the concept since every time I went to pinch a few, it snapped a lot of the strings.  By the time I was finished, most of the zucchini shoestrings had been reduced to a series of broken matchsticks.  Pretty on the plate, not practical to consume.  Perhaps larger shavings?  My other friend ordered a pizza and she did say that the dough was very good, but the price did not reflect the single layer of prosciutto on top.   While the experience was a pleasant one due to the simple and pretty interiors as well as the waitstaff (trained, no doubt, to tell us that Giada's family prefers to eat the pizza in one manner or Giada prefers you to take a bite of this etc etc), I will not return for a second visit.  Thank you, however, for making my friend's birthday a good one.  The two cookie presentation was nice too and the Lemon Ricotta cookie was very good.",

    "text": "So... You know when books have these very intriguing visually pleasing covers with eye-catching graphic design, well placed lettering, and a fascinating synopsis on the back? But then you actually read the contents of the book and find yourself bored? Almost feeling tricked? Yeah. Maybe a little harsh, but that's how I feel about my recent dining experience at Giada's inside the Cromwell.  I have to say I absolutely loved the ambiance. Such a beautifully decorated restaurant with warm coloring, soft lighting, and gigantic windows with a breathtaking view of the bellagio fountains & Caesar's palace -- the venue is a perfect scenario for a girls night out or a fancy date night. Our server was also very charming & friendly, not a single negative thing I can say about the restaurant itself or about the service... and that's where my 3 stars come from entirely. Like I said, the cover of the book was very intriguing.   The food? Same thing... absolutely beautiful presentation. But portions are very small, and I was disappointed by the taste of almost everything. Giada's Italian cuisine definitely has its own twist with Californian influences -- so it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But for small portions I expect big flavor. Again, beautiful cover with a boring read. Nothing was noteworthy about this place to be honest... other than the strip view, enjoyable music playlist & chic ambiance. You're really paying for the experience, not the menu.  Ordered: - ORZO MEATBALLS: $15. Four small meatballs in marinara sauce & parmesan pomodoro. (Very bland & unremarkable) - BACON WRAPPED DATES: $15. Five gorgonzola creme filled spicy sausages. (Only thing I semi-enjoyed out of our whole meal) - SPAGHETTI: $34. Two shrimp with a lemon & basil white sauce. (Decent dish, very citrus based) - RISOTTO: $35. Two large scallops with red king crab merus & peas/asparagus. (Scallops extremely salty, risotto extremely bland) - RAVIOLI: $36. Six small lobster filled ravioli with asparagus tips & tarragon. (This resembled a microwaveable dinner, so disappointing) - WHITE LASAGNA: $35. Two jumbo prawns on top of lemon ricotta & spiced tomato broth lasagna. (Very small portion, square slice)  *We also tried to order the OYSTER CRUDO appetizer, but they were out of it... as well as the SALMON main entree. Womp womp.",

    "text": "You don't hear as much about Giada being a restaurant chef so I was definitely interested to try her food. Happily, I can say I was very impressed with the brunch we had this morning. Before I get into food though, I will say there was a bit too much branding. There were \"Giada\"s and \"G\"s everywhere. Like don't get me wrong a little advertisement is good, but we knew we were eating at her restaurant without having a huge \"G\" on our plate.   With that said, I ordered the sunrise polenta waffle. Now I don't normally order waffles when I brunch because I'm not really into the super sweet breakfast foods. This however, was sweet and savory to the max! The base of this dish was the delicious polenta waffle studded with crispy, salty pancetta and laced with chives. It was topped with MORE crispy pancetta nuggets, 2 sunny up eggs-perfectly cooked and runny. Team Runny Yolk for life, ya know what I mean? On the side for your pouring pleasure were two sauces: maple syrup and a bechamel. Again nailing the savory and sweet.   For dessert we ordered the pastry basket (technically not a dessert but sweet enough to work). You can order one or five, I don't think it's any surprise we went with 5. In reverse order of delicious here were our choices:  5. Gluten free brownie bites- Betty Crocker proved to me you can make a bomb gluten free brownie so I know it can be done. These were not it though. They were hard, dry, not very chocolatey, all together a fail.   4. Banana muffin- This was ok, nothing memorable but I liked the mascarpone butter and caramel topping.   3. Rosemary Scone- nice play on savory and sweet. The scone was crumbly with a liberal amount of crunchy sugar on top adding a lovely texture. The rosemary added a pleasant woodsy note that I really enjoyed.   2. Chocolate Croissant Monkey Bread- I think the reason this didn't clinch the top spot was because of the name of it that I found misleading. When I think monkey bread, I think cinnamon and butter. What we got was pull-apart chocolate croissants, like 3 croissants baked next to each other so they were touching. There was nothing reminiscent of monkey bread other then the pull apart action. Naming aside these were delicious chocolate croissants. The chocolate was still melty when you bit into it, exactly as it should be.  1. Cheese Danish- this was one of the best versions of a cheese Danish I've ever had. The pastry part had layers on layers of flakiness that crackled as you bit down but melted in your mouth. The cheese center was thick and sweet-but perfectly balanced with the sharp tang from cream cheese. Home room pastry for sure!",

My companion had artichoke starter, scallops on mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. We had a Stag's Leap Chardonnay. Too full for desert but we did have coffee.  This is my second visit. Food was very good. Again.  The bill came and I supplied my CC. By the time Joseph came back I had an phone bank alert for the charge. I completed the check and we left. I have not had an alert for the tip amount. I owe Joseph his tip.  And now my gripe. I cannot find a business office number so I can call and correct the situation. I called the reservation number but they did not know what to do. A supervisor was supposed to call me. I have heard nothing yet.  Please let me tip Joseph.",

We have been to many upscale restaurants in LV and I must say I don't understand the negative comments. The food was amazing, we had the antipasti platter for the table and everything was very very good the bacon wrapped dates were awesome. My wife and and shared the vegetable Bolognese rigatoni and the eggplant parmigiana with avocado, and broccolini as a side. Everything was great we cleaned our plates. The desserts were life changing and an after dinner espresso just topped the meal off. Our server Fred was extremely attentive and had very good suggestions. We will definitely be coming back! Great job giada!!",

Grilled cheese with prosciutto and lemon is truly a dish that sets the innovation here to new levels.  The pizza, and olives were a great combo.  The orange cappucino, and zeppole's are something you will not find at the feast of San Gennaro.  The food at Giada's are very flavorful.  The lemon grilled cheese allowed you to distinctively taste the lemon along with the sandwich.  Italian, Innovative, Iconic, Las Vegas--A True Culinary Capital!

I may be slightly biased simply because Giada is my favorite cook on the food network but the food and atmosphere really did impress me. For starters, I probably had the best arancini in my life from here. I also really loved the bread that they brought out too especially the foccacia bread. Of course we had to go with her signature lemon spaghetti shrimp and it was so incredible yet so simple. I honestly don't know how they make it taste so good. Overall, I was super pleased with just about everything and I really want to make another visit.",

The restaurant itself is very intimate and if you have the right table it overlooks the Bellagio fountains. They have both formal dining and a lounge area although I haven't tried out the lounge area yet. I suggest making a reservation as they always seem to have a full house whenever I do go !",

After waiting over two hours to get in to the Bacchanal (1 in the virtual line, over 1 in an actual line) and no real end (re:food) in sight, we dipped out of the line and out of Caesar's entirely.   There, on the street, was a gleaming beacon of hope - Giada. Certainly there was food there!  We were more than happy to get immediate seating and full service at the bar. Our main bartender (Katie. My new BFF) was kind, compassionate, and more than obliging to my requests for flowing cups of booze.   I won't tease you with the INCREDIBLE flavors of the feast we dug into, but I WILL say that the pictures won't do the menu justice ...

I wasn't happy about that and the fact that the gals in the hostess counter weren't very friendly. On a positive note, the restaurant is beautiful. The ambiance is inviting and romantic. With huge glass windows looking out into the strip and bellagio fountains, it's truly an ideal date night place :) We had the grilled octopus and butternut squash soup for starters. Loved both. For entrees, I highly recommend the spaghetti. As simple as it sounds, it's a nice twist to the traditional dish. Giada makes it with a lemon basil buttery sauce, topped with capers. It's served with 2 large prawns. It was definitely filling. Papaya dells was also delicious. I wish their service was better. Our sever was slow to bring out menus and it took him a while to take our order. Giada's is worth a visit. The menu has a lot to offer and the food is good and priced right.",

The Orzo Meatballs and the Pea Crostini were on point. I am not a fan of peas, but I wanted to try something new. The Orzo meatballs are tender and flavorful.  So excited to see Burrata on the menu. It was a perfect accompaniment to the warm bread and crisp breadsticks served with your meal. The lemon mascarpone, pesto, pepperoncino, and sea salt made the warm bread even more inviting.   Knowing Giada from the Food Network, since she first was on, I knew to expect lemon zest in a lot of the dishes. I love her for that addition of freshness.  We took our time and ordered the main dishes. I had the Seared Scallop Risotto with crab and asparagus spears. Tender rice, great seasoning, and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Papparedelle Pork Ragout was also very tasty. The pasta was delicate and the flavor of the ragout was so good, I finished his dish too.  I will visit her restaurant every time we return. Our bartenders were attentive and made it a beautiful experience.",

The view is impeccable. There is a panoramic view of Bellagio so every 15minutes you are able to look out and see the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show! One of the very few restaurants in Vegas with an amazing view! Luckily it's not buried in a casino :)   The food that I recommend is the lobster risotto appetizer, lemon spaghetti (tapa) ,and the chicken cacciatore (entree).  Cocktails? Order the destroyer! Spiked with tequila and it will definitely have you feeling a nice buzz!   The service was amazing. Even including the hostess and kitchen manager!   The hostess gave us a tour of the restaurant before taking us to our seat and we were also greeted by the kitchen manager during our meal!",

    "text": "So I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little biased, I love her. She is my favorite chef on Food Network. I was excited to try this place, at first I planned to wait a few months and let all the hype die down, but when my friend scored us a 7p reservation, I changed my mind pretty quickly.   When we arrived, we waited way passed our reservation time, only to find out Giada was in the house, so people were staying longer at their tables. As soon as we walked in, she was there taking pics with people on their way out.   We were started with a tour of the restaurant and the prep area, which was fun to see. Our table could not have been in a better spot. Perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Greeted immediately by our waiter who gave us a quick rundown of the iPad cocktail menu, we all started out with a signature cocktail.  Something different for everyone, and every single person enjoyed their drinks. I tried the Destroyer, Clase Azul Tequila Reposado, tangerine, orange and basil, basil ice sphere, as well as the La Strada, Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, Proseco, and (don't judge) Barbarella, Tanqueray #10, orange spice ginger beer, fresh lemon, basil foam (this was my favorite).    I was excited to see they offered a tasting menu but to my disappointment, we were informed the way they have their tasting menu set up is a family style, so everyone at the table is required to order the tasting menu. So we went with the original plan of ordering something different for everyone to try. We started our with their amazing bread basket, I was more obsessed with the condiments that it came with, the lemon butter and the dried capers with my favorite. Onto the apps, we couldn't decide so we ordered multiple. The large appetizer platter was big enough for 5 people and it had a little but of everything. I had picked the Oysters Crudo, which were fantastic, the Burrata, amazing, Lobster Arancini, best Arancini I have had. I could have stopped at the apps and been happy.   I originally had planned to get the Lemon Spaghetti, but then I wanted the Branzino, so our waiter told me to order the Branzino and I could have the Spaghetti as a side. Perfect! This dish was executed to perfection. I love Seabass, this had a perfect char on the skin, and the Lemon Spaghetti is as good as everyone says. The shrimp was as big as my palm.  My friends Rack of Lamb was my favorite. I would order this next time. The Ribeye was cooked perfectly too. TONS of sides! Ravioli, Crispy Polenta, Asparagus, and Lemon Potatoes.   Next up, the dessert tray. I was so full by the time this came around, but we still indulged. She has some really unique desserts.  Service was excellent, our server was very attentive, as well as everyone else that helped him out.  Highlight of my night, she came around to the table and spoke with us about our meal. She was so personable and nice, upon leaving, I was able to take a picture with her. Totally made my night.",

    "text": "Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.    This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.  The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.  For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.    Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).    Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.  The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in \"Tuscan\" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.  Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.  Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.  Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.",

There is a gerat view of the bellagio fountains, so try to request a table by the windows. The prices were a little high, but to be expected in Las Vegas. Everyone was raving about the lemon butter that comes with the bread - it was amazing. I had the spaghetti with shrimp but I had food envy over my coworkers who had the ravioli! For dessert they gave us a selection of cookies - the lemon ricotta cookie was delicious!",

Now that we have that out of the way, if you're still reading (and hopefully eating soon), you are in for an amazing experience.  We had a few drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated for our 10 p.m. reservation.  That's right. 10 p.m. and we booked that a month and a half out.  This place is popular.  Service was flawless, both at the bar and at our table.  Our dinner was overseen by Joseph Gordon Levitt, aka Gregory. A+!  He knows the menu and flavors like it's his job.  Oh, wait.  Any way, he did a fantastic job of making recommendations and even suggested the order of how our choices should be served.  Truly outstanding server.    We started with oysters crudo, oysters rockefeller, Vitello Tonnato crostini, bacon-wrapped dates.  I've been around the block when it comes to bacon-wrapped dates and these were amazing.  I also really loved the oysters crudo.  Probably the only dish I would not reorder was the crostini.  Next we had our pasta course and shared the lemon spaghetti and buscatini.  Both were phenomenal, the sweet and tart of the lemon spaghetti contrasted nicely with the spiciness of the buscatini.  Both were incredible, but I think if I had either as my entire meal, I would not have been satisfied.  Just not a big pasta eater.  Gregory's recommendation to do a pasta course and then a main course was a great one.  For our main course, we shared the 28 oz ribeye and chicken cacciatore.  The presentation of the chicken was mind-blowing.  The staff presents the whole chicken with its \"fixings\" and then it's returned to the chef to be carved and brought back to your table in all of its glory.  The steak was very well-prepared, well-seasoned and the argula and fried egg were the perfect touches.  I can't even talk about our dessert course.  I was in a coma by that point.  The dining room is still working out a few kinks.  I am one of those people who believe that if you have a reservation, your ass better be in a chair no later than 5 minutes past and we waited over a half hour past our reservation.  Everything was so wonderful, I can forgive a little tardiness.  This place is a foodie's wet dream.  Love, love, love.  Giada had the night off, so I am cashing in my retirement to return and meet the dynamo behind this mecca.",

The only thing is, this place is overpriced for the food you get. The lobster hash is $34, and the lobster should be cooked perfectly. It was good but not perfect especially for the price.   This place seems great for women who like to be in beautiful places with beautiful looking food. My wife ordered the salmon benedict and she liked it very much. A little pricey for brunch, but we are glad we checked this place out. Thank you Giada!",

We did get to sit right by the windows though which was very nice.  The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived and we had to wait over 20 minutes even though we had a reservation but the woman at the entrance told us that they were running late. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located in the middle of the Strip, which makes it easy to reach on your way to pretty much any casino. As always on the strip, you can park at any casino nearby.  We took a pizza and their muffaletta. Both were decently good, but very small for the price you pay, particularly the pizza. The muffaletta did come with zucchini fries though which made it much better.  Overall, my experience with Giada was positive and I would recommend it. This is a decently good restaurant with a great view of the strip. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

The food was fine, but holy crap, the service and quality of our meal was quite sub par for the prices we were expected to pay. The main course we had expected came out after 40 min after the charcuterie appetizer which was fine, and had a great selection of meats. Given the location, it was fine, however I have had much better charcuterie plates. We had both ordered the lobster ravioli, and what we had been given was a well constructed ravioli with a hollandaise type sauce (done well) with pasta that I feel was fresh if it was made at the beginning of the day. It was underdone, quite under al dente. Chewy. We were surrounded by pretentious groups of people and awkward couples. Which made my girlfriend and I feel fantastic, we had a great time people watching. Overall the experience was less than exciting. I really don't know what I expected from a celebrity chef's restaurant, but it was at least an adventure.",

    "text": "I don't cook, but I do enjoy watching cooking shows, and that includes all 126 of them in which Giada either works her magic in a kitchen, hosts, or acts as a judge. So it goes without saying that I could not wait to have a meal at her very first restaurant, which just happens to be in one of my favorite cities. Giada opened last spring, and when my husband and I visited Vegas a few months later last June, it was booked solid. So we tried again on our recent trip to Vegas in December. Our first attempt was for dinner and there were no openings the entire night. We then decided to give it another shot for lunch and only had a ten minute wait... score! Lunch seems to be the way to go.   The restaurant itself is very \"Giada\" in every way. It has that California cool vibe, but in a classy way. When you first walk in, you see a display case of all the fresh foods and ingredients before walking past the open kitchen. The large panoramic windows offer a stunning view of the strip in every direction.  The lunch menu seems a bit limited... several cheese, meat, or veggie antipasto plates, a handful of pastas, flatbread pizzas, and sandwiches. I was hoping to try the lemon spaghetti, but it's unfortunately served at dinner only. Our sever informed us that bread was only brought to the table if antipasto is ordered. So we started with the parmigiano reggiano served with a bit of honey that was actually still on a piece of honeycomb. It was good, but a mess to eat since you had to crumble the hard cheese yourself using a fork. My husband was covered in cheese by the time we were finished preparing it... it's a good thing parmigiano is his color. The bread is four very small pieces of flatbread that come with a pesto dipping sauce. I actually preferred the pesto to the cheese and honey. I found it ridiculous that they force customers to buy an overpriced antipasto plate just to receive the few bites of bread.  For our entrees, I ordered the lemon pesto grilled cheese and my husband had the lasagna upon recommendation of our server who described it as a \"traditional meat and cheese\" lasagna. My sandwich was very tasty... like a grown up version of grilled cheese. My husband's lasagna was not the traditional version he was expecting being that it had more diced eggplant mixed in rather than meat, but he enjoyed it nonetheless. Both entrees came with a choice of arugula salad with a light olive oil dressing or crispy zucchini strings. The zucchini strings were very light and flavorful.  Service was slow, but we were told their system was down and that was causing the backup. Our server was friendly though and our glasses of iced tea stayed full. We were in no rush and simply enjoyed the down time.  Now that I have finally tried Giada's restaurant, I feel like it has been a check off my bucket list, but I wouldn't be in a huge hurry to return. Was it good? Absolutely. However, it was overpriced for the smaller portions served and I can think of a few other True traditional Italian restaurants that I'd rather visit when in town instead of this version described as Italian with a California twist.",

The spinach and polenta cakes both are somewhat bland with the exception of the tomato in the spinach. They were both in need of a little salt. The meatballs were dense and lightly seasoned in a very nice light tomato sauce. Now these mushrooms just had so much incredible flavor with the nuts and cheese on top. I would go back for lunch and just order the mushrooms again and again and again. The front case with the dried meats and cheeses, olives and other assorted goodies has the best aroma coming out of it. I would have listed 5 stars if the spinach and the polenta cakes have been better.",

Once your seated the seating and your view of the strip are fantastic. Our waitor Fred was the perfect addition  we were two couples and we dud the tasting menu. It was the perfect way to get a taste of the best things on the menu.  The choices tonight we're perfect. And the dessert is amazing.  The roll the tray over for you to take three choices each.  One better than the other.  This is not an inexpensive restaurant so be ready but it is worth every penny!",

We had a party of 15 and we were seated in a private room which was nice and there's also a photobooth in the waiting area BUT the food was overall too salty. I got the surf and turf and the meat was dry and salty and its topped with 1 ravioli which was hard and burned on one edge and that was $56 I was truly expecting better. The service was below avg and the waiter was sorta rude. And for the bday girl they gave her 2 cookies and no candle. And we brought a cake which we weren't allowed to eat at the restaurant unless we pay $10 per person so we had to take the cake home and have yet to eat it.",

Except for the Caprese salad, which is nearly impossible to mess up, everything we ordered was inedible for one reason or another. One of the dishes was bland, another too spicy, and the third was bland and had a texture that was inconsistent. It was definitely the most money I've ever spent on food that was that bad and a contender for the worst meal in a restaurant.

The pizzas are fairly small and average at best.  The orechiette pasta with tomato sauce was overcooked and the tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a tin can.  Small sized lunch apps (4 small meatballs) were $14.  Restaurant was less than half filled and they told us it would take 15 minutes to seat a party of two.  We ate at the bar where a bartender with no personality took our order, and spent most of his time trying to ignore the dozen or so customers eating at the bar.  Must say that the prosciutto appetizer was excellent.  The wood fired ovens make the place smell like someone is cooking barbecue at a bonfire.  The smell is abrasive and definitely sticks to your shirt.",

    "text": "Oh, Giada. I'm probably one of her #1 fans. I've watched every show, own several of her cookbooks and cook her recipes weekly. I had my birthday in Vegas (all 8 of us traveled from out of state) just so we could have my 30th birthday dinner at her restaurant- I know, I said I was probably her #1 fan.  My husband made reservations 3 months in advance for my birthday for a table of 8 on New Years Day. We all arrived right on time for our reservation, hostesses were on the dry side- no smiles or warm welcome.   Service started off fine 1 star to the server.   We all ordered cocktails and 3 bottles of wine, a couple appetizers and everyone ordered an entree. 2 Spaghetti's (Spah-geh-tee's) that had shrimp, lemon, basil this dish was fresh tasting with the lemon and basil and filling with the fresh made pasta and 4 shrimp, 1 Risotto's (ree-ZOHT-oh's) with delicious and perfectly cooked crab and scallops, 2 Rigatoni (ree-gah-TOH-neh) that had a flavorful vegetable bolognese, & 1 Veal Chop. Food came out all at once and presentation was on point. 2 stars to the chef!  My husband AND one of my friends had been in talks with the manager a month before to find out if Giada would be in and to arrange a \"Happy Birthday\" dessert. Our server knew it was my birthday, the hostess knew, it was on our reservation and even on Twitter! 20 minutes after the bill had been paid and everyone was ready to leave, my poor husband had to stall everyone from getting up and had to talk to whomever was in-charge that night and would listen to find out what happened to the birthday dessert. As we're leaving they finally brought out a chocolate dessert. Do not come here to celebrate a birthday-- they won't acknowledge it even if you're willing to pay for it. Painstakingly, awkward and embarrassing end to a hefty dinner. Minus 2 stars.   In the words of Giada, (di-SAS-tro).",

Cromwell is nice, small in size, decor black and red tones with leather. Entry to restaurant up large white walled (non-inviting) escalators to Hostess and open kitchen/Bar area,(very impressive). I greeted Hostess and said I have reservations for 815 and I was local and asked for a window/view table please ( I put this request on my TableOne email). Her response: whines, \"I can't guarantee that -it depends on when tables clear-I'll try\". I said thanks and headed to bar to wait. Well, being a LOCAL- that response 95% of the time means I need to 'tip'. I walked back, shook her hand, with nice tip handed to her while I asked her to \"please make sure we get a good view table\". She withdrew her hand like I burned her and said \"oh I CANT TAKE THAT\"..as I look for a hidden camera....I told her with surprise..\"oh, sorry no insult intended. I'm local and know how things usually work\" Said I was sorry, and asked please for a nice table. Go to bar, 4-5 people come by to do different 'stuff' at our little seating area, we order, 10 min at least pass, not busy in bar, no drinks yet. Another gal then shows up and says table is ready. WE have to get the drinks served, cash out tab, then follow to our table. Head towards dining room (lovely views) take a quick right to end of a hall-type area with about 8 two top tables. We are placed at the very last one with my shoulder almost bumping the shoulder of the lady sitting by the \"window\" crappy view area (oh my back to 'window). I told host I will not eat right against another's back. She moved us to the table across from them in this 'hallway'. Food. Ok. Portions might fill up a bird. Pasta is cheap and so is bread. I have lived here 10 years and atmosphere / ambience means everything. We got screwed. We were given the WORSE table in the restaurant. I walked thru the 'real restaurant' on the way out, beautiful....Too bad I didn't feel like we had 'that' experience. This was my special Christmas present to my guy..waah, wah- FAIL.  Thanks Giada for making my 'gift' a 'crap memory'. Overall -2 Stars Food- 3 Stars Service- 3 Stars Ambiance- 1 Star",

We arrived 45 minutes before our scheduled reservation to have drinks in the bar area.  The drinks were good (blue velvet and prosecco), but our waitress spilled my entire glass of water on me.  After that, she avoided us like the plague.  For the next 1.5 hours until they actually seated us (they were 45 minutes past our reservation), I sat in a cold and wet dress with no drinks (she never came back to check on us or refill my water).  She literally would pass by us even though we tried to get her attention multiple times.  When we finally sat down our waiter hardly spoke English.  He kept looking around and barely would answer our questions for the menu.  After taking our order, he didn't return to check on us until dessert.  Again, he just stood there and couldn't really answer our questions about dessert.  Since I had been there before, I knew the lemon cookies were the best so we ordered the cookie plate again.  I've liked Giada for years.  I watch her cooking shows on a regular basis and own many of her cookbooks and I was very disappointed in this second visit.  I hope service improves for future customers and they do not have to sit through a whole dinner in cold, wet clothes.",

This Italian man actually said it was bete than his mom's!  A couple of our kids had the Buccatini, another had the lemon spaghetti...omg it what so yummy.  I was concerned the lemon would be over powering but it was subtle and creamy.  I had the Branzino..melted in my mouth.    The dessert cart brought fun selections and we all tried the PB&J tiramisu, polenta cake, cookies...all fabulous.    The Windows were open and remarkably it was cool with a nice breeze.

I was hoping to get another caprese salad, because it was amazing. Unfortunately, we we're sat in  Billy's section, \"William D\" when it appears on your receipt. He was the rudest waitor I have ever had and had the worst attitude towards me asking it it was possible to have the caprese salad I had the night before. He was condescending and quite the jerk. We brought my parents with me who don't typically do the over priced food but because we raved about they came too. They were equally offended by his attitude and then never came back to check on is once our food was there or to bring out check. We had to ask other servers for to go boxes and our checks. My husband tends to give people the benefit of the doubt and gave him a 20% tip because we did notice he was spread out and we assumed he tried to back off because we were all pissed. But instead he MANUALLY entered a $60 tip on a $33 dollar bill, after we left which means he saved our CC info. He committed fraud and now we have to deal with it. I would like to think that calling the restaurant would get that scum bag fired but I doubt it will.  How disgusting. If you go for dinner, the food is wonderful and the atmosphere is great however I was disappointed with the menu items, the prices and the service for brunch.",

    "text": "I may be completely biased because Giada is my favorite celebrity chef, but I would say we had an amazing experience dining at her new restaurant at the Cromwell.  We had an early reservation (5PM).  We were asked to wait about 5-10 min for our table to be ready, but to alleviate the wait time, they had a (free) photo booth in the hostess area to play with while we wait.  You can either print pictures for free or email them to yourself.  I thought that was a cute idea and a good keepsake for your restaurant experience!  The restaurant itself is very beautiful, elegant, and airy.  It was bright and had great view of the Las Vegas Strip (particularly the famous Bellagio fountains).  I love how the fresh pastas, cheeses, meats, breads, etc were displayed Italian-deli style up front.  Every where you look, you will see Giada's name or her signature \"G\" everywhere (on chairs, plates, napkins, even on the pens they give you to sign your bill).  Seems a bit much, but I can't lie and say I didn't love it.  While most reviewers criticized the service, I would say our service was great.  I like the iPad concept where you can visually see the drinks and appetizers without relying on the descriptions on the menu.  I ordered the signature Giada cocktail and my cousin and friend got some wine.  They served us an amazing assortment of breads, butter, capers, and pesto sauce to start off with.  That rosemary bread in the dutch oven was my favorite!    I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because here is what we ordered between the three of us: Fresh Ricotta Crostini, Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizette, Arugula Salad, and Lemon Potatoes to share.  I ordered the Risotto with crab and scallops for my entree, my cousin the Tortellini, and my friend the Spaghetti.  I would say out of all our dishes that Spaghetti was the best.  It was light, lemony, and came with two HUGE prawns.  Plus the portion size was great.  You can tell Giada used her love of lemons to incorporate into her recipes at the restaurant.  I loved it.   The dessert cart was impressive, but by the time dessert \"rolled around\" (ha ha), we were all so full.  We picked a tiny little cheesecake to share between the three of us.  The cheesecake reminded me of cheesecake I've had in Italy.  It's light, creamy, but not very \"cream cheesy\" if that makes any sense. It was really fresh.    All in all it was such a great experience, and I would recommend all foodies and lovers of Giada to go check it out!",

The apps were above average dates wrapped in bacon, bell peppers stuffed with goat cheese. My dish was the pappardelle. It was construction well bruised short ribs and the tangerine was a really nice surprise and you don't taste it in every bite which I think is better that way.

    "text": "There's a photo booth while you wait. The dining area was very open and felt fresh.  The bread and condiments were very tasty. My favorite was the flat cracker looking one! It tasted so good!  I tried the Wood Roasted Mushrooms, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Arugula salad, and had the La Strada cocktail. I don't recommend the Wood Roasted Mushrooms at all because $14 was too expensive for something that didn't taste too special and came in such a small platter. The Bacon Wrapped Dates were my favorite out of what was ordered. It was very flavorful, but it was TOO overwhelming that I got sick of it after 2 pieces. The Arugula salad was pretty good too but it had absolutely too much parmigiano-reggiano which made the salad too cheesy. Although I really liked the candied lemon and pancetta in the salad. I think it would be hard to eat this entire salad by yourself because it's too cheesy. La Strada was easy to drink and fruity and sweet, but kinda too sweet.  Overall, I enjoyed eating at Giada, but I'm not sure if I will be coming back. I felt like this restaurant was only good for tasting things and not so much for having an actual meal. I recommend coming here with another person or a group and share the food with each other. Most of the dishes are actually tasty, but can get overwhelming.",

    "text": "I love Giada (the chef) and was afraid her first restaurant would end up being a disappointment. I'm glad to now officially say that she exceeded my expectations! I really wasn't expecting much from the food. I checked out the menu in advance and none of the dishes impressed me. That is, until I tasted the food.   Let me first say that I was extremely surprised that my group and I were even allowed in the restaurant. We had a reservation for 5 on a busy Friday evening. Due to heavy traffic, we had no time to stop at our hotel to change for dinner and showed up looking like a hot mess: t-shirts, flip flops, basketball shorts, sweaty, etc. I, personally, hadn't even brushed my hair all day. So kudos to the hostesses for not laughing us out of the restaurant when we showed up. I wish I could say that I was also blown away by the wait staff but that is sadly not the case. It took at least 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us after we were seated and even longer for us to get some water. If anything at the restaurant needs improvement, it's definitely the table service.  Now, on to the food. We were a hungry bunch and wanted to try everything: orzo meatballs, calamari, tomato & strawberry jam crostini, margherita pizzette, tricolore salad, spaghetti, ravioli, and an assortment of desserts from the cart. The best items of the evening were the meatballs, pizzette, spaghetti and ravioli. The ingredients were simple but delicious. My only complaint (and you'll see this in many other reviews) is the price. Subtract one dollar sign and I would definitely be eating here every time I'm in Vegas.",

They offered for us to take it to go with us, but we said no.   Watching the Ellen show today was on point. You could see everything they tried of her's was inedible and kept spitting it out.

Her name, signature, and picture are all over the resturant including lights, walls, napkins, placemats, dishes, some cocktails, etc.  I ate with 2 other friends and we ordered 5 antipasti dishes:  1) stuffed peppers - the winner of the night.  the filling was great and the peppers had a nice crunch.  2) lobster rolls - fried with a nice crispy outer edge.  3) meatballs - nice and delicate  4) buratta cheese - very soft and chewy  5) mushroom pizza - ok but fairly typical for wood fired pizza.  For our pastas, we got:  1) tortellini - vegetarian.  my dining friend said it was good but i didn't try it.  2) lemon spaghetti - the shrimp / prawns are huge and really made this dish special.  the pasta were ok but a little too thick and stuck together.  i would have preferred the sauce to be a little more liquid.  3) rigatoni w/ vegetable bolognese - mediocre.  the bolognese sauce just wasn't all that good to me.  We were too full to order mains.  For dessert we got:  1) banana gelato - very good.  2) tiramisu (forgot which one) - also very good.  3) small round nutty thing with edible gold (forgot the name) - pretty good but the chocolate filling was a little much so i had a bite and didn't want any more.  Bill was around $300 for 3 people including the above + 3 cocktails.  Service was excellent.  The bar area was also nice and we had an exceptional bar hostess.    They use ipads in the bar as menus but the application is very buggy and crashes a lot.  They need better IT as ours crashed a bunch of times.  Hostess was also awesome.  I originally had a reservation for 2 but another friend came along last minute.  I wasn't sure if they would be able to seat us but the hostess got it done.  Excellent work!  I will be back.",

I had seen that many yelpers recommended the lemon spaghetti so I tried it.  Go to Giada's and get the lemon spaghetti.  JUST ORDER IT.  It was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and will take you to a piazza in Italy!  We also tried the vegetable bolognese, branzino and the lamb.  Everything was excellent!!!  Giada has hit it out of the park!  The restaurant is gorgeous, the service excellent, and the food superb.  The only thing I did not care for was the iPads to order the antipasto.  It was awkward and confusing to use.  Also, beware, the waiter poured us sparking water and didn't bother to ask if that's what we wanted.  We drank it, and we were charged for it.",

The food and service were exceptional and the environment with the views was perfect for this special occasion. Kevin, our server, was kind, knowledgeable and welcoming during the entire meal, from drink suggestions to the desert display, he really went above and beyond to make our dinner feel special.  We had the seafood risotto and lobster ravioli and I fully recommend them both. The risotto was al dente and the scallops cooked perfectly while the ravioli was a wonderfully blend of asparagus lobster and tarragon without any of the ingredients being overpowering. Kevin recommended our cocktails, the Destroyer ( which was like a tangerine margarita) and the La Strada ( which was a light and fruity limoncello) and we ordered the artichoke arancini, which were delicious. All in all, we would come back and explore the other items on the menu, because of the wonderful experience we had last night.",

    "text": "Ugh! I have been putting off writing this review but tonight sat down to finish off all my reviews of my check ins. This one is the tough one because every one loves this place so much but here goes........ I did not care for this restaurant at all. I visited on Dec 2, 2014 at 6pm reservation so I had flown from Houston to Vegas arriving at noon and I had been up since 5am Houston time so by the time I got here I was exhausted so I am hoping that had to do with my bad experience. I was seated with very little wait. the place is so beautiful but hard to tell because it is so DARK! I had to pull out my iPhone to light up my menu and my food and I never have to do that! I was brought some bread to start and guy delivering bread told me to be careful because bread in little cast iron skillet was extremely hot so to let it cool I ate a few of the hard sticks of bread which I hate. So I feel top of bread in skillet and it is barely warm, so I pull it out and break it in half and it is ice, ice cold! So much for my hot bread. It is good though but better hot I am sure.  I started with the Orzo Meatballs with pomodoro sauce. The meatballs were dry and tasted like Sams warehouse meatballs in a bag. Sauce was good. I wanted to try veal chop Milanese style and the waiter said it was cooked to a medium temp was that ok with me? yes I said medium is fine. Also ordered lemon potatoes. The chop arrived and it was huge. Also just a huge chunk of meat coated in bread crumbs with no sauce. So I cut in and take a bite and it is chewy and tastes like saw dust but I am hungry so I try another bite same deal but even chewier so I whip out my cell phone to look at it and it is raw!!  Now I hate hate hate sending things back so I don't even want to mess with it but I did call waiter over and show him the raw slab of meat on my plate. He apologizes and wants to send it back to re cook it but I am done by this time so I just tell him it is ok I will just try dessert. He also says that Giada was going to be visiting next day and she would be horrified by the rawness. I doubt he told her! lol Potatoes were bland and had no lemon flavor whatsoever. So maybe dessert will be better.........Nope! I got the deconstructed lemon meringue pie and it was dry and blah! Waiter was way too busy to give good service or maybe because I was single woman by myself but he was good enough to take chop off the ticket.  Hopefully this was isolated incident and next time I am in Vegas I will give Giada's another try.",

    "text": "I was so excited to bring my best friend to Giada for her birthday. However, the entire meal was ruined by our awful server. We waited 30 minutes past our reservation time, which I can accept for such a busy place, but it would have been nice if there had been any acknowledgement of the wait at all. Especially considering it was 6:15 and I had made reservations 2 months in advance. Instead, I watched as the hostesses twirled their hair and looked bored. My bestie and I looked past this though as I had been previously in August and had a fun and delicious meal. Once we finally got seated our waiter came to greet us. He was very friendly, telling us all about the menu and the wine. This demeanor changed immediately upon learning we were not drinking alcohol. I couldn't drink and my friend did not want to drink without me. I was however still very prepared to eat a ton and indulge!  We no longer had this urge after receiving just our drinks. I ordered an ice tea which my mother ordered upon my visit previously. The presentation then was so beautiful and I was looking forward to it again, something I mentioned to our waiter. A few minutes later he returned with a diet coke and my tea. I know tea, I drink tea with breakfast lunch and dinner, and this was not good tea. It was bitter and over brewed and tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. I let our waiter politely know, this seemed to annoy him further, and waited. Upon his return he carried the full presentation I had been expecting the first time! He then tells me without any hint of apology, \"He didn't know where the tea bags were so he just gave you what the cooks were drinking.\" Then he just walked away! He didn't present the tea the way the other waiter had and he acted like getting served what the cooks were drinking was acceptable for 6 dollars!  We proceeded to order the dates with sausage and marscapone and parmesan and honey for appetizers. These were both ok but I don't think we enjoyed them much wondering what type of kitchen they came out of. We each ordered just a pasta because our appetites were quickly being ruined by the continued attitude from our waiter. These were both very good, the bucatini and the tortellini were fresh and perfectly al dente.  Once finished with our pastas I was still hoping to salvage the meal with my favorite part of my previous experience: the dessert cart. However, in an attempt to get us to spend more (which we would have had our waiter not been a jerk) we were handed the dessert menu instead. Each dessert was twice the price ($12-$14) as on the dessert tray ($6) plus we didn't get the fun of seeing all the beautiful desserts! We decided not to order anything due to overall disappointment with the experience. Once we said no to dessert our waiter did not utter a single word to us. I could not believe how rude and unprofessional he was. I guess he didn't think we had spent enough to care about our tip, so that at least saved me some money. Such high hopes, and I won't be back. So many other delicious places in Vegas with great service. Don't waste your money or your time unless you like being treated poorly.",

    "text": "Giada Should Be Ashamed!  Several months ago, we went to Giada's  Restaurant and had a very nice breakfast with excellent service.  Based on our previous visit, we went back again. What a disappointment!  We made a reservation for 9am which was the time the restaurant opened.  Even though there were only two other parties waiting to be seated, it took the 2 hostesses about 10 minutes to seat us at our table.  We had menus and waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to ask us if we wanted coffee and what we wanted to order.  There were several waiters in the room and only 3 tables of 2 people each and a large party of about 15 people. He acted as if he was doing us a favor by taking our order.  We told him we had come back to enjoy the delicious donuts we had had last time.  He told us Giada did not serve them for breakfast anymore.  I asked about other sweets and he said that they had a pastry basket.    We ordered our meal. They brought our omelet and bread with no butter or jam.  We finally were able to flag down the waiter and asked for butter, jam, and more coffee.  By the time he came back, our entrees and toast was cold.  At 9:45, when the restaurant had only been open 45 minutes, we ordered the pastry basket.  The waiter came back and told us there were no more because the large party had taken them all.  I asked if we could have the donuts or any other muffin or sweet. He said he had nothing to offer.  I went to the hostess and asked her to send the manager to our table.  His name was Frank Gibase.  He said that the waiter was wrong because what had happened was that the chef had burnt most of the pastries in the morning when  he was making them so they couldn't serve them.  The few that were not burned went to the large party.  I again asked if we could have the donuts or any other sweet.  He hardly acknowledged that there was a problem and didn't even apologize for our disappointment.  We will never go back.",

My sister and I sat in the window with GORG views during lunch hour. We ordered the chicken meatballs and I literally have never had anything so good. They were perfect, creamy, huge flavor...YUM! Small portions, but I expected that. Then we shared the spinach and ricotta pizza with pancetta on top. The dough was KILLER! I loved it, I didn't care for the meat so much, but overall it was very tasty. Our waiter was so nice. He knew we were huge Giada fans so he packed us a \"fan bag!\" It had pens, a few napkins to take and her take out bags that are just as adorable. It was super nice, he said she was there on Monday and Tuesday of that same week. She goes to each table, takes pictures and talks with all of the guests. SO BUMMED I missed that.   Can I just say my favorite thing about this place was the decor. It was BEAUTIFULLY decorated. Everything was perfect. I need my house to look like that ;) I will go back and try something new on the menu for sure. I loved my non-alcoholic strawberry basil concoction too. Thumbs up G!",

Don't get me wrong I don't need a Cheesecake Factory dictionary sized menu, but something more than pizza and salads would be nice. It's winter and they have grilled cheese but not even a soup to go with it... when I asked for a soup the server said \"Giada hasn't approved it yet.\" Uhm ok. I don't want to make a negative review, nothing was terrible, but three stars pretty much sums it up. We had the antipasto platter and it was alright. Very little meat for a large platter... you're buying bread and a few olives and a mixture of some sort and enough cheese for 2 mice. Most of us got pizzas (carbonara and one other I can't remember) and they were a lot of bread and little flavor. Bottom line is that it was a pretty pricy lunch and I would have been just as satisfied with Olive Garden and a bit more full. Maybe dinner is where it's at with this place?",

The weather was perfect, the windows were open and we were lucky enough to have a table with a gorgeous view of the sunset and the Bellagio fountains.   We started by sharing the lemon ricotta crostini with prosciutto.  This was so delicious, I believe I will go back just to enjoy an array of their small plates.  For an entree I had the recommended lemon spaghetti and it was well worth it.  The portion size was plenty, with two enormous shrimp and delicious pasta.  I also want to mention the great bread plate, as there was obviously effort put into making this special. The only disappointment was dessert.  The selections looked fairly boring, but we decided to split the tart with apples three-ways and cinnamon gelato.  It was quite awful.  I asked the server what the \"third-way\" was, since it obviously only had an apple chip and a large chunk of dry apple on top of dry puff pastry.  He admitted that their probably wasn't a \"third way\".  If this was indicative of their other sweet offerings, steer clear of dessert.",

    "text": "I am a real customer here and yelp removed my previous review saying that it \"lacks a firsthand customer experience at this location\"... can you believe that??! How the hell can yelp tell me that this was not a first hand experience?!  A repeat of my review about my FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE here at Giadas: I'm basing this review solely on the grossly overpriced menu. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants and steakhouses in the US and none of them come close to the outrageous prices charged at Giadas. I'm all for paying good money for a meal, but $75 for a bone in ribeye or $35+ for a plate of pasta portioned the size of an appetizer (just look at some of the pictures) is just absurd.  Sure, it's a good steak.... that's right.. I ATE IT!! But it's not even close to justifying its price. I'm pretty much disappointed with almost all the food network star restaurants and Giadas has managed to make it to the top of the list. All these guys cross promote each other to fuel their own pockets. Way to ride the fame bandwagon and lure people in with your TV name. Shame on you.   More detail about MY FIRST HAND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. They have a seating area overlooking the strip. The kitchen is right out in the open for a \"showy\" atmosphere. The Hostesses where grey heels with short white friffy dresses that have holes in them. There was a 30 minute wait last Saturday afternoon and we didn't even have to make a reservation to get a seat. We had a $14 arugula salad, I ate a bone in Ribeye with a egg on-top of it sprinkled with arugula and my friend had the lemon pasta which came with two prawns and looked like an appetizer. Side of lemon potatoes and the Tiramisu which came in a tiny shot glass and an espresso to finish off our underwhelming meal. I drank coke, she had a fancy drink.. the total came out right under $200. Everything tasted good... not amazing... will I write about how I felt about each and every item?? No... because explanation can justify being reamed not only in price.. but portions as well. I've paid good money for great food.. but I've never seen outrageous prices unless it was a special day like V-Day... in which case I guess we can justify paying $100+ a person... for a filling meal at least.  We went to Gordon Ramsays Steak the night after and had a wonderful and FILLING meal for two for less than$140. Portions were larger and we even had leftovers... Something I couldn't imagine happens a lot here at Giadas.  GIADAS IS A PAID YELP ADVERTISER. They made a complaint to remove my legitimate negative review about a REAL experience here at Giadas. How can you say I didn't eat here when I know what their food tastes like and that they serve measily portions for top shelf prices. We left hungry and spent a couple hundred for a meal for two.",

The service was mediocre at best, the bus boy took plates from the table as we were still eating and the food was OK. The risotto was the highlight of the meal, I had the lamb and the wife had the lemon spaghetti w/ shrimp. The shrimp were dry, and the $51 plate of lamb was cooked perfectly but, that was about it.

We shared the crostada for desert and it was super tasty. We didn't start with cocktails, we ordered them once we were done and put them in plastic cups to take with us. Hey, it's Vegas, right?

My nephew got the Italian fried chicken and it was a very dark brown. I wondered if it tasted burnt?  The pasta dishes were just ok - nothing was special.

Service  10-10 Food 10-10  Atmosphere  10-10  We got the pre- fix menu was $120 a person for a 4 course meal sounds expensive but worth every bite. I couldn't stop eating and was was so full I had to pack the rest.   The lemon spaghetti was amazing along with the salmon I had. Also the apps were Bacon  wrapped Italian sausage , stuffed peppers , and we had the oysters Rockefeller.  Desert was any three choices off the cart. Omg Delish. You can tell it was made from scratch  Great overall !",

The service was very slow and we we had to flag down a waiter to help us repeatedly. We had three or four different servers while we were and the meal took 2 hours and 40 minutes for an appetizer and pasta dishes.   The octopus salad was over charred and a bit rubbery and the potatoes with it tasted old and tangy. The arancini balls were fine - a bit too much lemon zest - but not bad. The olives were also covered in lemon zest. The pastas were just ok. The bucatini was chewy, the rigatoni was salty and mediocre, and the risotto was fine.  In the end the bill for my meal alone with tip was $93.00 for a meal that took way too long and was just ok. An overall disappointment for a place we all wanted to love. I'd recommend going to another place in Vegas for the money you would spend.",

    "text": "We had a 10:45 reservation yesterday, got there a few minutes early & they seated us right away as no one was waiting & there were seats available. The young lady sat the 4 of us at a 4 top. Another man came & got our drink orders & told us the waitresses name. She came & took our order & very quickly figured out how to access the Groupons to validate them off my phone. She took our order...I bought 3 of the Brunch Tasting Menu Groupon's...so I told her we wanted one of each since there are 3 choices for the appetizer & entree & dessert...she totally understood what I was going for...we also ordered a spaghetti with meatballs...  now...onto the food... They brought out the appetizers & pastries first...I was a little disappointed in the amount of food considering it was supposed to be 3 tasing menus & the couple next to us got 2 tasting menus & it looked like they had way more food then we did...(unless they ordered an appetizer separate...idk...) anyway...there was 3 pieces of prosciutto, 3 deviled eggs, 5 chunks of parmesan cheese, 3 pastries & a small salad...the eggs were probably the smoothest deviled eggs I've ever had...the cheese was amazing...so was the salad & the prosciutto...then the entrees arrived...we didn't really care for the burger...the meat had noooo seasoning at all...we got the \"zucchini fries\" as a side & forgot & were wondering what the side was...tasted like onion strings...or super thin french fries...we later realized it was zucchini...they were really good...the pasta was amazing...as was the salmon cakes with perfectly poached eggs ...my daughters spaghetti & meatballs was just ok...you would think it would be way better since Giada is always cooking pasta on her show...anyway... desert...the lemon cookies with ice cream in the middle was by far the best of the 3....the souffle was just ok...& the coffee ice cream cake tasted like it was made with realllllllyyyy strong coffee... The service was excellent...my ice tea was always kept full as was our waters...the staff was very nice... After we were all done they boxed up our leftovers & brought them in a very nice bag... the waitress advised us that she was just waiting for someone else to take off the $117 for the 3 Groupons...(please remember to tip on the FULL AMOUNT of the bill as if you didn't have a coupon...) so I still owed another $40 something with Groupon plus the tip I owed $90.... So, why the 4 stars??  1) the amount of food for what would have been about $215 plus the tip was not really worth the money. 2) I like capers...I do...but they had them in 2 of the dishes...the salad & the pasta... 3) the spaghetti was just ok...mine is actually better... 4) the burger was cooked perfectly but it didn't seem like there was any seasoning on or in the meat...it was just meat...& they put giant pieces of sauteed onions on the burger...like almost an inch wide & 3 inches long pieces...purple onions... I also want to say that I had asked on yelp whether or not I could use 3 or 4 Groupons at the same time & if this weekend counted as a holiday weekend (fine print of the Groupon) & someone from Giada's got back to me rather quickly with a response that yes, I could use 3 or 4 Groupons & that yes I could use them this weekend as this weekend didn't count as a holiday weekend...so I was happy with that... I also bought the Groupons just a couple of days before we went to eat at Giada's... Overall the atmosphere was very nice...as was all of the wait staff...",

The food was really good, very tasty. The pasta was so fresh. I think the pasta and scallops were a highlight for us. The downside of Giada's is that while the food was really good, the pricing was really high. It's definitely a place to check out, but I can't be a regular.",

    "text": "Was not what I was expecting. I know you shouldn't put expectations on anything but I really wanted to try her restaurant because of her!  First off, this place is beautifully decorated. You are welcomed by a large hostess area and there is even a photo booth to the left of the hostess stand to capture your experience.   We arrived for dinner around 5:45pm on Saturday and they had a 2 piece band playing top 40 hits. Was a really cool vibe.  Now let's get to why I only gave this place 3 stars. Service was incredibly snooty and slow. Our server was not personable at all. We did not even get a table touch from the manager. When you check in on Yelp you either get a splash of prosecco or a cookie plate for the table. When I asked what the cookie plate included I couldn't even get an answer.   We ordered the small cheese plate off the antipasti menu and that was yummy but you can't really mess up a cheese plate.  We tried the lamb, risotto and ravioli and all were flavorless. Felt like I was eating cardboard. My son had the rigatoni off the kids menu and he liked it.   Also, enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake, so pastry was a safe bet as well.   All in all, I'm glad I tried it but will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone.",

    "text": "This restaurant is in an absolutely gorgeous space in one of my favorite hotels on the strip, The Cromwell. It's bright and airy, with lovely booths and tables facing the strip through elegant open windows. It's really a pleasure to dine in this space.   I'm giving it three stars because I've dined here twice and both times the service was really poor. Once was a busy weekday lunch time, so I thought they were just slammed. The food and vibe was good enough that I took some friends back to try again this weekend. The place was pretty empty on a Saturday at 11:15 am, but inexplicably, our service was still terrible.   We ordered drinks at the bar and they asked us to close out before going to our table. Maybe the server ignored us because we already had drinks, but we were prepared to order lots of food and lots more drinks if he'd been attentive. Two of my friends ordered coffees at two different times during our meal and the server forgot both; after a reminder about his missing order, my husband was given a cold cappuccino that the server admitted had been sitting in the kitchen for a while because he'd forgotten it.   A friend ordered a cocktail (a Brown Derby) and the server came back twice to ask what the ingredients were and then told us that the bartender was googling it, which, while I'm sure was True, did not inspire a lot of confidence. We spent over an hour sitting at our table before we ordered our entrees. We did eat their delicious charcuterie and cheese plate during this time (the truffle-infused burrata...wow) but spent a lot of it doing the awkward neck-craning to flag our waiter so we could order more.   My dish (the salmon avocado toast) came with a side salad, but since my friends had all ordered starter salads, the server politely suggested that he could bring my side salad out first along with theirs. Excellent, except he forgot and did not bring it first. Then he remembered and brought it while my friends were finishing theirs.   We also ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter brought us the wrong bottle. None of the service issues were by themselves a big deal, but the large number of mistakes across only a small number of orders was frustrating, especially at a place where the price point is so high. Genuinely, I hope this place can get its act together with some better servers and management because it has so much potential. They have a lovely space and a creative menu, but I'm not rushing back.",

The only thing I'll give this place is the ambiance, which was nice. Otherwise, I can't say I enjoyed it very much. The food was ok, but for the price you pay it really isn't worth it. Our veal chop was super dry, our ravioli had no real flavor and the drinks (while tasty) had I'm guessing zero alcohol in them.   I did like the Risotto and the Gorgonzola Dolce, but otherwise I wasn't much of a fan. For the price, there are much better/tastier place in Vegas.   Stay Cheerful ;)",

With the exception of a glass water and the initial welcome, we didn't see our waiter again until we had been there for 30 min. He took our drink order and before we could order appetizers he was gone. 20 min after he took our drink order the drinks arrive, but still no sign of our waiter. I finally flag down another waiter and ask to order some food as we'd been there for literally an hour. He was shocked and starts taking our appetizer and dinner orders. Our actual waiter pops up out of nowhere like David Bowie in the Labrynth, throwing attitude because someone else was helping his table. He gets snarky saying he was waiting until we had our drinks to take our food order. We order and the food comes out relatively quickly. Our waiter came by twice while we ate, but then pulled his disappearing act. At the two hour mark we were ready to order dessert. At the 2.5hr mark we actually get to order dessert. In all, we were there for just over 3 hours.  You'd think with a review like above I'd never go back, but the food was SO AMAZING. Every single thing I ate was beyond divine. Next time I'll just make sure we don't get that waiter.",

When you first enter, you'll notice all the little touches with Giada's name, from the carts to the napkins. The views are amazing because it faces Las Vegas Blvd.   Now on the the food, it was overall a great experience. The server was very knowledgeable and suggested we order a few of their appetizers as these are tapas style, small plates. We ordered the chicken meatballs, grilled octopus, bruschetta with burrata cheese, eggplant parmigiana, and sausage pizza to start. The eggplant parmigiana was so good that my friend that hates eggplants had seconds. The pizza was also a highlight. The rest were good, just didn't wow us.   For the entrees we had the steak, lobster ravioli and 2 orders of the Branzino. Our friends that has been there before told me that the Branzino is awesome, and they were right. The skin was amazingly crisp without drying out the meat. The steak was cooked perfectly. The lobster ravioli was a disappointment. The pasta was way to al dente. It was hard and made it quite brittle when cutting into it. Even though I can see the filling had lobster, I couldn't taste it. Could've skipped it.",

The ambience was perfect, and the view of the strip was beautiful. Our server, Lauren, was absolutely amazing and very knowledgeable of the food, and gave great reccommendations.    I didn't give it 5 stars because with our first course, the antipasto platter, the chef accidentally got a hard shell from the seafood station (which I guess is right next to where they prepare the antipasto platter).  My husband ended up biting into this shell, and it was pretty unpleasant.  The manager quickly brought us a fresh plate, but all they offered us was to ask if we wanted to make a statement.  We decided not to, and to try and enjoy the rest of the courses since we love Giada, but it still took time for him to get comfortable.   They also forgot to give us our envelopes with the recipes that come with the tasting menu.    The dishes and flavor is why I'm giving it three stars.  If the shell incident hadn't happened, would have been 5 stars.",

The lemon souffle dessert, they warn you it takes about 20 minutes to make....definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "Giada at the Cromwell is worth the visit. Whether you're paying $1 an ounce for veal or $15 a cocktail you'll be happy.   I highly suggest securing a reservation on your own or with a casino host and ask for a premium table- you will be blown away by the view.   From the moment you make your way up the escalator and greeted by a host with a short skirt you feel this is not your ordinary Las Vegas Restaurant.   There's a photo booth set up but now currently usable but you can still take pics with your own camera.   The entrance is welcoming as you see the Sous chefs preparing food and next to it the huge bar and lounge area. The dining area itself has a great layout with great samples of art. The decor is simple yet very elegant. With views of Flamingo Avenue and Las Vegas Blvd.   There are booths in the Al Fresco section and small tables in the other section.   Keep in mind if you want a premium seat you must order at least $100 per person in food and beverage which is easily met with the Taster Menu. You'll get a dessert cart where you can have everything that your sweet tooth desires. Also, you'll get a special personally signed photo menu from Giada.   If you're looking for huge portions this isn't the place for you but if you're looking for savory flavor, Giada's favorites will definitely surprise you. The salads and appetizers packed so much taste...  The entrees were again scrumptious!   I want to add that Valentino and his crew were very excellent in terms of providing service. Our drinks were topped off and were asked if we needed anything else about every 10-15 minutes. Plates were cleared etc...   I'm not sure why this place has a few two star reviews... Maybe my wife and I were lucky, we were impressed not disappointed. We will be back again when in Vegas.   If you haven't had visited Giada - trust me, you must give this place a try.   I no longer believe the saying of \"never trust a skinny chef!\"   Giada, if you read this review...  Thank you Giada for putting a great restaurant on the strip. My wife was happy, therefore I was too.  Wish we came in a week ago to be able to meet you. Your restaurant, like you is beautiful! Thanks",

    "text": "We got there exactly at 10:31, but apparently missed eating in the dining area by one minute. The bar and lounge area was open though with the full menu available to us though. Our waitress was very pleasant and very attentive. There was a nice range of different music playing from Backstreet Boys to Frank Sinatra. I really enjoyed the ambience and the decor was lovely. They had a few tv screens on and had sports playing on one screen and a Bollywood film playing on another. We didn't have to wait long to order.   I checked into Yelp and we got a complimentary glass of prosecco. I ordered one of Giada's special drinks called the Destroyer and my brother just got a rum and coke. It had tequila. It was okay, a little bit too sweet for me. Before appetizers, they brought out some rolls and these pita chips, with little sides of I think sour cream, olive tapenade, chili peppers, olive oil, and rock salt. Not sure why the salt. It was tasty and seasoned enough.   For appetizers, we had the Lemon Crab Arancini and Crispy Oysters Rockefeller.  The crab were basically cheese balls, not what I was expecting. The Oysters with the spinach mixture was tasty and creamy. Next we had the Lemon Chicken soup. A bowl was brought out with I think carrot, pasta, and chicken bits, and then the waiter poured the clear broth after. It was surprisingly pleasant, with a nice lemony bite to it.   Finally, for our main courses we had Mint Lasagne (lamb ragu with whipped citrus) and Salmon (pan roasted with golden beet pureed & pistachio vinaigrette). My brother also ordered a side of Creamy Polenta. I did not like the lamb at all. It was just a bowl of pasta squares with a pile of lamb pieces. It was way too heavy and not at citrusy. I didn't finish this dish. The salmon was quite good on the other hand. It was cooked perfectly and puree was a nice pair. The polenta was not worth it all.   Overall, I was not that impressed with this place, definitely not worth what we paid for, but you know celebrity chef + Las Vegas = extremely overpriced. I did enjoy the decor and ambiance though",

    "text": "Last weekend I was in Vegas for a girls weekend getaway to see Britney perform. It was an awesome weekend indeed!   My friend and I read about GIADA at The Cromwell and decided to go for brunch on our last day before flying out. I made a reservation on Open Table quite easily and when we arrived (early) we decided to have a seat at the bar and enjoyed our first drink!   We both had the Sangria which was delicious and refreshing. Erika had the white and I had the red. Its Giada's Classic Sangria- so yummy and refreshing; like I mentioned . Anyway, we then ordered some prosciutto, Gorgonzola, fruit and cheese crisps plates which boy!... was that to die for! Right up my alley, I'll say!   Our bartender Beau was awesome and very attentive to our needs. I had even noticed on yelp that with a check-in you get a Free Splash of Prosecco! So of course I jumped on that opportunity! Nothing like an easy check-in for a free sip of bubbly ... I honestly thought he would top us off after our Sangria but no, he gave us each a 1/2 glass full of Prosecco; super accomodative and generous.   We then... eventually ordered our brunch/lunch or whatever time it was by then and decided to stay at the bar rather than being moved to our table. Beau was quite attentive (as mentioned) and we enjoyed his company just as much as I'd say he enjoyed ours.   I had the Mortadella Pizza (Giada's classic) you can find it under the antipasti... but it's a perfect size for one or two depending how hungry you are. I really enjoyed it. A pizza- yes, but a light flat bread pizza with delicious salty meat and a light layer of white sauce underneath. Just the perfect combination when you wanna indulge, but not too much!    My friend had ordered the Sardinian gnocchi, however they accidentally brought her the lasagne, and when she mentioned that wasn't what she ordered, the waiter took it back immediately after apologizing and said no problem my mistake, we will get you that gnocchi! I mean of course they would do that right? But listen, common sense ain't so common these days if you know that I mean. The reaction time to correcting the mistake was smooth and flawless. Shortly after they brought her out the gnocchi; she was satisfied w/ a full tummy of warm, comfort food that leaves you wanting seconds.   At the end, we took advantage of the cute (roomy) photo booth right outside of the restaurant before you head down the escalators. Such a fun experience, ambiance and the food and service were awesome! I cannot say enough about this place... obviously! Oh, and before I forget, the ambiance of this place actually feels homey. It looks and feels inside as if you are in a gorgeously renovated, grand living room! Perhaps maybe something Giada herself has or at the very least envisions for her very own Italian Mansion  All I can say is that I loved everything about GIADA and I intend fully on going back in June when I return to Vegas! Thank you for such a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "I'd give this place 3.5 stars, rounded down to a 3 for this review.   This place is very contemporary-I love the decor. I like how you go up the escalators and are greeted by the hostesses up top and there is a photo booth on the left, which is a nice touch. I've never seen a restaurant with a photo booth. On the right is the restaurant, I love how spacious and modern it feels. I really liked the furniture and all the cups, plates, and utensils...you definitely felt like you were in a high end restaurant. I also like the windows surrounding the restaurant with so much light coming in. I came here for brunch so I can't speak for how it is here for dinner/the evening.   For brunch, they offer a sampler meal which is $45/person, which is a great deal if you are feeling hungry, but what I did not like is that if one person in your party orders a sampler than everyone in your party must order an appetizer and entree. I think this is ridiculous and hate being forced to order food. I was in a party of 8 and although one person wanted to order the sampler, he spared the rest of us being forced to order an appetizer and just ordered each item he wanted separately. They have bottomless mimosas for $30/person. Service was not so great, our server forgot our beverages and I had to ask someone else to bring them over. She seemed like she was just not paying very much attention that day. I believe the juice and coffee was $9 each, which was a bit steep-at least they were good.   On to the food, we really liked the meatball appetizer, but keep in mind that it is a very small dish. The carbonara pizza was amazing, and I would definitely order this again. The lasagna was also good, but a bit pricy for what you got but I did enjoy this dish. It was a small dish of lasagna that was not too cheesy (which was a good thing for me), and came with a small arugula salad with some shaved cheese. Overall this place is pricy, which is expected, but I wouldn't mind coming back here sometime.",

    "text": "I love Giada's show so when I heard she opened a restaurant in Vegas, I knew I had to give it a try. On a Saturday night, the earliest reservation we could get was 8:15pm but since it was Vegas, we didn't mind having a late dinner. We arrived 30 minutes early so we found a couch to sit on and sip on drinks before we were seated at our table. The drinks in the lounge area were decently priced $9-$12/drink and you ordered off an iPad which was kind of cool. Our server in the lounge also had a great personality!   We were seated about 5 minutes after 8pm and unfortunately were seated all the way in the back with absolutely no view. I suppose that would be my biggest complaint- the seating wasn't very comfortable at all. Our server was friendly and service was very quick which I appreciated. The bread basket was awesome with a small roll that had been baked in a mini cast iron pot (super cute!) and there were breadsticks and parmesan crisps which were awesome! Loved the sea salt and rosemary flavors.   For our appetizer we shared the Tenderloin Crostini which had a small slice of pickle and a potato chip on top- very cute but was just okay, it didn't surprise me at all. I had the Parpadelle with pork ragout and it was AMAZING!!!! I loved that the pasta was topped with arugula so there were some veggies incorporated. The pork was sooo tender. My boyfriend had the Three Cheese Tortellini that had Beef inside as well and though it was fairly heavy, he said it was really flavorful. We also shared the Spinach and Herb Soft Polenta with Spicy Italian Sausage as sides. Both were really great except the polenta didn't have much sausage in it. The most impressive item of our meal was the dessert- which was a Hazelnut Caramel Lemon Cake. It was an unusual pairing but it totally worked!   Overall, I enjoyed the meal but it was pretty pricey. I'm definitely glad we tried it but maybe will try something different next time around!",

    "text": "The first word that comes to mind about Giada is \"sexy\". I'm referring to the restaurant, not the celebrity chef, but I'm sure everyone would agree that both is True haha. Giada is located inside the Cromwell on one of the high floors so that you have a beautiful view of the strip if you're lucky enough to be seated by a window. The seating hostesses wear little tight dresses and the decor can only be described as sexy elegance from the walls to the plating of the dishes. The waitstaff are formal and professional.   Straight away, I was impressed with the bread service. You're served a beautiful plate with crispy breadsticks, bread crisps, and Giada's wonderfully moist and salty olive oil bread. Cocktails are presented on an iPad which is great if you're a visual person. We took advantage of the wine offerings and went with a crisp Chardonnay, chilled to the ideal temperature. Next we moved on to the Prosciutto di Parma, topped with apple slices and a healthy portion size. The perfectly soft Burrata had amazing flavor and was taken to the next level with the caper pesto on the plate. Eating these 2 dishes together made for the perfect start to our meal.   I knew that I couldn't pass on the Porcini Mushroom Soup. I expected a cream soup but was pleased to be served a light soup with chunks of hearty mushrooms, cannellini beans and sauteed escarole. If you're a fan of mushrooms as I am, this is a solid choice. As it was my first time dining at Giada, I had to try the simply titled Spaghetti. The thick noodles are lightly sauced with a thick lemon basil sauce and accompanied by 2 of the largest shrimp I have ever seen. I highly suggest this dish as I felt that each ingredient perfectly complimented the next and none overpowered the other. While the portion size wasn't out of control, I was still too full for dessert and nothing on that menu really called out to me. Overall, high marks for both the food and ambiance. I was here on a business dinner so the tasting menu was out of their budget, but I would love to return to try it out.",

He should have ordered his own instead of his bacon wrapped dates. ;) The dates were good. Spicy and a little sticky. But he could have eaten an entire bowl of my port soaked pears.   Main Entree: Flavorful and very tender short rib braised in Barolo, nestled in polenta, with roasted carrots and pearl onions on the side. It was comfort food at its best.  Perfect on a cool desert night.   My husband ordered the Veal Chop and was happy with it, but I loved my short rib more. I took two bites of his. The chop by itself and a bite of chop with the flash fried herbs. The flash fried herbs made the chop. Perhaps I'm biased with the opinion that the short rib was vastly superior. --I was in desperate need of comfort food that night and the veal chop just didn't satisfy enough.  Added Sides: Herb Polenta w/Spicy Sausage. Absolutely loved it. Loved it more than the polenta that accompanied my short rib. I left my own polenta alone and ate the side instead. Loved the herbs and the bites of sausage.   Roasted Fennel.... didn't love. Didn't even like. For being \"roasted\" there was no caramelization at all. Just white and hard. No flavor. It was the only thing on my plate that made me want to hide it like a 5 yr old would. Or slip it to my pup, but I don't think he'd have eaten it either.   If Giada's was located in Chicago, I'd go there yearly. No doubt. Since my parents live in Vegas and I'll visit regularly, coupled with my dad's love of gambling (too much), I *might* return. I can drag him away from blackjack and maybe back to Giada's. There are so many restaurants I haven't been to though!",

    "text": "First time eating at this restaurant. Had a reservation and was seated after maybe a 10-15 minute wait so it wasn't that bad. We were placed in an area where we could see the view outside, however, the experience was sort of ruined by that \"station\" where the waiters converged.  Our waiter/server for the night was Joseph. He was nice and professional and took the time to answer our questions about the dishes. He asked if it's our first time and what prompted us to dine at Giada. Told him we were celebrating our anniversary. He welcomed and congratulated us then moved on to taking our orders. We ordered drinks and then after a while, he came back to get the rest of our orders. We ordered the Crab Arancini as an appetizer.  He then asked us what we wanted to have for dinner. Told him we weren't ready as we haven't yet decided what to have. He responded by saying that the chef wants all the orders placed at the same time so he'll just come back to get the rest when we're ready. I thought that was odd. Normally, they put the appetizers in and then come back to take the orders for the main course. Nevertheless, he was back in no time to take our orders - Spaghetti (shrimp, mascarpone cheese, lemon and basil); Bucatini (calabrian chili pomodoro with fresh ricotta) and the Branzino (with PEI mussels, romesco sauce and  preserved lemons). We also ordered Meatballs (orzo parmesan pomodoro) for our daughter. Joseph suggested a side of pasta to go with it and asked what my daughter would like. Daughter ordered pasta with garlic and oil. We also added another side dish: Crispy Brussel Sprouts but omitted the prosciutto that came with it.  After the orders were placed, the bread board finally came out. Then a little while later, the Crab Arancini. Our entrees did not arrive until, I would say, more than half an hour later. I understand the restaurant was busy but I think they should have expected that especially on a Friday night. We also asked for more bread but by the time it came, we didn't need it anymore.  The food was top-notch quality, but lacked flavor. The Spaghetti I ordered was bland. Same goes for the shrimp that was in it. The Crab Arancini was okay - I really couldn't tell if there was crab in it because I did not taste any. Daughter liked the Meatballs and husband said the Bucatini was very good.  Overall, it was a good dining experience. I don't know if I would go back though. I thought it was a bit too pricey and service was slow. I love Giada and she's one of my favorite chefs but was disappointed. The food she cooks on her shows looks (and probably tastes) so much better compared to what we had at her restaurant.",

After awhile we figured it out but ordered to much food.  The detractors for us were loud music constantly beating.  The drunk women at the next table that were way to loud and allowed to stay that way.  And finally, strange enough, I didn't like sitting by the window with the view on to the Strip that was a constant distraction with activity of billboard trucks and people.    Like I said at the start, the food was fantastic.  I can not think of an Italian restaurant with a better execution of fine Italian food.  I will return but I will be careful to ask for quieter seating away from the windows.",

The antipasti tasting board was really good, the cheese, honey, and ratatouille really stuck out for me. The gnocchi is also amazing, really simple but very delicious. The meatballs were without a doubt the best. Unfortunately I don't eat pork or shellfish, and many of the items have pork, so I didn't get the chance to taste everything I wanted, but I still enjoyed what I ordered. I would recommend and come back when I'm in Vegas again.",

My husband said it tastes like the salmon  I make. He didnt love his lemon spaghetti. The pasta tasted homemade but not as lemony as I would expect. It was worth trying for the ambiance but likely will not be back. We made reservations and didnt even get seats with a good view. Also we were celebrating my birthday and after spending $120, they could only afford to give us 2 cookies...oh please! The server was nice and attentive. This place is not worth the price!",

    "text": "We were excited to try this restaurant and made our reservation way in advance.  We had a 7pm reservation and only had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  We wanted the full experience so we ordered the tasting menu ($120ea) and the wine pairing ($70ea) for 4 courses.  While everyone (the waiter, his assistant and the sommalier) were very nice, none of them were in sync with each other.  We received our first wine pairing a good 15 min before the appetizer (a shared antipasto plate), so we didn't really pair them because the drink was finished.  The courses were then spaced far apart and the wine and food were not timed well.  You have a choice for pasta, entree and dessert, but they do not customize the wine to your choice of food and just serve the same to the table (for example, I had salmon and my fiance had steak and we were served the same wine.  It seems that they could have put in a little more effort.) The summary is that we went in at 7 and didn't finish until 9:45 and it cost around $500.  For that, I would say to skip this and go to Michael Mina's at the Bellagio.",

    "text": "I can't even convey how disappointing this was. I don't think I have ever felt so ripped off by a restaurant. I will say the ambiance was excellent and the service was so so. Took about 30 minutes in between courses being served which is unacceptable. They were not even that busy. I will start of with the signature drink the \" Destroyer\" . This is a tequila and orange juice drink with basil. The appealing part was the ice sphere that was supposed to be in it. It  came with regular cubed ice. I asked about the sphere and they said they had run out. It was 5:30pm. Really? Also the basil leaves were thrown in as an afterthought with no muddling whatsoever to infuse the flavor. Could barely taste the tequila and this was $18. Next was the Crostini with lemon and ricotta. Great flavor, but I swear the 4 little toasts were. 1 inch by 1 1/2 inches , that is shameful. Next was the arugula salad with crispy pancetta. Absolutely zero flavor and I counted 6 crum like pancetta pieces that I had to search for in this salad. So sad. I ordered  the $36 lemon and shrimp spaghetti. Could barely taste the lemon, the pasta was stuck together, and seriously even though the shrimp were a nice size, two of them for this price is pathetic. Last and finally, I ordered the lemon bundt cake which was equal to the size of abut 4 bites. Light lemon flavor and pasty texture. This place is ridiculously expensive for the tiny portions and flavorless food I received. There is no way I would ever go back and I only hope the restaurant takes the apparently consistent reviews of tasteless food and small portions seriously. You can't be successful very long without repeat customers.",

It has lots of art and is very inviting. The service was okay but I did need to ask  my waiter (Gary) to refill my water and after my entree came out I asked for a little bit of ground pepper. The man who brought me my food acted like I requested his first born child and questioned my decision. Needless to say because of his reaction I said forget the pepper. I had the spaghetti with lemon and herbs with shrimp. I will say this is some of the best cooked pasta I have ever had. It had very good flavors and with a little crack of black pepper it would have been perfect. The two large shrimp were cooked very well. Overall I would give this place another try to see if my service would be a little better because its in a great location, very inviting and food was pretty good.",

    "text": "Well it has taken me awhile to write this review; I have been waiting for feedback from friends who have since dined at Giada's and wanted to be fair in my review since I am a foodie and tend to hold standards high especially when dining at a celebrity chefs restaurant.....well comments are unanimous....sub par flavors, very small portions for the large price tag.  A review was written by Shahn M 8/3/2014; I was actually the person that had the wine glass broken and spilled on...and no I did not work the manager for a free meal although he did comp our drinks.  While waiting for our table my friend ordered a martini with an onion and was informed by the waitress they didn't have any onion, I'm not a martini drinker but isn't that a common condiment for martinis?  After waiting about an hour ( we had reservations) we finally were seated back in a corner and informed the hostess after waiting so long and having wine spilled on us, the least they could do was seat us at a window table, which they did after another 20 min or so wait.  We ordered a small pizza (best part of the dinner) gnocchi, smashed lemon potatoes, filet ( the size and look of an Omaha steak) And I salad I don't recall.  The food was nothing special and portions very small, but the ending to this dining experience gets better.  We went to the bar to have an after diner drink; 1 shot of tequila and 1 glass of port wine...$38.00 and it wasn't the port!  I've experienced Giada's but can't say I will return or recommend.",

The hostess kept saying we were next but parties kept being seated ahead of us. They were apologetic but no real explanation. Finally the manager walked by and seemed genuinely concerned that we hadn't been seated yet. We were seated quickly after, given a table with a view and a complementary round of cocktails (thus the higher rating!). The food was excellent and delivered quickly, but then we had a hard time getting the bill - maybe why they're so behind on seating?? Basically a great restaurant with a lot of potential, but they need to rethink their flow a bit. Also, more bartenders!  I was able to observe the poor man while I ordered cocktails for our hour wait. Very polite but totally overworked. (The cocktails are excellent by the way :) Order the G or the barberella)",

Fritto Misto was excellent, the eggplant rollatini was surprisingly good since I don't usually care for eggplant, and the meatballs were good though we think they could have used more sauce. Romaine salad was cold and crispy and delicious. I had lobster ravioli and truly this is the best food I have ever tasted. Hubby had veal; it was breaded and properly fried, served with a delicious, cold, chunky tomato sauce on the side, and this was a generous serving of veal. We shared the sweet corn and sausage side dish. The sausage was very spicy but the flavor was still excellent. The trio of tiramisu and plate of cookies, along with an orange and cocoa espresso capped off an extraordinary meal. The service was absolutely first class; our courses were impeccably timed and our glasses were never empty. We had the privilege of meeting Giada herself, which made this a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. This was a pricey evening for us at just over $100 per person (with only 2 drinks) but worth every penny for an extraordinarily unique dining experience.",

Seated promptly, very pleasant and professional hostess staff.  However, that's where the romance ended.  Our waiter was rude, hurried, insulting.  He didn't know the menu ingredients and didn't like it when I made inquires.  Our cocktail order was slow in coming, but very nicely done when they finally arrived.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates - very disappointed.  Sausage was over powering, bacon was lackluster and far too little sauce - couldn't even tell it was gorgonzola.  This dish would have been better with and almond stuffing, Benton bacon (or one with a good deal of \"smoke\") and gorgonzola sauce that could be tasted.  We also ordered Baby Artichokes.  The grill flavor was delicious but the arts could have been trimmed better, too many tough leaves that had to be spit out!  The \"bread\" order and \"condiments\" were delicious.  Next was the crab/scallop risotto.  This was by far the most outstanding dish of the night - definitely one of my top 5 dishes ever ordered from a restaurant.  When I told the waiter how much I like the dish he made some weird comment about Gordon Ramsey???  Our 2 entrees were lobster ravioli and branzino.  The ravioli was fine, but not exceptional.  The branzino was again way under-dressed.  We were so irritated with the service by the end of the meal that we didn't even want to consider dessert or after dinner drinks.  The manager did stop by our table (twice) early in the evening for a cursory \"is everything okay\", but did pause long enough to even get an answer.  The dinner was very expensive and I just don't believe we received the value I had expected with Giada's name attached to it.  Given all of the celebrity chef options in Vegas, I would recommend that my friends make other choices.",

We loved the spaghetti (spa-get-tee), pizettes, chicken cacciatore, and desserts. Can't wait to go back with friends again to try some more.  Only reason I am not giving the 5th star is portion size.  Three were 4 ladies in my group, none trying to eat a heavy meal but we probably ordered 4 apps, 2 pastas and and an entree to share and had plenty of room for 3 desserts. The prices aren't low but not as overpriced as many Vegas Strip restaurants.  Love, love this restaurant.  Built to last!",

    "text": "A friend told me about Giada and as we've seen her several times on Food Network and enjoyed her show and recipies, we decided to give it a try when we were in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend. We were not disappointed with the decor, service, views and most importantly, the food! I read some of the negative service reviews prior to making our reservation, but we didn't see any evidence of that during our very delicious and relaxing lunch at Giada. They promptly took our order, checked on us several times and repeatedly made sure our water glasses and coffee cups were filled. Service was effective and prompt without being uncomfortable or rushed. So sit back and just enjoy this dining experience!   They offer beautiful views of the Vegas strip from most of the tables at Giada and you'll enjoy the warm and airy decor. We started off with the Orzo Meatballs which were very good, but not astounding. I then ordered the Italian Chicken and Waffles for my entree and my husband ordered the Salmon Cake Benedict. It was one of the best Chicken and Waffles I've ever had and I've had many! The chicken was cooked to absolute perfection. It was served warm, flavorful and crispy without being greasy. The cacciatore sauce was as delicious as it was beautiful, savory and oh so right. Now I'm not a big fan of waffles, but the polenta, parmesan waffles were amazing. They were light and savory and the perfect pairing with the fried chicken and cacciatore sauce. Do yourself a favor and order this dish! We ate at several fine establishments in Las Vegas, but this entree stands on its own. Wow, I was so impressed with the flavors and preparation that made this dish so unbelievably delicious! I wish we had this restaurant in SF!",

We were immediately greeted by 2 young uniform (not cute uniform- clad) hostesses and taken to our table where we were pleasantly greeted by a lovely polite appropriate waitress. We got our coffee immediately. Here is why I couldn't give this 5 stars. The coffee was lukewarm. I decided since I had already told the waitress one of our water glasses had water spots around the rim that I wouldn't mention the coffee. Other than that my husband and I both really enjoyed our unusual breakfast choices. His eggs were cooked as requested with a side of meatballs, potatoes, and toast. He was very happy. Not being an egg person I opted for chicken and waffles. It was a large portion and unusual for breakfast, but very good and nice to have something unusual. Great service, great place. It sort of looked like a West Elm store on steroids. Very cool. Great art. Almost too much but fun!",

    "text": "On August 18th, I had the immense pleasure of dining at Food Network star Giada De Laurentiis's restaurant - Giada. Now, if you know me then you will know that I am a huge Giada fan. She is the chef I receive the most inspiration from for my cooking and it is her cookbooks that I turn to first when looking for guidance or a new recipe to try. I have even had the honor of meeting her at a book signing once - yes, she is that beautiful and yes, she is incredibly kind.  This love of Giada is shared by my amazing mother, Janet. We love to watch her shows on Food Network, make her recipes together, and most importantly - eat her recipes together! After Giada opened her Las Vegas restaurant at the Cromwell in the summer of 2014, my mom always said that if she could dine anywhere, she would love to try Giada Vegas.  August 18th is my mother's birthday, and this year her birthday was one of special significance for a multitude of reasons. I wanted to do something out of the ordinary to celebrate her on this important birthday, so I surprised her with a trip to Las Vegas, a stay at Caesar's Palace, and dinner reservations at Giada. I didn't tell her where we were dining until right before dinner, and I loved seeing her face light up when I told her that we were going to finally try her top dining destination. Her birthday dinner could not have been better as our dining experience was one of the best either of us has ever had. Giada is a True treasure of restaurant.   To summarize, dining at Giada in Las Vegas was a fantastic experience that I will always remember. It was the perfect place to celebrate my mom on this birthday of importance. The warm and inviting atmosphere, the unrivaled service, and the heavenly dishes made our time at Giada a smile-invoking and memorable experience. \"Experience\" - this is an important word here because that is what Giada Vegas provides; it's more than a nice a meal and a view, it is full dining event that is as pleasing to the eyes, ears, and spirit as it is to the tongue and the stomach.  I recommend Giada to anyone in Las Vegas that is looking for spectacular food and a wonderful time. Thank you to Giada and staff for such a treat of an evening!

    "text": "I had an unfortunate experience at Giada this past Saturday. My friends and I were looking forward to having a great meal before seeing Mariah Carey in concert. We arrived for our 6pm reservation and were told that the restaurant was running behind and had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated. No problem, we were okay with that. We let the hostess know we had a time constraint and she said she would alert our server. Once we were finally seated we sat for over 10 minutes with NO menus! My sister flagged down a waiter and he politely came over and gave menus and told us our waiter would be with us shortly.   Fast forward 15 minutes, no service. We were appalled, our waiter NEVER stopped by our table... any service we received we had to stop someone walking by and request. Now, I don't want to start throwing around accusations but we were the only people of color in the entire restaurant and we weren't served. I'll leave it at that. When the hour was nearing 7pm my friends and I got up and walked out,,,,,  still hungry and very disappointed. Our assigned waiter just stared as we walked by. We made a complaint to the manager onsite and I later received an apology via email from another manager, I do appreciate them reaching out and apologizing however, after how we were treated on Saturday I'm not sure if I'll make the effort to try again the next time I am in Vegas which is a shame, the food looked good too!",

Giada actually  showed up and walked around and greeted people!! She was incredibly nice and tiny.  As for the the food, the first time around was great and the second time was just ok which is why I've landed on a four. I've tired the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, the veal, tricolore salad, and margharita pizza. The pasta was fantastic! I should have gotten it again. The salad and pasta were the second visit and they left much to be desired. The salad had too many flavors happening and way too much cheese (and I love cheese so that says a lot). The pizza was just boring - not bad but just not exciting or worth the money. The veal I can't remember because I had one bite but I remember my fiancee finishing it so it must have been good enough.   The ambiance elevates the property...Cromwell isn't that impressive without this restaurant.",

We saw him in the beginning and the end. While he passed by several times couldn't find the time to see how things were. Tea glass sat empty for 10 minutes then almost 8 minutes to get a refill. That is not attentive service. Would recommend but keep an eye on your server for service.   What I find most interesting is that there is no indication that Management feels to respond to negative comments or issues. In all my dining experiences where I have had issues or left negative feedback I usually get a response or comment from Management. This lack of response just shows that they are not concerned with people's (customers) issues.",

Make reservations to ensure you get in. I am almost certain you won't get a seat unless you book agreed.   We got:   the Orange sticky bun: $4. Huge! Sticky, really orange-y flavor. Perfect start to a breakfast   Cornbread bacon muffin: $4. Kind of small. Crumbly and dry. Wouldn't over again.   Mortadella sandwich: $16 ish. My husband loved this. Tons of meat and a little side of fried zucchini.   Polenta waffle with bacon and fried egg: $16 ish. The waffle was super light, great flavor and the fried eggs were perfect. I would have liked a little more bacon, but would order again.   Overall, a little overpriced but worth the experience. Would go again.",

Four stars for the hostess - even though it was empty around 5 pm, she didn't give us out of towners a better seat by the window and we were seated right next to another couple very far from the window and I was bummed. Five stars for the food - my lobster ravioli was delicious. Four stars because what we ordered off the iPad regarding Giada's favorites, was missing one of the ingredients that was advertised (bell peppers) and replaced with giardiniera.   For the price you pay to dine here, I was not so impressed. I would definitely go back because of the friendly service, but I would probably just stick to a pasta dish, a drink and dessert.",

    "text": "I am a bit torn between 2 and 3 stars as Giada was ok, but we have definitely had much better and even better pricing at other restaurants of the same caliber.  We went for my wife's birthday, arrived about 5 minutes early but were seated 15 minutes after our reservations which we were totally ok with it as they gave us a window seat with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  We typically eat several small meals throughout the day and thus if we go out share several plates versus ordering individually. Surprisingly our 4 courses came out to the sound of $168 and we left hungry due to their small portion sizes. We expected the higher price point, but it would have been more acceptable if we left satisfied.  We ordered: Giada's Caprese - perfect combination of heirloom cherry tomatoes and mozzarella! Mortadella - savory on top of moist bread, even better with a little pesto from the bread tray! Surf & Turf - crab raviolo (1) was good ... filet was questionable, arrived with a greyish color...in the moment I thought it may be the lighting, but the flavor said differently. It was still tender but was not worth the $60 price tag. Sweet Corn - sweet and savory, just a hint of spice...delicious! Chocolate Tart - definitely worth going just for this...decadent!  Service was great! Diego was our server and he was on top of it. Although it took a bit for him to warm up to us, I would still recommend asking for his section. The staff went out of their way to wish a happy birthday to my wife and even surprised her with a note on our desert plate!  Overall great service, not so great food and overpriced.",

    "text": "Every bite I took her was eyes-rolled-to-the-back-of-my-head delicious. I'm not going to lie, it was fantastic. The only thing that deters me from this place is the ridiculous over pricing and smaller portions.   The waiter introduced us to Giada's style as an emphasis on feeling like family and \"eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.\"   I would describe this place as tapas style if anything, there a lot of small plates to choose from, but they are in fact really small bites. So if you're starving I suggest getting a few antipastas and to share for the table before moving onto the main dishes. The pastas are served in 5 oz servings, if that gives you an idea.   As for ambiance, this place is super classy. My friend wore flip flops and felt self-conscious the entire time...until the guy next to us sat down in shorts and flip flops too. The decor is homey, but classy - it makes you forget where you are until you look out at the giant view of the strip. There's also a fun photobooth to print or email pictures for free while you wait for your table!   Back to the main thing though - the food!  We ordered a few things. We got the burrata and grilled artichoke antipastas to share. The burrata was fresh and mild and delicious and everything burrata should be. Albeit, it was difficult to slice in any graceful manner. The grilled artichokes were the mini hearts grilled to perfection, hints of lemon and herbs perfectly complimenting it.   I ordered the chicken marsala meatballs as my main dish because I was actually still full from the brunch buffet we had that morning. 5 delicious meatballs and 2 cherry tomatoes came to my table looking a little underwhelming, but they were packed with flavor.   My vegetarian friend ordered the eggplant antipasta which was also delicious. The eggplant wasn't overcooked at all and the marinara sauce wasn't overpowering.   My other friend ordered the lamb parppadelle and it was amazing. The tomato based sauce brought out the lamb flavors in just the right, delicate way.   I was reading through the reviews of this place and I started to think I was there on a good day because my food tasted delicious! That being said though, not sure if it's worth the prices really.   Bottom line:  Did I enjoy dinner? Absolutely!  Would I ever go back? Maaaybe. It's really pricey for what it is, so only if I actually hit the jackpot for once.",

It was still an elegant table, although a bit tight with the neighboring tables once they were filled.   Bread board came with several dips (sea salt, olive oil, butter, pepper, and a couple others flavors. The freshly baked focaccia bread (served right in the pot) and cheese crisp bread were standouts and a very unique touch.   Minestrone soup was good, nice flavors, but, I would recommend trying a salad as there just  wasn't enough soup in the bowl for me. It was also on the lukewarm side.   Main course;  I ordered the Lemon Spaghetti and Shrimp.  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly, the lemon flavored sauce bended well with the shrimp.  Wife ordered the Char Broiled Filet Mignon which was also perfectly cooked.   We added the Roasted Cauliflower accompaniment, which to our surprise contained at least four different varieties of cauliflower, flavored subtly, but, very tasty.  Overall I would rate this one of the better restaurants in LV.   We were happy with the food, ambiance, and even the price!",

We did not go here trying to Be cheap, however just didn't want to Be completely full before our last night of drinking in Vegas, so the eye roll was very unappreciated. Also, our waiter never came back to check on if we were satisfied with our Meals or Needed anything else- we were also never asked if we wanted pepper, which was a bummer because the place is known For Having seriously massive pepper grinders. A tip to the servers would be to treat every individual coming into spend money there as they are important. Not just the ones who order a bunch of food so You know Your tip will Be high. I decided to go eat there due to being a food network lover, and my choice solidified when I read the yelp reviews stating wait staff was so kind- sad I didn't have the same service experience. Aside from that, food was phenomenal so I will go back if I find myself in Vegas again.",

    "text": "I adore Giada -- she basically taught me how to make and enjoy Italian food, and when I found out she was opening a restaurant in Vegas, I knew I had to go.   The restaurant is so beautiful. It is elegant, simple, but with very distinct decor and lighting fixtures. Clearly, every detail was thoroughly planned with a creative eye, from the tiles to the placemats. Even the stemware had a feminine touch.   We were greeted by some very lovely hostesses--they looked amazing in their matching short sleeved white eyelit dresses. (I want that dress!!!) We were seated by the window, which gave us a view of the Bellagio fountains.   Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the quality of the wait staff. We sat without menus or acknowledgement for 5 minutes, we were promised water but didn't receive any for another 10 minutes, and then we were promised bread, which also didn't arrive for another 5 minutes. Our waiter also got parts of our orders wrong--my friend received the wrong side, and I received a red sangria instead of a white sangria. He was polite and did acknowledge the long wait time for basic service and corrected my friend's order quickly. When our appetizers arrived, the plates were just thrusted randomly on the table by the food runners, which I felt seemed tacky.  Another surprising thing was how dirty some of the utensils were. There were bits of food on both my fork and knife, and the spoon for one of our appetizers had dishwasher stains all over it. Not harmful in anyway, but just very surprising for what I thought the basic standards of an upscale restaurant would be.  Despite receiving the red sangria instead of the white, I ended up being thrilled about the waiter's mistake. This drink was so very refreshing and tasty--it was everything I would expect a Giadian drink to be: light, fizzy, fruity, and elegant!   We started our meal with a couple of appetizers: chicken marsala meatballs and a plate of gorgonzola cheese. The meatballs were tender and juicy, but lacked flavor; however, the mushrooms, sauce, and blistered tomatoes were delicious. The gorgonzola came with raw honey and pear slices, and each bite was decadent and dreamy.  For my lunch, I ordered G's baked pasta of the day, which came with a side salad of arugula and generous parmesan (ahem, I mean parm-i-gi-a-no re-ggi-a-no) shavings. The pasta was a lasagna loaded with hearty vegetables, tons of ooey gooey cheese, and topped with a parm crust! How does that not scream Giada? The salad was light and refreshing with a lemony dressing, and the parm shavings on top were the perfect salty bite.  I couldn't leave without trying dessert--Giada has quite the sweet tooth, right? I was torn between the zeppole and the strawberry tomato crostada, but ended up choosing the crostada because of how unique it sounded. Wow, it was EVERYTHING. The crust was buttery and crisp, enveloping a tart and sweet red filling with fresh strawberry slices on top. I wanted more!   This is definitely somewhere I NEED to return to--I am going to make a reservation for dinner and THEN find a flight to Vegas!!",

I had a good time in the photo booth and also enjoyed my cucumber martini. However, the Branzino that was supposed to be \"Mediterranean Seabass\" tasted like pond trout or something that was caught in the Bellagio fountain. The potato cake served with my filet was cold. My 7 oz filet was very good. I'll give them that. But I was very unimpressed with the food especially considering the price. Nice gay waiter. Service was great. I just wish they would have served better food.",

    "text": "And the hate keeps on coming!  I just reviewed Carnevino and saw the bs negative attitude. It's pricey and pretentious they say.  Yes and yes. But still delicious and worth it if you can afford it. Giada is no different.    There are simply some restaurants in Vegas that are in different categories of price levels and we need to understand that. You take a restaurant like Giada, which is quite expensive but easily accessible to anyone who wants to get in. Compare that to Robuchon which is uber expensive and impossible to walk in without a reservation months in advance. Yet there isnt a single person reviewing Robuchon and saying oh wow it was pricey even though its 500 a person. There's a reason for that and it's that the kinds of people who take the time to go to Robuchon have never thought price points were a relevant criticism. And if the food is good enough, as it is at Giada, neither do I.   The menu items have in some ways changed a lot since I was there as a few things I ordered are no longer on the menu but I will address them anyways.  -Mussels. Not the same as they are on the menu now but very delicious and cooked perfectly. Very natural flavors.  -Prosciutto crostini. Not on the menu anymore and the weakest part of the meal. Pesto a little bland but the prosciutto made up for it  -Pea Soup. Also not on the menu but OMG this was amazing and the best part of the meal. It's similar to the butternut squash puree on the menu now. Had a lot of ingredients including crispy prosciutto but it was a mind blowing cold soup.  -Bucatini. Awesome. A truly fresh and light pomodoro pasta.  -Pappardelle. Oh god it was so good. The pork ragout was nuts.  -Surf & Turf. This was honestly a bit of a shocker because I wasnt expecting a filet to be top tier at an Italian restaurant but it really was. A great filet and the surf, I think it was lobster then but now it's shrimp, was delicious and buttery.  There's just no defense of a 3.5 average review of this place. Complaining that the pasta side dish is 30 dollars just doesn't cut it for me. I get for some that's a deal breaker and ultimately that is the problem. The pasta section doesnt say side dish or appetizer it just says pasta. I can see plenty of orangoutangs getting drunk in the casino, walking in, ordering a 30 dollar pasta dish and getting drunk angry when they realize it's a side dish meant for sharing. Maybe the waiting staff could do a better job conveying this to its customers or you could just recognize that there's a reason why there's 'mains' section and a 'pasta' section. The implication being that the PASTAS ARE NOT MAINS.  It is so good. Don't listen to the haters and just go. Don't let your wallet ruin a perfectly wonderful dining experience.",

    "text": "We booked this meal for a special occasion, and filled out a form with credit card information to ensure a window/fountain view seat. Everything, and I mean everything, was fabulous!  We waited a few minutes to be seated for our reservation, which was fine. We took a few shots in the photobooth, conveniently located in the waiting area. When we were seated, the hostess congratulated us on our special occasion, which was a nice touch. Our seats were SPECTACULAR. We had the of the 3 best tables, with a water view. Due to the time that we arrived, we were able to see the strip in daylight, twilight, sunset, and night.   Our server, Laura (maybe Lauren?) was spot-on. She made great recommendations but wasn't pushy at all. She explained the way that service work-- meant to be on the slow, luxurious side.   We ordered to our heart's content: the burrata (divine, soft, and pillowy) and were given some complimentary breads (bread sticks and Parmesan crisps which were amazing, accompanied by a luscious lemon spread and basil spread). Then we had the marsala chicken meatballs (excellent) and honey-salt fresh ricotta bruchetta (uh-may-zing) to round out the appetizers. We each had a soup,m the ciopinno and yellow tomato (both exquisite). We followed that with the spaghetti with lemon and prawn, and risotto (the best I've ever had, with perfectly seared scallops). We had a teensy bit of room for the surf & turf and saltimbocca entrees that we had ordered. We ended up taking them home and eating them the next day as a meal! We got coffee and tea, and the server brought us an adorable 'congratulations' plate with 2 cookies; lemon, and fudgey chocolate.   I'm not sure why this place doesn't have an overwhelming 5-star rating--it was easily the best meal of our lives. Each dish is prepared with such attention to detail that it's palpable. The food itself is enough to rank this as a top spot, and the service knocks it out of the park. Never once was my water glass empty--it was always refilled quicker than I could mention. All of the service staff is excellent, and it's a joy to eat at such a fine establishment. While a meal might set you back a pretty penny or two, it's worth the investment for a real quality establishment.  Fun fact: Look for the \"G\"s on everything. Seriously, she loves her name. That letter is on ev-er-ay-thang.",

The ambience is nice, upscale, clean, pretty. The waiters jackets are all ill fitting which goes along with the hostesses skin tight dresses.   The wine selection is great and prices are fair.   The food sounds amazing but is subpar at best. I think that Olive Garden and carrabas deliver an equally quality meal for 1/3 the price. We ordered the lemon crab and fried artichoke appetizers. Crab was delicious but the artichoke was a disaster. Turned out to be a lot of hummus inside an inedible artichoke with the same cheese crackers they give for free which absolutely do not pair well with hummus.  The salad was a disgrace. Arugula with pancetta and candied lemon. There was a total of 7 tiny pieces of pancetta and no lemon. Basically arugula with a hint of Parmesan  Pasta was ok. The bucatini was spicy but bland. The tortellini was ok but undercooked.   Definitely not worth the money it costs. Save your cash or go elsewhere. Unless you have low expectations......",

    "text": "I rarely give 5-stars, and Giada's at The Cromwell is fully deserving of all of them. Service was impeccable, the decor is upscale, yet understated, the food was incredibly flavorful, and the wine an excellent complement to my meal. I dined there with a friend on Friday, May 13.   We waited a few minutes to be seated for our 5:45pm reservation (made via Open Table), and were gratified to receive a table for two with a strip view. We weren't right next to the windows, but rather directly across. The tables were staggered, however, so we could clearly see out the window without having to look directly at our fellow diners.  The most delicious bread items were brought to our table almost immediately, as was still water from a bottle.  We decided to order the tasting menu and were extremely pleased with our choice. I chose the pea pesto tortellini and the tenderloin. My friend had the spaghetti with shrimp and the salmon. We shared the antipasti, lemon potatoes, and corn/sausage. While we chose different pasta and main courses, the flavors of both of our choices blended impeccably with the shared dishes. Giada truly understands flavors and how to complement them to please the palate. I prefer my meat cooked to medium-well temperature, and sometimes that means that the meat may not be as soft as it would be at a lower temperature. However, the beef tenderloin cut like soft butter even though it was only slightly pink and NOT butterflied. This speaks to the cut/quality of the beef and the skill of the chef.  I ordered the Il Boro Super Tuscan wine and it paired beautifully with my meal.  After we had finished our food, we were presented within 5 minutes or so with the dessert cart, from which we could chose three selections. I chose the lemon cheesecake, a slice of raspberry mascarpone tart, and the raspberry tiramisu. Holy moley!!! All three selections were of a decent size and delicious.  For around $175 with tip (each), I was completely pleased and wouldn't have changed a thing. I will note that I do not regularly spend that amount of money on dinner. My usual choices are more in the $50 range. However, with it being Las Vegas, a name chef, the location, the decor, the impeccable flavors in the food, the very complementary wine, and the excellent, unobtrusive, friendly service, I didn't blink an eye at the bill. FIVE STARS!",

A little cheesy to be honest. My mom and I came early for our reservation so we sat at the bar. Instead of giving us an actual menu they handed us an Ipad with the cocktail list on it. A little weird but I get it, trying to be up to date and whatnot I guess.   Once we were seated, our waiter came up to us and presented the menu and then also presented a set tasting menu that was I belive $120 BUT you also get a signed photo of Giada. What? This seemed strange to me and again, a little cheesy. She really seems a bit full of herself to be honest. We opt to not do this because honestly, we really didnt care about a signed photo of Giada.   The menu is huge and to be honest a little confusing. My mom and I decide to get a pasta dish and then an entree to share. Our waiter recommended the ravioli with lobster, green asparagus tips, and tarragon as a pasta dish and then the Veal Chop Saltimbocca so thats what we went with. The ravioli was really good but the veal chop was meh. It was a little over salted and we didnt finish it. Overall, if you are visiting this restaurant I would go with a pasta dish. The pasta tasted fresh and was delicious but our entree not so much.",

    "text": "When my family and I were hungry we decided to go to Giada to eat. My mom watches FoodNetwork all the time for cooking inspiration and her favorite \"food celebrity\" is Giada. We all were happy to see her restaurant and wanted to know if this place was worthy of coming back to or not.  When we came to the front desk, a hostess told us that we were able to be seated anywhere we wanted as long as it was in the lounge area of the restaurant. It was really busy and all the four person tables were taken so we settled for a seating that was meant for two people. Keep in mind that my family consisted of four people. This was the time when I started getting my hopes down.  Luckily, soon enough, a waitress noticed us sitting in the cramped lounge and brought us to an actual table instead. I was so thankful! Our spot was away from the windows that overlooked the strip so I was a little bit disappointed. Little did I know that I would soon forget all about the view...  Our waitress was extremely nice and her enthusiasm didn't sound forced at all like some other waitresses. We started off with an appetizer that consisted of:  Mussels Chicken Marsala Meatballs Arugula salad The appetizers were very tasty but my favorite out of all of them would have to be the Arugula salad. There were a good variety of greens and the dish came with a very thin slice of cheese (I can't remember what type of cheese it was). I sort of wish that there was more cheese. The dressing was on point too!  For our main course, we ordered: Whole Roasted Chicken For Two Charred Asparagus  Sweet Corn The chicken was meant for two but since my family was the type who can't eat a whole plate of something without getting full, we just ordered one of those. When the chicken came in there were about four hearty pieces of chicken and this type of soup or sauce that included veggies. It was the perfect amount for us! The asparagus and the corn were side dishes and complimented the chicken nicely.  By the time dessert came around, everyone was pretty full so we all shared a Souffle. It came with a delicious scoop lemon ice cream that the waitress scooped in the souffle before our eyes. Powdered sugar was also sprinkled on top of everything. It tasted amazing!  Overall, the service was great (besides the hostess)! Everyone was really nice and gave off a \"comforting aura.\" The food was fantastic and you can taste the quality in the dishes! I would most definitely come back when I have the chance.",

Giadas offers a pre fix menu for $125 dollars which includes a few receipts and an autographed picture of her and unlimited desserts.  We ordered the lobster ravioli which was very good. The sauce on it was just delicious! The best part was the garlic bread which was soft and freshly baked. The desert is displayed on a cart and you can pick as many options as you want. The best ones were the lime cookies (I know they are only cookies but they are truly one of the best I have ever eaten). The tiramisu raspberry was very good and the cheese cake is pretty decent as well.  Unfortunately, the service was not as good. I was truly expecting exceptional service coming from a well recognized chef. Overall, the food was decent but nothing unforgettable about it!",

For a party of 4, we did order A LOT, yet we were somewhat satisfied with only 2-3 items, the rest weren't good. Food was just bland in general, nothing special.   Haven't been back since then...",

For our first night in Las Vegas, we decided on a fancy date night GIADA! As we walked in, we were met with an elegant and simplistic decor as well as the place settings. While we waited for our awesome server, we took in the view of the strip as the sun set down. Our server came with the various menus that were available for the night. After giving us a few minutes, he came back to suggest vegetarian options, which matched what my husband and I wanted to try. Normally, we share an appetizer and a main course but our server told us that the portions are on the smaller side so we could sample more dishes.   Our Meal  Bread Plate (we LOVED the Garlic Rosemary bread baked in the cast iron bowl) Cipollini Onions Rigatoni with Vegetable Bolognese Swiss Chard Rolls Lemon Potatoes Chocolate Tart (which had 24k Gold shavings!)   Our server was friendly and jovial making our meal a very pleasant one. The atmosphere was perfect for a date night (casual or fancy). The portions are also ideal so one can try multiple dishes. All items were cooked to perfection, with each of the ingredients standing on its own without overpowering the others. We definitely plan on coming back for another meal the next time we are in town. Can't wait to try more of Giada's specialties.",

We were happy to also find that the decor was light, bright, and comfortable with an easy ambiance, no stuffy feeling here at all. The staff was super friendly and the GM even stopped by and chatted with us about the restaurant and the food. I have always had great success with any of Giada's recipes that I have tried to reproduce so I am happy to report that the food here was just as great as I expected and I look forward to returning soon.",

We started with her amazing crab and artichoke dip.  I could smell the crab meat as soon as they set it down.  That's a rare thing.  Usually you have to search for the crab meat.  It was a generous portion and delicious.  The Bread board provided was wonderful and had a good variety to choose from.  (My husband loved the bread knife).  Our server was so sweet and very helpful with our choices.  She advised us that the pasta portions were small.  However, we weren't that hungry so my husband ordered the lemon spaghetti and shrimp and I had the lobster ravioli. Well let me tell you, there was plenty there!  And it was wonderful.  We never felt rushed and our time there was quiet and peaceful.  Which is not a Las Vegas trait.  I can't tell you enough how much we enjoyed out time there.  My only disappointment is that Giada was not in house that evening.  Make time in your schedule to go to Giada but make sure you call and make reservations.  You won't be disappointed.",

What a horrible way to start the night! I had a barbarella and a frose; fun drinks and an interesting cocktail menu with plenty of variety. Bread presentation was quite nice but it all went downhill from there. Tried the bacon wrapped dates; had a little kick but the date and bacon ratio wasn't quite right and it was kind of cold- would skip that. Corn and sausage side was not worth ordering either. Ordered the lemon spaghetti with shrimp which I guess wasn't the worst but over the top sour taste and started to get gross. Also ordered the risotto, scallops were great and the flavors were boring. Would've liked to been offered some pepper with their red large pepper grinder just for the experience but the waiter never bothered, I think he hated his job too. For dessert lemon souffle was amazing, the tiramisu cheesecake had beautiful presentation but not that tasty. They never replaced our plates for new courses or did much as far as customer service- basically don't expect much. Over priced for the lack of attention to service and less than average food/menu and to top it all off, hostesses talk amongst themselves and watch you leave without saying a thing.",

The setting is absolutely amazing inside the Cromwell Hotel. It's located on the Vegas Strip and features a five star interior. Giada's philosophy of \"Eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything\" is ideal for this dining experience. We usually eat family style and have a lot of favorites. The appetizers that we love are the flatbread, orzo meatballs and the Parmigiano-Reggiano with wild sage honey. All of our entrees were delicious. The artichoke side dish was amazing. And the deserts are to die for. Our waiter, Joseph Rodriguez, gave us excellent recommendations and was absolutely amazing. He has a commanding knowledge of the entire menu.

Last September I made a reservation on Open Table and requested a window seat \"if possible\".  I received a phone call telling me that to guarantee a window seat my husband and I had to sign a contract guaranteeing that we would spend $100 each.  And we signed..so shame on us.  That night I kept saying \"order this....get that\" making sure we made our $200 minimum.  I don't know if they have continued this practice, but it's wrong.  The restaurant is beautiful but the view is not special....yes you can see the fountains but they are across the busy strip. But I found myself in Vegas last week and we made a reservation for Friday evening, but did NOT make any special request.  And where were we seated? Table for two at the window! But we sat.....and sat.....and sat....no water was poured, no menu to look at..no drink order taken.  When we finally got some attention, the specials were pushed....we ordered chicken Marsala meatballs, bacon wrapped dates, tortellini in lemon pesto sauce, and risotto.  Appetisers came first, then the bread and cocktails....everything was \"off\".  Food was good, portions small for the $.  No complimentary cookies, no dessert cart.  I like Giada and used to like the restaurant but had an amazing experience earlier in the week at Carbone so no need to return unless the restaurant returns to the way it was when it first opened.",

The service that I had was very good, and they were knowledgeable of the entree's.  I had the rack of lamb, and it was soooooo amazing.  They were prepared perfectly as the meat just melted in my mouth.  With the lamb, I had the Arugula candied lemon salad, which I saw on her show.  Once I saw that on the menu, I had to order it, and it was tasty. The candied lemon dressing was light, and flavorful and not overpowering.  Now to the wine.  I had a malbec and it was very delicious, and it went very well with the lamb.  If you are in the mood for a very classy place with some AWESOME Italian, you have to try Giada's.

Smaller portions were quite obviously being upsold by the waiter when presenting the menu.  I've never heard a waiter saying the appetizers are designed small so they are recommended at 1 1/2 per person.  The entrees were well prepared, well presented, and delicious, but once again on the smaller side (6 average size lobster ravioli for $37).  The view of the Las Vegas strip at sunset is exactly as advertised.  The service was excellent and attentive.   Our entire party appreciated the hosts turning away the drunks coming over from Drai's day club and improperly attired.  In a town where fine dining can be found in a myriad of places, I doubt I'll come back here due strictly due to the value issue. I know some folks reading this may think I'm cheap, but I have no problem paying top dollar in a restaurant truly deserving of justifying high prices.",

We ordered the pizza carbonara, and two salads that were drowning in dressing.  The entrees were terrible.  Three of us left hungry and all for the small price of 187.85....  the best part of the meal was the window view over the intersection of flamingo and Las Vegas blvd.  where you can see the Bellagio fountain from a distance but the noise from the traffic makes it somewhat undesirable especially if you would like to talk to each other.

Ask for a table by the window to get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. There are only a few tables with a view. Enjoy",

Food was plentiful even though our server suggested we may want to consider adding a size to our entree.  So glad we didn't.   We started off with a bread plate of course.  For appetizers we ordered the mushrooms and the imported Burrata cheese plate. The basalmic salt.....so delish! Then he had the pea soup while I had the romaine salad. Entrees consisted of the surf & turf....so even though you only get 1 crab filled ravioli with your tenderloin steak, trust me, it's plenty! & the veal chop. Again portions plentiful. Unfortunately there was no more room in the belly for desert.  Really enjoyed the experience  & worth every pretty penny!",

Our service was very good, Ron was attentive and very sweet   Ready to answer any questions as well as helping guide through some of my decisions.  The food.. the bread and sides delicious. Our appetizers : chicken Marsala meatball and eggplant both very good. Actually the tomatoes in my salad and the cheese on my caprese salad were truly amazing. While I opted for the tortellini my husband had the bronzini both very good. Dessert we opted for her cookies think we overdid it because I wasn't a fan of the chocolate chip cookie   While I would recommend this restaurant and I'm glad we came I don't know if I would choose to come back",

First off, the atmosphere is loud.  Giada's located on the strip and there's loud music pumping in the restaurant as well as Las Vegas strip traffic coming from the outside.  The decor is contemporary.  We ordered the lobster arancini, charred octopus, arugula salad, chicken Marsala metballs, tortellini, and branzino.  The complimentary bread was a miss.  The olive oil bread was super oily and the breadsticks tasted stale.  The charred octopus is a miss.  It tasted like bad seafood from Chinatown.  The flavor was definitely off.  The lobster arancini was disappointing and I couldn't taste any lobster.  The chicken Marsala meatballs were try.  The tortellini had a good flavor profile but was super dry.  The only hits were the arugula salad and the branzino.  For dessert, we ordered lemon bundt cake.  I've never had such a dry mealy cake.  The service was definitely great, but I won't be back because it wasn't worth the price.  Perhaps those we rated Giada's higher had a better experience.",

My wife had the Pasta Fagioli soup, while I opted for the Tricolore Gorgonzola salad. Both were absolutely wonderful.  We shared a small antipaste, which included tuna crostini with pickle, bacon wrapped dates, and grilled sweet baby peppers stuffed with goat cheese...delightful!  My entree was Rigatoni with a tasty vegetable bolognese...its flavor profile was surprisingly intense (in a very good way). My wife's Salmon filet was perfectly cooked, and our side of sweet corn with sausage had a nice kick to it that would have made Bobby Flay proud.  We were too full to consider desert...maybe next time.  Only a couple of nits to pick...the antipasti/drink menu was on an ipad, which was entirely unnecessary...stick to traditional menus unless you enjoy watching those over 50 fumble around with them. One of our paper menus had a grease spot that prominently marred the entree selections...no excuse for that. One of our chairs wobbled badly...I had to reach for another to replace it...this sort of thing has no place in an upscale venue.  We will return in a few months, and leave room for desert.",

The bar tender seemed to have better things to do than serve us. By the time we got our glass of wine our table was ready. We started with the bacon wrapped dates and roasted eggplant. The dates were sickly sweet. We couldn't finish them. The eggplant was delicious and the highlight of our entire meal. For entrees we had the signature dish \"spaghetti\" and the veal chop. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente but incredibly dry and the shrimp was over cooked.  The veal chop was nothing more than a large, breaded, fried piece of veal. Nothing like what we expected for $54. There are way better Italian restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "I hate that I am writing this 2 star review.  I have followed Giada for years - watched her shows, bought her books, went to book signings.  I was so excited to try her restaurant, but was not impressed.    We sat at the bar by choice - there were open tables, but we knew we just wanted a cocktail and small bites, so grabbed some bar seats.   We were noticed right away and given menus and the tablet to review.  We started with signature cocktails the Riso Amaro and Le Notti - these were fantastic.  Went downhill from there - we ordered the Sausage Arancini and drunken goat cheese.  We received the drunken goat cheese first and noticed it was frankly just cheese with nothing to eat it with.  At that point the bartender did bring us the bread plate - the crackers were good, but the cheese was frankly just cheese -nothing exciting.    The Arancini arrived next and I cut one in half - didn't see any sausage, but took a bite.  Was surprised to have a crab taste - my husband then tried and he agreed - they were the wrong ones.   We flagged down the bartender and asked her what she thought - she kinda shrugged and brought over the other bartender who agreed - those couldn't be right they aren't the correct color. They double checked the order (yes, we did order sausage and not crab)   He took away the plate and went to the kitchen.  he returned saying \"those were wrong they will get you the correct ones\"    There wasn't an apology or anything - we felt like we were the ones who made the mistake. the order finally came out and we ate them - just ok - definitely better than the crab ones, but not impressed.   It might have also been the service that just left a bad taste in our mouths.   A bill just showed up in front of us - not asking if we wanted dessert or anything.   We paid and left - When we walked by the hostess desk there were 3 employees standing there putting on lipstick and chatting - there was no \" thanks for coming - join us again\"     well we won't be joining again - work on the service and tighten up the kitchen - just an expensive tip from me to you.",

Food presentation was rushed and sloppy (we have ordered the same thing on multiple visits over the last year and know what it should look like...) Server never brought over the drink menu and it took forever to get drinks or wine at the table. Food came out lukewarm and the spaghetti, which was my favorite meal, was too salty and looked gray. The vibe seemed rushed and un-friendly. They boxed up my leftovers and forgot to bring them out, then \"found them\" somewhere in the back and have them to me in a ripped bag?? Sketch. Hopefully it was an off-night, but I felt much more like a customer in the way than a guest who was dropping lots of $$$ for the experience. Better places on the strip, sad for me to say!",

We had an amazing experience since Giada herself showed up and said hello \"amazing\" and the food was pretty darn good too. Unfortunately that's not how the evening began, after reading previous reviews we decided to arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation time and we still had to wait more than 30 minutes to be seated. Our server stopped by with a tablet and said something about cocktails then left, he came back 10 minutes later and offered us water and a menu and took our drink orders which we received 5 minutes later and he brought our bread and dips (we had to figure out the dips since the waiter didn't explain anything) then he took our appetizer order, we received that about 15 minutes later and he took our dinner order. While we were enjoying our Pile of Calamari, 2 shrimp and what looked like fried octopus (were not sure cause the waiter didn't wait around to explain anything) Giada showed up and nearly gave me and the lady at the next table heart palpitations and tongue tied my husband when she said hello. (Highlight of the night by the way) then we were left waiting for a little over 30 minutes for our entrees, we received an apology from the manager and received another cocktail on the house (the la Strada is really good by the way) we finally received our entrees about an hour after we were seated I had the spaghetti (very good and would have been better with some shredded cheese but once again the waiter didn't wait around) and my husband had the Italian fried chicken which was very good. I gave 4 stars just because we got to meet Giada but if I gave stars based on service alone I would have given a 2 1/2 maybe a 3 if I was feeling generous. We understand that the owner showed up and that would throw some wrenches in the works but the downfall started before she arrived. I would go back again because it was very good but the price gives the illusion that the service is top notch and we just didn't receive the service expected for the price.",

We arrive on time and are told there they are running about 15 mins behind. About 45 MINUTES LATER and two trips to the hostess stand we are sat. The hostess were unapologetic and just explained that they didn't have a table for two available. So why would I make a reservation for?! It was ridiculous  During this time my friend and I sit at the bar and enjoy a Bellini. The decor is beautiful, the open pizza kitchen is awesome to watch and the floor to ceiling windows give a great view and beautiful lighting. The ambiance is just spectacular. Really well thought out and executed.   Server knowledge was really good. He went over the menu and really guided us through it. But the service itself was slow.  The FOOD. Amazing.  We basically ordered every tapas of cheese and veggies we could. The sage honey served with the parmigiana was just the right amount of sweetness. The mozzarella had a bit of chili flakes with gave it a great little kick. The chicken Marsala meat balls... OMG so good! All the veggies we ordered were also very memorable.  We just order so much Food! We also ordered a pizza with apple balsamic drizzle. OMG I could eat this all day. Sweetness from the drizzle, a bit peppery from arugula and a nice eathyness from the creamy cheese. Pink peppercorns to finish.  At this point we've had two rounds or drinks and full table of tapas. I have no idea how we will get to the entrees! After a bit of a debate we decide to go straight to dessert.... EPIC.  Chocolate tiramisu ... I want to eat this everyday. Just beautiful.  The donuts are light fluffy as the right amount of crispy on the outside. The chocolate it comes with is not overpowering. Finished with some lemon zest which really gave it a clean feeling.  We also have the Nutella espresso drink. Amazing. The food was EPIC. We have already decided to come back to try entrees and have our mind set to taste on a COUPLE of things! Can't wait!  Bravo Giada! Really well done!",

    "text": "Was not sure what to expect as I have been disappointed by other celebrity chef restaurants. Giadas was definitely not a disappointment. The decor was lovely and inviting. My husband and I both started with the Lemon Chicken soup. It was light and super flavorful. My husband had the pan roasted salmon which was cooked to perfection. I had the lobster ravioli. The lemon butter sauce was great. Desert was the lemon souffle served with flourish when the server added the lemon gelato to the souffle.   Why not a 5?  Service is everything to me and while the service was excellent our server Brian did miss on a couple of points. First he never explained the tasting menu. We heard other servers giving great detail on the cost (not on the menu so you are left with asking the awkward \"how much is this\"), options to the menu and other details. The other was after my meal was served I forgot what one of the items was and when he walked by I asked Him and he bent down really close to my plate and said oh I can't even see it. Then he told me it was caviar. I knew it was not but did not say anything on the way out I checked the menu and it was a pumpkin seed gremolata. I expect the server to know the menu and not make it up.",

    "text": "Friday Brunch- Due to pedestrian traffic and parking, we arrived 10 minutes late for our reservation. The first comment from the host was : \"You are Late, so we gave away your table\". ??? We were told we would have to Wait, in a disdainful tone. (First impression). I assumed that meant they were very busy.  In about 15 min, we were taken to a table in a more than half empty restaurant.  It is a beautiful dining area, however, we were given a table in a corner near a small door, which gave us a limited sight. The club chairs are comfortable, but not made for eating at a table , with manners of placing one hand in your lap, as both of my elbows had to be held up above the edge of the chair.    We received instant questioning and service for alcoholic drinks- several times. At the point she determined that the order was non-alcoholic, the waitress disappeared.  Water was provided, and our order taken, with much urging of adding more appetizers and courses. The choices were limited, and most entrees were not special enough to attract attention.  ( I enjoy all kinds of foods, herbs, preparations, and want something that I would not prepare).  Lavish was provided and excellent, leading me to believe that my expectations would be met.    The Lobster Roll was nicely cooked, prepped, and seasoned with a nice plating. ( it was on a crisp bread slice). The mushrooms were very good. No more water was poured, and the waitress disappeared.  We took our time to savor the food and atmosphere and engage in conversation. Not once did she return to check the results. We were finished, with the napkins on the table, and empty glasses, for quite some time before she returned. Water was replenished upon request. She did not ask if we wanted coffee, or dessert, and at that time, we were tired of sitting waiting for her return.     Very Disappointing!  In fact, it was the worst service in my 7 days of eating at various restaurants from moderate to high priced and small to large ownership.  I was tempted to low tip, but felt that would not be specific, so I did quietly tell the waitress what I felt about the quality of service, in case, it might be addressed in the future for others. I would suggest to the management, that they visit Mesa (Bobby Flay's restaurant to experience quality service . Giadas was high on my list, and although my adult son lives in the area, I would never take the time to visit again.  Improvement is Needed.",

    "text": "After securing a reservation two months in advance, our party of six arrived for a Birthday celebration dinner this past Friday night.  This restaurant is beautiful.  The decor is light and upscale, but also feels comfortable.  I liked the waiting area (though it is a bit small) and especially appreciated the complementary photo booth - what a unique experience.  We were seated for our 9:30PM reservations right around 9:30.  Though we didn't get a seat right by the window, we could see the skyline pretty well.  There really isn't a BAD seat in the restaurant.  Our waiter, Rocco was nice.  He was very classy and offered us suggestions on what to order.  I did at some points though out the meal feel out of my league in this \"fancy\" restaurant, but overall I felt welcomed.  The prices here are pretty high, but in line with other \"nice\" restaurants in Vegas.  I found the portions to be pretty decent... some smaller than others, but overall adequate.  Drink prices were very steep, as expected for a posh Vegas hot spot.  The Hubs and I decided to share a few things.  We had the bacon wrapped, sausage stuffed dates.  Yum.  Soft, sweet, spicy, these gems had it all.  Highly recommend.  For our entrees we got the lemon spaghetti and the veal chop.  The lemon spaghetti, though everyone RAVES about it, was a bit underwhelming.  The shrimp it comes with are HUGE.  I think I would have preferred a few smaller, regular sized shrimp.  The dish was lacking something... maybe some pepper or parm topping... not sure, but it was just ok.  The veal on the other hand was amazing.  It was huge and melted in your mouth.  So good... I would for sure get this dish again.  For dessert, even though we were stuffed, we shared three cookies, lemon, peanut butter chocolate, and chocolate chip.  The lemon was amazing as was the peanut butter.  The chocolate chip one was just ok... I'd say get two lemon next time.  The entire party walked away happy with their meal and experience.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat and try out some of the other pastas and appetizers.  Based on the long wait for reservations and how packed the place was I'd say Giada has hit it out of the park for her first restaurant.",

    "text": "There is a LOT of gushing going on about this new place. I luckily snagged a reservation 4 weeks in advance, but a quick search shows that the restaurant is sold out until August unless you want really inconvenient times.  Front of the house was a little awkward. We got there a few minutes early, and they told us they were running on schedule but we'd have to wait until our reservation time. No biggie, I thought. I then watched 4-5 couples walk in after us and get seated before us. Again, no biggie. 15 minutes after our scheduled time the hostess asks if we'd like to sit in the lounge while we wait for our table. Now I'm getting annoyed. What happened to running on time? Luckily we didn't sit too long as they seated us after 10 minutes in the lounge.  I watched as they offered a tour of the place to their guests before they sat down. Were we offered a tour? I'll let you take a wild guess. NOPE - I had to ask for one, and yes, we did receive a tour.  The space itself is gorgeous, with a great view of the strip. There is a classic, traditional look with big, beautiful windows overlooking the Strip. I loved the wood staircase going up to the restaurant. Servers are in white jackets, with plating done tableside. It is pretty elegant with kind of a homely feel.  I guess if you're gonna run episodes of Everyday Italian and Giada at Home on an endless loop on flatscreens above the bar, it better be Giada's place. I mean, why the hell wouldn't she do that? As we ate I was able to watch an easy-to-make peas and prosciutto dish. So I got food and education!  The menu has phonetic pronunciations of all the pastas. In case you're an idiot, they're right there for you. Thanks, Giada.  Also, there are self-portraits of her all over the walls. Not the endearing South Park portraits, however.  Our dishes were excellent.  Bread service was great, as the butter I thought I was spreading was actually mascarpone cheese.  The scallop and crab risotto was our favorite dish of the meal.  Bacon wrapped dates with spicy sausage and gorgonzola crema were also a big hit. The cocktail program is well thought out and executed.  Giada stopped and chatted with us and took a pic after we finished our meal. Very nice lady, and nice to see her buzzing around the place. The tourists will come here in droves.  So food is good, decor and ambience even better, but something was just off with a few things. I still think it was surprisingly a good experience. As much as I thought I would dislike it, I enjoyed my meal there (despite a few hiccups). And the food is quite noteworthy.  Giada is definitely off to a good start.",

We go to Vegas at least once a year and indulge in as many 5 star restaurants as possible.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the food at Giada's.  The food was mediocre at best.  Nothing memorable, nothing to make you want to come back.  The menu was overpriced and portions were small.  Definitely not what we were expecting of fine Italian cusine.    Service was very good and the decor was nice.   Don't waste your time and money.  Definitely doesn't compete with the food quality of Vegas.  Giada needs to stick to TV.  Very disappointed.",

Potatoes were crisp but desperately needed seasoning. The risotto had two small scallops with no sear. Their was virtually no crab in the dish.

While we waited for our table, we started with a bit of coppa, bacon wrapped dates, and charred octopus.  All delicious items!  Drinks were imaginative, tasty, and stiff.   Once we were seated at the table, it went south.  We ordered 3 pasta dishes, 2 mains,  a side, and a bottle of wine.  the Sommelier was awesome and choose a great burgundy, but the food...it just never came. 30 mins into the bottle of wine, the server checked and said there was problem and it would be out shortly...Another 20 mins and a second bottle wine...no food.    Finally after an hour,  a chicken makes an appearance (no pasta yet) with a bit of flourish, disappears for carving and doesn't come back.  It's like they were teasing us!  Well we waited for another 10 mins but unfortunately we had a show to catch at 10PM and after 2 1/2 hours at Giada, we only had apps/alcohol to fill our bellies.  The manager was gracious and comp'd our 2 bottles of wine and apps, but couldn't make right our disappointment or rumbling stomachs during the show.    Hopefully this was just opening jitters as it was the first Friday night they were serving dinner.  Really wished I could of tried more of their food....",

Ghosted images of the food network burned into their retinas.  I had my doubts.  Sure,  it's a monument to narcissism.    Giada  (who I admittedly have no idea who she is or what she does) seems to be \"the leader\" to a throng of rabid followers.  Her image is plastered over every element of the space.   It's over the top and obscene.   So no, we didn't splurge for the autographed photo-menu of Giada.  But you have to give the place credit.  The room is absolutely beautiful.   In a town full of amazing interior design, it's truly a pinnacle of excellence.   Every item in the space is so well thought out.   Colors are magnificent.  Views are awesome.     Also, the food is truly fantastic.   Everything is fresh, well portioned and presented immaculately.     The pastas are particularly delicious and perfect for sharing.  The shining star here though is the service.   Our server for the evening, Radoslav, truly helped make our evening feel special.   He went above and beyond to add his wonderful warm personality to what would otherwise be an immensely impersonal restaurant.    All in all, a surprisingly good evening.",

I expect that if I put out that kind of money that the food would blow me away and at the very least I would leave there feeling full. Neither is the case at Giada's. The portions are insanely small and when you have to shell out $15 for the tiniest arugula salad, well that's over the top crazy to me. It was supposed to come with \"candied lemon\". Ummmm, not a lemon to be found on my plate. I would guess that salad cost .70 to make, at most. The waiter suggested that if you get a pasta dish, you should also get a main because \"the pasta is a rather small portion.\" At $36 for a \"small portion\" of spaghetti with 2, albeit fairly large, shrimp, should really have to pay that much PLUS an extra $50 - $74 for a main? Add any appetizers or salads and HELLO humungus bill! All of this would be fine if you were blown away by how delicious the food was. Sadly was just okay; entirely ordinary. Oddly enough, the best part was the alcoholic beverages that weren't too over priced and delicious. Over all, I left there scratching my head wondering how the 4 of us could have spent so much money and still be hungry. Then I remembered, we got there at one teeny tiny over priced item at a time.",

    "text": "We wandered into Giada's on a Thursday evening (early) without a reservation, but our table was able to be seated quickly.  I did not have particularly high expectations - but the entire experience, both food and service, was outstanding.  We selected the tasting menu, as I usually have a good experience with those when offered.  This was no exception.  The bacon-wrapped dates (one of the appetizers) were amazing.  The table split the pasta offerings, which were equally impressive.  For the entree choice, I selected the lamb (rib chops).  I have eaten lamb throughout my life, even able at times to buy direct from farm to table when a friend of mine was raising his own for personal consumption.  Without question, the lamb served for this entree was unmatched in my experience.  Cooked perfectly is an understatement, and the quality absolutely impeccable.  The meal was followed by a desert selection, each of which was fantastic, particularly the house made gelato (in my case, white chocolate coffee).  I have no idea why Giada's bothers with breakfast and lunch; as a business decision, I can't fathom it - and for a restaurant of this quality for dinner service, it doesn't add up for me.  Drinks, food, service (yep - service was awesome as well) made for a rather unforgettable experience.  Highly recommended.  We even were given a beautiful menu to take home - along with recipes.  Nice final touch to an awesome experience.",

I really don't know how you get off  charging over $30 for a 4 oz portion of pasta. Presentation of the food was also subpar. I think Giada would actually be disgusted at the pizza they served, the pasta portion to price ratio and overall service was definitely not as expected. They fell short of expectations.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying I am  a huge Giada fan! I have watched her for years and tried many of her recipes. When I found out she opened her first restaurant, I was thrilled! We made reservations for 4 a month in advance and all they had open was a 9:45, which was late, but ok. We got there a few minutes early, but they had no problem seating us. I had no idea that the restaurant had a view of the strip, I was simply going for the food! It was incredible! The table was perfect. we could see the Bellagio fountains from our seats. The windows wide open with a nice breeze. I was so happy! We ordered drinks and apps and everything was great. And then...an hour later I had to flag down our waiter and ask him where our dinner was. He simply said they had to re-make one of our dishes. No, I'm sorry or anything. He told us then it would be up in a few minutes. He never came back around to ask us if we wanted more drinks or anything else. We had to flag him down for everything after appetizers. we finally out our dinners around 11:00pm..an hour and a half after we were seated, and they only brought out 2 of the 4 for the first few minutes! By this time, we were to full and tired for dessert, so I ordered some cookies to go. He then brought us the same cookies ( could have told me that before I ordered) as a Happy Birthday treat to my fiance. This service ruined my experience here. I was SO disappointed. Overall, food was decent, but I was probably too tired to enjoy it anyway. I will try this place again strictly for the view and ambiance.",

    "text": "My friends and I drove (4 hours) from the OC to  LV just to try Giada's new restaurant.   Our reservation was for 4:45 pm on Friday night.  It was either the early bird reservation or wait until 10 pm.  We arrived a few minutes early and checked in at the hostess station.  The hostess' are all \"mini Giada's in their dress and small frames. (too bad they weren't as bubbly, friendly or inviting as she is).  While waiting to be seated we took full advantage of the Photo Booth  (which neither Hostess bothered to tell us about) .We took our picture excited to have it print one for us each ( only to realize the printer wasn't working) however, we were able to send to our emails so we were happy!. Now we head to the bar. The decor of the bar and the entire restaurant is beautiful.  The bartender greeted us gave a quick run down and said he would be right back.  When we decided on our drinks, we wait patiently for his return . In the meantime...(2) more bartenders appear.  One directly in front of us and another helping some other customers.  We realize it was early and shifts may have just started as the bartender  directly in front of us was putting money in a till.  However, not once did she acknowledge us, smile or even check to see if we had been helped.  When our bartender appeared we commented on whether he was coming back (to which I understand he didn't take likely) then we ordered. The lemon martini's are to die for but are on the pricey side $22.00 While enjoying our cocktails we started up a conversation with the bartender to lighten him up, once we engaged him in conversation he loosened up and was less uptight and more friendly.   We were seated.  Our waitress stopped by ( in a ill fitted outfit, seemed a little on the wrinkled side) but that wasn't going to be a make or break for us with the menu we had before us!  She excused herself, came back and took our drink order.  In the meantime another employee approached ( I am assuming a runner, or bus boy which was very pleasant) asked if we would like bread.  We said yes and he brought an amazing little pot of rosemary bread, breadsticks, flat bread and different dips and toppings.  There was salt, olive oil, parmesan and red peppers all together  or separate were delicious.  Our waitress returned with our drinks (2) Lemon martini's and a glass of wine $55.00 (pricey). She explained how the menu worked.  We decided that we would start with a few items and then go from there.  She agreed and though it was a good idea. We ordered the Tricolor salad  $16.00.  It sounded so delicious and different than any tricolor salad I had ever tried. ( Mario Batali and Michael Chiarello's restaurants serve (2) of the best)!  The salad arrives. Unfortunately, we do not have any plates on our table to serve up the salad amongst us. We wait for our waitress to come back by and when she does we tell her we having nothing to put our salad on. She apologizes and says there are suppose to be plates on your table  (no kidding) The salad is a mixture of sweet Kale, gorgonzola, dates and prosciutto with what seemed to us a heavy handed mixture of a mayonnaise based dressing.  Unfortunately it was saturated with this.  The flavors amazing, the dressing not so much. Bucatini $24.00 sauce cold. Next came Chicken Marsala Meatballs with roasted wild mushrooms $14.00.  These delicate meatballs were delicious! Cooked to perfection.  Then came the crab and scallop risotto $30.00 the biggest disappointment of all!  When the dish arrived, it smelled \"fishy\" the scallops were slightly under cooked which is the way they should be but could of had a bit more searing along the edges.  The risotto itself was flavorless, no taste what so ever.  It was all under seasoned.  Our waitress would walk by but not once asked if it were to our satisfaction.  We never saw a manager of sort and now our excitement has turned to disappointment.  We decide to pass on any other entrees we pay our bill and leave.  Giada. perhaps you need to read your reviews,revisit and retrain.",

    "text": "Five stars isn't enough to accurately describe my recent trip to Giada. If you take anything away from this review, it should be to take advantage of the four course tasting menu, especially if you don't live near Las Vegas. With the tasting menu, a large and delicious antipasti platter is served and not one thing on the plate is disappointing, but the bacon wrapped dates and pea pesto crostini were the favorites. The pasta courses were stunning and delicious as well, but the table favorite was the Vegetable Bolognese. Amazing is an understatement, such rich flavors.The tenderloin with chimichurri was fanastic, as were the crusted lamb chops and salmon. The real entree star is the Branzino with Tangerine Vinaigrette, it is honestly the epitome of perfection. The dessert cart that comes with the tasting menu is stunning, both in looks and taste. the choices are endless with the gorgeous rose gold cart but we stuck to banana gelato, lemon ricotta cookies, polenta cake, tiramisu, and raspberry sorbet. We recommend them all. We enjoyed our meal so much that we cancelled another dinner reservation to return to Giada before heading home. Both meals were phenomenal here. The staff is amazing, the view is spectacular, and the atmosphere is elegant as Giada herself. This review doesn't even begin to do this restaurant justice, you just have to go and see for yourself! We can't wait to return!!",

    "text": "I love Giada.  She is beautiful, fresh faced and lovely!  I've made some of her recipes after watching Everyday Italian with great results!  I was so excited to dine here on my most recent trip to Vegas with friends.  It was seriously disappointing.  We were seated by a giant open window facing the Paris Hotel.  It was nice to have a fresh breeze and the view was lovely.  However, the wafting cigarette smoke and noise from the street below was counterproductive to a positive dining experience.  Our waiter was pretentious and trying to over sell us on everything, ($125 Tasting selection, with a take home, souvenir menu). This is more of a theme park, pseudo fine dining, celebrity chef, tourist attraction than an actual good restaurant.    I don't want to order cocktails off an iPad.  I don't want to have the waiter tell me what to order at each course and I don't want to have the flow of our conversation abruptly halted each time the waiter has something to say, in what I think was a fake, Italian accent.  Let's talk about the food.  Bread course - what? A large, crispy, flat, cheese crisp - meh A few crisp bread sticks - okay A warm, greasy focaccia - nice but where's the real, good, Italian bread?  On the side, little thimblefuls of salt, fried capers (what's with the capers by the way?  They are in everything), a little pesto oil.  All nice touches but what should I do with them? Try to sprinkle some salt on my crispy cracker or better yet, dip a bread stick in 1/8 teaspoon of pesto oil?  For an appetizer, my husband and I split the Lemon Spaghetti.  It was fine, not great.  No bursting, marriage of fresh, delicious flavors but rather old, unfresh, over cooked shrimp abed a creamy, lackluster pasta that might be featured on a kid's menu.  Main course was described as a whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style. What appeared at our table was the tiniest of all chickens, split in two, on a wooden plank.  Not roasted but more like fried, perhaps oven fried, absolutely flavorless, dry chicken with a bowl of chunky tomato sauce.  Not only was this dish just not good, but it was so poorly described on the menu.  When I read roasted chicken, I am expecting a juicy, flavorful, tender chicken with a delicately crisped skin from roasting in the oven.  When I read \"Cacciatore style\" I expect it to be gently sauced in a fragrant, Italian sauce of onions, tomatoes and garlic.  This was all wrong.  For dessert, our waiter pushed the lemon meringue.  Again, on the menu, it read like a delicious, soft, fluffy, sweet lemon meringue experience.  What appeared at our table was one of those hard, meringues you can buy in a plastic container at Trader Joe's.  It had a puddle of lemon ooze and a bit of whipped cream on it.  So disappointing.  How do you eat this?  There's no way to slice into this brittle meringue with a fork.  This is a dessert I might desperately throw together, in a pinch, if unexpected guests showed up at 8:00 p.m. on a weeknight.  This is not worthy of a sit down restaurant ever!  On our second night in Vegas, we headed to our old standby Mon Ami Gabi and I felt sad for the previous night's experience.  I wished I could invite Giada to come over and join us for a truly spectacular meal.  No gimmicks, no pretension, just solid good food and masterful service!",

I really enjoyed all of the food!  We had an appetizer sampler platter with more things that I can remember (mushrooms, bread and tapas, roasted peppers, olives, bruschetta with pancetta, meatballs and so much more).  All of it was delightful!  I could eat the lemon mascarpone spread they gave us for the bread every day.  The lamb was absolutely the best any of us had ever had.  My short rib pappardelle pasta was amazing.  Friends didn't really care for their spaghetti (it has a rich white sauce, not red sauce) or the ravioli (again a white sauce).  We were all quite disappointed in the standard dessert menu.  We begged our waiter to let us order off the dessert tray that's solely for the four course tasting menu (and he agreed, but, we saw him get in trouble from a manager...POOR GUY.  Don't blame him, blame us)!  The little bite sized desserts were way better than what the options on the menu.  I will definitely be back!",

So, I booked a reservation on OpenTable about 3 weeks out, scooped up 6 folks, and headed to the Cromwell.   Facility:  it's best to come in off Flamingo and use the parking garage or park in Valet as I did. Then it's straight ahead, until you see the escalator on right. Then it's at the top. The restaurant itself is beautiful!  The chairs are comfortable, attractive and vary depending on the table size or area you get. They have some round and square tables and bar seating.  The decor is a very trendy, modern look with Italian influences around the cooking area.  I loved the fire oven for the pizza, fresh drying pasta and antipasto display cases.    Service:  Wasn't too impressed with the hostesses, but the wait staff was pretty good. Christopher was a great waiter, who was very knowledgable and friendly!  He took pictures for us even with no complaint or sign of impatience. I was a little thrown that they support wait staff took the $70 salami plate with food on it when I was in the bathroom. I would have loved to take the leftovers home. Also, maybe Christopher got busy, but at the end, he handed cash change to someone (the wrong person), and then set the rest of the tabs in the middle for us to look through and figure which one was ours.  I've never seen that in a restaurant before. Like I said, maybe he got sidetracked or busy.   Food:  I was pretty impressed with this place. I know some YELPERS had some bad food, but ours was great!  I started with a white sangria (4/5), which was refreshing and delicious. We ordered a meat and cheese plate for 6 to share. Then we each ordered a lunch plate.  Meat and Cheese platter (5/5) for 6 (not on the menu) - It was a little pricey, but it was so cool to try all the meats and cheeses. It had the 4 meats offered in their appetizer section, along with Gorgonzola, Truffle Pecorino, and Parmigiana Regiano. It had an infused honey, with actual pieces of honeycomb. Loved this platter!!!!  Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese (3.5/5) - this was very good. It looked more like a spinach sandwich because there was so much pesto, but it surprisingly did not have an overpowering basil flavor, which I was worried about.  When you bite into a tomato, it really completed the flavors. Not sure how much lemon I tasted. I got the zucchini strings (3/5) on the side. They were good, but lacked some zucchini flavor and a tad greasy.  Lobster Roll (4.5) - shared with my neighbor and I loved this!!!!  But lobster is my all time fav food. Tons of lobster and not just salty claw side of meat.  Overall:  I enjoyed the lunch. I lived the atmosphere, I loved the decor, the service was great, and I liked my food. 4 stars for me!  :)",

    "text": "Before dining at Giada's, I read a few mixed reviews. Some people loved it, others thought it was just alright, A LOT thought it was on the pricey side for Italian food on the strip, so I didn't know what to expect going in. All I knew was that I really enjoy Giada's recipes at home, so I was hoping for the best and expecting to dish out a lot of dough by the time it was over.   We made reservations on a Monday night - 8:30pm dinner. We arrived a few minutes before and were sat down right on time - despite 1 of the 3 hostess earlier telling us it would be about 10mins. (By the way, before being sat, we popped in the complimentary photo booth that is set up in the waiting area, but I will warn you, the camera is completely out of focus, so your photos WILL be blurry. I guess what can you expect when the photos are free, right?)   We did not sit next to the window. My boyfriend made the reservations online and wasn't aware that there were \"better\" seats to request, but we were sat at a table still in clear view of the beautiful view Giada's has to offer of the strip and the Bellagio water show. (TIP: request to sit next to window that they usually have open)  The service was a little slow to begin with. It took maybe around 10mins or so for our waiter to introduce himself, then another 5 to get a drink order in. The drinks didn't show up for a little while longer (longer than you would normally wait) and once our drinks showed up, I was happy. I ordered the \"Flash Gordon\" and the boyfriend got the \"Destroyer.\" Both were bomb diggity.   We started with a few antipasto dishes, ordering \"Giada's favorites\" which consisted of Bacon-wrapped Dates, Seared Tenderloin Crostini and Baby Stuffed Sweet Peppers. We also ordered the Burrata cheese and the Wood Roasted Mushroom Pizzette to start. All were tasty, but nothing absolutely spectacular. For my entree, I ordered her special shrimp and lemon linguine. The shrimp were huge and the pasta was delightful. But again, nothing spectacular. Dish was simple and something people could easily make at home.   For dessert, I was pretty full, so I ordered a coffee (which was yummy) Overall, I would give Giada's three and a half stars. Food was good, but for the price and semi-decent service, I'd rather have stayed home and cooked something equivalently delicious, for a third of the price.",

The terrace view at Giada's was spectacular and the ambiance was perfectly suited for the occasion.  Nancie was warm and welcoming and greeted us with a smile.  She was very knowledgeable about the offerings and made suggestions that would create the best experience.  Her suggestions were spot on.  My wife and I both chose to sample some of Giada's selections and we each chose something different so we could sample from each other's plate.  We shared the lemon spaghetti with prawns and the bucatini with fresh ricotta.  The food was fantastic, the cocktails were mixed with just the right amount to loosen you up and chill you out for the evening.  Then the desserts cart pulled through and we were impressed by the offerings.  Our server was very funny and we thought he was joking about the dessert choices.  He stated we could choose three from the cart and we were shocked he was serious.  The food at Giada's was fantastic, the service from Nancie was exceptional, the ambiance was fitting for the occasion.  It was an evening that my wife and I truly enjoyed!  Thank you!",

Sat for 20min b4 manager came over and noticed we had not been served. She apologized and offered a free meat and cheese platter! Super nice and thanks were given. Waitress came and we ordered drinks. Another 10 min b4 they arrived. Right after my husband said lets just leave!!!   Finally drinks and meat cheese platter arrived. Ordered two more apps. Octopus was great! Fritto misto just ok.   Had asked for lemons with water twice since being sat. 40min in after a third request they finally arrived.   Waitress was hard to find. Management asked how we were doing twice after the first time.   All in all disappointing. :( food was worth coming back for possibly. But they need to pull the workings of their restaurant together!!!! Bad service makes a bad dinner",

The food from the appetizer, one of Giadas personal favorites, through my Chicken Cacciatore were simply amazing.

My family and I had a wonderful time at Giada's and was our first stop on our las vegas tasting adventure and quiet honestly no other restaurants have topped it. The food was unique and great flavors with each. The service we had (sitting at the bar) was FANTASTIC. Our server knew his food and actually guided our whole meal, we loved all has picks. Had 3 different cocktails, the Giagas Cocktail was my fav. Of all dishes the lobster ravioli with lemon mascarpone and capers was mouth watering. My only concern was price for the size of the serving, but other than that what a great experience! I would love to eat like that everyday. Servings were smaller but we left full, with great food like that you do not need to put on a feed bag. Ps anything with prosciutto! YUM... It was like butter.",

    "text": "Dinner last night started off on a sour note - the prices for cocktails or wine are nothing short of ridiculous.  Seriously, $15-$22 for a small glass of wine? It was insulting.  As you can expect from that, the food portions are small and pricey too. I don't necessarily object to small portions, but at Giada the pricing is high. The waiters are careful to warn you not to order a pasta as your entree, as the portion is too small. Odd. $28 is high for pasta most places, let alone one they tell you is just 4-5 oz.  And so it goes at Giada.  In all fairness, The food was mostly quite good.  The exception was the Giada appetizer,  which i would skip next time as it clearly was pre made and sitting in the refrigerator.  Cold crostini doesn't cut it...it felt like airplane food. The food that was cooked to order was SO much better.  The lemon pasta with shrimp was quite tasty, and the rack of lamb was high quality and perfectly prepared. And the bread and flat bread crackers were amazing....the accompanying pesto oil and capers, in particular, were outstanding.  We loved the decor...it's fun and contemporary. But good grief who chose the music? it is awful...much more suited to a club than as a backdrop for dining.  I am not sure we'll return.  I would like to, as some of the food is very good.  But we really would like to see Giada and her staff rethink a few things - starting with the pricing of the wines and the pastas and that absurd music.  Giada the restaurant has potential, but it isn't there yet. I hope they pay attention.",

Got seated by the window, which would have been lovely, but the blinds kept hitting me because the windows were open. Menu got switched to lunch right at 11, but we were there for brunch. After about 5 minutes were served water. Another 10 minutes went by, and never had a server come by. So we left. Got up and left.  The staff, both front of house and wait staff seemed stressed. They didn't seem short-handed, because there was up to 5 hostesses at any given time, and we saw plenty of wait staff.",

I think the chef gave us the fattiest meat since we had the fritto mesto returned twice. Haha. My hubby had the rock of lamb and he said it was the best lamb he tasted ever.

Room was desolate and wide open, had requested a special table near the strip and was surprisingly seated in the interior..... Seemed \"weird\".  Asked our server if we could move to the plush booths that have a great view and were we had sat on our last visit..... Denied!  Waiter who seemed a little miffed said \" they were not seating any booths and we could move to a smaller table near the window.  We accepted but once again .... \"Weird\"!  Not 30 seconds later they seated a party of two in the booths near us..... Once again \"weird\" now bordering on \"strange\".   But I digress..... The meatballs (cool in temp), eggs over easy and smashed potatoes were very good not quite exceptional.  The smashed potatoes seemed a touch off as if the had been reheated but had a nice lemony essence which saved them. Overall I'd say Giada's is in trouble..... Pretty sure it's Giada's in name only because if she owned it she wouldn't accept the level of service..... In the end I'm disappointed I really thought Giada's was going to be special after my first visit...... Unfortunately the restaurant appears to be in a tailspin and I don't see any signs  of effort by the slightly pompous staff to fend off the inevitable..... I'm giving you 9 months tops until a major overhaul.... The room has potential !  You'll never solve a problem until you own it.... Time to step up!",

    "text": "Such a fan of Giada, been to the book signings, cooked the recipes, watch the show! But I have to say this was a big letdown. So many aspects were off. It started with the fact that no one answers the phone, we tried to call for a reservation, we finally got a reservation, booked on-line by the concierge at our hotel, pretty lame as he could not reach anyone by phone either.  We showed up early, bad move. The hostess was rude, condescending and really really snotty. Her feedback was that we would be seated when our reservation was set for. Here's the odd part. There were plenty of open tables, and the table they eventually sat us at were open the entire time we were waiting. Really?!  Ok so the food, my wife and I eat out a lot, at lots of high end spots, and loving Giada the way we do we expected to just love the food in spite of the bad experience that got us to the table. It was tasty and somewhat original, but the salt was over the top, every dish was so over salted, and I love salt, so you rarely hear that from me. Last but not least, the prices, OMG! $16 for 5 small Arancini sausage balls? $32 for 2-3 ounces of the Pappardelle Pork Ragu? I expect to \"pay\" for high end food at a high end restaurant but that's just offensive, seriously it's pasta with about 3 tablespoons of ragu.  Sorry to have to say all of this but between the snotty hostess and the salt mangling of the recipes, it just ruined it for us.",

It took a long time to arrive but the city street view kept us entertained.  We order the second course of pasta when they arrived both were luke warm and the pasta was gummy (possibly from sitting to long) we only had a few bites. after that we never saw  the waiter again. We finally gave up on ordering the main course and flagged down one of the hostess to bring our check. The waiter dropped of the bill and said something (to this day we have no idea what) 200.00 minim to sit at the window and not even completing the meal was very disappointing. We received less service then on a counter at a Waffle House. By the way we are still wondering if the waiters accent and poor English was a put on.",

    "text": "My guess is you are going to love or hate this restaurant.  I recommend, if you are interested in dining here, go with an open mind.  That is exactly what my guest and I did.  Having heard Giada had a rough start and after reading some negative reviews, just had to give it a try.  Glad I did.  First, the Cromwell, which opened about a year ago, is the perfect location for Giada's restaurant.  Her boutique approach to Italian food is a good match with the small, intimate feel of the Cromwell.  The staff at the hostess station were pleasant, professionally dressed, and appeared glad to have us join them for lunch.  In a town so jaded, this was refreshing.  After seating us, the hostess mentioned our server by name, indicating she would be with us soon.  And she was.  In less than two minutes our server arrived, warmly greeted us and on learning this was our first dining experience, offered some drink suggestions.  My guest stated the sangria was perfect for a hot, 100+ degree Vegas day.  We then ordered the Caponata, Chicken Marsala MeatBalls, and the Muffuletta.  The presentation was clean, simple, yet elegant.  Before describing the individual dishes, a thing each dish had in common was a balance of flavors and textures.  Each dish had an ingredient that was to designed to be the focus of flavor, but was well complimented by the flavors of other ingredients.  First the Caponata.  Was stunned how good it tasted, and again, perfect for a hot Vegas afternoon.  The Chicken Marsala Meatballs were unbelievable.  The texture was firm, yet moist and savory. As I am sure you would agree, often meatballs can be oily or greasy.  Not the case here.  These could be eaten by hand, if you were so inclined.  But use a fork and mop up as much of the sauce as possible on each meatball. The Muffuletta is what surprised us the most.  Having spent way, way too many misspent days and nights in New Orleans, I know a great Muffuletta.  As is the case with most of her dishes, Giada did a traditional sandwich, but with a slightly more subtle taste from what I am accustomed to, and she \"knocked this one out of the park.\"  Alert: you might not like this if you are looking for the absolute traditional Muffuletta.  But I think the texture of the bread, the quality and taste of the meats and cheese, along with the not over the top Muffuletta spread were, in my humble opinion, the absolute perfect match. We finished with a cup of coffee that was hot, fresh, and presented in a nice, slightly oversized cup. We also tried the cookie platter for dessert.  I am not a dessert person, but Giada has created a selection of cookies that are very different from each other, yet go well together.  My favorite was the chocolate-peanut butter with the dab of blackberry jam in the middle.  Again, if you keep an open mind and look for how she has combined flavors, I think you will like.  Nice job Giada!",

    "text": "We came in an hour and a half before they closed for dinner and the hostess was in complete disbelief that we had shown up without reservations even though no one else was waiting for a table.  She was clearly put out by our shortsightedness and behaved like she would have to go chop wood to get us a table.  Once we were able to be seated, we walked inside the dining room and there were open tables everywhere.  We asked for one of the open tables overlooking the strip because it was my birthday and it would add to the occasion.  We were told those tables were all reserved but they were still empty when we left.  Instead we were sat in an awkward hallway.  Our server wasn't kind or attentive in any way.  I asked for a lobster roll and he said that item was no longer on the menu but the next closest thing were the pork sliders.  I failed to see the similarity so I ordered a margherita pizza instead.  My mom ordered an appetizer for us to share and a salad.  The cheese she selected for an appetizer came as a single wedge of cheese on a plate at the same time as our entrees.  It was weird, usually cheese is served paired with something but it was just a wedge by itself.  We both agreed that our entrees were delicious but we couldn't tackle that big chunk of strong cheese on its own so we asked for something to go with it but our server never brought anything.  As we sat and waited, my mom noticed that the table next to us was eating a lobster roll, you know - the ones our server told me were no longer on the menu.  Also, their server was continuously filling their ice tea while my mom's glass sat empty at the edge of the table throughout our entire meal, it was never refilled once.  We actually had a lovely time because we were enjoying each other's company but it was hard to ignore the terrible service we were receiving.  As we were leaving, the hostesses just watched us walk out, no \"thank you for coming\" or \"have a nice day.\"  They were the most miserable looking women I've ever seen in Vegas.",

    "text": "I loved Giada.  My wife surprised me with dinner reservations for my birthday on our latest Vegas trip.  I have watched Giada's cooking show for quite a few years and was so excited when she opened her restaurant.  We had a reservation and were immediately seated although it seemed very busy inside.  We had a group of 5 and we all ordered something different so we were able to try a few different dishes.  We were given the option of a tasting menu, served family style, at $120, we did not opt for this as all parties at your table had to partake.  I can understand a minimum of 2 people to do the tasting menu but not sure why the whole table would have to partake.  Everybody loved their food and I would definitely return.  Since it was my birthday, they brought me 2 cookies (lemon ricotta and a chocolate/peanut butter one) on a plate with happy birthday written in chocolate on it.  We started off with some fried calamari and it was oh so delicious, melt in your mouth, tender.  The side of asparagus was a good size portion and was enough for all 5 of us.  I loved the fresh rosemary bread and parmesan crisp bread that they start you off with, there is also lemon butter for spreading and basil olive oil for dipping.",

From the decor, to the service, to the food, to the view, it was all so wonderful. We went straight for entrees this outing and gave the grilled cheese and arugula salad a try! Boy am I glad we did. The salad was so fresh, the vinaigrette dressing was just right and the chicken was to die for! It reminded me of the chicken schnitzel off of the streets of Israel! My hubby got the grilled cheese and \"shoestring fries.\" Toasted to perfection featuring succulent cheese and pesto sauce...need I say more?! The fries were crispy and lightly flavored with vinegar and salt. One word: DELECTABLE. Even though we skipped the appetizers, we sure did indulge in dessert! If you're a Nutella lover, go for the donuts. They come out warm, drizzled with powdered sugar and a side of Nutella. Aside from the stellar food, the service was fast and the server was very knowledgable about the food items. My hubby drinks a ton of water and not once was his glass left empty. Love a conscientious serving team. Do yourself a favor and book a reservation at one of Las Vegas' finest establishments, Giada, the next time you're in town. You won't be disappointed!",

The food has always been amazing, some of our favorites are the lobster ravioli, lemon prawn spaghetti, and the spicy sausage pizzette. What we love the most is the staff. The bartenders (Bo and every person we have had) are always so friendly and welcoming and remember us when we come in.  They are truly top notch! Olivia who sometimes works the brick oven is a sweetheart!  She always has a welcoming greeting and smile when we arrive and always makes sure we have everything we need. This is definitely our favorite restaurant in Vegas and we have been to a lot!  We can't wait for our next trip!!",

We ordered the ricotta and honey crostini appetizer, lobster ravioli, penne pasta, two pizzas and two beautiful desserts. I also ordered the barbarella drink. It had a nice non sweet mix of flavors. The restaurant itself is very classy with a vintage Hollywood feel. The staff was great too, our waitress gave us the right amount of attention and our water glasses stayed full (very important to me). The reason I give it three stars is because the portions are ridiculously small. I expect big prices and small portions because... Vegas, but seriously. Go here, but don't go hungry ;)",

I was able to sit by the window and after awhile they opened them up for some air which was nice.  Tt was fairly quite being there closer to the True breakfast time vs. brunch. I was able to get in without reservations. Things filled up as I was finishing up, but the service was good and the food was delicious.  It was very filling though so I would recommend coming really hungry or splitting with someone.  It was a bit pricey, but I was expecting the price tag so it wasn't much of a shock.  I would definitely recommend Giada especially if you are a fan of hers and want a nice meal while on the strip.",

Bucatini and another which I cannot remember the name of, but both were earthy and the kind of pastas you would want in the dead of winter because you know they will do your soul good.  For my main, I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly.  Several people at our table had the huge steak, which they enjoyed as well.  Desserts were the limoncello souffle, the chocolate tower and the crostata.  As far as drinks go, Giada went above and beyond from the delicious \"Destroyer\" cocktail to how they handled the nicer bottles of wine we brought... Which were decanted and handled with great care.  Thank you to the sommelier Danielle for making sure our tables wine glasses were never empty and thank you to Giada for being the icing on the cake and coming over and talking with our table!",

Depending on the time of day and your seating location you may even take in a view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was a bit slow and we spent roughly 15 minutes there before anyone came to our table, but our server seemed to have a number of tables so we can certainly understand the delay. We were there for lunch and as this was a special occasion, we brought our own bottle of wine. The corking fee was a bit high (but not for Vegas prices) at $35, but it was still a steal considering that almost every wine on the list was an ultra premium wine. Once we ordered, our food came out exceptionally fast. We highly recommend the baked pasta of the day, the Buratta cheese (buffalo mozzarella), Baby Sweet Peppers and Marinated Olives. Our total dining experience lasted over 1 1/2 hrs. We were so fulfilled by the time we left. In the end, when our check came, we found that the corking fee was not on it. This may have been due to the fact that we bought so many dishes during lunch or maybe our overwhelmed server simply forgot, but we weren't complaining :)   I would highly recommend Giada's for lunch!  All their food is fresh and homemade, which is somewhat rare these days, even on the strip.",

    "text": "We visit Vegas often and have learned to avoid overpriced food \"experiences\" on the Strip.  We usually venture off the strip for dinner.  However, I had heard great things about Giada from friends and family.   The atmosphere was awful and colored my whole entire meal.  Firstly, it was *hot*.  We visited in March and had on blouses and pants.  Nothing very heavy.  And we were both sweating for most of the meal.  I think the windows were open, but in the back part of the restaurant it was hot, with no cool air. Sitting down you are overwhelmed by the table setting.  So much on the table!  Nearly everyone managed to knock over the bread knife balanced on edge when they sat down.  It makes a big clatter.  Then the waiter shows up with multiple menus, an iPad, a cheesy \"tasting\" menu you enticed to order so you can have an autographed photograph of Giada.  I had approximately 5 different things to look at.  And no room to put them anywhere on the table.  Some of the menus were redundant.  But I had no idea which one was the actual menu and had to ask. The food was, meh. The bread was the highlight.  We had stuffed dates, grilled baby peppers and a nice lemony salad that was dressed perfectly.  All of these were tasty, but nothing special.  We had lobster ravioli which was bad.  The pasta was mushy and a little gooey without much filling.  It was placed over large chunks of greens, which were impossible to eat with the gooey pasta.  I was shocked the pasta would be so awful. But the timing of the food was awful.  Almost 1 minute after ordering, food started coming out and being shoved onto our very tiny, overdressed table.  Oftentimes, the waiter would stand awkwardly with the plate while we tried to move stuff around to make room to squeeze it in.  I think we had 3 plates brought out within 5 minutes of ordering.  I had to have them hold the salad because, well, there was no room and we were still working on the first two plates. I will not return.",

Everyone should try this place you have never had Italian like this.  Bring your appetite because it's hard to choose from all the great items so it's very easy to over order.  Thanks again Giada",

I'd go there again for drinks and appetizers, but not dinner.",

Great parking, casino not too crowded, perfect view.  But....I was surprised how long it actually took to get an order placed.  We were told as soon as we sat down the kitchen was backed up...but 30 minutes to place an order? we kept saying we were ready? Too OMG.....red wine served in a white wine glass......I could hardly sit through dinner....after 3 glasses I had to ask..were all the red wine glasses dirty? This was an Itialian restaurant..? Why was I being served red wine in a white wine glass????? The server apoligized and after 3 glasses brought me a prpoer glass? final check over $300 for the two of us...it was just ok...I was disappointed.....I expected more.  My husband commented my salad, & bacon wrappeddates were better...? I really expected more for the money.",

The small pizzas were very good and the spicy pasta delicious. The dessert cart was very nice. I would go back but honestly I would go to the bar and just order appetizers.",

Only allowed us corkage for 2 bottles, which I think is ridiculous when you have a big party that brings what they like to drink with what is supposed to be great food. While the place itself was amazing, the food itself was average at best. We had to return 2 dishes because they were undercooked and the rest were anywhere between very good and, honestly, borderline bad. Place is overhyped. Will not go back again with so many other great options.",

We didn't even get somebody till almost 15 min after we were seated. Our app was the calamari and it just tasted like ocean. I had the veal chop and it just takes like a pan fried pork chop. Nothing special. The employees weren't exceptional. For being on the strip it was a let down. Also what kind of Italian restaurant play hip hop? The atmosphere quite honestly ruined most of the dinner.",

Having watched Giada's show for years, having lived in Italy as a child, and currently living in Las Vegas now, I was super excited for a female Italian chef to open an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant right here on the strip. Unfortunately, the only positive about the restaurant is the restaurant itself. Located inside the Cromwell Hotel and Casino: The ambiance creates an airy, fun-filled scene, with beautiful breathtaking views and whimsical white-washed shutters that allow the summer winds to slowly blaze in. The visuals of an Italian deli and candid photo booth add the right amount of style to the gorgeous setting. However, the food is nothing more than mediocre: The portions are small, the prices are high, and the service is non existent. Too much hype for a very expensive price.",

The pasta of the day was lasagna which was severely over priced for the product. I would not recommend  to someone who I looking to have a nice Italian meal. The service was ok. Our waitress was knowledgable but on the slow side for there not being very many people in the restaurant.  Overall I would classify this restaurant as an over priced Olive Garden.",

I was so disappointed with the service, they were disinterested, left us for ages and only showed and sold us the expensive tasting menu, which we purchased as we didn't realize that there was another one for that evening, until we saw the people next to us eating something different.   The pasta was over cooked and tasteless and for that amount of money, I expected excellent service and meal.  At the end they give you a iPad to write a review and say if you were satisfied.  They could see And read I was not and to this day, no reply or follow up. Terrible customer service   Will not recommend to anyone. Disappointing to say the least",

The staff was friendly and very attentive and helpful with drink and menu suggestions. The meal was well beyond what I expected, Each course left me wanting more ,started with the Antipasti and loved every bite the bacon wrapped dates were wonderful I could have eaten just a plate of them. The lemon spaghetti with shrimp and sicilian roasted lamb were excellent,the hand made off the chart deserts will have you wanting to try them all once that desert cart stops at your table ,they are very rich ,but hey its Vegas go for it ! I would definitely say this is a must when in Vegas ,but I wouldn't think about breakfast or lunch ,this is a five star place and a must ,go for dinner and you'll see what you've missed if you were on the fence .I will definitely suggest Giadas to friends!! I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!!!!",

    "text": "As a diehard Giada fan, when I found out I was going to be in Vegas for Valentines Day, I immediately booked reservations for my husband and I, as well as a couple we were traveling with. We ended up going for lunch and were seated promptly. However after being seated, my friend and I ordered bellinis to which our server said they were the last two, as they were out of peach puree. Um it was 12:15...on Valentines Day. Why not plan ahead for a holiday like that when it's one of the signature drinks?! Anyway we carried on and put our napkins in our lap to which my friend looked in horror as she had a brown, wet dirty napkin in her lap that thankfully didn't stain her clothes. We ordered antipasti, the chicken Marsala meatballs (they tasted frozen) and the Parmesan with honey (just crazy large chunks of cheese). We weren't too impressed but had hopes that lunch would be better. I ordered the Venetian panino since I had seen the episode where Giada makes this and it looks delicious. Needless to say it was soggy and tasteless. I could make better at home. The zucchini scappece that accompanied it is in definition supposed to be marinated zucchini in vinegar...this was just fried zucchini strips. Not even recognizable as zucchini to be honest. My husband had minestrone soup which he said tasted like Campbell's. My friend's farro salad was the only edible (but not great) choice. To top it off, once our first Bellini was gone we decided to switch to sangria...which was basically club soda with fruit in it. By the time the dessert menus came, we were over it. Words cannot express my disappointment. I love Giada and watch her show religiously. I have been to two of her book signings, I cook her recipes almost weekly and many have become staples. I truly cannot fathom that Giada thinks this is GOOD food. If I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. I'm interested to see if this restaurants lasts, as there are so many better choices than this.",

Very spacious, good views of the neighboring hotel. The only downside was it was HOT in the restaurant. With the open kitchen and wood fire ovens, this likely attributed to the problem. I am never one to complain about temperature and can tolerate heat well. We didn't let this get to us and proceeded ordering our meal.   We started off with giada's favorite appetizers which were good and would order them again.   We then shared the spaghetti and risotto. By the time these came out, the warmth of the restaurant was getting to us. The spaghetti was a little heavy, flavor was subpar. The shrimp were very over cooked, so over cooked that I could barely swallow them. We took one bite of the crunchy risotto and couldn't eat anymore.   When the waiter came, i mentioned how uncomfortable the temperature of the restaurant is and how we were hoping to cancel the rest of our meal and get our check. Rather than be apologetic, he was short with us, which was disappointing for a high end restaurant.   Unfortunately, I was hoping to capture good memories at Giada's.",

The polenta muffin was delicious, sort of like a sweet cornbread muffin. The banana muffin and monkey bread were other highlights. There is a wide selection of brunch menu options. We will definitely be back next time we're in Las Vegas!",

Only the appetizers were disappointing, and unfortunately we made the rookie mistake of filling up on them.  For starters, we got the orzo meatballs, chicken Marsala meatballs, fried sausage balls and spinach and ricotta pizette. Definitely did not need 4 apps for 4 people - 2 would have been fine. Of the starters, the chicken Marsala meatballs were by far the best. The sausage was good as well, but neither the orzo meatballs nor the pizette had much taste. Wish we had skipped those so I could have finished my entree, the parpadelle with pork ragu, which was excellent. My husband had the bone-in rib eye, which he loved. No one had room for dessert, but next time my plan is to go easy on the starters so I do!",

I ordered the Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro as I am a huge gnocchi lover.  Unfortunately, it was so disappointing.  The gnocchi lacked authenticity, texture and flavor.  They looked and tasted like they came out of a box and were very undercooked.  I was expecting them to look and taste more homemade, have a fluffier bite, but that was not the case. The sauce was tasty, though.  Everyone else's food looked good.  I'm not giving up yet and would like to go back, probably for dinner.  I just expected so much more. Not a great first impression.",

The Gibson was $15.00 and the Apple martini was $17.00.  They had decided that I needed Grey Goose in my apple martini unbeknownst to me.  Both Martinis didn't even come close to filling up the small martini glasses.  Next we ordered the buratta cheese plate.  It came with the cheese and a tiny row of salt.  Nothing else.  Where was the bread, balsamic, prosciutto or anything else to compliment it?  We were suppose to eat it with a spoon with nothing else.  I guess simplicity is the answer.   We ordered the orzo meatballs.  They were the size of large jawbreakers and had no flavor that a beginner cook couldn't figure out.  I'm sorry but this was ridiculous.  Then for $37.00 we had the Brancino.  We had to skin it ourselves.  I had skin all over my hands.  The venue is beautiful, but these Strip restaurants are out of control and we live here.  What a disappointment.",

    "text": "I will begin by saying that I've never had a meal here; I tried with no luck.  I was in charge of organizing a special dinner in Las Vegas for a group of coworkers, knowing that Giada's recently opened this was the first place I called. When I called, I was told that because I was making a reservation for more than 10 people that I had to speak with someone else, I was transferred to a different line and asked to leave a message with all details. I left a very detailed message on a Thursday, no one called me back so on Saturday I call again, I was told to call again on Monday. At this point I was beyond annoyed, but I decided to wait and call. I call back on Monday, I speak to a nice lady, I explain my situation, she told me she would transfer me to a manager, but that a) either his voicemail would be full or b) if I was able to leave a message he would more than likely not call me back. At this point I asked her to be honest with me and asked if I was better of just taking my business elsewhere, her answer? YES, you are better off going elsewhere because no one will call you back.   Now, I know that this is a new restaurant, but what ever happened to good customer service?!? I will NEVER eat here, and I will highly discourage everyone I know from going here as well.    As the nice lady suggested, I took my business elsewhere. I made a reservation for my 14 guests at Botero, they were quick at answering the phone, emailed me a proposal the same day, and the day of the dinner took great care of us.  Sorry Giada, your food may be great, but you need to take a close look at who is talking to your potential customers. Your restaurant will not be the hot spot forever, so when the newness wears, and the hype is over, how will you fill your tables?",

They provide bread (same dough as they use for their pizza) with pesto, also very tasty. We followed that with a salad each. My friend ordered the chopped tricolore and I had the Italian farro.

Waitress spilled water onto table when initially serving with minimal wiping. Antipasti tasting was very nice with cheeses, olives and a tomato tapanade. Margarita pizza and grilled cheese served hot and excellent.  Chicken meatballs in marsala was served cold....why????? Its a hot appetizer!! No excuse, just re-served a little warm, and not really hot! Wait staff inattentive..lunch not worth the ambiance or the cost! Checked off the bucket list without recommendation to the public.

Also, I REALLY wanted the yummy lemon spaghetti I'd had there for dinner but was told it wasn't available because a \"different crew\" makes the dinner menu. Seems like it would be easy enough to throw some lemon sauce on pasta, but what do I know? Silver-ISH lining: they overheard we were celebrating a belated birthday so sent some cookies when they finally brought the bill, however, there were three of us and they sent just two, super small cookies. Really, you can't even give us enough for each of us to try? Trying to be too hoity-toity when the experience didn't back it up.",

    "text": "I am rating Giada 2 stars not because of the food (which I will cover in a bit), but because of the inattentive service provided by our server Nancy.  Here is the story.  We had reservations for 9pm (a party of 6) and waited just a few moments to be escorted to our table.  We were sat at a nice table adjacent to the window, and were initially greeted with a smile by Nancy.  She seemed very enthusiastic and eager to please. Upon taking our drink order, she proceeded to explain the menu and we were on our way.  About 30 minutes into our course servings, one of my guests spilled a drink by accident.  When we shared this with Nancy, she brought over a new drink.  However, she did not share much care to see if our guest was ok (some of the drink spilled onto him).  No offer of assistance whatsoever.  From that point forward, she seemed to be more annoyed with our table than supportive, and spent  the majority of her time serving smaller tables adjacent to ours.  When she did stop by, it felt more \"matter of fact\" vs. engaging from a customer service perspective.  Now the supporting wait staff was great, and they were very engaged throughout dinner.  Nancy, however, did not seem to have the same attentiveness I would expect at a restaurant like this, especially being our head server.  Understanding that the tip was preset at 18% for a party of 6 or more, I may have chose less based upon her lever of service.  I hope much of that went to the support staff.......I am not sure I would bring back a party like this again if I cannot get a higher level of service from start to finish.  I have spent a lifetime serving others in the food / beverage and retail industry, I expect better at a 5 star restaurant like this (and you should to).  Now on to the food.  Drinks - Very cool selection of specialty drinks that very tasty!  Appetizers - Bread and salt / sauces were amazing!  You cannot miss with the Salumi e Formaggi platter (simply amazing!)  Dinners - probably some of the most AMAZING food I have eaten!  The flavors were to die for, almost did not want desert to spoil the moment.  Deserts - The desert cart had something for everyone.  Again, wonderful flavors!  I would hope that management at Giada look into this to help improve the quality of service offered.  When you spend a small fortune on dinner and an experience, you expect more.  Giada fell short of our expectations this time around.  Maybe they will get another shot at redemption down the road.",

The restaurant, waiting area and bathroom were clean in so many ways. Prices were decent for a place off the strip. My wife and I will be visiting this restaurant again whenever it gets warm enough for the restaurant staff to open all the windows. Recommend making a reservation prior to going there.

Finally, they rolled over the dessert cart and we each got to select 3 desserts. They told us to take all the desserts and they would pack up what we didn't eat. We ate a banana gelato and a polenta cake while we were there as we didn't think they would travel well and took the other 4 desserts back to the hotel, thoroughly enjoying them for breakfast the next morning.",

We appreciated her grandparents film history displayed through out the restaurant.  Also, service provided by Molly at the bar was very good.    Unfortunately, those were the only two bright points of our visit.  When looking up the lunch times on their website, it indicated that lunch is over at 1:00PM.  Just to make sure, I called and was told that lunch was served until 3:00PM.  We decided to rush over to check it out.  Got there at exactly, 2:32PM.  When checking in we were told that lunch service in the dining room was over at 2:30PM, but that we could have the lunch menu at the bar.  I explained to the hostess that we were not told that when we called, and at this point she became defensive and rude.  I wanted to leave, but my husband said let's give it a chance.  So we did.  Molly, the bartender was sympathetic to our situation and was very sweet  However, she seemed to have prepared answers for us.  I am sure this has happened before.  As we sat at the bar, we couldn't help but noticed just how many empty tables were available in the dining room.    Now for the menu.  As many others have mentioned, what the lunch menu lacks in hearty plates, it more than makes up for in high prices.  Molly recommended both the Orzo and Marsala meatballs.  We got both, at $18 each.  Well for this price I am sad to say, we got 4-5 small meatballs each; they were mediocre; it was so sad.  We also got complimentary pita bread, four little triangles. Honestly, we were afraid to ask if we could have more afraid of what they might charge us.  Molly asked if we would like anything else.  At this point, my husband had had it. and we both gave a resounding NO.  The bill came, and along with the bill, they give you an IPad for comments.  My husband took care of the comments.  An interesting thing happened while he was typing his comments, another person's comments came through on his screen.  Who ever was inputting his or hers comments indicated that no matter how good their waiter was, it could not make up for the lackluster food, portion size, and high prices.     In addition, another customer sitting about three seats from us was complaining to his bartender about the portions and prices, started to feel sorry for those bartenders.  About 5 minutes after 3:00PM a couple sat at the bar next to us.  Molly explained them that now they were serving the bar menu.  The female in the couple asked if they could have soup.  Sadly Molly replied that the bar menu did not include soup.  However, she said she would ask anyhow.  She came back and happily informed them that they could have the soup.  I couldn't wait to see what the soup would look like.  It came in the form of about a cup of what appeared to be chicken broth, which the couple happily consumed, goodness gracious.  At this point, we knew we were in a restaurant that does not cater to their customers, but the customers cater to the restaurant's ego.  Overall, very disappointed.  It's a shame because I do like Giada as a chef and TV personality and like others have made some of her recipes with great reception.  I also appreciate her background.  Since I was a child, I have watched some of  De Laurentiis' films.    Unfortunately, we will not be back to what at this time is a True tourist trap. We really wanted to like this restaurant and wanted to bring our grown children on a return trip this November, not happening.  I hope they will fix some of their issues by implementing  the fresh customers' comments so that others may enjoy their visit.  To me a good Italian restaurant offers good and abundant food, fair pricing, and an accommodating  friendly staff.",

We ordered the popular brunch tasting menu (salmon cake benedict option) and the yogurt parfait.   Tasting menu is nothing but small. Between the three courses, it's a heavy meal. I wish they didn't place the salmon cake on the soggy veggies.  I did not personally taste it but I was told that the Ricotta cookie ice cream sandwich was out of this world. Loved the parfait. Light and a great combination of textures and flavors.  Service - 5/5 Food - 3.5/5 Ambience - 3.5/5",

We didn't plan on eating on the strip but after walking around with our family who was in town visiting, we figured we definitely worked up an appetite. I am not entirely sure how we even made it their with the penetrating heat, but I will definitely say I am happy we did.  The only problem we had upon arrival was the dress code, one of our members in the group had a tank top, we were denied access to dine because we were out of dress code. But luckily there was a shop nearby for him to grab a shirt- problem solved!  So definitely consider the dress attire when coming to dine dine with Giada. Overall the experience was phenomenal, the staff and waiter were very attentive through out the night. The recommendations were definitely helpful on deciding what to eat. The detailed information helped you to understand what some of the dish consisted of. Would I come back? Yes! The service and food was delectable. The service alone would bring me back. The dishes are definitely not ordinary or something you can replicate on the wind. I enjoyed my dish Ravioli- lobster and mascarpone cheese- topped with crunchy artichoke  The artichoke alone should be a dish on its own- I found myself wanting more of those crispy morsels. The dessert from the kids meal was so generous for the 11platter, I was so amazed it came with the meal. I thought that was brilliant considering we were so full to order for us to indulge with the kids",

Next, the location is great. If getting a table for 2, request a window seat to get views of the Bellagio Fountains.  Finally: the food. We went for brunch and got the brunch tasting menu. I really enjoyed the pastries and salumi plate that came out. That was probably the highlight of the meal to me. I got the Lasagna and my wife got the Italian Chicken and Waffles. Both were solid, but nothing special. Just good. For dessert, my wife got the sherbert ice cream sandwich deal and I got the Espresso Tower deal, which was basically an ice cream cake, cut large enough for 4 people to share!  If you are a Giada fan, you will like it and pick up on the vibe and atmosphere of the place. The food ranges from pretty good to really good but nothing was special.",

    "text": "Discovered Giada after Center Cut at Flamingo, thankfully, stopped serving 30 minutes early one day.  Started looking for a nice place to dine that I could still charge to my room at Flamingo and someone recommended Giada; they're also open later and apparently don't cut new patrons off early, even on a slow Monday.  My first experience, and only thus far, was excellent.  Sat at the bar and received fantastic service from Jhovanny.  He was attentive and a pleasure to talk to.  Drinks: decided to make myself a sparkling wine flight.  A Yelp check-in got me a free glass of prosecco; well technically the check-in offer was for a \"splash\" of prosecco but it was sufficiently large that we'll just call it a glass.  Moved on to a CA-based sparkling wine blanc de blancs which was quite good.  Wrapped up with a glass of Moet.  No hint that any had been sitting out for long, excellent temperature.  Food: the shrimp cocktail was great.  The shrimp are the size of a baby arm, but were perfect in texture and flavor, not over or under cooked, easily eaten by hand if desired.  The cocktail sauce is supposed to be an in-house specialty; it was good, but I'm not sure I'd be as braggadocious about it as the restaurant seems to be.  Don't get me wrong; the appetizer was great, they just make a big deal of the sauce and I'm not sure I'd go that far as it wasn't a difference maker for me.  The scallops & risotto entree on the other hand; that is an entree I'd shout about.  Perfectly prepared, even at what was 10:20p on a Monday night.  If you're looking for mega portions, it isn't that, so you may want to go to Dennys instead, but it was otherwise perfect.  Will definitely be back on my next Flamingo work trip, and sorry Center Cut, but closing early let me find a much better option, so will likely never be back.",

Also had the mushroom crostini appetizer and the crab arancini. Just right. Definitely bring your wallet full because this place isn't cheap but it's definitely worth every dollar.

    "text": "I am very disappointed to say this but the service here was so bad last evening that my party decided to actually get up and leave before we placed our order. It's unfortunate since I've been to Giada many, many times in the past and enjoyed the food but service is key in the restaurant business and it has consistently declined over the past year or so.   To begin, we arrived 20 minutes before 8:15  PM reservation and were told that our table would be ready in about 15 minutes. That time came and went as did 8:30 PM and 8:45 PM., with nary an update from the srafff. While I suspect many tables were being held by diners who wanted to watch the Independence Day fireworks, there is simply no excuse for not at least telling us that we hadn't been forgotten. Many parties between two and eight came and were seated. Given that the lobby space was so crowded, I happened to be standing right next to the hostess stand and heard patrons arrive and announce their reservation time. Mind you, this was not a one hostess situation or two. There were five employees working the hostess stand. Finally after my third attempt to find out what the delay was, I lost it because the hostess didn't even seem to be able to find my name.  We were immediately seated at a table next to the bus station in the corner. Speaking to the manager was a total and absolute sham. He told us tyhe other people who would been seated before us had reserved with a credit card. I have worked in restaurants long enough to know that the credit card reservation ploy is... Absolute BS as a way of avoiding being in more hot water. I have made many reservations online and in person and on the phone at Giada and never once have I ever been asked for a credit card.  To placate us the manager said that when they opened the windows for the fireworks we were welcome to walk over and take pictures. That was the absolute last straw. Not only do they keep repeat customers waiting for an hour on a reservation while others were seated in front of them, they chose a corner by the waiter's station and then had no good reason for it.   Yes there was an offer to comp dessert. I specifically told the manager I wasn't looking for comps, only good service and a nice table for having waited so long. By that time the evening was truly ruined and I decided better to just leave because I really don't like making a scene.  On the way out the hostess tried to apologize and say they were finding us a better table. I simply told her that the evening was ruined, I wouldn't be back and the staff at Giada has a lot to learn about service.",

    "text": "I pulled onto the Las Vegas Strip and the first thing I see is the word \"Giada\" lit up on the side of the Cromwell. I think to myself, \"that can't be Giada, like the chef can it?\" I'm a huge Giada fan and have several of her cookbooks, I was intrigued. Well I go about my trip and finally, on a Saturday night, we find ourselves with no plans for dinner. I jump at the chance to call up Giada and get a reservation, which was a cinch.   Let's start with decor...it is amazing. It is sophisticated, modern, and a bit Californian, just like our beloved chef. It is decorated with lots of white furniture, natural wood, clean lines with the occasional pop of color. The ambiance is great with lit candles everywhere and dim lights, I was instantly relaxed.   We decided to head to the bar and order some of the custom cocktail creations before our reservation. I opted for the Giada take on a Pisco Sour, I can't remember the name. So dang good and frothy. At dinner we each ordered our own meal but ordered a couple of starters to snack on and share before. We shared the Arugula Salad that had this huge piece of parm laying delicately across the top, so yummy. We shared a Crostini, some other cheeses, and some salamis. In all honesty, that is all we needed we were stuffed. But I got the Lobster Ravioli and it was so rich and delicious. I only needed three bites and I was satisfied. We decided to ditch dessert and get glasses of Proseco that were perfection. The server's recommendation was on point.   So why a four star review? I felt a little blindsided by the server. Look, I get the upsell, I was a server for many moons. But to totally embellish about the dishes was shocking. Our server said we would need to order 2-3 dishes as the restaurant was tapas style. So that's what we did. Um no, our dishes, including the apps, salads, and entrees were a full size. Now were they chain restaurant sized portions? No, but they were a full dinner plus some to take home sized. I felt like she did this to make the bill increase, and we walked out spending about $50 each more than we should have.   Overall the food was fantastic: fresh, light, full of flavor, and not over the top. I would definitely come back, especially as the menu is seasonal and is consistently changing!",

He was funny, knowledgeable with all our question, honest with his suggestions even with things regarding the strip and great with getting our dishes. His partner was very quick in making sure our drinks were always full. We had a groups of 5. We ordered the Orzo and Calamari appetizers, and they were so good! Our group ordered Scallops, Salmon, Spaghetti, Lobster Ravioli and Broccolini - we shared everything and loved everything! It was all so very tasty! We ordered 2 desserts shared as well: souffle, hazelnut brownie. We love coming here! Always such an enjoyable dining experience.",

The food overall was okay, I think it really depends on what you order. The top dish would probably be the lobster ravioli, I HIGHLY recommend (there were humongous chunks of lobster meat and no fillers). The disappointments were the burrata, nothing special just a piece of cheese on a plate, the arugula salad sounded good on the menu description but was highly highly over salted :( and I had to force myself to finish because I felt it was pricey, another disappointment was my bucatini--I found a string at the middle of the plate. The good news was that our waiter was extremely apologetic and gave it to us on the house. I wasn't too unhappy about the string, especially because it could've been a lot worse (a hair, or something more gnarly lol). The dessert ended things on a sweet note I do have to say! The white coffee was probably the most interesting flavor of the night, never tried anything like it. Would've been cool if Giada had made a special appearance haha",

First course was a meat antipasto and salad.  Second course was pasta- bucatini and veggie rigatoni which was exquisite.  Third course was salmon, fried chicken and filet.  All were perfect.  The dessert trays were amazing!  We had two really fine red wines poured throughout the meal.  We finished with espressos and coffees and everyone agreed it was an amazing birthday celebration.

We asked for a table with a nice view, and were sat by a window overlooking the Strip. The ambiance and service were great.   As for the food, my fiance ordered a meatball appetizer, arugula salad, and risotto with scallops. He particularly liked the salad and risotto. I had an eggplant parm appetizer, beet salad, and vegetable Bolognese. All were good, but the vegetable Bolognese in particular was so delicious. We ordered cookies for dessert, which came with a lemon ricotta cookie, a chocolate peanut butter cookie with a raspberry filling, and a brown butter chocolate chip cookie. I was also given a plate with an extra lemon ricotta and choc peanut butter as a birthday treat. All were tasty, but the chocolate peanut butter one was definitely my favorite.   The best part of our evening came in between our salad and entree course. We noticed a bit of commotion at the table next to us and quickly realized that Giada was there, chatting and taking pictures with every table. When she got to our table, we got to chat with her for a few minutes and she wished me a happy birthday, congratulated us on our engagement, and took a couple pictures with us.  I would've been completely happy with my experience at the restaurant even without Giada being there, but it definitely made my night. I'm so glad we were able to try out her restaurant, and would love to go back in the future.",

We live in Las Vegas and can tell you the atmosphere is pretty good. The food better than average.  The management a little lacking.    Would we go back.  Probably if there was event there but I doubt we would make a special trip as we would not want to wait 30-45 minutes after reservation scheduled to eat.   I mean if the food was a 10 maybe.  But it's better than average so there is no reason to wait that long.  I think once the \"new factor\" wears off they will have to step it up to compete in that market against stiff competition.",

Upon being seated we were greeted by the manager Laurant, and invited to a table which had just come available.  It was a wonderful window table with an amazing view.  We started with two outstanding signature cocktails and four appetizers. Orzo meatballs, marinated olives, a blue cheese plate with pears and honeycomb and a crostini. By the time we were done with the appetizers we had gotten into our bottle of wine which was suggested to us by Darius, the master sommelier. He nailed it.  Next was a kale salad and it was fabulous. Our last dish was a truffle barley pasta. All dishes were genuinely flavorful and delightful.  To finish it all off we had a couple of little desserts and coffee.  Our server Kevin allowed my to enjoy my dishes at my pace. I eat slow and savor my meals. I felt comfortable to enjoy the ambience, my wife, the view, the wine, and the food for all it was worth.

Did I say the service was also top notch?  As busy they were tonight, our waiter Ron was on top of things.  His suggestions for my wine was spot on.  His assistants kept our glasses full and diligently cleared the plates when done.  The manager even came over to greet us and see how things were for us.  Although Giada wasn't in the house, the staff certainly made us feel at home.  Finally, they also serve complimentary Parmesan lavosh, rosemary bread, and breadsticks with the dinner.  Eating it with the pesto or the marscapone butter, which they provide as condiments, really makes a great addition to the meal.  This is certainly a celebrity chef restaurant that lives up to its reputation.",

Nice Tuscany wine selection, reds were tasty. All that was left of the lemon bundt cake dessert were crumbs. This place met our expectations, a bit pricey, but worth every bite! The service was great, especially from Ron and his crew. We will be back!",

    "text": "We had a table with a view which I would say makes the experience just that much more memorable!  We started with the Olives, the roasted mushrooms and the Orozo Meatballs. All very tasty, but by far the mushrooms are a must if you enjoy mushrooms. The Meatballs were good, but a little lacking in flavor which seems to be the consensus with other reviews. Nothing a pinch of salt won't fix, better not enough salt then to much!  The sauce from the meats balls in the other hand we all wanted to eat with the bread and everything else!    I orders the Hannibal as a cocktail which was way to much ice not enough Hannibal, but the taste was good. Not my favorite , but still tasty and great with my meal.  We had the risotto with scallops , the spaghetti signature dish, salmon (which believe it or not in my opinion was the best dish of the night)  and the 7oz filet!  For sides asparagus which was delicious , potatoes were super tasty and my all time favorite the corn!  I ended up adding the corn the the spaghetti which made the spaghettini a super delicious dish because of of all the flavor in the corn that it added to the pasta.  Deserts we  all amazing and the lemoncello did not disappoint.  For sure a good place for a date or a special event as it was easy to carry conversation and the views of the stop are good .",

They had a handful of cocktails on the menu and two I asked about were unavailable because they had run out of the ingredients. I ordered the Tubetti Carbobara which was delicious but came with Penne instead of Tubetti when the sauce would have been much better with the menu listed pasta. When I asked why the pasta was different from the Tubetti I ordered the waitress told me they had run out. I think I should have been told about that beforehand rather than being given a substitute with no warning.  The sandwich ordered by my dining partner was taken from the deli counter at the front of restaurant which was a shame: you want to feel that your food is made fresh at a restaurant, especially when you're paying $18 for a sandwich! The venue is great though, with a bright open space that's refreshing in Vegas. The only pity was when they opened the expansive windows and the noise of the Strip and the smell of smoke from the Casino below started taking over the ambience.",

    "text": "After watching countless T.V Shows with Giada's cooking, along with her prestine hair and perfectly polished makeup (not to mention killer body), I was convinced her food was good for you and probably super tasty. So for my birthday my husband got us reservations to Giada. Even though we had reservatons we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. That was annoying, but not even close to as annoying as our wait staff! After we were seated, they provided us with menus. The waiter then went into his sales pitch about buying the 'all inclusive three course meal for $199. He went on about how you are getting 3 courses and its specialty items that Giada hand selected. I'm like \"woah, an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $199??!!!\" we said no and asked to look over the menu for a minute. Well it didn't end there. Another server came over to attempt to talk us into purchasing the major expensive meal deal. I felt like I was at a car dealership. We said no and then ordered the entree's we wanted instead (which were still at least $40 per entree)... The portion size was barely enough to feed a 4 year old. I couldn't believe it. But the worst part was the flavor. There wasn't any! I had been salivating at the  mouth just thinking about trying one of Giada's dishes. And this is what I get? I could have literally had a better meal at wolf gang pucks! What a let down. Then for my birthday they offered a special dessert for free. I literally starting laughing when it arrived. It was a small butter cookie the size of a half dollar. Gee, thanks Giada.",

I had made reservations in advance for 11 am on a Sunday morning and was told that it would be breakfast time when i arrived. Not wanting to waste any time i looked up in advanced what i had wanted to order online. My friend & I ended up arriving 30 mins late due to the rain and having a very hard time finding the parking structure to the Cromwell hotel. Needless to say, we didn't make breakfast & it was already lunch time when we had arrived. We had to take the long way thru the flamingo hotel, and it was a bit of a pain in the ass.  Anyways! We were seated right away and i loved how cute the hostesses dresses were. it was very \"giada\" like. The service was def up to par, the managers checked up on us three times asking if we needed anything and if the entrees were delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable and very patient with us, while we decided what to order. We didn't order her recommendations but what we got were delicious! The complimentary flat bread and pesto was AMAZING. So fresh & delicious. I ordered the Arugula salad with pancetta, candied lemon peels, and freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. I thru on an order of the shrimp and got two HUGE shrimps. the salad was one of the best salads i have ever had. It was very simple but tasted SO good. I do think however, it needed some kind of crunch.. maybe some walnuts or pecans perhaps. I also ordered a vanilla tea which was also good but was rather on the cold side. my friend ordered a pepperoni pizza which she enjoyed but it wasn't necessarily amazing... I wasn't really feeling the decor on the inside but the outside of the restaurant looked nice. Towards the end when we got our bill... it was around 50 dollars, which i thought to be pretty cheap.. but then again i paid 22 dollars for salad.. Lol.  All in all I will be back in August to try dinner!! (:",

After a warm welcome and we were shown to our table overlooking the strip and a view of the mountains which was a beautiful setting. Beautifully appointed restaurant. Fred was our main guide through the meal along with Joshua, serving. Prefect service!!   We started with an array of appetizers. Orzo meatballs, bresaola, arugula salad, chicken Marsala meatballs. Good portion sizes. VMain courses included the petit fillet, the Mediterranean white fish call branzino and mine, mine was the risotto with crab, scallops and asparagus. Perfect. We all split the dessert...thanks Diego for convincing us we should indulge. A dark chocolate amaretto something. Wow, don't let the small size fool you, its richness was easily enough for 3 people to share. Bene! A+ food, A+ service. Also, thank you Scott for stopping by to see how are meal was.   Everything was fresh, house made including the pastas, bread and more  Recommendations: make your reservation well in advance. Consider dining earlier in the evening as its a bit more quiet. You could wear casual, but hey, dress up. This is a elegant restaurant.   I will certain be back to enjoy their many choices and a real taste of Italy.  Mille grazie!",

    "text": "One would think for a celebrity chef, the food would be incredible. I am telling you it was a huge disappointment and not worth the price.  We ordered two salads and 2 pastas to share with our party. The pasta sauces lacked flavor of any kind. It needed some salt, fat, pepper, herbs, and spices. It just tasted like mushed veggies. The salads were delicious, though. Crisp greens and perfect amount of dressing. You don't really come to an Italian restaurant for the salads though so the disappointing pastas really were just a huge let down for the entire experience.   Our server, Tim, was incredible. He was very personable, professional, and attentive. I commend him for all of his hard work for our party. As for the bartender, I didn't get his name, he could really use a lesson in personality. He was so dull and seemed inconvenienced I wanted a separate check from my manager for our two cocktails. La Strada was an incredible cocktail regardless.   This place has a lot of potential with a great location, view, and ambiance but needs to work on their recipes to really invoke Italian flavors and iconic dishes.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Giada's.  She's one of my favorite Food Network celebrity chefs.  I've met her twice and own Giada autographed cookbooks.  She's also a UCLA Bruin which is pretty cool.  When I found out that I'd be in town for a family event, I booked a reservation at Giada on our free night via Open Table.  I had to adjust the reservation slightly when we booked a show on the same evening which wasn't a problem.  We arrived at the Cromwell and the valet asked if we were dining at Giada which we indeed were.  He even offered to give us directions to the restaurant.  It was pretty easy to follow the path and signs within the Cromwell.    Our reservation was at 5:30 pm and we arrived at 5:15 so we took advantage of the free photo booth and took some pictures.  There's an option to print them right there, send via email or post on Facebook.  We opted for the print and received 2 copies.  After the photos, we sat and waited until they were ready to take us into the restaurant.  There were a few parties ahead of us who arrived at the time of their reservation and they were seated before us, no big deal.  I did notice that all of the hostesses seemed to be wearing very short LBDs.  No judgement as it is Vegas, but according to my boyfriend, my LBD was modest compared to theirs.  We were escorted past the big window and seated against a wall.  It would have been nice to have been seated by the window but I could see the view just fine from my seat and the bright lights of the Bellagio signage.  Our waiter was fantastic and he brought an iPad for us to peruse the different types of antipasti, cocktails, wines, and beers they offer, while he went to get us some water.  We opted for two of the film inspired signature cocktails ($15): Serpico and Barbarella.  Of the two, the Serpico was my favorite with the smooth bourbon and the fun ice sphere with a \"G\" inside of it.  The Barbarella was fruity but not too sweet and gin based.  It was also made with ginger beer so it was like a Moscow mule but with gin.     For our meal, we decided on the spinach & buffalo ricotta pizzette with roasted garlic puree & porchetta ($14), mustard crusted rack of lamb served with braised beluga lentils, roasted rainbow cauliflower & vincotto ($51) and the Barolo braised Australian wagyu beef short rib served with soft polenta and garden vegetables ($52).  They brought out a spectacular complimentary bread tray.  It came with parmesan bread sticks, cheesy flat crisps, rosemary garlic roll along with lemon butter and pesto sauce.  Can I just say that Oprah's \"I have bread everyday\" came into my head as I ate this?  Because if I could have this bread tray everyday, I'd be a happy girl.    Our pizzette came out and looked amazing, until we tasted it.  It had an overwhelmingly fishy taste to it.  I had a slice and so did my boyfriend.  I asked him if he tasted the fishiness too and he confirmed my suspicion.  There was nothing on the menu that indicated it was seafood based so we could only assume that they cooked the spinach in the wrong pan.  When our waiter asked how everything was, we asked if the pizzette was supposed to taste fishy.  He immediately offered to take it back and asked if we wanted to replace it.  We felt bad since we had eaten half of it but he assured us that if we didn't like it, he would take it back and take it off the bill.  That was an amazing gesture and I applaud him for his hospitality.  Our entrees arrived shortly after and I have to say, the braised short rib is fork tender, delicious.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked too.  The lentils were savory and had an amazing flavor.  Normally, I'm not a fan of lentils but I was a fan of these.  We were impressed by the meal, ambiance, and service at Giada.  We didn't have time for dessert, but I did take a look at the dessert menu and I would have ordered something chocolate hazelnut.  Buon Appetito!",

    "text": "FYI, our experience here took place in late 2014.  So this review may be pretty useless to everyone, but I am writing it anyways because we had a fabulous time at Giada!!  We were very lucky to have lunch at Giada.  It is highly recommended that you make reservations months ahead of time.  We had no reservations.  My wife called and lo and behold, there was a cancellation.  She said that if we arrived there within 30 minutes, they would have a table for us.  The folks at Giada were True to their word.  We only waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  While we waited, we had fun taking selfies inside their photo booth.  The ambiance of Giada is exquisite and charming.  The view of the Las Vegas Strip from our table was lovely.  The table settings were beautiful and unique.  5 stars for the atmosphere!  Service was excellent.  From the hostesses to the busboy to our waitress, the customer service was polite, efficient, and professional.  5 stars!!  Now to the most important part.  The food was 4 to 5 stars delicious!!  All of the dishes were served tapas style so portions were smaller.  Note that some of the items we had may no longer be offered on their current menu. Here is a quick rundown of what we had:  Birdie was a refreshing drink with strawberry and basil. Dolce Vita was another very refreshing drink.   Muffuletta Sandwich is one tasty sandwich. The combination of the porchetta, provolone, and other ingredients was so flavorful! G's Baked Pasta was delish!  Pancetta Egg Pizza was different and yummy! Orzo Meatballs were really good! Chocolate Tiramisu looked beautiful and tasted wonderful too. Cookie Platter had 3 different types of cookies.  All were quite good. Zeppoles are citrus infused italian doughnuts. Hmm...Hmm...good!!!  Based on our very good experience here, Giada rates 5 stars from me!!  Thanks for a wonderful and memorable time!",

The tables are spaced far enough away from each other that you can easily converse with each other and noise level is very acceptable.   We did not have the dinner tasting menu because the entire table must opt in.  Our salads both arugula and romaine were perfectly dressed and each enough to share.  The grilled octopus was tender and moist...just divine.  The crab and scallop risotto and pasta sampler of all four pastas was perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the Branzino was flaky and moist with perfectly crisp skin. Our table of four split the Tiramisu cheesecake...it was rich and just enough.    The service is efficient without being overbearing.  Nancie our server deserves a shout out for being so pleasant and accommodating...we never felt rushed. We all thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Giada and we look forward to our next visit.   Do not miss the photo booth on your way out...a fun finale.",

Yes the food was great, the view was priceless but what I was mostly impressed about was the service we received.  Turley was our main server but all the other servers were so hands on that it seemed like we had more than one server. Turley was so welcoming and hospitable. As a group of 5 girls, yes we were a bit needy. We asked him like 50 questions then annoyed him to take 50 pictures but he was super nice and answered everything very politely and with his knowledge. Turley definitely deserves 5 stars.  *do keep in mind that the Cromwell started charging for valet services*",

Don't forget to use the photo booth by the waiting area!  Filet was perfect, lemon salad was amazing, orzo meatballs were good, desserts were great. View of the Bellagio fountains was awesome.

This practice undermines the value of Yelp!   Just ate there last night and came away very disappointed. Food was okay, but overall experience was bad. Typical celebrity restaurant in Vegas. Giada should upgrade the staff to match the price point.  Hostesses were clueless and chewed gum the whole time. Waiters/others never made eye contact with you and were generally impersonal. Collected our payment before the rest of our expensive  bottle of wine was served to us from the chill bucket located from the table. We had to ask if there was more wine left to pour. Prices VERY HIGH for experience, and we are used to high priced restaurants, so that was not the problem.  We love you Giada and hope you get more involved with this operation.",

We both got the potatoes with our breakfast sandwich and we both loved them.  We spilt the polenta waffle with strawberries and grilled pineapple. It was mouth watering good.

Unfortunately when we came back the second time it was an underwhelming experience  Pastas were either too thick or undercooked; meatballs and my husband's fave bacon-wrapped dates were only so warm and did not taste as great as we had them before, for some reasons. The seven of us couldn't get a reservation earlier than 9.30 pm that night,  so maybe the quality of the food decreased dramatically around that time?   Our company enjoyed the drinks which were tasty and great. Service was always great although our server had problems with some slow-running tablets that night. We were able to see some parts of the Bellagio's water fountain show from our table, which was a plus.  Not sure if we will be coming back...",

The normal feeling if being at a very nice place to eat. We were seated shortly after we got there. Unfortunately, had to ask someone who was not our waiter for menu's they were not very prompt on greeting us with menus or water.   They did have an interesting addition to the menu called a tasting menu. Had about a 5 course meal to choose from. Too much food for us. But also had some of her recipes included.  We order bubbly wine & a couple of appetizers. A mozzarella cheese ball very moist & full of flavor. Also some bacon wrapped dates with a lil'chilly & blue cheese. Very flavorful.   We all order something different on the menu to try. I had the lobster ravioli, aunt had the spaghetti lemon & her best friend had the risotto with Scallops. All very tasty.   Lastly we had all split a wonderful chocolate tart dessert. Looked like a Reese's peanut butter cup. Had a yummy raspberry sauce drizzled on it with blackberry's & edible gold flakes. Just enough goodness to please the chocolate lovers.   Overall very good experience & great food. Definitely make a reservation. Great view of the strip & Bellagio fountains. Food is not on the cheap side but definitely a good date night.",

Our server was absolutely lovely, knowledgable, attentive but not too much. The food... Oh my the food!  We only had antipasto but it was stunning. The bread was fresh out of the pizza ovens, hot light and just enough salt. We had cheese plates, mushrooms and prosciutto with a delightful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. For desert we had the tower of chocolate and the lemon souffle- outstanding. A little pricey, but worth every penny.",

Boyfriend enjoyed this drink   Raspberry nectar agave iced tea: omg cutest and fanciest presentation ever! MUST GET THIS! The nectar liquid sugar was so good!!!  Bread: presentation was so cute and so Giada! Loved the lemon butter mm. Mix it with pesto! Yummy  Orzo meatballs: so so soft! Came with 5 - they were tiny but a good appetizer! Delicious!   Lemon spaghetti with shrimp: shrimp was HUGE! Literally the size of a baby lobster. So crunchy and so succulent! Don't be fooled by the \"lemon\" because it was pretty salty! But balanced perfectly with the shrimp. Spaghetti cooked PERFECTLY!  Lobster ravioli: there was a tarragon flavor which I was not a fan of! Flavor was just really citrus-y and not what I expected at all. Skip this dish!",

It was our first time there and I can say it was a good experience,  the food was pretty good,  more in the gourmet side than the traditional Italian,  but was ok. Service was very good, Nancy gave us very good suggestions. The only downside is that if anybody in the table wants to order the fixed menue, then everybody in the table have to order it too, which doesn't always work when you have a person (elderly ) in your party that doesn't eat much, then a four course dinner ends to be a waste. Other high end restaurant that we go to, let's you order the fixed menu and also A la Carte.",

The only tasty selection was the deviled eggs. My friend, who was reason we went to Giada's in the first place, was really disappointed in the rest of the antipasti selection. I ordered the Baked Sausage & Eggplant Lasagna as my main entree. Considering Giada is italian, I expected her to have her pastas down, but I was also disappointment as this was a $29 plate.   I got to taste my friend's entree, the Italian Chicken & Waffles with Cacciatore Sauce which was pretty good in comparison every thing else we had tasted. The cacciatore sauce was delicious, and the waffles had great texture.   Giada's dining area is beautiful, but we were really expecting to enjoy more than just the ambiance, and a bite of egg and a sauce side considering a $130 meal for two.",

    "text": "I'm generously giving Giada 3 stars, but only because of the service. My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday, and the waiter was very courteous and exactly the kind of waiter I want to always have in all my dining experiences. He appeared to be legitimately Italian based on his accent, which definitely added to the experience.   I'll admit that I was the one who wanted to come here on our brief weekend trip to Vegas, and my boyfriend was a good sport about it. I love Giada's show, and I thought to myself, what's better than actually getting to sample the food she cooks on TV? Obviously, Giada herself does not prepare the food, but it's still her restaurant, so I assume the chefs use her recipes. Unfortunately, Giada was not at the restaurant, as some other diners have posted. Granted, I wasn't really expecting her to be there either.   I had a reservation, but my boyfriend wanted a window table, so we requested it. We ended up waiting an additional 25 minutes for a booth that faced the window, but not what we had expected for such a long additional wait. Had I known, I would have just told them to forget it.  Onto the food...  They give you a variety of complimentary bread with several accompaniments, which I really enjoyed. But you don't need to give me an excuse to enjoy some free bread. I love my carbs. We had the Crab Salad Crostini to start with, and it was good for what it was. For my entree, I ordered the Pappardelle, which I had high hopes for - maybe too high. The pasta itself was good. It was the pork ragout that sits atop it that disappointed. It was WAYYYYY too salty. I was downing water after every bite. I ate all the pasta, but left the ragout for my boyfriend, since his meal was a bit paltry in terms of portion size. He ordered the Three Cheese Tortellini and really liked it - except for the fact that it probably had less than 10 dime-sized pieces of actual tortellini in there.  We opted to skip dessert, since we had plans elsewhere for that. However, our waiter brought my boyfriend two small cookies for his birthday dessert, which was really nice of him to do. They were average, taste-wise. I make better cookies that that, and they're my least favorite thing to bake. I guess, you could say the food was average or below. It's unlikely I'll return on any future visits to Vegas.  Overall: 3.5/5 Food: 1.5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5",

I made reservations and unfortunately our table was not ready when we got there and we had to wait about half an hour. We were seated at a lovely table and I really enjoyed the details of the place like the knives the lay upward. Unfortunately when it came to the food I was a little disappointed. The food was good but it wasn't excellent until I got to my main course. Even my Roman caprese salad got mixed in with a few pieces of mint that definitely shouldn't be have been there. (They did apologize and removed it from the bill)  The Branzino was great! It had a wonderful puree with it and was definitely worth it. Everything else was just average. I'm not sure I'd go back.",

My coffee and water were constantly topped off, which I personally use as a gauge for service at restaurants (I drink a lot of water). They even provided a side of blueberries though it didn't come with the Waffles.   The food was good but nothing spectacular. Waffle had a pleasant crunch to it but fell flat in terms of flavor. Keep in mind, I tend to be more of a pancake lover. I tried one of my eating companion's lemon garlic potatoes and they were a solid accompaniment to his meal, but again nothing to write home to mom about.   Overall, I recommend this place for a good meal with excellent service.",

My friend and I came here during our stay on Christmas weekend. We called ahead to see if we needed reservations and unfortunately, the main dining area was all booked up. Sad face! But the kind woman on the phone let us know we were more than welcome to dine in the lounge/bar area where they served a full menu. Sure, why not??  When we arrived, I was impressed with the decor and setup of the place. It's very chic and glamorous but inviting and comfortable at the same time. It didn't feel stuffy at all which was great! I always hate going to a nice restaurant and feel like I'm being sized up...  On to the FOOD!  My friend and I definitely ordered way too much food but whatever, it's Christmas! lol  CHICKEN MARSALA MEATBALLS: This was delicious and it also came with wild mushrooms... And I really LOVE mushrooms. Only bad part was when we finished it and left me wanting more!  CHARRED OCTOPUS: The most tender octopus I've ever had in my life! Definitely a must try!  BRUSSEL SPROUTS ON CROSTINI: This was probably the only thing that wasn't as good as everything else but it was still delicious! Just that everything else stole the show....  BRAISED AUSTRALIAN WAGYU SHORT RIB: This was the only main dish we ordered and shared. The meat literally melted in my mouth it was SOOOOO GOOD! Definitely suggest getting this!!  We ended up not being able to finish everything and had to take a nap after from food coma....Great food, naps, and alcohol. This was the BEST Vegas trip I've ever had LOL",

The octopus was soft and tasted good.   My husband got the rib eye. It was cooked well but he said the steak was ruined because of the arugula salad on top which had a tart vinaigrette on it and it got on the steak.  The lobster ravioli was soft and had good pieces of lobster in it but not very memorable.   The rack of lamb is not a rack because there are only 2 pieces served (4 ribs). The mustard crust was too strong for my taste and after scraping it off, the lamb tasted better. It was cooked well, but also not memorable.   The dessert was probably the best part of the meal.  Yummy gelato flavors.   Overall food was average and seriously overpriced for the quality and taste.",

We ordered Antipasta and main courses and they simply did not WOW us. The wine list was not very good for reds.    Service was not great at all - waited extensively after each interaction.    I do not recommend this place - go to Prime, Mortons or Lavo instead and you will be much happier.",

Because I rather spend that money somewhere else.  Place is nice and bright. Premiere real estate as you can sit near the window overlooking the strip if you have a small party.  Don't get me wrong. Food is excellent and fresh. But ridiculously overpriced. 5 Costco Sized meatball costing $14. No thanks.  ice cream and gelato is the best I ever had. So good and rich.  Lobster roll was good but $35. Way too overpriced but note no mayo which still taste amazing.  I had a Carbonara pizza which was good and the sunny side up egg is eye appleasing. Also had lemon grilled cheese with prosciutto.  Pesto sauce that came with baked pizza bread is out of this world. So good that we asked to pack home the sauce.  Only disappointing plate we has was the baked lasagna. Nothing special. Very small portion by the way.  Was kinds bummed with limited menu for lunch, but we still ordered lots of food.

Restaurant is located on upper level of the Cromwell Hotel with convenient access to escalator/stairs. Hostess acknowledged us right away and showed us our way to the bar area. There were lounge chairs and tables set up with \"reserved\" notes on tables so when we acquired to sit there they promptly said no due to reservations (we were there for about an hour and not one table was being occupied with a \"reservation\"). We were greeted by Giovanni and WOW so phony! Every question we asked his answers were so fake! It was to the point you didn't even want to talk to him. Our party of 4 ordered the Antipasti and incredible!!! Every piece of cheese/meat was better than the next. If I am back in town another visit would be happening but maybe a call ahead to make sure Giovanni is off.",

I enjoyed talking to him. He takes pride in his job. I will definitely be back to eat here whenever I'm in Vegas (which is ver often). Also, there's a photo booth in the entrance of the restaurant. It was great to take pictures there and they are free of charge. Keep up the great work !!",

My family and co-workers enjoyed a spectacular dinner. Three of us had the Barolo Braised Australian Wagyu Beef Short Rib, one Veal Chop Saltimbocca and Pappardelle. I initially wanted the AU Short Rib since I was just in Australia and two employees recommend it. The dish was fantastic. It melted in your mouth.

However my dish was wrong then the server pressured me to keep the dish I hadn't ordered insisting it was delicious, which I had no doubt but I wanted the dish I ordered. So they took it back, we waited 10 min for the corrected dish while my husbands sat under the heat lamp. Then the bill came out wrong twice. It felt like we were there forever by the time we left we were the second to last customers! So many other great restaurants In Vegas, I won't be recommending,",

Art on the walls is cool - I'm told it's mostly stuff related to her grandpa.  We had reservations, but still had a bit of a wait before being seated so we had some drinks in the lounge area. The menu is on an ipad which is probably not necessary but would be cool if you could order from it or it offered anything a printed menu couldn't.  After we were pretty much done with our first round of drinks in the lounge were seated by a big poster of Barbarella and given the rundown of the menu and whatnot. Prices were a bit high but we took this opportunity to not care a ton about cost and just ordered what we thought would be a satisfying amount of food. We all ordered and somewhat shared our food. I had lemon potatoes, charred octopus, and pappardelle pasta. All of it was pretty good and I didn't leave hungry or too full. Food was prepared well and the octopus was one of the better I've had.  What I really liked were the drinks. The Destroyer and Serpico were pretttty delicious and not something I could just go order anywhere I don't think. If I'm ever back to Vegas I would go back here solely for the cocktails.  Everyone had a good time, nothing was crappy, all in all a success - just sort of spendy, so know that's what you're getting yourself into here.",

The pasta and sauce had no flavor, the shrimp was decent but nothing special, portion was acceptable but not worth $34. My husband had the Short Rib Agnolotti which he said was Ok in taste but again nothing special. His portion looked like an appetizer for 2 and definitely not worth $28. I get that Las Vegas tends to be on the expensive side but some places actually have tasty food and price is not an issue; here the food does not live up to the hype. As for the restaurant itself it is very clean and nice looking but our waiter was a little slow and somewhat inattentive. I love Italian and actually make a few of Giada's dishes at home but this was a total let down. In fact the other 3 people with us agreed they would not come back.",

There were parts of the tasting menu that I wouldn't otherwise order but every part was super yummy!!! Stephanie was pleasant & also very very attentive. I had the chicken & waffles and was pleasantly surprised by how light yet juicy/crunchy the chicken/skin were. The waffles were a fresh perspective...since I normally find most waffles bland these were a nice change...& the cacciatori had multiple levels of flavor.... for dessert I had the Lemoncillo Souffle...which was to die for (perhaps consider using the Raspberry gelato from the cookie dessert for more depth?) And the raspberry lemon cookies were also good! All in all a wonderful meal and would definitely come back. :)",

When the same rude hostess that I talked to when we arrived came to take us to our table she saw my fiance's purse had a handle that looks like brass knuckles and she said to my fiance \"Good idea, you never know these days\"just out of ear shot for me. After that we went to our table where we had a very rude French server who talked down to us as much as possible. We ordered calamari and crab appetizers and I couldn't believe how salty the calamari was. I could barely eat what I did eat. I ordered the salmon and he said I should try the red snapper and if I didn't like it I could get the salmon instead. When he it finally came out it was hard and over cooked and just as salty as the calamari . He came by and I told him I didn't like it and he sighed and took it away and brought the salmon. It was also hard on top but the rest was edible. The deserts weren't any better and when the rude waiter asked if we wanted coffee or espresso we said no and he just turned his nose up and walked away. I will NEVER go there again and I highly encourage you all to do the same.",

I guess the restaurant just recently started serving lunch and so service was a little off in that there was quite a lag and confusion with the seating, and our server during the start of the meal was quite confused as he was bringing our food to the wrong table twice! But all was well since our main waiter and his other 'assistant' were pretty attentive. Our main waiter also gave us very good descriptions of the menu items and excellent recommendations for cocktails and entrees. The food was nothing short of excellent!  We started out with orzo meatballs, the caponata along with the complimentary focaccia with the side of pesto for our antipasti. They were all well prepared with each dish having the right balance of seasonings. I had the lobster roll with the lemon aioli topped with fried capers and a side of arugula salad. The lobster meat was moist and crisp, cooked just right and the lemon aioli with the fried capers rounded out the flavor of the seafood. My friends ordered the tenderloin sliders and the Venetian turkey panino; and although I didn't try their dishes they both had good things to say about the dishes. It was served with a side of zucchini 'scapecce', which was a dish made out of very thin strips (strings, if you will) of zucchini which was deep fried to perfection and very well seasoned.  I would have given this restaurant a perfect 5 stars, if it weren't for the service which probably could improve in time with just a bit more organization.",

    "text": "Arrived Saturday afternoon about 3 pm for a late lunch with my daughter. The hostess explained the restaurant was closed until 5. She also said they were overbooked and could not make a reservation. I asked if I arrive at 5pm what the likelihood of securing a table would be. The hostess insisted we would not be able to be seated until 8pm as they had a cancelation. My daughter and I sat in lobby of the restaurant trying to figure out an alternative place to dine. A gentleman that appeared to be a manager approached the host stand. I approached and shared my dilemma that we did not have a reservation. The manager introduced himself, George and said to please dine in the lounge and he would move us to a table if possible. George came through and we were seated in Valentino's section. (Not sure why the hostess didn't explain dining in the lounge was an option.) We were the first guest in the lounge and shortly before 5 the lounge was becoming pretty crowded. I was disappointed in the lounge service as we were the first ones to sit and the last ones to be acknowledged with menus or beverage offerings. It seemed the lunge needed more than one server at 5pm. After a glass of wine in the lounge a table opened in Valentino's section. Valentino and the experience he created not to mention the food is the reason for the 5 stars. The service with the hostess and lounge server did not meet my expectations. Valentino turned all that around as he took us on a culinary journey exploring the menu. He was genuine in his recommendations and menu knowledge. The selections we ordered were perfectly prepared. We will be back. Small plate Orzo meatballs, cheese plate and pasta dishes were perfection. Thank you Valentino for the lovely night and thank you George for suggesting we start in the lounge.",

    "text": "I had made a reservation through my hotel only to find out when I arrived that the Sunday I thought was booked was actually 2 weeks later!  This was by no means the fault of Giada's, rather my hotel but when I explained to the hostess what had happened, she was very understanding and empathetic and did her best to at least get us in for a look and quick tasting! I was highly motivated to visit primarily because my 3 daughters, 6 year old twins and a 7 year old, have gotten me hooked on Giadas show.  They are avid fan and with all the great places to eat in Vegas, it had special meaning to experience it for them.   While I only had time to enjoy a mixed appetizer plate and dessert, I found both to be exquisitely presented in a wonderfully enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere which certainly captured California casual with an elegant Italian experience. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, all of the food was amazingly tasteful and light while certainly satisfying.  We also tried 4 of the deserts, each wonderful and I dont think we could have gone wrong with any of the choices. I would like to add that while Giadas entire experience was enjoyable, there are plenty of wonderful restaurants happy to take your money.  What was truly as notable as the food however were the people and especially, the Manager, Avi.  Even as busy as this newly opened place is, he made it his personal mission to great every guest and sincerely wanted to insure we had a wonderful experience, even though we werent really \"officially\" there for the entire course.  A final thank you also to Avi in that after I had explained the details of our visit and evening, he personally insured I had a great story, and more, to share with my daughters.  Now really, who does that any more?! Thank you Avi and Giada's.  I look forward to returning soon and staying for the entire experience.",

Did not love the iPad. I was more comfortable with the Menu. The iPad was kinda confusing.  Next time I will totally skip the iPad and ask for the menu. Thank you Joseph for helping us with the menu.",

Everyone ordered something different and everybody was happy.  We ended up tasting off each other's plates, and were not disappointed.  The celebrity aspect of the restaurant is nice, but the food is the real deal.  The atmosphere was elegant and felt more like a beautiful home than a commercial establishment.  The service was outstanding.  If you can, book a table with a view of the fountains.  Love this restaurant!!!",

The risotto with crab and scallops is good. Service is 5 stars, and the restaurant is quite new looking, good window view. Do not know about the desserts because we were too full to order, but the coffee is pretty good. Ah, the drinks and food came very quickly, so if you are in a hurry, you will get going pretty fast. We had dinner the night before at another Italian restaurant in Caesars, this restaurant is much better, and has better service. So if you like her show, this is the only restaurant she openned. Yes, go for it!",

Plenty of space between tables and the decor was modern but inviting. Kind of a mixed bag here as far as food.  We ordered the orzo meatballs on some Yelpers recommendation and they were served pretty cool. They might have been good but really too chilly to say for sure. Also had the salami and cheese antipasto plate and most of that selection was very good to outstanding. The parm was great!!    I ordered the risotto with crab and scallops. While tasty, not the level I expected from a high end celebrity chef venue in Las Vegas  My wife had the wago short ribs that she found .....just OK. The polenta it was served on was quite good however. Service was again. Just OK.  We ordered wine before ordering anything else and it came well after the meatballs arrived.   There was afore mentioned meatball issue and I had to chase a little for a check. Not bad service...Just not high level   Overall three stars just about says it and for $275 tip in for a couple I had expected a LOT more as to the quality of the food and service.  Lots of choices on the strip at this price point.  I'd choose others.",

    "text": "As other reviewers have noted, the restaurant is simply lovely inside: elegant and relaxed with a view of the strip that wraps the restaurant in light.   It is unpretentious and warm.  I found myself transfixed by the halo light fixtures.  The female staff needs a lesson on how to speak in their \"grown-up\" voices...I was scolded by a woman-child for bringing my seltzer-water (purchased at the bar downstairs moments earlier) into the restaurant.  Fine point, but the delivery was needlessly condescending in advance of the $600 our party was about to spend on dinner.  #tiredofbabytalkokay?  I am not fan of iPads at the table... there's something decidedly unappealing about touching something that thousands of slot-machine fingers have perused and then joining hands in the communal bread basket that violates what little I know about food safety and sanitation.   Were the 6 of us to pretend that the iPad is sterile?  Or perhaps ritual hand washing en masse?  The Antipasti course is how, we are to believe, Giada eats at home:  a little bit of everything but not too much of any one thing.  Our group shared two types of meatballs, a teeny  pizza, octopus, stuffed peppers and goat cheese crostini.  Each was delightful, if ordinary but for the octopus which I dreamt about.  My BF and I shared the table-side chicken, or as I like to call it, Giada's Bait and Switch.  The ideas is that this is a small roasted chicken brought table-side and then the chicken is returned to the kitchen for carving and the vegetables are made into a family recipe cacciatore sauce.  What came to the table initially looked luscious and fresh before it was whisked away by our server.  What came BACK to the table were bits of fried chicken parts, drizzled in a red sauce that was made at 11:00 that morning.  It was too expensive to be funny.  Amusing maybe...  Dessert is also served table-side from a cart an idea that sounds better than the execution- temperatures of the desserts are uneven depending on how long they've been on the cart.  The lemon cookie was perfect.  Peanut Butter Tiramisu was fun but at room temperature, the texture was off.  Coffee service should be more efficeint- they are oddly out of their depth on something that should be rote.",

We decided to try the stuffed peppers and the grilled Octopus for starters and The Chicken Cacciatore for two , with a side of broccolini. The Peppers were amazing and perfectly charred. The Octopus was good , not spectacular (its hard to find this done perfectly) The chicken cacciatore was DELICIOUS! it was done fried with a sauce on the side...together it was just so good. Broccolini was a perfect side...cooked nicely and seasoned well. The breakfast was also done very well. We had TWO VERY good meals here and will be back again!!",

    "text": "I visited Giada at the newly renovated Cromwell for the first time a couple of days ago, and I'm left confused about how to describe this place, but here are the first ten words that come to mind:  Delicious. Complicated. Beautiful. Unique. Annoying. Surprising. Pretentious. Well-intentioned. Pricy. Enjoyable.  Is this list schizophrenic? That might be appropriate, because dining here is a wildly multi-sensory, potentially annoying, but delicious experience.  FOOD For me, a restaurant is about many things but primarily the food. In this area, Giada is superb. The complicated menus -- plural -- are large, but once we got through them every single bite was delicious. Nothing was merely average. Everything was scrumptious.  My table of four ordered enough for a small country -- in part based on a dubious suggestion from our server that the dishes are intentionally small; I'm familiar with small-plates concepts, so we followed his lead and ordered the following from two of the three menus to share. From the sampler menu, which is presented via iPad with sampler \"packages\", we ordered the option with bacon wrapped dates, a pea pesto crostini, calimari, stuffed baby sweet peppers, mushrooms, and potentially several other things I can't remember. Everything was stellar. I suggest you wear a diaper, because the bacon-wrapped dates may make you wet yourself.  From the main printed menu, we shared a wild mushroom pizette, spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, risotto with crab and scallops, branzino with tangerine vinaigrette, veal saltimbocca, and lemon potatoes.  First, all of the above were crazy delicious. I would taste something and think, \"This is the best.\" Then I tasted the next item and thought, \"Oh, this is the best.\" And so on. In the end, the veal saltimbocca was probably the standout for me.  Second, I would not classify these as small plates. I'm a fatty, and I would have been satisfied with one pasta OR one main, not the pasta AND main as suggested. We over ordered, which drove the bill up.  I can't help but think the servers are simply trained to sell, sell, sell. It's a smart business move -- just perhaps not in the best interest of the patron. My suggestion if you go to Giada: by all means over order to sample everything if money isn't an issue, because it is delicious. However, do not feel you need to. You'll be satisfied with one pasta or one main if you share a couple appetizers.  Common threads through everything we tasted were lemon...and complication. For example, we ordered iced tea -- and even that's complicated. It's brewed at your table for one cup, so no refills. At Giada, if you order x, they'll do x, but it's a production to do x.  (By the way, the three variety bread course served was yummy and is served with an option of wonderful spreads.)  MENUS I've already mentioned two of the menus we received. The third menu was the tasting menu with no price listed. We asked: it was $110 per person. For that you receive pre-selected favorite items, an autographed picture of Giada de Laurentiis, and the recipes for the items you ate, in a souvenir folder.  Really? I understand that Giada is a celebrity chef. I personally find her delightful, but the autographed picture offer seemed like a narcissistic gimmick. Her food speaks for itself. (And eloquently.)  We did not order dessert, but the dessert tray is huge -- literally. There were about 20 to choose from on a behemoth cart.  SERVICE This was my biggest issue at Giada. Everyone was well-intentioned and friendly but overly trained and zealous -- so much so that my party felt it oppressive. Throughout the dining room, servers stood at attention as if in the military, waiting to \"help\" but actually hovering. They wanted to engage after every dish for feedback, and it was just a bit much. The restaurant is new, so perhaps management will tame this with time.  ATMOSPHERE Where to begin? The restaurant is beautiful, and again, complicated. I counted about eight different seating styles/chairs/lounges/table types/environments on various levels. The art is colorful and plentiful, and the lighting is fun and fascinating. One would think throwing all of this together would be bombastic. In a way it is, but it also works. The windows open for a wonderful, open air feel -- complete with noisy traffic and strip noise (which I found charming) and incredible view of the Bellagio water show. If you're a small party, request a seat near the open air windows.  There's also a photo booth near check-in. This is a playful, very nice touch. Your seating hostess will also offer you a tour before you're seated if interested. She was hard to hear among the noise, but it's another unique touch.  NUTSHELL Despite the high price tag, I would have rated Giada 5 stars had it not been for the borderline-intrusive service. Go...but bring your wallet. Bring your appetite. And bring your patience. You'll need all to fully enjoy the delicious schizophrenia.",

    "text": "Finally Chef Giada has opened her first restaurant and it's the at the center of the Las Vegas strip! Now everyone can enjoy her comfort Italian food instead of just watching her cook the dishes on tv. I went to this fine establishment for Sunday brunch and it was delightful.  They had a breakfast and lunch menu which included a carbonara pizza with a sunny side up egg, light and fluffy French toast along with chicken Marsala meatballs and an assortment of salami.  We also had her classic lasagna. The meal is definitely not complete without her famous lemon ricotta cookies. The service was also amazing and the manager came by to check how we were doing and gave us her personal business card. Autographed cookbooks are available as well.  This is not a dig at the restaurant but a complaint about the Cromwell hotel. The hotel does not have a single changing table for changing infants. Gone are the old days of not being family friendly in Vegas. Please comply with current societal standards as yes babies do eat out with their parents!",

I've heard many compare here with others on the strip, but I really think you have to take it as its own restaurant.

There is no dish or plate that you'll be talking about, and the value for the food is minimal at best.  The service is an A+ here, and you will feel like Giada took the time to put a good presentation together at this restaurant.  It's elegantly modern, from the menus to the decor.  But it's super plain.  She took no risks, and lacked any creativity here.  The food is very good, but you will have to significantly over order on expensive dishes to leave with a full stomach.  If you're seeing a show after you eat, be sure to splurge on several appetizers, because you will indeed be hungry.  Good: Cheese Antipasti; Lobster Ravioli; Tortellini; Veal Chop  Not So Good: Orzo Meatballs; Porterhouse; Any of the plain, thoughtless side dishes; Emphasis on expensive",

I've watched her on the Food Network for over 7 years, bought her cooking books, and watched her empire grow. I was so excited to try her restaurant.   The service was excellent!   The food was delicious but extremely rich. My sister and my mother got sick.  Maybe, if you only take a bite, like how Giada eats, then maybe you won't get sick.   The Meat and Cheese Board is to die for! It's a must have to start.   The Shrimp was incredible in one of her famous dishes, The Spaghetti (Shrimp, Lemon, & Basil). However, the sauce was way too much, it was too buttery, creamy, cheesy. What ever happened to a little olive oil and lemon? This was way to rich and took away from the flavor of shrimp. Sometimes, the simpler the better.    Do not get the Rigatoni (Vegetable Bolognese) I think this is the dish that ultimately got my sister sick. I took one bite and it was whatever.  The Cookies were Spectacular.  Maybe my expectations were too high.",

    "text": "Dang, I want to give this place four stars, but I can't.  The food is just too good.  Why four?  My wife and I had a reservation for 8:45 this past Saturday for our 11th anniversary.  We arrived early, at about 8:20.  We ended up waiting until 9:25 to be seated.  No huge deal, but the female front of house manager came up to us at about 9:10 and said she would comp our first round of drinks.  It never happened.  It also took us about 15 minutes to get our first drinks once seated.  I get it, it's new and it was Saturday night.    As for the food?  Crazy.  Crazy good.  it made me forget about the rough start immediately.  We had four courses, each as good as the other.  We started with an Salami dish that came with pickled cherries, apricot, and two kinds of mustard.  Sounds odd, but you roll them all up into one bite and you understand why they make it.  I was shocked how well they balanced each other out.    Second we had chicken marsala meatballs with roasted wild mushrooms.  I thought I knew what marsala was supposed to taste like...nope.  This was far better than any meatball and sauce I have ever had.  How did they make chicken meatballs taste that good???  Third we had pasta (bucatini calabrian chili pomodoro & fresh ricotta) .  It was just as good, and now I understand why fresh pasta is key.  This dish will finally get me to break down and buy the pasta attachment for my kitchenaid mixer.    The main course we decided on was the whole roasted chicken for two, cacciatore style.  First off, they bring the chicken in a large bowl to you from the kitchen, uncut for your inspection.  They take it back at that point and cut it for you.  This gives you time to wipe the drool up.  The flavor was amazing, and had a smoked paprika rub.  The cacciatore sauce was perfect.    On the side we had crispy polenta with checca sauce.  I have never had polenta, so I did not know what to expect.  I was expecting something close to grits, but this was so much more.  The texture was like silk, and the flavor was mild and tasty.    This meal was worth the wait and the price.",

At first felt isolated but we were very happy with where we sat- good view and was great for our group to have some alone time while still very much being a part of the restaurant. Everyone got a variety of dishes and everyone loved there's. I tried the eggplant Parmesan, lobster ravioli, scallop crab risotto and another tapas dish I can't remember but all were fabulous!! Great service- we had two berth attentive servers. Highly Recommend!",

Giada is located inside the Cromwell Hotel. The restaurant is modern and spacious. With the right seating you can  watch the Bellagio fountains go off. I highly advise you to order family style and don't be afraid to share your  meals with your party. The top food choices to order would be the lemon spaghetti, the lamb, and ribeye.   I think Lauren is the best waitress and I think the only  woman waitstaff. She's super fun and overall a wonderful waiter. Be sure to request her when you  book.   If your in a rush then this restaurant is not for you. If you  want to enjoy a dining experience that does not rush  you then Giada is the place.  Ohh!

Friends had told me they were not impressed and to forgo coming here but I thought they were being foodie snobs and wasn't going to be deterred. Made the earliest dinner reservation and took my husband for his birthday. As we were walking to the table, the pleasant hostess wished him a happy birthday and seated us in what felt like a dark secluded/cramped hallway right up against a wall. Hubby made compensating remarks and didn't want to make a fuss to have us moved.  There was no price on the tasting menu and shame on me for not asking. $140 per person; no drinks. The food was ok; no wow moments. And the pasta was most disappointing; a bit tough. Service was ok; a bit late with water and ice tea refills. Was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine. Got up to leave (my back was to the main dining area) and as I was leaving, saw the beautiful view other reviewers had mentioned. I apologized to my husband for dragging him here for his birthday. He would have preferred a good Steakhouse. Sadly, this is not a place I will recommend to my tourist friends and/or locals.",

We were greeted right away from a very friendly cocktail server in the lounge.   My boyfriend order the giada cocktail and I had their blood orange martini (it had a much better name but I forgot) both were delicious.We ordered the burrata, bacon stuffed dates and the mushroom pizzette! All were to die for. We decided to also order a chocolate orange specialty espresso and my favorite.. Polenta cake! Not to sweet, but absolutely delicious  This restaurant has a great atmosphere and an exceptional attention to detail. From bev naps, to flatware, to all different station (pasta,bread, espresso, antipasto) to the \"G\" carefully crafted in out espresso and cocktails. We were also very impressed as the manager went to every single table in the restaurant to personally introduce himself and shake everyone's hand.

It is a bit on the noisy side, but you really don't need to talk when you have such amazing food in your mouth!",

It's located at The Cromwell hotel on the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd.   My only complaint were the not so friendly hostesses, they sucked! Way to be a buzz kill when trying to enjoy a nice dinner. I will return to try other things on the menu but that's about it.",

From the fresh pasta being made to the decorations, the environment can be a little intoxicating (in a good way)   The food was amazing! We got the cheese, the bucatini, and the veal chop. As well as a bottle of sparkling. The sommelier was great! I can't remember his name off the top of my head, but he was very willing to chat with us about the winery where our wine came from, and spent a good amount of time with us. Our glasses were never empty. Whether it was the server or sommelier, both were very attentive. The desserts were incredible. The ricotta cake was a delightful surprise, and the lemon cookies were addictive.   Our service was top notch. Our server was Rocco. As an italian, he fits in perfectly at Giada. However, his service was absolutely incredible. I highly recommend asking for him if you make a reservation at Giada. I believe service is the key to a great restaurant, and here, Rocco makes this experience and restaurant absolutely amazing.   I highly recommend Giada, and Rocco as your server.",

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and while we waited we were shown to the photo booth to entertain us. We were then promptly sat - waited on a team of servers that were exceptional all the recommendations (bacon wrapped figs, lemon pasta with prawns, prosciutto) was beyond delicious- we just ordered a bunch of items and shared family style to get the most out of the menu- I recommend doing that since so everything's so good. The cocktails were also good, always had drink and water refills, staff was very accommodating, friendly, helpful without feeling like they were pushing expensive dishes. And we had a view of the Bellagio fountains :) best dining experience in Vegas that weekend, and many were good!",

Servers were awesome with great suggestions and made me feel like I was their most important customer that night. Then of course there was the amazing food. The appetizers are so good and so numerous it becomes almost impossible to not want to try at least two or three. Eating a dinner of six to eight of the perfect proportioned appetizers gives you a variety it is hard to match for an Italian meal this side of Boston's North end. And finally the atmosphere is very nice without being pretentious. In short the best selection of Italian food in Vegas with a staff that greatly enhances the surroundings and experience.",

    "text": "What a disappointment! I do not mind spending money for good food no matter the size of the serving, but this place was a joke. I've been to many gourmet restaurants and this place is just and insult to all of them. Not only was the food served at room temperature (which means it was sitting out somewhere because it was not hot), I felt like I was at a tasting eating crappy samples. I came to celebrate my wife's B-day, I called in a reservation and I requested a table by the window to see the Bellagio's fountain show (which many people recommend to see from the restaurant) ,I was told that to guarantee a window table there was a $100 per person minimum drinking requirement, otherwise there might not be one available. I took a chance and did not go with the guaranteed option but got one anyway, and found out that you can't see the fountain show because the view is blocked by the footbridge (and they don't tell you that).  We got the menu, the server was very nice, she explained the menu when we had a question, I order a glass of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  At this point everything is good, within 5 min from ordering we get the appetizers. We got 5 meatballs the size of jaw breakers and 5 bacon warped dates slightly bigger than the meatball. We started eating, then I get my wine glass and they served the \"one\" garlic bread which was the size of a biscuit (which was cold and salty). Not even 10 min go by and we get our entrees, LMAO, I've never seen a serving so small, in any other restaurant this won't even be considered an appetizer. Believe me when I tell you that a Lean Cuisine microwavable has more food than these dishes (and they were at room temperature as well, not hot). I do not mind spending money for good quality food no matter the size of the serving but the quality of this food was no better that a T.G.I. Friday's. I got the bill, looked at my wife and we couldn't stop laughing. We were not in this place for more than 1/2 hour and the whole time it felt that they were focus on getting people in and out quickly. The only reason why I give this place one star is because the waiter was the only pleasant park about the experience.  Giada, I hope you read this because I open this Yelp account just to write this review,  you are robbing people by selling them overpriced below average food. We had high expectations because of who you are but your restaurant was the worse place we ate in Las Vegas.",

Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations! We ordered a variety of different appetizers and entrees and we enjoyed each and every dish! Make sure you save room for dessert! That was the best part ;). The service was definitely on point, the server/runner/busser were all very attentive and my water was full all night!

    "text": "Food is seriously eh. I like Giada on Food Network Star (as I am an avid fan of most food entertainment) but, just like on her personal cooking show, the FOOD is 9 times out of 10, boring food on a fancy plate. You may get one dish here or there that hits but for the most part the plates sound like they might hit, but don't deliver. The ambience and decoration are \"nice+ish\" while it does feel a little like a new Vegas version of the Cheesecake Factory. The entrance is nifty but it definitely dances with cheesy.  I  WILL SAY, the service was awesome. Everyone who helped me was attentive and quick. Real congrats to the staff.  So like I said, the food is ok, but when the restaurant itself has cooking shows of the creator playing on loop, flavor expectations start high. Unfortunately, for this place, taste delivery is low low.",

    "text": "The husband and I have been wanting to eat at Giada's restaurant for a while. We finally dined here for dinner last month for my birthday. In fact, I think I called in the reservation about 3 months before. Not that I needed to that far in advance, but its never bad to plan things early, right? I also requested a table with a good view. Although they said \"we will try as much as possible, but not guaranteed,\" we did end up getting a table facing the Bellagio fountains. Also got a fantastic view of the crazy traffic on Las Vegas Blvd, LOL.   Customer service was excellent. Our server and the staff was very nice, polite and attentive. Drinks were refilled and dirty plates were taken away in a timely manner. So here's the thing: years ago when I did watch Giada's cooking show, I really liked her recipes because they were simple. Few ingredients, preparing didn't look too difficult and of course everything looked so good! When I was browsing the menu, everything looked so complicated. I guess it doesn't help that I'm picky about what I eat, but its never a good sign for me when nothing on the menu really catches my eye. So I ordered probably the most boring thing on the menu: Spaghetti. I know, I know, but it was the only dish that didn't have things that I hated like squash, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, etc.  We started with appetizers. We asked our server what appetizer was popular under the meat category, and he recommended the Bacon Wrapped Dates. Not a fan of dates, but they were stuffed with sausage and wrapped in bacon. Sounded like they were worth a try. I was surprised that I could hardly taste the dates and the sausage did have a kick to it, but they were good. We also ordered the Orzo Meatballs, which were juicy and tasty as well. It also came with a generous amount of sauce.  Now to the main course. I was excited when the food was brought to our table because the presentation was pretty. For my spaghetti, there were two jumbo shrimp on the bottom and a dollop of spaghetti sitting on top of the shrimp. Unfortunately, I didn't like the lemon sauce too much. I was kind of over it after the first few bites, but forced myself to eat it all because this place isn't cheap! Ughh, I'm definitely NOT a fan of sweet spaghetti. It needed butter, or maybe just salt. My husband, on the other hand loved his food! He ordered the Bone-In Tuscan Rib-Eye with truffle flakes. Our server said that occasionally they offer the truffle flakes in the restaurant. I thought it was weird that there was a sunny side up egg on the steak. But then again, I do hate eggs. I know that eggs are used to make a lot of foods and that is fine. I guess I should say that I don't like eggs by itself or eggs that are visible. Anyway, he said that the Rib-Eye was fantastic and one of the best steaks he ever had.   I really wanted to order a Tiramisu for dessert, but our server told us that they only serve it when they have some special \"Tastings Menu.\"  :( Total fail for me, but at least one of us really liked the food here.  Been there, done that, but I probably won't be back. A little disappointing, but oh well, there are many other good eats in Vegas!",

    "text": "Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with my meal here. There were a few standouts, but for the most part the food was just mediocre, especially for the high prices.  The good (yum!): -Bacon wrapped dates ($15) - great appetizer, tons of flavor -Tricolore salad ($17) - perfect combination of ingredients  The bad (mediocre): -Charred octopus ($16) - it was okay but I've also had much better  The ugly (never again!): -Pea pesto crostini ($15) - flavorless! The prosciutto was obviously great quality, but the pea spread was not up to par. Thankfully they give you a little tray of crushed red pepper and sea salt, so this helped a bit -Whole roast chicken for 2 ($58) - DRY!!! I was blown away at how dry this dish was. It came with a tomato sauce but it would have needed to soak in the sauce all day to reduce the dryness of the meat.   I will say the service was wonderful. I read many reviews that stated the waitstaff was pushy with the drinks and tasting menu, but this wasn't the case at all. The restaurant itself is also beautiful. I absolutely love the decor and the perfect view of the strip. The photo booth in the waiting area is also a nice touch. I won't be back, but I'm still glad I checked this place out.",

We went there for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She loves Giada and was so excited to go.  Like another reviewer said, Giada's name and face are EVERYWHERE.  It's nuts.    As for the food, I had the ricotta and honey crostini as an appetizer, which was delicious.  And also $12 for tiny pieces of bread.  For the main dish, I got the vegetable bolognese.  It was tasty, I suppose.  But either the dish, or the Las Vegas tap water they served that tasted like metal, really clouded the dish.  Everything tasted rubbery and gross.  Definitely not worth the money at all.  Our waiter got one of the meals wrong and wasn't very nice about it.  I've been to other high end restaurants before and this one was incredibly disappointing.  I was really excited to go and have some amazing Italian food, but Giada's just fell flat.

I absolutely love her and could not wait to try her food! Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The food was unbelievably incredible. The menu is set up go eat courses, so most dishes are small bites/smaller plates. You would get at least e or 3 fishes per person. They brought a round of complimentary Rosemary Foccacia and cheese crisps to the table. This came with 4 things you could add to the bread - salt, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers and Pesto Aioli. The aioli was the so good. Everyone devoured it and had to ask for more! For an app we ordered the burrata and the lemon and crab arincini. They were both amazing. I didn't really taste crab in the arincini and the lemon was very light. However I would get these again! The burrata was soft and creamy and delicious. I wish it had been served with some bread but it was great on its own. For the \"main\" course I got the spaghetti and my boyfriend got the short rib agnilotti. I am not the biggest shrimp person because it is usually overcooked and flavorless. However, this dish was absolutely amazing. It looked stunning on the plate and tasted better than I could have ever imagined. The agnilotti was OK. The pasta was excellent and the sauce was fantastic but the filling was a little dry but had good flavor. We really wanted to try the Lemon Souffle but we were too stuffed! The only negative I have to say is that our waiter was rather rude. Any time we asked for anything it felt like we were bothering him and he seemed very annoyed with us. He didn't ever come back and ask us how our food was and we had to track him down to order more drinks. A little damper on the experience but the food was amazing and I would go back in a heart beat.",

We had cauliflower and white chocolate soup... it sounded weird but it was delicious. The Brussels sprouts and pancetta side was the star of the meal. Now the entrees- spaghetti with jumbo prawns and the lobster ravioli. I did not like the pasta at all. Tasted doughy and salty. The prawns were very bland.   They brought out our soups before the appetizer which was weird. Then one of our peppers wasn't stuffed with marscapone like stated. We pointed it out and they waitress confirmed it was a mistake. So she brought us more appetizers (prosciutto, cheeses, dates) but that just made us so full we didn't want to even eat our mediocre entrees.   I don't mind paying for a good meal but this wasn't worth it. I have had boxed pasta that tasted better.",

    "text": "Decided to try Giada with my friends for lunch because a couple of us are fans (binge watched a marathon of her when I was sick for a couple of days and fell in love with her recipes).  The restaurant definitely doesn't disappoint!  I was skeptical at first because I had heard about the pre-launch troubles the restaurant was having (as well as some disappointing professional reviews immediately after launch), but I clearly didn't have to be.  First of all, the restaurant itself is visually stunning.  Wow!  It's surrounded by windows yet has a very homey feel to it.  Everything was custom for the restaurant (plates, napkins, etc.).  Great view of the strip.  I ended up ordering the arugula and ricotta pizza with pink peppercorns.  Delicious!  Exactly the right composition.  Cooked to perfection, with each of the ingredients standing on its own without overpowering the others.  The table also shared a cheese plate which started off the meal perfectly.  We didn't end up getting dessert, but I probably will when I make it back here.  Would I come back?  Most definitely!",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. I've been a fan of Giada De Laurentiis for years and I was absolutely elated when I read about her new restaurant at The Cromwell. While my review may be laden with all sorts of fan-level biases, I have to also note that I did have VERY high expectations and they were all significantly exceeded.   Unfortunately, our dinner reservations conflicted with another engagement and we were only able to have lunch. If I had more time in Vegas, I would've definitely returned for dinner. The restaurant is so beautiful. It properly emulates Giada's charm and sophistication. While the butter knives were gorgeous, they are heavy and SHARP. If you have young children, make sure you set them aside straight away.  I enjoyed every moment at Giada. The ONLY thing that would've made it better would be to see her there!  Recommendations:  Burrata with balsamic-salt ($12)   Orzo Meatballs with parmesan pomodoro ($14) - My 6-year-old Godson loved these meatballs!  Margherita oven roasted campari tomatoes, mozzerella, basil ($14) - Simple and delicious.  Chocolate Tiramisu  ($8) - I was way too full by the time it came to dessert. Don't get craayyy like I did and save room for this delectable end to a perfect meal!",

    "text": "After having made our reservations 2 months in advance, I was really look forward to finally getting to try Giada's first restaurant. The only thing I was truly worried about was the service expectation. Yelpers have been pretty disappointed with the quality of service they have been receiving when dining.   We arrived about 15 mins before our reservation time. We decided to take advantage of the infamous photo booth, but to our dismay it would not print or email the pictures. We ended up snapping our pics with our iPhones to. (Wish they would've fixed the booth while we dined.)   We were seated in the newest extension of the restaurant. Our server for the night was Joseph. He and his assistant were awesome! We opted to try the tasting menu.   The meal started with the bread platter, which was awesome. The freshly baked foccacia bread was light and fluffy. There were also breadsticks and parmesan crackers. The bread platter was served with pesto oil, chili flakes, australian pink salt, and dried capers for dipping.  First Course: Giada's Appetizer Favorites. We were given bacon wrapped dates, stuffed chili peppers, and crostinis. The dates were definitely my favorite. I'm a sucker for bacon wrapped dates.  Second Course: I opted for the lemon spaghetti, and this is where are awesome server substituted risotto per my husband's request. Both dishes were amazing! The prawns were huge and fresh. Both dishes were full of flavor. I would come back here just for these two dishes.  Third Course: Meat Course: I had the salmon and the husband had the lamb chops. Both were large portions and encrusted with mustard seeds. The lamb chops were cooked medium and very tender. The salmon was nothing special, and seemed like a typical salmon dish.  This course was also accompanied with the house potatoes and corn.  Lastly, Dessert! Bring on the dessert cart. Our kick ass waiter Joseph allowed us to get extra desserts because he was cool like that. Typically, you're allowed to get one dessert per person of your choice off the cart. We had the chocolate amaretto cake, polenta cake, lemon cookie, chocolate chip cookie, and ice cream. The desserts were all to die for. They were not overly rich or too sweet. I have to say tho, the polenta cake was definitely my favorite. The lemon cookie came in second place.  I would definitely come back to eat at Giada's and request Joseph to be our server. He was super friendly and made our evening enjoyable. The best part of the tasting menu is getting a booklet with some of Giada's recipes along with an autographed picture of herself. Giada was in the restaurant that day, but our waiter said she was in the back regulating the line cooks, as orders were being messed up. Hey at least he was honest!  The main reason I can't give this place 5 stars: It was freaking hot in this place. It was as if the air conditioner wasn't working. The poor waiter had to wear a white blazer and you could see all the beads of sweat on the poor guys forehead.",

Did not like:  Wait time to get a menu and water, they brought main dishes before clearing the table, some gaps between courses, and they served one ravioli with the surf and turf.  One small ravioli too....really?  Come on man!  Service:  Overall the serve was good.  Cliff was very nice and helpful with menu and questions.  It just seemed like they were a little busy and it showed a little in the service time.  They made up for that with nice friendliness.  I almost gave them 4 stars...but went with three due to lags in service time.  Food is solid overall, but a tad on the pricey side for what you get.",

I should warn you, I am a Giada fangirl and spent a large part of the evening telling my friends how flawless I find her.  There were seven of us, all very loud and animated.  Immediately upon seating the manager came over to welcome us, thank us for celebrating with them and had the servers bring over a bottle of champagne.    We decided to order a bunch of everything and that is definitely the way to go.  The sausage aranchini was my favorite but we tried all three kinds.  The bread they served was also phenomenal.  And don't miss the clams casino, the white wine sauce in which it was served was to die for.  For the pasta course, Giada's lemon spaghetti is a can't miss.  The crispy capers on top were excellent.  We also tried the tortellini and risotto, both of which were phenomenal.  We also shared the roast chicken and the salmon, the perfect taste, light and balanced.  The absolute highlight was the dessert cart.  Normally only available with the tasting menu, the homemade banana gelato was absolutely incredible.  It tasted like a cold bananas foster and was incredible on the chocolate chip cookie.  The lemon ricotta cookie had an amazing, creamy texture unlike any cookie I've ever had.  And don't miss the photo booth near the hostess stand!  What an adorable touch!!  And the view!  Right on the corner of the Cromwell, you can see the strip.  It was a gorgeous night so they had all of the windows open.  Next time, I'll definitely want a table near the windows.",

We Loved it so that over the last two months we've returned twice to host our friends and show them this great new restaurant.  However each time the shine dulls a bit and last night was our last time  The staff always seem harried and say reservations are running late.  I can understand underestimating once or twice but every time we enter we have to wait at least twenty minutes for our reserved table  Last night the food suffered.  The bar was slow and it took forty minutes for my prosecco to arrive.  The kitchen was slow We had the tasting menu and the waiter didn't realize it came with veggies.  It was on the menu and having been there before we were able to help him.  The main course, was a disaster. It finally arrived and my med well lamb was rare and had to be sent back. My husbands was well cooked but a terrible cut full of fat and the salmon our friend ordered was too salty and inedible   The potatoes that I had raved about were unevenly cut and therefore some were raw still. A shame  It's sad but seems like whoever was managing the staff and maintaining the standard is no longer there. Without consistency there is no longevity and it's too bad that such an inventive menu and great location just cannot cut it",

    "text": "This my first and last review. I do not like to critic a fellow Chef, but I have to speak up when I feel that our art and passion has gone wrong. I will not comment more on the decor or the staff as this is obvious, rather more on culinary side.    My wife wanted to treat me to something special and we went to Giada's. We looked over the menu and ordered something simple, the Calamari Salad, Tricolour Salad, and Margarite Pizzaette, which she and I wanted at the same time to share..    The Calamari Salad came 15 minutes later, in a little cup (did they use an ice cream scoop?). No thought on presentation. The taste was fishy and overcooked rubber bands. 20 minutes, the Tricolour arrived, average looking pile (did they use a funnel to shape it?) The procuitto was buried on the bottom and difficult to eat as they only gave us a fork. Took another 10 minutes to get a knife. The salad was bitter, too bitter, especially since the dates to cut the bitter were missing. Using walnuts sounds good, unless you remember that the skin of walnuts are bitter too. 15 minutes later, we recieved the Pizza, a $11.00- 4 1/2 inch dough ball, that reminded me of my easy bake oven days. Blond and thick, devoid of any pizza I've tried throughout Italy. More like a focaccia with only the center of Cheese and scant Tomato.15 minutes later, the bread display arrives, which much fanfare. The flatbread was too thick and under baked, giving one the impression that it was stale. The baked bread ball with rosemay was decent until you touched the bottom part, which someone salted salted the bottom. Did someone forget that certain fresh herbs amplify salt? What a mouth of sea salt we got as if I dove in the ocean. Luckily, I saved the last swallow of my beer to wash that down.   Culinary training and oversight by the Sous Chefs are VERY needed . Alot of what I had go wrong could have been avoided with by one who is passionate about our craft. No Manager was even seen around, let alone stop by.   AS I said earlier, it was my wife treating me, so her paying for this was hard as she had to work a whole day for our specail date.",

There is a photo booth tucked away to the left of the hostess stand, cute touch. Another hostess came over to escort is to our table. When we entered she pointed out that Giada was next to the antipasti station and asked of we would like to take a photo with her. Sure, why not?! We waited while she was talking to another group and when they were finished our hostess told her we would like to take a picture. She was very abrupt and said that she couldn't have people gathering in the front because it was blocking the entrance. Ok, I get it. But it made us feel like we did something wrong when we didn't even ask to take a photo with her, we thought it was part of the grand opening experience. She said she would come by our table instead, but never did despite visiting many other tables around us. The hostess then gave us a little \"tour \" and lead us to our table. Beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  We ordered the Giada and Flash cocktails, both good, but took forever to come from the bar. The waiter even came by multiple times to tell us they were coming. As for the food, we elected for the tasting menu $120. Probably not the best choice. The antipasti was \"Gilda's Favorites\" and they were just ok. The grilled octopus (dietary substitution) was over cooked. We added the chicken Marsala meatballs, but they never came. The lemon spaghetti was by far the best dish of the night. The pea tortellini was excellent as well. My husband had the lamb and loved it, as well as the corn side dish. I had the salmon and it was ok. No different from any other pan seared salmon at most other restaurants in the strip. The smashed potatoes, were not all that \"smashed\", had good flavor. Again just ok.  Dessert was excellent. PB&J tiramisu (not really anything like a tiramisu though), chocolate chip cookie (served warm), lemon cookie (tart, but a little too sweet), chocolate cake (rich, but delish), and gelato (coffee was the best!). We were supposed to get a signed copy of the tasting menu, but our server forgot to bring it out. We were on our way home before we realized it and my husband had turn around to go back and get it.  I also had the Barbarella and my husband had a glass of wine. In total over $400 for the two of us, and in my opinion not worth it given the other high quality options on the strip. Wait a few weeks and they'll start serving lunch. I'd bet you'd get many of the best dishes at a fraction of the price. Also they will add breakfast/ brunch around Aug.",

The lobster ravioli was excellent, it had a nice summery freshness to it.  The Conan \"The Destroyer\" Cocktail was amazing as well.   (You'll understand the name when you see the cocktail pictured on there iPad cocktail menu).  Our waiter Bryan who was from the Islands and clearly some type of culinary savant, did a superb job.  His knowledge of the food and especially the wine was astonishing.  Definitely a must try restaurant when in Vegas!",

    "text": "Right off the start - we went for lunch.  Maybe that was our problem, but with short stay and long booked reservation list that's all we got.  Starting with the good: There is a very tasteful photo booth in the waiting area.  Big hit withy my kids. The staff is very well trained and extremely open.  They explained all the dishes and showed us around, offered DVD player for the kids and plain were extremely well trained.  Huge kudos for them. We'll laid out space and decor - pink but not overly so. Now for the bad. The food!  Every dish we got except for complementary bread was nothing to write home about.  I always had a suspicion that all the food network chefs in an attempt to outdo each other long forgot that they are cooking food that people would like rather than showcase usually a random or very pricey list of ingredients.  I watched Giada a few times and had the feeling that she's basically adding \"extra sugar to Pepsi\".  IE nothing is really wrong - but what she does kills the taste of any of the underlying ingredients.  Which is exactly what we got for our meal.  I always thought that beauty of Italian food was the freshness and the taste you get with a few very basic ingredients - flour, salt, egg, and water.  And then eggplant, sweet peppers and, say, oregano.  What I got in my baked pasta - was a vat of melted cheese with something resembling about 1/2\" of flat pasta and a few chunks of somewhat undercooked eggplant.  Really?  Good thing Giada still did not discover truffles!  Tuna sandwich was just that - chunks of tuna with a bunch of stuff.  My daughter's pizzette looked good, but she said that the pizza I make at home is better (right!).  And chicken fingers for my son?  My wife and I looked at each other with \"...there is something we are misunderstanding here...\" expression. We read dessert descriptions - sounded like all the expensive sweet ingredients piled together and decided to pass. In any case - Giada never promised to cook Italian, and nobody dragged us to the restaurant.  So it's our fault for choosing incorrectly. But once again - wait staff carried the day - the best trained people I've ever seen.",

However, after spending over $200 for three people to have lunch and not feeling that there was anything special about our meal, our excitement quickly changed to regret.  The iced tea had zero flavor as did the meatballs. The salad was also boring and nothing special.  Stouffers makes a better lasagna.  Our waiter was somewhat rude and really didn't know much about the menu.  We ended up ordering dessert which actually was the best part of our meal and the only reason this review has one star instead of zero.  We had high hopes and actually had dinner reservations there for the next night.  However, after lunch was so disappointing, we quickly canceled those.  I guess we should've known... never trust a skinny cook!  I also forgot to mention that when we first got to the restaurant, it was not crowded at all.  The hostess tried to seat us in a corner and we asked for a better table next to the window.  She acted like we were really putting her out and was very annoyed.  She did end seating us at a table with a better view, but it did have water stains and dirty silverware.  I guess that's the price of a better view!  Like I said, save your $$$!",

    "text": "GIADA is my BAE!   So that alone is worth 4 stars right there.  I've actually never even watched her Food Network show, but that's only because someone used the \"Parental Control\" feature on my cable to block that channel due to concerns I was developing a food porn addiction. Whatever, I still have Yelp and Instagram and nothing could block me from dining at Giada!  Upon stepping off the escalator to enter Giada on the 2nd floor of The Cromwell, we arrived at their impressive hostess station and were immediately taken to our table in the main dining room. This area overlooks The Strip (primarily Caesars) and includes exceptional views of the Bellagio Fountains when seated by the windows near the terrace (request it when making your rezzy).   The interior is accentuated by the natural lighting from outside. We gazed at all the stylish decor, which is reflective of the beauty and elegance of Giada herself. The abundance of whites reminded me a bit of Fig & Olive (in LA & OC) but Giada enhances it with classy touches of gold and silver. Menus, napkins, and placemats are adorned with signature Giada and \"G\" logos. Despite the swank setting, some patrons were dressed more casually than I expected at dinner, as a few even wore shorts and sandals (on the bright side, at least they weren't dressed in any of that ridiculous EDC attire).   While we were smitten with the location of our table and views, there is also an attractive lounge and bar area that is more laid back. Near that, an open kitchen section resides before the restrooms, closer to the entrance. Don't forget to check out that display and of course, drop in the photo booth by the hostess station on your way out.  As enthralled with the environment as we were, it was time to add some accessories to our table, in the form of food and drinks!  MENU: Italian with Californian influences and a strong presence of citrus. Many dishes are intended to be light. Dinner options are much more expansive than their lunch menu. Our party of 2 shared the following:  DRINKS: they give you an iPad to browse the cocktail menu. All names are inspired by movies Giada's Grandfather produced. *Barbarella: this was made up of orange spice ginger beer, Tanqueray No. TEN, fresh lemon & basil foam, and is wonderful for mule lovers! I drank it way too fast and found myself craving another one even the next night. *Riesling: wine (for her), sweet and distinguished.  ANTIPASTI: they ranged in size. I'd recommend mixing it up by selecting from the different sections like we did. They also served a complimentary bread platter comprised of rosemary focaccia bread, Italian breadsticks, and Parmesan crisps (crackers), rounded out by trays of chili flakes, pesto, crispy fried capers, and marscapone butter. The bread was fluffy and we enjoyed the seasonings. *CHEESE: Imported Burrata w/ balsamic salt - creamy and perfect to put on the aforementioned bread and/or crisps. *SALUMI: Prosciutto di Parma - buttery, salty & sweet, pork. *MEAT: Orzo Meatballs w/ parmesan pomodoro - cute little balls (about 5 or 6) that I couldn't wait to grab. They were moist and tender. *SEAFOOD: Charred Octopus w/ potato, fennel & olive salsa - perhaps I wasn't in the mood for something charred, as I was more pleased with the other items we had.  PASTA & MAINS *SPAGHETTI: shrimp, lemon & basil - absolutely delicious, I almost wish we had ordered 2 servings. *BRANZINO: fish with tangerine vinaigrette - this was an amazing dish cooked brilliantly that practically melted in my mouth. I didn't expect to be wowed by this but it was an extremely satisfying \"main.\"  DESSERT: the menu differed from that posted online as they didn't have my zeppoles!  *LIME & PISTACHIO CAKE: Giada's twist on a Jose Andres dessert, with a fascinating presentation. Includes raspberry sorbetto and some fresh fruit.  SERVICE: matching the quality of the food and setting, they didn't miss a thing. Our server was Joseph, who provided solid recommendations and was personable and helpful throughout our meal. Water refills were consistent. The girls working as hostesses were outfitted in really hot black dresses too (if you need help convincing your guy to take you here, just show him this part of the review only).  Giada gave me a memorable night. I look forward to trying breakfast or lunch on my next visit, and in the meantime, will try to figure out how to remove that Parental Control channel block so I can watch her show!",

    "text": "Oh Giada, how I love you. I have always been a fan of her on the Food Network, and knew eventually I would be dining in this semi high end establishment that she has brought to my home town. The day finally arrived and I made sure to come hungry. Now maybe that wasn't such a good idea, considering all the portions are quite small. What is the motto they use, \"I like a little bit of everything, but not a lot of anything\".  That is an actual quote from Giada herself. And I get it. We were able to try a huge variety of items including the baby sweet peppers, multiple cheeses and meats, bucatini, pea pesto tortellini, the surf and turf, lamb, ribeye, a few sides, and a couple desserts. Of all that I mentioned, I would eat the entire meal again in a heartbeat. The pea tortellini and the lamb were favorites. The pesto had a sweet yet savory lemon/butter/basil flavor that was to die for. All of the pasta was so fresh. The portions again were small, between 4 people we shared 3 pastas. No complaints about the size, but the price for 12 small pieces of noodle being $25 is a little crazy to me, no matter who or where you are. I mean sure, it's fancy, with a great strip view and beautiful fixtures and lighting, but when it comes down to it, us natives know what the Cromwell is known for, and it IS NOT upscale dining! And speaking of fancy, I requested a window table with a view because it was the birthday of 2 of the patrons dining with us. We sure did get a window table, but it was in the corner with no view. I watched numerous other parties of 4 be seated in the prime view area. The difference, they were dressed up fancy and my party wasn't. As far as I am concerned, we still spent $500 on dinner, if my guest wants to wear a hat on his birthday, he should be able to. Especially in August in Vegas. I noticed with us being in the corner, we were not offered freshly ground black pepper or the dessert cart like other, closer tables were. Yes, small minimal complaints, but had they not happened, this would easily been a 5 star review. When you pay top dollar for a classy dinner, I expect the full experience.  The hospitality in general was fabulous and I was not disappointed with our service in anyway. I feel that any negative comments or feelings I may have, are part of Giada's restaurant as an entirety and not one specific person, dish, or dollar amount.  Overall, I absolutely would return to Giada's for a special occasion or date night. It was a fun night with an excellent meal!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this restaurant but my expectations were crushed. It's sad because I'm such a huge fan of Giada but her restaurant hype wasn't all what I expected.  First off, we came here to celebrate my Bfs birthday. my server Gregory was so awkward and rude. He rushed us to order our food. It was so weird because out of all the restaurants I've been too, I've never been rushed. He even waited awkwardly until we ordered our main entrees. If I'm going to pay $200 on food don't rush us. Cater to your customers first they are the ones that make the business. I understand you want to keep the flow of the kitchen, but don't tell us \"I prefer you order your entrees now\" even when we ordered our appetizers, he was like \"that's it\" um yes that's it because I want to order my entrees later but instead rushes us and waits awkwardly.. Who does that?   Once the service sucks the whole experience is ruined especially on a special occasion.   I have to give it to the busser tho, we wished he was our waiter. My tip should of went to him.   Her dishes were pretty good. We liked the Rosemary bread that was served, the paperdalle was a little on the salty side but still delicious, the Parmesan with the homemade fig sauce had a great flavor and last but not least the orzo meatballs were delicious.   It's a little expensive for the amount tho.   Overall ambience and the food were great But Mr.Gregory needs a lesson in manners.",

He had great suggestions and was cognizant of our time constraints. The food was absolutely outstanding. We started with an appetizer course consisting of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese with honey as well as a crostini plate with ricotta cheese. My wife had the pasta sampler and I had the lobster ravioli. The meal ended on a high note with a zepole desert as well as two free cookies courtesy of Yelp for checking in. We will definitely be returning to this fabulous establishment! Many thanks to our waiters Andre and Andrew!",

    "text": "I've been here for dinner twice  and had two different experiences.  The first visit was good food, exceptional service but the sommelier was the most pretentious person.  She poo-pooed my caymus selection but I'm confident in my wine choices.  The second visit was a few weeks later . Abhorrent service. If our server, Nancy, could have had us cook our own food she would have let us.  Dinner with 4 ppl for an anniversary and she came over maybe 3x all night and when she did it was abrupt.  The new manager did come over to try and smooth it over but we had zero interest on perpetuating the terrible experience. The food on the second visit was that of a glorified chain.  The bigger point is that all the inconsistencies cannot cut it in such a competitive environment. I give them a 5 star for location and view of the Bellagio fountain, a 3 for the somewhat narrow menu and a 2 1/2 for staff. So disappointing Giada! You can do so much better. On the other hand, Matt at Pronto in Caesars is a highlight attached to your name.",

There were so many crab shells it was inedible! The bottle of wine had a taste of vinegar.  The service was non existent. They sat us by the bar. Instead of the main dinning room. It felt like we were placed in the corner and forgotten.  Keep in mind it is very expensive for what you get. Never mind that it was aweful!  Not worth going. There are so many better restaurants that you would enjoy!  Elizabeth",

The food was flavorful and well prepared... even the bread had plenty of flavorful accompaniments to choose from. I got the Margherita pizza and the Fritto Misto apps, and  would recommend both.

    "text": "My daughter has been a Giada fan since she was a little girl, so we had to make a reservation when we were there for her graduation trip.  I was a bit hesitant to try this restaurant because we have tried many famous chef type restaurants over the years and always been disappointed.  Giada's exceeded our expectations in every way!  The restaurant is beautiful. We made a reservation in advance and were seated at a wonderful table by the windows right away.  Our waiter was fantastic, friendly, attentive, and helpful with all of our questions.  There were four of us at our table.   We tried several different appetizers and they were all delicious.  The waiter had suggested the Caprese salad and it was wonderful!  The Fritto Misto was also a favorite.  Three of us had pasta dishes as our main course.  The Scampi was delicious!  The shrimp were enormous, well seasoned, and cooked perfectly. We also tried the Lemon pasta as it was known to be one of Giada's signature dishes, and we liked it, but it definitely wasn't a favorite.  The pork chop dinner that my son had was amazing!  Huge portion, beautiful presented, deliciously seasoned.  The sides with it were fantastic.  We were all pretty stuffed by the time the dessert menu came, so we ordered one Lemon Soufle for the table and a couple of specialty coffees.  All was delicious.  The Nutella coffee was good, but the Orange coffee was fantastic!  There was about a 15 minute wait for the Lemon Soufle, as it is prepared to order, but it was creamy, warm and delicious. Definitely worth the wait!  At the end of our meal, I asked the waiter how involved Giada was with the restaurant.  He said she was there frequently and never put out a new menu without being there to check up on it and taste test everything.  We were sorry that she was due at the restaurant two days after we were there, but it was evident to us that she was definitely involved.  We have tried restaurants by Emeril, Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri and other famous chefs and have always felt a little let down.  Giada's restaurant was so different.  The service, decor, and food were all amazing.  It will definitely be on my list for another visit next time I'm in Vegas.",

Ambiance of this place is incredible, I love they have a photo booth outside in the waiting area.   My Sister and I came for early dinner like at 5pm so we were able to easily get window seating giving us an incredible of this amazing city of Las Vegas that we call home. It definitely was a one of a kind dining experience, but dining as a local at establishments like this is different than dining here as a tourist. We started with the bread & spices appetizer, & we chose from the large array of cheese choices and assortments we went with our server's recommendation of Imported Burrata. It was light and almost kinda sticky texture but it was good, I liked it, my sister not so much. It has sort of a bitter tone to it, but set off with the pesto on the side.   We went with the 28oz bone in Tuscan rib eye steak with sunny side up egg and arugula as the main meal and a variety of sides to accompany the monstrous steak which by the way has got to be the real steak and eggs combo Vegas is so known for lol The Steak was super tender! comes already sliced & cut and the meat literally melts in your mouth type food-gasm experience!! All the flavor literally down to the bone. The arugula accompanied the steak well with its unique taste and flavor and helped to not make the plate taste salty.   We had sides that included Lemon Parmesan potatoes, Spinach with golden raisins & walnuts, and Chicken Marsala meatballs. those meatballs were fantastic! amazing taste, super moist, and just a great addition to the meal as a side extra little choice.   I mean, c'mon though the moment you walk in, and are greeted by the beautiful hostess, you know the place is going to be exquisite. It really was an incredible dining experience, but for the price value of a local, my return will have to be one that warrants a very special occasion where I won't be sad to see the check.   Our service was great, and he was very well informed and answered every question we had about the incredible amount of choices on the menu. Giada's does offer a pairing or tasting menu that gives you small servings from every part of her menu along with recipes & an autographed photo with the purchase but the tasting menu has to be bought per person, but just for the entire table, I will have to have a go at that one day... one day.   Although it was an amazing dining experience, Im not so sure it lived up to it's hype. I didn't get into the Yelp Elite event that was held here, so since that event I've been dying to go, and I walked away not feeling as mind blown as I hoped I would have been. It definitely has all the makings of a fine dining establishment with the Vegas expectations, but as a local it'll be a big reason to bring me back. but at least I can say I tried it.",

    "text": "We had a reservation for 5 PM.  Checking in just prior to 5, we were asked to wait a bit.  Seating didn't take long and we were shown to a table.  Within a short time, our waiter, Rocco--one of the stars of our dinner--arrived to greet us and to ask about water/drinks.  I ordered iced tea and my dining companion got a cocktail.  It was then time to peruse the menu and decide what we wanted.  While looking at the menu, Rocco brought us a selection of bread--some breadsticks, a round baked load, some lavash, and an assortment of spices and dips for the bread and for later in the meal.  We ordered the same salad, the tricolore--with prosciutto, gorgonzola, dates, walnuts, tuscan kale, yellow endive, and radicchio.  The salad was the other star of the evening.  It was simply superb!  The dressing and the textures of the various ingredients were so good.  I did put some of the salt from the bread board on the salad.   For my main course, I got the fregolotto--with morel mushrooms, baby zucchini, and squash blossoms.  The cheese grated on the pasta, shaped like large tapioca, and the zucchini gave the pasta some flavor.  Otherwise, the dish was very bland.  It was also a small portion for its $28 price.  For dessert, I got a pistachio cake with gelato.  This had an interesting presentation.  A rather large, oval-shaped bowl with some torn pieces of pistachio cake, a small dip of raspberry sorbet, and some fresh fruit. I finished dinner with a cup of coffee.  Service throughout our almost two hours there was first rate.  Rocco and his staff were excellent.  The room is very nicely done and their was a vibrancy to the place that I liked.  On the other had, I know Giada is a celebrity.  But must everything have her name or her stylized g imprinted on it.  Before I left, I checked in the bathroom to see if I had her name stamped on my ass but it wasn't there.  Being a celebrity also means that you can take normal prices, add the surcharge for dining on the Strip, and then add another surcharge for dining in Giada's establishment.  A double whammy.    The salad was a good sized portion but the pasta was almost laughable in its size.  Following other restaurants lately, the pasta was served in a huge dish with a relatively small well in the center for the pasta.    The only thing that rescues Giada (see, I feel I have to use her name throughout the review, too), from a 2 star review would be the salad and the service.  Been there, done that, won't be back.",

The coolest thing about this place is the specialty cocktail menu with all of the drinks named after and inspired by Giada's movie producer grandfather Dino De Laurentiis. The La Strada is far more less depressing than the 1954 Fellini film it is named after. The food is fun and delectable (See my pics) So if you want a groovy eying on the town, this is a great place to start and finish. Lights! Camera! Action!

I had always wanted to go to Giada's, so I grabbed my little group and headed in.  I must say, I am so glad we had the chance to dine here!  Everything from the service to the food was spot on.  To start, our server Lindsay, was sensational.  She was super bright, bubbly and greeted us with a huge welcoming smile.  You could tell she was just as excited about the food as we were and she was happy to answer any questions we had.  She was also very descriptive about the dishes, and gave us some incredible recommendations.  I had the Lobster Ravioli, and oh lordy was it awesome!  Large chunks of lobster swimming in a lovely white wine butter sauce....it was so good I had to restrain myself from licking the plate.    I highly recommend coming down to Giada's to check out her Italian fare.  The service is exceptional, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is lively.  I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!! :)",

We had a great night out and we came back to New York raving to all our family about our new favorite dish with only three ingredients:  cacio e peppe.  What a night and what a meal!  Ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant is right up our alley.  Open windows to the strip on a beautiful night.  Treated like we were guests.  Made to feel at home.",

The ambience is casual and relaxing. Great for lunch and dates that won't kill your wallet. The restaurant is very large with a whole dining room and bar area. Don't miss the photo booth at the entrance.  They have unlimited mimossas during lunch hour. However, we just stuck to the prosecco which was smooth and sweet. I got the chicken and waffles and I was surprised with the dish. My favorite is Venetians Bouchon, but Giada is pretty comparable. They have a great sauce to compliment the chicken. My friends got crab cakes and benedicts. We liked the Almond butter the restaurant provided. I remember it took awhile for one of my friends dishes to come out.   I would return here for the chicken and waffles. I like the environment and the seating. This restaurant makes you happy. Service is friendly and attentive. They let us take an empty prosecco bottle :)",

It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for.  It was worth every penny. The calamari was a great starter and the pasta trio had three pastas with amazing flavor.  Gary was our waiter and was fantastic.  He was on top of every need we had and was very friendly.  For terrific food with great atmosphere I highly recommend Giada's.",

Beware!! You make think the sofas are comfy, but don't just plop your butt down like I did. It's pretty hard!   We saw a photo booth on the right side! It didn't print pictures that night or you couldn't email it to yourself. But you were able to take a photo in the photo booth and take a picture of the photo with your cell phone.   When we got seated, we had an excellent view of the strip! We sat along the window which made our night! People watching while we enjoyed a nice dinner-what a treat!  We started off with a bottle of moscato. It was sweet and delicious! Then we ordered the mushroom pizzette, white lasagna, and calamari.  The complimentary bread was so good! Best bread I've tasted! It tasted like it just came out of the oven!   The mushroom pizza was delicious and had a nice crunchy crust!  The white lasagna was light and very flavorful.  The calamari and shrimp was perfect! It had the perfect crunch as well and the shrimp was HUGE!!!   We also ordered a dessert. Shoot!! I forgot what it's called, but I have a photo of it! So if anyone knows what it is, please leave a comment!  This place only got 4 stars because we had empty plates on our table when we got our entree and we asked the food runner if he can take the side plates off our table, but he just walked away and acted like it wasn't his job.   But other than that, we had a nice experience!! They even gave my husband 2 of Giada's favorite cookies for his birthday! His real birthday was the day before and celebrated it at Gordon Ramsey steakhouse, but they didn't do anything nice to make my husband feel special on his day!",

We couldn't eat all of the potatoes because we were too stuffed but they were delicious. I plan to come back here again.",

I thought the atmosphere was great, the establishment was clean and airy, light and fresh. It was a great place to eat lunch on a sunny day on the strip.    I'll start with what I loved and then explain why I gave it 3 Stars.  The menus selection was great, and everything I ordered was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The serving staff was pleasant, accommodating and apologetic for anything that may have gone wrong.  I tried to order a selection of dishes from apps to mains even though I wasn't going to finish all of them (though I almost did) so I could get a great feel for the offerings.  All but the dessert impressed me.  Sadly I thought the brownie dessert was too hard, the brownie was 'frozen,' or maybe it really was.  Pizza selection was great and Giada's burger was fantastic.  Even went for a waffles dish and that was great too.   Sadly I had to give it 3 Stars because when we walked in it took a while for a host to approach us and when she did she was somewhat short/rude and condescending.  It didn't help that later during my visit she was swigging water directly from a big Acqua Panna bottle at the bar.  I just thought the way that looked was unprofessional and she could have easily poured it into a glass and drank it.  It's not her house...  Add'l there were plenty of open tables yet for some reason waking in without a reservation meant their next available was 2:30PM and it was noon when I walked in!!   They have a lounge area in the middle too with tons of seating, yet I wa stood no food service there...  Finally I was told I could sit at the bar but that it was also full.  I decided to head to the bar to have a look myself and found a. Inner of empty seats there too.    Pics attached, even one of the Acqua Panna bottle swigging (though blurry b/c I won't publicly disparage anyone as I don't know the rules at Giada's).     To their defense I was there in Saturday the 10th and I have heard that many places are short staffed this weekend since they are on vacation from the previous weekend's super bowl (biggest weekend in Vegas I hear).  So that could have lead to the reason there were many open tables but 2.5 hours to wait to be seated....?",

Although our reservation was 45 mins away from our arrival, she said it was no problem for us to sit early. Our server went over the menu for us and started us off with bread for the table. From the fried capers to the olives within the bread was a fresh and new way to present the traditional bread to the table. Then we ordered the oysters which was light and refreshing. I ordered the risotto with scallops and lobster as well as a side of broccolini. Unfortunately, the menu didn't mention that there were peas in the ristotto so I had to send it back due to my pea allergy. Manger quickly came over and accommodated. At last the dessert and Chianti was magnificent. My visit to Giada's restaurant exceeded my expectations. Bravo!",

It's located on 2nd floor of Cromwell Hotel/Casino. From the lobby, take escalators on the right which will take you directly to the restaurant. We had reservation for party of 4 and didn't have to wait very long. There's a cozy seating lounge next to guest check-in. Make sure to check out the photo booth on the left. We were seated right by the windows overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The view of Bellagio fountains at night is breathtaking. Perfect place to take a date for intimate night of dining or any special occasion. Restaurant is elegant and beautiful just like you would expect from the famous owner.  Menu looked very intimidating and we were clueless on what to order. Thank goodness for yelp photos on guidance. Food is somewhat pricey, but worth it. Expect to shell out $75-$100 per person. Glass of wine range from $13-$18 and cheapest bottle of wine was $75. Since it was my birthday, it was skies the limit...of course I offered to pay a portion of the bill from my recent winnings at the casino tables.  We started off with mushroom arancini (fried meat ball served with pesto aioli sauce) and spinach & buffalo ricotta pizzette for appetizers. We weren't a big fan of mushroom aracini, but we did enjoy the pizzette which was yummy. Complimentary bread was provided too. It was divine!  For the food, we ordered the following:  Tuscan Tomahawk Rib Eye Steak - My personal favorite and all for me. It was humongous and attracted a lot of oohs and aahs from my table. Perfectly cooked medium, very well seasoned and was outstanding. Worth $83 price tag. It doesn't come with any sides so I ordered it with roasted broccolini which paired nicely with the steak.  Lobster ravioli - lusciously good and ravioli melts in your mouth. The lobster sauce rocks this dish.  Seared salmon vegetable succotash & whole grain mustard - light crisp on top, tender and delicious.   Fettuccine di Amalfi with lemon pork ragu - scrumptious and ragu was on point.  We were full and passed on dessert. However, I did get some complimentary cookies for my birthday which were delicious. Sorry no pics...lets just say it was devoured instantly before I can get camera out.  All in all, it was a night to remember. I got the opportunity to sample everyone's dishes and all were terrific. Service was good too. The staff was very attentive, helpful and we didn't feel hurried. With exception to the steak, portions were smaller but perfect unless you wanted to take home. Great choice and definitely recommend to anyone who enjoy good Italian food.",

Looked at website before hand and it says \"make sure to ask for a window seat.\" Upon arriving I did ask. Restaurant was not crowded with at least two open window seats and 8 open on wall across from window. We were seated as far away as could be near the bar and no one was ever seated near us. When seated I asked again for a window seat and was told by the hostess there was none although every other customer was seated where it was open when we arrived. Observed another customer asked to be moved closer to the window and they were. Manager came by and asked how it was going. I explained the issue and the attitude of the hostesses. He apologized. Food was good and for dessert we had the sampler. My wife asked for a coffee americano. It never came. Manager again stopped by and asked how was everything. Three quarters through the dessert a plain coffee cane. When waiter brought bill he told us the manager took off the coffee... wow good recovery... really?  Don't come here super often but you may have lost this customer for good and I can no longer recommend.",

The only reason it's not 1 Star is the manager comped two main dishes  Good: The service was excellent. The waiter and his assistant did everything they could to make the dinner memorable. The bread and appetizers were excellent.  Bad: Both my son and I had the lobster ravioli. When we tried them I actually thought it might be a cold dish but it was a little warm for cold. I asked the waiter who took it back. When it came back it was now warm but still not hot. I wasn't expecting flaming hot so you could not eat but 30 seconds in the flash oven would have at least taken the chill off. It tasted good but not what I would expect for a high end celebrity restaurant",

The rosemary bread, irresistible. I had the summer capers, which included watermelon slices and it was surprising, refreshing and amazing. But, my favorite dish was the ravioli, with huge delectable lobster chunks and the most amazing, lemony, butter sauce. The best meal we had in Vegas! I can't wait to go back.",

Our reservation was for 5:00 pm arrived had a few minute wait long enough to get a cocktail from the bar area which is a very nice sitting area with comfy sofas and chairs perfect for after a long day of walking! I checked in with Yelp when we arrived and was given a choice of a glass of prosecco or cookies. I chose the cookies because they are amazing!!! We ordered Giada's small plate appetizer which had stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates and crostini. For our main course I had the rigatoni and my son had the pasta flight.we also ordered the mashed asparagus casserole for a side. It taste like broccoli rice casserole .  Great dinner. It's a little pricey but worth the splurge! They have a photo booth in a little spot when you check in so make sure you take your picture!!!!",

    "text": "I came for one of my favorite peoples birthday. There were so many people interested that a few of us made a reservation of a few smaller tables and then just asked if we can be seated together.  While I wasn't there to witness it, it seemed this was OK with the GM as the bday girl talked to him. She had to email the reservations manager according to them who tried to make us take these pre fixe group menu or impose a spending minimum. NO. We have 3 separate reservations and not some ginoromous group even with all of us. No. Those group menus weren't interesting to most of us. We just asked to be in tables near each other. It put a bad taste in my mouth and almost cancelled if it wasn't a point we can argue out of. I get trying to let us know as a option and to maybe be easier for the kitchen but any other parties of 6- 10 people wouldn't have this imposed on them I'm sure. It's only because we asked to sit by each other.   We arrived at dinner - and no, we didn't do the group menus.   It took a little while to get orders in and get bread, but once the dinner rolled on the pace was good and food came in a fairly timely manner. As a side note, I think iPad menus are not needed. It froze up quite a few times on us and talked about antipasto platters that were not on the main menu you could miss. It also talked about alcoholic beverages that were in the wine list booklet already.   Breadservice was good. There was a small pot of herb focaccia, some crisps and breadsticks and a tray of condiments- pesto, finishing salt, red pepper, lemon marscapone butter, fried capers  I decide to split up some items with my friend Anthony.   Caponata had pleasant texture of the veggies were good, but a tad too sweet. I like when it's sweet and tangy. It could have been a big hit for me with a bit of acidity. I tried to offset with a bit of the fried capers and red pepper from the condiment tray. This really should come with some nice bread though. It was okay on the crisp and the focaccia, but I didn't get enough bread as the basket was small and there were 6 people.  Grilled octopus - simple flavors, but the octopus was tender. Everything was cooked nicely, but I wish there was something to give the octopus with diced potatoes some oomph. A nice puree, sauce, veloute to add a little something.  Marsala chicken meatballs were decent. I like that it wasn't too sweet as marsalas can be but more a wine-y flavor.Came with a few mushrooms and 2 small tomatoes on the stem.  Veal Saltimbocca was lovely.Nicely crisp, the cheese stuffing was solid and it was well seasoned. I like the incorporation of sage on it. It was a good size, maybe about 14-16oz.  Crispy Polenta was our side for the veal. It was simple, but good though mine wasn't really crisp. I enjoyed the tomato sauce that was on it.   Dessert cart I chose a honey, chocolate and almond tart. This was almost perfect. The florentine cap on top was money. The texture of the chocolate filling was nice but a tad too sweet along with the honey and would have preferred a bitter chocolate to offset. However, it was really well made and still pretty damn good.   Out of my meal, the standout was the veal saltimbocca. It was the singular item I would order again and considering it was the most expensive then perhaps it was a good thing that it was worth it.   Service was OK, but had some hiccups. Like I mentioned earlier it took a moment to take off as I don't know why the server was going to our table, answer questions then disappeared a few times. The bussers were a little too plate eager. I had my plate taken while I was still eating bread but turned to have a conversation and found it gone. We took the bone off the veal then split it in half and place it on my individual plate. A moment after the plate was being lifted from us and I had to say wait! the lemon and the sauce was still on there so he placed the dish of the sauce on the table as I took the lemon and left. Sucks because the veal bone has all those good little pieces left and he took my utensils on the plate.   Apparently our other table had hiccups too. Most notable is being poured water like crazy and getting charged $64 for still water. Really, they should have been asked if they wanted to order more. The water was not branded bottles even. Its the reusable kind that Echo&Rig use for their water which they give you for FREE.   Now the food ultimately is what it is about. It was good, but nothing blew my mind. It was good, but not on par with its cost.When you have a town where there are some good off strip fresh pasta, seasonal ingredient Italian food, I have other, better options. On top of that, I am a bit critical of some things I believe I do well at home. A few people had the risotto and it did not hold up to the one the fiance and I make - their words, not mine.   It's not a bad  meal, but I think there are better experiences I've had on and off the strip that I would return to first before stepping here.",

    "text": "This was the saviour to my birthday dinner!  We originally went to another place for my birthday dinner and was so disappointed so my husband decided to take me here for my birthday while we were in Vegas.  The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL!  The decor and the large windows overlooking the corner of the Strip.  You can get a full view of Bellagio's water fountain and it's just so pretty.  We were able to sit next to the window which I loved every minute of it!   We ordered the following:   - Lobster Arancini - recommended by our waiter, it was good.  There could've been more lobster flavor but the sauce and the arancini were really good together!   - Charred Octopus - this was a great dish!  We love octopus and the octopus was tender and soft.  Yummy!   - Spaghetti - this was absolutely my FAVORITE!  The fresh pasta and the lemony sauce with the shrimp was so good and creamy!  The best part of the restaurant is that they give you a platter for spices to help flavor your meal as to how salty you want it.  I used some of the salt as well as the fried capers to add to this dish and it was PERFECTO!  YUMMY!   - Rack of Lamb - hubby ordered it and was in heaven.  He loves lamb and they cooked it perfectly.   - Spinach - this was also delicious with the golden raisins and walnuts!  Yummy!!   The drinks were also great too!  And they made me a mocktail since I don't drink alcohol.   The desserts were also divine!  The lemon meringue dessert and the chocolate lava cake were SO GOOD!!!    Service was great and the waiter was very attentive!  We are definitely coming back for brunch next time to try it out!  So happy with this place!",

PLUS The ambiance was really pretty and service was great but food was not up to par. Drinks were good, but they were $15 for a small champagne glass.  -Burrata, was very bland, texture was really strange. It was almost stringy and soggy.  -Lobster Ravioli, ravioli was dry, the wrapper felt like it wasn't cooked through, I tasted no cheese in the filling (per our waiter there was suppose to be cheese? lack of this probably made it dry). The sauce it came with was not sauce. It tasted and looked like a stick of butter melted and plopped on the plate.   -Shrimp spaghetti, was the best tasting dish. Meaning, it was not amazing, but it was just ok. It was really salty and dry.  For about $34-36 per pasta dish, they were small and really disappointing.   There are so many other delicious places for this price range in vegas.",

Had a window seat overlooking the strip. The large windows fold open to let in the fresh air! The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. We were served by more than one person which would be my only complaint but the service was fast and efficient. I had the salmon eggs Benedict with spinach and my friend had the polenta waffles with berries. I was very impressed with the restaurant's decor and attention to detail... loved the tiny \"G's\" circling the dishes. A tad pricey but worth the positive experience.",

The Rosemary bread that's placed in each table is super yummy too. The drinks are overpriced (like all drinks everywhere in Vegas) and my signature cocktail was diluted with too much sprite.

    "text": "Giada Giada Giada. This place is amazing. What a BEAUTIFUL venue. Located in the Cromwell on the second floor with views to die this is a great place for lunch or dinner. We came for lunch and the natural lighting from the panoramic windows truly kept the place bright. It was a two hour wait for a table by the window so we sat at the bar. Which is perfect because we really are bar people.   Now the ONLY reason Im giving a 4 star review instead of a 5 Star is for the service. The bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be greeted. When we finally were I ordered a Ciroc and Soda and the guy didnt even know what Ciroc was.. Now i would understand if I ordered something completely off the wall but I mean come on... thats pretty standard. Andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a regular coffee lol The other bartender Nicole was also kind of a nightmare. She was giving away drinks left and right to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them?   But when that was over we started ordering a few dishes. We had the Pasta Fazoli soup which was pretty good, not the best but certainly not the worst. We also had the marinated olives, also not the best. BUT then we tried the Chicken Marsala meatballs and those were phenom. 5 bite sized meatballs with roasted wiled mushrooms. wow. they seriously melted in your mouth. so good! then we had the Salumi Picante Pizza. This is probably one of the best food items Ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and oregano. But let me just talk about the crust for a second... That pizza dough could cure cancer. I mean seriously it was AMAZING.  For dessert we had the zeppoli. Now im a huge fan of this dessert, its always been my go-to while at an Italian restaurant but this one was made like Ive never had before. It wasnt sweet, like Ive normally had. And it had lemon zest sprinkled all over. Im going to have to try it again to see if i really liked it because oddly enough Im kind of unsure.   This was a great place and we will def be back, but we will make a reservation for a table next time and hopefully receive better service.",

    "text": "First, you need to plan ahead, You need a reservation if you are going with a group. Pro-tip: Make reservation, otherwise you will be waiting a long time or possibly not even able to dine here.  Parking:  This is Vegas.  Valet at the hotel.  Service: Great. They worked well as a team. Several requests for extra bread/plates/etc were fulfilled quietly and efficiently.  Food:  Salumi e Formaggi: ($69) We started with meat and cheese platter. Server knew each and every cut of meat and type of cheese. It is pretty large. You will need a decent group to devour.  We shared several pizzas, sandwiches, and salads. Gorgonzola kale ($16) - I did not try. Faro Salad ($15)  - Not bad Romaine salad with Chicken ( $28)  Typical romaine salad.  Nothing outstanding.  Pro-tip: Don't order the lobster roll. Not worth the 35 bucks (Oct 2014 price). Tenderloin sliders ($30)  I did not try it.  But, heard it was not that moist.  Salumi Picante Pizza ($16) It was yummy in my tummy. Pancetta Egg pizza ($16)  Pancetta and sunny side egg on top.  Do I need to say anymore?    G's baked pasta ($24)  Their version of an individual lasagna.  It was pretty good. Small portion so terrible for sharing.   Downside: We did not see nor get any pictures taken with Giada.  We tried Giada's Sangria ($15)  The red was better than their white. So order the red.    Pro-tip: Don't forget to take pictures in their photobooth.  The printer was not working during our visit. Boohoo but you can email yourself the pictures.  Overall, this place has great pizza and service. I would recommend. Just make sure to bring $$$.  This is 3.5 stars.",

Originally we were not able to make a reservation, but we came early (~6:00 PM) on a Friday and the staff was able to accommodate us.  The pasta was especially good - we had the pappardelle, spaghetti, and ravioli.  We also ordered the lamb - there were 4 of us and we ate it all family style.   We also had the marinated olives, orzo meatballs, and bacon dates as appetizers.  All were quite good.   We decided to go Italian-style and order sparkling mineral water with our meal, which I think added to the experience (especially since we don't drink much wine).     As the sun set, the restaurant opened the windows which overlooked the Las Vegas strip.   It was a great view.  Our indoor dining was now al fresco. With the warm Vegas nights, this additional physical feature of the restaurant made the experience much more enjoyable.  Regarding service, again, it was top notch.  Our waiter, Cliff, was very personable and attentive.  He made us feel like family.   The only minor down side we saw was when a different waiter accidentally broke a glass by our table and did not immediately clean up the glass shards, waiting for one of the other staff to clean it up",

    "text": "(part 2)  Entrees: - Seared Salmon; - Sicilian Roasted Lamb; - 7oz Filet; - Porterhouse for two; - Veal Chop Saltimbocca;  The prix fixe came with a choice of the salmon or the the lamb, both diners enjoyed their choices.  We had a second plate of the lamb and I even had a chance to try a lamb chop.  The mustard crust with spinach, nuts and raisins, and herb imparted a nice flavor to the lamb and all the while not allowing it to dry out while keeping the center a rich magenta red color.  The 7oz filet is a conservative choice but kicked up with the presence of salsa verde and fried polenta.  I'm sure the porterhouse is an off the menu replacement for the Tuscan Ribeye tomahawk which they apparently ran out of that evening (as well as burrata -- how can this happen? In Las Vegas of all places?)  The one-and-a-half-inch thick porterhouse had a terrific presentation in a wok covered with mushrooms and an herb gremolata cooked a light medium-rare temp, sliced and plated separately.  The seasoning was a bit heavy handed in parts and the strip steak portion was predictably a little thick and chewy.  Though it was sized for two, I wanted to make sure I tried the Veal Chop.  For some reason I was expecting a grilled veal chop the likes of which you would find at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill but instead it was prepared milanese style like schnitzel or katsu.  Not that this was bad, it was just a poor substitute for a grilled steak; this is when I really missed not having the Tuscan Ribeye...  Sides: - Smashed Lemon Potatoes; - Sweet Corn & Spicy Sausage; - Peas, parsley, pancetta, pecorino; - Asparagus, white & green;  Sides were served family style like they do at a traditional steakhouse.  All were worthwhile.  I recommend the peas because they're prepared really fresh and snappy like they're fresh out of a pod;  betcha never had peas like this before...  Desserts: - Honey Chocolate Almond Florentine (?); - Strawberry Crostata; - Chocolate Amaretti Cake; - Chocolate Chip Cookies w/Hazelnuts; - cheesecake; - Cherry Cream Puff; - Lemon Ricotta Cookie; - Chocolate Tiramisu, PB&J Tiramisu; - Strawberry Polenta Cake; - Nipple of Venus chocolate truffle; - Coffee Sorbetto, Strawberry Sorbetto;  I think I got most of these right, they were all from the rose gold dessert cart.  There were at least 4 sorbetto and gelato, and several kinds of tiramisu, but the most memorable to me were the Chocolate Amaretti cake lined up in a row because I love ganache, and the Nipple of Venus (!) of course.  Most of the desserts were also embellished with gold flake.  Prix fixe diners were allowed up to five items, but all six of us were able to choose up to five picks because it's my birthday... =)  The service we received from our Server Cliff was exemplary. He was courteous, attentive, and prompt.  He told us up-front and early that the Tuscan Ribeye and the burrata were not available and I unfairly told him how ridiculous I thought that was, I now know that he was just the unwitting messenger...  Perhaps it's my familiarity with her recipes and her cooking style that is mainly on display here as I'm convinced that many of her dishes are taken from her books, some of which I've actually made;  if you're a fan of her food like I am then I'm sure that you'll like the offerings.  Even though she wasn't present that evening, I couldn't leave without a signed version of her most recent cookbook.  Don't miss out on the chance to take a souvenir selfie from the photo booth too...",

Not only did they have the best coffee just out of their carafe that we had for breakfast during our stay but the food was terrific. My husband had the hash which he loved full of fresh vegetables and I had 2 eggs with side of spinach in olive oil and tomato and potatoes. It makes such a difference with good, fresh ingredients. They give you a choice of condiments which included lemon zest marscapone butter, chocolate almond butter, strawberry jam, pepper and Himalayan sea salt. The bread was fantastic so we stayed longer and even tried their muffins which were equally fantastic! Excellent",

We had early dinner service and arrived early with bar service. My wife was amused by Jane Fonda in Baberrella. Our reservation was honored and seated at a table for two at meazzanine level. View was excellent but not distracting. The antipasto came with bread service. The fried calamari was excellent. The pasta service had fresh scallops were fresh not frozen. Lemon flavored risotto was fresh and creamy. Main entry of lobster was roasted, however by this time we were full and retained some pieces to take home and make lobster bisque. Desert with sweet wine from Austria was a nice choice. You almost wished for a cigar bar to continue the experience, but this is a family atmosphere dining service. The wine choices were well explained by there wine expert. Top level choices, but mainly French  This was a full dinner and not a tasting menu. Cost for two about 250$ including gratuity. A nice treat and if I return give an idea what to order",

Our waiter was very nice. We did not get a window view. We sat in booth type table. Everything is very close together. When I needed to get up from my sofa type seating my butt was literally hitting the table next to me, and I was moving sideways. That is how close the seating is. I guess that is why it is very quiet in there. Everybody whispers or says nothing at all except the staff. Too me, it was okay for the first time. The food was okay, nothing for me to rant about. I would suggest to try it once. Very high end and pricey.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d6698355-r324810058-Giada-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=ca0fc7fae6fa0e890c7f776b4a796887c83b8ed8f1c369096fdf93fa068c3527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner there last night.   THE GOOD  The restaurant was pretty inside and is nicely appointed.   I ordered the charred octopus which was really good. I also had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp which was excellent. My wife had the margherita pizzette which she really liked. For her main course, she has the rigatoni with the vegetable bolognese which was also really good.   THE BAD  While the food was really good, the service was a bit lacking. Our waiter was attentive and did a pretty good job during dinner. He forgot to come back to the table to ask my wife what glass of wine she would prefer after serving mine to me. At the beginning of the meal, the waiters are required to present a pre-fixe menu at $120/person which includes an autographed picture of Giada. The way this is presented in a leatherette binder is completely cheesy. You would think that he is presenting the Holy Grail to you.  THE UGLY  When we had finished our dinner, the waiter asked of we were interested in dessert. We told him that we were and a guy proceeded to wheel a cart of desserts over. He reviewed the desserts with us and I chose chocolate gelato. Instead of going to the kitchen to retrieve the desserts, he proceeded to scoop out the gelato from a metal container on the dessert cart. The container was not chilled because the gelato was mostly melted and placed on our table. All of the desserts are served from the cart. And the cart is sitting out the entire night near the entrance to the restaurant which allows all of the desserts to come to room temperature and most of the desserts are uncovered all night. It is quite disgusting!!  If you go here, avoid dessert!",

    "text": "Had lunch for the 2nd time at Giada's on  Oct 16.  The Maitre 'D who seated us, didn't smile or offer any sort of pleasantry.   Not a very welcoming first impression.  He did ask if we wanted a booth or a table.  I asked if we could see the choices and he led us into the dining room and then stopped.  We all stood there awkwardly until I finally said, \"we'll take a table\".   It was a great location but didn't know beforehand as he didn't point anything out.  The stiff, formal vibe continued with our server.   I asked about the bread basket - she said it wasn't served at lunch, but that she would bring me 1 kind of bread - I had 2 choices.  She was not very gracious about it.   There was too long of a wait to get our wine, considering the restaurant was not crowded.    Received a small tray of condiments consisting of salt, pepper and toppings for toast.  Two of the dishes were chipped and one of the toppings had a skin on it from sitting around for too long.    About 34 of the way through our meal, I noticed a bug swimming in my wine.  I have no idea how long it had been in there.  We are seated by open windows, so I understand that these things can happen.  It took a while to get our server's attention as she was helping a large group.  When I was able to get her attention, I didn't complain or make a big fuss, I just pointed out the little visitor in my wine.  Her response  was to say - \"My Apologies.  I will get you a fresh splash\" and she walked away.  I would have expected her to promptly remove the glass, but I had to look at it for awhile longer.  She did come back shortly and remove the glass.  It seemed to take longer than necessary to get a replacement.  When I did get it, it held the \"exact\" amount as the glass she removed.   She must have measured it, or maybe just removed the bug.  Then she proceeded to lay a cocktail napkin over the top of our wine glasses to prevent further bugs from landing in our wine - at least that's what I'm assuming, as no words were spoken.   No other guests had napkins covering their drinks. I'm not sure what her intent was, but the impact of her actions resulted in us feeling like children needing help.  We may be \"seniors\", but we do have all our faculties.  At most restaurants, I think the wine would have been comped or at least it would have been a more generous pour.  The decor is stunning and the food was good, but not good enough to bring me back to a restaurant  with such formal, stiff, and  seemingly indifferent customer service.  As a comparison, we had dinner at a Steak House that evening, and we were blown away by the very friendly and pleasant treatment we received by their staff.",

We ordered the seafood tower for 4-5 people and while the quantity of seafood that came was abundant, the quality wasn't good. Next I ordered the romaine salad which was just fine and the lobster ravioli.  I know Giada likes her pasta al dente, but this was beyond. It was just bad. Pasta wasn't soft and the lobster flavor was just meh. Almost as if it had sat out for a while after cooking. I didn't order another  course because it just wasn't good.   Very pricey for the quality. I will say the waiter comped us some desserts, and I can't even remember what they were they were so uninspiring. And this was just a few days ago!! The wine was the best part but should be for $24/glass. Don't waste your time on this place.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this restaurant and finally made it in for lunch one day. Reservations for dinner are at least a week away which I don't understand as there are usually empty tables around. Maybe they don't have enough staff or want to make it feel more exclusive. We easily got a reservation for lunch, but when we arrived their system was down and said they needed to wait until it was up again as they had no way to confirm I had a real reservation. I showed them the email confirmation and they said they would seat us soon. We had to talk to them a couple of more times and they sat us when we said we had to be out by a certain hour. After that hiccup, our server was extremely attentive and the food was at our table timely.   I was craving the baked pasta (lasagna for Sunday) but our server would not recommend it as it had mixed reviews from other diners and the kitchen was still modifying the recipe. I ended up getting the muffuletta sandwich and was underwhelmed. The bread was not soft and fresh, and the overall taste was nothing extraordinary. I got the zucchini scapecci as the side and this was my favorite part of the meal. My friend got the tuna sandwich which was better than the muffuletta, but be warned it is not fresh tuna.   I would like to go back and give it another shot. The space and decor are beautiful but so far it felt like it was more about the celebrity chef than the food.",

    "text": "For her first time out, Giada's gotten everything right.  My husband and I went on a Monday for lunch, thus ensuring us an immediate seat since it probably wasn't going to be busy.   When we were seated, I was absolutely in awe of how beautiful the restaurant was. It was so elegant, yet warm at the same time. Kudos to the decorator! It didn't feel stuffy at all and it felt like everyone was welcome unlike other restaurants who make you feel like you need a Black AMEX to eat there. lol The view is wonderful if you are lucky enough to get a seat by the window.   The staff was amazing! She trained her staff so well! Above and beyond the call of duty. The waiter was so attentive and friendly. He answered all of our questions and made sure we were properly taken cared of. All his recommendations were delicious. The other members of the staff were so helpful as well. When I asked the gentleman filling the water glasses where the restroom was, he dropped everything he was doing to walk me over to where it was. Now that is great hospitality. We also ordered bottled water and when that bottle ran out, they gave us additional cups filled with filtered water as to not mixed with the bottle water. Such detail!  On to the food. The complimentary bread and dipping sauce were very good. Even though the sauce looked too oily, it was bursting with flavor. I enjoyed it immensely. We ordered the orzo meatballs, Pasta e Fagoli soup, lobster roll, and G's baked pasta. The orzo meatballs were so creative and yummy. I never thought to add pasta to a meatball. Ingenius! Only bad thing was that it was such a small portion. I could have eaten two more plates of them. The soup was good, but the beans were a little undercooked in my opinion. My lobster roll was not like any lobster roll that I had ever tasted before. The lobster was cooked in lemon and basil. Very light and tangy. Not heavy at all. I really appreciated that. Alone, the lobster would be so amazing, but what sealed it all together was the heavenly bread that the lobster rested upon. Such buttery goodness and combined with the lobster, it was like my taste buds were singing hallelujah! :P The arugula salad that came with the entree was a nice compliment to the roll. My husband got the G's baked pasta and even though I didn't try it, he said it was tasty. It looks deceivingly small, but filled him up 3/4 of the way through.    The prices are high even though the restaurant gives off a casual feel, but I do believe you get what you pay for. The ambiance, the service, and the quality is all there. You can tell that the food was made with time and love. Bravo! I am a fan!",

We were also meeting friends here later in the day for dinner.   I know that it's a brand new restaurant and it's in Vegas, but the decor really blew me away. It's that impressive. The location is also great at the intersection of Las Vegas blvd and Flamingo road. The wife had breakfast contadina which she enjoyed. She really liked the polenta cake and the wilted spinach that came along with her eggs. I had the Italian hash and it was delicious with only a hint of being under seasoned. Service was good and attentive. Also the view from our table was nice.   Later the same day, they were quite busy for dinner so overall the dining room was louder with the high ceilings accentuating the noise. Due to the amount people filling the restaurant the service did suffer a little. For dinner, the wife and I split the mushroom pizza as an app and she went with the branzino and I opted for the farrotto, which for me was underwhelming. The wife enjoyed her fish and the pizza was alright. Overall dinner was a good experience but I would probably only return here for breakfast or brunch at this point. As I said above, the view is great earlier in the day.",

Nancy was our server and not only recommended the best dishes, she also helped connect us to someone to help my colleague find a gift for his wife! We've been in Vegas for 4 days, have had wonderful meals, but our experience at Giada's was most certainly our favorite! We had the arrancini, salami, parmigiana cheese, lemon spaghetti, lobster ravioli and the bucatini. Everything was delicious!",

We were seated at our table and it took them 10 minutes for the waiter to come by to ask us if we wanted something to drink. After that the service staff took 20-30 minutes to take our order and never came by to ask us if we wanted a second drink or to ask us how the food was. Then when desert was supposed to be served it took them another 10-15 minutes to come by and ask what we want. When we left we told the manager about the issue we had and they blew us off like they didn't even care about our opinion. What a terrible representation you all have for this restaurant.",

Taylor had a friendly smile when we approached the front, and was amicable when we requested to be seated by a window. Radoslav was a friendly and welcoming host who explained the menu and and answered our questions. Each of us chose the tasting menu. Our appetizer sampler was delicious, as well as our pasta dishes (rigatoni vegetable bolognese and spaghetti with lemon and shrimp). My friend's main course was the branzino which was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I didn't quite finish my roasted chicken cacciatore because in found it to be a little too greasy. Our polenta and lemon potato sides were delicious!!! My water glass was never empty thanks to Russell! Hydration is such an important detail while in LV. An extra thank you to Percy who had the very important job of protecting the dessert cart from being stolen by me. He was also gracious and helpful in picking out the top desserts for us to try. I will definitely stop by again the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Spent the weekend in Vegas celebrating our anniversary my girlfriend gave the choices of eating here and Gordon Ramsay steak. While she gave me a choice she reviewed menus and ultimately decided on Giadas.    We arrived and there were several young ladies waiting at the top of the escalator one checked us in while the others just talked.....we were sat down pretty quickly and given menus. Only to find the menus had changed a bit and the dish my girlfriend had made the decision on was no longer on the menu later confirmed by the waiter.    He was a friendly guy refilled our water glasses several times seeing as they were a bit small and we didn't order alcohol because we don't drink.    I ordered the lobster ravioli and she had a pasta with shrimp....we also ordered calamari and shrimp as an appetizer.    The calamari and shrimp was very very greasy, like something you'd get from a neighborhood fish and chips spot not quite what I expected from a restaurant like this. I got my ravioli......which again was very disappointing there were like 4 or 5 and a bit cold. Pasta is best al dente yes, but this had almost a not quite ready bite to it.   Two pasta dishes and greasy calamari and shrimp set me back over 100 which I don't mind paying for to have great food but this was far from. Was very disappointed with the food we had there left and went to White Castle.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of Giada's recipes and cook them all the time at home, so it was a no-brainer that we'd try her restaurant on our trip to Vegas.  We went twice - first for lunch and then again for brunch on our last day.  The restaurant and bar is beautiful with a gorgeous view of the fountain show at the Bellagio. The hostesses and our waiter were very personable.  We ordered cocktails to start the meal.  The waiter offered some suggestions and we then selected about seven different dishes that we planned to share between two of us.  Unfortunately, this is where the service broke down.  Four dishes came out immediately - all either room temp or slightly warmer.  A few minutes after we started eating, my Bellini was delivered. So instead of savoring my leisurely lunch cocktail before the meal, it was lost amid the food.  Our \"Baked Pasta of the Day\" arrived next - a vegetarian lasagna which was borderline cold.  No melty cheese or steamy pasta - a cold mess.  We didn't eat more than a couple bites.  (I think it would have been DELICIOUS if it had been hot...)  :(  Unfortunately, our waiter was MIA after the food came out so there was no way to ask for a re-heat.  When he eventually came by again, we pointed out that the Gorgonzola Pizza we had ordered never came out.  About 10 minutes later, the pizza was delivered and SAVED THE MEAL!  The Gorgonzola Pizza with kale and mushrooms was hot, rich and amazing..........  (Seemed like the mushrooms on the pizza are the same as the ones on the mushroom antipasti dish - wish our waiter had told us that...)  Once we finished the pizza, our waiter came by with dessert menus.  We had felt pretty rushed through our whole meal (even though it wasn't busy at that hour), so we took our time with the dessert menus, eventually settling on the zeppoles, a cookie assortment and hot tea.  Delicious!  The view, the pizza and the cookies were the highlight of our lunch.  I loved the tea cups and inquired about buying one, but was told they weren't selling them yet.  :(  On the way out, we found the Photo Booth by the hostess stand - such a great touch and so fun!  Despite the service and chilly food temps (which sometimes happens at newer restaurants), I still loved this restaurant enough to go back on our last day for breakfast.  We ordered the Gorgonzola pizza again (yes - it is THAT good!) and also split an order of the Eggs Benedict with salmon cakes.  I am not really a breakfast person but this dish might have changed my mind on that!  Delicious and served at just the right temp.  Mmm...  We also ordered the cookie plate again - couldn't resist.  (In fact, the thumbprint PB&J cookies were so delicious, I made a whole batch the day I got home!)  Before we left, my friend inquired again about the teacup and -surprise!- they suddenly had one we could buy.  Strange that they were suddenly available - but YAY!  I have my lovely teacup!  All in all - I will definitely go back to Giada's the next time I'm in Vegas.  Hopefully she'll actually be in the restaurant ~ our waiter said she comes in a couple times a month and we had missed her by just one day!",

    "text": "Our reservation was easily made through Open Table. We were seated within a few minutes of our arrival. Nancy greeted us at our table and guided us through our decision making process. Decisions. Decisions. I really wanted to try the summer tasting menu, but it required a minimum of 2 people and my family just wasn't feeling adventurous. My husband and my children, ages 8 and 13, are particularly picky eaters when it comes to Italian food, so we had a little bit of a challenge even choosing something off of the children's menu. However, Nancy was very patient with us and made sure that our special pasta order was made just right. While we reviewed the menu, we were given a bread plate with a neat selection of toppings such as capers, sea salt etc... Everyone enjoyed the selection. I ordered the chicken marsala meatballs $14, the mortadella pizzette $13, the arugala salad $16 and red sangria $15. I thoroughly enjoyed everything. However, the mortadella pizzette was surprisingly a bit too simplistic. It literally was just a slice of mortadella lunch meat on a pizzette crust. That's it. Nothing else. If I had only ordered this, I would have been disappointed. My husband ordered the spicy sausage pizzette and the romaine salad. He wasn't impressed with either, yet ate everything. My check in on Yelp gave me a choice of a free splash of Prosecco or a free cookie sampler. Since I had already enjoyed a delicious glass of sangria, I opted for the cookie samples. We got a lemon cookie and a peanut butter cookie. Since I do not care for peanut butter, I claimed the lemon cookie. Yum! It was really good. My husband enjoyed the peanut butter cookie. He said it was really good too! The kid's meal came with a s'mores ice cream sandwich made of 2 chocolate chip cookies and a huge scoop of s'mores ice cream. My boys loved it.  So, in the end, we left happy. It would have been nice if we had been seated by a window with a view of the strip though. I will request that next time.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I recently spent the weekend in Vegas to celebrate our anniversary.  We only had time (and budget) to have one nice meal out to celebrate, and chose Giada, indicating in our reservation that it was our anniversary.  When we arrived for our 8pm reservation, we were told they were running a little bit behind, about 10 minutes.  We were finally seated more than 30 minutes later.  Our table was in a slightly awkward location, in what basically amounted to a walkway with only one other table next to us (and the bar area behind my boyfriend's seat).  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to bring us water, and when our server came almost 10 minutes after that she asked if we were seated here by the hostess - the way she asked made it seem like we weren't supposed to be sitting there, as if we would have seated ourselves.  Notably, the table next to us was empty and remained so and several other tables were empty in the restaurant.  It took another 10-15 minutes for my cocktail to arrive, and they never brought my boyfriend's.  The cocktail (the new Frose) WAS incredible, but I ended up having to nurse it the whole time as it became quickly apparent we were not going to be attended to well.  Our waters weren't refilled (for the first time) until we had been sitting for more than an hour.  When our server finally had time to come back, we had already been sitting with the menu for nearly 30 minutes and placed our order.  Food also was slow to come (thankfully we had a second bread plate delivered because at this point we were getting really hungry). The food was incredible, we had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp cooked perfectly and the most delectable perfect mid-rare salmon (which is why my review is even two stars).  I was never offered another cocktail, we still only had water refilled twice and we were there for over 2 hours (closer to 3).  Our server was finally attentive and nice when it came time to have a dessert course, which we didn't order (but were offered a couple of cookies because it was our anniversary).   I'm from Chicago where we have a plethora of fine dining experiences on par with Giada.  I chose this restaurant because I adore Giada, have met her for several cookbook signings and truly love her food.  I'm genuinely disappointed and saddened by the poor service in the restaurant.  From the front desk to servers and expediters, no one was friendly, engaging, or terribly interested in making our experience a good one.  Definitely a disappointment for sure (but at least the food was tasty).",

Great food and cocktail menu, just all a little more expensive then they should be but I get that it's Vegas (Cocktails are $15 each).  We had two appetizer platters, two bottles of wine, some cocktails, dinner plates, and coffee for dessert and it came out to about $125 per person.  I enjoyed the Bacon Wrap Dates, the Crab and Scallop Risotto, and coffee for dessert.  Attentive excellent wait staff that went above and beyond.   I would definitely come here again, especially with a large group when you aren't sure what everyone likes to eat (we had people visiting from all over the world and very different palates),as they have a diverse enough menu that everyone enjoyed it.   Only 4 stars because I felt like it was overpriced, and although the food was excellent, nothing was really out of the ordinary or inspired in any new way.  I would come again for the overall experience, not some specific meal or cocktail I had to have.",

    "text": "Disastrous... I would give zero stars if possible! Made my reservation 2 months ahead to celebrate my birthday, party of 4, 7:45 reservation. By 8:45 they still couldn't tell us how much longer until we could be seated... We had 1 round of drinks while waiting. They offered to get us another round on the house but then never showed up to follow through... Talked to manager, Scott.. What a sorry excuse of a manager.. He was completely clueless as to the mess he had going on... The couple in the bar next to us was upset that their reservation, likewise, was not honored..but they had only wasted 30 minutes of their time. Needless to say we left.. Difficult to find nice place on Saturday night w/o reservation.  Ended up at Delmonicos, which was very good. On a side note, since I can't rate any food- ladies' room was messy- bar area was filthy and tables askew, just plain sloppy.. We had to clear our own table to seat ourselves for the endless wait and then ask  for the table to be wiped. Waitress was sweet but did not have  sufficient knowledge of cocktails. Since I don't have any reason to give a good review it should also be noted that this place is very casual... We dressed for dinner, sports coats, dresses, and most patrons were in t-shirts and shorts- nothing wrong with that but we were under impression it was supposed to be more upscale...  Giada, this is a destination restaurant... One needs to take a cab....The Cromwell is not a place that most stay... Your people are not providing the services to the standard that I'm sure you are expecting.... Beyond disappointed that we took a cab to arrive in time for our reservation then had to cab back to take a chance on a walk-in... Shame on your staff for not at least comping our drinks and attempting to make it right... This restaurant will be 'no longer' in a short time.. The staff is completely inexperienced and ditzy.... Still angry !!  You Honor reservations!!!! And, good grief, iron your table cloths and clean your place up.... Sloppy sloppy sloppy.. Also, the arrogance of your staff- they stated , quote, the patrons were lingering.. My husband said it's been over an hour wait for our reservation and your gal said \"well, you would linger too if you had that table\"!!!! Whaaaaattt? Still in total shock-",

    "text": "Ok...Great new Hotel, Cromwell, my wife was excited to take me to lunch as she is a huge fan of all of Giada's cookbooks and shows.  We walked in at 145 on a Friday and were told there was wait which we were fine with and went to the bar...after running thru the wine list I ordered a white Burgundy (~$137) from the bartender who asked if we wanted to eat at the bar and I told him we were waiting on our table.  My wife joined me and asked if we could get an appetizer and the bartender said well I'll need to go get the menu that I just took away. (1). we waited 15 minutes and watched as tables emptied around the exterior windows which are where we wanted to sit.  I walked back to the hostess stand to check on our table and brought up we would be happy with any of the 6 tables that were open by the windows.  She said those were reserved for Dinner which would be opening at 4:30. (2) I promised we would not take 2 1/2 hours and would be as accommodating as possible.  She said she would let us know.  Walked back to join my wife at the bar, still no wine.(3) and the bartender(s) were now all congregated at the back of the bar....  Another 5 minutes and our Hostess greeted us at the bar and said our table was ready... I walked to the back of the bar and told our BT we were being seated...he gave me the receipt. Still no wine and said give it our hostess and she would handle. (4). the hostess then sat us in the bar area in the back by the kitchen completely on the other side from the window area.  I asked our hostess if we could sit and one of the empty 5 tables that I pointed out.  She said she would have to ask a manager. (5)  We then sat at a sofa chair area in front of the bar to wait for her manager.  After another 5 minutes my wife was really embarrassed as this was her big surprise for me to eat with her...and she said I'm sorry...we can go if you want to which I said...lets just wait 5 more minutes....I looked over at my bartender who was still at the back of the bar...I then looked at the now 6 empty tables and said to my wife lets go...  I walked back to my bartender and told him to cancel the white Burg and he started talking sideways that the SOM was coming(6) to which I said don't worry about it...We walked out to the hostess stand and told the Hostess to not worry about seating us to which she also said the manager would be right with us(7)... I was already on the escalator heading down and my wife told her it just wasn't worth it now.  Needless to say it was a disaster and I spent my $300 on lunch next-door.  I guess they forgot that there are hundreds of great spots in Vegas all vying for our hard earned money. So that was my story.....  It blew.",

    "text": "* Nice dining room. The Lunch service's music is not what you would expect though, Janice Joplin and Italian food don't really go together in my opinion. What was disappointing about the food was the lack of selection for vegans. I'm not saying everywhere should or would have a selection, but I picked this place because the website specifically listed that it was vegan friendly \"Vegan, gluten-free or dairy-free? Not a problem, just let your server know and they'll guide you through the menu options or whip you up something special, house-made gluten-free pasta included!\" When I told my server that I was vegan she asked me \"how vegan\" and then tried to tell me that this or that dish only had \" a little bit of cheese\". In the end I received the child size plain marinara pasta dish that left me still hungry and waiting for my friends to finish their lunches. If you don't have vegan options or don't want to put in any effort- please do not mention vegans on your website.",

    "text": "Lunch for 2:  As long-time local residents, we were eager to dine at Giada's but wanted to allow enough time for her to settle in after her grand opening; we decided on a mid-week lunch. I made our online reservation more than a week before our Wed afternoon visit only to find when we arrived our reservation was not in their system so, the hostess told us we would need to wait even though we arrived five minutes after they opened.  Our wait probably totaled 10 minutes - this would not have been an issue with us except we noticed as we were being led to our table that the restaurant appeared to be more than half empty - so why the wait? They seemed to have plenty of servers just standing around.  Why were we escorted to a table far from the windows when I had requested a table with a view of the Strip? Was it because we were locals? I requested one of the many empty tables along the windows - only to be placed at the very end which made a view of the Strip difficult. Now, unlike most of the patrons in the restaurant who I assume were vacationers based on the way they were dressed (shorts, sandals, t-shirts), we were dressed in business casual, certainly very respectful of any restaurant dress code. Moments after we were seated the manager stopped by our table for the obligatory introduction during which I let him know I was not happy with our visit thus far - he moved us to the table area we reserved in the first place.    Our total lunch order for 2 people = $56 (NO alcohol):  1) Wood Roasted Mushrooms w/ Toasted Marcona Almonds & Ricotta Salata - per menu =$13 (we were charged $14). First, the serving did NOT look anything like the picture on the Web site - much smaller, nowhere near as appetizing. The dish consisted of only a couple mushroom caps, mostly stems - several of which were tough and chewy, very little seasoning - not what I would call an actual \"dish.\"  Clearly, we were overcharged for such a tiny serving of mushrooms - mostly mushroom pieces.  2) Orzo Meatballs with Parmesan Pomodoro - per menu = $14 (we were charged $15). Again, a small bowl containing 4 tiny meatballs. Although the meatballs were moist the seasoning was on the bland side - nothing extraordinary and given the price not worth $3.75 per meatball, the size of each would fit neatly into a small teaspoon. Unremarkable at best. And, to add insult to injury, 5 hours after arriving home from our visit, the meatballs did not seem to settle well and stomach issues were the result.  3) Romaine Torn Croutons, Fried Capers & Citrus Caesar Vinaigrette Salad - per menu = $16 (this was the only item for which we were charged correctly). Bottom line: Giada should hire me to prepare her salads - mine are extraordinary in comparison. Her salad did not appear that fresh; it contained wilted, large, unevenly torn pieces of romaine lettuce that actually had small black specs running along the edges. The seasoning was so minimal it was nearly non-existent. The plate included one small mound of capers clumped to one side. In short, one of the worst salads I've ever had at a restaurant - especially a celebrity chef's restaurant - and considering the price, the poor quality was shocking; clearly, we were overcharged.  4) 1 cappuccino - good, basic, but at $7 certainly nothing special enough to warrant that price.  The Web site indicates patrons will enjoy a \"bread basket filled with home-made focaccia, lemon thyme flatbread and parmesan breadsticks.\"  We did not receive this version of the bread basket. Instead, we received a couple pieces of flatbread with a tiny bowl of bland pesto.   One observation we found amusing: Giada made sure her name is on everything - and I mean everything, from the cloth napkins, to the place mats, to the dishes - even to the hand towels in the bathroom. The only item I didn't see her name adoring (thank goodness) was the toilet paper.  Bottom line: Some of my worst meals in my fair city have been at the so-called \"celebrity chef\" restaurants (Todd English at City Center where we were served slimy fish & chips - at an exorbitant price, I might add - that I feared would send us to the ER; Wolfgang Puck's at Caesars where they snobbishly passed off tough, dry, tasteless mutton as though it were delicate lamb - among other celebrity chef disappointments...). This city boasts hundreds of wonderful restaurants - many of which are NOT located in the tourist-trap Strip hotels but rather in the neighborhoods where the locals go about their daily lives.   I was really expecting - and sincerely hoping - that Giada's would be one of the best gastronomical delights in this city - I truly was rooting for her. Although the service was attentive, the food quality and value fell way short of our expectations. With all the choices we have in this city, this isn't one I'd recommend.",

    "text": "Sorry to say that management deserved no stars. I love Giada and looked forward to dinner especially since the restaurant is upstairs away from the casino and prided super views. My husband and I booked early, requested a window seat but couldn't get a reservation till 9:45 a little late for us but took it with pleasure.   We are frequent Vegas visitors and always enjoy quality restaurants - so many excellent choices in town. We were told it was a $100. 00 minimum check for the window which was fine because the prices are high. A lovely room lots of windows and a view of the traffic!  We ordered salmon for my husband and rack of lamb for me with a broccoli side to share. Oh, just water to drink.  Then the manager began hovering over us imcomfortably as time passed. He asked if everything was OK before any thing was served,  then the nice bread selection came followed immediately by dinner. Timing was rather off and the veg side was cold. So the manager whisked it off and brought another cold side!  Tried again and finally got hot  veg.  The salmon was tasty and nicely cooked as was the lamb, but we had to ask for our water to be filled.  The manager  insisted we order dessert  ($100.00 minimum). So we ordered Lemon souffle  which was nice too but not very lemony   When the bill came,  well over &100.00 an $86.00 seat charge was added to our bill!  Appallingly poor practice for a good restaurant. The manager was rude and pompous and embarrassed us  tremendously.  He told us we signed for al fresco dining !  OK but we were inside!  After a lot of back and forth the charge was eventually removed. But the entire episode spoiled our evening. We're not the \"beautiful people\" we saw all around us, and we didn't order a huge meal with drinks but nevertheless we were paying customers and expected to be treated as such. I compclaimed to the general manager by E  Mail but heard nothing. So unless you spend  lots of money on drinks, starters etc.  don't expect any service. Very disappointed !",

    "text": "We tried Giada as some friends had gone and enjoyed it. I must say we were very disappointed. First off, the good points: The Service; it was outstanding from start to finish. The bacon wrapped dates were excellent. Now the rest: we were a party of 4 and were seated at a large round table meant for 6 so it was difficult to carry on conversation. The music was too loud, the whole restaurant was too loud IMHO and then to top it off, they opened up several of the garage door style windows so we could hear all the traffic noise on Flamingo. They don't have proper blinds and drapes to block out the sun which was setting so 2 people at our table were \"in the spotlight\". It was so bright you couldn't see and when we asked them to close the drapes to block the sun we were told they don't work that way but they are \"aware of the problem\".  The wine was very good but like everything else, way overpriced. We live in Vegas and we know the strip places are more expensive but the roasted chicken for 2 with 2 sides (everything is a la carte) came to $74. C'mon....this is chicken....actually it was more the size of a Cornish hen! The asparagus side was tough and stringy and luke warm. With one appetizer, the meal for 2, 2 glasses of wine, tax & tip it was $150 and, in our opinion, definitely NOT worth it. Giada is just another overpriced strip restaurant charging more for the name and location, certainly not the food. We will not go back and will not recommend it to others.",

    "text": "After a 2 month wait for a reservation we made it to giadas. Note: trying to get this reservation was not an easy task to begin with. Both my friend and myself called separately and spoke to someone extremely rude at their front desk. Like we owed them something just wanting to come there. In the end I called again and was connected to ceasars reservation line and a terrifically kind person helped. Enough about that. We arrived a bit late due to LV traffic Friday at 545 pm. They were very welcoming and seated us immediately at the best table in the house!  What a view!  All things the strip!!! Windows are open in the restaurant. Great atmosphere except a bit loud from street traffic, and the ambulances. But I still loved that part anyway. Four of us went.  We actually didn't order food for at least 1.25 hours later (we were talking so much it too us that long) and the waiter came over a lot but he wasn't pushing us at all. Ordered wine off a menu but they didn't have it any longer!  Shouldn't be on their then and the Somali (unsure of spelling) wasn't great at offering suggestions and made excuses why they only ordered one case of it to begin with. They found something else and she offered nothing to make up for it but the group did like my husband's choice. We finally ordered numerous appetizers. Pizzette (not great at all): some kind of three bean salad (excellent except Baruta cheese had odd flavor): Parmesan cheese (definitely not my favorite but never is): and dates in bacon (loved it and would order that again); the bread they give you came after we ordered those things and I think it should have been brought out when we first arrived but apparently they don't do that and we didn't ask). Frankly I didn't care I loved the tabke so much I could have just sat there not eating at all.  Then we ordered dinner and basically shared.  A lemon spaghetti with chicken (my friend who ordered it didn't love it, originally she was going to order an italian fish and probably should have gotten it): I ordered a tortellini dish with peas, a yellow sauce and pancetta (which we ordered on the side for all things kosher), very good, a whole chicken with a delicious catchatori sauce on the side ...very yummy chicken was perfect, and their lamb excellent.  Service was good and all staff seemed so happy there (but could have been better by the wine lady and even the waiter but he was ok too.  Dessert then was offered at 6$ for each taking and we did,  cookies (choclate chip, a peanut butter and jelly and  lemon iced cookie); a chocolate Grenache (small and rich); something called nipples (my husband had to have that..chocolate inside, with white chocolate on outside 3 small ones); and something the waiter loved kind of like a small cookie with strawberries in top and they called a tomato something or other (not great).  In fact all the desserts were beautiful but in all honesty not fantastic by any means. I forgot to mention the men also ordered cocktails which were recipes of giadas grandfather and they liked those. At one point the manager came over to say hello. He didn't introduce himself and he didn't come with 3 feet of the table. It was weird and unimpressive but wanted to know if we liked the place and quickly scurried away. Anyway the meal was fun and interesting. Dinner ran close to $550 with tip. It was very expensive I thought but for me personally that view was worth the whole thing. Id tell people to go try it for themselves. I really wanted to try it but don't need to return unless it's for lunch with girlfriends for a fun and good atmosphere. You can go there we found without reservation and sit in bar first come first serve. The restaurant was full and maybe we got that table as we asked for a view ahead and are locals. Who knows but if I sat somewhere else I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much though the entire decor is really nice but we weren't facing the restaurant..the strip the fountains ceasars, flamingo road, fabulous!",

When we arrived at 6:50 for our 7:00 reservation we were told that it would only be a few minutes till our table was ready. Unfortunately they did not seat us until 7:20 which I could look past barbecue we had fun in the photo booth in the lobby. I had requested (a month in advance) a window seat looking out to the Strip, but we were escorted to a table next to the bar away from the main dining room. I asked if they were able to honor my request and they said that the restaurant was full and we would have to wait another 30-40 minutes to be seated over there by the windows. We declined since it was already 7:30 at this point and were all hungry. Fast forward to the service: Our waiter was very nice yet slightly disconnected and informed us to stick with the cocktails on the iPad and not to venture off. The food came out fast and was very good overall and very inventive as you would expect from a Giada \"crafted\" Menu. When it came time for desert we were told we would have to wait about 10 minutes for the cart to come over so we could see the daily offering which at first I thought it was a really cool concept. What wasn't cool is after waiting 10 minutes the cart came over looking very sparse with very little to choose from. We picked a few items out and felt very underwhelmed with the taste compared to the looks. Overall we had an OK experience. Perhaps it was to early on and they were working out the bugs.

    "text": "Atmosphere was amazing, servers were nice but set expectation on portion sizes after both \"entrees\" were ordered. Stated the portions were meant for multiple offerings, which is fine. I just would have liked an overview before I dived into the menu. They started off by telling us they were out of several items. Checked in on Yelp for free glass of prosecco like the table next to us. They split theirs for the two of them, only one for us like the offer said.   Chicken Marsala meatballs was ok, wouldn't get again since I wasn't blown away. Roman Caprese was a highlight.  Lobster ravioli was ok. Tiramisu was good.    I have eaten at many restaurants and I think my biggest disappointment here was being over hyped by a celebrity chef just due to the name on the wall.",

    "text": "Our first time here and we enjoyed it very much.  We did have low expectation due to the fact we got mixed reviews from friend and through OpenTable and Yelp but we would like to come back again to try other dishes and lunch.   We got chicken Marsala meatballs which was very flavorful and good.   Shared a Romaine salad, which was good on its own but delicious when we tried it with the crispy cheese cracker thing that came with freshly baked rosemary bread.  We shared fettuccini with pork ragu, veal chop saltimbocca and lemon potato for main.   Pasta was a bit over cooked and wished it was more al dente since they served fresh pasta. The ragu sauce was excellent and even with the soft pasta we got, enjoyed the flavor very much. Portion for pasta would be on the smaller side but well enough for a light eater or should have it with half salad.     Oh the veal... it was so delicious!! The saltiness from the cheese and prosciutto went very well with the crispy breadcrumb and savory veal. Perfection.   Lemon potatoes, not too overpowered by the lemon flavor, went well with our pasta and veal.   Dessert: lemon souffle with gelato  was heavenly and white coffee gelato was to die for!!   Overall we slightly over ordered in portion. Could have done without the meatballs and still had enough food.   Servers was very knowledgeable and friendly.   Can't wait to go back again.",

Every single thing we ate was incredible and full of flavor. I was concerned about the portions being so small for the 2 of us but by the end my husband and I were plenty full + more. The dessert cart is something to remember. So many choices! We each choose 3 different desserts.. all were very good. Be prepared to spend a lot of $ here. Although in the end, your paying for great food and service. The background music is upbeat and the decor is gorgeous. You can tell Giada's restaurant is really thought out.

I actually had pretty low expectations for whatever reason but (at least for breakfast) I can say it's got a lot going for it. First, it's a stunning restaurant in a stunning hotel (The Cromwell). It has huge windows that overlook the Bellagio fountains and if you get a good seat next to the window you can relax here for a while if they let you.   The coffee is top notch, the chia parfait is amazing. Really just refreshing and delicious. I could eat that every single day. I tried one of their frittatas and it was expertly prepared, moist and flavorful. Not my usual experience with frittatas. Also the prices are reasonable (for the strip). This may be my new favorite strip breakfast spot.",

We started with the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, and although I've had many before, these dates were scrumptious. My dish was a lemon lobster ravioli which was fine; I was expecting more bold flavor. But surprisingly, the star of the evening was the orange mocha. The best dessert coffee I have ever had. It's made with their house made orange syrup. I can't believe the coffee is what impressed me most. So much so, that my husband and I are going back to Giada's today, just for the coffee before we leave town.   Overall, a very enjoyable experience.",

Everything I asked for when I made the reservation was accommodated. I asked for a table with a view and that we are celebrating our anniversary. We had a great view of the strip and Lauren sure made our anniversary dinner special.   We had the Giada and La Strada cocktails ($15 each). The La Strada was really good. We are not huge drinkers so it helped that it was not strong and it was on the sweet/fruity side. I also had a raspberry iced tea ($6, free refills).   The complimentary bread service was full of variety. It was fun and tasted great. Love the fried capers. The starters we ordered, Orzo Meatballs ($15) and Crab Crostini ($17) were good, not great. I've had better meatballs and crab toast else where. The pasta course however was great. The Spaghetti with Shrimp ($34) was my favorite dish of the night. I have a weakness for fresh made pasta. Flavors popped from the perfectly seasoned al dente pasta. The Crab and Scallop Risotto ($32) was perfectly cooked. I've had my share of poorly cooked risotto so it was refreshing to see they got it right here. The scallops that came with it were not overcooked and it was perfectly seasoned.  For the main course, we had the Chicken Cacciatore for two ($58). It was basically fried chicken with tomato sauce. I'm glad the sauce comes on the side because the chicken came crispy and had a really flavorful spice rub on it. I actually prefer it without the sauce.  For dessert I really wanted the souffle but the kitchen didn't want to make it since it was close to closing. This was really the only thing that kept our night from being perfect. We ended up getting the Lambic Float ($18) which wasn't very good. Lauren did send out some cookies with Happy Anniversary written on the plate which was really nice of her to cap our night off.",

    "text": "\"I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.\" -- Giada quote etched into the light fixtures above the dining room. I guess that's justification for the small portions. The other harbinger for our dismal dining experience was the tray of seasonings brought out with the bread plate. The food should be seasoned by the chef, not the diners.  BARBARELLA: This cocktail was similar to an adult lemonade. I enjoyed the basil accents and the rather large glass, but it's not worth $15. WOOD ROASTED MUSHROOMS: Menu says this comes with roasted Marcona almonds and ricotta salata. They were basic mushrooms, but the thin cheese slices were a nice touch. No almonds were present. GRILLED OCTOPUS: Charred exterior but slightly overcooked and no seasoning whatsoever. Had to ask for lemon, which was embarrassing. Texture seemed to have been boiled to cook and then grilled to add blistering. Disappointing. PECORINO TARTUFO: the cheese course suggested by our server, plated with apricot preserves. A highlight! Great salty richness to the cheese with a hint of a truffle crust, the sweetness of the fruit was a good complement. But when the cheese course is one of your most memorable dishes, you're in trouble. \"SPICY ITALIAN SAUSAGE ARANCINI\": The name and description are laughably misleading. There is no sausage in this dish, server insisted it's in the risotto crust. Spice flavor was extremely slight. There's no reason whatsoever for the name to reference sausage if it's basically ricotta(?) cheese sticks with marinara sauce. Two thumbs down. ROASTED BABY BEET SALAD: This was fine. Beets and goat cheese on a bed of frisee with a light dressing and some pepitas. Not bad but nothing different here. STEAK TENDERLOIN CROSTINI: A surprise hit! Good balance of flavors between the thin-cut tenderloin and a mustard-esque sauce and some pickled veggies. Thick, crisp base. Seems to be a newer offering in this category. COLD PEA SOUP: Completely unbalanced. Tasted like pure pureed peas, had hoped for a delicate, subtle pea flavor offset by the pancetta... but it was not. Too bold, too forceful, no restraint, would not get again. BACON WRAPPED DATES: Smoky, sweet, and a touch spicy. That's how this dish is supposed to play out, and it does, briefly. Then the sweetness overwhelms. Rather large portion compared to other dishes here, 6 pieces. I liked the bleu cheese crema, wish there was more of it. LEMON POTATOES: Crispy \"smashed\" and fried potatoes. Nice blanket of cheese atop the order, nicely done, and the portion goes farther than you'd think. SPAGHETTI: I don't care for the pronunciation guide for the pasta portion of the menu, but the spaghetti was decent. Attractively plated with two large and tasty shrimp and a small nest of pasta and a lemony cream sauce similar to an alfredo. As many other reviews state, $34 is a bit much for this dish. Compared to the original menu, the price has risen $6 in the past year.  LEMONCELLO SOUFFLE: This was the dessert suggested by our server. It's presented tableside with a scoop of buttermilk gelato, which is placed atop the souffle to melt into the dish. I liked the lemon flavors of the souffle, but only the topmost portion was cooked to the light, airy style characteristic of a souffle. Rather than having a gooey center, the entire bottom half of the dish seemed to be a gritty, soupy (though tasty) mess, which wasn't helped by the melted gelato.  SERVICE. Our server was polite, and suggested a few great dishes. The two-top tables for couples are small, and the plates are large, and we ordered a lot. Our table filled up quick, yet none of the bussers or servers removed our unused wine glasses, unnecessary bread plates, etc. Toward the end of our meal, service improved. It appeared our server had our table, along with another couple, in addition to a party of 10, which was a bit much for one person to handle.  After waiting a year to experience Giada's restaurant, our dining experience was disappointingly subpar. The menu and dish descriptions are precisely our style, but many of the dishes received did not match what we were led to expect- multiple dishes were missing ingredients and others lacked seasoning altogether. Though there are a few unique dishes here (no small feat in Vegas!), too many have better versions elsewhere on the Strip.",

    "text": "We went here wondering a bit because of the variety in what the reviews had to say...   Our experience was a 10 star one from start to finish. We were a group of 4 celebrating an important birthday. The hostess who greeted us was very upbeat and professional.   Our waiter Valentino was Fabulous!!  He was always ready to make a suggestion or help in any way & was not at all intrusive. He delivered us Such a nice professional dining experience along with the team which smoothly helped him. We would absolutely request him in the future.   The view which we included in photos was vibrant & picture perfect!  The restaurant is very chic & sophisticated.  As Norm pointed out there is the Giada signature everywhere or her signature G. I thought it was a great detail, although it is understandable if one were having a bad experience the Giada signature would most likely make ya crazy.   We ordered the tasting menu, which was Perfect! It was a taste blast from start to finish. The lamb I had was for sure the best I have Ever tasted & there was no mint jelly, which normally would be frustrating to me.  In this case the sauce they presented it with was so Fabulous that the 3 people who ordered lamb & wanted mint jelly, actually preferred Guada's flavor & sauce. Their lamb is absolutely amazing. The other entree was a filet. It was very very good, but the lamb was the show stopper!!!  Appetizer antipasto.  Beyond fabulous.    Valentino suggested we order one of each of the pastas which was a great suggestion. The portions of pasta we all agreed were a little on the too small size.  Delicious, just not quite enough to go around.   There was a creamed corn dish which is something you should taste.  One guest wanted to lick the bowl.  Lol.   The wine list was a little pricey, but there were a couple lovely choices at reasonable prices.  One Malbac was $75 & in doing a quick wine check, it was only a double up.  Some of the wines were triple mark-ups so you might use a wine price web check sire or do a quick Google check.   Deserts were included. Everyone got 3 choices. Happy Birthday was hand written in chocolate on the birthday girl's plate.  Deserts were very nice & more than a generous portion.   Valentino brought us a complimentary elderberry liqueur to finish our night. It was very unique in a great way.   We loved Giada\"s from start to finish it was an experience which over delivered. Way beyond our hopes for a great night.",

Make sure to take a pic while you wait for your table. The place is gorgeous: upscale and modern with a beautiful view of the strip. We ordered the chicken marsala meatballs ($14), savory waffle ($18), and gnocchi ($17). Everything was pretty good but the best dish had to be the meatballs. They were salty, flavorful and the sauce was marsala wine sauce was heavenly!!! On top of that, our server was excellent and knew so much about the dishes and how they are made. Overall, a good place to have a fancy brunch but I'd skip the savory waffle, it's not worth the $18. The meatballs are a must try though!",

The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We ordered the bruschetta (my personal favorite) and meatballs to start. Then my mom ordered the lemon pasta and shrimp and I ordered the risotto and scallop. When the waiter informed me that they had run out of scallops, they served me large shrimp instead and it was still so delicious! They were also very apologetic. The atmosphere is very welcoming and I love the special touches, from the plates to the lighting fixtures. Just an all-around great dining experience!",

The dining area is big but I'm assuming,  since it's pretty new, the staff is still training so they can't max out the tables seated.   The brunch menu was pretty small but we still ended up ordering a ton to try the items.   Appetizer: burrata.  The cheese was creamy and tasty but this glob of cheese was served by itself. At least give some bread slices or crackers with it!  Had to ask the waitress for bread and she wasn't even sure if they had bread in the kitchen. Um what?   Main course:   The pepperoni flatbread was pretty tasty with a thick crust and ooey cheese.  Their \"popular\" lobster roll was served open face and contained huge chunks of lobster but it was lacking a tangy zang to make the flavors pop.   Dessert was her trio of cookies that were chocolate chip, chocolate fudge, and lemon.  These were the best thing we had!! The cookies were warm and super flavorful.  I'm hoping this restaurant gets a bit better because the views of the strip from up here are amazing.",

The food and service are good, however I cannot justify $25-$36 for pasta. With drinks and tip, dinner for two can easily cost close to $200.

We heard they were very strict with the business or dressy dress code so we prepared in advance. Once here my boyfriend noticed his dress shirt had a cut along the lapel so he had only his tees and had no time to shop for another shirt. He didnt want us to miss out so suggested he will play cards and wait while we eat, Upon coming up the gorgeous staircase to the hostess stand I saw a family going down from the restaurant wearing very casual clothing ( sneakers, jeans etc ) so I asked the hostess if it was ok for him to come in with us and she was super sweet and said of course! So we got to eat together! So yay!  The food portions are a little smaller but still very filling not to mention everything was so good! Very flavorful and my goodness the wait staff was perfect! Very friendly and knowledgeable and attended to our every needs!  Definitely recommended!",

It was not a welcoming environment. The staff looked either bored or annoyed. Our server put on a very disingenuous smile as he encouraged us to all order the tasting menu, which looked good but had no price listed. My friend had researched the menu prior to arriving, so we knew what we wanted to order, which was a variety of about 7 appetizers, two salads, and two pastas, as we were all interested in sampling several things. The waiter seemed very put out that we were ordering that way. The food was decent, but definitely nothing I would go out of my way to have again, sadly. We were all really looking forward to this. (**I forgot I hadn't finished this review and it was in my draft folder, so this is actually from June 2017. Hopefully, they've gotten their act together since then, but I won't be giving them a second shot. Too many other places in Vegas to try.)",

    "text": "Giada's restaurant is freshly opened in the Cromwell boutique hotel. It's been a long-time coming. The menu is what I would consider to be Italian-Californian, serving dishes that are Italian at their core and highlighting fresh California flavors.  For my first visit I tried several things to get a feel for the quality of the food and the ingredients being used.  The marinated olives to start were fantastic. These were light and refreshing and the lemon zest (her signature) was a nice touch.  For the main course we split the margherita pizzette, orecchiette pasta, and the caprese salad. We ended the meal with the zeppole to share and these were surprisingly light and served with nutella which added a nice touch.   The nutella was shaped in the form of a letter G, lest you forget for two seconds where you are. The Giada brand is literally everywhere: on your napkins, on your plates, and in your food. I washed my hands in the restroom and dried them with Giada-branded towelettes. It's a little much.  The portions are small which if you know anything about Giada was to be expected. Her motto tends to be 'a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything', with great emphasis on the last part.  Beyond that, my main sticking point is that the quality was definitely a little lacking, if not misleading.  The caprese salad claimed to be made with buffalo mozzarella. I'm Italian from the same region as Giada and buffalo mozzarella has a bit of a tang and is normally a little softer; this was very bland and dry. Places like Obica in LA import mozzarella and burrata from Italy and that is the real deal with the right taste and consistency. For $19 I got halved cherry tomatoes with cheese that was definitely not made of buffalo's milk as claimed.   In terms of food pacing, the dough and the sauce on the pizza were great but the cheese was already hardening when the meal was brought out, like it'd been sitting around for a bit. The pasta appeared to be homemade, although when it was brought out it was a bit tepid. There seem to be some inconsistencies between the kitchen and the service staff.   Overall it was a decent meal but for almost a $100 the food should have been of a higher quality and executed more professionally.   The food here is beautifully prepared in a lovely setting but I expected perfect Italian quality and taste and didn't feel that was delivered.",

    "text": "First I LOVE GIada's shows and the persona she gives off on tv and my girlfriends all know I'm a foodie.  I was running late so we ended up sitting in the bar/lounge area which was perfect for us to catch up and eat good food.  We sat there for over 2 hrs chitt chatting before heading out to a lounge and the rest.  The lighting was perfect not too dark and not too bright, the noise level in the area we sat was Fantastic.  Our waitress was spot on and of course beautiful like a dainty pixie fearie, but it is Vegas after all, no Fugly people in a high end place like this. lol  *well it's True* not to sound..umm arrogant like I guess.  So we ordered a few things and it was filling. We got :  Caponata - this was nice and tangy and portion perfect.  Peppers sliced- they brought out this app. and accidently we though this was their version of caponata, which was way off base of course..lol    Sweet stuffed peppers- very plump juicy and tasty  Arugula salad - very peppery tasting as arugula should be and fresh like right from the back yard.  We shared the Salmon entree which they kindly split for use and the portion was perfect. The salmon was good, but the actual sauce with I think shitake mushroom or something?? Was TO DIE FOR!    We had a Chocolate Budino just to try some kind of dessert and it was good with pistachio, but I wanted to also try the Apple Tart, but they just ran out of it.  My girl doesn't really drink and I was also driving so club soda and splash of cran for me please. lol  Besided I don't do girlie fufu drinks anyways and this is NOT a place to be drinking straight shot 151's and blue Lamborghini's and get trashed. :-) I say that for Drai's or Tao. hahaha    This place was worth it and not snooty, but reflected Giada's personality on tv all the way and was elegant.  It was not expensive at all and I was shocked at how affordable it was. Cheaper than the Cellar. What??!!!   Ofcourse it's not your white castle prices..lol but some place to go to if you want a nice dinner and some intimate time with friends or significant others.   I sooo want to go back and try about 6 things, which when I go back in May I will do just that.    This placeuse to be the old Barbary Coast, now called the Cromwell, which kind of gives me what I would say is a James Bond kind of atmosphere, though a bit small.   This should be a go to place, especially since Giada's not known for her having eateries like Lagassie or Bobby Flay, and her place is WAY better IMO.    All in all, I'm looking forward to going back with our group of friends when we meet up, since several will be coming from out of town as well.    Go GIada!",

    "text": "Giada's had a ton of hype ever since it opened this past summer. Reservations had to be booked two months in advance. Expectations were high when I finally tried the food last weekend with a high probability of disappointment (as is usually the case with these types of celebrity restaurants). The menu is naturally Italian cuisine, but with Californian influences.   We started with a few appetizers: the orzo meatballs, the lobster arancini, and the wood roasted mushroom pizzette. The orzo meatballs were a heavy favorite on reviews, but I found them to be ordinary. The lobster arancini was a huge failure. While it was well-coated and fried, the name was quite deceiving. There was no lobster at all - no chunks of meat, no flavor of lobster whatsoever, not even imitation meat. I thought I was mistaken from the first ball, but by the time I bit into the second, I was sure there was no lobster. I love mushrooms so the wood roasted mushroom pizzette was my favorite appetizer. It was topped with gorgonzola, which didn't overwhelm the mushrooms.   When at Giada's, forget about the mains because the pasta is the star of the show. We shared the pappardelle and bucatini. The handmade pasta was perfectly cooked. Now, that's what I call al dente! The pork ragout was tender and flavorful, but I really liked the bucatini's spicy red sauce. I enjoyed both pastas, but the bucatini was a slight favorite.   Get used to high prices for small portions when dining on The Strip. Each appetizer was 4 ounces each and each pasta dish was 8 ounces. Surprisingly, I was comfortably full after the pastas so we skipped out on dessert. I wasn't blown away by the food (especially not the appetizers), but I could appreciate the pasta dishes. The space itself has great views of the Bellagio fountains and Caesar's. I also love restaurants that have an open kitchen where you can watch them prepare everything from the pasta to even the charcuterie.",

Don't misunderstand me - I have eaten at Le Cirgue, Prime, Delmonico's, Wynn Country Club, STK, Jaleo, Hugo's Cellar, Estiatorio Milos, CarneVino, Bazaar Meats, The Steakhouse, Golden Steer, Emeril's New Orleans Fish House, ect -  I don't mind paying good money for a good meal, just don't like being ripped off and leave hungry. I wont even mention the price for cocktails and wine. $$$$$$$ I will never be back and sorry we even gave it a shoot -  A complete rip off for a supposed Italian Restaurant but was Tapas !!!Buyer Beware!!!",

Our waiter was Radoslav and he really knows how to represent the food. We started with two appetizers - lobster rolls and Borgata cheese, for the main meal he recommended Veil and Salmon with cauliflower and broccoli on the side. We never tasted so tender and flavory food- amazing. But wait for the deserts- way beyond our expectations - best tiramisu ever. We had such a great experience there and we truly recommend this place!   Every little detail is placed with love and good taste. Thank you Radoslav for making our dinner so unforgettable! There is a lot more to say, but If you are looking for a luxury place with professional serves Giada is the One!",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant with a great view.  Wish the food and service matched the decor.  I was looking for some dairy free food, so I picked the breakfast Americana.  Basic stuff like eggs, potatoes, toast, side of meatballs?  Ok it's an Italian joint.  I was last to get my food not including my husband sending his pizza back because the egg was way overdone.  But really didn't get to enjoy anything beacuse of the total lack of sevice.  People might want salt and pepper, why shakers are not on the table beats the hell outta me.        So my meal is cold, flavorless, toast burnt to shit.  The waitress comes by to ask me if I'm done.  For f*cks sake I haven't even started, I ask for salt and pepper.  I get little boats I guess I'm supposed to pinch or pour on my food, it came with random hair in it, and now I'm done.        Total garbage service after we didn't upsell to sparkling water.  We wanted non-alcoholic drinks but she never took our drink order.  I was able to sneak in a coffee request only because I asked for it with my food.  It was the wrong drink though.  They use Lavassa coffee the same crap as the movie theaters.  This is just not living up to the hype.  By the way, they'll add a tip to a party of six and run away when they drop off the bill although a party of six next to us was able to get separate checks.  I can't recommend this place and I won't be back.",

Then pasta appetizer was lemon spaghetti which was al dente, bland and dry. My husband had fregolotto which was mushy but he ate it. Main course showed up and looked nice. Lamb was good but sides were mushy and unrecognizable too. He had tenderloin with gnocchi and carrots. Not impressive. No waitress in sight ever checked on us.

Our table was not ready, which is fine, but let us know and offer to seat us at the bar for a cocktail. When our table was finally ready the hostess came to the bar and told us to close out our tab. After we did so we could not find the hostess to seat us. We finally found her and was escorted to a boring table tucked in the back. Once we sat down, we were presented with a really cool souvenir with Giada's picture and some recipes. My friend was super excited, since she is such a big fan. At some point during the meal, it was cleared from the table. No token for us. The food was ok, but I was a little surprised that it wasn't better. We had bacon wrapped dates, octopus and bucatini. The octopus was a little bland, but the bucatini on the other hand was ridiculously spicy. There were some things we did like ... the bread is fabulous, the view from the restaurant overlooks the strip and the drinks were really good. At the end of the day, there is a restaurant here in Austin with a similar menu called Red Ash and it runs circles around Giada's. Maybe they were having an off night? :(",

Some really good wines available by the glass, I'm not too familiar with Italian wines the the bartender helped me choose a couple that I really ended up liking.

The service  was great and the girls behind the bar were sweet.  Unfortunately like almost all bartenders I encounter in Vegas they seemed a little jaded and who can blame them.  People come to Vegas and get on there worst behavior.  There where rude customers sitting on both sides of us.

The menu is a little overwhelming and the \"tasting menu\" seems like too much food and besides, it's crazy expensive!  They want you to order 1-2 starters, then soup or salad, then pasta, then a main course. The two of us skipped the main course, did not order sides, and we were still absolutely stuffed!!!  We LOVED the spaghetti in lemon cream sauce with shrimp. It was by far our favorite. We also loved the crab risotto with scallops, the romaine salad, and the chicken Marsala meatballs. The crab and artichoke dip was not our favorite.   Giadas was definitely a \"special occasion\" place. We requested window seats and we had a great view of the bellagio fountains. A beautiful place for a romantic dinner. Expensive, but worth it!",

Then she argued with us when we told her we didn't receive our appetizer and said she thought we ordered something else.  Asked for the manager on duty and this guy was so pompous.  We had to wait 10 minutes for him to reach our table.

The chicken meatballs were the worst as dry and needing a soak in the Marsala sauce once halved to be palatable. The eggplant lasagna had a wonderful pink sauce which made this the best plate. Two salads were both about average for a normal California fusion restaurant. Not sure what the vision for this restaurant is? If you want the big dollar menu for expense accounts, then the food experience needs to be increased considerably. If you're making a casual Italian lighter fare food, then the menu needs to be a bit more unique that what I can order at California Pizza Kitchen or cut the prices to match the mediocre experience. My overall opinion was I came once and that was enough. Our waitress disappeared after we ordered until we got the bill. Or actually, she  was around helping larger parties but not us. Thanks to the guy who came by with our entrees and had to go get us plates (leaving the hot food sitting  to get cold while we waited) and finally gave us a water refill that we'd waited for since we sat down parched. Nice water pitcher, but need way bigger glasses perhaps if refills are so hard to come by.",

Unappetizing when the other tables had to get up and we had a great view of their bums. Tables were way too close. Very uncomfortable being so close to other tables.   Once I told the waiter we didn't need the wine list he didn't even offer us a drink from the bar. We had to ask. BTW, the drinks are way over priced even for Vegas.   I had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and could not eat the shrimp as they tasted off.  Best part if the meal was the bread course.   I will not be going back...sorry Giada expected more from you.",

He made some great recommendations and knew what he was talking about, which is helpful.  He first brought an iPad to browse some starter items, but its response time was fairly slow so it was a bit on the useless side. I saw others a little befuddled by it as well. The a la carte menu had lots to choose from. Many options for everyone. I chose the salmon and was not disappointed at all. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was great.  The bread board was fantastic and has all unique items like crunchy bread sticks, and a lemony bread loaf as well as some crispy flat bread.  Everything has an Italian name to it, obviously, so I don't quite recall them, but the squid and shrimp starter was fantastic as well  Overall, this was a great dining experience with a great view of the Bellagio. I definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in a unique dining experience.",

Once at the table, we were served one piece of bread and those same plates of dips?! Ordered Spaghetti with two jumbo shrimp. The pasta was underwhelming and lacked flavor, and I couldn't chew threw the tough shrimp. The desert was the best part of my dinner. Nice raspberry cheesecake, it was simply the best!

My wife had the burger and added an egg and bacon, which cost a little more. The burger was large, juicy, and flavorful. I had the salmon cakes and Eggs Benedict. It was outstanding. The salmon cakes were crispy on the outside and moist and well seasoned inside. It came with perfectly poached eggs and a velvety, lemony Hollandaise. But the rest of the tasting menu was unremarkable. The antipasto consisted of bland looking and bland tasting ham and a few chunks of a chalky, dense Parmesan. A pastry stuffed with lemon curd and blueberries and lemon muffin were good, but it was not something I would have ordered a la carte. The Caesar salad was sour from too much vinegar. The desserts were pretty, but horrible. I had an chocolate espresso ice cream cake. The ice cream filling and chocolate sauce were very good, but the cake itself was dry and so coarse that it ruined the overall dish. My wife had a lemon souffle with creme anglaise. It was eggy and tasteless. We did not finish them. Fortunately, the decor, the service, and the main course were enough to make us consider coming back. But I would stick with the main course or order appetizers more to our liking, and I would probably skip the desserts.",

The ambience was superb. I honestly thought it was going to more Italian-y but it exceeded my expectation of decor. So modern , simple yet complex, and my favorite part was her pieces of art I have see in her cooking shows. I felt like I was in her kitchen aka a dream. 10/10 for ambience !   The food was amazing ! A lot of people give this place only one or 2 stars because the portion size but if you are a True Giada fan you would appreciate more of the experience. The food is very favorful in so many ways. The service was awesome thanks to our server Valentino. I'm bummed we didn't get to see her even though she has been here in Vegas all weekend for food event ! But anyways , I will definitely be back with my SIL and I'll bring my other girlfriends experience what we did.",

I mentioned to the Manager as a Manager Myself when My employees make a Mistake it is my Job to Correct or find a solution to problem.  My husband informed him we would be contacting you and putting a complaint on the restaurant and a Yelp Review and the manager still had to have a say, \"WELL MAKE SURE TO SPELL MY NAME CORRECTLY WHEN YOU DO\"   Like at that point I felt very disrespected was it because we are hispanic and he wasn't that he started of the conversation off by \"Can't you read' and finished it off with \"make sure to spell correctly\"  Giada's is my favorite restaurant and we usually eat here more than 1 during our 10 day stay, but with this kind of treatment and experience, I am considering if I should ever go back",

I started off with a couple of cheese plates to wet my whistle.The Gorgonzola with pears and honey was a perfect trio,a little bit of all three and you have a perfect bite.Pecorino tartufo was the other cheese plate I sampled and it came with apricot and a side of arugula which complimented the bold and spicy cheese.For my main I ordered the Salmon cake Benedict,spinach with piquillo peppers on the bottom,salmon crab cakes in the middle and then topped with two poached eggs cooked perfectly.As  I bit in all the flavors flowed like a conductors wand. This was one of the best brunches I've had in years.  The restaurant has a hip and modern upscale vibe but with comfortable furnishings that give it that homely feel.It also has a great window view of the strip.The server and the hostess were okay and would of given this place a five if it wasn't for them. And that's my take on Giana's place,Peace out.",

I'm not sure how the dinner is here, but my husband and I enjoyed our brunch!  I loved the decor of this restaurant. It was much bigger than I expected, with a huge open floor plan and large windows, offering a nice view of the strip.  We ordered the Sunrise Polenta Waffle and Italian Chicken & Waffle (we sure love our waffles!) The waffles were delicious, but without the maple syrup and bechamel sauce, the Sunrise Polenta Waffle was lacking in flavor--it would've helped if there was more than just tiny bits of pancetta. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the fried chicken was delicious--crispy skin with tender meat.   Service was great. The hostess was friendly and our waiter was attentive. We were able to get a free glass of prosecco with our Yelp check-in! We also took advantage of the photobooth.  The price of the dishes weren't cheap, but we still enjoyed our food and thought the portions were pretty big. We were really stuffed, and ended up having to box a large piece of chicken along with half a waffle. There are tons of spots in Vegas I have yet to try, but I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try out other dishes for brunch.",

    "text": "The experience at Giada's was exceptional. My grandmother is a HUGE HUGE fan of Gaida, so I took her there for a meal of a lifetime. My grandmother was savoring every bite (so was I).   So here's what you should do if you go to Giada's. Come with three people, because her tasting menu ($125/person, the price is worth it don't worry)has three items per course. This way you can taste her whole tasting menu which is a great way to try a little of a lot.   They start you with an amazing antipasti plate, which is killer. If you check in through Yelp you get a free glass of Prosecco, yeah! They were nice enough to give my grandmother one on the House because she didn't have Yelp. They also have a great wine list.   The pasta was amazing and the second course, my favorite was her Lemon Shrimp pasta. Just so simple and delicious.  The Third course consisted of different kinds of protein. The chicken was so good and crispy, and the Salmon was out of this world.   The best part of this tasting menu is the Dessert. They have a cart they bring up to the table and you get to pick three items a person! It was incredible. In total we had nine different desserts and they were all spectacular.   On top of all the wonderful dishes, the staff were very educated on all the ingredients and dishes, incredibly nice, and provided exceptional service. If I had it in my budget, I'd go every year.",

    "text": "Food:  Above average Italian and fine dining.  The portion size is very small, but I think that's OK.  The presentation and selection of dishes were very, very good.  Price is a bit on the high side - but for a swanky restaurant on the Strip it's expected.  Prices are also well advertised, so don't claim shock when you visit.  Ambiance: Above average ambiance.  We had a private room (loud and obnoxious party who needs to be separated from others), and it was adequate.  The overall look and feel of the restaurant is very nice.  Service:  For me, service is the most important aspect of a fine dining experience.  Unfortunately, it was very, very poor during our party's meal.  During the meal and entree service, not once was any individual asked for drink preferences or orders.  My water was never refilled over the period of 2.5 hours we were in the room.   Why was it a 2.5 hour dinner you may ask?  The main reason is that we were basically held hostage for 1.5 hours after the dinner while the staff sorted out the check.  I've never been part of such a thing - and I had to leave the private room to seek assistance three times to attempt to find out what was going on.    Once the check (finally) arrived, it was quite disappointing to find out that at least one extra bottle of wine had been added, and perhaps 4-5 side dishes and appetizers for a grand total of around $200 in over charge.  By that time the group was very anxious to leave and the remaining members of the party just had to agree to overpay in the thought that any further obstacles would have resulted in more of an insane wait time.  One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  It took *forever*, we were overcharged, and the service was nowhere to be found when needed.",

Our waiter Billy (William) was attentive, friendly, accommodating, and all the other things that a spectacular member of a fantastic team should be. Billy contributed to making this one of the most eventful and memorable experiences so far.",

I've have been several times, and each time I have had the Sangria there is two kinds the white and the red, I definitely recommend trying each to see which one you prefer best, they are both good but in my option I like the red one a lot more.   The food is always amazing we've had the flatbread and many small plates and they are all very delicious with so much great flavor.   I will definitely be stopping by to get some Sangria (red) next time I am in town.",

Slow, inattentive, and didn't deliver on promises. We had to ask twice for bread, and the courses came out with large delays in between.   All in all, not worth the money.",

Sarah was excellent in both her service, attentiveness, and personality.  She was so helpful and welcoming without being cheesy or fake.    The quality of the charcuterie board is amazing.  While you might think that cured meat and cheese can only be so good, I have been completely surprised each of the times I have ordered it here.  The quality of the meats is fabulous, as are the quality of the cheeses, jams, and mustards.  This comes with a price as a small order is $31.  We ordered a large last time and it was lovely.    We also ordered several pastas and all were excellent, but truthfully, not life changingly good.  The risotto had more scallops and crab meat than rice!  So delicious.  I love risotto and actually wished there was more rice.  First world problems.    What's even better is their kids' meal.  For $11 each, my kids ordered sausage pizza and chicken strips.  Each order came with a generous side of broccolini that us adults really enjoyed.    On more than one occasion over the past 2 years my son has called this his favorite restaurant in Vegas.    After having eaten here many times now, with photo booth photos as souvenirs each time, the only thing that can top it off is to actually meet Giada.",

From the moment you walk in, you are treated like gold.  Service is top notch and the managers are constantly walking around to ensure that you have everything you need and are content.  Thanks to the roulette table, I was able to splurge 2 nights in a row and I still can't get the taste of those bacon wrapped dates out of my mouth.  Paige was my server both nights and she was terrific.  The management (specifically John D.) was  great also and made me feel like royalty during my meals.

    "text": "The best brunch of my life. Hands down.  Came on a Saturday afternoon in July.  Ambiance: Perfect. Gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains and Las Vegas boulevard. Quiet, romantic music, and a cozy interior. Super comfortable chairs and impeccable, classy table settings.   Food: My husband and I both got the brunch tasting menu ($55 each).  First course: A romaine salad, two pastries, and a selection of antipasti.  The salad was light and refreshing with a bit of parmesan and a citrusy vinegarette dressing. The pastries were flaky and not too sweet. The ricotta-lemon-blueberry Danish was surprisingly light. I could have just eaten the filling with a spoon. The highlight was the mozzarella balls, soaked in a not too spicy chili oil, with a bit of lemon zest. A simple bite elevated to something truly amazing.   Second course: I got the cavatelli. My husband got the salmon Benedict. The cavatelli was perfectly cooked and enrobed in a decadent pesto cream sauce. It was filling yet light, and had bits of peppers and mushrooms. This is what pasta should be. The benedict was perfectly cooked and the yolks ran beautifully when we broke them. Hollandaise was lemony, complex and had just the right amount of heat.   Third course: Dessert. I got the lemon souffle and he got the chocolate espresso cake. The souffle was light, fluffy and just melted in my mouth. The cake was the exact opposite, as it needed to be. Heavy, rich, and layered with an ice cream whose base had been infused with espresso beans overnight.   Overall, a beyond brilliant experience that I'm sure will be repeated on every future trip to Vegas.",

The food is delicious but it is the service that makes this a go to local gem.  The servers enjoy what they do and are always willing to give a glowing recommendation on menu items. Giada is also worth the trip just for the decadent dessert selections. I suggest a seat with a view if you are visiting from out of town.  The Limoncello Souffle with Creme Anglaise is as much fun to eat as it is to look at. Fluffy, sweet with a rich creamy center. I can still taste it, hours later. It was also a nice place to take my parents who were visiting from out of town. They love celebrity chefs so this was an obvious choice for Brunch and they were definitely impressed.",

When I made my reservation, I indicated that we requested a window table. Additionally, when I confirmed the reservation that afternoon I asked about the view and was told, \" all our tables look out over the strip...we have your requests from your reservation.\"  When we were shown to our table, I was surprised that we were in a back room with a TV playing a football game and no view. I went back to the hostess, and asked about our table. Stating that we had requested a view, I asked about options. She said that they did not have a table for our larger party. She then had me speak to the manager John. John apologized and offered to move us if we could wait a while. I reviewed that the reservation had been made over a month prior and that it was confirmed that afternoon. I did not want to wait, so asked that he could ensure that our meal experience was very good. He assured me he would, and that he would personally come to the table. Our meal experience was not very good. Appetizers were excellent. The eggplant entree was very salty. Other entrees were ok. Service was nice, but not very attentive. We piled our plates to get them out of our way, crumbs were not cleared from the table, etc. John never came by or checked on us. It was disappointing. At the end of the meal the server brought out a plate with 2 complimentary cookies that said happy anniversary. I tried to speak to John before leaving, but he was busy talking to a table.  I was looking to have an exceptional meal for my parents anniversary and was disappointed in all areas.  I would not recommend Giada's for a special occasion, as they are not able to follow through on requests or to make the occasion special.",

The best thing that me and the hubs ordered was the meat and cheese plate. When we try new restaurants we like to try a few different dishes... Here when we ordered thru a few appetizers (mind you they are small) the waiter proceeds to cut me off and say \"you realize your ordering like 5 appetizers\".... I was just kind of thrown off by that response, one order of cheese is like 4 slices and the meat follows the same pattern, followed by a few meatballs so honestly I didnt think it was too much food. Not sure what he was implying when he said that but it is what it is.   Hefty bill at the end and left with a feeling of ... little satisfaction. I would come back here as I did like their options for meat and cheese platters but theres just way better places out here to eat for the same price.",

Sat at the bar as the place was busy and since it was just me didn't need to take up a whole table.  Jeremy at the bar was excellent!!!! Defiantly ordered more, due to his recommendation and enjoyed taking with him. But the food was beyond amazing!!! Ordered the octopus salad, as I am a massive octopus fan. Literally one of the best octopuses I have ever had. Super tender, full of flavor, perfectly cooked!! Originally turned down the bread plate but Jeremy said it was well worth it so I agreed!!! OMG the focaccia was out of this world. And the presentation made it ever better!! Told Jeremy I trusted his judgement for my pasta dish....he orders the lobster ravioli and it was mouth watering. Perfect amount of lobster, the kale salsa verde sauce was not what I was expect but was delicious! Can't wait to have my leftovers!!!! Knowing what I had, and growing up in the casino food/bev world, I have a hard time believing the few negative reviews I read on yelp about this place. This place is amazing!!!!",

I ordered the Bucatini, which is pasta with a red sauce. I added shrimp to the dish.It was delicious! The lamb chops are also a great choice as well as the Ravioli.  For dessert we ordered Giada's signature cookies,  which you can't go wrong. I was not a huge fan of the Peaches and Cream souffle. Overall I will definitely go back. It is so worth it!! Cheers!",

Upon arriving a few minutes early for our reservation, we decided to have a drink at the bar which was followed by being seated at our table. Both the appetizers and service were great, however once ordering our entrees, I noticed my fiance looked a little flushed (she ordered the fettuccine with lobster & I had the rissotto with scallops). Upon finishing our dinner, we went straight to our hotel because she wasn't feeling well. Needless to say our night did not go as planned as she was continuously making trips to the restroom. We couldn't quite figure out the cause until realizing I hadn't sampled her dish. It made me very sad to see her sick especially because of how much we had been looking forward to the night.",

    "text": "Giada was mediocre for the hype, but nonetheless was a solid meal along the Vegas strip.   The toasted bread crackers they bring out with butter, salt, pesto, and chili before the meal are amazing. A nice light bite before dinner, which was great. Also a big fan of the Fresh Mozzarella Crostini. The sweet honey topped with salt and chili was an amazing contrast to the creamy cheese, and the toast was as crunchy as I was hoping it would be.   Drinks were good, but nothing special. I had a blood orange martini. Good, but nothing to write home about.  The meal, unfortunately, was much less exciting than the appetizers. We shared the Spaghetti (with shrimp, mascarpone, lemon, and basil) and it was lackluster. The mascarpone wasn't as creamy as it should be, and overall it lacked flavor. The Italian Fried Chicken was pretty good, but didn't entirely make sense. The soupy cacciatore sauce was good, but didn't really match the flavors of the chicken seasoning. It was a huge portion too, and it should have only come with one piece of chicken and a small side.  We finished with the Giada cookies, which were very good. I'd definitely go there for those again!  Overall, a nice experience, but it's not a major destination for an upscale meal.",

    "text": "This is a long review, but in a nutshell, you'll love the service and the food; just don't order the veal.   Started with a reservation for 12 and needed to change it very last minute (think: the morning of my Sat reservation) for 15 people. For more than 14 people, you are supposed to go through group sales, a pre fixe menu, and make a CC payment. Lucky for me, Amber, of group sales, spoke with the manager who allowed us to change the reservation to 15 without going through that entire hassle!   2 of my guests last minute canceled and we actually ended up with 13 people with our last 2 guests arriving late. We were seated quickly without them being present and weren't given any problems for them showing up late.  We were seated in a semi-private area perfect for our group and since it was early in the evening (5pm reservation), the two tables next to us weren't occupied until immediately before we left.  Our group of servers were amazing! Our glasses were always full, we didn't feel rushed, and we weren't waiting/ having to look for someone if we needed something. They really took care of us. Service was some of the best I've had.   I tried some appetizers that we shared family style, the scallop and crab risotto, bone-in rib eye, wagyu beef, spaghetti, another pasta I can't remember it's name, lamb, and veal. The risotto with its crab chunks was delicious, rib eye was seasoned well, wagyu beef and lamb was deliciously tender, and you can't go wrong with any of the pastas. The veal was breaded and didn't seem to complement the rest of the menu. Hence, the loss of one star.   Dessert was delicious (chocolate tart for the win!) and my brother was given complimentary cookies as we were celebrating his send-off to Navy boot camp. It was very nice of them and a great end to a delicious meal.  Overall, a great experience and I would definitely return.",

We ordered the family style tasting menu so we were able to try a little bit of everything. The antipasto platters were huge, delicious, and had lots of options. The meatball appetizer was by far the best meatball I've ever had. Our favorite dish by far was the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. I'm still craving it! The service was impeccable as well - our wine and water glasses were never empty. The only thing that would have made my night better was if Giada herself had been there. Would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Ohhhh, I wanted to love this restaurant. This was to be the highlight of our trip. If I ever were to visit Giada again, I would definitely do things a bit differently - rather, I would order differently. Giada's philosophy is, \"I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything.\" To express the mantra, there are two menus in Giada: one with several small plates, and the other with entrees. You can mix and match from each menu, and the restaurant staff is more than accommodating to meet your request. (In fact, the staff was excellent the entire time we were here. This review is more bias based on the food.) The house-made foccacia and cheese crisps served tableside were heavenly. The selection of short plates is exceptional. Actually, that's where the fault lies - in my choices! Torn between item menus, I decided to opt for a small plate as an app and a pasta dish as an entree. It's Giada, it's Italian, so a pasta dish made sense. For the app, I decided on the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with sausage. The dish hit every flavor component - sweet from the dates, salty from the sausage, smokey from the bacon, and spicy from the chili inside. I would definitely order it again, if given the chance. The pasta dish is where my meal derailed. I ordered lamb ragu with mint-yogurt sauce. Taste-wise, the dish was amazing, but the PORTION was downright pathetic. Why am I paying 30-something dollars for literally three strips of pasta dough and two tablespoons of sauce? Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but absolutely not worth the money. (The waiter told me they are removing it from the menu; perhaps that's why.) In fact, the entree portions all around seemed underwhelming.  Giada's restaurant should have the wow-factor, but instead, I found we are paying for the branding. The food was delicious, but I can't justify paying for Giada's name for the small portions. I would be open-minded to returning to Giada just to try some of those small plates, though.",

    "text": "My wife was very excited to eat at this restaurant.  Of course, we all know who Giada is and we were expecting to be blown away by the food, atmosphere, and service.  A big disappointment would be a good way of describing it.  The hostesses were nice and we felt welcomed. We made a reservation for brunch, which was the first weekend they ever served it.  A table next to the window with a view was nice so it was easy to pass the time waiting for our food.  I made the mistake of wanting an appetizer.  Yes, they cost more money than they are worth.  Yes, they come in very small portions.  That is a given at most of the nicer restaurants, so it didn't really bother me.  What I ordered bothered me.  Meatballs.  I ordered meatballs because the waitress recommended it.  Mediocre at best.  My wife makes better meatballs and she's   not a very good cook.  I could make better meatballs if I bought some frozen ones and dumped some Ragu and cheese on it.  At least I could have 50 of them for the price of the four I received in a cup and saucer.  The presentation consisted of meatballs in a cup.  Can you imagine reading meatballs in a cup on a menu?  Surely no one in their right mind orders meatballs in a cup.  Do not order this, unless you just hit on the craps table and you don't know how to blow through your money.  My wife ordered a nutella latte right at the beginning.  She did not receive this drink for a long time.  When it finally came, it looked nice because who ever made it wrote a big G in chocolate  on the top.  Little did we know, the G was for Garbage.  It tasted like a regular hot chocolate.  Neither of us could taste nutella at all.  We both took a couple of sips, then the drink sat on the table untouched.  Now for the food.  My wife ordered... sorry, i can't remember what she ordered because it was so forgetful.  Oh yeah, it was eggs, toast, and some kind of tomatoes.  Usually I remember all the details but at this point, I stopped caring.  I felt sorry for her, but also laughed and made fun of her for making such a terrible choice.  Needless to say, she didn't eat it all, and it wasn't because it was a large portion.  She also ordered a pastry.  I ordered the $29 chicken and waffles.  More like the $not worth it chicken and awfuls. I'm not sure if I ever felt so mad over $29.  Luckily, I only yelled and cried on the inside so I didn't embarrass my wife.  I have made better waffles at a continental breakfast.  I've made better waffles without looking at the instructions.  They call these things $29 waffles?!  They make me sick.    You know what made me sicker?  The chicken.  The ridiculous chicken they put on my plate.  It looked like a baby chicken.  It even had a wing.  I don't know about the chicken and waffles you eat, but usually I don't get a wing with it.  Have you ever seen someone eat a wing with a knife and fork?  Next thing you know, I'm eating a snickers with a knife and fork like Costanza.  Cutting anything in this restaurant will be a tall task.  The knife's handle is turned opposite of the blade.  I have never in my life seen a knife in a restaurant like this.  If you are into martial arts or have a hand that grew 90 degrees to the left of your wrist, then you will use this knife very naturally.  It's served with a bowl full of baby tomatoes, bell peppers, and a tomato paste.  Now, I'm no chef or chicken and waffles connoisseur, but I not sure how that fits in.  Maybe it does, I just haven't had enough drinks and substances pumped into my body.  The pastry she ordered came after our meal even though she ordered it at the beginning to eat with her latte.  It was supposed to be a delicious $4 raspberry danish.  It was a hockey puck with a red stain in the middle.  Absolutely no flavor.  My local donut shop has better danishes.  My wife took 2 small bites and I took one just to have something else to gripe about.  It granted me my wish.  One other thing: We were not the only one disappointed.  My wife and I got a kick out of watching the lady at the table next to us react to each plate that was served to her.  Her face was one of shock, horror, and finally mad.  In that exact order.  We felt the same.  If you guys want to experience these emotions yourself, book a reservation asap.  I give the hostesses 4 stars.  The waitress 2 stars.  I give the food 2 stars, only because it was edible.  For the money, do not come to this place.  Completely not worth it.  If you want a meal that you actually get what you pay for, go somewhere else.  Especially the brunch, which is not any better than iHop, Cracker Barrel, or you mom's house.",

I love the decor and set up and color and the whole she-bang. the atmosphere was my favorite part of dining here.  the food was good. not sure if it's because we went on a holiday but the menu seemed a bit limited to me. I did expect a little more pasta dishes since it is an Italian restaurant, but there was none so don't expect any of that.   what we ordered: tenderloin sliders- I didn't try it, but everyone who ate one was raving about it and said it was the best out of the dishes.  lemon pesto grilled cheese sandwich- we got one with prosciutto and one without. the one without was my dish and I really enjoyed it  sweet ricotta pizza- this was good also! as good as a pizza can get :)  for about four dishes, it was around $120 which isn't bad at all for a Vegas restaurant. service was great, from the hostesses to the servers to management-- our server was super friendly and attentive! would come back when I revisit Vegas (with a reservation!)",

It was not to be, it gets 2 stars only because of the physical side of the place, it is a great place to have a meal, it's just a shame the meal could not do it justice.  For a start, the Charcuterie board, this was something the wife raved about, honestly, I have no idea what she must have been smoking on previous visits, this board really set the tone for the whole meal, bland.  I had the Pappardelle, it's obvious that they use quality ingredients and yes, I am a fan of letting the ingredients be the flavors of the meal rather than loading it with spices, however, there was little to no taste in the dish.  We also shared a short rib, a dish I love, again, bland, I would have thought that something was up with my taste buds, had we not eaten at La Cave the night before which showed they were working fine.  The service was good, though the diet coke got to stand empty for lengths of time which really was a pain due to one overriding  thing, about 10 minutes into the meal the heating kicked on and did not stop, waiters sweating everywhere, guests sweating (one of our party actually left) and even after speaking to the manager, who for some reason decided it was below her to come to the table where the party is taking a good run at a $1000 tab, so the wife went out to talk to her, the heat remained on.  On that point alone, sorry Giada, you failed.",

Nancy was our server and she definitely added to our dining experience from the time we sat down she and her team were extremely attentive and did not miss a beat. We started with the seafood tower which was absolutely delicious!!! From there we moved on to the Arugula salad which is a must have and a Giada specialty; the prosciutto and Gorgonzola plate- both melt in your mouth; then the flights of pasta- our favorite was the lemon spaghetti and we finished with the pumpkin souffle and the cookie plate.",

Really nice view and a very open layout with elegant decor. Noise aside, it is pleasant.  Service: Great. Fast. Friendly.  Food: Just OK. Nothing was bad. But of the various appetizers, entrees, and drinks tried - nothing really stood out or had a \"keep me coming back\" factor. People keep mentioning the tiny portions, but I have no issue with that. The portions were just about right for us, and allowed us to try many things without getting too full. I personally did not like the meatballs. Your mileage may vary.  Prices: Very, very expensive. I honestly did not feel like the food overall really warranted the prices.  If you like Italian food, smaller portions, and don't mind the pricing - this place *is* worth trying. This is why I am giving it 4-stars, as I don't think people seem to care as much for 3-stars, even though there is nothing wrong with 3-stars.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Giada's, but unfortunately the restaurant fell flat.  I anticipated the food to be the centerpiece of the visit, but it ended up being the leading contributor to my one-star experience.  Three of the guests in our party shared two orders of the risotto.  Not only did both plates have a significant number of crab shells (real crab at least), but all three became ill after eating it.  Admittedly, the pasta and branzino were cooked much better, although the simplicity of the dish, an apparent hallmark of the restaurant, rendered them far from memorable.  Service was more akin to the risotto than the pasta.  Our waiter Joey had a strong, friendly start that quickly disappeared, just as he did.  His salesmanship was highlighted by his attempt to push the prix-fixe menu primarily based on an autographed Giada folio with the menu and a few recipes.  Admittedly, Joey was probably correct that the restaurant's selection of the least interesting dishes for the prix-fixe was likely not what was driving diners to choose it.  The pitch on the prix-fixe was followed by his description of one of Giada's signature cocktails as the most popular selection but also the most frequently returned to the bar.    After his presentation of the menu, Joey disappeared for an extended period of time, and later in the meal he did not even bother to visit the table from the time the first course was served to when the check was delivered.  This seemed particularly surprising given the apparent high ratio of staff to guests at the restaurant overall.  As if the experience wasn't already far short of expectations, the check was also incorrect, as Joey had added a random dish that had not been ordered or served.    As someone who professionally reviewed restaurants for years, this restaurant falls on the very low end of its peer group.",

That being said, I was disappointed with my experience at Giada. If I were rating the service, atmosphere, drinks and dessert it would get 5+++ stars! The restaurant is warm, classy and inviting. There was a very nice view of The Strip from our table. Our waiter was just awesome!! He knew so much about the menu, gave recommendations, was very descriptive, so polite and seemed like an all around nice person. We started with cocktails. I ordered the Giada, it was beautiful and delicious! We decided to do the tasting menu. It was around $125pp. That is expensive but not unexpected since we were in Vegas. It was 4 courses plus you get some recipes and an autographed picture of Giada. The waiter brought out an assortment of breads and spreads to the table. That was excellent!! Next, the first real course were appetizers which were a few of Giada's favorite antipasti. All pretty good, stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates etc. Next course was the pasta course which was the worst. Pasta was gummy and flavorless. I was expecting so much more in terms of quality. For main course, we ordered the veal and salmon. Both dry and also flavorless. The dessert course was pretty epic! They push out a dessert cart and each guest can select 3 desserts each. Not only did we get to try 6 desserts which were all delicious, the waiter brought out sorbet for me for my birthday. Overall, a ton of food was served!! So if you have a big appetite this place is for you. I wish the main course and the pasta course were better...it would've made this a fantastic dining experience!!",

Not a single thing about this restaurant reminded us of her warm personality and her constantly stating how important \"branding\" is. This place screams \"I have more investors to please than I can handle\" and \"this is my first restaurant\" like crazy. Prices need to reflect this as it is not even close to being on par with other \"celebrity chef\" restaurants on the Strip. There is a lot of work left to be done here.   That being said, most of the food was fine. Everything needed a bit of editing and more salt. The \"grilled\" artichokes with lemon aioli were served ice cold, and the \"grilled\" zucchini & eggplant involtini was served room temp. The pancetta in the arugula salad was chopped way too large for such a delicate salad but the parmigiano was sliced perfectly thin. The aioli was by far the best thing on the table all evening.  We were honestly surprised we could not hear Drai's, but, when all the windows were opened, it became too loud to hold a pleasant conversation. We did not complain, but our waiter kept apologizing profusely. And that was our cue that it was time to go. So we did.  There are so many better restaurants on the Strip for the same price range, it's really not worth a return visit. I highly suggest reading the other reviews to get a better picture of whether or not this is the dining experience you want to have. I wish we would have.",

    "text": "Ripped Off At Giada! Let me start by saying that I never even bothered to eat at the restaurant after my experience at the bar. Four of us sat down for a cocktail before dinner. We ordered two Vodka with juice on the rocks, a beer and a margarita. When we got the bill we were charged 14.00 per vodka drink with an additional 3.00 charge per Vodka for \"The Rocks\"? I asked what that charge was and he said it is always more for \"on the rocks\" in Vegas. I have been to Vegas hundreds of times and two of my friends with us live in Vegas. We said we NEVER heard of a 3.00 per drink charge for \"on the rocks\"! We asked if we had ordered the Vodka and not said on the rocks would he have given us ice? We also asked if we ordered w/out ice would it cost less. He could not answer except to say that is how it is in Vegas! I was so frustrated by his stupid explanation and bewildered look we just left and vowed NEVER to eat there.   Later that night we told some other Vegas locals about it and they shared a horror story as well about there recent experience at Giada. They had 8:00 Pm reservations and arrived at 7:59. The hostess told them they were backed up and to go get a drink and come back in 30 minutes. The bar in the restaurant is tiny so they had to go downstairs to get a drink. The crowds were busy and by the time they got their drinks it was time to be seated, the hostess told them they can't bring the drinks in from outside. They told the hostess she told them to go get the drinks, she said sorry either leave the drinks or gulp them down but you can't bring them in. It was 80.00 worth of drinks! They guzzled them down and were seated and waited FOREVER to be served and all they had to say was the food was fair at best, the service poor and the prices way too high!  BTW.. I have never given a 1 star review before, I am NOT the angry kind of customer and generally only leave good reviews of places I enjoy. This experience aggravated me so much I had to tell it like it is.",

I hadn't planned on eating here until yesterday when a Las Vegas native friend, who is both full-blooded Italian and a superb cook in her own right, sang the praises of Giada. Boy, was she right! We had lunch here and it was simply outstandingly delicious and unique; what an exceptional food experience. We started out with an appetizer order of the chicken meatballs with mushrooms and a reduced Marsala wine sauce; OMG! Incredibly mouthwatering; well worth the visit in and of themselves. My friend had the Lasagna pasta entree and I had the smoked salmon and avocado sandwich, which was served open-faced on toasted whole grain bread with marinaded onions and roasted capers; YUM! Both lunches were served with the freshest arugula salad with a delicious light dressing capped off with slivers of aged Parmesan cheese. We drank the Bolle bottled mineral water (with gas); it was very refreshing. For dessert, we each had an espresso with a shared shot of Sambuca Romana. What a great way to cap-off a superior dining experience. We were ably and politely served by our Table Captain, Stephanie, and her bus boys. I would highly recommend this place and I clearly intend to return. Oh, my",

Having made reservations in advance we were seated in a timely manner and our server, Patrick, was very attentive and provided great service.

We started with the mussels which were good but a small portion for the price. It took another 15 minutes for the grilles artichokes come come out afterwards leaving us wondering if they were meant to be Luke warm because they sat. They were flavorless and had no grill flavor. My husbands entree was good ; the pappardelle but mine was, again, flavorless and oily. I had to forgetto. For $28 it was a pile if Israeli like couscous with, I'm not kidding, 3 small slices of zucchini and 2 small Chantral mushrooms. Very oily at the bottom. We skipped desert.   For $200 meal I would much rather go back to Mesa, Olive or Nobu. As much as I wanted to have a special night, this was a disappointment.",

    "text": "I booked this event for 22 people thru the group sales division. We were offered three choice for a family style price fix dinner, and we went with the top option.  At $125 per head and a minimum of $150 required before tax and tip, we all arrived on 10-5-14 for an experience that topped all others anywhere that I have been.  We were greeted promptly at the top of the escalator, and escorted to 3 tables, all beautifully laid out.  I spoke to the GM, and all the wait staff, to greet and handle the alcohol arrangements.  Everyone was super friendly, and the feast began right on time.  This is no ordinary meal, and it took all of my eating powers to try every one of the 28-30 items we were presented with. The house wines flowed freely, and a few awesome cocktails as well, and every dish they brought was spectacular, starting with fresh breads, and amazing amounts of appetizers.  After catching our breath they set up new serving dishes and proceeded to serve up the lemon spaghetti w/shrimp, lobster ravioli, and some amazing salad.  The dinner entrees were the bone-in rib eye, chicken , and scallops w. risotto, all amazing. I requested a nice vegetarian meal for one, and they presented my friend with a beautiful plate of food, which he was very pleased with. For dessert they kept bringing all kinds of wonderful cookies, and other treats, plus each table had fresh sorbet w/ berries, that was made with agave nectar for diabetics like me.  I asked for whipped cream, and they made it fresh for me, which is awesome.  Tremendous service, great food, and great company all for $215per person, including taxes, and tip.  This made sound high to for some reading here, but believe me, not one person complained, as it was an amazing experience.  As a foodie, this was the best ever, so I give it my top rating of all time.  Giada knows how to do first class for sure, so go and enjoy yourself.",

I was so disappointed and felt betrayed by you.  You are lovely and I so wanted to love your restaurant and food! The restaurant is pretty, open and light.  The service was okay.  My party of four went on a Saturday evening  in mid-May 2016.   The food was very bland and so tasteless!  I usually don't care about the price of food, I enjoy good food!  But I felt so cheated by my experience.  I literally could not eat any of the entree!  The waitress sent the Maitre D over and I told him my veal chop was not a quality piece of meat and that it was very bland and tasteless.   He said that's the way it should taste \"it's a taste preference\"!  I said \"what taste\"! Giada do you know what the food is like!  I can't imagine you do?  We paid $500 and ordered a lot of food but not one dish was edible!  Shame on you!!",

We did have to wait a few minutes before we saw our server Nathan but he by far was what made our night! He was knowledgable, friendly and seemed to really like what he does. I had the bucatini which for those of you who don't like spice, I'd recommend going a different route. While delicious, the spice was a bit much for me. The cauliflower side was out of this world! Fiance had another pasta dish that was flavorful and in my opinion the best I've ever had! Nathan sent out a round of moscato to congratulate my fiance and I as we had just got engaged which was such a nice touch and much appreciated. We cannot wait to back again. We ended the night with the apple tart and chocolate cake! Was so pleased with the experience!",

The staff at the greeting desk all wore the same black dress but it looked subpar as it didn't fit well and super short on some of them but I got over it.  Seated on a round table which was nice. Ordered the medium size Giadas favorite appetizer platter and we devoured it - it was very tasty especially the bacon wrapped dates. The table ordered various items - risotto, braised short ribs, spicy spaghetti dish that starts with a 'b', and surf and turf. The risotto hit the spot along with the spicy spaghetti. The bummer is that my friends surf and turf came out incorrect-her steak was rare when she asked for medium well. By the time it was sent back and redone for her, we were all done with our dishes which was disappointing for a first time experience. The manager did come by to apologize and did the right thing by providing a complimentary samples of desserts. Overall it was  good but could have been better. I think one of the highlights for us was goofing around in the photo booth in the reception area and taking group pics! It was also nice that they had someone to take picture at the bottom of the stairs-that's a nice touch for special occasions",

    "text": "My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7.  We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer.  We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM.  After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!).  We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts.  We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk.  A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner.  She started to say \"Oh I\"m sorry but we...\"  At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \"be nice\".  She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated.  Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot.  I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu.  We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated.  The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing.  We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta.  The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths.  There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were.  The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed.  While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again.  I myself have experienced True Italian hospitality, unfortunately it was nowhere to be found at Giada.",

The waiter, Fred, made our experience extremely enjoyable.  The antipasti sampler platter was amazing, as was the bread medley that was brought out to us first. In our party there were three dishes ordered.  The first was the lobster ravioli (my order).  I was a little disappointed as the portion was a bit small for $36.  The sauce was good and there was a good amount of lobster in the dish.  The second dish ordered in my party was the shrimp pasta which was given two thumbs up.  The third dish was the vegetable bolognese which was also highly regarded.  The desserts were great. We had the chocolate tart and the espresso tower. Both were great and the prices weren't ridiculous either. Overall, it was a bit pricey, but it was good. I'd go back.",

    "text": "Having seen Giada on the cooking shows for years but never having had her food before, I was excited when local friends suggested we give Giada's a try on a recent Friday night. But after spending almost $300 on an extremely marginal meal - sans any expensive wine - I was a little taken aback by just how bad Giada's really is. For instance, a $79 bone in ribeye came with a bone so big it would have made Fred Flintstone blush. Extremely showy, but not very much fun if you were actually looking for meat, as the bone had to take up at least 10 ounces of the dish. The meat itself was completely flavorless - it didn't seem at all seasoned, not even salt - and the cut was most likely \"choice\" as opposed to something quality. The mushroom soup my wife ordered was flavorless and bland, but the lemon/shrimp spaghetti pretty good. All in all, not awful, but so many better choices. Of course, one needs to remember that Giada's prides itself on a \"female centric\" tasting menu, where no one actually really eats any food beyond a nibble (but the white wine and xanax flow freely.) Even desert was blah. Of course the setting was spectacular - and there was \"big name\" guests in town, but I can sincerely tell you that the hot dog I had at Pink's in Planet Hollywood about an hour after this meal was a far sight better than anything Giada put on the table. Even the waiter seemed adept at suggesting only the most expensive dishes - and ways to share them - so everyone is on point - problem is, just not sure what point they are trying to make at Giada's. Let's see: Pretty face - check. Celebrity pedigree - check. Really cool surname that evokes the glory of American film - check, check, check. Decent food that tastes good - hmmm? Save your money - there is so much better in Vegas.",

Our food came out before we even received our bottle of wine. We finally had to ask for the manager once we were almost done with our meal why we STILL hadn't even gotten it. We also ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was extremely fishy, not fresh at all and at this point we were already having a negative experience.

Was it delicious! Our server David S I believe he mentioned was great as well. He was very attentive to us and so funny. We asked a few questions about the area and Hotel and he was very knowledgeable and patient with all our questions. What a great personality. Overall I give it an A+. I would defin return and spread the word about this place.",

    "text": "At first glance I thought this would be a great dining experience, but by the time we finished I had renamed this restaurant 'The Emperor's New Clothes' as it receives rave reviews but is overpriced and pretentious.  This was our first trip back to Las Vegas in a while so I was surprised at how pricey food has become but this place contains the added premium for a celebrity chef and the word 'chic' in the description.  We went for dinner and ordered 5 plates (2 antipasti, 2 pastas, 1 side and ZERO entrees). Add in 2 glasses of wine and the bill reached $200.  Had we not eaten 2 orders of bread I would have left hungry as the portions are... dainty.  Clams casino uses the worlds smallest clams. The shells are no bigger than a thumbnail and the clam about the size of a pencil eraser.  The grilled octopus was the equivalent of 2 bites.  The scallop and crab risotto was 2 scallops and about a cup of risotto. You get the idea.   Don't get me wrong, for the most part the food tasted very good but it's tapas portions   without the advanced notice that it's a tapas restaurant.  Oh and if you prefer a good craft beer with dinner, forget it you'd be better off drinking water here.",

    "text": "I was excited to get a reservation at 8:15 p.m. on a weekday only a couple of days beforehand.  I had wanted to try this restaurant ever since it opened.  It's situated on the second floor of the Cromwell and is considered part of the Total Rewards family, so you get $1 off per entree if you show them your free membership card (and get points)!  We arrive a little early and had planned to order a drink at the bar.  The restaurant wasn't full - maybe 1/2 or so?  I noticed that throughout the night, the restaurant was never at capacity.  Maybe they do this purposely to allow for better service?  Anyway, we were seated only a few minutes after checking in, so we didn't have a chance to order at the bar, which looked like it had nice and comfortable seating.  The restaurant offers a tasting menu for $100 something along with a booklet of of a couple of the recipes and a picture of Giada.  I noticed they also did this at Gordon Ramsay Steak, too.  We declined and instead ordered from the regular menu.  We also noticed that their specialty cocktails were listed along with photos on an iPad instead of on a menu.  GR did this as well...maybe it's a new Vegas thing?  I liked it, though.  You don't order with the iPad, though, but order with your waiter.  We ordered:  -Orzo Meatballs - Really tender meatballs (comes with five small meatballs).  Sauce seemed like regular spaghetti sauce but you could tell the meatballs were not your ordinary fare. -Lemon and Basil Spaghetti ($34) - The spaghetti was supposed to come al dente, but it didn't.  It was slightly overcooked.  Boo.  The two shrimp it came with were very large, sweet, and delicious.  However, the spaghetti itself was disappointing.  I could taste more of the pasta itself vs the sauce, which was a light lemon sauce.  I felt slightly cheated at the price and wasn't very happy with the dish.  -Scallops & Crab Risotto ($32) - This was also very average.  My friend had been craving a good risotto after a while, but this just tasted like soupy rice.  The scallops were a bit on the salty side, and I think there were maybe three little pieces of crab in the rice.  It was decent but not as good as OC's Pinot Provence corn risotto I had a year or so ago. -Broccoli Rabe ($10) - My friend thought this was a bit too salty, but I though it was just right.  It was cooked nicely and had a slightly sweet chili flavoring.    -Chocolate Budino - Came chilled and was very smooth (thicker than a pudding and creamier).  Thumbs up.  The little sprinkles of pistachio crumbs were really good, too.    They gave us a short of sweet sparkling wine as an amuse bouche, which I liked.  It reminded me of a light moscato.  They also give you three kinds of bread.  Our favorite was the big crispy cheese \"chip\".  Yum.  They also give you a platter of five different condiments like lemon butter (nicely whipped with a slight taste of lemon), dried capers, etc.  Cool!  Drinks were about $14 each.  I ordered one that was quite large and semi-sweet  (it was pink colored and not her signature cocktail).  It didn't seem to have much alcohol in it, but it was refreshing at least.  Unfortunately, our entrees were lackluster and slightly disappointing.  We had a much better dinner the night before at Gordon Ramsay Steak, though GR was more expensive.  Giada's was no inexpensive meal either but just wasn't worth it.  Restaurant decor is soothing and nice - reminded me of someone's fancy house.",

The food was good however the portions were smaller than what I expected.  I ordered the mushrooms, they very flavorful and prepared to perfection.  I also ordered the shrimp and scallop risotto, it was a little bland for my taste.         This is your classic fine dining restaurant, it isn't a place for filling comfort food.

Reservations for dinner especially on the weekend, can be hard to get unless you book far in advance. I made my December reservation in October.   The Cromwell doesn't have self-parking that I'm aware of. But the valet was helpful in giving us directions to the restaurant. We got there early and got some gambling in before dinner.   Apparently there's a photo booth by the entrance next to the escalators. My friend and I skipped that since neither of us are in to the selfie thing. Anyway, the restaurant is fairly large, and it's busy. I didn't see any tables empty for very long.   So on to the food. I had the pasta fagioli soup which was better than average, and the bucatini which I really liked. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had just enough heat. My friend has the scallop risotto that I got a taste of. I thought it was surprisingly light but delish. We were too full for desserts. On a side note, the bread presentation is awesome. There are several different types of bread and a bunch of accoutrements to go with it. My fave was the pesto.   Overall service was spotty, hence only 3 stars. I know the restaurant is still kind of new but waiting 6 minutes just to get your menu is a bit off and it wasn't due to lack of staff. For the price you pay, and the portion sizes, and the service, I wouldn't come back here. The food is above average but not \"wow!\"",

It's an elegant restaurant and resembled Giada's taste. The lamb Colorado chops were melting in our mouth and  flavorful. Also the calamari was very light panko  I believe breaded and delicious. The complimentary Rosemary bread was so yummy. And when they opened the windows where we were sitting was the best view of Las Vegas strip and also the decor of the inside. And everyone working there was very friendly and prompt. My 5 and 2 year old sons always watch Giada's foodnetwork shows and saw her photos and asked the hostess is Giada's here? They love watching her cook as do I. We just wished we could of met her. The hostess said she's in Italy. We were there on Memorial Day weekend Saturday. We will definitely go back.",

We were greeted with a smile by the two hostess and waited just enough time to get into the Giada photo booth and snap a couple of photos for keepsake. We were then escorted to our table. Once we walked into the dining room, we were in awe. The dining room, to no surprise, was stunning. The view of the strip and along side Flamingo Road, there was frankly no bad seat in the restaurant.  Everyone we can into contact with greeted us with a smile and everyone, despite it being Christmas, seemed like they truly enjoyed working there.  After getting situated our server, Rebecca, made a timely entrance with an introduction and made mention of several items on their Christmas menu, she also excited us with the house made Bloody Mary's, which we ordered.  Breakfast was perfect! We ordered items from the Christmas menu along with the daily menu: The Breakfast Contadina and Polenta en Cocotte. Prepared perfectly taste wise and portion wise for breakfast.  Our water cups were always filled and everyone seemed to work beautifully together. Breakfast was without a hitch not just with us, but every guest that dined there that day.  The only thing we regret was that we weren't back for dinner that same night. We will definitely return for the impeccable service and the overwhelming positive reviews that were written on dinner. The bar is set pretty high with just breakfast, hopefully it will be just as great, if not better with dinner. Can not wait!  Bravo!",

The pizza had a really nice dough, crispy and chewey all at the same time.  All pasta are made in house.  I had a sangria, it was light and refreshing.  Service was prompt, helpful and friendly.

And I thought I'd love her food. Unfortunately, I paid way too much for disappointment. I now wish I didn't do the tasting menu. It is exactly what it says. Just a taste. Maybe I should have just ordered off the regular menu.   Some bits of notes for future goers including me:  Aldante apparently means \"some crunchy bits\" in spaghetti.   Tasting platter means \"much smaller than a mouthful\"  Free reign on dessert cart means \"you get 3 pieces\"  The dessert cart included cookies which were extremely lackluster but I guess it did have a very tasty limoncello cheesecake...  Service was off. We hardly saw our server. When he asked how it was we did say it wasn't what we expected. He tried getting us some limoncello in a glass. It didn't help. The main reason we were so upset was because everything we had was already so extremely lemony. The potatoes were raw on the inside and was drenched in lemon. The creamy or cheesy polenta was a block of cheese. The lemon spaghetti was hard spaghetti with basically more lemon and dessert was lemon with more lemon.   I can't understand why we paid $250 for two people. Is a picture of Giada with some recipes worth $75? I suppose I can't say all of her food is bad. I just didn't expect this when all of her counterparts in Las Vegas have SO much better options. Otto and Mesa Grill are by far much better restaurants.   Sorry Giada. I will not be attending your restaurant ever again. I'm sure this will not ruin your success in the future but I just wanted to voice my disappointment.   That is all",

Our curved booth was front and center to the bank of windows overlooking Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  Giada's choice of interior design touches and colors was immaculate.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The cocktails were amazing.  I had one with Jameson black barrel called Flash.  All her cocktails are named after movies that her family had produced.  The cocktail was the best cocktail that I have ever had off one of those signature cocktail menus.  The bread plate came out and it had a freshly baked bun of rosemary foccacia that was presented in a cast iron bowl.  Also with some flat bread Parmesan crisps and breadsticks.  Along with those were some small bows of pink sea salt, fresh pesto, marscapone spread, and chili flakes.  We dipped and crunched our way through those while enjoying cocktails and gazing over the Strip.    For appetizers we had 1 cauliflower soup, 1 beets and cheese and apples salad, and 2 Caesar salads.  The Caesar salad's were off the charts.  the dressing was a Caesar vinaigrette that was so fresh and tasty.  Entrees were Surf and Turf - Filet Mignon under a Crab Raviolo with the most amazing sauce - each of these were the best I have ever tasted.  Pork Ragu Papperdele - pasta was perfectly al dente.  Risotto with Scallops - The best scallops I have ever tasted.  Grilled Salmon - The best I have ever tasted!  Desserts were an apple tart and a chocolate ganache.  The apple tart was excellent.  So fresh tasting and the chocolate ganache was awesome.  To give you an idea of how good the food was, I asked the waiter \"How do these dishes taste so good?  Is it the quality of the food, like the freshness?  What is it!?\"    Don't go to Las Vegas without eating here.",

My favorite dish was the carbonara pizza, it's freshly made pizza dough fired in a brick oven, the pizza had cheese, prosciutto, and a couple of easy over eggs on the top. When you crack the eggs the warm yolk drizzles over  the pizza. During my last visit to Vegas, I called Giadas and asked for a reservation, they told me they were all full. But because I am such a big fan of Giada and especially the carbonara pizza, I convinced my  group to go and wait for something to open up. We arrived exactly at noon and there were only three tables with three or four people on each table. The bar didn't have a single person! Something is definitely wrong with this picture!  We were seated promptly by a very courteous and pleasant hostess. Our server  was not very polished at all and she came to the table two times at most. When my favorite carbonara pizzas arrived, I immediately noticed something was wrong. The eggs were way over cooked with the texture of hard boiled eggs! We told one of the servers (he could have been a manager) and he apologized and instead of re firing the pizzas he brought back over easy eggs for us to switch them! what a letdown!  Upon leaving, I told the server that the pizza was not up to par, her answer was maybe there were too many pizzas ordered at the same time! Our group ordered a total of four pizzas, and there were only about nine other people in the entire restaurant. REALLY?? When I returned home, I wrote to Giada and there was no response. I wrote to her with good intentions because I'm sure she would like to know what's going on in her restaurant but I guess I was wrong. Las Vegas has thousands of eating places, I don't think Giadas will be around for long. PS- the meatballs tasted like mush! The Costco frozen meatballs are better! But after all the negative things I have mentioned in this review, I hope Giada finds out and brings that restaurant back to life, because their Carbonara pizza really was the best pizza I had ever had...............",

Service was great and the food was fabulous!  We decided we would definitely be back again.  The Lobster Hash was our favorite and the Lemon ice cream cookies (can't remember the name exactly) was the best dessert I have had in a long time.",

    "text": "First of all, our waiter, William, is the best. Very attentive, knowledgeable and courteous :)  We decided to go there for lunch on Sunday, so we called and made a reservation Sunday morning. We were glad we did, because we saw so many groups talked to the hostess and then walked away probably because the wait could be long without the reservation.  We sat next to the window facing Caesars Palace, and we also enjoyed the frantic view of traffic on Las Vegas Blvd with lots of honking sound :)  As mentioned by so many Yelpers, the interior is gracefully decorated with a homestyle-chic feel to it. It is also spacious and well lit with natural lighting.  Very relaxing and very clean.  Do I mention they have photo booth and tons of merchandise?  The food is definitely on the expensive side as the portion is relatively small. But I really enjoy my Muffuletta Sandwich with Arugula Salad, and warm Citrus Infused Italian Doughnut drizzled with powdered sugar plus Nutella (we waited a good 20 minutes for it though).  I would come back again with more people so that I could order antipasti and try its famous meatball!",

I love Giada but not her restaurant, I'd rather spend that money and eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying that this was the worst meal I have ever had in Vegas. The restaurant was very nice, but had a strong smell of smoked barbecue which I found odd since it's suppose to be an Italian restaurant. We started off with the meatballs as our appetizer which were ok. We attempted to order the octopus as well, but we were told that they ran out of it. We then ordered the spaghetti and the ravioli as our entrees along with a side of brussel sprouts. Not only was this meal overpriced, but it really did not taste good at all. The ravioli was hard and had poor taste. The spaghetti was awful...I think I could've done a better job with a box from the supermarket and a jar of tomato sauce. There's nothing worse than being hungry and having a bad meal. Luckily, the wine was good and helped us distract away from the fact that the food sucked and we left smelling like we were eating at a BBQ joint. We didn't even order desert because we couldn't get out of there fast enough after we finished our meal. If you're looking for good Italian food, don't waste your money here. Go to Scarpetta where they really know how to make Italian food.",

They called us 2 days before our reservation to say that if we wanted a window seat, we would have to guarantee we spent a minimum $200. While we ended up spending that much anyway, I thought this was really low class for a high class place and so refused to do it. They ended up sticking us in a corner. The food was okay and so was the service. The signature G drink was good. Prices were really high for what you get. We're talking chicken and pasta and meatballs, not steak and lobster. The people taking your picture as you enter to sell you later was annoying as well. This was going to be the highlight of our trip and ended up being disappointed. Small changes by the managers could make a huge difference!",

    "text": "This was the worst restaurant experience of my life.  I was so incredibly excited to eat here and could not believe that we had to get up and walk out.  First of all, we had a reservation at 6:00pm and once we arrived, our table wasn't even ready, so we had to take a seat in the waiting area.  Now, having to wait wasn't that big of a deal, but we did have a concert at 8, so it would have been nice to have been seated immediately.  The restaurant was beautiful with amazing views of the strip, and our table was right in front of the huge windows that over looked Las Vegas Blvd.  It started out nicely, but then we realized that our server never came over. We sat for about 10 minutes before  I asked a random staff member for menus,  He brought the menus, apologized for his coworker who was supposed to be our server, and said he would be right over.  Okay, so another 13-15 minutes passes and no one has come to greet us or take our order.  Again, I summon another random staff member and tell him that we are ready to order.  This man pours us water and assures us our server, who has walked past us numerous times, will be right with us.  He NEVER stopped to say anything. The only reason we even had menus or water was because we had to ask for it.  That is absolutely ridiculous. Every other table around us is being served, including a table with guests that arrived AFTER us.  By now, its about 6:50.  Our reservation was at 6:00pm.  Not one person has come to our table, so, we stood up and walked out.. It might has well have been a Mississippi Woolworths in 1954. All we needed them to do was throw hot coffee in our faces and have them call us the N word.  As we left, we walked right past the person who was supposed to be our server and he just stood there with a retarded look on his face.  Before we exited the restaurant, my sister did speak with the manager Carisa, and she did alert her boss who emailed my sister, so at least she did report the incident, but still, this whole situation was completely unacceptable.  I really wanted to eat there, but I will never give my money to that establishment. Nope. No thank you. Not a chance. Never.",

Not complaining,  just want to make you aware as the bar is very crowdedand the space is not conducive to stand around the bar. Too much traffic from the kitchen. One thing I really liked is there is a free old fashioned photo booth in the reception area though the printer was not working so the only option is to email or post the photo. Strike two. Cliff was our  waiter and was excellent. He was very professional and courteous. He even brought us a complimentary aperitif we had inquired about when he noticed we were waiting an exceptionally long time for the sommelier to bring the bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay we ordered. Plus one for Cliff -3 for the rest. To add to this without being ridiculously lengthy here. ..we waited way to long for our food. It was a Wednesday night. Can't imagine how crazy this would be on a weekend. When our dinner arrived the flavors were wonderful but my shrimp was over cooked to the point of being rubbery. There were only two shrimp on a $34 plate of pasta making this even more disappointing. Nonetheless we enjoyed our experience here and will give Giada another chance. She is really onto something and the energetic vibe is great but the place needs better kitchen management and more staff to improve quality and experience.",

I've read through some reviews that the staff can be pretty cold, but we didn't get that at all. We felt so welcomed, which is much appreciated for a girls night out.   The bread is delicious. I had the bacon wrap dates, mozzarella salad, salmon, and asparagus. All of it tasted great. The sauce the salmon came with was so good I was using the bread to clean my plate.   Some complain about the small portions. I run a lot and went for a 2 hour hike/run the same morning we went to dinner. I eat a lot. After having some of the complimentary bread, sharing the bacon wrap dates with the girls (I only had one), the salad and salmon were more than enough. In fact, I should have split the salad with someone. I didn't even ask for dessert! I always ask for dessert! I think the people who complain about the portion sizes at Giada's must eat regularly at Cheesecake Factory or something. Or maybe they're just ordering two small plates from the left side of the menu? I don't know.  The only reason that I can't give it 5 stars are the prices. I know! Vegas! I usually roll my eyes when I see people complain about the prices at a nice restaurant in Las Vegas. It's a given. However, I live here and eat out on the strip a ton. I don't mind dropping some change on good food, but I thought comparatively, Giada's food and wines by the glass was priced a few more dollars than it should have been. The wines were on a much higher markup than some other nicer places I've been.",

    "text": "After it's much anticipated opening, Giada's must be the most popular restaurant in Vegas right now.  My wife and I were in Vegas over New Year's, so we knew having dinner at Giada's would be tough.  We actually tried to make a reservation one night, but they were completely booked.  So, we decided to come early (around 11 a.m.) for lunch one day, and we only had about a five minute wait.  The decor of this restaurant is very nice, and it has a great view of the strip.  You can see all of the fresh ingredients being cooked right when you walk in the door.  I thought that was a cool design.  As for the food and service, I would rate everything as being \"good.\"  Not great, just good.  Our server was very informative about the menu, and answered any questions that we had.  There was one thing that really bugged me about this place.  Our server informed us that in order to get bread for lunch, you had to order some antipasti.  Seriously, I have to order something just to get some pizza dough bread??  So, since this was our first time here, we decided to order the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese plate ($13).  The cheese, bread, and pesto/olive oil sauce were good, but the cheese was hard to eat because it had to be mashed up.  Go with a softer cheese if you like those.  As for our main dishes, my wife ordered the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese with heirloom tomatoes ($16).  It came with these zucchini strips which looked like really thin french fries.  My wife commented that they were good, but were difficult to eat.  She also mentioned that her sandwich was good.  I ordered the pasta of the day, which just happened to be lasagna ($24).  I was told that it was a \"traditional lasagna\", but I've never seen eggplant in a traditional lasagna.  It was served in a small but deep dish, and came with a small arugala salad.  My dish was pretty good, but I've certainly had better lasagna at many other places.  I most certainly love Italian food, and I thought Giada's was good, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I've had much better Italian food at other restaurants throughout my life.  Just being honest.",

We ordered right away BC we were starving. 15 min for our drinks and 40 min for our food to hit the table.

    "text": "Wow...... bad wow.........  First. There is a dress code. The hostess will turn you away if you aren't wearing a sleeved shirt. It's 100 outside. No excuses. You can buy this shirt you can't fit though! Only smalls avaliable. Or... Go to the gift shop. Or stuff yourself into a tiny girls sweater and hope it doesn't rip........ it was a bit ridiculous, but I lent my friend my sweater so he didn't have to walk back to the hotel in the awful heat. It's ok if he looks silly wearing my sweater, but can't walk in with his tank top? The sweater survived.  He ended up taking it off because seriously. He isn't bothering anyone.   Next, coffee...... waiter spills cream over the table and 'cleans it' by going through the motions. We did most of the cleaning because he didn't know how to clean a spill......  Now.... food...........   My fiance ordered 'giada's' specialty. It had the signature 'g'  of her approval.  Something fancy sounding and a 'pizza' of sorts called 'the Mortadella'. It was the equivalent of Oscar Meyer bologna with pistachios on a flat bread. No sauce. No olive oil.  Nothing else. It was clear that this was a pure money grab.   I now know why her smile is so big! Suckered into paying exorbitant prices to what was essentially an open face bologna sandwich. ($15 for the curious). Order for yourself if you don't believe me.   The burrata? A joke. The balsamic was disappointing.  It needed more, and was a not a balsamic I would've served with sea salt. Salt wasn't necessary,  good balsamic was. This was bad supermarket balsamic. un-aged, thin. There was just enough to make a small pretty spot. Amuse bouche? Rather amuse douche. Excuse my Fench.   We also ordered the gorganzola with fruit and honey. It was just ok. The honey needed to be much sweeter to meld the flavors together. If it wasn't for the presence of the wax, I almost thought it was store bought watered down honey.   All in all, the menu was really underwhelming.  The pairings were odd. And fancy names have no description because the Mortadella should be quite mortifying for a restaurant that seems to be so pretentious.  I can make bologna sandwich at home in PJs. I don't even eat this or buy this at home, only to get this here of all places, AND have to follow a dress code for this place.    So we got suckered by the fancy name and pretentious dress code thinking we were in for a treat. But instead got tricked.   Don't waste your time or money. Unless you are morbidly curious about overpaying for the bologna sandwich.  My bad. 'Mortadella pizza'.",

I had the short rib for my main course and it was perfectly cooked. The plate did need a pinch of salt but nothing to ruin the dish. My friends had the short rib as well as the rosiotto, all were pleased. I will return again to check out her brunch.",

Was a little concerned about the portion size, but I was pleasantly surprised in all fronts.  Our waiter, Joseph, was chatty, in a good way. Told us that there would be no rush to get us oh so enjoy our meal and time with family.   We first ordered drinks, all named after Dino DeLaurentis' movies. My daughter and I had the Barbarella, my husband had the Serpico and my son in law had the Conan with Vodka instead of Tequila. I loved my Barbarella  which is a riff on a Moscow Mule, but if you like Manhattan's the Serpico was to die for!!!  My husband begged for the recipe and they were kind enough to give it to him.   We opted for the $120 tasting menu and it was better than anything I expected!! Antipasto plate, yummy with one of four kinds each.  The pasta course, we had all three varieties, rigatoni good, but lemon shrimp was wonderful!!   Bread tray comes with all kinds of cute accoutrements, but I loved the lemon marscapone butter!!   Then we all ordered the tenderloin, cooked perfectly with some asparagus and snap peas with it. The sides were sensational.   For dessert you get 3 choices from a dessert cart. Lots of gelato and sorbet, cookies, tiramisu and much more!   It was a glorious night, a little pricier than I usually go, but I was glad that my experience was not sketchy at all.   And with the tasting menu, you get a fancy portfolio with recipes (ours included the lemon ricotta cookie and the heavenly smashed potatoes! ) plus an autographed photo of Giada herself!",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant (but you sort of expect that in Vegas) and a pretty decent view of the Bellagio water show from the main room, though partially obstructed by a walkway overpass. Other than the setting and service, I can't say I was very impressed. If it weren't for her name being all over the place I don't think this restaurant would be as successful.  For apps we went with the charred octopus which was quite tender, some wonderful burrata with balsamic salt, and a salumi plate.  Pasta dishes being what Giada is famous for, we decided to order a few of her classics and forgo the entrees as they didn't seem very interesting or appetizing. As she is also known for her dramatic pronunciation of pastas, it was funny to see the pronunciations spelled out on the menu.   After much deliberation, we ordered the \"spah-geh-tee,\" the \"ree-ZOHT-oh,\" and the \"tohr-teh-LEE-nee.\" The risotto was hopelessly undercooked and underseasoned with the crab and scallops very sparse. The spaghetti was okay, but this was supposed to be \"the\" dish. The massive prawns that accompanied the pasta weren't very warm but were clearly overcooked. I enjoyed the tortellini with kabocha squash and crispy prosciutto most--maybe because it was drenched in brown butter.  My wife is a fan of Giada and has a couple of her cookbooks (we even attended a book signing), but from now on we'll stick to making the dishes ourselves. They turn out better that way and are a hell of a lot cheaper.",

When we were taken to our table, the iPad cocktail menu was not working.  We didn't receive a working menu until almost 20 minutes later after asking twice.  The menu was limited, as they were out of two mains and one side dish. We were not given appetizer plates and had to use our bread plates.  We were seated next to a server's station and we heard the servers speaking negatively about their tables all night long.  Their conversations and behavior were very generic and did not live up to my expectations at a restaurant of this caliber.  The food was good, the experience was less than ok.

Like others we made a reservation for two and were kept waiting about 10 minutes. The ambience is incredible. Seriously so pretty and so well thought out.   However, I really thought the food would be incredible as well. We started with an anti-pasta meat and cheese platter. The mustard on there was delicious. The signature cocktails were full of layers. Awesome.   Then the charred octopus came out. No sauce just a small potato pasta. Thank god for the little potatoes. We didn't even finish the octopus it was so blah.   Lobster ravioli. Possibly undercooked. Or maybe the recipe calls for tougher ravioli. It could be something I wasn't used to. The sauce was not my favorite I felt as though it were missing something and just tasted a lot like butter.   28oz steak and the surf and turf next. His steak? Charred beyond edible. I tried it. I finally just forced him to say something, it's an 80 dollar steak you should like it. The waiter (David, phenomenal by the way) apologized and removed it while buying my date a drink. Impeccable staff. Still had anxiety doing it and felt horrible afterwards. Still he seemed understanding. My dish was cooked perfectly if you like sweeter sauce go for the surf and turf.   Greatest part? The chocolate tart. Get it. Worth it.   If it were not for David we would probably have left really disappointed. Hats off sir! Also our busboy was hilarious. If you're looking for five star go to Scarpetta at the Wynn.",

Was torn between appetizers and was swayed to the stuffed peppers, with a slight variation to keep them all veggie. Underwhelmed and regretted having ordered them. For an entree it was the rigatoni with a veggie ragu. I was really impressed that this was even an option, almost couldn't believe it. The sauce was great, the pasta, not so much. I had been warned that it is cooked al dente, but mine was undercooked even for that. Literally half cooked, gummy, pasta getting stuck in my teeth. Pushed around the pasta in order to just eat the ragu.   Nice atmosphere. Great bread. Good service. Probably wouldn't return on my next visit to Vegas.",

We arrived early and got drinks at the bar. We sat for 10 minutes before a server came. We noticed right away that it was hot in the restaurant. All of the windows were open and it was loud and uncomfortable. For drinks, I had the Giada and my husband had the Barbarella. The Barbarella was a fancy gin and tonic and the Giada was sweet and creamy...both very delicious.   We started dinner with the orzo meatballs, crab arancini, and frito misto. The meatballs were delicious. They were salty, tender, and the sauce was cheesy. The arancini was good but my family's recipe is better. The marinara it came with was bland. The coating on the calamari was grainy. Calamari should be fried in a light, flakey batter. It came with lemon aioli which was good but I prefer marinara with my calamari. They were very tender and flavorful, I just didn't like the coating. This dish was served with a delicious fennel and pepper salad. Skip the calamari please and give me more of that salad.   Then we had the romaine and tri colore salads. The romaine is Giada's take on a caesar salad. It was too lemony. The tri colore salad was delicious. It was served with kale, raddichio, proscuitto, and gorganzola. The proscuitto melted in your mouth and was salty and perfect.   For our entrees, we had lobster ravioli and lemon spaghetti. The lobster ravioli was good. The pasta was tender and they didn't skimp on the lobster. The spaghetti was raw. It stuck together and was chewy. The sauce was creamy and lemony and the shrimp were tender. I enjoyed the fried capers that were sprinkled around the plate. If my pasta was cooked this would have been delicious.   We wanted dessert but the service was terrible. We were in the restaurant for 2 hours at this point, it was extremely hot, and our water was poured warm without ice. We decided to take Giada's favorite cookies home. These were amazing. The lemon ricotta cookies were light and cakey and the peanut butter and blackberry jam cookies were soft and nutty. We received 2 of each and then 1 large chocolate chip cookie. I do not care for chocolate chip but this cookie was great. We paid $12 for 5 cookies...worth every penny.   I am giving Giada's 3 stars for the drinks and cookies. The food was overpriced and not very good and the restaurant was hot, loud, and the service was poor. Our bill was $207 and the meal just wasn't worth it. My Italian grandmother never liked Giada. Grandma used to say Giada was full of you know what. And Italian Grandmothers are never wrong.",

    "text": "I was really hoping to give this place five stars but it just didn't happen. I liked the experience overall but a couple of things left something to be desired.   We were  a party of four with an early dinner reservation. The ladies at the reservation desk were accommodating but had pretty much zero personality. I felt like they were all kind of miserable actually. We were seated fairly promptly and our waiter, Diego, came to our table within a minute or so. He was very friendly and gave some good ideas for what to order for appetizers and dinner. We ordered the orzo meatballs and fritto misto as appetizers. They were both absolutely delicious. The meatballs are FANTASTIC and I highly recommend them if you go! The bread platter they give really is delicious as well.   I ordered the lemon pasta with shrimp and the other three dinners were the veal, rigatoni with vegetable bolognese, and the surf & turf. I seemed to be the only one without the food euphoria upon taking the first bite of dinner. The pasta was just shy of al dente in the too firm direction and it was lukewarm. The sauce tasted good but I guess the cream in it gets it to be too thick/dry when it's not piping hot. The flavors were great but those aspects definitely impacted my desire to eat dinner. The shrimp were HUGE and one was more cooked through than the other. I don't typically pick apart meals like this but when you're paying that much for the food, I definitely expect it to be better than a $9 pasta meal at a pizzeria. The portions are definitely small so if you're expecting a big bowl of pasta, you're not getting it there. The surf and turf was a nice piece of filet mignon and one crab raviolo. One.   We didn't end up ordering dessert. In terms of drinks, I had the Barbarella with vodka rather than gin and my boyfriend had the destroyer. Both were very, vey good. I had an espresso after dinner and it was definitely some of the best I've had.   Oh, the only other down side is you're going to leave smelling like you were sitting outside at a bonfire. There's a wood burning stove or something and I left there smelling like I had been camping.   I would definitely go back and try it again. I might do lunch next time to try a different vibe and other menu items. It's worth a trip if you're in Vegas and are looking for an expensive meal.",

The ambiance and the decor at the restaurant was classy and upscale yet managing to stay warm and inviting.  We did the tasting menu and everything was delicious. And then when that dessert cart came around, we were like kids wanting everything in sight.  But what took our experience to the next level is the service that we got at our table with Cliff...he was instantly warm and inviting with his great big smile. He went above and beyond in accommodating me with vegetarian options in the tasting menu, making sure I was not left out and had plenty to eat. He also recommended these yummy St. Germaine spritzers for an anniversary toast.  These are just a few things that made our experience at Giada's memorable and when in Vegas again, we certainly will be back to dine at this restaurant.",

    "text": "We had a reservation for 6:30 PM on Friday August 14th.  Were seated once entire party arrived at a large bare table in a corner next to a wall that had a movie picture on it.  We are all excited to try this place, the waiter comes over and introduces himself asks if we want sparkling or plain water asked about wine cocktails, etc etc.   We get our drinks ordered and order a couple of the platter style appetizers.   That was the last pleasant experience we had.   We were brought our bread on the board, the slat bread fell off the board onto the table with no linens on it and the server picks them up with her hand and puts them back on the board We were never brought a plate to place our bread on while eating We received our soups/salads, by a very flustered server who we had to tell what person ordered what. When we were done with our soups/salads the staff just took our silverware off the plate and placed on the table.  There are no linens on the table.  Why are we not getting new silverware with each course.   They staff never cleaned the table between courses either.  So if someone dropped something on the table during bread service, appetizer service, or salad and soup service it was going to stay there the entire meal.  Again, how much am I paying for this? Staff was horrible about refilling water glasses, had to ask multiple times when we could find someone that we needed more water.  Our meals came, our sides came, no plates to put the sides on again though.   We had to ask the staff to remove the bread board to make more room on the table, and they seemed irritated to have to remove them. Desert came (Souffle, Chocolate Tart) we were sharing around the table, no plates again.    I finally see our original waiter and tell him what horrible service we had and he told me the reason our service was bad was because his \"helper\" went home sick and he had to do it all himself.   Our bill comes I see that we are being charged for water.   Water that we had to keep flagging down a waiter to give us.  I go and speak with a manager named George, who tells me they are very busy tonight and this excuse and that excuse, and that I should write a honest review about the experience and he would take a look at my bill.  He told me he would be right back.   5-7 minutes pass and no George.  I ask the hostess where George went she said Oh he hasn't came back yet, I said no, she was like oh here is another one of my managers (Female didn't get her name) She said he will be right up.   Waiting around, Geroge comes back up and says he took 20% off the bill (Which would cover the tip) and took water charges off bill, shows me the bill, and the 20% off was there but the water was not credited.  He said Oh I thought I did that I am sure I did that it must just be on another receipt.  At this point I am done my clients are done, I think Geroge is done.   I have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant.   The fact that there is the Giada name on this restaurant, one would think the service would be up to par that is associated with the name and the prices being charged.",

Margaritas were a bit strong (in booze and in price) but food was delicious. The mini pizza was very tasty - each ingredient stood out: dough, mozzarella, tomato, basil. The tricolore kale salad was fresh and crunchy. We also ordered small cheese plates: parmigiano and gorgonzola. They were served with lavender honey which made their taste burst out - a culinary tip I'll be sure to remember at home. As kitchen closing time neared, we were asked whether we'd like to order anything else... A really sweet touch that we really appreciated. So aside from the rather steep prices (USD 19 for a margarita!) we enjoyed our meal at Giada.",

We ordered drinks (a cider and sangria). Both were tasty and well-presented. There's a lot of ice in the sangria however, so there's not much sangria to drink. We also had them bring a Waldorf salad, and it came before we'd had more than a couple sips of our drinks, then the entrees (the grilled cheese sandwich and a lobster roll) arrived almost immediately. They were pretty good. It was not the dining experience we expected. Far too rushed. Then it was time for dessert. Tiramisu, and the gelato/sorbet were delicious, but where was the espresso and cappuccino we ordered? It came well after the desserts ... and we kind of expected them to be hot drinks. Not so. Then it was time to pay. $115 plus tip. Years ago they would have called this yuppie food. Both the service and food paled against the dinner we had at Hugo's Cellar a couple nights before, for $135 plus tip.",

    "text": "I love watching Giada on TV and could not wait to dine at her LV restaurant.  I panned a 60th birthday party for my cousin there last Friday evening for party of 5 at 5pm.  I flew to Las Vegas from TX for this party and was on my way to the Cromwell when the restaurant called to ask if we could make our reservations for another day.  I immediately let them know that was not possible as this as a 60th birthday party and had been planned for at least a month.  The hostess that called said they had a problem in the kitchen and had to cancel our reservations.  Evidently there was a pipe that burst.  i asked what time the restaurant would open and the said 5:30.  I replied that we would change our reservations to 5:30.  She said that was not possible because 5:30 already full.  I could not believe her lack of empathy and respect for me as a customer.  She informed me that I could come but I would not get a table.  There was no accommodation at all, no offer to find another restaurant in the hotel, or in the area, nothing.  She was cold as ice.  So here we are Easter weekend, at 4:30 on a Friday, trying to scramble and find someone where to host a party on the LV Strip.  To make a long story short, we ended up having to call everyone and we had to go to a local restaurant off the strip that was nothing special.  It was a totally disappointment.  I don't believe she wants hername associated with a restaurant that doesn't know who to speak with,  nor treat customers.",

    "text": "Dinner reservation was made on-line for 5:45pm. When we arrived, we were asked to wait another 15 minutes which was not a problem as we spent time in the photo booth. This was a great idea BTW. After more than 15 minutes, my husband had to ask about our table as we were not called back. At that point, one of the hostesses whom we spoke originally that was standing there the entire time realized that we were waiting, so she called us up, and we followed her into the restaurant. The place was packed. We were seated by the windows, which were opened (not so good idea). We seat down, after adjusting our table as we could not freely fit into the space. The amount of space allowed for those double tables was limited, and taken by larger individuals on either side. We both tall & skinny, but had to come up with own solution seating down. When we walked in, we liked the decor, and we had good feelings; however after seating down, we were not given any menu, and we were left alone. No one has showed up for about 15 minutes, and at that point brought us cocktails & wine list. Cocktails are $15.00 & small. Wine prices (per glass) range from $18.00 and up (large glasses, but very little wine). Wine prices per bottle very high!  Complimentary selection of breads (2 kinds only with extra condiment) very good & delicious, but arrived 30 minutes after first table encounter. We had to ask for them. Seeing white jacket service, high prices, but no white clothes tables made me feel like something was not right. Table service seemed overwhelmed, and forgetful. We had to focus to understand our waiter. He was nice, but in wrong profession. We had no connection with any of the staff; they came & went away; almost felt like everyone was under pressure, doing their jobs but without any good execution. Fellow, who operated desert cart, was the only one that was having fun while working.   Planning on having a romantic dinner and/or conversations? Giada restaurant is not the place due to very high level of noise. The combination of outside & inside noise was unbearable & left me with a headache. It was hard to seat through.   Desert options very limited and not so exceeding. My tiramisu was not what I have expected, and was extremely sweet. I enjoyed my specialty orange coffee though, but had to wait for them to make it.   Artichoke soup, Lobster raviolis, and Risotto were excellent. I will give 5 stars!    Service experience needs serious improvement, and needs to smile in my opinion. Overall experience low, and one time experience only at this point.",

    "text": "After a great dinner experience at Giada's restaurant last year, I suggested to my friend that we go check out her place for breakfast. We were so excited on our walk from the Bellagio but once we got up the escalator at the Cromwell things started to go downhill. We arrived and the hostess said that if we wanted to sit at a table we had to wait til 9:00. I asked what time it was currently and she said 8:54 but we had to wait 6 minutes to get a table. When we were being led to the dining area, we expected it to be busy and that was why we were asked to wait. There were two other tables with diners. The entire restaurant was empty. We found it odd that we had to wait over 6 minutes to be seated in a near-empty restaurant that opened an hour before we got there.   We ordered mimosas, which was delicious, and then asked our waitress to bring us one of the fresh pastries to have before our main dishes arrived. The menu says that you can order one pastry or four pastries. I specifically said one and the waitress brought us four. We decided that we needed to send 3 of them back because there was no way that two of us could eat four pastries and then eat our main breakfasts. So we flagged down our waitress and explained that we said we wanted only one pastry. Our smiling waitress all of a sudden had a pissed off look on her face and started arguing us about the pastries. We told her it said you could order one on the menu and then she got all huffy and puffy about having to take back 3 of the 4. One of the bussers asked her what happened about 8 feet from our table. And she hid behind a column obviously complaining about us. The rest of the meal she didn't go out of her way to provide any great service to us which we thought was absurd since the whole ordeal was her mistake.   My friend and I both enjoyed our entrees but there are plenty of other breakfasts in Vegas that are on par or better than Giada's. I would return for lunch or dinner but think I'll skip breakfast next time!",

You get greeted at the door, and they bring you to the table and the staff is super friendly and the hospitality is #1. Avi the general manager came around and introduced himself and made sure everything is fine.   Giada herself made a round and I was able to take a photo.  Actually she took the selfie photo and was super friendly and sweet. She looked busy and she really cares about this place because she was talking to all of the staff. The staff knew the menu well, and gave great recommendations, and they knew their wine pairing s with the food.  They are super staffed and are alert on what is going on as in food coming on time, drinks being filled up, and the timing was all perfect as the food came out.  The pasta was fresh, the soup and salad was amazing and just the right portions.  Make sure you leave room for the dessert!!! They have an amazing dessert cart that comes around and everything was made fresh and healthy.   I had the polenta cake with the fresh coffee gelato.   This is one of the trendiest hottest new restaurants in Vegas. The best part of it is the location because you get natural light and it is not dark and dingy like the rest of the trendy Vegas restaurants.  The food is fresh, homemade, and amazing.  The best Staff! Super friendly and nice.",

    "text": "Being Italian myself and a huge Giada fan I couldn't wait to come to Vegas and dine at her restaurant.   When I first walked in I was impressed by how she honored her grandmother and grandfather by having their movie posters hanging on the walls.   Once inside we were seated at a table for two and was greeted by the waiter.  However, he didn't offer us a cocktail menu with the dinner menu.  When he asked if we wanted a cocktail I had to ask for it and then waited a while to get it and for him to take our order.  Appetizers were good especially the crab aranchini.   The entre options were good however what you get for the price is very small portions.  I paid $25.00 for a fistful of bucatini and the branzino fish was really dry.  Once we were finished I had to ask the server to clean our placemat as he was placing our dessert silver ware down.  If I hadn't asked I don't think he would have done it.   For dessert we ordered the lemoncello souffle which was well worth the 17 minute wait.  That was by far one of the best desserts i've ever had.  The people next to us ordered the cookies which looked really good and since Giada is a pastry chef by education, I don't think we would have been disappointed had we ordered those.   My rating is basically low due to the service and the small portions for the price you pay.  The dining experience wasn't what I had expected but I definitely would give it another try.",

    "text": "We dined here for our anniversary and am so glad we did!  First of all, my husband made a reservation but didn't write down the confirmation # and at check-in, there was no record of it.  We were very disappointed but immediately, the host manager told us she would work us in in about 20 minutes.  We walked into the restaurant and loved seeing the kitchen; same idea as the Eiffel Tower restaurant.  We sat at the bar and met two bartenders.  The male was terrific and very easy-going, personable, and loved telling about the drinks and the atmosphere - very engaging and you could tell he loved working there.  Sadly, the female that ended up making our drinks was not like that.  She would giggle and say she didn't know certain things about the restaurant and she seemed very clumsy while making our cocktails.  My husband had a rum drink that looked like a snow cone which was super cool (and tasty) and I had the Destroyer, which was made with tequila.  I think it could have been made better and muddled more, but the ingredients/idea were awesome.  The host manager came to the bar and took us to our table.  We sat just above the actual dining room but as close to it as possible.  My husband had an actual chair but I sat facing him on the couch/bench seat.  Those need lumbar cushions!  It was not ideal for eating.  We had the pleasure of having both Josephs serve us and they were both equally amazing, funny, respectful, kind, smart... everything you'd want and expect from fine dining servers.  We also met a Sommelier, Darius, and he, too, was amazing.  I would like to give an extra special shout out to Juan, who delivered our bread.  He knew every single type of bread and all condiments, he was lovely, smiled, and answered our questions.  I got the impression he was a bit nervous and lacks confidence, but he is a gem!  He will soon become a terrific server, without a doubt.  He was far more knowledgable and personable than the female bartender, that's for sure!  The overall atmosphere was a bit confusing to me.  Was it trying to be a club?  The music was distracting to me.  The decor was *not* what I would have expected after seeing Giada's TV set, and I truly hated seeing her name or initial everywhere.  I liked the white on white napkins with her name, and I liked her name on the To-Go bags, but did not care for it at all on the back of the bar stools or on some of the dishes/plates.   Now to the food... 10 Stars for that!  We started with the grilled octopus, which was indescribable!  We will order that again, and again, and again.  We also had the gorgonzola dolce, which was terrific.  For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli and I ate every single last bite.  The pasta was delicate and the lobster was plentiful.  My husband had the veal saltimbocca.  He ate it all but said he wouldn't order it again as it was pan-fried.  And for dessert, we had a variety of cookies, and the lemon ricotta one was out of this world, but we also had the honey almond chocolate ganache tart.  O.  M.  G.  !!!  I wanted to make my house out of it.  It was so delicious and a perfect balance of creamy and crunchy.  I would go to Giada's again just for dessert and order that tart.   Food = out of this world.  Servers = amazing  Bartender = 1 great, 1 not Atmosphere = tried to be different than your traditional Italian fine dining but became too eclectic for me.",

Finally one whole hour later out entrees arrived and were a huge disappointment. We had the chicken between two for $72.

We tried to walk in to get a table for four but they said that you needed to have reservations and the next reservation was three hours from now or we could sit at the bar. That made me think that if the restaurant was packed it was probably because the food is delicious or something so we decided to eat at the bar. The four of us sat in the bar area and the service was extremely slow there. I ordered the risotto ($28) which was very salty. My friend ordered the $32 pappardelle which was very bland. We also tried the tortellini which was probably the best thing we ate but, still just all right. None of us thought our food was anything to rave about. Specially when you are in Las Vegas paying $30 for a plate of pasta. Add a drink and appetizer and you are looking at over $50 a person for subpar food. The only thing that saved the meal for us was a bread platter that they bring to you which has breadsticks and a crostini as an appetizer. That gave this place the extra star because that was the best food item we ate.  So sad because Giada is always on tv shows so I assumed that she was a good chef.",

He took some pictures for us that turned out great as well. Our server, Tim, was fantastic. He explained the menu in great detail and always seemed to show back up at our table at just the right time. We had the Valentine's day tasting menu, which was great. The desserts were absolutely the highlight. The hazelnut macaroon had the perfect blend of bitter dark and sweet chocolate. The strawberry dessert was one of the best treats either of us had ever tried. This was our first time at Giada, it will certainly not be our last.",

    "text": "Entering Giada, we were welcomed by the scent of old-world style cured meats and fresh artisan bread. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. Friendly staff escorted us to a table in under a minute where we were immediately offered water. Opening the drink menu, we took the opportunity to sip ice-cold cocktails, inspired by the films \"Serpico\" and \"La Strada\". We informed our server - Rocco S. - that my Wife has celiac sprue, and were thrilled when he referred us to the numerous Gluten-wise options on the menu. We commenced with Roasted Eggplant Parmigiana (very nice smokey bite with scamorza cheese) and Charred Octopus - a favorite because of the delicate balance between the rich meatiness of the squid and the bright acidity of the shaved fennel and lemon aioli. Next, it was time for wine and I was pleased to find a broad list, including several reasonably-priced mid-market selections. When our vino arrived we were ready to order mains, electing to indulge in fresh pasta - mine the Lobster Ravioli and hers; the Gluten-free Shrimp Spaghetti. (By far the best GF pasta she has ever tried) Both were decadent, rich and satisfying, prepared perfectly - just on the soft side of a firm bite. Our side selections were equally enjoyable diversions, being the Sweet Corn and Sausage and the Artichoke. Again, a perfect balance between the sweet, smokey sausage bite and the light, citrus-imbued artichokes. Not being let down by a single taste and knowing it may be quite a while until our return to Giada, we decided to relax with coffee and a macaroon dessert as well as ordering additional food to take with us. I asked Rocco S. what his \"go-to\" protein on the menu would be and he described the Milanese Veal Chop. I was sold! The traditional, breaded chop (which I sadly could not share with my lovely lady!,) had an excellent, dark crunch on the outside, complimented by large flakes of Parmesan adorning the top, enveloping the warm, velvety explosion of perfectly cooked veal. This is a dish I will no doubt crave for some time. Giada offers the ultimate culinary experience, with depths of flavor and a level of service that restored our appreciation for dining out. We will return at every opportunity. Our only regret - we didn't get a chance to meet Giada!",

Our reservation was for 8:15pm on October 24th, 2015 we didn't got seated till 8:30 pm the seating was horrible. We were  seated against a wall on a booth couch/table  the cushion  was split on the middle, very uncomfortable even the couple next to us said that they fought with the cushion as well very uncomfortable. The service is very slow we ordered drinks at 8:35pm  and we didn't get our drinks till 9pm. We decided to do the 5 course dinner but the timing between each course was very long. Only once our server came to our table to see if we need it something else.  We had empty glasses of our alcoholic beverages but he never asked if we want it another one, he seems to be busy with a table full of beautiful ladies, the service at that table was very good.  I also requested a special dessert platter for our anniversary with our reservation but they didn't acknowledged our request. Sadly we had a expensive dinner but it was no magic. The food was good.",

We ordered a few dishes to share: a pizzette, octopus antipasti and spaghetti dish. Spicy sausage pizzette was delicious and perfectly cooked with piquillo peppers, mozzarella, and tomatoes. Charred octopus panzanella (antipasti dish) came as a salad with tomatoes and asparagus dressed in a vinaigrette.  I was not aware it was a cold dish so I didn't enjoy this dish. I usually eat octopus warm or in ceviche.   We wanted to try one of Giada's specialty dishes so we order the spaghetti (shrimp, mascarpone cheese, lemon and basil). The lemon sauce was different but delicious. the plate was served warm and beautifully presented.    We noticed that everyone around us was getting a tray of different types of bread with spreads so by the end of our meal we asked the bartender about it. He told us that the tray is only delivered upon request but we never knew about this because he didn't inform us. I didn't get to try the beautiful tray of bread for lack of information but by the time we found out about it we were too full to request it.   The restaurant is beautiful and the cocktails list is very nice. Overall, it seems like a good restaurant but we did not have a great experience. I guess it is a hit or miss in this place.",

You can't go wrong with any of their dishes really. Just pick one that you think you will like and you will most definitely enjoy it.

Contrary to other people who say that it is not that much food, my wife and I barely make it the dessert cart where you pick out anything you want and as much as you want of it.

The complimentary bread served with dried capers, pesto, butter, red pepper flakes, and salt was a nice touch to the typical bread and butter you get at most restaurants. In addition to the bread we enjoyed some burrata cheese and the frito misto. The calamari was well seasoned and very tender. The main entrees we ordered were the lobster ravioli and the fettuccine. Both pasta dishes were amazing, but my recommendation goes to the fettuccini.  The pasta was cooked to perfection, the sauce was delectable, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Their freshly prepared pasta is what sets their dishes apart from most other Italian establishments. The portions were just right. Service was impeccable. Our server Rado was extremely knowledgeable and his recommendations were on par. My wife enjoyed, not one, but two old fashioned drinks (recommendation courtesy of Rado). Their desserts sounded tempting, but the feast left us no room for a post dinner treat. We will definitely save room at our next visit. Up to this point our dining experience was beyond our expectations, but the icing on the tiramisu was a visit from John Davila, restaurant manager. I appreciate the added touch when management is genuinely interested in our experience. He was extremely friendly and made us feel like family. Thank you John and Rado for an amazing night. We will definitely be back to try the other amazing options Giada's has to offer.",

He also let me use my yelp check in and I got 2 free cookies which where delish! My good tastes great. Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "The interior is phenomenal. Even the table setting is fancy with the custom table mat. It's aesthetically very detailed and so clean. Great lighting and very picture worthy. While you wait for your table to get ready, they offer a free photo booth to shoot you and two other friends. I recommend searching on Groupon like our group did to get the best deals and to lower the cost of the ticket. Totally worth.  The food is definitely not your average entree price range. It can range from $20-$60. There are complimentary rosemary bread and these thin fried cheese?? crackers that come with sides like butter, pesto olive, and salt etc. I ordered the bucatini and it is straightforward just like the menu said. The pasta noodles are incredibly thick. I was a bit disappointed with the dish because there wasn't much depth in the flavors... and it was just a weird proportion of sauce and pasta. Too much pasta. The lobster ravioli was good but less salt could have been used. But you could still taste the freshness of the lobster. On top of the ravioli there is fried pork skin. It was kind of weird because the crunch was nice but knowing it was pork fat was not entirely enjoyable. The cheese tortellini pasta dish was good. The cream was good but of course the ravioli filling could have used less salt.   Overall, the restaurant is 3 stars. I even read some of the 2K reviews before coming in with an open mind but I was disappointed. I liked how fancy the interior was but I probably won't come back here.",

They couldn't give an answer why a waffle, crab cake, and omelet took forty minutes.   I ordered the crab cake and my god, it was so awfully burned... The \"seasonal vegetables\" were just the most averagely-prepared potatoes ever. It would've been worth the wait and price if the food was exceptional, but I felt like I've had more satisfying meals at the Cheesecake Factory and Giada is already so expensive, I probably should've considered CF instead.   They gave us a plate of cookies for dessert, but I didn't feel like it was the right approach to make the situation right. We have severe peanut allergies, so to assume this is what should be done was a little bit presumptuous (ESPECIALLY if your restaurant is more upscale).   Ugh - for a $120 meal (3 people), 40 minute wait and burned food, I pass. Pass, pass, pass.",

Nothing super special (hunk of cheese and some sliced meat, salad tossed in vinaigrette, 4 small pastries) . Worse it was served at same time.  Savory (salad) with sweets (pastries).  Wtf?  Not worth it. At all.   Entrees were good.  Burger was solid.  Pesto pasta was very rich.  The salmon Benedict was actually outstanding.  But it was only $20 on the regular menu.  So why did I pay $55???  Deserts were good but not super special.  Worth eating.  So here is the secret:  Forget the tourist trap tasting menu.  Order an entree for each person a la carte. Share a dessert between two people.  And order an app or two to your liking for the table.    You'll get great food, in the right quantities, and just to your liking, for far less than the \"tasting\" experience.  I'll be back.  But will just order a la carte.  I suggest you do the same.",

The Pizette, Caprese Salad and Scallops were good.  The food was beautifully presented, especially the Tiramisu Cheesecake.       The not so good (well still 'ok' but we expected more - see comment above):   Service was very slow and we seemed to be forgotten unless they were bringing out a course.

    "text": "Food was very good and fresh, but it was waaay overpriced for the lousy service and incredibly small portions. $26 for a half portion of a vegetable bolognese pasta!!! $13 for a non-alcoholic cocktail that was mostly large cubes of ICE!!!  If you want a nice meal in a classy joint with GOOD service and decent portions, head over to B&B at the Venetian, any of the fine restaurants at the Wynn/Encore resorts. OR if you really want the fabulous Strip view - go to Mon Ami Gabi or a Bellagio restaurant instead.   As foodie vegetarians, we are used to 5 star restaurants and paying for smaller portions of higher quality foods with stellar service, but this place took this to an extreme. We were intrigued by the lovely looking antipasto bar that is displayed at the front, and also because they profess to have vegan and gluten-free options. So on a slow Thursday night, we tried to use the online reservation system - but it was not working, so we dropped in around 8:00ish... They said they had no availability for the rest of the evening. Not even to wait for a table? They did not suggest the bar. But when we asked if they served food at the bar, they seemed as if they had never thought of this. And why... yes, they did. As we were guided to the bar, we saw many empty tables - WHICH by the end of our meal many were still were empty!!! And during this walk, not once did Scott?, our host, mention, that the bar did not serve the full menu.  After we were seated, the menu seemed small by comparison to the food we saw displayed. We asked if there was another menu? We saw more selections up front. They said no, this was it. Later we learned after our meal - there WAS another menu, but they did not offer it at the bar. Being that the bar was so small (and there was only 1 other couple seated there - the place was half empty.), we were pretty incredulous that they would not offer a full menu at it.  The bar waiter seemed more interested in having conversations with the other bar staff then being a decent waiter. Several times we were sitting there trying to get his attention to get a water refill, get lemons, get bread, for a check, etc. only to have to flag down other bus and bar staff to get things accomplished.  The manager came over at the beginning of our meal and introduced himself, and again just before we left to ask how everything was. By that point, we didn't want to complain - we just wanted out...  After dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu. the waiter said yes, and then never brought one over and or said anything else for that matter. Several minutes later, we asked again and he said, you have to wait to look at the dessert cart. I knew I had seen something on the menu posted out front that I wanted. I kept asking to look at a dessert menu and they kept saying there was none. Then I asked if I could look at the dinner menu again, and they asked me why!!!  Eventually one bus boy said, \"Well, I could go to the dinner table section and try to get you a paper menu. I said please do, but he promptly forgot and never did.  Another bizarre thing... I asked the dessert cart guy where the ladies room was. He said he would walk me over to it. I said, no thank you. Again, he insisted on walking me to it. I figured it really must be hidden or difficult to find? So he walked me over to the door in plain view just off the entrance. I did not require an escort.  The food flavor and quality was indeed 5 star, but everything else: 1 star. PASS.",

Greg and Valentino with their boyish good looks really complimented Bryan's style of service. Felt like the Rat Pack was back in town and serving at Giada. Avi the manager also stopped by and was incredibly welcoming. Other than that the room was beautiful. And in case you're intoxicated by the service and forget where you're at, Giada's name is everywhere to help remind you. Food was ok not going to blow anyone away. Definitely a house wive sanctuary. But if you ask for one of the Rat Pack as your server you're sure to have a great time.",

First time the two ladies in the front were rude and couldn't care less if we stayed or left, but the waitress was great. Second time was pretty nice although the waiter was pretty preoccupied and it seemed like he didn't have time for our table  .  Yesterday, since we stayed at the Cromwell and it was raining, we decided to give it another try. The restaurant was pretty busy so we sat at the bar and ordered food. Everything was going good until my husband made the mistake of inquiring about grappa. Instead of suggesting or explaining about the kind of grappas the establishment had, the bartender put FIVE bottles in front of us and LEFT.  After sitting there for almost 10 minutes, we asked a different bartender passing by if we were supposed to help ourselves. He rudely asked which one we wanted  Baffled by the nastiness, we told him we didn't know the difference in the five kinds. He turned around and took all five bottles! A minute later came back with one, ready to pour a glass. NO Thank  You!!!! It is very sad and unfortunate for this restaurant that the service  is so poor! It is astonishing how a well known chef and owner of a dining establishment can't hire better people to make her restaurant famous not just because of the name and food but also for the exceptional service.   VERY DISAPPOINTING indeed because the food is dynamite!!!!",

    "text": "This was my second time to Giada, first visit was a dinner in September which was good.  The recent visit was lunch on Sunday November 30th.  First, you need to hire reception gals with a friendly personality and not an \"attitude.\"  There were three of us and we ordered 3 different lunch items.  The lasagna was OVERPRICED and VERY small portion......absolutely NOTHING special.  The pizza was OVERPRICED and VERY small..............want good pizza in Vegas?  Go to Spago for one,,,,,far better!!  The Waldorf salad was something I'd get for $6.00 anywhere else.......not $16......   The only good part was our waitress was great but then I grew up in the restaurant business so would never go to a restaurant just for a good waitress!!  I think the novelty of this restaurant will fade with being so overpriced for mediocre food and small portions.  Too much competition in Vegas.   I left feeling like \"I was robbed!\"    The greatest compliment to any establishment is a return visit.  We will NOT be returning to Giada's!!!!!",

A friendly greeting from the staff at the top of the stairs. We'd only have to wait a few minutes for our table with out a reservation.   We found the photo booth in the lobby and had some fun taking and emailing photos for free!   As promised our table was ready by the time it took to send the photo.   Joseph was our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I've ever met. Warm, friendly, and he shared his favorites on the menu.   The food reminded me of my cooking Giadas recipes from her cookbooks although the professionals here made them taste so much better!   Giadas recipes are a different take on Italian dishes. There's a nice bread plate prior to the meal with warm olive oil and basil fresh from the oven! Yum!  We ordered caprese salad, surf and turf and Giadas cookies for desert. Everything was excellent. Especially the waitstaff.  We always had our water glasses topped off. Our plates were cleared promptly too.   Joseph was kind enough to have the chef write Happy Anniversary on the cookie plate!    The food and staff are superb.  It's a pricey menu but this is Las Vegas. What would you expect?   1/2 star less for the smell of cigarettes coming up from the casino.",

I was so looking forward to an amazing dinner out with my husband last night.  After all, we were in town to celebrate my birthday at this dinner (we had these reservations for over 3 months).  We were seated in probably the worst placed table in the restaurant.  Right next to the waiter station.  My chair was kicked repeatedly in the 15 minutes we were there.  We sat at our table for 17 total minutes without even receiving menus.  Congratulations Giada, it took you a whole 17 minutes to ruin my birthday dinner and leave my husband and I scrambling for new last minute dinner reservations.",

They do tell u the pasta dishes are small.... I had to order a 2nd plate of spaghetti for my daughter. I ordered Surf and Turf. If my steak was 2 inches in size that was a lot. The surf portion was 1 crab ravioli with the miniature steak. $56.00. The lemon potatoes were lousy and inedible. The hostesses at the front had no personality and we had to wait. We didn't know photo booth was free either. The cocktails were delish and about $15.00 a drink. My bill was $524.00 + a $100.00 tip. After paying $624.00 we all left there hungry!  I'm sorry Giada.... We won't be back again.",

The food, OMG, delicious, we start with lobster aranchini, yummy, arugula salad which was incredible. For a main course we tried the salmon and branzino ( medeterenian seabas ), cocked to perfection, but the service made our night. Thank u Radoslav , for the great suggestions and excellent service, we are locals and defiantly we'll be back soon. Great spot, graet food, great experience, great service!

    "text": "Disappointing and overpriced. WE LEFT HUNGRY!  Lunch service took 2 hours (and the restaurant was not busy). The menu is hard to understand, and the portions are very small. If you are craving pasta, do not come here, better off going to Ferraro's, Bootleggers or the Bautistas around the corner. THERE IS NO PASTA ON THE LUNCH MENU. Lunch for 2 was $100.00 and we left hungry.   AS for DINNER, we were lucky enough to get a reservation through a connection and be seated at 6pm on a Saturday night as opposed to waiting until the end of November for the next available seating prior to 11pm.  However, dinner service was equally as disappointing as lunch. The 4 of us each had a signature cocktail, a small appetizer, a small main dish, one bottle of wine and tea party type dessert and the total bill was $600.00. We left hungry....  Having the opportunity to experience both lunch and dinner, I would not recommend this place to anyone. So sad, come on Giada! I now understand why she is so petite if these are the portion sizes. I ordered tortellini and there were 5 tiny pieces. The desert cart was filled with treats probably purchased at the grocery store. Not impressed.   Servers are friendly, but inattentive. Lots of waiting. Decor and ambiance is a mess, Lacking theme and continuity. Her signature \"G\" is everywhere, way overused.   The best part of the restaurant is the photo booth!",

We wore pants and shoes but could have gotten away with less. It was also almost 100 outside so understandable. We ordered the mozzarella platter which was amazing. Only knock was the spicy sauce might have overpowered the mozzarella taste but I didn't mind the added flavor. We got the salumi pizza and a salad. The pizza was really good, dough was on point, toppings were good only thing is the bottom I would've liked slightly more crispy (slight preference on my part). Also for dessert we got the tiramisu and zeppoles. The tiramisu presentation was nice but was just okay the zeppoles were yummy. Kind of like a malasada/beignet with chocolate. Also the photo booth in the waiting area was a nice touch to add to a great meal",

I would have preferred classical or at least Italian music vs what was played which was modern pop and r&b music. Their motto was 'eat a little bit of everything, and not to much of anything' which probably explains why the portions were extremely tiny. I ordered the salmon which was delicious BUT was still hungry afterwards. The waiter had told us that the desserts were share-able -so my boyfriend and i ordered a Lemon bunt cake to share- but we were surprised to see a tiny sliver of cake that we ate with literally 3 bites -and that was around $13.  On top of that, the waiter spilled our cream (for coffee) and never cleaned it up, and broke a few glasses while walking around our table.  It was extremely over priced for the amount you receive (one cup/coffee was $6-and refills are NOT free). It was a shame that we couldn't decide what to tip our horrible waiter; a charge of $61 was added to our bill of over $400 for his tip!  over priced, tiny portions and horrible service But ambiance and the view were beautiful.",

The cuisine is italian style but it's just not anything to write home about.  We tried some nice cheeses, the bread platter that comes out is lovely baked with rosemary.  But, I'm not trying to pay $80 per head for good bread.  Some ordered the surf 'n' turf, others the risotto, and pizzas.  The specialty is a shrimp lemon spaghetti - it's presentation is photo worthy but the taste is just Meh.  For a restaurant that's $35 per plate on average, it's not worth it.  I suggest going for drinks and maybe some cheese and charcuterie style appetizers.",

I was extremely disappointed in the lack of flavor in all the food especially what was supposed to be one of her signature dishes, the lemon spaghetti. No flavor at all.  I squeezed extra lemon from a slice I had for my water and put more pepper which helped a little.  The Caprese salad lacked any seasoning and the yellow tomato soup was so small, it was unbelievable for the price and also lacked flavor. Everything was high priced and very small portions so you had to order more than one thing. My husband and our friends all gave it a thumbs down and of all the restaurants we ate at our entire trip, this was the worst. I expected so much more flavor from Giada's food. I will say that the waiter tried to make it right by giving us one free dessert for everyone to try and it was quite good with chocolate, peanut butter pie. I will not go back and would discourage anyone from going for 3 reasons:extremely pricey; very small portions; and very bland, lack of flavor.",

They started us with fresh hot bread, butter, oils, etc which melted in your mouth.  The wine and drink selection was great and even though I went against my better judgement of ordering a Riesling, it did not disappoint and 4 glasses later, it was still an amazing wine choice.  We decided to go with a tasting menu which is a limited set menu of appetizers, a 2nd and 3rd course and desserts from the dessert cart.  Every bite was amazing.   One of our party has a gluten allergy and we were all so impressed with how well they accommodated her and she was so overwhelmed by how amazing the gluten free options tasted.  The best part of the whole experience was our server, Rocco S.  I can honestly say that I have never received service as good as what we got at Giada's.  Rocco went above and beyond to ensure that all of our drinks and food were out on time and his knowledge of the dishes and the wine and his quiet, pleasant and humble demeanor just made our night.  It's a restaurant that is definitely worth the price and I will return the next time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "Giada's has one of the nicest views around. We went at lunch time and got a nice table next to the windows. I could see the Eiffel Towel at Paris and the fountains at The Bellagio. The interior is modern, with a warm, classy touch. It was clean and the staff was very helpful. The breakfast and lunch meals are all on the same menu.  For lunchtime it was pretty quiet. The only server I saw was Billy (fantastic server) and he moved quickly between tables. We started with a white sangria. I'm glad my wife and I split it. Not only was it delicious, it packed a little punch.   I had the Giada burger with an egg and bacon added. The onions overpowered the other flavors, I'll do the burger again without those. The provolone was flavorful and the beef blend was spot on. The burger, bacon, and egg were cooked perfectly. You could bite cleanly through them without pulling the toppings off of the burger.   My wife had the Arugula Salad with the shrimp. Be aware, if you add the shrimp ($11 upcharge) you get 2 shrimp. They are decent sized, but not worth $11.   I will be back, after having the good lunch experience, I'd like to try the dinner out. Give Giada's a try, I think you'll be happy you did.",

    "text": "Oh Giada... I love you.  This place has become one of my \"musts\" when visiting Las Vegas.   I made a reservation for one at 5:15pm on a Monday (before leaving for my flight home).  Sure, I definitely didn't NEED a reservation during this not-so-popular time, but I wanted to make sure I could get in.  Sure enough, no problem at all, and I was seated at 5:15.  I'll admit that I had a late lunch around 2pm and wasn't the MOST hungry, but I still wanted to order my favorites.    The Fresh Ricotta Crostini is so unique and delicious... I dream about these things.  Ricotta, honey, lemon & pink peppercorn... perfection.  I also have an inexplicable love for arugula, so I had to order the Arugula Salad.  Arugula, parmigiano-reggiano, candied lemon & pancetta... it's so fresh and light and delicious.  A little pricey at $16, but I really wanted that arugula.  Oh, and I almost forgot the complimentary bread platter!  The rosemary bread is perfection.  It's served with sea salt, an aioli, crushed red pepper, olive oil pesto & capers.  I love having the various \"dippers\"... every bite can be unique.  I also ordered a cocktail - the Amaretto di' Mulo (amaretto mule).  It's an interesting twist on the mule that features bourbon (Basil Hayden's bourbon), Disaronno amaretto & Fever Tree ginger beer.  Wow this thing was good.    I highly recommend visiting Giada if you're in town.  Service is great, food is delicious.",

They really have their staff trained to upsell you on everything!   Pretty much came here for what I thought was just going to be appetizers that turned into a $150 disappointment.   The best thing was the pesto with the bread, we asked for more to put on everything.   Pasta flight with chicken was horrible. It might have been 1 breast cut up if that. Chicken had a crust but was very dry. Spaghetti tasted like it was from a can, no flavor. The only one that was decent was a lemon flavor one.   Creamed brussel sprouts were very salty and it was a mush, I like whole or halved brussel sprouts so I know what I'm getting.   So yeah, pasta flight, wine flight, a beer, a side, espresso and lemon souffle that all sucked.   And they let some lady with her fake ass service dog sit at the bar!",

    "text": "We've been wanting to try Giada for awhile now. I love watching her cooking shows and have several of her cookbooks.  We decided to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary there. We got there early for a drink. We were pleasantly greeted by the bread prep person who asked us how our day was going as we headed to the bar. Super nice personal touch. The bartender was fabulous. Great personality and after asking us what types of flavors we like, he knew how to concoct a drink that we would enjoy. 5 stars for those 2 people. When our table was ready, we were seated at a lovely table by the window as we requested.   It was a good 5 minutes before anyone greeted us or dropped off menus or water or anything. No biggie. Just odd when it wasn't that busy and one would think their service would be great after our bar experience. Our server showed up with menus and introduced himself. A couple minutes later his helper showed up with water and introduced himself. Nice touch. Our server's personality was pretty flat, zero energy or enthusiasm for his job. Seemed like he was just punching in on a clock. Ok so ambiance 8, server attitude a 3. He made a couple of recommendations when we asked him. We took him up on his recommendations. We had the bruschetta and the Marsala meatballs. Both were good. Not great, but above average. We then ordered our entrees we had the petit filet and the pan seared halibut and the rigatoni dish to share. The filet was terrible. It had very little flavor, was dried out (medium rare) and was just bleh. I've made better at home. If you want an amazing steak...Stripsteak is the place to go. The halibut wasn't much better. It was the toughest fish I've tasted for halibut. Dried out and tough probably because it was over cooked. The sauce was flavorful. I was not a fan of the Swiss chard served with it. The pasta rigatoni was the best tasting out of all the dishes. It was flavorful and fresh. It was time for dessert. They have a dessert cart. I'm not sure what it was for because our waiter never offered to bring it by. It was kind of a tease because it rolled past us a few times, but our waiter just dropped off two small dessert menus. Then 5 mins later showed up and said \"which one do you want?\" We chose the limoncello souffle. It appeared our waiter wanted to turn the table when he said \"oh that one takes 12-13 minutes.\" Well ok. That's fine. Didn't ask if we wanted coffee or anything, just walked off. The souffle was ok. Was a little too undercooked/raw for me. It was just wet foam inside. All in all, we were greatly disappointed in this restaurant, the food wasn't good and the service was below average. With all the competition from other restaurants on or near the strip, the pricing and portion sizes I wouldn't recommend or revisit this restaurant. Looks good, but doesn't deliver the quality. 2 stars are for the pasta, location/ambiance and the bartender. Otherwise it would be 1 Star.",

My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar and as soon as we sat down I noticed every bit of detail from the napkins to the ice cold water waiting for you, very elegant and very Giada. I ordered a frose and so did pretty much every woman around me. They were so good it was dangerous. From there we ordered a pizza (pictured) and their sliders. Both were delicious.

If you are wondering if she is his daughter or his girlfriend, that's his girlfriend!   I finally made it here to have dinner to see what the hype is all about. I had been told by several friends that it was impossible to get a reservation, which I truly don't understand.  The view is nice but significantly lacking from the one at Paris or Cosmo, mostly due to the fact that the restaurant is on the 2nd level and not much higher. The Bellagio fountains are obstructed by the crosswalk bridge over Las Vegas Blvd, so not my much of a view. I probably saw more weirdos on the strip my whole meal more than anything else.  The service was ok but considering this is a fine dining establishment my drinks were not refilled during the meal & I actually had to ask a busboy to do it. I ordered an entree and an appetizer. The bacon wrapped dates were very good $16 for 5. However, my entree was terrible! Small plate of whatever it is that I had 3 bites of and left. Cost $28 and was a complete waste. The only thing that kept me from going home hungry was the complimentary bread with a variety of salts and butter.   Definitely would not come back.",

The syrup was light yet sweet. The flavors weren't super amazing, it's just breakfast done right with elegance. I didn't get hingry right away so the meal gave me long lasting energy. My husband had an American Breakfast. The toast comes with different toppings such as homemade jelly, nutella, lemon butter and salt and pepper.  The restaurant is so cute and resembles so much of Giada. It has a feel of home.  I am coming here again and again!",

Our waiter was really nice and helpful.  Everything seemed great, until after our entrees were dropped off.  I'm not sure if they were short staffed that day, but all of a sudden we couldn't find a waiter/waitress to help us fill our drink glasses nor ask us if we needed anything. After what felt like over 10 minutes, I finally was able to wave down our server.  He simply stopped and didn't apologize or even ask what was needed, he just stared.  Hmmm okay. well can you fill all our glasses???  Then it took me another 10 minutes to flag someone down for the check.  It's really sad we were so happy at the beginning, but they just couldn't keep it up.    I probably won't be going back, the food was just \"okay\".  One of our guest actually had to exchange her salad for another dish (soup) and she was still unimpressed.  Maybe dinner is their strong suit.  Who knows...",

If you are lucky, Giada herself will be  there and she is more than happy to say hello and check on you personally!  She told me a secret about the two of us (same birthdate) and we had a good laugh.  How personable is it?  The service staff while not perfect, was one of the nicest ones I've encountered.  You feel like you are not in a restaurant but an open room having dinner in someone's dining room off a kitchen.    Get the meatballs and the sandwiches are spectacular.  And obviously do not skip on dessert!  The restaurant is on the 2nd level of the Cromwell Hotel.  Don't miss the selfie picture booth while you wait for your table.    The first time we ate here we were seated along the window with a great view if the strip and Bellagio fountains.  My colleagues had pasta dishes and I had the prosciutto grilled cheese sandwich.    They messed up my colleagues dish ( forgot to add chicken) and then it took a while for it to come, but the hostess and waitress were extremely and sincerely apologetic.  They brought him a whole new dish although he ate half of the first dish.  My new favorite upscale casual dining experience on the Strip!",

The Filet was perfectly seared, Branzino pan fried crispy and stuffed with beautiful greens, while the Salmon with the Tangerine Vinegrette was light and cooked Medium rare.

They sat us in a private dining area which was just as beautifully decorated as the entire restaurant.     Started with a medium Salumi platter although the waiter said it feeds 3-4 people it actually is plenty for about 5-6 people.   Also had the calamari and shrimp and oysters for apps which we were also delicious.   Since we were a large party, we ordered different dishes and I was able to try several which were all fabulous.   Signature spaghetti was the top of the list, lobster ravioli, risotto, and branzino are my runner ups.  Ended the dinner with the chocolate molten cake.   Awesome dinner, fantastic service by Timothy our waiter, would love to go back and try the new additions to the spring menu.      There's even a photo booth to capture these memories.",

The music was a bit loud, but we were also there on a Friday night.  The table we got by the window was really nice since you could look out on the Vegas strip and see the Bellagio water fountain shows.    The food.  I mean, the food would be 2 stars for me.  It was just so mediocre and predictable.  It's never a nice meal when I know that I can make better food in my kitchen at home.  First, the lack of a price on the tasting menu is beyond annoying (FYI - it is $120 / person).  I hate that I had to ask.  Second, it's way overpriced.  I've eaten at e by Jose Andres, Joel Robuchon and L'Aterlier, Le Cirque, Guy Savoy, etc. (just for comparison in Vegas), and this was not worth it.  As such, we just ordered off the regular menu.  Other than the free bread that comes with the meal, which was outstanding, the food was disappointing.    Pecorino Tartufo with apricot preserves  - meh.  Needs a vessel to be served on.  Only came with the cheese.  This was a server recommendation.  Blah. Roman Caprese and Baby Kale Salad - both excellent.   Spaghetti - shrimp was excellent, but the spaghetti was underwhelming.  It was under-sauced, and the sauce was more like an Alfredo if it was weak and bland.  This was a server recommendation.  Meh. Whole Roasted Chicken - well cooked, salty.  Overall, it was meh.  I can make it better at home.  The cacciatore was super sweet and underwhelming.  I can do better by making my own sauce in a pressure cooker that has way more depth of flavor.    All in all, we would not go back.  You can easily identify how the recipes come together, and where they fall apart.  When my party and I spent the majority of the meal discussing how we could have improved the dish, it isn't a dish worth paying for.",

I've always loved an open kitchen where you can see the chefs preparing food so you get an idea of what to expect ahead of time, and the room itself was spacious and beautifully decorated. Our table had a great view overlooking the city though I was seated too close to another gal who kept bumping into me. The service was exceptional and whenever our waiter was at the table he always seemed to be smiling and engaging. Very friendly! As for the food, it was on the more expensive side, but very tasty. The serving sizes were big enough to share so we tried a few different dishes which is always the way to go in my opinion. Honestly, the pizza was probably one of my favorites. All of the food was good but you can't go wrong with a home made pizza with a hint of a smokey flavor from the oven. Next time I will have to try the desserts!",

One thing that irks me about these high end restaurants is no salt and pepper on the tables. How does the chef know what everyone's palate is like? I don't get it.

    "text": "I wanted my first 2015 review to start off on the right foot and that's why I've been saving this one!   We actually went last month for dinner. Definitely be sure to make a reservation way in advance if you're wanting anything between 6pm-8pm. And when I say in advance I mean months in advance. We booked about a month out and the only option we had was either 5pm or 9pm.   Yes the service is slow. Our entire dining experience was 2 hours total. But that's what exactly this is, an experience. If you're looking for a quick in and out, this is not the place you want to be.  Yes the portions do look small. However looks are very deceiving. Once you start eating, it is very hearty! In fact we had a difficult time finishing everything. And trust me, you want to finish everything because it's so good!  Now onto the food:  -COMPLIMENTARY CARBS: I have to say, these were so delicious! I could sit there and eat that all day. In fact we even asked to take it to go! Haha. There were 3 different types of bread that came with 3 different types of sides to put on. This here will definitely fill you up to try to control yourself!  -LOBSTER ARANCINI: This was ok. Definitely tasted more of the breading than the actual lobster itself. Wouldn't recommend this.  -PIZZETTE MORTADELLA: It was our fault for ordering this thinking the portions were small and that we weren't going to be full. This is a mini pizza but definitely skip this and save room for the main course. It was nothing special. Felt like lunch meat on puffed up pizza crust.  -SPAGHETTI: Definitely get this! This was amazing. The size of the shrimp was literally the size of my hand. And it was cooked to perfection. Love the pasta since it was freshly made. Again the portion may look small when it's first brought out but I had to have my husband help me finish it.  -SALMON: Definitely get this as well! Again cooked to perfection. The quality is that of sashimi.   -ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: Various color of cauliflower, roasted just right.   -GIADA SIGNATURE DRINK: They are definitely not stingy with the alcohol put into this. A beautiful drink. But not for me.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Get only one antipasti. A main dish per person. And I promise you your taste buds will thank you.",

His suggestions were amazing, he was never trying to upswell and you could tell he cared about you and your evening so much.  I mean he started with are you celebrating anything this evening?! He actually cared about how our time was and that everything was palatable and enjoyable.   I started with the best aperol spritz I have had so Light and fresh with the perfect notes of orange and just enough bubbles. Then the bread selection was RIGHT UP MY ALLEY, with 6 different things to get your taste buds going.   The branzino was flavorful, and the kale salad to start was just the right amount of sweet tender and salty. I ate it in minutes.  Overall, we have a very enjoyable experience and a GREAT view of the strip. It's a beautiful clean restaurant and I so glad ROCCO could be at our service, the pleasure was all ours.",

First of all, I wasn't offered that option when I made the reservation. Secondly, we would have easily spent that amount. Lastly, how arrogant! I own a restaurant and this seems like bad policy. Don't let them hold your wallet hostage.",

You walk in to the smell of the wood burning ovens. The tables at the window give an indoor/outdoor feel, which was great. Wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. The staff was generally attentive although it added to our weekend's experience that service in Vegas doesn't live up to expectations. Our server was \"trying\" too hard, which made for some awkward moments at the table. But back to the food...the lobster roll with fried capers was awesome although the value was a bit off (not sure it was nearly $40 good!). The carbonara pizza was unbelievable-clear highlight of the meal. Or was the Barbarella cocktail the winner? I'd go back for both!",

No explanations and never saw the waitress Stephanie for over 30 minutes.  Finally, received an insincere apology from the waitress after asking for the assistant manager, Greisy, who also did not show any genuine concern that they set us back 2 hours waiting for some scrambled eggs and a waffle.  The treatment from the staff was simply rude and dismissive.  When the food finally arrived, it appeared thrown together, there was another delay in getting salt and pepper (?), and the meal was mediocre at best.  Dined at numerous high end restaurants on the Strip and this is hands down the most unprofessional and unpleasant dining experience of the bunch.  Skip this place, plenty of other great options to enjoy weekend brunch.  Zero stars.",

Sat at the bar since I was just dining by myself, hostesses were nice and welcoming, even offered me a small tour of the restaurant. Eric, the bartender who took care of me, owned the bar! He was making great suggestions to all of his customers. I started with a cocktail, the Destroyer it was so good but 18 dollars refrained me for getting a second one. For my meal I decided to make two antipasti and a pasta dish. Great choice! I started out with the Vitello Tonato crustini antipasto, it was a fancier version from the rustic original Italian version, but all the flavored were there! Delizioso! Second came the Bacon Wrapped Dates, good but I was still overwhelmed by the crustini I had before. Eric offered me a small splash of Nero D'Avola to pair my dates and enjoy them better, it made a huge difference. Before my entree I had the Oro di Milano beer, nice and full bodied beer, around 8,5 abv. Finally the dish that blew my mind came, the Lobster Ravioli!! Wow, I was speechless when I took the first bite. Everything in that plate balanced perfectly, I could go back tomorrow and eat the same thing again!!  Overall, great experience! Would definitely recommend and come back for more!!",

I ordered the romaine salad with fried capers and vinigrette Caesar. It was dressed well not saturated I liked the flavor. Missed the fried capers, too few to be memorable. The two croutons sucked and may as well been left off.  The bucatini was alright. Again I liked it but not for the price.  The al dente stuck to my teeth and not in a good way. Lacked sauce!!!     The ricotta was a teaspoon Seriously!!  Husband had the lobster ravioli and liked it.   The service was great!   So, if you like small portions(trust me, you won't need a doggy bag here) and care less if there's  any yummy sauce to mop up.  Bread was more like a soggy garlic ball and not crusty, too much Rosemary . Then there you go, it's pricey, it's in the strip and we've been there and won't likely return.",

Hands down BEST meal of our vacation!  Stephanie was our server and she gave amazing service! She was joyful, welcoming and most importantly, she knew the menu very well, as our group had questions and dietary needs. We each ordered a cocktail and lunch entree and then shared 2 desserts. Everthing was \"lick my plate\" wonderful! Next Vegas trip we all agreed a must repeat. BTW all 4 of us are Italian and love how Giada captures Italian flavors in Las Vegas.",

We sent the hyped up $60 chicken entree back because it was over cooked, dry as a bone, and no flavor. KFC OR Popeyes would have been way better.  They suggested the tomahawk pork as a replacement. It was thin, fatty and tough. They paired it with lobster ravioli that was undercooked.  We had come expecting and looking forward to greatness instead we left our special anniversary dinner $250 lighter in the wallet and feeling ripped off.  The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is that our server Tim was professional and apologetic about the kitchen's failures.  I honestly think Giada and Gordon Ramsey should become friends. And we absolutely love Giada. She's always been my favorite celebrity chef.  But can't help but feel she would be embarrassed if she had been there tonight.",

    "text": "My husband and I enjoyed lunch at Giada on Saturday during our stay at The Cromwell. We would have preferred to eat dinner there, but lunch was our only option because we decided to go to Vegas as a last minute getaway. Even with a lunch reservation, we had to wait over 20 minutes for a table.   Service was good, but there is room for improvement. Delicious bread was brought to our table, but we had to wait five minutes for bread plates. We witnessed this same thing happen to another table, but they had ordered several pizzas to share and had to sit there staring at the pizzas until someone brought them plates over five minutes later. This should be an easy fix for Giada. Also, my husband ordered sparkling water and was not given a different glass, so when a different server automatically refilled his water glass with flat water, our server scolded the water person. It was a little awkward, and to fix this, they need to bring a different glass if someone orders sparkling water.   The restaurant is open and lovely. You notice instantly that they have put great thought into the details of the restaurant. Unfortunately, out table was right next to the server station, so nearly each time a server left this area, I would get bumped in my seat. With so much thought put into every aspect of the restaurant, I am surprised that they have squeezed a table into this area. Hopefully, they will remove this table so diners can enjoy a relaxing dining experience without the irritation of having servers brush up against you or knock into your chair.   The lunch menu seemed quite limited, offering only one pasta dish, and no meatless pasta option. I really wanted to order pasta, but since this was not an option, we ordered the olives, burrata, the kale mushroom and gorgonzola pizza, the romaine salad, and the lobster roll. Everything was fabulous, but it all had a lot of olive oil.   The specialty coffee drinks and desserts sounded amazing, but we were pretty full and the restaurant had gotten pretty hot in the direct sunlight, so we decided against it.   Next time we are in Vegas, I will make reservations for dinner far in advance, so we can try a pasta dish and definitely enjoy dessert and coffee. I do not think we would go back for lunch, but I look forward to trying dinner at Giada.",

When it did arrive, the waiter did not explain anything about the selection of items on the bread board. We were not told of any chef's specials, if there were any. We wanted the butternut squash soup. They were out of it. The oysters rockefeller were extraordinary! Unfortunately, that was the only great thing about  our meal. The veal saltimbucca was just barely lukewarm, so the cheese was not ooey gooey, as it should have been, and it was dry. It had way too much breading on it for my taste, and I did not care for the red sauce that came with it, on the side. I've had much better saltimbucca at Bootleggar, and it didn't cost $57, either. The service was so-so. They did not keep our water glasses filled. This place is very over priced and underwhelming. I would not go back. The first time we dined here was just after it opened, and it was wonderful! The service and the food were superb. That was, sadly, not the case this time around. I also remember them asking us to rate and review them after dinner, on our last visit. They did not do that this time. I also remember the manager coming around to the tables to greet everyone and check on them, on our last visit. That also did not happen this time around. When you factor in the $14 we had to pay for parking, even as locals, it was a truly disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Went to Giads's last night. Absolutely phenomenal. Did the tastings menu at our servers suggestion and was not disappointed.   The two of us had the tasting menu. The breads and antipasti were very good. I really enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates. The lemon spaghetti and shrimp were out of this world ( remember this is not ronzoni pasta folks, it's fresh made and served al dente). For our proteins we had the rack of lamb ( 4 pieces and you could cut it with your fork) and the tenderloin. Both had a perfect medium rare cook. The garnishes were all tasty as well, but honestly we just tried them as we were getting full ( I may or may not have polished off the basil mashed potatoes). Then the desert cart comes out. Again, we were getting full, but we tried the 8 layer chocolate cake and one other. Awesome!  Our servers, Andrew and Michael were on point all night. Anticipated our needs, made suggestions and delivered the goods! True professionals!  I laugh when I read some of the reviews as they complain about the portion sizes. I'm 6'1\", 230 lbs and I was full. I wasn't stuffed to the point where I had to undo my belt like on thanksgiving, but I was full.  Vegas has plenty of all you can eat buffets. This is not one of them. If you want quality and a unique dining experience I suggest you give this place a try!!  Thank you Giada!",

The service and ambiance of the restaurant were without a doubt a 5 out of 5, it's by far the most elegant restaurant I have ever been to. The server was really attentive and helpful; recommending drinks and constantly asking if we needed anything. We decided to do the tasting menu, it had no prices on the menu which was disappointing, we knew it was going to be really expensive but we decided to roll with it anyways. Overall we liked the food, but we felt like every dish was very rich, the meal could've been better balanced. We both had the steak, which was over-seasoned, I'm tough steak critic though. The highlights of the meal were definitely the lemon spaghetti appetizer and the dessert cart! The Lemon ricotta cookies live up to the hype, they're to die for. I really enjoyed my experience, and I would go back, just wouldn't do the menu tasting experience, but I'm glad I tried it once.",

    "text": "Avoid avoid avoid! There are much better places to try and this is just a celebrity chef trying to capitalize on her family name.  Go to Bobby's restaurant across the street. Its WAY BETTER.   First of all my husband and I are really Giada fans and have been watching her show since it started so long ago and have cooked alot of her recipes so we were super excited to come here. We dressed up well and were excited.  From the moment we came in it was just weird.   1) The staff that welcomes you first said HI and that you are early, which is fine so we start waiting, but while we were waiting the hostesses kept looking over at us and chitter chattering.  It was kinda uncomfortable. I made eye contact with them multiple times and it was ODD. 2) Giada's restaurant is known for its location and main dining area with windows all around it to view the strip.  We got taken to a table in the dark corner at a L-shaped dining arranged across from the bar where ppl's backs were facing us.  We asked if there was another table and they showed us another dark corner of the restaurant where only 2 ppl were sitting and the table was next to the escalator.  Then they told us to wait 30 minutes for another table.  So we decided we did not come all this way to Las Vegas to sit in some dark corners so we said we would wait.  We go back out and then suddenly and magically another hostess says there is another table ready and we get taken to the main dining floor.  I mean com'on MAGICALLY there is table.  Ridiculous.  We were dressed up so I do not understand the run around.   The ppl next to us were wearing shorts. I have no freaking clue, but I was pissed by the time we sat down because we were bypassed for this table which was clearly open in the main area.  3)  Our server showed the tasting menu to another table, but not us.  My parents actually went to Giada's a few months prior and told us they did the tasting menu.  What the heck. I'm not doing your job for you.  4) We ordered.  And here are the bland dishes.... A) charred octopus - tasteless.  the fennel added nothing, there was one kumquat slice on it, it was not seasoned, no citrus, just bland well cooked octopus.  B) orzo meatballs - it does not tell you what kind of meat is in it in the menu which would be helpful. The orzo is just mush in the meatball.  There is no texture and its just a basic meatball.  C) Bucatini - the calabrian chili pomodoro is not spicy. Calabrian chilis are supposed to be medium spicy at the least and it was a basic good red sauce with well cooked bucatini I could do at home. D) Tortellini- pea, pancetta - OK, nothing special. For some reason it was a really sour sauce and my tortellini were not fully cooked.  I did not taste the peas and the pancetta was burned so that made it taste weird too. The saltiness from the pancetta was well past in the cooking. When I told the waiter at the end when he asked me how dinner was that the tortellini were a bit raw he said it's al dente. OK I\"M NOT STUPID. I know what al dente is. I've been watching Giada and other chefs for a long time.  But if I'm chewing alot to eat the food, which I told him, it's not al dente.   E) Giada cocktail - this is the reason why i gave it ONE STAR, because the drink was actually well made and tasty.  Kudos to bartender who was the only person doing good work.   Needless to saw we did not do dessert in this wretched place and got the hell out of here fast.  We did not take the usual pictures of our food that we do bc we were mad.   The server decided to ask us how the food was at the end otherwise we never saw him.  The water guy was excellent and kept us filled up.    What a waste. We were really disappointed. We are big Giada fans and watch all her shows and have seen all her cookbooks and have cooked alot of her recipes, but after this experience I'm just turned off and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  You can do better at Bobby's Mesa Grill across the street. I gave that 4 stars and would go there again.",

My risotto with crab and scallops was divine, I just wish there was more. The banana gelato wasn't really gelato, but it was a very good ice cream. I loved the Chocolate Amaretti cake!   All in all, we would go back if we are in Vegas again, but I do recommend they reconsider portion sizes. Far too small for the prices we're shelling out, even for Vegas standards.",

The tomatoes were sliced almost transparent and were over ripe. The waiter tried to tell me it's because they are heirloom tomatoes. I told him we didn't like it. He took it back and never asked if we wanted it replaced. He just brought us another one that was no better. He then brought the Caponata. It tasted pre made and reheated. Not fresh. Our entree was rigatoni. It also was not fresh made. We both commented at the same time it tasted like out of a can or something.  If this restaurant was not on the strip it would never survive. There are many better Italian restraints in Vegas.  Locals beware. It's not worth it.  High priced and does not live up to the hype.  If you read other low reviews you will see the same comments. Maggiano's is right down the street. It's a chain but still better.",

    "text": "Giada's that pretty lady from the Food Network that's always cooking something while gracing us with that candid smile of hers and to be honest I probably have the biggest woman crush on her. Evarr.  FOOD: Came for breakfast had the American Breakfast that came with smashed lemon potatoes, two eggs (style of your choice, toast, and sausage meatballs or bacon). Let me just say this first, ALWAYS get the Orzo Sausage Meatballs as the side. SO GOOD. Delicious aromatic marinara sauce were drizzled atop these delicate balls of awesomeness, no joke was like ambrosia (especially after the disaster of all meatball situations at Andiamo the night prior). The smashed lemon potatoes were also amazing as well, gently cooked on a skillet these potatoes are then dressed with a beautifully made sauce consisting of lemon juice, thyme, and parsley topped with a light sprinkle of lemon zest. You can taste every bit of the ingredients used. The microgreen tomato salad was surprisingly delicious and refreshing, I was originally hesitant since I'm not a huge fan of sprouts.  SERVICE: On the higher end of the spectrum in terms of restaurant so general rule of thumb you would expect good service and the wait staff here proved that to be True. Very attentive and made sure every table got their order and that the food was the way we liked it.  ATMOSPHERE: The venue is gorgeous, everything here is so pretty and well thought out. An architectural and interior representation to Giada herself. Light colored wood with white painted walls, occasional splashes of gold. It was very inviting, the seats/booths were all super comfortable. The way the restaurant was built allows sunlight through so the entire place is awash in bright refreshing light. The entire place makes you feel good eating here.  SO. IN. LOVE. With this place........ :)",

I feel like because Giada is a chef on the food network they feel they can overcharge for food and people will pay. The waiter was extremely attentive as were the rest of the general staff.

THE MENU (LUNCH): - I like how it indicates which items are Giada Classics and which are Gluten Free - to be perfectly honest, the names of the menu items were SO Italian for us (not what we're used to and not bad because it's authentic considering Giada IS an Italian FROM Italy) that we had to Google the meaning of them - antipasti (vegetable, meat, cheese, salumi, pizza) - soup - salad - sandwiches - pasta - signature cocktails  WHAT WE ORDERED: - orzo meatballs - arugula with chicken milanese - sausage & eggplant lasagna - sweet pea tortellini - orecchiette al pomodoro  THE PORTION SIZES/TASTE: - majority of our group are former fraternity boys so when our food came out one of them said, \"we're going to get burgers after this right?\" - the portions are VERY small; enough (or barely enough, or not even close depending on your appetite) to feed one person; the salad was a lot bigger than the actual pasta dishes - the taste of EVERYTHING was AMAZING though  CUSTOMER SERVICE: - warm - welcoming - made you feel at home (at an expensive home straight out of a magazine or the newly renovated ones you see on HGTV) - very knowledgeable",

I must have called 20 times and I always ask for the hostess or manager and they send me to the reservations hotline......Giada get a phone that works in your restaurant. So the last time we were there for some reason they ran out of lobster rolls by 1pm.....Waiter said sorry but you can order something else. We are locals and love the food and the location. At the end of our meal the waiter also told us that they do not honor local discounts any more......Again I love this place but you really need to work on the little things like staff and stocking your food.....I guess these would be considered big things. Im sure I will give it a try again at some point.",

We elected not to do the Giada tasting menu for a couple of reasons. One, I had my eyes set on the veal chop. And two, I felt the selection would have taken the experience from a culinary sampling and turned it into a tourist experience. They included an autographed picture of Giada and some recipes.  And that option would be fine if I wasn't so interested in making my own selections.  We started with a bottle of champagne and a antipasti sampler platter and it was delicious. Bacon wrapped dates, cream stuffed peppers, crostini, and filet on toast with a pesto sauce. Wow. Our entrees were very large portions. I ordered the veal chop saltambucca Milanese style. I could rank that dish alone in my top five of all time. Splendid sauce and a perfect cook to a delicate piece of veal. Our dessert was some chocolate tower which I wish we had more of and a lemon hazelnut torte. Perfect way to end the night was with a drink recommended by the waiter. A spicy liquor with a double shot of cappuccino over ice. It was divine!",

    "text": "Eh. Went in mid july for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. Tried to book reservations 2 weeks before we got to Vegas, but they were all booked. (this was before Giada was open for lunch). My hubby and I were waking past the Cromwell (please see separate review) and we wandered upstairs to get a look at Giada's. We were able to make a reservation a week in advance for dinner at 9:30pm on a Monday. Upon making the reservation, the hostess asks if we will be celebrating anything special. I tell her its our anniversary. (thinking maybe Giada will come say hi?!). They were very vocal in telling us about the dress code. However, as we arrived in our Sunday best. people strolled in wearing sneakers, shorts, and maxi dresses from the pool...The night of our reservation, we arrive a few minutes early. There is a free Photo Booth there that was a fun and free souvenir. The open concept kitchen as you walk into the dining room is gorgeous. Fresh antipasti station, Fresh pasta being handmade, bread being baked... The room itself is beautiful. Very white, very chi chi. Very Manhattan pretentious. When you are first seated, the waiter brings you a menu with \"Giada's selections\". This menu is several courses meant to work together that Giada arranged to compliment eachother. This was $120 pp. We weren't interested in eating all that. The waiter brought over an iPad to take drink and antipast orders. I didn't want to drink and the (3) choices of antipast did not impress me. I was praying the whole menu wasn't on an iPad because this layout was so annoying to use. Finally the waiter comes back with a real menu. I am a major foodie (please see ALL my reviews), and it took me forever to find something I was interested in eating. This rarely (if ever) happens to me. Giada raved and raved about having \"gluten free food\", so we expected to see GF pasta. NOPE. Her GF foods were meat and veggies, which by the grace of God, are GF already. That was a disappointment. Again, it  took forever to figure out what to order. GIada's Italian food is not your \"traditional\" Italian food. (ex spaghetti and meatballs, manicotti, braciole, red sauce, etc). For traditional, amazing,  Italian food, please see my review for Buddy V's. Her food is more Mediterranean Italian- lots of lemon, fennel- very different recipes and combinations of food. I felt lost and unfamiliar with the menu. We wound up ordering chicken marsala meatballs, shrimp scampi with marscapone cheese, and we each had a salad. The meatballs were excellent. Shrimp scampi was very different. Not at all garlicky, which is often synonymous with scampi. Salads were good. They bring out a big selection of bread to the table, with pesto dip and several other dips, and that was good. The only thing I entertained getting as an entree was the rack of lamb, but it was $45, and something I make at home. I wanted something different. For dessert they bring over an entire cart of desserts- from homemade gelato, to cookies, to pastries... we had cappuccinos and tiramasu. I had traditional Tiramasu and my husband had Peanut butter & Jelly tiramasu. Those were amazing. It was extra cool that GIada was there that night cooking, and coming out to tables in the dining room to talk with patrons. They seemed to send her out to select tables, aka high rollers, as she didn't go around the room to all. That wasn't cool. It was very cool to see her in person, as I am a big fan of her shows, but being the anniversary and all, she could have stopped by. I wonder why they even asked that...We felt it was a little too much for us. We are laid back people that enjoy casual places. Not enough offerings on the menu for our palette. We go to Vegas every year, and I don't think we would go back. For 2 people for 2 appertizers, 2 salads and 2 desserts with cappuccino, it was over $100. Portions are SMALL.",

I walked out after dinner feeling violated financially, in other words, ripped off.  $9 for a small bottle of sparking water.  Come on.  The food was good but the small portions and high prices makes me a one time customer.  The waiter was pushing the fixed price dinner at $120 per person.  (The whole table has to order it.)  When we didn't go for it, the service dropped off noticeably.  I got suckered in.",

The hostess couldn't find our reservations initially because they were spending more time chatting than listening to the party name and count, part of our party was joining us later and we'd asked to be seated anyway which they ignored entirely instead letting us sit in the bar with a waitress obviously hired more for looks than ability. Unable to get water, drinks, or appetizers from her she instead threw attitude when  we got them directly from the bar (who I'll admit every one of the counter staff were amazing). Finally being seated at the empty table I'd been staring at for nearly an hour, a quarter of the menu is unavailable not because they ran out but rather because they put the wrong menu in and the kitchen was unwilling to cook that menu. Being pushed heavily toward the rather unimpressive special we instead had appetizers, some salumi, and oysters, a few drinks and our dinner was instead a light snack. Next time save half the price and get twice the meal, go to Joe's.",

We would order that again if we were to go back to Giada's. I had the lemon spaghetti with prawns and my husband had the lobster ravioli. Both were just okay. For the price we paid, we thought the dish would be more spectacular. The lemon spaghetti wasn't anything special and the portions were a little smaller side. The prawns were huge and I guess that's what we paid for. My husband said the ravioli was really buttery and all you can taste was that. The lobster meat lack the natural sweet seafood taste. Unfortunately the buttery after taste was too overpowering. Then we moved onto the dessert menu and nothing really stuck out. I can't remember what it was called but it was some sort of chocolate molten cake. It was a little spongey and dry. We also ordered a cappugiro and that was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, the ambience was nice our server was polite and friendly. However, the food was just nothing special. Our bill came out to be $160 and we walked away not completely satisfied.",

The food lacks flavor, and tries to be original, but fails. We spent over $100 on appetizers alone. All of which were bland, simply, boring, and completely lackluster.  My husband spent $70 on a bone in steak that was over cooked and each bite took him five minutes to chew. I was going over the Heimlich maneuver in my head because I was convinced he was going to choke at every swallow.  After eating there I read the New York Times review, and it was totally right on. This place screamed Giada and every glance, but made her look like someone who is completely over her head when it comes to the restaurant industry. She needs to stick to what she knows and leave the business of serving food to the masses to the professionals. Clearly she isn't one.",

    "text": "First of all, I don't watch the food network, so I had no idea who Giada is. There are so many great places to eat here in Vegas. When this opened, we thought we'd try it. My wife knew of her and she was supposed to be a great chef. We've been there almost a dozen times since it's opening. I've read some of the the other reviews, and I was so surprised. We go to Europe once a year. Spent the whole month of August bouncing around Italy and other places. Eating at Giada was like eating in Italy. It was that good! We see her there all the time. She's making sure everyone is having a great meal and a great overall experience. She's a cute tiny little thing. Came over to our table and sat down for a picture. Again, I didn't freak out as I didn't know who she was. But she was very sweet. We've had most of the menu. Small but filling portions. If you're used to big servings, this isn't the place. You order a few smaller tasters. Each of them are filling enough without gorging yourself.  That's how to get the most out of the experience. The wait staff is exceptionally attentive, and they always made us feel like Rock Stars. They take their time with you. Allowing you to enjoy each plate throughout your meal. Like they do in Italy. If you're rushed, this isn't the place for you and you'll miss out. The atmosphere, view, presentation, and the food itself, are so worth the price, that again, I'm surprised at some of the reviews. This place is our single favorite place to eat in Vegas and I've been here since 1994. We're going back again next week. Oh, no matter what you do, no matter how much you eat, save room for the lemon ricotta cookies for desert. For all I know, she puts crack in them! They are that good!",

The staff is welcoming, the place is spacious yet warm, and the service is efficient yet  unpretentious. You can really see that she paid attention to every detail, down to the shapes of the bar ware. And the FOOD - OUTSTANDING! The four of us ordered one of their mixed mushroom pizzette, their medium assorted antipasto platter, the lobster arancini, and the braciole, and then we each ordered a different pasta. I had the vegetable Bolognese rigatoni, the others ordered the lobster ravioli, signature lemon spaghetti with shrimp and the scallop and asparagus risotto. Every dish was so delicious that we made a reservation for the next night before we even got through dinner. Which brings us to the dessert cart. And another OMG. The dessert portions are small, which allows you to sample several of them. We tried the white coffee gelato, the mascarpone cheesecake and the chocolate amaretti bars.  In fact, the portion sizes in general are reasonable rather than overkill, so you don't leave feeling overstuffed or like you wasted half of your meal by leaving it behind.  In summary, if you can get a reservation, run, do. Run, do not walk,  to Giada for one of the best meals you will ever eat.",

Not terribly disappointing since we were really there for the food, not the views.  I was looking forward to the grilled cheese and disappointed when they informed me they were out.  Long story short, our experience consisted of a lot of waiting...waiting for our table, waiting for our order to be taken, waiting for our drinks, and waiting for our food.  My husband was served his food at least 20 minutes before me.  He politely tried to wait for me as long as he could and ate slow, but his food ended up cold.  The food in general was okay and a little bland.  I would expect more considering the prices.  They were kind enough to discount my meal for the wait, but it will be long before we ever return. I hope I'm not discounting them on a bad day since I heard the table next to us call someone over for water and menus after they had been sitting at their table for 10 minutes without anyone going over.     Drinks were excellent and bar service was great while we waited for our table, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.",

    "text": "Over the Thanksgiving weekend, the mad Russian and I went to visit my sister in Las Vegas and had to try to the new restaurant in town. We had a little time to kill so we went down to the casino and won some money, so the night was starting in the right direction. We were seated promptly and had a choice table by the windows. Our waiter, Joseph came straight away and offered us a specialty cocktail menu from which we decided on 3 Blue Velvets. Beautiful to look at and somewhat sweet for my tastebuds but good none the less. The decor is very nice and the restaurant is not loud at all. The waitstaff was very attentive and had all the plates cleared and kept the water glasses full. We ordered a shrimp pizza, veal chop, bucatini and a side of mushrooms. All were presented beautifully and came out hot. I'd offer another half to one star, but after dessert and coffee, our bill came and we were charged for food we ordered and wanted but did not get to try since it hadnt been delivered.  Upon pointing out the mistake, our waiter corrected our bill very courteously and apologized for the oversight. Overall, we had a great meal and would come back on a future visit.",

It was a bit over priced but had a nice selection of cheeses and meats with some tasty sage honey and Dijon mustard.  We waiting to order our entrees a bit to try to enjoy our lunch but the waitress too a very long time to return after our meat and cheese try was done.   My husbands sandwich had a large piece of twine in it.  He was about half way done when he bit into it.  Our waitress never returned to our table to check on us, so everyone else finished before she returned to tell her about the twine.  They took the sandwich off...BUT if your total bill is over 250 for 4 people at lunch.... Maybe a dessert or something on the house as he didn't get to finish his meal.    Pro:  Most of the food was tasty.  Best entree was lemon pesto grilled cheese.  It had big bright flavors.  The zucchini scalapi is amazing!   It's long zucchini strings... So good!   So many amazing choices in Vegas so will not choose to return here anytime soon.",

    "text": "We went here with another couple who own several Italian restaurants in another city to sample the food and, in their case, to pick up some ideas. However, we all had a poor experience beginning with our pushy waiter who seemed focused on turning over the table as soon as possible. The menu was surprisingly limited and pricey. One of the entrees that was ordered was the veal chop saltimbocca. We've all had many saltimbocca style dishes and this was clearly not saltimbocca style. It looked and tasted like a breaded pork chop with lots of fat hidden in the breading and without the sauce that typically comes with a saltimbocca dish. A side dish of polenta was ordered as well which was not the solid form of polenta that we were used to but, instead, resembled a dish of grits. With the exception of the brussel sprouts, the other items were just as disappointing. Another item of note is that, although their wine list is extensive, the prices were three to four times market prices as opposed the two times market price that we typically encounter.   We went to another Las Vegas Italian restaurant, Canaletto, the following day and had a great experience which helped erase the memories here.",

I told you, make our experience for us! You did that plus more.  You chose every course for us! Meat and cheese platter, pasta and shrimp, tomahawk, Brussel sprouts  (no dessert because we didn't have room). Lindsay all I can say to you, one server to another is you are one amazing server! You took what I asked of you and you gave us such an amazing experience. Not only was the food AMAZING but your personality was so on point! You treated us like a guest in your home and really that's what we are about! I felt comfortable and appreciated. I felt like you wanted me to have a good time! Management....Lindsay needs to get a pat on the back! She is the epitamay of great service! She is the reason I will always come back everytime I'm in Vegas (btw I live in Los Angeles so I'm not far). Lindsay as I told you, please come visit me at my restaurant when you are in LA. To the chef.....excellent dishes! Food runner was informative too....he explained every dish with confidence and class! George is the manager I just spoke with as I praised Lindsay and he also had such a great personality via phone. He genuinely cared about my comments I had about Lindsay and my experience at his restaurant.  Thank you FOH and BOH for everything! Lindsay girl! You are the real MVP though!!!",

    "text": "Went for an early lunch today. Lasagna $24: came with a petite side of arugula salad. Lasagna flavor was ok and a bit on the salty side. The pasta had a non existent texture. It was soft and mushy. Tasted like cafeteria food.  Orzo meatball $14: flavor was so so but the texture of the meatball was like blended tofu. It was soft and mushy and the meatball didn't retain its shape after scooping it up into my plate. It just fell apart. It's hard to tell from the photo but the meatballs are bite sized (tapas portions). Each one was like a small cherry tomato. Tricolor salad $16:  over dressed. The veggies were soggie.  Extremely salty.  I couldn't make out the veggies because it has so much salad dressing.  Free pizza bread: fantastic! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The pesto olive oil was delicious. Service: slow. We sat down and waiting 15 minutes before getting water or a menu.  It was 10:45am and there were 5 other tables. Our waitress said she was in the back and didn't know we were seated there.  My friend and I were highly disappointed in our meal.  The food didn't taste good. Everything had the same texture (soft and mushy), small portions for the price you pay, leans towards the salty side, and one dimensional.  I would not recommend this place.  Sorry :(",

The shrimp was over cooked  the noodles were dry no sauce what so ever the asparagus was under cooked the short ribs was just ok..... I should have complained because it was not busy at all.

Coming up the escalator into the restaurant and you already knew it was going to be an upscale restaurant. Since we made reservations, we had no wait. But, there's a photo booth on the left side of the entrance that's free that you can take advantage of if there's a long wait!  We walked in and we were seated right away. The waiter and waitresses were really nice and the manager of the restaurant even came to say hello and check up on our party of 8.   The ambiance of the place was lounge like with romantic lighting. When you walk into the restaurant, you can see some of the cooking. Even the bathrooms were nice as the napkins to wipe your hands had the G logo on them. Oh, Giada.  I got the Spaghetti with the shrimp, lemon & basil for $34. Never have I ever expected to pay so much for spaghetti. When I first got the entree I thought it was sooo small. But it was actually veryyy filling! It came with three shrimps and they were HUGE, fresh and delicious.   All in all, great food and a classy experience. Definitely on the pricey side but if you're really to drop $50+ per person (just for an entree), this is a place to wine and dine in Vegas.",

My husband and I came to Vegas for our 4 year anniversary, to relax at the pool and eat at some AMAZING restaurants. Unfortunately Giada's was NOT amazing!!! We felt like we were not treated with the great customer service that I would expect. Our server was very inattentive, he missed an opportunity with us, we were planing on spending a lot on our meal and ended up only ordering 1 glass of wine and mediocre meals, then closing out our bill, with out dessert or more drinks simply because we desperately wanted out of the restaurant. My kale salad was drenched in a heavy cream dressing, So much so that you could not taste and other elements of the salad (I complained and they did kindly take it off our bill). I ordered the lemon spaghetti, and it was just ok, for 35 dollars I would have expected more.   Seems like they are just looking to make money here, and do not truly care about your experience. With so many options in Las Vegas for fine dining I would skip this one. My favorite local Italian restaurant in Denver far exceeds what I experienced here at Giada's...... What a disappointment.",

From the bread plate with its fresh made rosemary muffin, to the scallop and crab risotto, to the mind-blowing lemon smashed potatoes, to the filet Mignon, there was not a  wrong note the whole evening. Which itself is amazing for new restaurant.  We ordered the much-applauded bacon wrapped dates, but the merguez sausage was really spicy that night. Our server took it ff our bill and was happy to bring anything else instead.  Our table was in the center window and had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.

There was much sweetness to the pizza, and we thought it might be good for a shared appetizer but not a main cold dish.  My wife enjoyed the Muffuletta with the fried string zucchini. A bit bready but tasty.  The Super Tuscan at $17 per glass was very good. Probably not worth $17.  I would not return for lunch but I would try the dinner menu.  The music in the restaurant was loud and 2010. Very strange.  F",

Wall decorations include many Giada family photos, posters from her grandfather's movie career as well as Giada retail items which were in abundance. The hostess stand was staffed by several people waiting to escort you to your table. Upon entering the restaurant dining room the hostess offers a tour of the open kitchen and describing the items on display starting with the antipasti table. We received a nicely located corner table for four people next to the windows. The restaurant uses iPads as well as printed menus. I did have difficulty navigating the wine list on the iPad because it froze up. I was brought a second unit which encountered the same problem. Our server stated they were having problems with the wireless service. Thank goodness for low tech paper menus.  The dinner menu is wide and varied with many appetizers, pastas, seafood and meat dishes. The wine by the glass selection not extensive but did have some moderately price choices. Our server Turley was friendly and helpful. The following was ordered for our party of four. Appetizers: Orzo Meatballs were 5 to an order and tender with a tasty Pomodoro sauce. Clams Casino topped with prosciutto, a new twist on an old school item. A large bowl of about 25 small clams were juicy and more than enough for four people.  Entrees: Branzino - 3 crispy skin filets served with arugula and tangerine vinaigrette were tender and juicy Veal Chop Saltimbocca Milanese style - A very large portion which was very tasty Rack of Lamb - 4 chops cooked perfectly as ordered medium rare 7 oz Filet of Beef - comes with polenta but potatoes were requested as a substitute. The potatoes were tender balls dusted with cheese. The filet was ordered well done but several pieces were a little pink. Overall a nice piece of meat.    Desserts: The dessert cart has a variety of treats that were beautifully displayed and explained to us. Our choices were: Chocolate Sorbet Coffee Gelato Tiramisu  Our server offered complementary dessert to compensate for the steak. Although that was not expected or necessary it demonstrated the staff's willingness to satisfy the customer.",

I would say that the food was adequate - but for the overpriced food and very, very small portions, One would expect excellent food. This was not the case and I will not come back. My wife had soup and I was shocked by the small amount of liquid in the dish. My Caesar salad was nothing special. The rigatoni is dance and the pasta was overcooked. I was very disappointed.",

However, the food and service were underwhelming, to say the least.  It took forever to get noticed, given menus, and get our drinks. The cheese plate appetizers we ordered were good (although they were out of burrata and they substituted it without asking). The entrees were disappointing. A relatively small portion of bland risotto for $34? No thanks. The polenta was even blander, which is a feat. The lobster tail was slightly over cooked. For the cost, Giada is definitely not worth it. I won't return.",

    "text": "Maybe this place gets awards for Brunch and Power Lunch but it deserves no awards for dinner.  BOTTOM LINE: For the price, there are much better meals to be had in Vegas. Go find them instead of having dinner here.  The food itself is good, I'd give it four stars.  The wines are typical of Vegas, jacked up five times what you'd pay for them at the winery.  The service overall here is a below average for a restaurant with those prices. The staff is trying but they need far more polish if they're going to be serving $55+ entrees.  The management at this restaurant is non-existent and that's the real problem.  I've eaten at thousands of restaurants all over the world and I don't say this lightly...whomever is the manager for the dinner shift on weeknights at Giada should be fired.  We had a party of 7 with an 8:30pm reservation on a Wednesday night in February. That shouldn't be hard to service, right? WRONG.  We arrived at the hostess station exactly on time. The hostess told us our table \"wasn't quite ready\" and we could go to the bar and they'd come to get us when it was ready.  After sitting in the bar area for fifteen minutes, no one even asked us if we wanted a drink. Normally at restaurants I go to, if you're sitting at the bar this long past the time of your reservation, the manager will come over, apologize profusely and comp your drinks: Not at Giada. At Giada they simply ignore you.  Finally after fifteen minutes of no one saying a word to us, one of the women in our party flags down a cocktail waitress and we order drinks. A hostess then comes by to tell us yet again that our table \"isn't quite ready\".  Another fifteen minutes go by and we get our drinks finally. It's now THIRTY minutes past our reservation time and we're still NOT seated. No apologies from anyone, nothing. Instead a hostess comes by a third time to tell us our table is \"almost ready\".  FORTY THREE MINUTES after our reservation time, a hostess comes to tell us our table is ready. During this forty three minutes we were not visited at all by anyone in charge of the restaurant. No maitre d' or manager of this restaurant has stopped by to apologize for such a RIDICULOUS wait or possibly comp the drink we had while waiting!!! Nothing! No one! Who runs that restaurant? Giada herself should be ashamed to put her name on a restaurant with such atrocious service! We pay our bar bill, which for some reason can't be transferred to our table, and finally go to be seated.  As we sit down, one of the women in our party slips on the slippery wood floor and her white wine flies in the air, spilling all over her dress. Only one waiter comes to her aid. Two other restaurant patrons help her more than the staff did.  As we're finally seated, another woman in our party tells the waiter about our 45 minute wait past our reservation. He had no idea we'd been waiting that long. He said he was sorry but he didn't get the manager to come over either. I've never in my life had to wait 45 minutes past my reservation to get seated. And I've never been ignored by restaurant management before. If I were Giada, I'd be furious at that manager and demand   The waiter gave us some sort of elderberry concoction by way of apology for our wait, but the complete unprofessionalism of the place just threw the whole meal off for all of us.  Unless they get real professional management for this restaurant, avoid it.",

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm welcomes from everyone we encountered. We were visited by management twice throughout our dinner to see how we were doing. Our waiter, Greg, gave us great recommendations and even steered us away from a few menu items. The sommelier visited our table to assist with the wine selection.   Started with medium-sized Giada favorites antipasti - bacon wrapped dates, stuffed baby bells, veal crostini, pea pesto crostini, and caponata. Even the bread basket was delicious! Main course was the bucatini and the 28 oz bone in Tuscan ribeye. Served with a side of crispy polenta and sweet corn with spicy sausage. For dessert we had the trio of tiramisu. Everything was delicious!  We ordered a lot of food for two people but wanted to try a bit of as much as we could. It was an amazing experience and we will definitely be dining there again next time we're in Vegas. Ask for a seat by the window to take in the views throughout your meal.",

I ordered the Lasagna thinking it would look like most American servings if Lasagna a square piece with layers of noodles and meat sauce. This  server brought me something the size of a silver dollar. Hell I thought it was an appetizer or something. I asked what that was, he said it's the Lasagna you ordered. I started laughing thinking he was just messing with us.... he wasn't. I ate it in about 3 bites.   The worst value in the damn city for the food they give you. They should be ashamed of themselves for that, but, it Vegas baby. If you don't have any money stay your ass at home. Giada won't have to worry about getting anymore of my money again.",

We also shared the sausage and eggplant lasagna, which was well seasoned but the portion may have been a tad small for the price. It did come with an arugula salad in the side, though. We also had a salumi flatbread -- dried salami that resembled pepperoni -- and the orzo meatballs.  We also started with a gooey chocolate croissant monkey bread, the size of a muffin.    The service was really good, once the server came to our table.  They did a great job refilling out complimentary coffee and our waters.  We asked about the famous bread basket but learned it was only available at dinner.  We were offered Parmesan cracker bread on the house, and it was divine.

Been a fan of hers for quite some time, not to mention my mom loves her, so we had to check this place out. Kinda felt like the other reviews are spot on; pricey and a little underwhelming.  The place itself is beautiful, wonderful location on the 2nd floor of the Cromwell with really nice views of the strip, especially when the sun is going down.  Bread was solid w/different varieties and was great to dip with our entrees. As apps we tried the calamari and dates which were ok, but what stood out was the chicken marsala meatballs.. Super tender, in a broth that would of been good by itself. Dipping the bread in that broth was excellent, everyone loved it.  Entree's were solid, recommend getting the cacio e pepe as it's cooked in a cheese wheel that they bring out and you can eat parts of the cheese wheel too, enough for 2-4 ppl imo depending on how much you wanna carb it up. Really enjoyed how the pasta wasn't over cooked and it was nice and thick.  Also had the fried chicken that was really good as well, tasted Nashville style which I like (crispy and hot!) Overall it was just ok, ambience and layout of the restaurant is very nice, just don't think the price and quality is worth it to come here frequently, but will try it again.",

    "text": "I'll admit that I had really low expectations going into Giada based on reviews I read ahead of time. My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by our Christmas morning brunch. I have only good things to say about my experience.  We made reservations a couple of days ahead of time and had our pick of times. I chose noon because I prefer to enjoy my holiday feast early in the day. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and taken to our table. We were seated next to the window which was nice for people watching.  Since it was Christmas we were offered the regular brunch menu as well as the Christmas prix fixe menu. We opted for the Christmas menu since it offered a variety of dishes from the menu.   I started with a drink called the Dolce Vita which was really delicious. It was nice that there were some interesting drinks on the menu that were alcohol free. Next up we were brought an assortment of pastries and antipasto. The pastries were out of this world. My favorite was the Nutella pastry because it was so buttery and flaky. The texture and taste were delicious. The antipasto included bacon wrapped dates, polenta, and goat cheese stuffed peppers. I don't usually like bacon wrapped dates, but these were amazing. The polenta was also very tasty.   My main entree was the Sausage and Eggplant Lasagna. This was served with a small arugula salad. The lasagna was truly delicious. The arugula salad had a nice dressing that was well seasoned. My husband had the Italian Chicken & Waffles. If possible, this dish was even better than mine. The chicken had the most amazing seasoning and crispy crust with tender chicken inside. The savory style waffles were good too.   The end to the meal came in the form of a lemon souffle for me and ricotta ice cream sandwiches for my husband. My yummy souffle was served with a delicious gelato. My husband absolutely loved the ricotta cookie ice cream sandwiches. I tried a bite and agreed that they were amazing. The cookies had a great texture and taste with delicious raspberry gelato in between.  Our waiter was great and very professional. He was great at making sure we had full water glasses and that we had everything we needed during our meal. The staff also took great care to be sure we were finished with dishes before clearing anything from the table. All of our courses were perfectly timed.   Don't miss the photo booth behind the black curtain next to the hostess stand before you leave! What a great idea and a nice memento of a nice meal.",

The food was good, but something inside me wanted a little more. Not in portion size, but in flavor. As a Food Network junkie who has dined at Bobby Flay's, Emeril's, Paula Deen's, and Guy Fieri's restaurants, Miss Giada needs to kick it up a notch and she'll be golden!  Here's what me and my fam bam ordered during brunch:  Pastry Assortment   A+  Salmon Cake Benedict   B Strawberry Polenta Waffle   A- Sardinian Gnocchi al Pomodoro   C+ Chicken Meatballs A++  On the way out, there's a cool photo booth - and it's free. Another nice touch by Giada and a smart marketing tool to capture emails of her patrons.",

Our waiter Rocco was great but may have had one table too many for this price point. He was very knowledgeable and detail oriented. A great waiter.  We had the artichoke appetizer and the bacon wrapped dates. The dates were amazing the artichoke was ok. I'll try the meatballs next time.   Main entrees were Halibut, Spaghetti, Pork Chop and lobster ravioli.  I had the pork chop and it was great. A high quality cut, grilled to perfection, but the peach glaze was heavenly!  We ordered one side, a lemon potato dish. Man o man!  That was amazing!  For desert we had coffee which was actually Americanos. A bit more bitter than a typical Americano. The souffle was spectacular if you are into souffles. It was so light it was nearly a meringue.   My two very minor negative thoughts are:  The silverware used for the appetizer course was annoyingly unbalanced and hard to use. I found myself more focused on trying not to drop my silverware than being able to enjoy the appetizers.  My waiter would have been so much more attentive had he had one less table.   Obviously, four star means these are minor. We had a great time and a great meal!",

The restaurant opened at 5 and we arrived at around 5:08 after wasting time on the tables downstairs.  (That wasn't a good idea).   The place is lovely and right off of the elevator.  We did not have reservations and the hostess said that she can get us a reservation at 5:15.  Okay, so... we had a \"reservation\" for 7 minutes after we arrived.  We said okay and decided to wait at the bar of course.  While walking to the bar, we realized that there is about 4 people max in the restaurant area.  So why did we have to wait you ask?  Good question.    Once we got to the bar, Beau the bartender asked if we were dining at the bar.  Good idea Beau!  Since they wouldn't seat us. So we dined at the bar with beau.  Beau was good and attentive and Max was good as well.    The food:  White Lasagna - taste decent. Really small portion Lobster Ravioli - portion like an appetizer Wine - good complimentary bread - good   After we ate, we were still friggin' hungry so we ordered a pizza appetizer. It was small and fresh.  Taste decent.  So all in all, it was a nice place with nice service.  But for $120 I would like a better portion, and to be seated when seats are available.   The end.",

All of the food was a la charge but very small portion sizes that were extremely overpriced. The pizzas were the size of a grapefruit. The sides were pretty good portions and the potatoes were good, but nothing to come back for. We split the famous roast chicken and it came out bone. dry.  We felt so bad bc we never sent food back, but when you're spending 60 + on a chicken dish, it just made sense to see if they would redo it. They did and it was much better, but once again nothing  to come back for. The service was really great and I hope they make some changes to make it a viable place on the strip.",

I can't remember the name of the dessert but it was good. I believe it had caramel in it. The portions were the only thing that bothered me. The usual high prices for small portions that some high end restaurants have. Nice ambience and attentive staff.",

    "text": "After hearing so many good things about Giada, I made reservations for Thanksgiving Day. The restaurant is beautiful and has an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains. The service is also excellent, but I can't say the food was anything to rave about. I hoped there would be a vegetarian entree on the fixed price menu, but the only entree was a turkey dinner. I ordered off the regular menu and my brother had the turkey dinner. I'd read good things about the lemon spaghetti, so I ordered it, minus the shrimp. The first couple of bites were good, but overall, the whole dish was just too dry. I didn't eat more than 3-4 bites. I thought, fine, I'll have room for dessert. I ordered the Bomboloni (Italian donuts). There are 6 to 8 in one order (I think), and the first one was to die for. The rest of them had all stuck together during cooking, like one big ball of smaller ones. They were all undercooked and sticky on the inside. My brother said the turkey dinner was very good. I'm sorry, I just couldn't say the same for my dinner. I think Giada is a place you should try at least once, but I doubt I'll be going back.",

We chose to get the 4 course sampler menu. It was $120 a person....kinda pricey but for a special experience was amazing!!  First the appetizer sampler platter came. The bacon wrapped figs were a mouthgasm! The stuffed peppers were a party in your mouth. The seared steak crustini was sophisticated.   Then the antipasto. The lemon shrimp spaghetti was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted.   The main course I had the half roasted chicken cacciatore. Dear god almighty it was delicious.   And then the grand finale!! They brought a dessert cart out with like 15 different desserts. I had settled on the five layer moose cake....then the magical words that blew my mind came...each of us got to pick three different desserts!!!   I ended up with the 5 layer moose cake, the classic cheesecake, and finally a chocolate chunk cookie. All were amazing...and then to top it off they brought two more lemon ricotta cookies!!   This was such a treat in my culinary life. It was costly, $300 for two of us without alcohol. But for a once in a life experience, it was a must!!",

A table was ready not too long after we arrived however the hostess asked whether we would be willing to wait a little longer for a table closer to the window. We opted to wait. We probably waited an additional 20 min or so but the time passed quickly because we discovered the photo booth and had lots of fun with that.   Regarding the food, I enjoyed every single thing that was ordered. We opted for the a la carte menu as opposed to the pri fixe because there were several things on the a la carte that I wanted to try that were not on pri fix. Also the pri fix menu required that everyone at the table chose this option and we did not want to do this.   The food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. Appetizers came out at the same time as the main dishes which was surprising but not unwelcomed.   I had the Bacon wrapped dates, Burrata, Bresaola (Salumi) and 7oz Filet. Burrata was delicious- only thing that surprised me was that it came out on a platter on its own without any bread or crackers. I had to ask for bread for the Burrata. The bacon wrapped dates were by far my favorite - sweet, savory and spicy all in one. (I enjoyed these so much that my husband even tried to replicate at home.)  Overall very good experience and would definitely come again.",

I was so excited to try out her restaurant, but unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by her restaurant at the Cromwell, neither by food or decor. It does have awesome views though.  We started out with the assortment of bread, and two HUGE veggie, meat and cheese platters. I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, sweet peppers and the bacon wrapped dates. It was a lot of food, very salty too. The breads are yummy! Was truly full by the time we were done with it and a lot was left untouched. For the main I got the Shrimp Spaghetti - the shrimp was overcooked, pasta was okay and warm-ish -  let's just say disappointed... or maybe it's the full belly talkin, but either way overcooked tough shrimp on a signature dish is not cool. After that we indulged in 4 different desserts with coffee (souffle (it takes 15-20 minutes btw), chocolate torte, chocolate tiramisu and lemon hazelnut torte) The lemon dessert was good - nice and tart.  And boo, the photobooth was broken. Service was good, our waiter with a thick Italian accent was charming, answered all our questions, paced the dishes out nicely and checked in on us often. But considering everything else I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "We went to Giada's last night for dinner and it was amazing! We had a party of six so we were able to try multiple different things. I will tell you now that if you are looking for huge American sized portions this is not the place for you, however, the sizes also aren't tiny as you can see in the photos people have posted. Personally I think they're just right.  Location - the restaurant is located on in Cromwell and it faces Cesar's Palace, Paris Paris, and the Bellagio. It has a huge round window that allows you to see all of those places with a great view. The decor is cute and all of the tables have nice, really comfortable chairs.   Service - I honestly can't say enough about the service. Our server, Rado, was extremely nice, informative, talkative, and attentive. He really made our experience top notch, along with all of the other servers who kept our table clean, brought our dishes, and helped us with the wine selection.   Food - Oh the food. Wow. They start you with this tray of the most amazing rosemary focaccia bread, Parmesan crisps, pesto oil, lemon butter, chili flakes and sea salt. SO GOOD. We ordered the seafood tower and chicken marsala meatballs. Both were great, the meatballs were juicy and flavorful and al of the items on the seafood tower were cooked and seasoned very well. My party ordered the salmon, veal with fried brussels sprouts, lobster ravioli, whole roasted chicken with lemon potatoes, and spaghetti. All of it was prepared to perfection. And the brussels sprouts, OMG. I am not even a fan of them usually but these were prepared in a pancetta oil and came with Parmesan and pomegranate seeds. My boyfriend ordered them but I probably ate 75% of them. I couldn't stop! We finished with lemon ricotta cookies thanks to my Yelp check in. They were delicious as well.   I would highly recommend this place to everyone, and ask for Rado!",

It has become a joke among my friends - that I always drag them to Giada. I have traveled the world, am a travel editor on two magazine mastheads, and eat out more than I even want to! I know great restaurants, and great service.  Yes, I love Giada herself, but I also just love the ambiance and the food here. I live in New York City, so prices don't scare me off. What has really gotten so terrible is the service. The hostess greets you as if it is your privilege to be dining there. Then, if you're not willing to commit to paying $150 a person for a \"window seat,\" you are shown to a \"toilet\" seat (airplane analogy). Which is funny since Giada's motto is \"Eat a little of everything, not a lot of anything.\" I wonder if $150 a person is \"not a lot of anything.\" Then - the timing is always just off. If you don't tell them anything, your meal takes four hours. If you tell them you need to leave by a certain time, your meal takes five minutes (but then you can't find the server to pay).   Again, the food is good to great, the ambiance is needed on the Strip (if you were allowed to sit at ANY table...), and I love Giada. But there are still so many service-related problems here four years after opening. There must be a ton of turnover.",

It contained bourbon, blackberries, and rosemary, along with one or two other ingredients I cannot remember off the top of my head. We we need up drinking these delicious cocktails (we referred to them as Katie's bourbon & rosemary cocktails) the rest of the night.   The hostess arrived and then sat us with a table with gorgeous views of the Bellagio's fountain. Just like everyone said, this restaurant is very well thought out so that almost all the tables have views of the city.   Our attentive & adorable waiter, Rocco, then lead us through culinary bliss. His recommendations were spot on as we started off with bacon wrapped dates, prosciutto, and the gorgonzola cheese with honey appetizers. Then, we enjoyed Giada's signature spaghetti along with the raviolli. Topped off by s'mores gelati.   Overall, the food was good. However, what made this place special was the people who work there. Katie & Rocco were some of the best we have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. Very professional and pleasant.  We highly recommend Giada's restaurant to anyone wanting a special night out!",

I set up the reservation, we made it to the restaurant, and our high expectations for the restaurant and menu were met. The both of us ordered the tasting menu and were given several courses of incredible food, including the main course of the italian fried chicken Cacciatore. My wife only had 2 bites of her main course before being full, and I ended up eating all of mine. The both of us were satisfied and impressed by both staff and food, paid the bill, and left to catch a show we had tickets for. That's when the sweats set in. An hour or two after the meal my romantic anniversary weekend was cut short and two days of hellish toilet time started. We ended up cutting our trip short despite having already paid for the hotel, deciding to fight through the food poisoning at home rather than in Vegas. My wife and I deduced that Giada caused my misfortune as we shared the same things for all of our meals, the only difference being that I had ate all of my chicken whereas she only had 2 bites. She did experience a little nausea but nothing compared to the faith questioning pain I'm going through. Be careful with undercooked chicken.",

Your name is Giada and so is your restaurant.  I've been to a lot of places to eat and can't think of anywhere I've ever seen such a thing.  Before we got to see all of her monogrammed items, we had to wait for a table.  The hostess said we could sit at the bar with no wait, or wait 20 minutes for a table.  Since we were all starving, we walked into the bar to get a seat to avoid the wait.  Well that's humorous because there is maybe 6 bar stools and they were all taken.  Then the other couches and table in the area are just a waiting area, not a place to sit and eat.  So back to the lobby we go.  While we walked back out to get on the wait list, I looked over and the restaurant was practically empty!  They we're only seating the tables around the edge by the window.  All the other tables stayed empty.  I'm guessing b/c it was lunch or maybe lack of servers but whatever the case, not a great first impression.  Once seated our server was very professional.  (I think Stephanie was her name).  I ordered the Lemon Pesto Grilled Cheese with heirloom tomatoes because I love lemon, pesto, and grilled cheese sandwiches so how could this be a miss.  The server recommended I add the Prosciutto di Parma which was at an upcharge of coarse that I didn't notice but still added per her recommendation.  Unfortunately this sandwich was a huge disappointment.  The lemon pesto and prosciutto was all I tasted.  The sandwich was over cooked so if there was any cheese on it, it had all melted off and was non detectable.  And those were not heirloom tomatoes.  Small, flimsy, roma tomatoes at best.  I picked it apart and tried to eat some of the bread but it was just not good.  What was good though was the Spinach & Buffalo Ricotta Pizza.  The dough was so fresh and the pizza offered great flavor.  The only thing about it I found flavorless was the thinly sliced porchetta on top.  This was not a restaurant I had bookmarked and could have gone without visiting during this Las Vegas vacation, but when your starving and tired of trying to make a decision, you take what you can get.",

As expected, it's expensive.  Had breakfast there with a friend - good service, good food and great coffee ($6 for a large cup.)  I ordered a \"hash\" and enjoyed the mix of eggs, veggies and sausage - not typical diner slop.  In all, I really enjoyed Giada's restaurant.  4 stars",

Service was incredible for the most part. Our party of four-everyone loved their fancy cocktails and the food. The only criticism i have is my Eggplant Appitizer was under-cooked and tough to cut into, but everything else we had was delicious!  We had a beautiful experience and i would go back. A big perk is the view of the Beliggio dancing fountains from most seats in the restaurant and the view in general is spectacular, the windows open - like French Doors a lovely touch!",

I asked the hostess to charge my phone and she plugged it at a register close by. When I asked my waiter to bring it to me he said it wasn't there, i had to stand up, and started getting stressed! Then he said e was going to ask around, he came back saying he was sorry but it wasn't there. I was about to yell and he laughed saying it was a joke! I literally asked for the check and left!",

Inside the Cromwell hotel (where Drais is located) we went up on the escalators and there was the hostess station at the end of the escalator.  We were invited to go to the bar and have a drink while waiting for our table.  That's exactly what we did.  Their menu of cocktails was on the ipad.  We just ended up getting our usuals.  Our hostess finally seated us.   We were approached by Cliff, our fantastic waiter! He was very accommodating and friendly.  He made us feel warm and welcomed.  Very personable.  His Hawaiian accent is great also! He took care of us.  So 5 STARS for CLIFF!  As for food, I'll rank it 3.  The plates are small.  I ordered the lobster ravioli.  Which was a bit too lemony for my taste.  My bf ordered the risotto and scallops.  That dish was much better than mine.  Bread plate came out first,  I really liked the freshly baked bread on the bread plate that we got served. The resto itself was pretty pricey.  It's nice to try new things.  Sadly, I don't think i'll come back  Overall, I had a good experience with this place. ambiance, excellent service and the PHOTOBOOTH! That by far was my favorite part in the whole experience!  Thanks again Cliff! YOU ARE AMAZING!",

Loved the 2 types of sangria--both delicious in their own way (red was sweet but not too sweet, and the white a uniquely dry sangria).  Tiramisu good but not earth shattering like I hoped for, from the Italian goddess herself.  I would go back the next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "We weren't planning to eat here and hadn't even perused the menu online. One of the reasons I had intentionally not put this restaurant in the \"must try category\" was the less than 4 stars on yelp which are abundant in Vegas. Yet somehow, we found ourselves hungry at lunch and no plan...a bit of an anomaly for an avid foodie/yelper!  Sometimes flying by the seat of the pants is so much better though.  Walked passed Mon Ami Gabi and were both tempted go back as their steak/frites and moules/frites are a safe bet. But time to venture to something new and I remembered that Giada's was just another block up the strip.  As we headed up the escalators in the Cromwell, two ladies were descending and their friend hollered up....\"how was it?\" One called down...\"I had the lobster roll which was fantastic!\"  I looked at my husband and said, \"it's gonna be pricey...but I don't care how much it is...I've been craving a lobster roll and I'm going to order it!\"  So we sit down in this gorgeous very un-las-vegas-ey style restaurant....meaning bright and open with awesome feng-shui. I was hooked as soon as I melted into a nice comfortable club chair with a good amount of space between tables.     In addition to the lobster roll (which was a whopping $37) we ordered the Salumi Picante pizza that totaled only $16.  They were both really beyond fantastic. The salumi was nothing like I've tasted before...a bit spicy but not too oily.  The crust was on the thicker side but light and airy at the same time. Giada knows her pizza!  The lobster at first looked small...that was deceiving because it was open faced so the entire 1 1/2 inches on top was all lobster. We decided it must have been well over a pound of lobster perfectly dressed in the lightest aioli with fried capers...never would have though of that but it worked well. In fact, this was one of the best lobster rolls I've ever tried.    They get knocked one star because wine by the glass is pretty steep so we ended up getting a bottle of French wine on the lower end of the price range...Vouvray Francois Pinon.  Our server immediately informed us that they serve that one by the glass at Spago where he used to work and it is delicious. Ok, that made us feel better about our choice, and much to our surprise, it was the perfect choice....light and not too buttery or oaky.    The service was wonderful and even with the steep wine prices I would definitely return.",

My favorite was the featured bread plate of the day because there were many things to try not just one chunk of bread to eat. I had the ravioli and my sister the cucumber soup and risotto. All delicious!:)   It was chilly in the restaurant but most places are freezing in Vegas so no surprise there. Unfortunately the neighboring server to Lauren's section was rude and I could hear his nasty comments about his coworkers to his tables. No thanks.   Lauren was great though!

We made a reservation through the \"Open Table\" app that same evening. The ambiance and food was all good, what we expected and more. I just didn't like the place we were seated. We were right next to the podium where the waiters would input orders and process payments. I cannot even count how many times I heard \"excuse me or sorry\" while eating our dinner. We were seated with the view of \"The Strip\" but did not like that the podium was so close behind me.  The photo booth is a fun touch and cool souvenir since you can text or email it to yourself or free.  The other thing that bothered me was they have the hostesses all in uniform, but for a \"supposed\" classy place almost every hostess had tattoos and that ruined it for me. Because then it seemed like they should be working a street corner. At least the gentlemen wore coats and looked more professional.  The food was fantastic we ordered the chicken meatballs, the white pasta, and the arugula salad.",

I must say I wasn't disappointed we had a few small plate's my friend had been there before and ordered for us. I loved everything the dates wrapped with bacon yummy we had the cheese plate and then to top it off we had pasta it was a very small dish and not enough to share but, I was full by the time it came to the table I loved it! The service was good and they really let you sit there and enjoy your meal which I like, if you love red wine I recommend you order \"if you see Kay\" play on words lol",

I cancelled our other reservations  in order to go back to try the dinner menu and I'm glad we did. If you only can go to one of her meals (try to go to more) go to dinner. I recommend bacon wrapped dates, shrimp lemon spaghetti, mushroom risotto and the antipasto n apps dishes. We tried for dessert the lemoncello souffle, which melted in ur mouth but i have to say the cookies were a two timed ordered favorite!     We came back a month later just to come back to Giada's (3 more times in 3 days lol)  I ordered bacon wrapped spicy sausage stuffed dates each time. We ordered the salumi plate and the gorgonzola n pear honey plate ;). We had the Veal chop Milanese which was wonderful n quite hardy, the Filet Mignon which was like butter and the Lobster raviolis. The service is impeccable every time and if the weather permits the window tables are open n you have a beautiful breeze while dining.    We tried the white chocolate gelato, the hazelnut gelato, the raspberry sorbet and the peach Bellini sorbet this time. If you fancy a bellini, you will love it but our favorite was the white chocolate gelato and their cookie platter.  As you can see we love this place n hope u do too!",

They were busy even though we had reservations but we were able to wait at the bar. I love how knowledgeable and friendly the barista was.  On to the food, I ordered the famous shrimp pasta! Wow, wow, wow! Best pasta dish ever and those were some jumbo shrimp! I know some people have complained about the size of the dish but maybe you don't know how to eat quality food. I love food in general, and can't say I eat at expensive restaurants often, but what I will say is of the food is always this good, I will pay every dollar for it, even if I don't have leftovers to take home. My husband ordered the steak dish and he was impressed and satisfied! & he is a meat eater!  I strongly believe this place deserves all 5 stars! The bad reviews almost scared me away from trying this place but I'm glad I didn't. Hope you try it if you haven't already.",

    "text": "Dining at Giada was great. However, I will start this review off by saying I WISH I HAD COME FOR DINNER. The lunch menu is significantly limited compared to their dinner offerings. For example, there are only 3 pasta options for lunch. Imagine my disappointment when I learned the lemon shrimp spaghetti that everyone raved about on yelp is NOT offered on the lunch menu, only dinner!   But, I digress. AMBIANCE: Located on the 2nd floor of the Cromwell, the restaurant is beautiful. Let's be honest, Giada is beautiful. She is probably my only and real \"woman crush.\" The restaurant ambiance and decor emulate her. It's very inviting, spacious, elegant, yet also homey. Not to mention a great view of the Bellagio. We requested a view of the fountains like everyone said and they were able to oblige.   FOOD/DRINKS: The Sangria ($15) was pretty and tasted as good as it looked. Lunch menu had a bunch of appetizers, pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. Again, super limited pasta menu, and no additional entrees... or at least I can't remember any. Things I tried: ORZO MEATBALLS ($10)- okay, lots of flavor and the sauce they came in was good. A good appetizer to start.  WOOD MUSHROOMS ($14)- tasty and tender. But super small.  PESTO LEMON GRILLED CHEESE WITH PROSCIUTTO AND TOMATO ($22)- the prosciutto is an extra $4, you can get it without for $18. I couldn't really taste it because it was so thin, it really only made it a little more salty. The lemon flavor wasn't too prevalent either. The main flavor here is the pesto. It was good but $18 for a grilled cheese sandwich? Ponder that for a min. All sandwiches come with your choice of salad or fried zucchini strips. Get the zucchini strips, they're still vegetables! Thus, you can feel less guilty about them.  SAUSAGE PIZZA- pretty good but also quite oily. Probably wouldn't get next time.  CAPRESE SALAD ($19)- the heirloom tomatoes were excellent and the mozzarella was delicious.  EGGPLANT AND SAUSAGE LASAGNA ($24)- This was really good. The size is just right.   SERVICE: friendly, competent, attentive when needed, but nothing really remarkable in this area.   Overall, Giada is my homegirl, but I'll have to come back for dinner. The limitations of the lunch menu was surprising. Also, it's obviously a pricey place... but if you can splurge, I'd definitely recommend you try her. I did it just because I like her so much. It's absolutely more of a special occasions only type of place.",

The ambiance, food, music selection and service was perfect. We enjoyed an adult beverage at the bar by bartender Max who happens to be a fantastic mixologist. We were then seated in a window table with a great view. The spaghetti, salmon and rack of lamb were equally wonderful and highly recommended.   The tables are somewhat close together but we met new friends and had an interesting conversation so it didn't bother us. The SO has decided to bring his clients here tomorrow evening, and I also am planning on returning soon. Thank you Giada for a spectacular evening.",

    "text": "My mom and I had a 5:00 reservation on 8/12/16. We are locals and have been wanting to eat at Giada's for awhile. We took the escalators up to the restaurant and were greeted by the rudest and most non welcoming hostesses who lacked personality and tact. First impressions are everything and they certainly left a sour taste in our mouth.   We went to the bar for a drink before we were seated. The bartender was friendly and soon to find out it would be the best part of our experience.  We were seated in the middle of the restaurant. We asked to be moved to the window to which  the hostess stated \"the servers aren't on shift over there so it would be another 15 minute wait.\" We declined as we had a show at 7pm at another hotel. The music is regular pop music. I prefer Italian music at an Italian restaurant on the strip to make you feel like you are having a full dining experience.   We started with appetizers with the Margherita Pizzette. Extremely small and extremely doughy. The toppings, including the cheese fell off the pizza as soon as you took a bite. We also ordered the Artichoke Arancini which was very good. The bread served was pretty good as well. For our main dishes we both ordered Pasta Primavera which is not on the menu, but it is something we wanted. They were willing to make it which was nice. When it was served they did not offer to grate cheese over the pastas. (isn't that what we come to Italian restaurants for? Cheese on pasta!?) We asked for cheese and they brought it. Portions were small for the price. Overall mediocre pasta. Our server was friendly but often disappeared. Our bus boy was friendly as well.   The tables are on top of each other so naturally you strike up a convo with the people sitting next to you which is fine, but leaves little privacy.   I absolutely would not go back to the restaurant. I can guarantee it is only a short while until it is closed as the reviews are awful for the price and the taste. Poorly done restaurant. Not impressed in the slightest bit and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are WAY better local spots to enjoy an Italian meal. By far one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Simply put, one of the best meals I've had in a while. After recent disappointing meals at other Italian spots on the Strip this was a huge relief. Cocktails, named and inspired after the movies of Giada's grandfather Dino De Laurentiis, are excellent and reasonably priced for the Strip at $15 each.   Don't overlook the first page of the menu -- antipasti and pizzettes -- because there are some gems among them. The lobster arancini starts creamy with a touch of sweetness and finishes with a  spicy kick. Taleggio and an olive tapenade are paired beautifully for a salty hit. The hard pecorino cheese is complimented by the sweetness from apricot preserves. The thin, delicate prosciutto di parma is accompanied by two types of mustard -- one sharp and pungent and another that is slightly sweeter.  Both pastas we tried showcased Giada's California-Italian hybrid cooking -- pastas that don't have the heaviness of stereotypical Italian food. Well seasoned and creamy risotto was mixed with crab and sat between two beautifully seared scallops. Giada's famed spaghetti can challenge for the best in town. The hints of citrus worked, giving the dish a light and fresh profile.  There's a dessert cart they roll around, but according to our waiter it's only available to those who order the tasting menu. The rest of us are only presented a menu to choose from. The apple tart is a decent option, with apples prepared three ways, atop a flaky pastry foundation with brown butter frangipane, cinnamon gelato, and gold flakes on top.  They also have a kids menu available for those that want to bring their little ones. We brought ours and he loved his noodles and had a s'mores gelato ice cream sandwich for dessert. For $11 kid's get their choice of entree and the ice cream sandwich. Quite   aa bargain compared to what other restaurants on the Strip will charge kids.  The casual elegant atmosphere is perfect for special nights outs or just hanging out with friends in a somewhat upscale environment. Despite the celebrity chef hype, Giada proved to be a surprisingly good restaurant that exceeded expectations and delivered an unforgettable dining experience.",

What came as a sweet surprise was the out of this world AMAZING service we received. Avi, Napolean, Nathan, and Grecie turned an otherwise nice dinner into a spectacular one.

All of it about a 6/10 IMHO. next course - lemon pasta with giant tiger shrimp and penne with vegetable Bolognese - both excellent 9/10.  Next course salmon with capers - too rich and overcooked 5/10, plus faro with cranberries and pine nuts - delicious 8 /10.

    "text": "I am giving the food 3.5 stars and the cocktails 5 for a total of 4 stars.   It's not that the food was bad. It was good. Better than I was expecting actually. I always thought that Giada was riding the coattails of her grandfather and her good looks with all the success she has had within the food industry and that the food would rate right in there with Carrabas or Papa Vinos but it was actually pretty decent. They are still pretty new at this point so they have plenty of time to up their game.  It was great being able to see a lot of the ingredients they were using kept in plain sight of the diners. Everything looked fresh and delicious. I think they have a great concept going on here and should do just fine. My advice? Bring the food up a notch or the price down a notch and you will be right in the pocket.  The desserts were delicious. They bring out a cart filled with 3 shelves of desserts. It made for a great presentation. We all had something different and everyone was blown away.   Now as far as the bar goes... bartender Eric Hobbie made us some cocktails that were 100% off the chain... and off the menu for that matter! He improvised a few cocktails for us based on our likes and dislikes. A True artist in love with his craft is always a great find and Giada, or whoever hand picked this guy, hit a grand slam. We will be going back just to sit with Eric again and experience some more liquid gold. The entire bar staff offered great service and were all very knowledgeable about everything on the menu.   On a side note, the manager asked one of my party to remove their hat, which they did without question or attitude and the manager even apologized over and over but it still bothered me a little, although it didn't bother my friend in the least bit. And, for the record,  I don't blame the manager, he was just doing his job and he was very polite and professional about it. I blame the owners. I think it's time for some of these upscale strip restaurants to get over themselves. Good food is for everyone and we spend quite a bit of money when we go sit down and start eating and drinking. We liked the drinks and had a good time at the bar so we will probably go back, but if we had to make a decision based on food alone... trust me, we wouldn't be going back to the room to change. There are plenty of Italian fine dining  restaurants that don't mind a baseball cap or two at their bar for hours.   Actually, Giada is probably doing a disservice to a lot of her fans. I would guess that if you polled a lot of the people that would be interested in eating Giada's food you would probably find that a good percentage of them wear ball caps or have husbands/boyfriends that wear ball caps on the strip. So come on Giada, when it gets down to the nitty gritty, your fame came from the same channel that spawned Fieri so lets not get too uppity just yet. You have to earn it.",

It's hard to live up to the authentic characteristics of a True Italian margherita pizza and this place did it.  The crust was crispy yet fluffy fresh in the middle, thin bottom, sweet and fresh roma tomatoes, ample amount of fresh mozzarella, topped with fresh and large pieces of basil.  I want more!!  The lasagna from initial reaction was rather small in size when presented in the bakeware.  Once you dive in, it was power packed with flavors from the meat, cheese, flat lasagna noodles and sauce.  Unbelievable taste.  Served with a small arugula salad.    For dessert we had the zeppoli - my God, this was amazing.  The chocolate drizzle that you dip the donuts in was mouthwatering.  I also ordered a red sangria - perfection.  Everything about this visit was flawless.  We will definitely be back again.  The atmosphere is fancy but not too showy or intimidating.  The views are just as good as The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.    Woohoo Giada!",

    "text": "NO TV SHOW !! here just the real deal you all must read this befor going first of all if you think you're just going to walk in to the restaurant and get a table you're joking you must make reservations. So for those of you are complaining about waiting make reservations next time. I also read the reviews on service I could tell you service was excellent staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Also for those of you are complaining about price you should check the menu online before visiting. So let me get into the food yes you're not going to get your traditional Italian pasta plates with a ton of raviolis in red sauce here this is a gourmet light new mix on Italian dishes it  was excellent I would definitely be back again. Oh and the desserts are great you need to try the nipples yes the Venus nipples if you love chocolate those are my favorite. And one more thing my favorite cocktail is the destroyer yes the destroyer definitely try that .",

The food was not worth what they charge.  We got the risotto, which was full of shells.  Our party even got sick from it.  The other dishes like the burrata and the pasta were ok.  Nothing special and nothing that you could not have gotten from olive garden.  I love Giada and was very excited to eat at her restaurant, but it was incredibly disappointing.  In a city with so many high quality restaurants, I recommend that you eat somewhere else.  This place is definitely not worth your money.",

She recommended orzo meatballs and cippolini onions for appetizers and they were fantastic! For entrees I had the tricolore salad and my friend had the tubetti pasta. We loved them both! We wanted espresso after our meal,  the server recommended a delicious treat with espresso, nutella, and whipped cream. It was the perfect ending to a great meal! Thanks, Giada, for helping me show my friend a great time while she was visiting. I will definitely be back with more friends!",

My favorite dish I had was the veal chop saltimbocca. I loved how they stuffed it with fontina cheese and the sauce that it came with was outstanding. And my favorite side was the lemon potatoes. I never have thought that lemon and potatoes go together, but there it is. Amazing! I was told to check this place out and I am very glad I did. The food aside, everything was awesome! Our waiter was fantastic, and even the busser was very knowledgable! The girl that brought our food was super helpful, also! The only thing I didn't like about this whole event is that I cannot give this place more than 5 stars. I think Giada might know what she is doing. Keep up the good work Giada!",

    "text": "We had a lunch reservation for Friday, January 2nd at 1:30 pm, and weren't seated until 2:20! It was a disaster. When we checked in, the hostess at the counter wasn't especially helpful and mentioned that they were running 20 - 25 minutes behind schedule. In their defense, they did bring out complimentary drinks to those waiting, but there wasn't enough seating, and as someone who is 9 months pregnant, it took a LONG time for them to eventually bring out some water. Which was fine (I didn't ask for it, after all), but I thought it a little odd that they weren't more aware of the crowd that was standing around waiting.  When we were finally seated, I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The waitress informed us that the kitchen was extremely backed up, but we told her we had a flight to catch and the food came out in a fairly timely manner. The peppers to start were a little too sweet for my taste (it tasted very citrus-y to me), and my dining companion and I did NOT like the sweet ricotta pizza (with pink peppercorns...it tasted like a spicy dessert). That being said, we both really liked the Venetian panino and would order it again.  The cookies to finish off the meal were delicious.   Overall, I'm disappointed that a manager never made the rounds apologizing for the delay (like most 50-minute delays would warrant) , and that the food wasn't really worth waiting for. Hoping they get these kinks worked out, because the space is really, REALLY beautiful.",

The comments i want to make are about the decor, it doesnt seem to match Giadas persona and the seating arrangements. I dont know her but this restaurant has a \"goth\" feel to it. From the dark decor to the dark dresses the hostesses wear. It's kind of weird. Also, if i you market yourself as a restaurant with an incredible view of the strip , dont seat your patrons in the alcove next to the bar. Especially if i went to the trouble of making a reservation. Im trying to give my wife a fine dining experience not a high priced casual meal. If someone goes through the trouble of  making a  reservation, treat them like someone who is trying to experience what you are marketing. This includes the view. Not all of it but at least a couple of lights.",

    "text": "After several visits with clients, the wife and my escape from yet another bachelor party (see my \"Gold Coast Hotel\" review), below are some quibbles, pointers and comments:  --The delightful risotto with the crab and scallops in the cream sauce needed more than two scallops. --I wanted the chicken marsala meatballs to taste better: They had that Costco chicken patty flavor. More marsala sauce and mushrooms to the mix? Add some ground veal maybe? --The Caesar vinaigrette was a nice change from the \"gorpy\" generic Caesar dressing found at other restaurants. Unfortunately the croutons were stale more than once. --Noisy, noisy, noisy...every time. No intimate dinner with the wife here. On another visit, the last thing the four of us wanted after 10 hours wandering around the stuffy halls of the LVCC was trying to talk over a loud music mix. --Smoky, smoky, smoky. Not from the people around you (common in Las Vegas), but the wood smoke from the kitchen. You come out smoky-smelling, like what you'd get from a 4-day camping trip. --On one visit, I faced the sun setting. Not pleasant when there are no screens or curtains, so watch out where you sit. --The waiters need to bring the bread before the drinks. This happened every time, with one time bread being brought after the salads. Arrgh. The flat bread, the bread sticks and especially the focaccia baked in a clay pot, were excellent. --If you are willing to pay fifty bucks for the veal dish, you've probably been to Italy (even if it was just once after high school), and know how to pronounce the names of the pasta items.  The place has been open for just over a year, and I'd expected a smoother operation by now. Worth another try/chance.",

    "text": "Meh. I've experienced better describes my feelings exactly, especially if I compare my experience at other places in Vegas. My rating is mainly based on the service we received.  I am obsessed with Giada- I have been watching her on TV for years and I was SO EXCITED to try her new restaurant. The first thing I did after our plane tickets were booked was to go online and make dinner reservations here.  The location, ambiance and comfort level of the restaurant was excellent. The hostess gave us a warm and friendly greeting. They were 20 minutes or so late on seating us but the bar area was great and the drink server was super friendly and the hostess made sure to let us know that she had not forgotten about us. So far, so good.  As soon as as we were seated, it was like a switch was flicked. The atmosphere changed to being fun, vibrant and friendly to stressful, busy and rushed. Our waiter took an exceptionally long time to come over to our table and even when he did come, he seemed so busy and stressed that he could not take the time to actually greet us, go over the menu or offer any pleasantries. It felt almost as if we were bothering him because he was in the middle of something.  My mom and my fiance wanted some recommendations on red wine and the waiter sent the somm over. As soon as my fiance said we would be ordering by the glass or half bottle, the somm literally pointed out those sections on the menu (which we had obviously already found ourselves) and then walked away. I wish I was exaggerating or making this up but he literally turned around and walked away and never came back. It made us feel as if we were not good enough for wine recommendations because we were not ordering by the bottle. We told the waiter what happened and how upset we were and he did not offer any type of response and then a few minutes later the two of them were off to the side staring at our table and talking. I wanted to get up and leave at this point but the other people I was with were too hungry.  The rest of the night went the same way- slow service, hard to find our waiter, when he did come over he made the atmosphere feel rushed and unrelaxed and as if we were bothering him.  Now for the food- I would say it was average. If this review was based only on food I would give it 3 or 4 stars. Part of this is because I don't think we fully understood what we were ordering- we ordered one of the flatbreads to start and it was not what we thought it was going to be. I probably would have asked for more help and recommendations but the waiter and especially the somm made us feel so unimportant so we just ordered, ate and left.",

    "text": "In short, excellent for drinks. Disappointing for food.   Ambiance: 5/5. Beautiful venue. Contemporary, chic, yet comfortable.   Service: 3/5 Surprising for a new, high profile restaurant. ( my visit was in October 2014) we were seated about 30 minute after our reservation, which I found surprising. Perhaps it was to encourage us to use the photo booth in the lobby. The photo booth was a nice little touch. The delay in service was less nice.   Drinks: 5/5 I don't remember the names of any but we tried about 4 different signature drinks. every one of them were beautifully executed and delicious.   Food:  -Antipasti platter of Giada's favorites: 4/5 overall good. Well executed, though nothing was mind blowing -Octopus: 5/5 Well executed. Perfectly grilled. Fennel salsa was a great accompaniment.  -Spaghetti(lemon/shrimp/basil): 1/5 This was one of \"Giada's favorites\". the pasta was limp and sticky. sauce was just cream with minimal flavor. sorely disappointed. -Risotto: 2/5 yet another of \"Giada's favorites\". Creamy, yes, but in a heavy heavy sort of way. again, disappointed, though not as bad as the spaghetti.  -Tiramisu: 2/5. not terrible, but when is tiramisu ever terrible? It fell a bit flat for me. it was fine.   So the dinner started out great. The drinks were delicious, the venue was gorgeous, the antipasti was yummy....Then the food was one disappointment after another. I highly doubt I will return for food. Sorry Giada, I wanted to love you but I couldn't...  Oh, one hilarious moment was when their super fancy ipad drink menu froze and they had to reboot, struggle, then it froze again.",

As always the food was good, some dishes like the dates, lemon spaghetti and Parmesan eggplant fries are great. Tonight however the experience was a real drag....you judge. 6.15 reservation, arrived at 6.10 and was told 5 groups were ahead of us..we went to the bar with and ordered wine, martini and dates. Katy was great at the bar it was 6.40 before we were seated for our 615 reservation..it was 7 before our waiter showed up, thank goodness we had brought the bottle of wine from the bar with us. It took another 15 or 20 minutes to get bread. It was 8 yes 8 before our main course (ordered at 7 or 7.05 arrived...again the food was very good. How can there be an excuse at a restaurant, where service is a huge part of the experience, for this kind of delivery. 25 minute delay for seating a 615 reservation..45 minutes past reservation time before seeing the dining room waiter. Excuse of kitchen backed up doesn't feel right. Too many great restaurants in Vegas to put up with this!",

Our server Ron was good but the sommelier needs to be fired! I should have gotten her name but she was useless and not proud of the skills she could shared. The overall hospitality was fair. When I pay the price I did, I expect exceptional service and I can't say that accept for the person who grinded fresh black pepper on our food (see photo). The Chardonnay we shared was good,  Jordan 2012. The artichoke arrenchini was fried excellently but I couldn't find the artichoke.  I take that back I choked on a hard fibrous piece. I had the surf and turf. The filet was excellent but the crab raviolo was hard and I can't say the taste was fishy but there was an unpleasant taste . It was one raviolo and small! The side of broccoli rabe was unacceptable! So much so I told server and they gave us roasted cauliflower as a replacement.  The broccoli rabe was tough and fibrous and over charred.  I am Italian and I guess my expectations are too high. My friend had salmon and enjoyed.  I was curious about the Strata cocktail so I had that for dessert,  it was good! Again for this type of price Scarpetta is far superior and the hospitality is too!",

My hubby got his fav muffuletta w/ arugula salad on the side. He still prefers the thicker sourdough muffuletta version vs. the flatter sandwich less meat. Unfortunately lunch and dinner menu is a lot different. It would be nice to have more pasta options for the lunch menu.

Stephanie the waitress awesome waitress went above and beyond w/ sending us pictures of ourselves as we forgot our iPhones at the hotel",

Didn't plan ahead and make res.. doh!!... but were able to snag seats for 4 at the bar (bonus as we were able to order off the entire menu).  Don't know what happened, but I don't feel like the experience was as exceptional as the first time. Got the lemon spaghetti again but the prawns were a little over cooked. Burrata wasn't as creamy as the first time. Chose some things off the dessert cart and while it was all good, none of it blew me away (which is funny because didn't Giada start in pastry??) The bartender was awesome and made sure we were well taken care of.  The bestie and her man, however, had a great time and enjoyed everything!",

    "text": "Buyer beware! I was really looking forward to dining here after being a Giada fan for a long time but left very disappointed and very questionable I would ever be back. Food and service were extremely subpar especially given the prices. The best part was probably the ambiance -- it is a beautiful space overlooking the Strip. We went for lunch so the sun shining in the dining room was nice.  We started with an order of the olives. They were supposed to be warm as noted on the menu but they were room temperature. Not a good way to start but the complimentary bread (it was like pizza crust) with pesto made up for it.  We ordered: 1. Carbonara pasta -- Probably the worst carbonara I have ever had. They should call is something else because it is nothing like the traditional Roman specialty. Before ordering I asked the server what the carbonara is like, whether it's eggy -- I always do this when ordering carbonara anywhere because so many restaurants butcher this dish -- and she said it's \"very good with only a hint of cream and one of my favorite dishes on the menu.\" So I felt confident it was going to be great. Instead I got one of the smallest portions of pasta I have ever seen (more like an appetizer portion for $24!) that was barely warm in a bland cream sauce with a few specks of bacon or pancetta (there was so little of it I couldn't tell) and onion. Not at all what I had expected so I only had a few bites. 2. Margarita pizza -- Barely any sauce or cheese. Tomatoes were sundried. Came out cold and pretty dry. Definitely not oven fresh. 3. Lasagna -- This was the pasta of the day and definitely the best choice of the three entrees we ordered. That said it was a pretty generic lasagna and nothing special about it. Came with an arugula salad.  After the dishes were served it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to come by to check on us. My husband had finished his pizza by the time the store manager happened to stop by as she was making her rounds. When I told her I was disappointed about my carbonara she immediately took action and the server came over to replace my dish. I asked for the soup instead (minestrone) -- I wanted something quick since everyone else was pretty much done with their meals --  which sadly again, was bland and very disappointing.   To the restaurant's credit they addressed our situation with a lot of apologies and complimentary cookies which were delicious -- peanut butter chocolate, lemon ricotta and chocolate chip. Next time maybe I should skip the main meal and go back just for dessert.",

The knowledge of each product, where it comes from, descriptive phraseology to illustrate how wonderful all he dishes were, even down to the vast knowledge of the vintages of wines available and recommendations were spot on. Each bite was more tantalizing than the last. We started off with the Ricotta crostini and chicken marsala meatballs (to die for) the pea tortellini, and main courses of surf & turf and mustard crusted lamb chops. Those gorgonzola mash were ethereal!  For dessert, we got the chocolate tart at the recommendation of our waiter. This did not disappoint either. If you love reese's (and I do) this is a more mouth-watering version. Delicate, decadent, subtle nuances of flavor coupled with big bold flavors side by side, I can't wait for another reason to go back and try more items!

We ordered three items to share, the lobster roll, the lemon pesto grilled cheese and the arugula salad with grilled chicken. I will say the lemon pesto grilled cheese was very good. If we had had just that, this review would be very different. The grilled chicken on the salad was very dry. The lobster had a fishy taste that was very unappealing. And in addition to that, my sister found a wadded up piece of paper in the lobster. We brought it to the attention of our waiter who concluded it must have been a label of some sort. Although he was apologetic, it didn't seem to be a huge deal to him. We were not offered to have the lobster roll taken off the bill, or offered a complimentary dessert, or really any kind of apology other than the less than sincere original apology. Other than that, it wasn't mentioned again. We spent a lot of money in Giada's for that lunch and it was very disappointing to say the least.",

The manager told me that reservations are pretty much required for dinner but lunch is easier to drop by and eat.  I'm guessing it's because people are sleeping off the prior night's festivities.    First off, the staff is very friendly and attentive.  The tables by the windows have a great view of the strip.  There is a nice lounge area between the tables and the bar.    The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, serving antipasti, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches.  Oh yeah, desert too. :-)   Started off with a glass of red win Sangria.  Very tasty but a little on the expensive side.  First to arrive was very good bread served with an equally tasty pesto.  I had the Wood Roasted Mushrooms for my antipasti.  It was oyster mushrooms with toasted Marcona almonds and ricotta salata.  Very good antipasti.  I really like Marcona Almonds because they are so buttery but I felt the flavor got a little lost in this dish.  Next was the Carbonara pizza.  Basically it was a gourmet Italian breakfast pizza.  It was topped with two fried eggs and prosciutto (I think it was Prosciutto San Daniele), and black pepper.  The dough was not very thick, the prosciutto was flavorful without being too salty, and the yolk running off the sides added to the flavor.  Overall an excellent dish!  I wanted a light desert so I ordered the sorbet and gelato.  My mistake!  It came with a small scoop of each flavor: strawberry sorbet, banana sorbet, chocolate gelato and white chocolate gelato.  The sorbets were light and full of the fruit flavors.  The gelatos were also very flavorful and insanely rich!  The presentations for lunch were pretty straight forward.  I'm guessing dinners plates come out a little more artistically.  I guess I have to come back for dinner and find out.  So make a reservation, come to Vegas, and enjoy!",

We were seated in the way back, which didn't bother me as it was a little quieter and mellow however it was super hot back there. I asked the server for some air and he said they were working on it. Was still hot throughout the meal...that's why I have it 4 stars.  The food is fantastic!!!! I love the tapas menu! We ordered several items from the tapas side as well as homemade pasta. It was so delish!!! The fresh olives are literally the best I've ever had. So fresh the marinade was fantastic! The service was 5 star! If I needed anything someone was there to assist. I loved it. Next time I'd like to sit in the main dining room as the view is fantastic!!!",

They also have a really nice kid's menu. The pizza looked so good, I almost wanted one too.  The highlight of the night for me was the French press coffee. It was so yummy I felt as if I was having dessert.  Salmon was just ok, nothing special. No crispy skin. Scallop was nice, but the risotto was not special and way under done. Finally, the broccoli rabe didn't look like the veggie I was familiar with, though I still liked it. However, it was too salty and too spicy. Not great as a side to my seafood entree.",

My suggestions:  - lobster arancini - clams casino - orzo meatballs - eggplant fries - spaghetti with lemon and shrimp  Their spaghetti is their most famous dish for a reason. I originally thought it was just a marketing ploy but it's really delicious. Pasta is handmade and fresh. Shrimps are the size of mini lobsters but much more tender and less rubbery.   To top it off, our server Greg was amazing and brilliant. He gave some great suggestions and provided excellent service. Also, his memory of the menu and our order was incredible.",

    "text": "A trip to Giada's Las Vegas strip restaurant was one of the reasons for our holiday weekend visit to LV. Due to a schedule mix up and the holiday, we were only able to get here for breakfast.   First, the place is gorgeous, top to bottom, from the entry to the restaurant floor itself, the decor is modern but warm and inviting without being the appearance of trying too hard, just a very pleasant place to eat. Very reflective of the chef herself I think and how she presents herself on her show. There are peekaboo views of some of the best parts of the strip from most of the room, but depending on your seating many of the window front seats have full views of the Bellagio fountain show and Cesar's Palace adding to the entertainment value.   The service was attentive and pleasant from the attractive front desk concierges, to well dressed waiter, we felt very well taken care of. Further nice touches with branded name placemats and napkins, though I wonder how many thousands of \"Giada\" napkins they have budgeted to lose to souvenir hunters in their first year!   But we came for the food, and that should be the bulk of my review. Everything we ate was simply incredible. We ordered the caprese frittata with the prosciutto, and the sunrise waffle. The waffle was light and crispy, really excellent, while the frittata had fresh creamy mozzarella both baked in and in dollops, as well as very tasty heirloom tomatoes, just a really solid offering. We also had the lemon smashed potatoes as a side, these were so very good, I could not eat enough of these. They were sort of Yukon gold fingerling potatoes with cheese, lemon sauce and spices. Really good. Even the sourdough toast came with a plate of well conceived fresh butter, spreads and fresh raspberry jam. The breakfast drink menu, while expensive, offered several interesting choices, the Palm, a pineapple/apple/mint/lemon concoction was delicious.   In short, despite being a very expensive option for breakfast, at nearly $90 for two, the food here is incredibly good, I look forward to trying their dinner menu at some future point. Clearly a lot of thought went into the breakfast menu, which was creative, and very tasty, so I imagine the lunch and dinner menus will be the same. Giada is highly recommended!",

I will not deny I was a tad skeptical when she picked it, I tend to be a bit over critical of European styled restaurants in the US, especially celebrity run ones, mainly because I used to travel all over Europe for business.  I'm even worse if it's Italian!  I apologize for my inner snob coming out there.  Fear not dear reader of this review - you will not be disappointed if you come here.  This place is done with class, it's perfect from the initial greeting, looking up your reservation (and yes make one it's a popular place for good reason), being taken to your table and handed off to your server.  The atmosphere in here is amazing and it has stunning views of the strip. When asked due to bright sunlight they lowered the automatic blinds without complaint.  Now add to that the great table service and wonderful, helpful, relaxed explanation of all the menu items.  Even something as basic as water refills was done in a friendly, conversational manner.  Now after all that, yes, I'll get to the food!  The bread plate up front was nothing short of wonderful.  Now add to this our appetizer of Chicken Marsala Meatballs which were wonderfully, naturally, flavored and so soft and succulent it was the perfect start to our meal.  For our mains we had the Lobster Roll as well as the Tenderloin Sliders and these also were both tantalizing and delicious. The food here just has to be tried.  One final point on the atmosphere here and I'll be done I promise!  It is cosy, inviting and relaxing.  A truly great place for special occasions.",

We arrived at the Cromwell and were greeted at Valet by the nicest Valets I have ever experienced in Vegas. We made our way upstairs to the hostess station at the restaurant and were told our table would be ready in a couple of minutes. To pass the time we went into the photo booth and took some photos to remember the day by. Just as we were done in the photo booth, our table was ready. The restaurant itself is large and very open. It is beautifully decorated with huge movie posters of movies that Dino De Laurentiis produced in his amazing career. Next time we go however we will try to get a seat by the window as it is an amazing view. But enough of the stuff no one cares about, lets get to the food.   We had the wood roasted mushrooms, the baby sweet peppers, the sweet ricotta pizza, and the muffuletta. We loved every single one of them. Basically this was one of the best overall meals I have had in a restaurant in a very long time.   Also the service was great and Giada herself was in the restaurant going to some tables and talking to them. Although we didn't get to meet her we love that she is there talking to her fans.",

When I heard they were redoing Bill's and turning it into a boutique hotel I thought that should be fun I guess. But when I heard they were turning it into a boutique hotel with Giada's first restaurant I though OH EM GEE I have to go!  I finally got to try Giada the other weekend when a Vegas virgin friend of mine decided to visit and thought it would be a perfect opportunity to go. Now the big thing I should stress is: MAKE RESERVATIONS! I called about 3-4 weeks in advance as soon as I knew my friend was visiting and they told me their reservations were already booked for Friday night. However, they managed to squeeze me in by calling the restaurant themselves.   Onto our night. After check-in, there was a fun (and free) photobooth where you can take 3 pics and it prints out a fun photostrip for you as a keepsake! We had been waiting a little bit outside so decided to go to the bar and wait instead. I ordered the Destroyer, which is supposedly one of Giada's personal favorite. It had tequila and I was already sold.   After sipping our libations we were ushered to our table and boy was it a great table. It was a lower level booth that faced the Bellagio fountains and Ballys. Request it if you can, folks. I was digging everything about the table and decor of the restaurant. Very homey yet classy at the same time for a hotel restaurant. Request it if you can, folks.  The food.. you already know if it has Giada's name on it. Our group of 3 shared three appetizers and each had a pasta dish instead of any mains and it was quite a lot of food. My favorites were the bacon-wrapped dates and my pasta dish was her lemon spaghetti. I was able to order it with chicken instead of the shrimp (personal preference). The pasta was not too lemon and a great texture and consistency. The bread 'basket' and butter sides they give you are also to die for. I asked for seconds!  Overall, a simply splendid evening with great food and company. The only thing that could have made it better? Giada herself of course! We were told we JUST missed her from the afternoon :( Giada, invite me back when you are there please!",

Waited at the hostess station to be seated for 5 min - no hostess in sight. When she finally came, we had to wait for a table because we didn't have a reservation. We passed the time in the photo booth (great idea and I give that part 5 stars.) We were seated fairly quickly and the restaurant was mostly empty.   I ordered the lemon basil grilled cheese with prosciutto. The sever brought me a lobster roll. My friends orders were correct and by the time I got what I ordered my friends were half way done. Sandwich was cold and overly lemony. Server did apologize but no offer of compensation or perhaps a dessert.   Service was slow. Really overrated for the prices and I feel like I could have made the sandwich I ordered at home. Nothing special about Giada's.",

Where does the negativity come from you ask? Our first impression with the restaurant - the host stand. We arrived on time for our 1:15 lunch reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready yet, but would be in no more than 30 minutes. Umm? I know it's a new restaurant and they'll surely have kinks to work out, but the concept of reservations, seating guests, and turning over tables isn't new.   Finally get seated after 20 minutes, and we're stuck in a corner at one of those higher bar-type tables. Unfortunately someone in our party doesn't do well in those chairs and we asked to be reseated and were told we'd have to wait again. Ugh.   Luckily they have a fun photo booth to play with, but the wait for the second table was only 5 minutes. Once we were finally seated, everything was top notch. Our table had a view of the fountains, our waiter was great, and the food was phenomenal. We shared the chicken meatballs, lasagna, Waldorf panzanella salad, and a margherita pizza. In fact, the pizza was so good we ordered a second one before gobbling up some zeppole and a tomato and strawberry crostada for dessert.   I'd love to go back and try dinner...hopefully by that time they'll have figured out how to seat people.",

Not pineapple that looked like it was chopped from a can.. :-/    Pizza with egg and prosciutto was awesome. \"Gnocchi\" was a bit misleading and disappointing. It was not the fluffy potato dumplings my husband was expecting. It was gnocchi pasta...basically overpriced  pasta with marinara is what it tasted like. Red sangria was great. Bloody Mary pretty good. Overall great service, very good food for breakfast/lunch. Beautiful views and decor.",

I made reservations, and they set us up on an amazing window seat! She was thrilled!  There were so many tasty options, we decided to go \"family style\" and I am so glad we did! Ordered a bunch of small plates and a couple entree. Everything was made with care and love! SO GOOD!   Have noticed a few other reviews not happy with service. That was NOT our experience at all! And we were there prime time Friday night! From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we were exciting every single staff person we came across was friendly, smiling and warm! Our waiter, Rocco, was incredible! He was so attentive, helpful and friendly!   Now I am excited to try it for breakfast!  My one tip - This place is one of the hottest dining rooms on the strip! Make reservations as much in advance as possible, prime time is filled quickly!",

There wasn't enough food for one never mind two.  Portion size was extremely smalll(size of a cup) l especially for the price they charged.  The taste of the food was also just ok-wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. I have had way better for a lot less.  Do yourself a favor and go to Battista's Hole in the Wall if you want good Italian food in Las Vegas.   Giada' is a typical celebrity chef clip joint. Nothing special.",

I had a great view of the strip at my table. I ordered the risotto. Tho I had no knowledge of the dish I did not like it and never had it. My friend shared her dish of Surf and Turf with me and I Loved it! Not saying don't order the dish I had but know what you are ordering. We also ordered ALL the desserts on the menu and they were all soooooo good. I highly recommend the ice cream, and we had a dish with a raspberry sauce, so delicious. I would most definitely go back.",

I was totally pleased with the food, the service and the atmosphere and it was nice to walk out with a satisfied feeling on all levels. My caprese frittata was wonderful and the added prosciutto was just perfect. The pastry, a quasi croissant with chocolate in the center, was exactly what I had hoped for. The mimosa was a bit pricey, but it IS Vegas, so I didn't view it as objectionable, particularly as it was delightfully refreshing...  As I write this, I am thinking that I need to return one more time before I leave... The only thing which could have made the experience better was had I met Giada herself, ha-ha..",

    "text": "I went to Giada with 3 other girlfriends during a long weekend in Vegas.  We had high hopes for Giada and all started out well, but went downhill from there.  While the surroundings are quite stunning and well thought out, it was a little disturbing that cookbooks and other various items were being hawked at the entrance.  While tastefully done, it is still retail.  The waiter was attentive and nice early on, but then seemed to lose interest in our table.  Not sure of the cause, as we had 2 bottles of wine, appetizers, main courses and dessert.  Thankfully, the dessert cart attendant and water attendant made up in attention what our waiter lacked.  While we all agreed that we would highly recommend the spaghetti with shrimp, the bacon wrapped dates (yum!) and the mushroom Gorgonzola flatbread, my experience with my entree fell flat.  I had ordered the farrotto, which at the time had morel mushrooms as the starring ingredient.  I literally had 2 mushrooms and the farro was completely tasteless.  Not once after we received our food did our waiter come ask us how it tasted.  It was only after all of my friends had finished their meals (mine was still there, with only 2 bites gone) that our waiter came back.  He failed to notice my (uneaten) meal and it was only when my friend pointed out that I was disappointed in my meal did we get a half hearted apology.    We will pass on Giada next time we're there.",

    "text": "I had been to Giada's previously with some girlfriends and really enjoyed it. This experience was VERY disappointing, so much so that I will probably not return. I made reservations for a party of 3 at 9:30pm. We arrived at about 9:20 and were told we should be seated shortly. About 5 minutes after we arrived, a party of 4 arrived. I heard the man tell the hostess he had reservations for 10pm. The hostess told him he could not be seated until closer to his reservation time. He asked if there was anything she could do and gave her CASH (I physically saw him hand it to her and her open up a drawer and put it inside). She then escorted him and the rest of his party to a table for 4 in the dining area. Mind you, this was 9:30pm. CLEARLY she gave him MY table. We were not seated until about 9:45pm. I was LIVID. The waiter was fine, a bit slow. We ordered some appetizers and some pasta dishes. My brothers were not impressed, they thought it was underwhelming and the portion sizes are very small. One brother ordered the tortellini and literally was given 8! The highlight: my dinner - spaghetti and shrimp. IT WAS DELICIOUS! ALMOST made me forget about the disappointment at the hostess stand. All in all, the food was good but overpriced. And even though it's Vegas, I would never allow my restaurant to be run that way. Giada and management should be ashamed and that hostess should be fired.",

    "text": "I had a birthday celebration for my GF here on 9/1/14 ON Labor Day.  I emailed Laurent, the manager for a last minute booking for a party of 12 and amazingly he went above and beyond to not only get us a table on a day that was booked out in every restaurant in LV, but ensured that the entire night was perfect!  If you can request a server, I HIGHLY recommend asking to be sat in Laura's section.  She was wonderful, engaging and made each person at our table feel as if they were the only one that mattered to her.  Giada's is a classic Italian dining out experience.  The meal will take 3-4 hours from start to finish and that's how it's SUPPOSED to be!  It's about enjoying your friends and family and experiencing the food along the way.  If you need to get in and out within an hour for dinner, this is not the place for you.  The food here is simply AMAZING!!!!  We ordered so many different things that this review would take forever to complete.  I can however, embellish a bit on some of the highlights.  Charred Octopus - Cooked to perfection. Great amount of char on the Octopus. I converted 5 people that night who hated Octopus to loving it.  That should be all you need to know :)  Artichoke Soup - Rich and velvety.  You get a mouthful of Artichoke essence in every bite.  And the kicker?  NO BUTTER or CREAM in the soup! YUM!  Crab Risotto with Scallops - SO GOOD!  Rich and creamy without feeling too heavy.  The sweetness of the crab played throughout the dish and the scallops were seared to perfection.  7oz Fillet - Easily the best dish of the night.  Everyone who took a bite needed to just sit back in their chair and savor every morsel.  Seared on the outside wonderfully and moist, tender and juicy in the middle and just the right amount of seasoning.  OMG this is a MUST HAVE DISH for anyone who likes a steak! and for those who don't!  Blackberry Parfait - I can't even describe this. Fruity, sweet, light, not too sweet. The perfect end to a perfect meal.  All in all the staff went above and beyond and the food was absolutely AMAZING!  If you are looking for a great meal, a great experience and have some time and a little money to burn, Giada's should be on your to-do list.  Heck, I even did a cartwheel in front of the restaurant after because I was so happy!",

    "text": "I made a reservation with a week in advance. I've been a fan of Giada for so many years. Unfortunately,  I arrived at the restaurant on November 24th, 2015 at 9:00 pm. The front desk greets you with the same inerest and formality as any Denny's restaurant. Their dressed as if they are going clubbing after work. Anyway, I decided to ignore those big detaills that really threw me off. I mean, that is a $$$$ reaturant, a glass of wine will cost you $14. The minimum you are expecting of a restaurant like that is the best service ever. The hostess sat us down and told us that Diego was going to be our server. Diego arrived at our  table 5 minutes after the hostess sat us down, and started speaking with a very thick Italian accent. He welcomed us with a very unfriendly face and asked us if we wanted any drinks without even bringing any menus or offering the types of drinks available. He proceeded to bring the menus and leave without even explaining the menus or dishes available. Again, same service as Denny's. He came back with water, started pouring it, but my husband's glass was out of his reach from where he was standing at. He started asking my husband with some face signals to pass him the glass to pour water, but my husband really didn't understand what he was saying so he reached for the wine glass and Diego said, no no, the glass for water. (Not even a please). I know for sure that if your server, specially at a high class restaurant needs to pour drinks, he must find the way to reach from your right hand side.  Well, we decided to let that My daughter asked him if they had a menus for drinks besides the wine menu, and he proceeded to grab a tablet and shovel it to our faces to show us the drinks instead of taking the time to give us the list of drinks available. That's exactly the same way I order my drinks at Applebee's. To top home it up, I will never forget Diego's most memorable lines: 'If you are going to order dri is, please make it at once so I don't have to go bankrupt and forth'. I truly hope tha line says it all about the restaurant...",

    "text": "Short and sweet: the food is really good, but it's not worth the money. You're mostly paying for the novelty and celeb chef restaurant experience.   Extensive wine list, sommelier on site, but prepare your checkbook for the wines. Almost all wines are three or four figure prices. You can find a bottle or two for around $70-80 though. I like to share two or three bottles per dinner so that I can start the night with a buzz as opposed to the feeling you get after a coma-inducing meal (re: \"the itis\"), but my budget only allowed for one bottle which was nursed slowly over four courses. The itis ensued.   You can order off of a tapas-style small plate menu or opt for Giada's menu which she offers her house guests. We did Giada's menu which included a shareable antipasti plate, a tiny pasta plate (can be a let-down if you're a big pasta lover like me!), an entree (I did the rack of lamb- amazing), and three mini-desserrts per guest. The cost of this tasting menu is $120/person.  The service, although not bad, did not not match the price. Nothing special about the service, our waitress wasn't extraordinary like the bill. I'm sure this varies server-to-server though.   Important note about how you like your steak cooked: my date ordered the beef tenderloin for her entree, cooked medium-rare. She is not one to send back food, but at this price, you might as well make sure it's right. The steak was rare in our books (red center). She sent it back and they cooked the same steak longer, but not long enough to cook it more. It was simply warmer, the color didn't change. Hesitating and trying not to be an ass, she sent it back again, and they agreed to cook a whole new steak. Third time's a charm: it came medium-rare (to our standards: warm pink center). There seems to be varying definitions of steak done-ness, but what happened with my date can be avoided by communicating to the server exactly how you would like your steak to look. I'm pretty surprised they didn't start a new steak the first time she sent it back and that they didn't cook it enough to add more color.   Would I go back? Yes, but only if I'm rich enough that dropping $1000+ for two ain't no thang. So, no, I wouldn't. (We paid around $500 after tip, and I really wanted more wine. Maybe tapas is the way to go instead.)",

She had a rude attitude and was just plain \"stuck up.\" Here I am, coming to spend big money in a nice restaurant. I feel we should be treated like gold like most good restaurants I've been to; but no, not here. I think Giada would be very disappointed with the treatment we got since she seems sooo nice. When we were finally seated, the water took quite awhile to come. The server was average. This place just seems really overrated. Everything is al-a-carte so you end up spending a lot of money on apps, salads, entrees, ands sides. We ordered the \"whole chicken for 2\" for 58$. When it came out it looked like KFC chicken with four pieces of breasts and a tomato like marinade/sauce in the middle (which was mediocre). By the time the bill came, it was $128. This was without us drinking alcohol and without any dessert! What a joke of a place--very overrated. My wife was so excited to go there. This whole experience was a HUGE let down. Also my wife is a huge fan of Giada so we left a gift for her at the front and again the hostess who took it didn't even say thank you or anything. Again, very rude. They had about 10 hostesses there--is that really how many people you need to greet and seat people? Seems a little excessive if you asked me!  I don't plan on returning here ever again and I'll be sure to let others know not to patron this establishment.",

    "text": "When approaching Giada's, you are rewarded with the smokey aroma of wood burning ovens. This inviting scent rescues you from the abrasive air freshener emanating from the adjoining casino. With a large bank of glass, guests can explore one of the best views in Las Vegas. The scene is fresh, contemporary, and pleasant. The guests range from individuals yearning for a connection to the famous lady, to people ordering endless mimosas...and nothing else...for hours. One can guess how those diners add to the experience. Anyway, let us talk about food. Overall the small plates are classic Giada: simple, fresh, high quality ingredients paired in masterful ways. The ricotta, honey, and pink pepper crostini are superb. Blue cheese filled and bacon wrapped dates are small packets of explosive flavor. Sadly, my dinner lemon spaghetti (Giada signature) delivered moderate flavor and overcooked prawns. The brunch lobster hash served Italian sausage as the kitchen was out of the dish-defining ingredient. The resulting entree could be obtained in any eatery, on any corner. The best element of brunch involved an extraordinary Pecorino Tartufo with apricot preserve. These were two extraordinary and flavorful ingredients simply served. When it came to an item being cooked in the restaurant, the quality lessened. Thankfully, I was able to purchase signed copies of cookbooks. As someone who uses Giada's recipes almost daily, I look forward to exploring her creations based out of my kitchen instead of the one in Las Vegas. As a member of the culinary community, I am rooting for the eatery and wishing all the best. Side note: the mixed cocktails are outstanding here. In my opinion, the best Vegas has to offer: creative, fresh, delicious.",

We did request a table by the window or a booth and we were gratefully accommodated with a booth.  We had the risotto, spaghetti, and the orzo meat balls.  The food was outstanding, but what truly made the meal was our service.  The waiter was very attentive and made us feel very welcome throughout the night.  Lastly I also did have an old fashion and it was one of the best I have had in my life.  Nicely done.",

Right away you are given an assortment of breads, crackers and spreads-another nice touch. Food was very good. I would go back to this restaurant. Reservation is highly recommended.",

Expected slightly more interesting flavor from a celebrity chef and really didn't appreciate the server recommending we order pasta as a starter because the portions were small.  We were full before we started and left with regaret that we wasted so much food.",

    "text": "Like another review said, lower your expectations. The food was absolutely incredible. There's a wide variety of choices on the antipasti menu and we thoroughly enjoyed about 5 out of the 6 we ordered. The lemon spaghetti was out of this world. I regret not trying a dessert, everything looked amazing. I knocked off two stars solely for the service. The hostesses were cold and unwelcoming and our server was clueless. We were seated about 30 minutes after our original reservation. The moment we sat down, our server wanted to get us out the door. She was pushy and attempted to rush us through our meal. She also failed to refill water glasses, clear plates when new dishes came out, just those small things you never really think about  until it happens. I would go back again, but perhaps try to be seated at the bar to avoid the poor service.",

    "text": "We made a reservation about 1 month in advance for our dinner at Giada's. My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and my mother joined us for our meal (her treat which was awesome). Our seating time was @5:15, and we arrived a few mins early so we stood and looked at the different pictures and such on the walls before being seated. We were given a tour of the stations and explained what each person was doing. We were seated in the corner, kind of like a little private space, it was really nice. The windows were shut and blinds pulled because the sun just pounds that space from about 5:00-7:00. Once 7:00 hit, they raised the shades so you could look outside. Upon being seated, we were greeted by our server who was very very very knowledgeable about everything. He showed us the I-pad with the drinks and such. Also, we had a lady who would fill our waters and give new plates and such for courses. She was so kind, we warned her we were extremely thirsty as we had played tennis at The Cosmo that day and she sure made her promise of never leaving us with an empty water glass. The general manager also came by to introduce us and to wish us a happy anniversary.   We choose the following 3 drinks to kind of \"share\" and \"try\"........  #1 Hannibal: Botran Reserve Rum, Maurin Quina, fresh lime, blood orange and mint syrup, Chianti float. It was served in a giant goblet glass with crushed ice. The Chianti float was served in a lime turned inside out.   #2 La Strada: Campari, homemade lemon sorbeto, Bertagnolli Limoncello, Proseco. This was the lightest of the drinks. Very refreshing.  #3 The Destroyer (Conan the Destroyer) Clase Azul Tequila Reposado, fresh tangerine, orange and basil, basil ice sphere. This was the strongest and my husbands favorite.   We then choose 3 apps to share:  #1 Wood Roasted Mushrooms w/ toasted marcona almonds & ricotta salata. Very good, great assortment of different mushrooms.  #2 *Rollatini - ricotta stuffed Eggplant & pomodoro. Very small but very good.  #3 Calabrese, spicy calabrian chili, the original pepperoni, pork. When ordered, this was my least favorite but ended up being very very good.  #4 (just my husband) Pasta e Fagioli w/ creste di gallo, cannellini & parmigiano-reggiano (soup)  My husband and mother shared the assortment of breads and breadsticks as I cannot eat them because of wheat allergy. They were very kind in asking if it was ok if they brought the bread out as I could not have it.   We then choose 2 pasta courses to share. I am gluten free, so the knowledge the server had about it was wonderful.   #1 *Spaghetti (Spah-geh-tee) shrimp, lemon & basil made with their house made gluten free pasta. It was excellent. I always get worried ordering gluten free pasta as its usually just an afterthought. The server assured me that Giada would not put something on the menu she was not confident was the best. Let me tell you this was the best gluten free pasta I have ever had. I could tell the time and perfection that went into it. That night, the gluten free pasta was a bucatini.   #2 Risotto (ree-ZOHT-oh) crab & scallops. The scallops were amazing. I could of eaten a meal just on that. Risotto perfectly cooked.   We then choose 2 mains to share. Honestly, if I went again, I would just order more apps and pasta courses and skip mains. Don't get me wrong, the mains were very good but I just really loved the apps and pastas.  #1 Branzino, w/ tangerine vinaigrette. Very good and very fresh.   #2 Whole Roasted Chicken for two, cacciatore style. Beautiful presentation before actually cutting it up and serving. Chicken had a spicy rub and the sauce made from the veggies roasted with the chicken were good.   All night we watched this poor desert guy push his cart around trying to not to take people out. Its a cool idea but really seems like it gets in the way. His cart was parked by us and they switched the cookies out 3 times during our 2 hours. Kind of seems like a waste, I hope they give those cookies to the food pantry or something. They presented us with a plate that said happy anniversary written in chocolate and we choose a very good strawberry sorbet to share.   All in all I would say Giada's was a wonderful experience and one I will never forget. It was a very beautiful place and classy yet I never felt out of place. It still had a very casual feel and I love how they encourage you to share with your group. It really makes dining fun and allows you try new things. We all decided this would have to be added to our yearly trip each year.",

    "text": "My husband took me here for my birthday since I am a huge Giada fan. We did the tasting menu for dinner and everything was DELICIOUS! My favorite part was the dessert:). They brought me out two cookies for my birthday THEN we both got to pick 3 items off the dessert tray. The polenta cake and the lemon cookie were my favorite. We had such great service from the sommelier and our server Cliff. The bottle of wine he chose for us paired perfectly with everything we ate ( Tignanello). I chose the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and lamb chops for my meal and they were both out of this world. Since we had already eaten the delicious bread tray and antipasto platter I was stuffed by the time the lamb chops came. Next time I will try not to fill up on the fabulous rosemary bread. We also had a great view of the strip and could see the Bellagio water fountain from our table. I love you Giada!! Please open a restaurant on Dallas!:)",
