Overall the standard fare is good and stick to the basics of a bar and grill type of food and you're good for a good meal.  Yes you're still in the hotel so it is going to cost you, I had a nice big meal-size salad and it was enough for a good lunch.  I sat at the bar and a very friendly bar tender kept my ice tea filled up the whole time.",

Buttery, thick, shale-like layers with a generous amount of raspberry filling and crumbles on top. The banana chip muffin was okay, but the chips were interesting in that they melted at the slightest touch. If I blew on it, three chips disinegrated immediately!   When I asked for the banana chip muffin, they accidentally gave me banana bread, and when I went back to the counter to exchange it, they told me to keep it so I gave it to my homie who said it was the best thing of the 5 things we got.   With so many other bakery options on the Strip, I wouldn't make a special trip here, but it was nice that they had counter seating available for snackers like us :)",

They should call the dish \"Brown Rice with a few veggies\".   The salmon was cooked well which made me bump them up from 1 star to 2 stars.  Add a sparkling water, tax and tip, I ended up paying $46.  Definitely not worth even half the price tag.   The second meal was breakfast.  The coffee was good but I didn't get further than that.  They were out of oatmeal which is the only thing on the menu you can eat if you are gluten-free and can't have eggs.  My suggestion is they pop of gluten-free bread in their freezer so people have some more options.  Also, swap real maple syrup for the fake stuff.  It's all just a reminder that high prices don't equal high quality.",

The service was slow, the place was noisy, my bar stool got bumped twenty times by patrons, buses and waiters but damn what a sandwich. Everything about it was so damn good!

Our waiter Giddeon, was amazing, he helped us with the choices on the menu and got our food out quickly and correctly.  I ordered a veggie bowl which contained rice, veggies and pieces of steak.  It was acceptable, but I wouldn't recommend it as one of their best dishes.  My coworkers had lasagna and the Citizens prime rib dinner.  Both are huge portions and both were delicious! I should've gone with one of those selections!  The lasagna was nice and tasty with a great short rib bolognese sauce, served with garlic toast, simply delicious.  The prime rib looked amazing, although I did not try it, the broccoli was nice and crunchy, cooked to perfection.  The steak fries were to die for.  Went back the next day and had the turkey avocado sandwich- exceptional! huge portion- was only able to eat half, but it was simply delicious served on cranberry bread. The mixture of the aioli and the sweetness of the bread was perfect.  My coworker order the mahi mahi fish tacos, I think it was 3 tacos to the order, they were a good size, served with fries, also very good.  I highly recommend this place and their service.",

Note: the evening menu does change and doesn't provide a lot of options. I ordered a cheese quesadilla which was yummy and fresh, but something I could make at home.   We ate there for dinner and the crispy shrimp On the appetizer menu was so delicious! I'd go back just to order that. We also had the Mac and cheese, which was tasty, but comparable to other places. We also had the spinach dip and mashed potatoes which I wouldn't order again. Tasteless and the spinach dip said it had artichoke, but the pieces were so small and infrequent I can't even consider it to have artichoke.   Service both times was mediocre. My opinion: go there when all other options are exhausted. And thanks Citizens for staying open for the drunk people!",

We showed up as they were transitioning from breakfast to lunch, but no worries, they still sat us down and gave us some chips and pico de gallo to munch on while we waited for the kitchen to shift. The pico was basic, but this isn't the type of restaurant to serve something more elaborate. We ate it all up without complaint.   For lunch, we both ordered a reuben with corned beef and fries.  Service was prompt at this point. Our sandwiches had nicely toasted bread, an inch or so of juicy corned beef, melty cheese, and a nice layer of sauerkraut.  No complaints from other of us.  We both enjoyed our meals and ate up most of the fries.    My only complaint on this otherwise standard satisfactory establishment is that it is a bit pricy. It's Vegas though, so expect to pay a bit more for everything.",

Like many new restaurants at the higher end casinos, the interior is re-done and has an upscale feel.  Service here was fantastic--our server was very accomodating to our unusual requests, and he was speedy.  How was the food?  Hmmm... I ordered one of their signature items: the meatball grinder (meatball, gravy, and provolone sandwich).  It was missing something... I would start with a thicker gravy with some added punch.  In any case, I got the feeling their recipe was missing a key ingredient(s) and was real close to being perfect--meatballs had decent flavor, lots of provolone, and good, soft bread...  Pic is posted here <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizens-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=iw_BaDqhZdKca8szDQyqhw#4dzx70lU6_dOxSRCHlBerg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/citi...</a>  Another member of our party had ordered the Muffaletta.  I think I'm just not a muffaletta person as the sandwich didn't connect with me.  Visually, it did look good though...  With both sandwiches failing to wow me, great service and good decor isn't enough to woo a return visit from me... =(",

The first night we ordered the BBQ Ribs, the Truffle Cream Prosciutto Penne Pasta w/ Chicken, and Mac N Cheese.     The BBQ ribs came at a full rack, there was so much food that it's hard to complain about but the BBQ sauce was just overwhelming with hotness and spice that I had to take some of it off the meat.    The truffle pasta was REALLY good.  The really strong truffle scent could be smelled through the carryout tray and bag.  Each bite was so delicious.  This was really good that I had to get it again the next day.  What I found though was the consistency of the ingredients was off.  The second time I ordered this, there was far less prosciutto in the dish.  The chicken was  fine though and there were also peas which gave the pasta some color.    The Mac N Cheese was pretty good too.  Mixed w/ ham and peas and crunchy bread crumbs on top, it was a good side dish.  While the food was not bad, the price was astronomical.  The pasta, for example, was $30 w/ chicken.   While it was enough pasta to probably feed two people, I can't help but feel bad afterwards for spending that much on one pasta in a place that's not really 'fancy'.  Of course, this is the Strip we're talking about.  So while staying at the Mandalay Bay, I suppose I'd go here again.  Otherwise, not making my way through the parking lot and crowd for this.",

The servers were very polite, although when we went up to the counter beforehand the hostess was asleep and we stood there awkwardly until she woke up and noticed us.   However the biggest blow was that we'd only gone for the Egg Benedict that was disingenuously advertised as a brunch menu item available all day. However, the waitress told us it was only a breakfast item that they stop serving around 10. In my opinion, brunch is usually something you expect in the afternoon as well.  So two stars for the food, one star for the politeness of the servers.",

Definitely go see Shanna at Citizen!",

She waited on us for breakfast during Interbike 2016 and was so good that we returned to the restaurant the next morning and asked for her. She was cheerful, helpful and extremely efficient. She didn't even write anything down but got all of our orders perfectly. Marjorie Rugg - you have a great waitress in Teasha and we hope to see her again next September while we are attending Interbike 2017.",

Saturday afternoon -- half empty.  We came in and were seated.  15 mins to take our order.  AFTER we ordered another group of four was seated, order taken, and food arrived for them before we were served -- our order was not complicated.  Order came wrong -- asked for cole slaw and got fries.  Other party paid and were gone before we got our check.  Never saw the waiter until we asked for him.  Two simple taco plates, two cups of soup, one club sandwich and four soda = $94.00 (minus tip which I did not leave).    Walk down the Strip a little and get something more reasonable.",

I had the chicken chilaquiles, super cheesy and a little spicy. The highlight for me was the most perfect Bloody Mary, they have the option of bottomless Bloody Marys but you have to hook them up yourself, I opted to have the bartender make mine and it was delish. My husband had the bacon burger and he loved it. The service was on point, everyone was asking how we were doing not just our server. Seriously loved this place!!",

On several occasions the manager working named Margaret or Marjorie (not sure but she works morning and afternoon) has been extremely rude and unfriendly. She doesn't smile or make eye contact with anyone and looks miserable. It's very sad to see someone dislike their job as much as she does and I'm sure her employees pick up on it. Hire someone friendly they are supposed to turn around bad experiences not create them.",

This was a good choice and their food is very generously portioned.   We started with a couple of their signature cocktails. Those were pretty weak and pricey for what you get, not really worth the price and not as delicious as the name and description made them out to be.  For food got the tots and mac n cheese and the french dip. The tots is a huge portion covered in cheese sauce. It was good but I think it could use a little more seasoning. The mac n cheese was flavorful but the crispy topping was bland and didn't add anything to the dish. My french dip was just OK, the saving grace was the dip which was super flavorful and delicious. I was dipping everything from the tots to the sandwich into it.   We came at off hour so it was not busy and service was quick and prompt. Would come back for a quick bite next time we are at Mandalay.",

We ordered a second round Queso and chips: the dip was very tasty and not too spicy. However, the chips were stale. We asked our waiter to bring fresh ones, and the 2nd batch was not much better.  French dip: overflowing with meat and caramelized onions, used a knife and fork. Very tasty, recommend for sure.  BBQ salad: typical salad. Didn't have much dressing, but didn't really need it. The toppings were tasty.   Would we come back again: for sure",

It took on call to the front desk and two calls to the restaurant before the issue was fixed.   Sadly the restaurant manager didn't seem supposed by the fraud that had occurred.",

    "text": "Citizens is not inexpensive (it's in a Vegas hotel, after all), and its not the quickest, but we ate there four times over a 4-day stay. We really enjoyed the food.  It took us a few minutes to figure out that the long line at breakfast was for take-out. Look for the shorter line...with a podium...if you want to sit down and be served. My favorite meal was when I ordered a plain two-egg breakfast. My over-medium eggs were done perfectly. Bacon was beautifully crispy. Potatoes were browned just like I like them. A short stack of delicious, small blueberry pancakes was included. Having had no dinner the previous night, I didn't hesitate to dig in...and almost finished it all.  I can't say the same for subsequent meals.  The portions are ridiculously huge. Wastefully so. Next time we go, we will keep sharing in mind. I loved the Creme Brulee French Toast. It was delectable and included a generous portion of fruit garnish.  I was able to finish about half of it.  Same thing for my BLT with Avocado.  There was so much bacon I couldn't get it in my mouth!  After I ditched maybe half the bacon, I was able to enjoy around 3/4 of the remaining sandwich.  The fries that came with it were the best!  Among our meals, the only real disappointment was the full order of pancakes.  They were much less fluffy than the small ones served with my eggs. They just weren't quite as good. They contained lots of blueberries, so I ate the blueberry islands and forgot the rest.  Again...terribly wasteful. But pretty tasty.  Oh...almost forgot. They serve LaVazza coffee. My favorite!",

My coffee came quickly, but unfortunately I had to ask several times for a refill - a huge pet peeve.  I selected the corned beef hash served with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sans the sauce. I prefer Tobasco. The hash was quite good and the eggs were perfectly prepared. The portion was just right and I left feeling full and satisfied, albeit a tad under-caffienated.  All-in-all I enjoyed my breakfast and would dine here again, but I wish the service had been more attentive.",

We wandered through our hotel looking to see what was open and had a menu of lighter fare and found Citizens. They could seat us right away so we went for it.  The service was horrific. Slow, and when our waiter did show up he was so quiet you could barely hear him and anything we did understand, he was a but rude. We ordered our sandwiches, soups, pastas, etc. and he disappeared. Drinks were barely filled and it took ages to get our food.  Once we actually got our food, it was nothing to write home about - although my club-like sandwich was huge. However, it was so dry it was very hard to get through. My pasta salad was pretty decent, but not really what you want to be excited about when you order a sandwich.   This is definitely on my list to avoid in the future - I'd probably have to be desperate to eat here again.  Pretty disappointing since it seemed like it should have been a good experience.",

Food: Portions are large and for the price it is a pretty good value.   Teriyaki salmon bowl:  filling, but the salmon portion was very small compared to the huge amount of brown rice. BLT sandwich: Tons of bacon and my friend said it was very tasty. Fish and Chips- the piece of fish is enormous and my friend really enjoyed the dish. The fries here are delicious and they have a good wine/beer list.  Customer Service: very friendly and accommodating.  They were easily able to split checks for us.  Overall I would not go out of my way to eat here as there are multiple restaurants in all the Las Vegas hotels that are very comparable.

My wife usually goes for the eggs benedict and she enjoys it - she gives them a 4/5 (and she eats them just about everywhere).  I've had a number of different breakfast dishes and find them to be good, but not any better than anywhere else.    I find the service to be very inconsistent however.  Like others have written when they are busy service can be really slow (I know it's difficult when it is busy - but this is Vegas and you know weekends will be extremely busy - you should plan around that).  So if it looks busy and you're in a rush you might want to avoid this place.   The weird part is that even when they're not busy service is hit and miss.  Most recently they couldn't get our order straight.  My wife was offered fruit or hash browns with her meal - she ended up being given both (although it looked like a half order of each).  I asked for bacon with mine and ended up with ham.  They fixed it all and no problem but she wrote our order down and it wasn't busy... How do you mess that up?",

The first time we went, we stopped for lunch and sat on the patio. My coworker ordered a burger and asked for no onions on it. I ordered the fish tacos. We waited a good 25 minutes for our food, which is an eternity in lunch hour time, and the restaurant wasn't even close to full. When our food arrived, my coworkers burger had onions on it. He stated this to the waitress and she just gave him a dead stare and then walked off. He picked them off, and said the rest of the burger was ok.   The fish tacos were itty bitty. I was confused and wondered if I had accidentally ordered off the appetizer menu, but nope....they were listed as one of the lunch specialities of the place. The three tiniest fish tacos of my life were not worth the $24 price tag attached to them, especially since my only \"sides\" were tiny cups of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole to put on the tiny tacos. If, after spending $24 on three tacos I have to stop somewhere else to get something to eat so I don't pass out from hunger by 2:00, we have a problem. Our waitress ignored us, and we had to ask for every single drink refill we got.   I was ready to boycott the place for life, but my coworker is a more kind and forgiving soul than I am (or a glutton for punishment), so we went back for breakfast a couple of days later. We each ordered an omelet. My coworker asked for no guacamole on his....and they messed up his order.....again. I ordered a denver omelet and washed it down with some of the worst coffee of my life (which was $4...yes, for a cup of black coffee.....yes, you read that right).   My coworker bought both of these meals, and I can't say I would ever come back, even if the food was being paid for by someone else. I am giving the place two stars because the decor inside is nice and the fish tacos (all six bites of 'em) were tasty. Otherwise, this place would be a solid one star.",

    "text": "Located in the Mandalay Ba, my and my 6 friends walked around to find something substantial to eat. After looking at the outrageous prices at some of the other restaurants we decided on eating here as it wasn't crowded at 1pm on Saturday afternoon. Average price of a meal was somewhere between $10-16 and they had a very quick moving to go line.  Came here on a sat around 1:30 with 6 people, 5 min wait to be seated. The food was a different story. Ray was our server. He was so sweet but we waited over 30min for our food even though the restaurant was less than 1/2 full.  As my friend said: \"this is the quintessential restaurant that needs to serve bread or chips.\" The waiting time was horrible as everyone in the restaurant can see the kitchen and see the food being lined up and just waiting to come to the table.  We ordered fish tacos, loco moco and frisco melt. 1)Fish tacos came with 3 tacos and all the fixings: gauc, salsa and sour cream 2)Locomoco was a substantial size but pretty pricey for 17$ and IT IS NOT A BURGER. it is literally rice served with a hamburger patty and gravy and an egg overeasy. Really not sure why it is listed under the burger section 3) 2 of us order the FRISCO MELT: totally bomb and the price of 16$ on the strip was great. Melty melty cheese with sourdough bread and fried onions served with mayo and ketchup and French fries on the side.  Mouth already watering even just thinking about it. Great meal for a pre-drinking night on the strip. Would come here again. Price was reasonably and food was good. Service a totally different story.   The funniest part of this place is that the atmosphere music was that CD \"That what I call music\" circa 1999",

I expressed concerns about the wait time to the manager on duty Amanda who instead of apologizing for the wait said the ticket was dinner in 20 minutes. It might have been printed in 20 minutes but that's not when I ordered my meal. My daughter's volleyball team was seated next to ours and they ordered and finished eating their meals and or food had not come out. I can appreciate a place being busy. What I can't appreciate is the look that this manager gave me when I told her the eggs were not over easy. She wasn't too concerned about improving my experience. The pancakes were very blonde looking and tasted like rubber. There are many other places to eat in Vegas go head over there. I should have went to Hash House. Lesson learned. I wish this place was better.",

If you are on the Strip, you're going to pay twice any amount for that sandwich. Get over it. I ordered the tarragon chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the turkey and avocado on wheat instead of whichever roll they had listed on the menu. The staff was happy to accommodate to our requests and were more than friendly. My sandwich was out of this world delicious. The bread was so surprisingly delightful. Crusty, but with a soft pillowy center. One sandwich was nearly more than enough for me. The boyfriend and I usually order two things and trade halves. His turkey/avocado sandwich was exactly what he was looking for and made to satisfaction. It wasn't anything that lifted my eyebrows but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. All good here if you're just looking for a quick sandwich.",

I asked if they could just bring out another side of hot hash browns and that's exactly what I got. My second plate of hash browns tasted like rubbery overheated hash. What do you expect if it came out a few mid later. Despite the reviews we gave it shot and the reviews were right, sadly. I mentioned to the waitress that my eggs were suppose to be runny and dripping yolk over my toast and all she could do was apologize. The manager on shift was snooty when she came over to our table. She asked why we didn't enjoy our food and asked if we would like another dish but had an unfriendly demeanor. We felt really awkward and just wanted to leave.

The food is pretty typical of what you get in Vegas prep aired to an average standard at an inflated price. The staff is also pretty typical Vegas, lacK of experience with a pulse. I often dine alone since my trips are for business. I work for one of the shows out here so I am always around the building. The often blank stare no personality hostess is put off by having to seat one and will always try and get you to sit at the bar. The bar with its uncomfortable foo foo hard plastic bar stools is always loud due to its hard tile surfaces. The service is unpredictable depending on who is working at the bar. The take out can be a good option but it's take it as it is. Pre made and don,t ask for it any other way. Once again young no personality who gives a shit attitude. Even Burger King will give it to you your way if you ask at a fraction of the price. They are open all the time which is a plus since I often finish working late.",

It's conveniently across from The Light Nightclub which is the whole reason why we even ate there in the first place.  For starters, the service is grand! I had a great time cracking jokes with our waiter as well as for some of the other staff. They're extremely helpful and always try to guide you in the right direction. The food was averagely priced and not bad at all. The wait time wasn't that bad either but that was probably because we were there an hr before closing time.  I enjoyed the salad I chose as well as the drinks they stirred up for me. The rest of my group really enjoyed their burgers here too. I think knowing that this restaurant exists will better my future stays at the Mandalay Bay.  I'm looking forward to see what other tasty meals I'll have here.",

They told us it cost $1.00 each, which really set me back because at least in California, charging for tap water is illegal.  I was raising that concern to my friend until the cashier barked at us \"SINCE YOU GUYS ARE MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS, JUST TAKE THE WATER AND DON'T PAY. IT'S FREE\".  Incredibly rude.  I tried to not overreact and ignored her flagrant unprofessionalism, and proceeded to sit down to eat my sandwich.  As my friend was about to sit next to me, she yelled at us \"YOU CAN'T SIT THERE, YOU HAVE TO SIT OUTSIDE AT THE PATIO\".  I looked around to see if the indoor tables were closed or something, but there were a bunch of people sitting around us.  I then realized that this was some sort of punishment for complaining about the water surcharge.  What the hell.  If I wasn't so tired and hungry, I would've raised hell.  I guess that's what Yelp is for.",

The decor is nice and casual with a pretty open floor plan. There are big windows that allow you to people watch while you eat. We went there twice because they are the only place open 24 hrs. Before the club I had the chicken penne. The penne was cooked perfectly but the sauce to pasta ratio was way off, the penne was swimming. After the club I had the fish and chips. The cod is nice and large but its the breading that killed the dish for me. The cod was beer battered but there was so much beer in the batter, it made my fish taste like fried bud light. Way too over powering to finish not even hot sauce could save it. Id go back if in Vegas again but I would just try my luck with other items.",

It was a nice presentation. The sandwich was easy to eat too, it didn't fall apart when I picked it up. It came on sliced cranberry walnut bread that had a good texture and flavor. I could only finish half of it. The other half was my breakfast the next day. I also got a good bloody mary, nicely spiced. Service was good. The interior was too noisy for my taste, between the high ceilings and tiled floors, so we ate in the sidewalk cafe section. That's a better place to watch people anyway, and half the fun of coming to Las Vegas. Good bargain for the money. I recommend it!",

The place is pretty big and I went to the bar since I was alone, as a friend I was with could not handle Las Vegas :-)  I was served by the bartender Lizzy. I had just come off a pretty wild night so I was not looking for an all booze drink, but something tasty and classy for breakfast. Lizzie made me a double chocolate espresso martini. She used a rye based vodka which was very good.   For breakfast food, I ordered off of their Sunday brunch menu and had a French Toast Creme <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxn--brul-epa.it&s=1c65ad199a5f66674ef59744f57d62fe2b2ebb0f74b00a0ed1637da46f0492c2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brule.it</a> was pretty good tasting and I would recommend it if you are here for a breakfast item.  I had a second drink which is also very good. The bartender was extremely attentive and professional and fun! The atmosphere is also very fun there with seating options in a dining room or the bar. There appears to be a 24 hour cafe as well located in the restaurant.  I highly recommend the place and do suggest you visit the bar when you are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Truly a 3-star restaurant. Citizens has a down to earth vibe that reminds you of a Classic American diner...until you see the $4 price for a cup of coffee. But then again, you're not really in America, you're in Vegas.   Unlike other Mandalay spots, this is a good spot if you know how to order. The $8 side of eggs during brunch is RIDICULOUS. Don't do it. Interestingly, the $2 side of toast is worth it: two slices so large they are a breakfast in themselves. My regular way to start the day at a Vegas trade show at Mandalay is with the chocolate peanut butter smoothie ($9) and that side of toast ($2). For $11, it's a great starter to an intense day on your feet.   And speaking of being on your feet, the floors in Mandalay leading into Citizens are crazy slippery. I'm shocked people aren't breaking their hips on a regular basis. I ate at Citizens twice this week while in town for the Project trade show and nearly fell over another guest waiting in line for a table.   The service at Citizens definitely makes up for the overpriced menu. Servers are cheery but not cheesy and just conversational enough. Not bad, but really overpriced (isn't everything in Vegas), so definitely NOT great.",

    "text": "We met with our out of town friend after her day at a convention yesterday and decided to try out Citizens Kitchen & Bar.  My husband and I split the Fish & Chips and my friend got a cheeseburger with no bun.  We all had fries.  Not the healthiest of meals but we were all hungry and looking forward to a quiet place to sit and catch up.  My husband is a fast eater and got through his food fast and within 1/2 an hour, was in the bathroom.  We left earlier then planned as he was not feeling well.  My friend managed to get back to her room before her stomach started bothering her and I made it home.  All night & morning, we all had diahhrea and stomach issues.  I called them in the morning and asked to speak to a manager to let them know what happened so maybe others wouldn't get sick.  I got a snotty, arogant manager who told me they hadn't had any other complaints and since we didn't all eat the same food, it couldn't possibly be food poisoning.  I told her we all had something fried so maybe there was an issue with their fryers and they should look into it.  She said OK - and hung up on me.  What great customer service!    We spend $70 on 2 meals & 2 sodas and ended up sick as dogs and we basically got - nope, didn't happen, don't care - see you.  Mind you I know their mentality - these people won't be back and we won't have to worry about it again although I did start the conversation letting her know we were locals but that didn't even seem to matter - and it shouldn't - bad food or service should not be for anyone, local or tourists.  But we will definately not be going there again and I will let everyone know what happened so they don't have to experience it themselves.  All of this could have been resolved with a little bit of compasion - it wasn't like I was asking for a free meal or anything - just for them to acknowledge and do something so no one else would get sick.  It might have been a one off but I won't recommend it to anyone - if management doesn't care, why should their employees?",

A co-worker and I stopped by around 2 am after a party to grab a bite to eat before heading to our rooms for the night. Citizen at least has that going for them - They were one of the only places serving food at 2am on a Tuesday night in Mandalay Bay!  I ordered a Bacon Burger ($18) and a Titos and Soda ($14) and she ordered a breakfast burrito. Drinks are generous with a good amount of alcohol in it. My burger, on the other hand, was dry and came without bacon (on a bacon burger... Makes sense right?) If you want any cheese on it that will cost you an extra $2 as well. Fries were good, but a bit over fried.   Their main menu looked good, so I would stop by again to try the daytime chef and see if it's any better. Maybe they are hoping that the late night crowd won't care if they don't make their food right? Either way, it wasn't a total hit or a total miss. Just kind of blah.",

My buddy got the steak frites, which interestingly enough, was not the proper execution of that dish.  Decent drinks menu, but a lot of the beers are served in cans. They might give you a glass to pour it in if you ask.   Service was friendly and well-organized.",

    "text": "Many of the restaurants inside Mandalay Bay are on the pricier end, but Citizens offered an eye-catching Prime Rib dinner deal served with broccoli, salad, baked potato and glass of house wine. All of this for $49 per person!  We saw this as quite a bargain, especially considering that the glass of wine costs about $10 by itself.   The hostess told us at the door that the prime rib would be 8 ounces, but it turned out to be a whopping 14!  Our waiter laughed with us as our jaws dropped when the entrees arrived. (He was friendly and provided great service throughout our meal.)  Wow, I've never eaten so much beef in one sitting. It was cooked to a perfect medium as requested, but could have used a bit more seasoning and the quality of the meat wasn't that great. It had a somewhat grainy texture. Considering the price of the dinner deal though, we couldn't expect the best cut of beef. For something more top notch, StripSteak is down the hall, but at much steeper prices of course. You get what you pay for! As for the side items, our portions of Caesar salad were generous, crisp and fresh. The baked potato was huge, topped with cheese, sour cream and some chives, but was still unfortunately dry and starchy inside as opposed to being fluffy.  If you order this dinner special, make sure to come hungry!   Citizens is open 24 hours and serves typical American fare day and night. Peering around at neighboring tables, their burgers and fries looked delicious so I'd recommend just based on appearance! The main restaurant is sit-down, but they also have a deli section for ordering items like sandwiches, salads and desserts at the counter to grab and go.   3.5 stars.",

While it doesn't have the cobb-cornerstone of avocado, it was delicious nonetheless.  The ingredients are all very fresh & sitting pretty on a crisp bed of iceberg lettuce. I like that the egg whites & yolks are chopped and topped separately, in case you want more of one than the other.  The check-in deal is a slice of cheesecake! I was feeling stuffed from the cobb, but my server happily boxed it to-go.",

We were seated in the back and the environment was dark and somewhat dreary; actually the entire Mandalay Bay hotel is dark and somewhat uninviting. Our waitress was quick to get our drinks and our order, and the food came out in a timely fashion.   First out was chicken noodle soup with \"butter crackers\"...the soup was good but nothing special and the butter crackers that were cleverly worded on the menu were simply saltines with a slab of butter plastered in the middle...sort of strange. Next came our salads; we got the bbq chicken and the cobb that were both significant in size. They were ok, but nothing special. While our waitress was attentive neither she or any of the staff seemed very happy to be working there. The experience was underwhelming all around. There are lots of fantastic places to eat on the strip, I suggest skipping this joint and finding a better option for your tastebuds.",

I was greeted by the hostess and asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or wait for a table. I went ahead and chose the bar since I was hungry and even after reading the mixed reviews about the female bartender. So I sit down and of course there's a female bartender there (I'm hoping it's not the same one from the reviews but it had to be from my experience). She hands me a menu and paper placemat. I'm looking at the drink menu and I don't see mimosas. So I asked her if they serve mimosas. In a very sarcastic way she tells me,  are you asking for a mimosa? We have champagne. I'm like ok well I'm asking because I didn't see them on your menu. . I get my mimosa and end up waiting to order because my bf texts me to say he can meet me. So when she asked what I wanted to order I said I was going to wait for my bf. She grabs the menu and walks away. My bf walks in she got him his drink and I then had to ask her for the menu again. She grabs 2 menus and just puts them in front of us like she's bothered. We proceed to order since she asked if we were ready. I start to tell her my order and she walks away. Why ask me if I'm ready to order if you're going to walk away as I start to speak? So anyways,  she takes our order comes back with silverware and places my bfs nice and neat in front of him while she legitimately just threw a knife and a fork in front of me. I wish I would have taken a picture!! We get our food and not once did she ask us how our food was or if we needed anything. I ordered their kale and brown rice salad and added chicken. My bf ordered chicken wings. Half way thru my salad I find a hair in it!!!! So I asked for the manager and she did remove it from our bill. Now thru all this the staff was changing shifts. A new bartender was setting up for his shift and instead of the female that took our order asking us what happened the Male bartender was the one that addressed it and he didn't even serve us!! We did start to joke about it and because of the Male bartender is the ONLY reason we decided to leave a tip because I was not going to leave her a penny!! She's truly is rude!! She's clearly unhappy with her job. Maybe she should find employment elsewhere where she won't be bitter and rude to customers.   Also,  while I was waiting for my bf to arrive. I heard a Male waiter call a customer a bitch because she asked if their fish was fresh. He says something to the affect of, oh yeah its brought in daily and sarcastically tells his coworker what does she expect?.... mmmmm seriously? A customer asks a question and she's a bitch for it?   So some employees really take their job for granted there and need to seek employment elsewhere!!   I gave 2 stars simply because even tho there was a hair in my food it was still good and the other star for the Male bartender that understands you catch more bees with hunny instead of vinegar.   So when you read the reviews about bad service. They aren't lying!!!",

It was strong and tasted pretty awesome, but the sugar rim wasn't necessary at all.

Can't say anything about the food since I didn't have any (not vegan friendly for anyone who is wondering or cares), but they don't skimp on the drinks, and the smoothies aren't terrible for a quick breakfast.",

We ordered as soon as possible because we were starving and it took 30 minutes for our food to come out even though none of the dishes we ordered were complex. We ordered two salads, an artichoke dip, and a teriyaki chicken bowl. I got the BBQ chicken salad, and it was pretty good. There were a lot of different ingredients, such as beans, onion rings, corn, and avocado, so I didn't get sick of it. Portions were pretty big, and I was actually full from the salad, but I don't think it was worth $19. I also tried the artichoke dip, which was pretty good! It came with two different kinds of chips. I liked the pita one better. The artichoke dip was hot, creamy, and cheesy.",

The gravy we asked for on the side and made a nice accompaniment rather than slathered on the top.  The Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos for $26.00 were a rip off.  Let's just call them slaw tacos.  The ratio of fish to slaw was one part fish and six parts slaw.   Should have sent them back.  I had to dissect the taco just to get to the fish. The slaw was dripping in over sweet mayo sauce.   The teriyaki chicken bowl for $22.00 was boring.  Tasted like frozen veggies were used.  Service was good.",

Just veggies and cous cous, no meat at all. Something you could get at a deli or supermarket for like $4.    They have breakfast sandwiches too. I didn't have them, but I get the feeling they'd be descent.",

A bottle of water was $5 - bringing our small-ish lunch to share to $40.  We thought we'd give it another try the following day, it was better - the food may have been restocked overnight, not sure, but sandwich was great, fruit was fresher, water was still $5 - and total was $43 again, but better experience over all.

Need more cream cheese - the design squares are nice, but not functional. Easy on the red onions was good, and a nice pile of capers is always good too. Maybe it was the not typical squirt of lemon from me, but the usual salty flavors weren't there in harmony as usual.  SIde of hashbrowns was nice. Perfect portion sized tater tot crumbled hash nicely mixed with peppers.

My only complaint would be a lighter side like fruit as an option. But the sandwich was flavorful, the au jus delicious and really a great meal. I'd recommend asking for horseradish on the side for an extra kick but either way it's good.",

The ultimate nachos with chicken had our names written all over it. Once the gigantic portion of the nachos arrived we could tell that their name was not a mistaken. There was a giant stack of nachos covered by sour cream, salsa, cheddar cheese, olives, beans, cheese wiz like cheese, jalapenos, and chicken. 4 of us split the order, with it being a meal for 2 of us and a side for the other 2. These nachos definitely hit the late night craving. There is plenty of nachos to share, and we even had some left at the end as they do get heavy with the cheese whiz on it. Most of the nachos retained their crispyness and crunch, except for the bunch on the bottom that were smothered in the cheese whiz. While at Citizens I did see giant and I mean giant pieces of cake that I will want to try on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

It didn't look like there was a long wait, so we put our name in. She said 10 minutes. After 25 mins I asked what's up. She said \"That time was an estimation and as soon as the \"right\" table opens we will be sat\". I said ok.. 5 mins later we had a table. Now mind you the surrounding 4 tables were empty too. We sat there for at least 10 minutes  before anyone even came over. We ordered drinks, I a soda, my nephews soda and the last a water no lemon. When guy finally brought the drinks he brought water with lemon. My mom is allergic so we asked if he would just change it out. He had the worst attitude and when he came back he tossed the water on the table.This was completely offensive. I located the manager and asked or another server. The new server was nice but extremely slow. The surrounding tables all got their food long before we did. It was just not a fun experience. We will never, ever be back!",

I followed. Total came to nearly 12 bucks and I hand over the credit card. Cashier hands me card back and wife says, why so expensive?  Found out it costs $1 per cup for tap water. I was upset but cashier tells me sorry, already ran the card. I left feeling ripped off.  While my wife picked up cake I asked for manager to come to my table. Sean came over and listened to my complaint. Afterwards I learned employee was new, and that the $1 charge was because of night club people often came in just for water.  He then asked how he could make it right. In the end he did way more than we asked. He turned around an a angry customer.  Having said that the cake was really good as well. I'd go back. Hopefully they will be informing customers about the charge for water.",

These people have amazing customer service and made me and my friend have nothing but an amazing experience full of laughter and fun with these people. They are so wonderful at customer interaction and multitasking. If you are going to go to the bar, I would put in a request for Lizzy. If you are looking for a sit down, Glen is great too. In my personal opinion, this place is the best for a breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I would definitely come back here again. Atmospheres great and so are the employees.

The server explained that the Baconator was just like the Classic Burger except with \"bacon, bacon, and more bacon.\" That sounded great to me, which is why I ordered it.  The burger was not at all what I expected. First, the server simply dropped our food off and scurried away quickly. He didn't check in on us until half of our food was gone.  Next, I never received my potato salad. Instead, I received plain fries like my friend did.  Third, the bacon was not thick or piled on like I expected. I received 4 thin slices, that's it!!  Last, my burger was overcooked! I ordered medium and was given a chewy charred burger.  This place has some major improvements to make before I ever go back!",

Hungry after a night of partying and wanting something of sustenance in our systems before hitting Daylight, our group wandered into Citizens to pick up some food.  Between Boyfriend and I, we got a bottle of water, a fresh fruit bowl and a croissant. And it totaled to just over $16. WHAT. WHAAAT. The bottle of water itself was $5. FIVE DOLLARS. Even my croissant was only $3.50 (ONLY, she says). My poor wallet.  At least the food was okay. The croissant was light, flaky and huge, so I suppose it kind of made up for the price. The fruit was pretty good -- but unless it's spoiled, it's kind of hard to mess that up.  The other members of our group got various salads (I distinctly remember seeing the quinoa salad) and a tuna sandwich. Their food looked pretty good, but I didn't try it. Regardless, I didn't hear any complaints, so I suppose it was decent enough to satisfy our appetites.  Next time, I think I'll just go hunt down either a Starbucks or something instead if I'm craving a croissant. That's just ridiculous.",

We were seated at a nice table and the kids ordered sandwiches and I had a Maryland Mary (their version of a Bloody Mary) which is made with a homemade Bloody Mary mix. The sandwiches were a full meal, very nicely done. The Bloody Mary was REALLY good: very spicy and very flavorful. Couldn't even taste the vodka, which is how I like it, but it was definitely there. Yum.   Our server Michael was very attentive, we didn't order a large or fancy meal, but we were treated like we did. Our water glasses were always full. We felt like he genuinely cared about our dining experience.   We will definitely be back!",

The veg had a nice Kale salad with goat cheese and a wonderful dressing. The food at the Mandalay bay was outstanding overall and made staying there a real plus. They also have a nice grab and go area in the lobby of the restaurant that had a nice selection.",

    "text": "I wanted to update my review to A-OK. The reason? The owner reached out to me and invited me back into the restaurant for a different experience, which really says something. I was impressed by this action. Thanks, Jara.  I'm going to say that the menu sounds really good. I'm hoping that the service has changed since my last visit. Best of luck to this restaurant. Keep listening to your customers and I think you will do A-OK.  Review from Feb 2, 2013.  The scene:  Citizens Kitchen & Bar Hotel: Mandalay Bay Date: Saturday, February 2, 2013 Time: 12:00 pm There was a UFC fight the same day. Picture lots of men on steroids with tons of testosterone, pent up rage and Affliction t-shirts.  HA Food: 1 Turkey Sandwich, 2 Iced Teas and Chicken Soup= $66.00  I was craving some comfort food to help revitalize my energy levels. I had a giant sandwich on my mind, so I walked through the Casino in hopes of eating at the Red, White and Blue Restaurant. I come to find out that my favorite sandwich spot is closed and Citizen's Kitchen & Bar has replaced my go-to sandwich spot. Citizens prides itself on non fancy, REAL comfort food. The vibe is new American mixed with old fashioned comfort.  The environment was great, the service and food..not so much. When we arrived for lunch, there was one other group at the bar. We were told by our server that we were the first lunch customers EVER.   Since we were the first lunch customers, I didn't come with ridiculously high standards. I was here with the most relaxed group of foodies. I grew up in a restaurant, so I'm always pretty calm and understanding when things go wrong, however there were so many mistakes and unkept promises, I was embarrassed for the restaurant. Charles Barkley showed up 1 hour after us and still got served before us. Haha  It took us 2 hours to get a cup of chicken noodle soup and a hot turkey sandwich. We were told 6 times that our food would be out soon. The hot turkey sandwich with gravy was COLD. One turkey sandwich, one cup of soup and 2 iced teas cost us $66.00, no joke.   The manager did not listen to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience.  We didn't get a discount, but they offered us free pastries. We  were not interested. We won't be coming back here.   Tip of the day: You are better off going to Subway or a food court for lunch.  Take your $66.00 to STK, getting a mouthwatering steak + the mac and cheese and enjoy ridiculously superb service.",

Anyways, I ended up eating here 2x within 4 hours.    You can sit down in the restaurant and have a decent menu available to you or you can order from the counter.  The latter is better, over priced smaller bites.  The former has a wider selection - Vegas strip priced diner food.  I wish there were more options.  But at 4:30 in the morning after being up all night and still wasted, this place ain't bad.    p.s.  the pastries at the counter are good.",

This place is nicely decorated and there's seating outside-ish.  It wasn't really outside since you are still inside Mandaly Bay.

Told it would be extra, no problem. Jalapenos never showed up, we complained. By the time the server returned my friend had already finished his burger. Server came to explain they ran out of jalapenos. Burger itself was a bad, obviously frozen patty. Oh, and they forgot the fries as well, which were uninspiring.

I took them back and they refunded my whole order. I had a chance to speak with both the manager and GM. It seemed as if the GM didn't appreciate any of my feedback/concerns, i.e., Moral duty to notify the health department, my daughter can get sick,etc... I believe her response was \"we gave you back your money what more do you want?\" Almost as if I was keeping her from far more important things. The comment that really got her goose was when I told her I would also email the CEO. Her response to me was that I was making it difficult and she should just go ahead and charge me for the milks. Nice one! Just go ahead and punish anyone who disagrees with you. We came here for  dinner Wednesday night and they were out of the prime rib they advertised so I settled for the NY steak frites.

We sat on the patio, if it's a patio, since it's inside the building, but outside the restaurant. Got it? It was good because we could people watch.   I ordered the Loco Moco. Great choice to absorb any alcohol. lol  The meat was cooked just right and had quality taste to it. I liked the stickiness to the rice. I think the gravy could have had a little more flavor to it, but it wasn't bad at all.  Give it a try.",

    "text": "I went to see For the Record: Baz before it leaves Mandalay Bay and I decided to try Citizens for something different.  I was rather pleased with my meal and service there.  My server, Tony, answered some questions I had about the menu and he told me about some specials.  I ordered a small Caesar salad for a starter.  For the main, he recommended the fish tacos and I went with that.  For dessert, I again took his recommendation and ordered the carrot cake.  It was good following his advice!  The Cesar salad was a normal one, nothing special.  They could have left the hard piece of bread with baked cheese on it.  The bread was indeed hard and there was no cheese flavor.  It looked better than it tasted.  I have only gotten fish tacos once before so this was almost a new entree for me.  The tacos were filled to the brim.  The mahi mahi was tasty, there was some slaw, and each taco had a slice of avocado along with some chipotle aioli.  There were three side containers of sour cream, guacamole, and pico.  The tacos were juicy and messy eating, but worth it.    The carrot cake was a gigantic slice of goodness.  It was rich cake with a good cream cheese icing and nuts sprinkled liberally on the icing.  You are paying Strip prices for tacos you could get from a street vendor for much less.  The restaurant was almost empty and the quiet was enjoyable.  Tony was a great server and I'm glad I gave Citizens a try.",

Along with one of my colleagues, we had breakfast prior to a convention around 730am. Our server was polite, helpful and prompt. After we completed our meal, I ordered a latte to go. While there we ran into fellow colleagues and stayed another 15-20 minutes. Of course, the coffee was cold as ice by then, which I despise. I asked Oliver if he could warm up the latte before leaving. He said sure, please wait.   Turns out that Oliver had the barista prepare me a brand new latte. I was shocked with his service, demeanor, it's all in a days work attitude. And he would not allow me to pay for it or even accept a tip!  Oliver is a rare find in the crazy world of Las Vegas hotel dining. Thank you Oliver for making my day. Well done!!",

The croissant was lightly toasted so there was crispy factor to the sandwhich. The side of potatoes were cut into bite sized pieces and seasoned enough that it wasn't over powering but also doesn't require you to use ketchup for flavor. We also ordered an everything bagel toasted with cream cheese on the side that wasn't everything enough for me.

No cappuccino no macchiato no caffe latte no cafe au lait and no cafe mocha and no breakfast burritos nor bacon egg and cheese sandwich. Only half of juices available. But you can get a regular coffee fruit croissant. Even the girls at the counter acted snooty and could care less, but they sure expected a tip. Pathetic!  First gal never poured our regular coffee even though there was only one couple on line behind us. 2nd gal ROXANNE claimed that my MLife card had no points. I explained I wanted bill for MLife discount and gave her my credit card or offered room number and she refused saying my MLife card was incorrect.  Later, I had to spend time with MLife from my hotel room phone to fix the problem. Well there was no problem! Only problem was ROXANNE at CITZiZENS!  Thankfully Ashley at MLife applied the discount over the phone so I wouldn't have to stand in line. Thank you Ashley at MLife.  SKIP CITIZENS!",

They have what most American type eaterys offer, you know....Burger and Sandwiches. You can also pick up something togo quicly since there are pre made sandwiches located at the togo counter, duh. You will also fine a varity of random sweets and yogurts.   You have the option of sitting outdoor or indoor. I prefer outdoor cause I like to make fun of others while eating.

However, there really isn't much else I would have ordered from this restaurant.  Our server was friendly, but nothing too spectacular.  THE FRENCH DIP WAS THE BEST FRENCH DIP I HAVE EVER HAD!  The meat was of high quality, the au jus was tasty, and the bread was delicious as well.  It all went together so perfectly, although a tad bit salty (which was to be expected).  The french fries were sliced thinly and crispy, with some kind of seasoning that was perfect!  The macaroni and cheese was extremely tasty with peas and ham inside.  The cheese was so creamy and flavorful and the breadcrumbs that topped the dish was perfectly sprinkled with herbs.    Citizens is a very casual barstaurant with an interesting atmosphere.  My meal was served on a silver tray that was reminiscent of a elementary school cafeteria tray.  My friend's sandwich was served on a cutting board.  The \"kitchen\" theme here is very prevalent and unique in Las Vegas.  I would definitely go back to Citizens again.  I went for lunch, so I would be interesting in checking out their drinks one night as well.  Or perhaps to try their 24 sliders in 24 minutes challenge!",

The Hublet and I checked into Mandalay Bay for the 2013 IT Expo, threw our suitcases on the bed and dragged ourselves downstairs to try to bolt down some food before falling into an exhaustion coma.  We chose Citizens as it was the first non-formal place to eat that our tired feet brought us to.  The staff are polite and efficient, but the restaurant has a quick turnover feel to it and you do feel a scoosh rushed, however looking at the sea of people passing by you understand their desire to capitalize on the moneymaking potential.  We ended up visiting Citizens twice during our stay in Vegas and tried the following:  * Calamari appetizer: excellent.  I usually hate Marinara sauce with my calamari, preferred the gentle kiss of lemon juice, but their spicy sauce was a nice accompaniment. * BBQ Chicken Salad: basic but well done, although the chicken had a dry 'cooked earlier in the day & added at the last minute' feel.  Pretty to look at, well sized and filling. * Mushroom Blue Burger: this was a messy, messy meal that I enjoyed every second of.  Towering high, barely held together by a skewer, this rapidly fell apart and more napkins gave their lives here than for any other meal in Vegas.  Their sacrifice was not in vain. * Chicken Club Sandwich: the sourdough bread was the champion here, besides that it was a Club that wasn't any more or less tasty than any other Club sandwich, and the accompanying side of fries were delicious.  Prices are higher than you'd expect for somewhere that feels like a lunch place, however I rapidly learned that everything is a little pricier in Vegas, so this is a good average priced choice by Vegas standards.    The food is tasty but not life changing, however by Vegas standards this is a great low-key place for grabbing a quick bite to eat.",

We opted for the line though b/c we didn't know. There were like 10 employees working behind this counter and they could barely pour a cup of coffee. Three of them were working on one person's order b/c she must have had a comp meal or something but really there were at least 20 people in line while we listened to this. Once we made it to order, I just got the yogurt b/c I knew the wait for eggs might take until lunch. My friends got the banana pancakes and eggs benedict. The pancakes were huge, doughy and honestly just gross. There was nothing redeeming about them. The eggs benedict was okay but nothing too great. I highly recommend the breakfast at Raffles as a good alternative in Mandalay Bay. The outside of Citizens looks great but it's really not work the $15 yogurt and coffee breakfast.",

Having said that, the turkey sandwich was really great.   My second visit, at about midnight, was about the same service wise. However, they severely limit the menu past 11pm which is really annoying. While I understand the need to do that, the menu they use is almost exclusively appetizers, two pizzas and a burger.

I mentioned that the waiter George was \"AMAZING!\"   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!  We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:  1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill. 2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill. 3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168. 4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!  AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!

Our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience and genuinely seems to enjoy her job. I ordered a reuben and potato salad, which I definitely enjoyed. The Reuben was particularly good and was large enough quantity for me, even when I was really hungry. Unfortunately I checked in too late to enjoy the free cheesecake, but I'll get it next time lol. The food was priced about the same as the other restaurants in Mandalay, which was not too expensive. Overall, I enjoyed my experience.",

The servers can sometimes be a little slow to get to your table (happened two out of the three times we ate there) but they are all friendly.  I did like the atmosphere, it was simplistic upper-scale decor.    We didn't eat breakfast here but it looked like they had a lot of tasty sandwiches.  If you do not feel like sitting there and eating they do have a display case with pre-made food.  Just a tip if you are doing Paleo or low carb they do offer a protein box!",

One of the keys is finding solid meals, not meals where you want to stuff yourself but something just right to fill your stomach before an eventful night. Citizens got the job done for me on this visit. Their burgers specifically.   The meat is quality meat, ordered it medium rare, medium and medium well, all 3 times cooked to my exact demands and each and every time it was mouth watering. 4.5/5  Ingredients were fresh each and every time as well, the one time I ordered the bacon burger, it came through too. No staleness in any part of my burger.   Bun- Bun was good, maybe a 4/5 which is good for my standards.   Fries- For being just normal fries they left a great impression on me. Crispy and tasteful, mm mm delicioso.  Customer service was very mediocre though. That's all there is to say about that here.  If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay or any hotel within the block and you're looking for a quick bite, rely on Citizens to get the job done, they are open 24/7 which is reliability at its finest.",

He was complaining loudly to a server that he hadn't slept in two days. When my boyfriend asked for our tab he proceeded again to make more drinks, give a sever inventory on Grey Goose and came back much later to tell us only how much the tab was and if we needed to view a copy.

Our server was so nice and gave me a free slice of cheesecake because my friend had ordered an entree (although there were no signature entrees at this time at night). It was creamy and delicious. We also found out that even though Citizens wasn't on the written list of places were we could use our $100 American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts credit, we were able to get it deducted from our bill when we checked out.

We started with the tempura shrimp as an appetizer. The flavor was good, but it only came with about 5 pieces and wasn't anything too special. For an entree I had the Caesar salad. The portion size was large and taste was good, but once again nothing special. Probably the two most exciting things about my meal were my Bloody Mary and the giant carrot cake.

Erick had a full bar and still made you feel like you had his undivided attention. I don't think this place would be the same without him!

    "text": "Citizens is separated into two areas. The main part is the to-go deli like area (left side) and the other is the nicer, sit down Bar (right). This review is for the To go deli.  It is an in-house establishment staffed by Mandalay Bay. I mainly came here because I wanted to use the credits I got from staying at Mandalay Bay. I have to conclude that if you aren't spending credits from the hotel, avoid using your hard earned money here.  The first day, I had the Chicken Salad Wrap ($10) and a latte ($5). The wrap wasn't too bad, but it was extremely plain. I wouldn't eat it....if it wasn't \"free.\" Mcdonald's make better lattes (from its machines). Maybe it was, unfortunately, the person who was making drinks that day.  The Turkey Avocado, doesn't have actual Avocados. I believe it's a dressing. I had already left the premise to go back for questioning.  The smoothies are $10 each. I am from LA, but I'm not sure I felt my 'cold pressed uprising' agrees they are 'worth it.' They are prepared fresh.  Reflecting, I think my expectations for Citizens is a little too high. While the prices are high to reflect the convenience of eating at the hotel, I just feel it lacks so much. In Vegas, there are many eateries and lots of options if you are willing to look.  I definitely think sitting down at Citizens might have been a smarter choice, but the starting plate is about $17. If I could do it all over again, maybe I should have settle for a few cocktails and call it a day.",

I ordered the Ultimate breakfast because I wanted pancakes badly and all the other breakfast staples.   I sent the eggs back twice. I ordered over medium and both times they were less cooked than over easy.   The breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray.   The pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me.   Coffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that.   I finally settled on eating the soggy potatoes after he took my eggs away. I gave the pancakes away to my fiance. His omelet was bland at best.",

Also if I bought them I could not sit in their dining area because they're in - wait for it- transition.

The next morning I went there for coffee and here is where the problem arose. I eat oatmeal as I have a special diet for breakfast.  I asked for hot water with my coffee and after a discussion with I guess her manager, the waitress came back and said I could have the coffee but would have to eat the oatmeal elsewhere. I mean they are not crowded, I'm at the Bar so I don't take up a precious table. Won't be eating there again this trip just to reward their service.

This means that pickup lunch to carry with me is pretty important and having something that doesn't taste extremely processed or like it's been sitting in the glass showcase for days is also important. Here's where Citizens comes in.   For breakfast, they are ok. The early morning staff doesn't seem to be very helpful, perhaps that's because the coffee is pretty weak. There is a decent amount of confusion when it comes to seating and they are pretty unfriendly. Service was pretty slow - so do I recommend coming here to sit down? Not really.   BUT!!!! The sandwiches and salads are SO GOOD! I highly recommend the quinoa or the kale salad - both of them top my list as does the turkey sandwich. But if I had to go with one, I would choose one of their amazing salads.   The staff here is ok and the confusion due to long lines in the restaurant can get annoying but I say that salads are worth it, just take them to go or be prepared to sit there for a very long time. Also, cocktail of choice is the Berry Wise.   Happy eating! Recommended.",

I had excellent fish and chips and wonderful fish tacos as well as very fulfilling french onion soup.  I notice that this place can get super pack in just a minute since the swarm of people that come in during that special lunch hour window rushing to be seated. And thats why i will give a little acknowledgement to the efficient little asian guy who gets our group going in and out, on point with all the drinks and food order as well as willing to deal with 10 different split check. We appreciate your speed and your tenacity to handle our needy group. I think his name is tommy.   All and all, i am looking forward to dine in this place again soon.",

Basic food that will help you get on your way, and isn't fastfoody and greasy.  If you are from Southern California, think of it as an expensive, upscale Corner Bakery.  The items I got here were the turkey and avocado sandwhich (Very good, even at $14) and the breakfast burrito (decent, at $14).  You pay top dollar for being in the lobby of a top-notch Casino/Hotel (Mandalay Bay), so if you're looking for a dollar menu, call a taxi and have them take you off the strip.  Food on the strip will always have twice the price tag.",

Not many people were seated, therefore our service was excellent. They have the usual selection you would find at any 24 hour Vegas hotel cafe including a fully stocked bar. I ordered a breakfast croissant, nothing special stood out. It was tasty, a little on the oily side, but satisfying nonetheless. Hubs ordered a loco moco. I wasn't a big fan of the long grain rice they use or the gravy. Our server was friendly and prompt. She came by to check in on us and take refills in a timely manner.

    "text": "After a night at Foundation Room, me and my date had a case of the late night munchies. Citizens Kitchen and Bar was like a shining beacon that drew late diners in like a moth to a flame. Honestly though, it was our our only dining option at 1AM inside Mandalay Bay (thank goodness for 24 hour eating establishments, right?). Citizens was actually pretty crowded at this time of night. We only had a 5 minute wait to be seated, so no sweat.  Citizens is washed in bright lighting and white decor. Me and my gal pal were seated at a small table amid all the hustle and bustle. Our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders. When I got to looking at the menu, I quickly realized Citizens wasn't really a vegetarian friendly kind of place. I wasn't too worried because I was hungry but not like starving or anything so I was fine with getting an appetizer. Artichoke dip and chips it is! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a photo because my phone had died. :( The food came out in less than 10 minutes and was a good sized serving. I wasn't able to finish it all and left full. The dip had a great consistency and tasted great. Chips were yummy too.    Worth a Return Visit? I wouldn't go out if my way for Citizens, but if I find myself at Mandalay Bay in the wee hours of the morning I'd have no qualms about coming back.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #138",

I ate a whole slice hating it before I realized what it was.  Yuck!  (I guess if you like chipotle aioli, great, but if you don't, please list it on the menu. Chipotle aioli is kind of a big deal to people that don't like it.)  Not worth the money, but the service was sweet and understanding.  They credited me, but it's noted for next time.",

Got seated relatively fast and we quickly ordered off the one page menu.  Our party of four ordered quite a few items to share and all was quite good.   The Prime rib was AWESOME!  Highly recommended.   The Mahi mahi fish taco was ok and had a spicy kick in it.  The Cheese dip chips was amazing!  The dipping of cheese and chili was perfect filling for the late night cravings. The Buffalo wings were ok.  It was a bit acidic for a late night food but the taste was still good.  Server was really busy and the whole place was understaffed.  On a Saturday night, one large section was held down by only one server.  He seemed very collected but I can tell, he was a little overwhelmed with the requests from each table.  We didn't bother him much but there was a tables that had many requests every time he walks by- not sure if the server forgot and had to be reminded or it was simply the patrons asking for different stuff each time.  I wouldn't mind coming back again especially for the prime rib and the cheese dip chips.",

I ordered the French Dip which consisted of thin sliced prime rib, caramelized onions, Provolone cheese, and Au Jus.  It came with a side of fries (which were hot temperature wise and salted perfectly) and a pickle spear.  It was somewhat challenging to dip in the Au Jus because of the bread.  It was more of a hoagie bun and full of meat, so it made it hard to get that big sandwich into the little \"cup\" of Au Jus.  However, when I was able to dip it, it was good.  Justin, our waiter, was FANTASTIC!!!  He was very talkative and friendly, and checked up on us quite a bit to ensure that we had everything we needed.  He is an asset to the restaurant.  If you are hungry late night, or anytime really, then sneak into Citizens for a bite.  You'll walk away happy!",

We apologized and said we didn't see a sign so we weren't aware. He snapped at us and said \"I AM YOUR SIGN.\" That's cute, haven't heard that one before. Is this the kind of customer service a restaurant at the Mandalay Bay should have? Sucks that I'm staying at the hotel and had to be treated like this.

They were cold, hard as a rock and sponge like. We tried cutting them with a knife and it was impossible. We ended up not eating them. I've had microwavable pancakes with more texture and flavor. Disappointing for a $21 A piece breakfast. Terrible slow service. The cafe wasn't even busy and it took forever to get cold food.

    "text": "First off, a disclaimer.  I would like to point out that this experience happened while I was high on acid. This fact does not have any bearing on the specific rating of the food in general that will follow.   We entered the restaurant. I was greeted at the bar by a man that was quite muscularity toned and had a curly fancy mustache. He had a mildy creepy vibe about him, but he was nice. At this point I figured that I would just order a Reuben sandwich (one of my favorite go to's lately)  The food came and though the exterior was only lukewarm, the interior sandwich was what seemed like 600+ degrees and nearly resulted in 3rd degree oral burns. As I bit into the sandwich, it had the consistency and taste of what I can only imagine a mixture of elmers glue, sawdust and corned beef meat flavoring would taste like. How can you fuck up a Reuben sandwich this badly!?   It felt  like I was chewing sandpaper in my mouth. Remember now, my mouth is already burned by the hot coals of mysterious corned beef meat dust.  Unfortunately, this was all happening on top of loss of my overall perception of time and space. It was utterly horrible and terrifying as this moment started to replay over and over in my head. Mere seconds felt like hours.  I had to work very very VERY hard to eat through the sandwich that not only was shit, but also very highly priced. I proceeded to eat it because I was starving and wasn't going to be able to eat for a while. After complaining about the food with my buddy and also seeing that a fellow customer had walked out and complained about their food, we went onto the venue. It was at this point that I suddenly felt nauseously ill and proceeded to go to the bathroom to vomit profusely and watch this piece of shit sandwich enter the toilet in a plasmatic form all while mentally transforming through different layers of human existence and universes in my head due to the trip. After I had removed the majority of the sandwich from my system I realized that I had a little bit of coke left from the previous day.  I did a couple Trump bumps before exiting the bathroom.  Overall for food and atmosphere, I confidently rate this restaurant a - 1 out of 5.   EDIT. I just remembered that I had forgotten how shitty the cold French fries were. -5 out of 5. That's zero for you math geeks out there.",

Pair that with the relatively high prices ($9 breakfast burrito, $9 smoothies, etc) and it's not a particularly high value proposition.   The smoothie I got was the \"Green...\" something? I can't remember. But it had Kale and Avocado in it, and wasn't bad. My stomach wasn't feeling to great from a heavy dinner the night before, and it had a soothing effect. However it wan't the best kale smoothy I've had, and was probably the most expensive I've ever had at $9, so ehhh...   The breakfast burrito wasn't particularly good, but it was hearty and satisfying. They are pre-made in the morning, so you can't change anything about them. And while they are pre-made they need to be grilled to order, so they take quite some time. The worst of both worlds overall, but still was the best option for a relatively quick and hearty breakfast in the morning.   Still, we stopped by here almost every morning that we were staying at Mandalay bay for a business conference, as there really wasn't much competition for quick morning eats in the vicinity.   I would likely stop by and get food here if I was attending morning conference sessions at the Mandalay Bay conference center again, but probably not outside of that circumstance.",

A little bit pricey for cafe food but pretty good quality.   Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, not too busy and were immediately seated. The server was very friendly, took our order right away and frequently came back to check on our table. There wasn't a long wait for the food to come out as compared to the irritatingly slow food at Raffles.  The Tuna Melt I ordered was superb! I know it's a simple dish, but you can tell a huge difference between the sandwich here and a $5.99 melt somewhere else. The tuna had great quality while the bread and cheese were grilled to perfection. I love the crunchy softness. My friend ordered the French Dip Steak which was very good as well.  This place is well-worth coming back to if it was comp'd again! haha But I'd probably just stick to a cheaper cafe or grill if I were craving a sandwich.",

During our trip we ate here three times, once for breakfast, once for lunch and once at 4am..don't even know what you call that meal-- drunkfest?   For lunch I had the turkey burger which was about $20. It was nothing special but not terrible either. The cocktails we had at lunch were pretty decent.   Breakfast we had waffles and eggs... its hard to screw those up.   At 4am I don't recall exactly what we were eating.. I think it was probably waffles and french fries. The point is, they were open at 4 am and serving the entire menu! We couldn't get room service at the Delano at that time so Citizens saved us.   In sum, this place isn't fancy or all that great food-wise. It's basically like a diner (just more expensive than your average diner). I wouldn't eat dinner here but for a casual breakfast or lunch its just dandy.",

The cafe is open 24 hours and they offer salads, sandwiches, wraps and smoothies. A much better alternative to late night French fries or the $19 room service Cobb salad before service charge and gratuity. The staff was friendly except when I asked for some hot sauce to go, one chick said not a word to me and slammed a bottle of Tabasco sauce on the counter in front of me without giving me a Togo Ramekin. I was tempted to walk away with the bottle. But I didn't. My tuna salad wrap was $11 and some change and pretty hearty. I saved the other half for later.",

Not much flavor, and instead of coming w/ a side of fruit or potatoes, had a few bland tortilla chips on the side. And the \"salsa\" was bizarre. Super watery, no flavor. Kind of tasted like watered down tomato juice. Ordered a hot tea -- $5 for a cup of hot water and a tea bag. All in all, nearly $27 for a breakfast burrito and tea, including tax and tip. Honestly, the pre-made yogurt parfait for $7 looked a lot better; next time, I'm likely to just go with that.",

He did apologize for my wait, and was prompt with everything else.  He was also EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the menu and the alcohol/wine/beers.    I got the lasagna, and I'm glad I did, because guys, this was one of the BEST LASAGNAS I have EVER had in my entire life.  I saw other plates near the people near me, and everything really looked good.  I wasn't hungry enough for dessert, but my waiter did recommend a few good looking things.

The food was good, I had the nachos which were huge, the restaurant service was mediocre. Definitely not a priority.  I went to their to go bar to get a dessert on Saturday night, waited in line for 20 minutes for 2 customers ahead of me to be seen. There was one girl on one register and a line behind me. The display shows a bunch of parties and desserts and it looks like they are ready to go, this is deceiving! The lady in front of me ordered 2 tartlets and was told she would have to wait 10-15 mins for them to be made. I asked if the apple pie came with ice cream which i was told yes it does. Then charged and told I would have to wait 5 minutes only because they have to warm it up \"in the kitchen\". I paid and proceeded to wait 15 minutes watching all the staff on breaks and one girl working. I then asked where my pie was and she said oh that come from \"the kitchen\" so it takes a while, as if the kitchen were in a different building! It finally came, no ice cream, I asked and she said I hadn't paid for it, I was too tired to care, I grabbed the box and the pie wasn't even warm... waste of time if you ask me and really sub par customer service. Maybe you can get away with that because it's Vegas but I was pretty upset at the cost for such bad service.",

Of what I personally tried; The French onion soup is delicious. Cheesy, flavorful, and the serving was generous.  The French dip was also tasty. Toasted bread, tender prime rib, and another generous serving-this time of hot au jus.  The fish and chips is light, flaky, and with a touch of salt and tartar sauce has great flavor. The coleslaw was underwhelming.  I had a Citizen Collins with my meal and that was a great addition.   There were more orders on the table, I just didn't get a chance to eat them all! Everyone enjoyed their meals, including the 3 kiddos we had in tow. Our service was prompt and for the serving sizes I feel like the prices are fair.   I'll definitely drop back in if I'm hungry and on the prowl in Mandalay!",

Nothing fancy, no complications, just a good meal.  Well, thank you, Citizens Kitchen. You nailed it.   Highlighted by an exceptional server in Junior, this visit was a combination of quality food with terrific customer service. Open 24/7 and located within the Mandalay Bay Casino, Citizens sat me immediately and provided a nice setting to finish my day. They have seating inside and outside the restaurant, with a fence to stay separated from the lobby gladiators.  I enjoyed their hamburger with bacon and pepper, cooked perfectly and a large portion. The tasty fries, fresh and hot, served in a standing container and seasoned so well, was an added fringe benefit. Pepsi products here.   Junior (the server) was truly awesome, as I think he quickly picked up that I was a bit fatigued, had been working, and just needed a quiet, unrushed meal. Great recommendation on the menu choice, always there to make the dinner a good experience, but never intrusive and pleasant throughout. I'm thankful for his professionalism.  Thankful for the security staff at the Mandalay for their recommendation, as it was a very positive experience.",

LoL By that I mean, that their plates are big because their portions demand it. The cool thing is that the food is actually really good. They have a Mac and cheese that's a mini goblet of cheesy, gooey goodness! The fish and chips is a combination of steak fries and what looked like a piece of flank, it was so big. I'm actually not sure what fish it was, but it was bigger than the traditional red, plastic basket that carried it. The meat loaf was a solid brick of flavorful meat, set in amazing mash, topped with fried onion strips and green beans (ease the guilt of the heavy eating) and a mouth watering brown gravy. Really good! The ribs are a full rack that was taken from Babe, the Big Blue Ox and cooked to perfection. The meat was so easy to peel off the bone all you had to do was talk to it and it fell off. Everything we tried was well worth the price they asked for. If I may offer a suggestion: for something like the ribs. Order one plate for two and if you feel you need more, add a side like Mac and cheese (once again, so good and portioned so it could be its own entree). It'll take the sting off the bill and you'll have a great meal. And as much as I love to indulge my sweet tooth, the portions won out this time and I had no space left. But I'm sure they make something pretty amazing and hearty as well.  Definitely a place I'd suggest to try. Especially if you're staying at the Mandalay or the Delano.",

After a long drive and just before Jamie arrived, I was feeling mighty peckish but recognized dining options at a pricey resort are not so inclusive of solitary cheapskates like me. As I strolled among the restaurants and the hostesses in their strapless gowns, I came upon Citizens which turned out to be a slightly upscale 24-hour diner and bar. It's about three years old, so I wasn't familiar with the place.  I took a look at the menu and noticed it was all-American comfort food with Vegas prices. I have to say I was starving since I had not eaten since an early morning breakfast at SFO airport. The $15 Caesar sounded good to me, but I didn't want to use up room in my belly reserved for meat. The server offered a small version for $5, which was frankly quite abundant by itself with plenty of romaine drenched in a lemon garlic dressing topped with a Parmesan crisp (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F21GGabO&s=c351ad1fe43e6fb964b848c16252059dd84af0b2d94440b85b1cc6702a34e8aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/21GGabO</a>). It wasn't an artful plate but it certainly hit the spot. Now back to the size thing I was alluding to before. I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the $36 Citizens Prime Rib Dinner, oh yes, by far the most expensive thing on the menu.  What came out was a sizable cut of beef on the rare side but slow roasted apparently for 18 hours. It was satisfying enough with a nice crust though not as juicy or laden with au jus as I was hoping. There was a bit of sour cream on the side though surprisingly no horseradish. I should have asked for it, but the place was starting to hop at that hour. It came with a loaded baked potato heavy with a molten cheddar though the spud itself was a tad on the lukewarm side, while the steamed broccoli turned out to be one chewy stalk that required a sawing motion to get it into digestible portions (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1pnnNuG&s=3696610251c43c6d267bf73e14cded662286b31aba9eb1f138dab84a2a0fc037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1pnnNuG</a>). I couldn't finish the meat, so I took the rest back to the room where there was serious gnawing throughout the weekend.  FOOD - 3 stars...hits the spot when you're hungry and portions are abundant (consider the prices) but nothing really transcended AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious enough for a resort restaurant SERVICE - 3.5 stars...servers buzz around a lot but pay attention when it matters TOTAL - 3 stars...definitely a more reasonably priced option anytime you want it at Mandalay Bay",

None of us have ever been here and we love trying out new places to eat. Breakfast was on our minds and we were happy to have chosen this place.  I'll be honest, the food was amazing but I felt that it is just shy of being unique. The menu had some really great ideas but I feel like some items could be easily found in other restaurants. I think I may have to come back in the future and see if they've found their True character and add new items that would showcase the True essence of what this restaurant could be.  For that reason, I gave 4 stars.  But, let me share what I did love. The customer  experience. From the hostesses who greeted us and our waitress Jenna who was the most gracious host, was very attentive and made sure we were doing well throughout the whole time we were there.  The food was delicious. My cheesecake and creme brulee French toast was delicious. Huge in portion with fresh fruit and a nice orange creme was really good. I think to take this dish up a notch would be maybe add the brulee experience.   My coworkers ordered the Ham and eggs plate, bagels lox, & the crab cake Benedict (great idea).  The pastry counter wasn't really impressive, many of the items resemble pastries I could purchase at a commercial cafe chain.  The food and experience though, was just right for myself and my colleagues.  If you're looking for some breakfast, this could be your go to choice.   If Jenna is your waitress, you'll be in good hands!  :)",

Everyone in our group enjoyed the fish and chips, fish portion was HUGE. Also very popular the Ultimate Mary, it's a yummy loaded Bloody Mary. On this trip we plan on checking out the breakfast options. See you soon Citizens!",

    "text": "I'm a bit saddened to be writing this review and scoring Citizens a 2. We've been coming to Citizens now for quite some time. We visit Vegas about 3-4 times per year, most times staying at Delano. We've sometimes had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here in a single day just because we know we could always get a super solid meal no matter the time of day or night, even late late night since it's 24 hours. A few weekends ago we were here and were so incredibly disappointed with the Ruben. It tasted like minced meat. Like as if we got the last of the. corned beef shavings. The fries were tasteless and cold. Last weekend when we were here in Vegas, we passed. We are back again this weekend and thought we'd give it a go HOPING it was a \"one-off\" a few weeks ago. Nope. We were sadly disappointed.  Tonight we had a tuna melt and fries along with chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was decent. The chicken noodle soup is $11! Yep. It's a lot right? But in the past...SO worth the $11!! Tonight I just couldn't do it. I couldn't eat it. I suggested to our server that I was given some sort of beef broth type soup. She insisted it was chicken noodle. There's NO way what was served was chicken and chicken noodle soup at that. She said it was dark meat. If it was it had a beefy taste and the broth tasted like beef and the broth was brown. I couldn't pay $11 to not eat it.   I guess we'll have to find a new fave. We're super sad about it. It's just too expensive for it not to be good.   So why a 1 star rating? Decent size portions - but only matters if the food is good. Nice atmosphere. Can hear the live music from the bar. And hubs does love the $25 Bloody Mary.",

Jason if you're reading this, be sure  you wait on your tables accordingly, you don't want your party to give you bad reviews. Nor make the company seem to have bad ratings!  Also as for the food!

Honestly, I was travelling solo on business and it was the only resto in Mandalay Bay that had open tables so, I really didn't have a choice.  I ordered their French Onion Soup to start, which was pretty good.  It was definitely cheesy and baked to perfection but the broth wasn't as robust as I'd hope it would be, however, they sure didn't skimp on the onions!  Soup was $12.  For my entree, I had their Lobster Roll w/Pasta Salad.  I've had my taste of what a True Lobster Roll tastes like from a couple spots in the East Coast.  Unfortunately, this Lobster Roll had more pieces of celery than lobster; it was really disappointing, especially with a $23 price tag. The Pasta Salad also seemed like it was under cooked; the pasta that is.  Overall, there are FAR, FAR, FAR better spots to eat in Vegas, can't speak for the other restos in Mandalay Bay.  So, unless you're in a pinch like I was, I'd skip this place.",

    "text": "Yes, we went on their opening day but still, 2 hours for a lunch that consisted of a couple of sandwiches and a salad is completely unacceptable.  Since this place was Red, White and Blue like 5 minutes ago, I'm 99% sure they just re-branded the place and didn't replace their entire staff.  Of course, I could be completely wrong about that.  Even so, for a restaurant that was less than half full, they should have it together enough to throw some sandwiches on a plate.  On the bright side, our server was nice and always had our drinks refilled.  The food, once we got it, was decent.  My Greek salad was huge, although, I'm not sure it was Greek so much as an Italian chopped salad like the kind you'd get at your favorite pizza joint.  The salmon that I ordered with it was, despite being heavily over seasoned, cooked very well and pretty good.  The portions are huge but for the $32 I spent on a salad and an iced tea, I still think it's pretty steep, although probably on par with the rest of the hotel outlets.  It does look like they've put some thought and effort into their beverage program, which I appreciate.  I've been dying to try the new Bombay Sapphire East, which they have here and nowhere else that I've seen in the hotel.  They've also come up with a cocktail menu that looks like they've tried to put twists on some of what seem to be Vegas' most popular drinks.  If I hadn't been working, I would have given them a go.  Honestly, I probably won't ever come back for lunch because I will most likely be fired for being gone so long again.  Since I basically live at the Mandalay Bay for work, I'm sure I'll be back at some point.  Hopefully with a lot of time on my hands.",

Yes, the prices are a bit high, but it's Vegas and compared to other places, this really wasn't so bad.  Plus, the portions are large, which always helps with the sticker shock.  In our visits we had the chicken club, turkey burger, tots, onion soup, calamari, and bacon burger.  Everything was good, no complaints.  The onion soup comes in a HUGE mug, so note that it's not really an appetizer type soup.  Thankfully I saw someone eating it otherwise I likely would have ordered way too much food!

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in here after a night of fun, and arrived with a slight hangover...  At the suggestion of our waitress - I ordered their meatball sub. The meatballs were pretty flavorful and had a nice consistency. They proclaim on the menu that their sauce is a \"12 hour\" sauce, but I couldn't really tell because there wasn't enough of it on the sub... The best part though was definitely the sub bun, which was slightly toasted and had the perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft on inside. My wife order the BBQ pork sandwich, which she enjoyed. Her only knock on it was that it was supposed to have jalapeno's incorporated into the BBQ pork, but she did not seem to taste them in her sandwich. Aside from that, the pork was good. Once again - the shining star of the sandwich was the bread. For our side, we both ordered the seasoned waffle fries, and they were excellent.",

Everything about it is cute, warm, and welcoming - definitely a step away from the chic, haute couture-esque vibes that other Light Group places like Yellowtail & Stack aim for.   This review is only for the beverage & such service, but I don't think it's going to be too far from home. I was meeting a girlfriend at the bar for some drinks after a long workweek and we settled on Citizens because neither of us had been.   The restaurant was pretty much empty save for the bartop, which was close to being full. Next to us were a group of what looked like A/V or production guys that were just out from a gig at the House of Blues. With no seats, my friend and I posted up at the bar, and were quickly provided bar stools by two observant servers. The bartender was nice but it was hard to get a hold of her when we needed the check.   I am usually a fan of Light Group venues for the most part, but this one just didn't quite seem to hit the mark. It seems like it could be something really great, but maybe it was just too much hype too soon?",

We ordered the prime rib and meatloaf and a couple of crappy signature drinks that escape me right now. The red flag should have been when the food arrived in less than 10 minutes, but I was hoping they were just ridiculously efficient. I tasted the meatloaf and that was OK, good even, but worth $25+? Absolutely not. The prime rib was $31 and served with 3 onion rings. It was cold, chewy, and tasteless. On a positive, service was attentive so no issues there. I, for sure won't be planning to come back, its WAAAYYYY overpriced and just not that great.",

    "text": "- - FOOD POISON - - BAD SERVICE - - AWFUL MANAGEMENT - -  We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our Vegas trip and decided to get something to eat late night, unfortunately the only place open was Citizens Kitchen. We walked in and got seated, the server had problems taking our orders and since he thought he could remember everything without writing it down he then brought out some of the food wrong. It took them 30-35minutes to bring out the food. No one wants to wait that long for food at 2am. Five out of  six people ordered the same food and it was the Burger and let me tell you that the vacation ended right there! Every single person had the worst stomach pain and you can imagine the rest!  I asked for a refund  the following day,  the managers told me that I should send an email with my experience so they could look it over, Nick one of the managers actually tried to help and he told us that they were very embarrassed over this and would do anything to fix it so he asked for the receipt and that he would refund the money, until today I only received $45 out of almost $180, they couldn't even track our bill and refund the rest being that they have an advanced POS system. It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.  Two of the five  people that had food poisoning  actually went to the doctors the day after and were told that it was 100% food poisoning.  Save yourself some time  and pain, do not  go to this place. It has awful food and service. I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!  - - - FOOD POISONING IN VEGAS ON YOUR 1st DAY OF VACATION, HOW MUCH FUN IS THAT - - -    Manadalay Bay should seriously think about renting to this place since they are inside of this hotel and getting so many bad reviews...........",

The first time I was looking for some breakfast food in the hotel to bring back to the wife who was still sleeping in the room. This place was perfect!  They had a great breakfast menu that you can get to-go to include espresso drinks. The wait for the food isn't too bad. The price is reasonable considering you are at a Vegas resort. They have several smoothie options and their sandwiches are stuffed with lots of meat. Check this place out if you are staying at Mandalay Bay and don't feel like going to one of the pricier restaurants.",

We are still sitting here and it's blasting. Extremely inappropriate for a morning setting. We ordered coffee and water and received those pretty quickly. Not sure what is up with the water here, but it was disgusting. We also received them in skinny glasses without ice, while tables around us received them in bigger glasses with ice. The waitress took our order and it's easily been 20 minutes and we have not gotten our order. There is a couple that was seated about 10 minutes after us and they already received their food. Are you freaking serious?!?   (10 minutes later) ANOTHER table was given their food that came in 5 minutes ago. If I could give this place zero stars I would. Our waitress never checked on us to tell us why the food was taking so long. So we left. HORRID service. Now I see why they have such mixed reviews.

I like their yogurt parfaits and their bacon (maple) for a quick breakfast.  Hubby devoured their pancakes so they must have been yummy.

Some how they changed the price to $22 plus $6 for the chicken so I paid $30 for nachos....I understand this is a hotel but $30 for a plate of regular nachos is just ridiculous.   Luckily we still made it to the concert on time and I could have stayed and complained about the $6 up charge but I just wanted to get to the concert on time.   So overall I won't be back unless someone talks me into returning. Waste of $30 plus $4 for a soda....",

These in themselves deserve 4.5 stars (the -.5 because it was served with large serving of salsa, sour cream, and guac when each taco was already topped with pico, lime creme sauce, and an avocado slice. waste of good guac unless you want to bring me out some chips). So so so good.  Most \"meh\" thing on the menu: Mac & Cheese. I'm a huge mac and cheese fan, and I didn't have any desire to finish this one. Cheese sauce was lacking a cheese flavor. Ham is a good idea, but lets focus on the fundamentals first.   Service was slow. Very nice people, but 80 minutes for lunch? I get it's busy but come on guys, get us out of there in a reasonable time.",

    "text": "I enjoyed this place for lunch and breakfast (we came here twice during our trip to Vegas). It's located in Mandalay Bay, so it was close to us since we were staying at the Luxor.   The service here was good, and prices are pretty affordable for being on The Strip. It's a casual place that's not affiliated with a celebrity chef, so you'll never have to wait for a table.   Items we tried:  - French Onion Soup: HUGE portion. I think this is easily a two person starter. It was very flavorful, and had lots of cheese. The previous Yelp reviews on this did not disappoint.   - Kobe Chili Cheese Fries: I saw \"Kobe\" on the menu and knew I had to order it. Seasoned waffle fries came out with Kobe beef chili and a mini pitcher of nacho cheese. It was good, but it was very high in sodium (probably all chili cheese fries are). I would suggest trying this if you like chili cheese fries.   - 2 Eggs Any Style Breakfast: Yum! The tater tots were delicious! I ordered scrambled eggs and they were good. Not rubbery at all. If you order bacon as your meat, you will get three slices. It's breakfast, so it's hard to really mess this up.   Overall, I good casual spot for a quick meal if you're hungry and don't want to leave the area.",

The restaurant was relatively empty, but we still had to ask for simple things like water refills, bread, and condiments. (Bread was stale and toasted to warm, just sad.)

The Corn-beef Rueben was delicious, slightly on the heavy taste, but the flavor wise was good. I personally think it would have goes well with some mustard on the side just get a little kick to it. We also ordered chicken-noodle soup which is perfect for a hangover remedy. Last but not least, the nacho with chicken that comes in double size is not bad but it would have been better to have little bit more cheese and pico de gallo.

Once I got there and made my order(Turkey avocado sandwich), they said they were out of the cranberry walnut bread it's normally served on, which is part of why I wanted to go there to try it and they should've told me that on the phone. Whatever, I got it on sourdough instead. Then I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, the chicken soup and the green mean juice shake. They said that they wouldn't serve me the soup because it had been sitting there all day..... Ok then why have it on a late night menu if you're not going to serve it?   Once I got home I realize there was no avocado in my turkey avocado sandwich...again annoying...to pay for something I didn't get and not wanting to drive all the way back for it. Anyways, the food still tasted good and I could tell was fresh.   My bill was $35 for a salad, sandwich and drink.....pretty pricy but I don't mind paying to bad because the quality was good.

This time we had eaten a large late breakfast and missed lunch so we decided to grab an early dinner but looked for somewhere inside the Delano/Mandalay Bay complex where we were staying. We had never tried Citizens before and were also on a tighter budget and their prices fit our hotel credit balance better. Yeah, talk about cheap! Anyway, we decided we could live without steak and crab this time around. Perhaps it was because of our timing, no apparent conventions in town, there was a marathon actually happening at that same time out on Las Vegas Blvd, and it was an early dinner but we got the best service anyone could ever expect. Erick \"with a C-K\" was funny, courteous, recommended his faves and left me thinking \"I'll come back here to eat again the next time we stay at the Delano\" unlike some of the other restaurants there. The food: I started with French onion soup and had a French dip sandwich. Way too much delicious food. I couldn't finish it. Erick and I agreed we both like KFC coleslaw and he said Citizens was as good if not better and I had to agree. My GF had fish tacos in the lettuce wraps option instead of the normal tortillas and despite having some spice to it which she usually doesn't care for, she finished it all and kept saying how good it was.  We'll be back Erick \"with a C-K\"! Hmm, the prime rib or full rack of ribs?",

Next, I tried a salad-- it was HUGE and FRESH and delicious! The following day I had a sandwich which, again, was HUGE and freshly made and delicious!

Since I was in Nevada I thought the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis was my best bet. This was the best part of my meal. Served bottled with an empty tall glass that tasted like Beer on tap. Super crisp and refreshing exactly what I wanted. It tasted like a cool summer day.  Lunch: My All American comfort meal the Blue Beat, included Blue Cheese, Red Wine Mushrooms & Cherry Peppers. Although the burger was cooked to perfect (medium rare). I felt this burger lacked sauce, it was very dry and hard to eat. The mushrooms were barely sauteed almost raw. I felt like something was missing. The fries were delicious, fluffy almost like truffle fries. They were served in this cute basket.   Overall I'd come back for the beer & fries. It's not at the top of my list but if I was starving I wouldn't mind coming back.",

The food was great on our first visit and the server accommodating to dietary needs and requests making us fall in love with the place.   The second visit, our server was totally slammed and he was very much absent minded, leaving us to wait over 20 minutes for a Mimosa from the clearly empty bar next to us.   He also wasn't really down with the hospitality and wouldn't let my guest order the exact same thing she enjoyed the day before which struck me as a little odd.   Had we not been in a hurry, we would have probably asked to see a Manager but it was so busy we just sucked up and left.   What a difference a day makes......",

    "text": "First time here. As a Vegas local, I usually try to avoid the Strip places, as from what I've seen they're usually overpriced tourist traps. I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised by Citizens. I had been considering Citizens as an after-concert choice (Neil Diamond!), since it's open 24 hours. We arrived at Mandalay Bay early and had an hour and a half to kill, so we decided to eat before the show instead.  After checking out the menu board outside and getting on the list, we waited about 3 minutes and we were seated in the outer \"patio\" area. Our server, Nick, greeted us very shortly thereafter and brought us our drinks, offering to answer any questions we had about the menu sections. I decided against spending $40 on a 14 oz NY sirloin steak and went with the bacon burger (medium done, add cheese, hold the onions) & fries. My wife chose the NY-style pastrami sandwich. Being that it was 5:45 pm, I expected to wait a bit for my order to come out. After 15 minutes or so Nick came back to the table and apologized for the wait, explaining that they were very busy and that he would see to our orders ASAP. I thought that was really cool of him, because I cannot tell how many times I have been sitting in a restaurant, getting aggravated looking at my watch over and over, while the wait staff hangs around chatting or walks by us over and over like we haven't been sitting there sipping our drinks for over a half hour. The food arrived a few minutes later and it was time to dig in.  My burger platter, served on what looked like a cookie sheet, was the perfect size for the $20 price tag: a good-size, nicely stacked burger with tomato and shredded lettuce, cooked and prepared exactly as I had requested and skewered through the top bun with a large pepperoncini that would make Papa John cry, a decently-sized \"bucket\" of shoestring fries and a half pickle slice. My wife's equally-priced sandwich was huge (the half she couldn't finish wound up in the car in a to-go box before we went to the show), stuffed with perfectly lean pastrami, along with a side bowl of potato salad (or fries or cole slaw) and also sporting that pepperoncini and pickle slice. Both orders were delicious and appropriately priced for the portions we received. When it came time to settle the bill, I jokingly asked if they do employee discounts for fellow MGM employees, to which Nick said he would go check. He returned a couple of minutes later with, to my surprise, a new bill reflecting a 20% discount (which I kicked back to Nick on top of the original tip for his great service) - a definite high-five to Citizens for that!  All in all, I still generally think Strip dining establishments are tourist traps, but I also think they have not yet seen the last of me at Citizens - it seemed to be, at least to me, one of the few exceptions to the rule.",

They had their menu on the outside and I saw they had a lobster roll. That is all I needed. So I went to the hostess and got seated. I was told a server would be by shortly. Um not what happened. Now the place was virtually empty and I noticed my server had looked over and saw me sitting there waiting but he never came up and offered me a drink or anything. He just kept staring at me and carried on conversations with his co workers. It made me very uncomfortable. Then he finally comes up and asks me if I am ready. He offers no apology for the wait or the fact that he saw me sitting there and did nothing. He did not ask me if I wanted a drink or anything like servers normally ask first he just asked me if I was ready and had a huge attitude when he asked. The annoying tone in his voice was like I had kept him waiting while I stared at the menu forever or something like that. His attitude surprised me considering I knew what I wanted from the second I walked in and I was the one who was kept waiting but ok. I also wanted to get to the Shark Reef aquarium before I started collecting my social security so if anyone should've been annoyed it should have been me. I ordered my food and guess what more waiting. Again he was too busy doing his own thing to go check on my food. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. I know it was not the kitchen for one thing the lobster is served cold so is not like they have to cook the lobster and heat it up or anything and my side was coleslaw. How long does that take? I had already thought it was a mistake coming there because my server acted like a complete asshole but it was even worse after I tried this pitiful excuse for a lobster roll. It was disgusting. After I picked through my food I waited and waited for the server to bring me my check. I had to flag him down at some point because if not I would have sat there forever. Well wanting my check must have been a problem because Mr. Attitude acted even more stuck up when I flagged him down and asked for my check. Needless to say after $23 for that lunch I felt leaving unsatisfied and downright stupid for wasting my time and money there. The food was shitty and the customer service was even shittier. others many have a better experience but personally for me I will not ever waste my time and energy here again. Mandalay Bay and Vegas itself has WAY too many superior options for dining for me to waste me time where I am clearly not wanted.",

Drink glasses never dropped below half the entire meal!  The Crab Cake Benedict was a hit! That was a unique meal with a great taste! Very well cooked and the crab was actually crab! The breakfast burrito, banana waffle and the California omelet were stated to be delightful!

The chili was to DIE for.  Very mild with chunks of premium beef.  Tasted devine with sour cream.  The waffle cut fries were delicious and arrived in this cute little basket thing.  Which actually seem to be like the thing to do in Vegas now.  Must be a hipster chef thing.  The chicken wings were WAY spicy but my husband enjoyed them.  I really like this place for a quick treat.  Staff was great.  Be sure to take home a candy apple to eat while you watch a movie.",

I'm not crazy about fish tacos but they're fantastic here. For me, the calamari really hits the spot. The breading isn't too much and the calamari inside is perfectly chewy and firm. For dinner, I got the burger. Which was solid, classic American.   Don't miss this spot, drinks/calamari appetizer/Tacos/burger, won't disappoint!!",

I shared the Tarragon Chicken Salad Sandwich (with a side of potato salad) and the Kobe Beef Fries with a friend. The sandwich was really good! It comes on toasted bread which works well with the texture of the chicken salad. It's a good size too. The potato salad was ok, but nothing special.   The fries were actually really good, but I don't know if they are worth the price. I think you lose some of the kobe flavor when you mix it with chili. Still, really tasty!  Service was really great too. Our waiter was on top of his stuff, and he was straightforward about everything in the menu and his suggestions (which I have grown to appreciate in a waiter).",

Over the phone would be great if they answered their phones.  I've tried three times to place phone orders, the first time after 43 min of calling and getting the hotel involved they would not answer their phone, I ended up driving down there to place my order.  Second time I came here I decided to try calling again. Yayyyy they picked up the phone...then put me on hold... an hour and 38 min later I drove down still being on hold to show them that no one is answering and that I was on hold for an hour and 38 min.  I spoke with the manager (Shawn) and  he apologized and said there must be something wrong with the phones.  I called as he was standing there and voila they worked fine.  Weird.  Today a month later, I decided to try my luck one more time.  Driving past state line I called and someone answered the phone yayyyyy... NOPE. Again placed on hold and drove all the way to the Mandalay again to show the same manager that I've been on hold 38 min.    He apologized and again gave me there must be something wrong with the phone schpeal.  Tried calling while standing there and holy cow the phones worked.   When I was on hold all of these times I tried calling on three way to see if they would pick up and the phone just rang and rang.   Back to today, I placed my order to be told they are all out of the bread that my 5 sandwiches come on..  I asked for a croissant instead and a girl named  Heather said you need to pay extra for that.  Super condescending and rude.  The only one that handled this professionally was Sarah.  Jessica decided to come to me and directly  say you need to move your bags(the food) they just brought out to me off the counter.  She argued in front of the customers and two other customers stated that the customer service is horrible.  Was this girl for real??? After everything I've been put through she is raising her voice in front of other guest and telling me to move my food bags in a condescending voice.  Ughhh.  So sad the food is really good here but they need to clean house and hire staff that knows how to work with guests.  Thanks Sarah for your help!   Shawn the manager just kind of looked at me glossy eyed  both times I spoke to him so I'm not sure he's going to address the issues at hand.  Some how the staff acted as if I was in the wrong here.  Please citizens get it together. Mandalay is an amazing place this restaurant should be ran with the same customer service as the place it's in.   So sad",

Both times the food took forever for what was a simple order.  The second visit was ridiculous. There was one person ahead of me who got her parfait and was on her way. We order a parfait, donut, hot tea, and fresh juice. Everything except for the juice was grabbed from the counter. The juice took over 15 minutes. Everything was already pre-cut in a cup, all the person had to do was add orange juice and blend.  They were clearly understaffed, and for the prices they charge there is no excuse.  Also, when I was paying the second day the girl working the register asked if I needed a receipt. When I said yes, she handed me the itemized receipt. I asked her where the credit card receipt was and she said she threw it away. I told her I needed it because this was a work expense. She then proceeded to dig through the garbage until she produced my crumpled receipt. That is not okay, if someone says they want a receipt they should be given both receipts, or at the bare minimum the credit card receipt.  This place would be good if they could just get their ish together!",

Brunch might be the best time to go if you want to pig out on plenty of sweet and savory offerings like I did. The massive stack of red velvet pancakes may be one of the better versions in town. Just bring family or friends to make a dent in it. The creme brulee French toast is another exceptional rendition on a classic with bread dense enough to soak up and retain plenty of custard and a well crusted exterior that provides plenty of crunch.   For savory options the kobe chili cheese fries were good -- particularly the light, crispy waffle fries that held up well under the meaty chili. They don't skimp with portion sizes on that dish or the big meatball parm, which is a single baseball sized hunk of beef and pork topped with a dollop of ricotta and sitting in a pool of sauce. A less than stellar dish is their ultimate tots -- standard tater tots covered in cheese and gravy. The chicken and waffles also proved to be decent, but far less memorable than the other dishes we tried.  Ending the meal was an excellent house-made carrot cake. It's moist and dense spice cake foundation with subtle hints of carrot were complimented by plenty of sweetness from a smooth and creamy cream cheese icing.   It's clear that the Light Group knows who their target audience is and how to satisfy them. With Citizens, they deliver comfort food fit for a casual meal any time of day",

He also didn't inform us that there were two options of the kitchen menu and the cold sandwich menu, which differs in one thing: toasted vs untoasted bread. $20 for a toasted sandwich, $13 for untoasted. Bottle of Fiji water is $9, service is inattentive, and getting the food was also very frustrating.",

    "text": "Yelpers have rated Citizens at 3 out of 5 stars.  When that's the aggregate rating out of hundreds of reviews, for me personally I begin to think the establishment might be shitty.   Especially when there is a sprinkling of reviews that are at 1 star with all kinds of jacked up things being written.  \"3\" may be \"A-OK\" according to Yelp, to me it means the place is questionable.    So if you don't want to fuck around with Citizens and risk disappointment, here's my advice:  Go to the the takeout counter and order either the Reuben or else the turkey avocado sandwich.  Simple as that.      These sandwiches are so good.   The ingredients, the breads, the thinly-sliced soft and moist deli meat... Adds up to an amazing sandwich that I go out of my way for.   Trust me.     Yes, these sandwiches are expensive.   Around $15 for one sandwich to give you some idea.    But damn worth it, and I keep going back for it.  For the times I drive in to Vegas from So Cal, I typically order extra sandwiches to go as a snack later on.     But if the price still seems completely outrageous to you, I won't fault you.  Just do it if you're comfortable.   However, to put it in perspective, what did cost you to get a bottle of Grey Goose last night at Hakkasan?   Or even one cocktail at Light... How much did that cost?  How much money did you put out in the casino?   What did you spend on the stripper with your buddies?  Exactly.      So shut the hell up and get one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!!!",

Open 24/7, and still operated by Light Group despite the recent Hakkasan acquisition, it was just after 11am that a friend and I arrived at the Citizen hostess podium and dining as guests of the manager it was mere moments before we were led to a large four-top at the restaurant's back corner - the low-slung leather banquets of soft leather so comfortable that one might want to take a nap in them, particularly with the sounds of Dylan, Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd playing from the speaker system above.  Obviously a restaurant of dual personalities, the weekend brunch a casual and laid back affair while late nights are said to be a raucous mess of patrons exiting nearby Light Nightclub, it was under the watchful eye of a British gentleman named Tim that our meal took place and whether an effect of being known to the chef or simply the young man's mannerisms the service could not have been better - easily the best I've experienced in Mandalay Bay with plenty of whit and knowledge to compliment an eight plate feast with enough food that it could have fed two-to-three more.  Noting up front that the 'grab n' go' section is mostly devoid of housemade options, instead outsourcing all but the cookies and a few cakes due to kitchen constraints, it was with four savory dishes that the meal began and with plenty of par-for-the-course Lavazza to wash it all down the first round was a bit of a mixed bag - the chicken and waffles excessively priced at $24 with both items less crunchy than would be ideal, though the tots and waffle fries each proved crisp and quite capable of holding up to cheese and meats with substantial depth of flavor, an adult-fist of a meatball also standing out with impressive tenderness beneath a good sear in a bath of bright tomato sauce with grated cheese adding just enough salinity to make it all shine.  Moving next to a duo of sweets, it was somewhat surprising that the Red Velvet Pancakes were not to be found on the weekend menu, but with a simple request a substantial stack of three Frisbee-sized discs was produced with each proving exceptionally fluffy and loaded with cocoa beneath a checkerboard of cream cheese frosting, the neighboring French Toast another hefty option with a crunchy topcoat overlying four supple-centered slices dripping with custard as fresh cream and strawberries completed the picture - both plates on par with the best in the city, and the former amongst the best nationwide.  Unwilling to forgo desserts, and as such requesting the rest of the pancakes be packed up, it was with little hesitation that a slice of carrot cake was ordered and clocking in at probably 12-ounces the four layer slice would prove not only enormous but also outstanding, the moist base bespeckled with carrots, raisins, and nuts amidst a bold spice heavy in cinnamon and nutmeg - a pair of freshly made cookies proving equally delicious and thus leaving one to wonder just how much better Citizens could be if it brought the whole pastry department in house.",

The waitress was nice at first. She tended to us, answered all our questions, and took our order. It took a long while to get our food, but we didn't want to make a big deal because the Olympian Soccer player, Mia Hamm was sitting right next to us.   I ordered the Mac and Cheese which the cheese was so runny, it looked like clam chowder. The cheese wasn't orange, but it was white. I also had the Smothered Tator Tots which was good. My fiance had the Tuna Melt and Corn on the Cob, He enjoyed the corn, but said he had better Tuna Melts.   After we got our food, we noticed the waitress so involved with Mia Hamm and her guest. We finally made eye contact and asked for our bill. When I gave her my credit card, the waitress came back with my reciepts to be signed. I was writing a tip and calculating my total when the waitress came back. She apologized and said she accidentally put Mia Hamm's table on my credit card. She said, since they didn't close the bill, my credit card will not be charged. WRONG! I went on my bank statement that day and I seen two charges for Citizen's. One charge finally dropped off two days later.   I wouldn't come back again. There food is ridicously over priced for what it is. There are a ton of other great restaurants in Vegas.",

I was about exhausted when we stumbled in around 11p and didn't really care where we ate, I had a $40 per diem to use and hadn't eaten since lunch.  The menu looked good enough, there was immediate seating and it was easy access to the elevators....Sold!  I ordered the Lobster roll with potato salad and if I could go back in time I might choose differently.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I expected either.  The roll is more like a piece of bread with a slit in the middle to stuff the lobster mix into.  Good flavor on the bread and plenty of lobster but that is no roll.  Now the potato salad must not be their claim to fame, it was boring and limited in quantity.  I mean, I get it, it's potato salad but come on let's make it taste good.  This was chunks of potato with mayo, and if it wasn't that is what it tasted like.  Good thing is there is a ton of stuff on the menu, they are open 24 hours, (I think) and it's super convenient if you're staying at the bay.",

My wife got served a beer is a dirty glass, nothing got recommended, we did not get checked back up on ( servers who can't handle 3 tables need to get out of the game and move states) the food was ok but services from step 1 was the worst ever so would not go back and will be making sure I let every1 know this!!! O and I tried to contact the manger 3 times to give her some feedback  but she hung up my call 3 times and left a VM but nothing, I hope the owner of the company reads this and really thinks about the staff he has working for them!!!",

Given that it's Vegas, I forgive the $20/entree, but the food was just alright.  Next time I'll make the short walk to the burger bar.",

The food was pretty good, had the cobb salad, which isn't going to be a mind blowing experience no matter where you go, lol.  But because the bartender - Raquel - was super cool, I actually ended up going back two more times the following days.  I got the mahi tacos - bomb - and the chicken wings - good chicken, but a tad over sauced.    I give this place a solid 5 just because I like chatting with Raquel.  But the mahi tacos are definitely worth it too.    if you are looking for some decent food and cool people, definitely give this place try.",

Too much dressing - really wish they could have the salads w/dressing on the side or ease up! But yummy anyway. Also nabbed the crudite veggies and tossed the ranch dressing. Pricey, but I was happy for some fresh veggies! The sit-down side got me through breakfast with a tasty CA omelette. I got the eggs fried (and requested them cooked in butter not oil) with avocado, sour cream and pico de gallo on top. A little pile of tatertot hash came with. Was it mind blowing? No. Was it tasty, fresh and satisfying? You bet. The hash was \"meh\" but I could see folks liking it for that salty kick back to grade school.  Coffee (iced americano w/soy) was quite good.  Service was attentive and friendly, no complaints.  All in all I am grateful this place is here and will gladly come back knowing I can get a fresh tasty meal. Expensive? No more so than the rest of Vegas. Thanks, Citizens! (I'd actually give them 3.5 stars, 4 if the menu were a little more inspired, but all in all the food is reliable, good, and fresh.)",

Once we'd looked at the menus and the server came to take our order, we were told that what three of us were ordering wasn't available that night (one being fish and chips, if you can believe it). It didn't get better from there. Food is mediocre at best and the service is spotty. Took forever to get our check so we could get the heck out of there. There are better options than Citizens.",

I came in just to relax after a travel day.  The restaurant looks inviting, but they have a to-go area.  I just said I wanted a coffee and a treat and a place to wind down.  They directed me to the hostess to be seated.  We were seated and when I told the waitress that we just wanted some teas, coffees and some pastries she told me that I could take my stuff to go in a paper bag and to sit outside of the restaurant.  I was only allowed to sit in there if I was to have FULL service.  What does that mean?  It's 2:30 in the afternoon.  What a rude waitress.  She promptly took away the menus and didn't even give a chance look.  She even told the 3 of us, maybe you can drag some tables together out in the promenade so we could all sit down.  Never again.  I worst service ever.  I'm glad I didn't even get a chance to waste my money here.  If I could give zero stars I would.  After reading all the other reviews I'm glad I didn't spend my money on some thawed from frozen desserts.  Go to Starbucks instead probably more consistent.",

We ordered a Caesar salad ($16) and a turkey avocado sandwich ($10ish). First of all, you think you can't mess up a salad. Especially a Caesar salad that's $16, right? Wrong. This was the worst salad I've ever tried. The croutons were extremely soggy and chewy (probably from the moisture)- all their salads are pre-made and sitting in refrigerators. The chicken breast was also extremely dry and inedible.   The sandwich that we ordered was okay, but the \"avocado\" was NOT real/fresh cut avocados. It was some kind of green, mixed with things avocado paste, a poor excuse for avocado.  There are better options if you keep walking thru the casino (I.e. burger bar). Avoid this place if you can.",

It was around 9pm and we hadn't had dinner so we decided on Citizens because it was close and easy. It was by far the worst meal we had all weekend.  Pros: The service was excellent. Our waitress was really friendly and checked in throughout the meal. The food was brought out quickly. We split a salad and they were nice enough to portion it onto two plates in the kitchen.  Cons: The food was bad and expensive. The mixed greens salad was as described on the menu, lettuce with carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes, but like 95% lettuce. To be fair, it was a very large portion. The dressing could've been better. The Teriyaki Bowl was literally a bowl of brown rice with maybe a half a cup of vegetables on top, for $22. It felt like something a student would make to save money. The nachos were the worst. They were basically inedible, but again, huge portion. How do you mess up nachos?? I think most of it came from using cheese sauce rather than real cheese.  Overall, I was let down by the quality. Our bill came to around $100 for two (2 glasses of wine, 1 salad, 2 mains + tip) We ate next door at Lupo the night before for about the same amount and the food was SO much better. I would suggest going there instead.",

Offering both hot food and cafe treats, it is a place for you to shake off your munchies.   The appearance is up to par with a Vegas casino restaurant, open yet individual, not appearing like a hawker Stall. The restaurant is divided. One side has a French style cafe with a pastry counter. The sweets look terrific. On the other, is a bar with tables. It is very neat, yet casual. Perfect for a quick in and out.   The service was slow, and honestly very incompetent. Our waiter took 20 minutes to bring water and tea, there were only three parties there, two of which were being served by other employees. I asked for some Splenda, and he ran off and forgot. The orders were not written down, and subsequently did not arrive in the descriptor form. This is the fault of the service.   Food came out at a reasonable time, as when the cooks got the order, it came out hot and fresh. The food was cooked to order, which is rare for a casino pub.   The food was very salty, probably a bait for ppl to order more alcohol that is jacked up to state maximum prices. One salad and one order of pretzels was around 50 dollars. Vegas prices? I think not. Over all, if you are drunk or don't care for anything but filling your stomach and having a good time, this is the place to go. I would not come back to intentionally dine. It would be a spontaneous thing if I were to return.",

Both of which were great.  The waitress was kind and was on it with filling up our coffee cups. They had a full bar and their cocktails looked delicious but we opted out on booze for the morning!  The restaurant itself was cute and there is an option to grab stuff from a coffee bar with some snacks, salads and sandwiches.  Not too bad would go again if I were staying at the Mandalay Bay",

My wife had the lox and bagel, which were prepared textbook except for the bagel, which needed to be toasted a little more.  Our server quickly fixed it.  I tried the chicken aguachiles, which was their (breakfast) take on the Mexican classic.  It was off the chain!!  I substituted medium poached eggs for over-easy.    If you're looking for a quality breakfast, minimum wait, and don't really need a buffet, Citizens is a solid option.",

Their prices aren't bad but at least here you get 2 things very consistent every time which is great service and great food. I have had a ton of things off their menu but I really have 2 stand outs. First is the brick chicken...which is so delicious. Always moist, always juicy and full of great flavors. The second is the BLTA sandwich...the funny part is most BLT's lack a lot of bacon. One time here I ordered and asked for extra bacon and the waitress said \" I tell you what if there's not bacon let me know and I will bring you some\"? At first I thought why wouldn't you want a little extra money on the bill till the sandwich came out and literally had 1.5-2\" of bacon. This sandwich has the perfect bread to protein ratio with thick sliced tomatoes served on sourdough bread. At least 1 time during every trip I get this sandwich it is so good. Doesn't have to be complicated to be great.   Bottom line breakfast, lunch or dinner the Citizen is a great spot located in the Mandalay Bay Casino. Even if your note tying here well worth trying and in a hurry they have another whole side to their restaurant catered to quick on the go food.",

We had just gotten off the plane and we were starving for breakfast.  We were able to be sat immediately.  That is where the speediness of the morning ended.  The restaurant was not even half full when we were sat, yet we waited for far too long just to place our drink order.  Then we waited what felt like a lifetime for those drinks to actually arrive at our table.  We placed our food order and I bet you can guess it.  Yup, that is right, it took what felt like another lifetime.  It was beyond our comprehension why everything was taking so long, because again, the restaurant was not even busy.  By the time our food did arrive we scarfed it down, we were starving.  We tired to pay our tab quickly, but we were completely unsuccessful.  We definitely waited over 15 min just to cash out.  What I would say is that the food is completely edible, but only if you have ample amounts of time to wait for it at Citizens.",

He took our order and then played on his phone for the rest of the time.  Well until it was time to pay.  He seemed very uninterested in doing his job that day.  It's kind of embarrassing when you bring out of town guests.  For my meal I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos.  There was a very distinct fish taste like it was almost going bad.  Luckily I did not get sick but I didn't really want to finish them.  These were grilled fish tacos with guac, slaw and chipotle aioli.  I did not taste the chipotle aioli one bit.  They definitely needed some help in the flavor department.    A bit of a mishap when our food was delivered as one of the drinks was spilled.  They brought out complimentary cheesecake to atone for the mistake.  Well, it was certainly a nice gesture but the cheesecake was very dry.  It almost all crumbled which was a disappointment.    For such a prime spot in Mandalay, I expected much more.",

The restaurant is one of the first restaurants when coming from the parking garage. That made it easy to find and convenient. Our orders came out quickly so we weren't pressed for time getting to our show. This is probably the least expensive sit down restaurant on property. It is still overpriced for what you are actually getting though.  For dinner I ordered the Fish Tacos and could only eat about half of them. The flavor was lacking. I'm not sure which item it was, but something tasted funny to me. I get nervous about an odd taste in a dish with fish so I didn't finish eating. Nobody in our group that ordered tacos did end up sick so thankfully it wasn't the fish.   Dessert was cheesecake. This was okay at best. The crust was completely flavorless. The cheesecake filling was okay. It was topped with canned cherries that oddly saved it a bit.  The service was okay. Our waiter seemed distracted and maybe a little irritated. Maybe something else was going on because nobody in our group was being demanding or rude to warrant that.",

    "text": "Came here late night with my best friend and her co worker! It was literally not the first choice of dining but at 3:30-4 AM there isn't much of a choice in Mandalay Bay. The menu of course is going to be expensive because it's a hotel chain restaurant/deli or whatever. The down fall is that with it being so late they have a very selective menu to choose from so you don't really have many options! Our waiter was an airhead and we had to keep asking him for the necessary things that should've already came automatically such as napkins and water.. After spending over $60 for some basic ass meal I was completely over it because there's no way no breakfast burrito that small should've costed $13 and then the potatoes were basic with no seasoning.. My bf liked the food probably only because he was drunk but other than that I can't see myself eating here again unless I had a food and beverage credit from the hotel, but wait even then idk I would probably choose somewhere else...",

The French Onion Soup we split was excellent, very cheesy, and large portions...even split between the two of us.  I had a Tommykbocker Butthead Boch, and my GF had the Midori sour, both excellent even if the sour is a bit overpriced.  We then split the NY steak and it was very juicy, and well cooked to our medium order.  Came with fries on the plate, and if it wasn't juicy enough, the A-1 butter was really good.  A really good meal on the Strip for a high-priced seventy bucks, given the atmosphere, but not as pricy as other places in the Mandalay Bay. Well recommended, and we split on whether we would come back again.  We like variety, after all....",

He was happy to help me navigate the menu and steer me away from the ingredients I avoid. Robert M. also made sure I didn't feel like it was too much trouble to ask and was quick to joke with us.  He also helped choose wine to go with my companions meals; I don't drink but they were very happy by the time we left!",

Food: I asked the server for recommendations and he recommended the corn beef hash skillet. Since he said it was one of the popular dishes, I took his word for it and I was so disappointed when I got it. It was lukewarm and just not good, wasted my $16 on a dish I didn't even finish.   Service: Our server was nice and came promptly to take our orders and refill our waters throughout the time we were there. However, there was a situation that happened when we were paying. We asked for the server to split our bill by entrees and when he return with our change. My friend didn't her change back. We are generous but we weren't going to tip you $10 alright.  Definitely not a memorable dining experience for me in Vegas!",

I had to ask for my food to be wrapped up  to go eat in my room, as it gave me a headache 2) Stiff, not terribly friendly and inattentive service. 3) You should not have to ask for bread and butter when sitting down for dinner 4) A spoon and napkin should probably be included when you order your soup to go 5) Did I mention that the service was stiff, unfriendly and attentive? When my bill came, she dropped it ...literally...on my table, without eye contact or even a 'thanks'. There was only one other table with people in the whole restaurant...so it isn't like she was busy, either",

The \"hash browns\" came right out of the ore Ida bag in the freezer and were undercooked. Coffee was fine.

We came in around 9pm and the place was pretty much empty, but the staff (two females) wasn't very friendly, and it didn't seem like they wanted to take our order. My friend decided she wanted the Steak & Cheese Panini ($12, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizens-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=dgefLD8z6Vz861HvOIt6oA#dgefLD8z6Vz861HvOIt6oA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/citi...</a>), which was ready in 5-10 minutes. We tried to sit at the tables inside, but the staff said that area was closed, and forced us to side outside in the \"patio\" area, where the seats were not very comfortable, and where it was colder (even though we were still inside the casino). Some of the meat in the panini was still cold when we got it, since it wasn't heated evenly. However, since it looked like pre-cooked meat, we figured it would be ok, which was a terrible mistake since we all got food poisoning the next day.   DO NOT EAT HERE if you can avoid it. If it's the only place that's open, make sure that your food is cooked thoroughly. However, if you see two females behind the counter, expect some crappy service.",

I walked up, no one else in line and Ingrid and her co-worker didn't say one word at first. Not a \"hello\" or \"welcome\", just glared at me. Then after she finally decided to ask if I needed anything, I said \"I just have a question, do you have chicken fingers?\"  She seemed so bothered that she had to help me. This girl had no personality whatsoever. So I ordered two more things, and I was done with my order. I explained that I worked at Mandalay, to get my discount and she seemed even more annoyed about that. My tab was super cheap, and I asked if she got my order right, as I always spend at least $20 or more, because it was only $10. I was happy about the price, but wanted to make sure it was correct, because I had no faith in this person because of the lack of service to begin with.  So I had her repeat what I ordered, she seemed annoyed.  Wow, I can't believe that it's so inexpensive, I told her. I also told I always spend a lot more. She just didn't get it, didn't get that I was being friendly and making small talk. She said \"I gave you your discount, it's $2\". I got that I explained and was just surprised it was so cheap. She said \"I'm sorry ...\"   Why is she sorry?  No idea. It was a weird experience. I was excited about the price and that it was much lower. \"Well, it is from the kids menu\". Oh okay, got it.   Lmao. Get a personality Ingrid. And then don't continue to stair at people as they wait for their food. Then a manager with blonde hair came out and he stared at me. Did they think I was a celebrity or were they really just assholes?  Lol. Bad customer service no matter how you slice it    The food here is good, but the chicken fingers tasted either like dish soap or freezer burn. Don't get them, even for your kids.

This past Friday night though, I encountered treatment by the staff that has caused me to swear off of spending another dollar in this place.  Honestly the food is good.  the menu is not as diverse as one would hope...but that's okay because at 3 in the morning what do you expect.    What you don't expect is a counter woman who barks at you that she's not ready to take your order.  And a manager who instead of apologizing for his staff's treatment, doubles down with rude treatment of his own.    I complained to Mandalay Bay management and they comp'd my meal along with a previous one in that establishment.  That was fine.  At least Mandalay Bay knows how to treat paying customers.    Citizens Kitchen and Bar does not.  And I would just as soon pay a cab to take me someplace NOT run by The Light Group before I spent another dime in this place.    My summary.  The food was fine.  But the staff, from the manager on down, in the 24 hour take out eatery was disgustingly inept at processing customer flow and orders and took out their frustrations on the customers, probably because they are the only 24 hour eatery in Mandalay Bay and knew that they could get away with it.",

Pricey, but it's Vegas (thus the 4 stars).  Was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Sandwiches & fries done perfectly~ hot, crispy, good flavor. Had the Frisco Melt, a Reuben, Open faced roast beef with mashed potatoes. Gravy on the potatoes was a tad too salty, but the bun was garlicky delish, meats were tender & yummy. Went a couple times during our stay, and probably because of the off-hour it wasn't busy, and service was fine and attentive. Not impressed with the spinach dip & (abundance of) chips. I'd stick to the sandwiches.",

I got all my friends into the lobster roll, and we all couldn't wait to come back and get it.  I was having such a horrible weekend, and on the day I was leaving, I went to Citizens to try and make the weekend up with an amazing lobster roll, and mac & cheese. I was so excited, and was anticipating it all weekend. I looked at the menu and boom, NO lobster roll. I asked the waitress, and she said they removed it. So I left. She didn't think I was serious when I said I was leaving, lol. I'm not interested in any other dishes on the menu. You lost a very loyal customer!",

    "text": "Citizens is located within Mandalay Bay and is a great place for a low key lunch or laid back dinner. The concept is open with indoor and \"outdoor\" (walking area of hotel)seating as well as to-go options. Aesthetics could be described as a classy American diner.  When my coworker and I landed at night, we were starving and quickly decided on Citizens. I went for the French Onion Soup and a side of the Mac and Cheese. Be warned! The French Onion Soup is not meant to be an appetizer. It comes in a very large bowl and was a meal in and of itself-I'm sad to say much of it was wasted, as delicious as it was. The mac and cheese was also quite good. I also had a glass of red wine-which also came in a huge glass. Ok wine, but not worth the price tag.   Days later, when my husband and I were enjoying the pool, we were looking for food options and decided on Citizens for take out by the pool. We opted for the chicken and cheese quesadillas which came with sides of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. The portions were large once again and the quesadillas were excellent!   If you're staying within Mandalay or an MGM resort, you may charge it to your room, along with any other restaurants.",

We were greeted promptly at the hostess stand and were offered the choice of inside or patio seating. We love people watching, so we took a seat on the patio. We were quickly greeted by our server, Art, who was kind enough to take our beer and mixed drink order, brought us some waters and recommended a few appetizers.  We decided on the Spinach Dip. It arrived quickly and piping hot.  There were multiple different cheeses, an abundance of fresh tasting spinach and they had enough chips where we didn't have to worry about running out of chips with a lot of dip left (a huge pet peeve of ours). We would go out of our way to order this again.  Our dinner entrees were delicious and promptly served after our appetizer was completed. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. The manager, Andrea, even stopped by and not only asked about how our meal was, but asked us about how we were enjoying our time in Vegas and gave us a couple additional ideas of things to do. That was a nice touch. Great food, great service, we will definitely go there again next time we are in town.",

So we were walking back to our room to leave for MGM when we saw Citizens had sandwiches for sell.   We went to order at the counter. The chick at the register is super rude. I don't know what she was doing, but it didn't look like anything except looking down at something. So we waited there for her to take our order, she didn't say \"Please hold on\" or anything. She just continued looking down for 5 minutes and then finally came up and said \"What do you want?\" I asked her what's the difference between their two menus - one is an a la carte sandwich menu, and the other includes a side. I didn't feel too hungry, so I got an a la carte wich, but my bf got a sandwich plate and a side. I don't know if the girl has a hearing problem or what, but she couldn't get my bf's order right even though he didn't get anything super special or altered. Finally the meals come out, we were sitting indoors and they said we can't sit there because it's full service for people who got something with a side. Excuse me!...my bf ordered something with a side so let us sit there already. We were already exhausted from being treated so rudely by the gal taking our order, now they're saying we can't sit where we rightfully have permission to. We then asked for everything to get packaged to go so we could sit outside as they demanded.   The sandwiches themselves are decently sized but nothing special at all. Does it warrant a $13 price tag? HELL NO! I wish I could ask for our money back because this place left such a sour taste in our mouths. I got the Turkey, avocado, and sprouts sandwich. The ingredients are fresh seeming enough, but seriously nothing to write home about. My bf got the Reuben, which poorly assembled and just messy. This was the worst spent $40 of our lives. I don't know how anyone else gives this place more than 3 stars (and even that is too generous). We are paying customers, we should be treated with respect, not whatever they say is passing for service here.",

Most of the portions are large enough to split, so keep that in mind and ask your server if you are unsure. The sandwiches are tasty, we usually stop in and grab something to go to take to the pool but Thursday after we checked in we decided to eat at the restaurant. Honestly we've had way better service and the waitress had a bit of an attitude but I think she may have been a little overwhelmed with the amount of tables she was waiting on. Plus she had to deal with a few people who purchased food at the take out counter then decided it was ok to sit in the restaurant - I blame the hostess for this, neither seemed to know what they were doing. I can't remember what sandwich we ordered but we asked to split it and we each got our own fries - no split there! We also ordered the mixed green salad and the white balsamic dressing was fantastic. With the sandwich, salad and two drinks I think our bill was a little over $20. We also stopped in for breakfast one morning, the omelet was a disappointment so just skip that all together. No flavor, weird texture, not worth the $$$. My husband ordered the French Toast and that was amazing, it came with an orange flavored whip cream that was light, citrusy and paired well with the French Toast and berries.   To sum this up: 1. make the walk back from the pool and get take out. trust me you'll be happier with this then ordering food from the pool.  2. Most items can be split 3. Skip the omelet, order the French Toast",

Wait service was prompt and quick and served with a smile.  :o)",

But this is only helpful if the staff tells you that, which they don't, so...you heard it from me.  Unless you're a sumo wrestler or you typically eat 4000 calories in one sitting, split the plates two or three ways.  Food is ok, it's not bad, it's not stellar, especially by Vegas food standards, but it's ok/good & it definitely handles the job if you're hungry and hanging around the Mandalay Bay.",

He is very knowledgeable about the menu and very patient in terms of not making guests feel rushed to order.  He was very attentive and made me feel like a valued customer.    But it gets even better!  I was blown away at the attention to cleaning and sanitary work spaces as demonstrated by Erick and the Managers.  They used ph test strips on the dishwasher, and they made sure that the surfaces were all clean and neat.  I saw that they spent a good 15 minutes inspecting for a clean and sanitized bar.  That is something I haven't seen before and made me feel comfortable eating here often.  Finally, the food was delicious!  I highly recommend the cornbread and the macaroni and cheese.  I will be back often!  Erick even asked me to come back later for dessert.  Such a kind employee and a wonderful experience!",

I was a little unsure when we walked in because I couldn't tell the style of food based on the look, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had a Frisco melt style burger with fries and a cocktail. All tasted very good. The prices are typical of Vegas strip. They had a bakery style establishment next door connected that had pastry, cheesecake, etc which looked good. I would go back!",

They have a pretty extensive menu, but I came here famished and looking to try their burger.  It was pretty expensive at $18, but for Vegas I realize that is completely in line with other places. The burger itself was wonderful.  The meat was flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it.   I am not sure if they add peppers or something but it had a nice kick.  The bun was soft and pillowy - the perfect complement to the rich burger.  I usually take off the wilted lettuce and unripe tomato, but both were fresh and delicious here!  The ketchup even tasted homemade!  I really enjoyed the fries and left the restaurant a happy camper! This is a great bet if you crave top notch burger or are looking for a more casual meal on The Strip.",

They have a decent selection of breakfast items if you dine in such as omelets, oatmeal, pancakes, and waffles. Or if you choose to take out they have quick sandwiches/ wraps.   My first day here I got a kale salad to go. For $10 I got a huge salad that was enough for two meals. The kale was fresh and the pecans/ cranberries were good as well. The sweet citrus dressing a bit heavy.  The next day we dined in and I ordered the bodybuilder omelet (grilled chicken/veggie) made with egg whites. The omelet was a decent size and it came with a small serving of home fries. I also ordered the steel cut oats served with fresh fruit and brown sugar. Overall the meal was average and it's what you expect for breakfast.",

Great thing is that we were seated right away... our server Robert was decent, didn't really check in on us, but also didn't ignore us. He was attentive but that's about it.   I tried the Mahi-Mahi tacos, which were good...but it wouldn't have been my first choice. Per Robert, these were the best mahi mahi Tacos, & they weren't to me... I should have stuck to my guns and ordered the SHORT RIB lasagna! Next time. While the tacos were tasty, crunchy and loaded with toppings like pico, shredded cabbage, etc.. they weren't the best..

Despite their being a convention and normal hotel activities ongoing, in both cases we were seated immediately (I came both times with a party of 4).   We got a variety of foods during both of our visits which included artichoke dip, chicken nachos, and a the patty melt. The portions were quite large - in most cases we were unable to finish what we ordered because the portions were so large. Everything we had was really good - the artichoke dip was definitely a highlight and it was so good we got it twice!  The service was good - while the restaurant was busy the servers were generally attentive and the food came pretty quickly. Overall would recommend Citizens if you are visiting Mandalay Bay!",

    "text": "Citizens is a bogus place in Mandalay Bay. Everything as expected is extremely overpriced. This claims to be a kitchen and restaurant. It looks more like a cafeteria. There's no reason to eat here if not staying.   I can say a lot of bad things about Mandalay Bay. I will limit myself to talking about Citizens. This is an example of taking advantage of people staying in the hotel because of the convenience factor. It's a pain in the ass to leave the resort to get something to eat. Therefore you're stuck with something like this. It's also one of the few dining options in the resort that stays open late, so you don't have that many choices. The food is mostly all premade. It's in a display case. There's nothing here that isn't overpriced. It's crazy. It's $10 for a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Ridiculous but True.   It does have tables where you can actually sit and order off a menu. Just know that most of the food is still premade. The desserts come in frozen and they put them out and charge you like they make them.",

My boyfriend I decided to go downstairs and grab a midnight snack from this place (Keep in mind that it's the only restaurant open till late).   I had a spinach dip and tasted awful - no cheese at all, just mushed spinach. I ordered a hot chocolate and was completely watered down to a point that it was disgusting.   On another note, it's very expensive for the quality of food provided. I'm aware it's Las Vegas but prices shouldn't be so expensive for mediocre food.   Skip this place, not worth it!",

We ordered our food and went to sit at a nearby table waiting for our food to come out. The cashier had told me that once I get my food I need to leave because the indoor seating area is closed, then a minute after waiting another server came and told us the same thing. There were other people in line and none of them were told to leave once their food arrived, and there were even people ordering and finding a table inside. When we asked the server why we were being asked to leave we were quickly dismissed and sent off with our food with no explanation besides, \"were closed you need to leave.\"  We ended up sitting right outside of the doors where there were some tables available and watched as the employees served and waited on other customers who they allowed to sit inside. Very upsetting of the unprofessionalism and discrimination of the staff.  As for the food, I ordered the \"meat lovers\" pizza and it was average. It tasted like a quick bite with various packaged meats thrown together and heated up, nothing very high quality. There were even a few pieces of sliced deli meats on top, won't be coming back.",

    "text": "We often visit Las Vegas around the Christmas Holidays but before the New Year to take advantage of low hotel rates.  At Mandalay Bay, this benefit is offset by the fact that their upscale restaurants are closed from December 16-26.  The only restaurants open were a gastro pub, the steak house, and this - the most casual eatery that is currently called Citizen's.  We picked it because it had macaroni and cheese and was the least expensive, in a solid parent move.   I originally planned on ordering the fish and chips but a deep fryer malfunction foiled those plans. Instead, we ordered the mac and cheese side as a entree for our 4 y.o. instead of from the children's menu.  It was the first item that came out and it was a solid first impression, creamy sauce, bits of bacon, and good seasoning.    Then, my brick chicken arrived and it went downhill from there. The gravy was suspiciously brown, cafeteria style and inedibly salty.  I avoided it the whole meal which was hard to do since there was so much.  The half chicken was also quite salty on the exterior even it was prepared decently well. I appreciated the large portion of steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. Generous portions are a plus.    The other entree was a very unimpressive turkey burger, with a dry patty and a lack of sauce or spread to moisten the burger. The accompanying fat fries, however, were excellently cooked, crisp with a tender inside and makes me regretful that their fish deep fryer was down.  I didn't intend to dine here and it was a mixed bag of food. Had things not been so salty, it would have been forgetably fine rather than seared in our memories for the wrong reasons.",

She acted like I was interrupting her yet the restaurant was partially empty @ 2:30-3:00 pm.  Now CHRIS the waiter was excellent and so friendly! He was attentive and stopped several times to ask if we were ok and needing anything. I highly recommend him for a raise or more hours as he represents the hotel and restaurant come well.

    "text": "7/9: Located inside of Mandalay Bay casino. I'd rate the food a 3; good, but a bit pricey if paying without comps. The awesome service made up for it!   I had the Baconator Beef Burger and some of the Turkey Burger.   My beautiful waitress Miranda was top notch, even though the place was a bit busy for a Tuesday evening. Refills kept coming. Management had an issue with my poker room comp (I guess because Citizens is a new addition to the places that allow usage of comps). She kept checking up on the issue. While they couldn't really get it resolved, she kindly offered to take a discount off for the time being, and said that they would entirely fix the issue before closing time. A class act. THIS is customer service at its finest. Thank you Miranda! Just for the amazing service, I would definitely come back!",

I ordered a simple BLT and the bacon was super salty stale and over cooked. It was like chewing glass. Maybe if I was part of circus sideshow then I might have found it enjoyable.  And my friend got a Ruben that made them sick. And it's overpriced as well. You're better off with fast food. Heck White Castle is better than this place.  Should be called Communism instead.",

    "text": "Just got done eating here...service was horrible.  I have a lot of food allergies and sensitivities which makes eating out difficult. Most of the time I pack my own food when we go out to eat but we are on vacation and I don't have that option.  I explained to the waitress that I had a lot of restrictions and asked about the menu. She told me the turkey burger was not marinated in anything and I told her to only have them season it with salt and pepper. So I literally ordered a turkey burger on lettuce with an avocado. It took at least 20 min just to get out our  \"appetizer\" which was a small fruit bowl.  After waiting a long time we finally got our meal. No avocado...and the steamed veggies which she told me were carrots, broccoli and snap peas were half filled with zucchini which I can't have.  So I picked it all out and I started to eat the turkey burger and there was a cracked egg shell in there, I opened up the burger and there was clearly other seasonings in there as well. I told her about it and she said she would get her manager. The manager confirmed that it is premartinated and also has flour in it...which I can't have.  He offered to make me something else but with all their meat being pre-marinated I couldn't have anything. Not only that, but I was so done after waiting over an hour for this and having to get to a show we were headed to I didn't have time to wait. Will never eat here again.",

The second time, I had the potato skins. The pico de gallo as a topping choice was great. You are still paying the Vegas premium prices, but not to the extent of other places when it comes to a hearty and filling lunch, particularly when you don't want to go to a food court.",

With that being said, the service and food here is pretty good and is one of the better places to dine if you are in Mandalay Bay attending a conference, a conference where apples were sold for $5 each. The seating inside is ample and service here is friendly. They have a variety of options and their coffee is pretty good. You can check in to get a free cheesecake. We checked in one day, and redeemed our cheesecake to go as a side along with our breakfast (we are savages). I recommend the omelettes here or the skillets.",

    "text": "Eh, it's okay. It's a hit or miss.  When you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, it's late night and there's nothing else to eat, this is the only option (besides room service but I honestly think room service and this place are one in the same.)  The 3 times I had to eat here was all different, experience wise and food wise. I only utilized the take out counter, thinking that this would be the \"faster\" route but it's not necessarily.  Price wise it's all going to be pricey because you're at the Mandalay/on the strip, but again if you haven't eaten all day and you have not other options, a $16 sandwich is suddenly doable and you're at the mercy of their service. I'll sum up my review in my visits:  1st visit - Was 10pm, went in to grab a quick snack of fruit and a muffin. Really wanted ice cream but they don't serve that. Was expensive but at least service as quick as nothing needed to be prepped and there wasn't much of a line. Muffin was good, too.   2nd visit - Was about 1pm, hubby ran in to grab a reuben sandwich, not sure how long his wait was but that reuben was way too salty! Could only handle 2 bites, not a fan...  3rd visit - It was 11pm and I have no idea what was happening but it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge my husband standing there at the take out counter! My husband has the patience of a saint and saw that they were extremely understaffed but why the hell does it take the manager 15 minutes to make one espresso? The poor dude who ordered the espresso just seemed amazed at the whole process too, but you can't badger someone who's touching your food, ya know? There was people just standing there waiting to pay for a canned soda and the one of only two employees behind the counter just said, \"take it\" and waived them off.  The more annoying thing? That there was other workers in that restaurant meandering around the take out area! Come on now, help them out!   Anyways, I was ready to leave after the first 20 mins but my husband was really hungry and again, we're at the mercy of being out in BFE Mandalay at midnight. After being in there for over 30 minutes and not even having anything to show for it, I forced my husband to leave and bought him a banana and some Dibs ice cream in the sundries store to quiet his stomach until we could get a proper meal in the morning.   Thank goodness we were checking out the next day as well.",

It was Saturday night and they needed to be somewhere by 11pm at the latest. Having 12 women, getting a table ANYWHERE was nearly impossible without AT LEAST an hour wait. We were just walking around trying to find a place to take us and we asked the hostess for a menu and asked her the wait time for 12. Just then the manager, Matt, walked up and told us politely it would probably be about an hour wait. With the group not wanting to wait that long, we said thank you and started to give our menus back.   Just then he looked over at the \"closed\" lunch side of Citizen, and stopped us. He says \"You know what ladies, let me set up a table for you guys! Dont go anywhere\"   So we watched him go over to the \"closed\" side and set a table of 12 JUST FOR US!! We had a great server (and i feel horrible that I cant remember her name)   She was attentive and took care of us! EVERYONE was extremely happy with their food. It may seem like steep pricing but the portions are pretty awesome!   To make things better, he was constantly checking in on us to make sure we were being taken care of and happy with our food. He even brought to HUGE pieces of cake and ice cream for the bride to be (and the other half of the table too :) )   Thank you Matt for making our visit to your restaurant memorable and being SO accommodating!   I cant wait to eat there again on my next visit to Vegas!",

In fact, it might be the worst I've ever had.  The burger patty had no personality to it.  The rice was undercooked.  The gravy wasn't plentiful enough.  Also, it was $17.  Should have been closer to $11.  At least the over-easy egg was nice.  Overall, wouldn't go back unless it were in a pinch.",

    "text": "Attracted by the idea of comfort food done upscale brought us to Citizens hoping to find food akin to some of the similar concepts around town.  Although the decor is actually quite nice and the pastries do look tasty (we didn't sample them) we were utterly underwhelmed by the delivery.    Our server was friendly and honest( very much appreciated) and responded to our requests for suggestions very well but we got the impression our server had sampled all the offerings and was having a real struggle recommending anything to us.    I started off with a drink called American Pie (you guessed it, apple flavored) which was the best thing I had all night, right down to the ring of cinnamon around the martini glass.  We shared a spinach artichoke dip which had a sprinkle of parmesan on top.  The chips were a mixed bag of tortilla chips and pita chips.  The problem were some chips were soggy and stale tasting and some were crisp and fresh. The pita was mostly hard with a few soft bites.  The dip itself was lacking in flavor but tasted ok.    For our meal, at the server's suggestion we split an entree due to large portion size.   To our delight, the split entree was brought on two separate plates.  Some establishments do not separate it for you and I thought that was a nice touch.  However the blue cheese burger was quite disappointing.  The bun was boring, the burger dry and over cooked, and the blue cheese had no distinguishable flavor from a goat cheese.   The mac and cheese with hamhock also lacked any identifiable cheese flavor with only a light hint of a mild cheddar.  The side of fries were soggy matchstick size fries.  I expected more from an establishment in the Mandalay Bay.  There are a few interesting menu items but when we asked about them, the server hesitated to recommend them.  They do have a hangover brunch with $25 bottomless mimosas. They also have a 24 burgers in 24 minutes challenge for $40.00 unless you eat them all and then it is free.    I can't imagine I will be back unless it is just to sample a dessert.",

We had Kale Salad and Chicken Sandwich, while both were pretty good, they charged $5 each for the water bottle. We just asked for water and they charged $10 automatically without asking. It might work for one-off tourists, but I don't think that's a sustainable business practice for locals.  The food quality was not bad, thus three stars.",

My friend and I were hungry after a late night on the town, we were staying at MB and were craving burgers. We got there and were seated right away. My friend ordered the French Dip Steak and it was horrible! The meat was dryer than the Las Vegas heat, no taste! The soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting. Meanwhile I had the hamburger that had no taste to it.   Now usually if we were paying a cheap price, you get what you pay for. But these orders were $20 bucks a piece. And I understand that it's late at night, but either lower the price or give us fresh food. We let our server know that we didn't like our food (we couldn't even finish it) and didn't want anything else. Then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and \"apologized\". Yeah, whatever dude. At the end of it all we did get a cut off our total, but the whole experience was a total let down. If you're going to be serving food, all I ask is for it to be GOOD. Avoiding this place from now on.",

I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. The sandwich was huge and loaded with good veggies. I was barely able to finish two of my three tacos, as the portion was also large on my plate.  The service was sort of slow but our server was friendly. The only bummer is that, since the mini frig in the room is pre-stocked and full, we had no way to take our leftovers with us. Overall, the portions were almost too big, but the price was still reasonable, and I enjoyed the view of the restaurant courtyard area. Citzens is a good stop for a quick, simple meal.",

    "text": "24/7! One of the better 24/7 restaurants on the strip that's reasonable priced!  My group and I visited Citizens one late night after a night of drinking in the Foundation Room. Our server was so excited at first to greet us because we had a party of 6. He thought we were going to be a high value table, but his demeanor all changed when we told him we were only ordering a couple orders of those crispy piping hot waffle fries and the wonderful delectable sliders along with only waters. We only saw him once more after he brought us our food. I thought it was rude of our waiter to treat us differently only because we weren't spending as much $$$ as most tables would. It was am, we just wanted some snacks!  Despite the service snafu, the appetizers (sliders and waffle fries) were quite good. Even though we didn't order any main entrees, everything was reasonable priced. I will definitely come back to Citizens Kitchen & Bar to give their entrees a try!",

On our last visit, Greg took our order and was really cool and gave us attentive and thoughtful service.  The food was not bad and was definitely good enough for a cafe type of restaurant.  I liked the chicken soup a lot.  Iced tea is brewed which is a surprise because the buffet and Raffles both serve crappy soda fountain iced tea.  The sandwiches are filling and pretty good.  The presentation is nice and the fries are tasty.   I personally prefer the tables away from the entrance but if people watching is your thing, the front location is the best part because you can see all sorts of people coming from the clubs and the arena when there's an event going on.  It's loud and lively and good to go at 2am for some steak and eggs or other late night fare.",

The husband and I ordered a Chunky monkey drink and carrot cake. The carrot cake portion was HUGE!! That was way more than I was expecting to get but for the cost of $9, it def was a humongous heavy piece of late night cake. Was it worth $9 bucks?? Most likely not. It was moist and it was delicious but for a slice of cake, it was a little dent in my pocket for it. That cake served me as a snack and a part of my breakfast in the morning of the next day. As for the drink, it was good but also $9! The serving size for that was actually small, not worth the $9 even though the flavors were great. Peanut butter and dark chocolate flavors blended with bananas, soy and flax seeds. Tasty food but way too over priced. I get that we are in Vegas but for that price and the longggg wait for just my two items,  I am sure I can still find something  with more bang for my buck.",

They messed up my husbands sandwich initially by sending it with no mustard and on the wrong bread which delayed our meal because I didn't want to eat without him.   Overall, not bad, not great.

I will say one thing the amount of food you get for the price is decent as my sandwich was HUGE. The chicken was fried well and the buffalo sauce was pretty good. The Blue Cheese was a little strong personal preference wise (I like bleu cheese but not the amount I had on my sandwich). Even given the portion, taste and ambiance of the restaurant the one thing that stood out for me was the price sadly. Even with the amount of food you get, the taste really didn't wow me at all and I left thinking \"I paid quite a bit...\" Probably won't come back as this place wasn't that memorable for me.",

(Not a big deal, but thought I'd mention it, and they did remove the cheese from our bill.)   When the food finally did arrive, the omelette from the looks of it - was a little thin. It looked like it was made with egg substitute rather than real eggs.   Round it off with 2 (maybe) 8oz orange juices and 1 coffee the bill came out to over $40.  Conclusion: The place is okay, but a little pricey. Dimly lite like the rest of the places we've been to in Vegas so far.",

The menu is well organized and has everything to appeal to your tastes. Looking around seeing the different food coming out I was drawn to the sandwiches. I ordered the pastrami on rye with spicy mustard side of coleslaw and a Brooklyn lager. Prior to food coming out drinks were brought out fast and server kept water glass full. Once the sandwich arrived which was very quick I was welcomed with a high piled sandwich. The quality of the meat was outstanding and the bread was soft and fresh. The side of coleslaw was a light based dressing. Overall the dining experience was outstanding and will be back to try more items.",

The sandwich consists of: turkey & avocado (duh! Lol), muenster cheese, sprouts, lemon aioli, and cranberry walnut bread. Everything went so well together... One of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted! And I really don't think it was because I was a bit tipsy lol. I also got the chunky monkey smoothie. Forgot what's it in... Chocolate, banana, and other stuff I think. But it's worth trying!!",

She had exemplary customer service, and was friendly, courteous, and upbeat!  Now, on to the food -- over the course of the week I had a BLTA, Fish & Chips, Turkey Avocado, as well as the BBQ Chicken Salad.  Every meal was delicious, but be warned: portions are enormous!  So come hungry or be prepared to split a meal with someone.  For people staying at Mandalay, I would highly recommend this as a dining option!",

I thought I spotted her way back in the kitchen and I waved.  Then I realized that wasn't my waitress.    I turned around and got back to my meal.  But before I could take a bite, the waitress that I had waved to was at my table asking if I needed anything.  Dang, she wasn't even my waitress but she dropped what she was doing and hustled over to see what she could do for me.    That's just one example.  I could cite more.   All the waitstaff are like that.  Efficient, accommodating and super friendly.   This wasn't our first visit.  We've been eating here since the restaurant was called Red, White and Blue.  The name changed, but the food is still great, and the service is exemplary.  The food is a little more expensive here than the coffee shop.  Breakfasts are $17-$20.  I always get the Eggs Benedict, which is always prepared perfectly.  The Hollandaise has a subtle herb flavor that sets it apart from the typical version.  The breakfast potatoes are simple, yet delicious.  If you order anything with breakfast potatoes be sure to get a side of their sausage gravy.  It's outstanding and absolutely loaded with sausage.  My wife typically gets some sort of fresh fruit bowl.   I can verify the berries were fresh and delicious.  My nephew had the french toast, which comes topped with those same fresh berries, and it looked really good.    They serve Lavazza for their house coffee here.  They use it for their espresso beverages, too.  Good stuff!  Mikey C says: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite yo!",

I wanted a low carb option for breakfast so I stopped by to take a look at their quick to go offerings . They have pastries , salads , coffees .  I ordered a Cobb salad to go which cost about $11. It had lettuce , cubes of Swiss cheese , bacon , eggs , scallions , tomatoes . It was a decent size and the nice cashier gave me an extra ranch dressing for free . The salad looked a bit messy compared to the other ones I saw in display case but it tasted pretty good nonetheless .  The caffe latte was $5 and made to order . It was a delicious hot coffee that was made well .  I'd stop by again to try out breakfast items if I stay in this hotel again .",

    "text": "Citizens Kitchen and Bar would have gotten just 2 stars from me, but a couple of items are able to bump it up to 3 stars.  First of all, if you opt to dine in for dinner, at least the couple of times that I've gone (Sunday after 10pm), it gets really LOUD because of the band that plays just across the way.  Sometimes you just want to wind down with some good conversation, but you can't really do that with the extremely loud music playing.  If you have a headache, forget about coming here!  When we went back recently, we opted to just take our food to go.  Anyway, I like a cozy ambiance or a place with a trendy/sexy vibe; Citizens has neither.  So no problem not dining in that time.  On both of my visits, service was meh.  The hostess the time we dined in started to seat us out on their patio area closest to the live band. When we requested a quieter table inside, she sat us at a table right next to the patio making little difference in the noise level :/  There's definitely no service with a smile at Citizens, at least from my experience.  As for the food, I definitely wasn't impressed on my first visit.  I wasn't too hungry, so I opted for their french onion soup and got to taste my dining companion's penne prosciutto.  Again, meh.  Even though we weren't impressed on that visit, we went back to Citizens on a recent trip to Vegas since we were staying at the Four Seasons next door and our options were limited for late night dining.  We ordered at their to-go counter, and I chose their cheese quesadilla this time and their salted caramel parfait.  Their quesadilla I didn't care for but I did like the parfait.  I ended up coming back a few days later to pick up a blondie.  It had some toffee in it and was tasty overall and it did not disappoint!  (I forgot to take pics of the food I picked up to go.)  Overall, I would recommend Citizens for their treats at the to-go counter, or if it's late and you're not in the mood for fast food and there are no other options nearby.  Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to have a meal here.",

Walked around checking all the restaurants out and this one seemed totally casual and a good place to grab a beer, plus it had the shortest wait time.   They don't do reservations, so it's first come, first eat.    Nice decor inside, relaxing, place felt comfy and welcoming for all. Menu looked pretty good with burgers, sandwiches, salads, some signature entrees and a bonus that they serve breakfast all day. My coworkers and I ordered a round of drinks first, they too have a nice beer list, cocktails and wine list to get you going.    We decided to get some potato skins as an appetizer and it was pretty good, thick cut potato wedge with some bacon sprinkled on top and of course melty cheese on top with green onions.  You get 4 per order with guac, sour cream and pico.  We were quite hungry so we devoured it in minutes.    As for my main, I got the Mahi Tacos, 3 grilled Mahi pieces with all the normal fixin's such as pico de gallo, cabbage and avocado slices. Served with their usual friends of guac, sour cream and more pico. Fish was nicely cooked and good sized pieces and flavorful.  Anything with avocado or guacamole makes it that much better.    Forgot what my coworkers ordered but they enjoyed their first Vegas meal very much. Stayed a bit longer to have a few more drinks so no room for dessert.    Staff was fine, quite friendly, attentive and quick and helpful with making suggestions. No issues with our dining experience. If you don't want to sit in the dining room, there is a counter/walk up area where you can order to go. They are open 24/7 so this may be a good late night option before going back to your room to pass out.",

Oh the grilled cheese sandwiches also had great slices of tomato inside of them and a patty melt itself had lettuce shreds inside of it. My wife had the same thing and we both knew this flavor from something else. Then all of a sudden it hit us - - please anybody doublecheck this going forward, but this grilled cheese patty melt taste almost exactly like an In-and-Out Burger Double Double. The service was good and attentive. Oh, I almost forgot we had the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was ok. The only real complaint was that the sandwich was extremely messy to eat and hard to control. With the size this thing there's no way around it. My wife's pickle spear was huge compared to the anorexic pickle spear that I got, just sayin'.",

The quesadilla I ordered was pretty plain, I wished I had gotten more of the soup. The next night of our stay we found ourselves coming back here for a quick bite. I couldn't help but order the soup again, along with the buffalo chicken sandwich. I was disappointed that the soup didn't have nearly the same amount of cheese as the night before, though the sandwich was really great. The food is pretty expensive, but that's par for the course for a vegas resort. One strange bit is that the regular portion of soup is $14, yet the half is only $5 and is a good size.",

It was not busy at all, yet the waitress was very slow to take our order and to deliver the check.  I ordered the mushroom bleu burger, which is exactly how it sounds, a burger with bleu cheese, mushrooms, jalapeno, lettuce, onion and tomato. It is a bit pricey for a typical burger that did not stand out.  I would try this place again and try another dish with another server, but it didn't give a lasting first impression. I recommend it to hotel guests not wanting to leave the hotel, but there are other restaurants in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes including another burger joint.",

    "text": "Taking over the giant old space that was once Red, White and Blue, Citizens was designed by a 'famous' design firm for the Light group. The space is huge, and comprised of all hard surfaces; hard floors, hard ceilings, and hard walls. What this equates to is an extremely loud dining experience, even if it's not that full. The vaulted ceilings, light fixtures and finishes are all cool, but this place is just huge. I would also point out that if you want comfort, do not sit on the incorrectly proportioned backless bar chairs at the bar, and instead get yourself a table.  More importantly this place is overpriced; you'll notice that just about everything on the menu is about $2-3 more than you'd be willing to spend. I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish. Apparently the property really likes to take advantage of their massive convention crowds. With everything from breakfasts, salads, burgers, entrees and desserts you can certainly find something you'd like, just expect to pay handsomely for it. Also, they use the words 'specialty' and 'signature' quite a bit on their menu, but looking around at other people's dishes and based on my meal this definition seems to be based around providing mediocre, high priced sandwiches.  My classic hamburger was placed in front of me and looked as mediocre as it tasted. The bun was dry and a bit too big, but well-proportioned to the patty. Not sure if you have a choice of cheeses, but when I asked for a cheeseburger I wasn't offered any options and was given American cheese. The presumably frozen patty had ok char flavor, but was of your extremely generic back yard BBQ variety, and very overcooked at that. But I guess one of this quality shouldn't be ordered any other way. One small slice of not too fresh tomato didn't provide much coverage, but I had plenty of pickles, lettuce and red onion at my disposal. Overall this had nothing great going on.   My waffle fries sucked as they always do, and considering the menu gives you the option of skinny fries, potato salad or coleslaw I'm not quite sure why I got these stupid fries. They're clearly never fresh due to how they're made, so why bother? Plus, $21 for a burger and iced tea is about $9 more than you should pay for this, even in a casino setting capitalizing on desperate conventioneers. After this awful experience, combined with Burger Bar's drop off, I can probably now claim that there are no decent burger options south of Tropicana along the Strip until you get much more south away from the casinos. If you're at Mandalay I would still recommend Burger Bar over this as you get far better quality for the money, but I can't promise anything there anymore.",

They now have a juice/smoothie bar that I think everyone is still trying to get use to as it took quite some time to make a juice or a smoothie ( no matter if it was busy or empty).  Prices are a little steep but again luckily for me, I was not paying for it.  The portions are a decent size, even when you are just doing a quick takeout from the front.

His bill was like $18 for two medium drink. I took a sip and phew, it tasted like watered down peanut butter and the bitter after taste of not so ripe banana. It made my tummy rumble inside and we ended up not finishing the concert because I don't want to have any accident in there. I don't even know if its a smoothie or a juice because its not thick or icy, it's watery and tasted so bad. Not a very good first impression.

We did not do this because adding a salad and dessert isn't our thing but if you like a multi course meal this would be great for you.  The overall ambiance of this restaurant is very \"kitchenette modern\" looking. A lot of old school black and white decor and vintage addings. The dress code is business casual, however, in Vegas anything goes.   Out of all the restaurants in Mandalay bay this one has the most to offer.",

    "text": "Ate here with some friends whilst waiting for a show at the House of Blues; since parking in the Mandalay Bay either involves coming a little early and grabbing a spot next to the escalators in the parking garage or coming on time, driving around for thirty minutes as you scour every level of the monolithic parking structure trying to find a place you can only barely fit your compact car into because the rented Hummers on either side are straddling the lines, we opted to come early and have a bite while we waited. The service was fairly good, though my iced tea ran out a few times during the meal. It wasn't hugely busy, but our waiter did have several tables concurrently and I can forgive that oversight. He was still friendly and courteous. It's service that sets most any restaurant on the Strip apart, since the food is usually pretty decent but often over-priced. The food was quite good; I had the double burger that's on two grilled cheese sandwiches, which is to say that my fiance wondered whether we'd make it to the show or not when the ambulance was called. I survived by some miracle, and came out of it with a smile on my face and half the burger in a to-go box so that I could finish killing myself later after NASA got back to me with the calorie count calculation for the thing. Overall, I'd probably come back here; it was a pretty friendly little place and you got a decent amount of food for the money. Yes, the prices are higher than an off-strip restaurant, but the portions are still good.",

On the way to my room at Luxor I stopped by at Citizens.   We sat down right away and the waiter greeted us and got us drinks. He came back a few times but we weren't ready yet, but I appreciate that kind of service. When we did order I got the half chicken over mashed potatoes. The chicken was pretty good and moist and it came with a generous helping of potatoes and also a ginormous head of broccoli which was good. On top of that I ordered a side of brown rice to fill me up because eat larabars all day couldn't fill me up. The food itself was a 3.5-4 not knock your socks off but not terrible. What pulled this down to a 3 was the amount of time the food took to come out considering the place was relatively empty when we were there. I think the chef forgot our order. They actually sent out a Caesar salad to apologize so that was a nice gesture, would rather have had them discount the meal given I'm not eating the creamy dressings on salads anymore.   Hey if you need a quicker meal, you don't want to pay $80 for a salad and Le Fluer then give Citizens a shot, I'm sure the food order being overlooked isn't common and I'd change he review in the future if so.",

We ordered a Stella (I had water, boooooo), fried calamari and home mustard buffalo wings. When our food arrived, it was more than enough for two people. The wings were juicy and flavorful. The bleu cheese dressing was creamy and not tangy like some cheap substitutes. Fried calamari wasn't greasy and we ended up scarfing that down first. All in all, a good experience. So why not 5 stars? Our server went M.I.A. after he dropped our food off and getting our food to us took longer than expected for two appetizers.

The first day in Vegas I ate lunch there and they were cranking out some good late 90's and early 00's R&B tunes. My guests and I were really enjoying the music, so much that the young lady at the next table over started dancing with us. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich that day and it was good along with their fries. Others in my entourage had chicken wings (good) and their mac n cheese (which was the bomb!). The rest of our visits to Citizen's were for breakfast and let me tell you, their breakfast is bomb. Their potatoes are too die for. I'm glad I stumbled across this gym.",

    "text": "Vegas, in many, many ways, has it all wrong. Their motto should not be that it's some sort of city-wide ziplock sealing so tightly that not even vapors can escape, the metaphorically alluded-to \"municipality as black hole\". No. Their motto should be one more truthful and perhaps more pithy. That new motto of which I speak would go something like this: Nothing exceeds like excess.  And perhaps no place encapsulates that better than this place. Want to know what's in the dessert case? Well you can just walk (or waddle) yourself over there and go look. The dessert menu has five things on it (order any of these and they're huge). The dessert case has probably 5X that, but damn if they will tell you what that is. The menu itself has a number of things on it. Order any of them but appetizers and they come on a cookie sheet. This not only does wonders for the carefully crafted ambiance, but adds a flair of mystery to things. For instance, I can't begin to imagine the food waste this place must go through, but I'm betting they toss a lot more than anyone ever eats.   Actually, given the flavor, this is almost a guarantee. I can almost hear you smacking your lips right now? You mean to say we can get a bunch of substandard - and here, this word is best - \"grub\", served by some very smarmy prick who looks vaguely like Fred Arminsen, but is far from funny or even amusing (wait, maybe it is Fred Arminsen!), yet has a full-tilt condescending attitude that all but insists we should be grateful he can be deigned to bother with us mere mortals. Maybe that's it. Maybe the wait staff in this elegantly laid out pristine and serene little oasis from the flood of body odor and stale cigarette smoke isn't here for us, but rather that we're here for them. Now I know why I flew here. I wonder if it would be an insult if I tipped 150%...I'm in but I have to get back out somehow.  Then again, it's a great deal, if you get a lot, right? It may be expensive, but at least it's mediocre! Expensive is the nature of the biz in Vegas and comes with the territory and so, apparently, does throwing any old thing in front of people.  This place clearly doesn't care about patrons coming in and out and is one of the more jaded places I've seen. Maybe they ought to just throw all in and go for \"Citizen\" by way of the old Soviet Union. I'm thinking a food line with metal bowls and plates. The only thing served will be potato soup with cabbage and garlic, along with a small roll that may or may not be moldy. Drink choices are cheap vodka or brackish water. If nothing else, it would at least accurately mirror the contempt for the customers this place clearly seems to have.  Also, like everything else in Vegas, this place is loud.",

    "text": "Citizens Kitchen & Bar is located inside the Mandalay Bay hotel. They offer the typical American fare. The interesting thing about this place that I did not know at first is that they have an actual restaurant and they also have a to-go area where all of the salads and sandwiches are basically pre-made and ready to be sold. I came here twice on my most recent visit and ate once at the restaurant and I also got some food to-go the other time.  When I did eat at the restaurant, the service was great. The host was very nice and so was the server. The manager even stopped by to ask how my meal was going. They definitely take customer service seriously here which is a good thing!  Food: Chicken Cobb Salad- Chicken, cheese, egg, cucumber, tomato and bacon. The salad was pretty good and refreshing. They also give you a choice of what dressing you want, but I stuck with the typical cobb salad dressing which is bleu cheese. $18  Turkey Avocado- Turkey, cheese, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, avocado, lemon aioli on a cranberry walnut bread. A really good sandwich for the most part. It tasted really healthy which is good since I always eat the worst food while I'm in Vegas. $18  French Dip Steak- Thin sliced prime rib, caramelized onions, provolone cheese and au jus. Served with cole slaw and a pickle. This was probably one of the best tasting French dips that I've had. Towards the end it started to be a little on the salty side, but overall I thought it was a delicious sandwich. $19  Typically, I would probably lower it to 3 stars since the prices are pretty high for the amount of food, but it is Vegas and nothing in Vegas is cheap. I've spent over $10 on a lousy piece of pizza before so I'd rather spend $20+ on a delicious sandwich! I would definitely recommend Citizens Kitchen & Bar to anyone that is at the Mandalay Bay and is looking for your typical American food.",

It's usually packed even on a week night, but there was a convention in town so that may have added to it. Place is quiet and quaint compared the crazy casino, bar, and rock band stage that is blaring outside. The touchscreen menu outside said they had hamburgers but I guess there grill was broken, kind of disappointing because the burgers are the reason we came in. Anyway I got a plate of a dozen wings, my girl got a plate of wings and I got two beers $70!. I know Vegas is expensive so I guess it is what it is. My girlfriend and I both weren't able to finish our food, maybe because we really didn't want wings or because we weren't that hungry, so I guess one plate would have done for both of us.",

After 33 minutes our extremely simple to-go order is still not ready and there are at least 4 workers behind the counter that I can see, possibly more in the back. Our friends went to the food court and already ate their food and came back to see why we're still here. Not convenient at all and the food I can see in the glass case at the counter looks exactly like your standard, overpriced airport to-go food in plastic boxes. Not holding out hope that anything we ordered is going to taste better than average. Not ever coming back here. Spend your vacation dollars elsewhere.",

So I went straight to Citizens before check-in at the hotel. I sat at the bar and enjoyed the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a cold Bud Light. The sandwich was big, and it hit the spot. The Buffalo sauce was tangy and it was neutralized nicely by the ranch dressing. The chicken breast was thin and fried just right. The side of fries was on point. They were hot and crispy.",

    "text": "O my goodness gratuitous I am and was incredibly disappointed by the way this place is managed and run. Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way, almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks, she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away. Will definitley tell everyone I know that is going to Vegas (specificly Mandalay Bay) to avoid this place like the plague.",

So, we ate it.  I don't mean it wasn't hot.  I mean the little balls of butter wouldn't melt on anything.  Not my hubby's pancakes, not my toast, not the hash-browns!  Also, know how I am when I was hungry so I didn't say anything, not that I was even asked how things were. Tim ignored us until he brought the check.

This place is set up like a diner but the menu items have high-end prices. Any entree cost anywhere from between $40-$60. It's located conveniently next to the club Light so you go at 4AM you will see a lot of drunk, post-clubbers (like me).   I ordered a filet mignon and fries which was around $58 (another high/low thing). The steak fries were delicious! Nothing better than some comfort food after drinking! The filet mignon was very tender and juicy too, but for some reason I filled up on the fries. I found it a bit hilarious that the filet mignon came with fries instead of mashed potatoes or creamed corn like traditional steakhouses, but, hey, that's Vegas for ya.   Overall the environment of the restaurant was not that memorable, but the food was pretty decent. I did find it rather funny that this place looked so casual but the menu items would be something that an upscale (okay, at least business casual) restaurant would serve. I would probably end up here again if I went to Light, but not something I would go out of my way for. Plus, it's also rather pricey considering what you get, but that's Vegas *shrugs*.  The service was pretty good too. I don't have any memorable stories, but my other friends actually came here as well and saw me eating with someone and told the waitress that they were going to leave because they saw someone they knew. The waitress replied, \"Don't worry, I'll hide you.\"  That's top notch service right there!  Yelp should really do half stars. I would give this place 3.5 stars but I rounded down to 3 because I was less than impressed with the decor.",

My drink was peach iced tea with whiskey and it was excellent.   One note we went into the restaurant and not just the counter.",

I found the prices to be reasonable for a Vegas restaurant, people can't expect to eat at Denny's prices in Vegas in a higher end hotel. Even Starbucks charges double the price in the hotel. We ordered the chicken sandwich (excellent and fresh), Caesars salad (just enough dressing),  chicken fingers, buffalo wings, and nachos( it was a huge platter). All the portions were huge and was just yummy, if your kids aren't big eaters they could easily share a platter. I recommended this place to a friend and they loved it also. Our server was Lerani and she was so nice and just a great server, I would ask for her if I was to go back. This for sure will be a place for us to eat at when we stay at the Mandalay or Delano.",

    "text": "I was staying at the Mandalay Bay for a conference so I came here quite a few times during the week. It was one of the closest food spots next to the conference rooms. It also was one of the few full menu places in Mandalay that stayed open late. Surprisingly most of the food spots shut down at around midnight.   Citizens was a bit of a hit and miss. Two of the four times I came it was great. The other two were just ok. I liked that they had 3 sections (bar, restaurant and counter). The counter was a quick line that basically had sandwich, salad, coffee and other quick items available for immediate purchase. This was convenient for conference breaks as I was able to just run over, grab some pre-made foods and coffee before heading back. The restaurant and bar were nice for late night dinners. We came here twice to eat at the restaurant portion. The food was ok. The only thing I ordered here that I hated was the mixed green salad. The leaves were very bitter and the dressing was sub-par. Most of the other dishes we ordered were good, but nothing stood out as extraordinary.   Everything here was overpriced. As I mentioned it's a convenient spot and it's open late so they're able to get away with the prices... But don't expect the quality to match the price.  The service was on and off. We had one server who was great. The barista and employees behind the counter were also good. But we also had a server who was terrible. But overall it had decent service.    The number one thing this place has going for them is the convenience of location and hours.",

First, I thought this was absolutely ridiculous to not be able to make a quesadilla and secondly I felt they should have called to inform us before we waited and walked down, because after 30 minutes we had to reorder and wait again. The man appearing to be the manager didn't speak to us at all and appeared very unfriendly to the guests and not helpful to the 2 young girls working behind the counter. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the chocolate cake was phenomenal but the pizza was discussing and the service is a joke.",

I had the fried calamari, French onion soup, Caesar salad, and steak frites -- to go. It was packed perfectly for me to take back to my room.  The calamari was tasty and lightly beaded. It was great even without the two sauces it comes with - cocktail and Thai chili. The salad was crisp and as fresh as you'd expect with a couple of large croutons. The French onion soup was savory with shredded onions and a layer of gooey cheese. No croutons in the soup and it was on the slightly sweeter side. The steak itself was good. I ordered it medium and it was a full 16oz steak. The fruit bowl was a nice way to finish it all off.  Service was fast but the wait for the food was over 20 minutes. *sigh* Pricey too but what else are you going to eat at this hour on Christmas day?",

I wish I did because I'm sure you can mess up Rice Krispies as bad as those \"honey mustard wings\" they were soggy as hell. Spent 60 dollars on wings, a pizza and a tuna salad sandwich. Over priced and overrated. 3 Stars is too kind. I had to take 5 Imodium to keep from losing my colon once I got back to my room. Should have stopped at Sonic on the way back to the hotel instead. Would have been a better value and a better meal. They're tater tots are gourmet compared to this slop. Blech, don't do this to your stomach after all you only have one!",

A full service bar is open to the dining area and offers a huge selection of beers. Decor is a bit industrial with touches of muted metals, antique mirrors, weave pattern tiled floors and banquettes with leather seats and straps. It's loud and fun with a cool hip vibe, and service is casual. Open 24 hours 7 days a week, the menu is classic American fare meets local diner style favorites (breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night staples are offered). We started with the Artichoke Dip - very good except the chips were a mix of tortilla and pita. The pita chips were way too thick. For dinner we all ordered something different - Toasted Reuben (yum) comes with fries, macaroni salad or coleslaw; Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos (3 pcs); Brick Chicken (half chicken, garlic mash, broccoli) and Spaghetti Bolognese. Portion sizes are smaller than what you would expect for the price you pay, but then again, this is at the Mandalay Bay so I guess they can charge $25 for spaghetti and $24 for 3 tacos.",

Unfortunately, our waiter (also was the bar person) was what prevented me from providing a 5 star review.  Food, which I had a chicken Caesar salad and pretzel bites, came in great portions and had a great quality to it.  Salad had a perfect amount of dressing too I must add.  My friend had the nachos and we would never have guessed they would be a mountain of nachos.  Leftovers were taken home.  Our waiter who was the bar person did move with urgency, but after we had ordered, his attention seemed to grow less patient with us and he engaged with us much less than everyone else around us. This was most noticeable when asking to box up the leftovers. He made a comment to boxing the nachos that seemed to imply he didn't want to waste his time if we were not going to take it home.  His facial expression and tone made it seem like we were going to waste his time by asking to box the nachos.  Even the gentleman sitting next to us caught wind of it and was slightly put off by the remark.  Do not get me wrong, this bartender was incredibly nice and respectful everywhere else, it was just this interaction that really left a lasting impression.  Perhaps next time I'll just stick to the regular dining experience with the waiters and waitresses.",

Cheeseburger- $20: please see the picture I posted. More lettuce than hamburger. Bun was over-toasted and hard. Burger patty was once again very bland. I had to ask for mayo to just give it some taste.  Only positive was the french fries, which were   Service- hostess was very friendly, server was average for a late-night diner sort of place, however he brought me the wrong bill. I was one of only 3 tables currently occupied.   Summary: Hands down worst food I've had in a while. I have never given a 1-star rating before,. In fact, I would happily go to a Denny's everyday of the week over here, and also for half the price. $38.97 pre-tip, even on the strip was a complete waste for the quality of food.   I sincerely hope the F&B department @ Mandalay Bay takes time to read these reviews. Honestly, just a little effort would go a long way at this establishment. Just because this is a 24/7 eatery, does not mean that everyone who eats here late at night is intoxicated and would scarf down whatever is put in front of them.",

Food is overpriced and subpar but it was not a surprise. My friend asked if it was possible to get bolognese for her 10 months old. The waitress didn't even blink to tell her \"we don't do that\". We then asked another waiter for it and then our waitress came out again that she spoke to the chef and he agreed to make a one time exception and prepare a small portion of it but that it will be $7. We didn't care about that - she could have/should have said that from the beginning. Then, after a lifetime the famous order came out and it was super spicy. It was for a 10 month old. We haven't touched it - but of course we were charged and we paid the $7. We took it home and it ended up in the trash.  Overall, I would give 2 stars for the food - nothing special, overpriced, and over cooked, but edible, and 1 for service. There's nothing more annoying than not getting any service when dining.

You may be tempted to eat here because you are drunk and it is open, but don't. Do yourself a favor and save yourself some money and get  Uber eats or grub hub or door dash to deliver you food from literally anywhere else. You will get better food from Denny's.

We could make it with lettuce Me: I'll have it with no lettuce Employee: On sourdough or wheat? Me: The menu says it's on ciabatta Employee: we're out of ciabatta Me: okay, I'll have the roast beef sandwich on sourdough. Can you make that warmed up? Employee (bewildered): No, we can't warm sandwiches up. Me: okay, fine It took about five minutes for her to make the sandwich. During that time, several potential customers walked in, waited, and left because their presence was not acknowledged. At least twice, she had to go back to the (presumably) shared kitchen of the take-out counter and sit-down hot food restaurant to find ingredients.  I got the roast beef sandwich, a bag of chips and a water for $23 dollars. It was a cold sandwich on cold bread with cold cheese with overwhelmingly hot horseradish sauce (and I like spice). Just a crappy sandwich. I'm not even asking for a panini press, just microwave that SOB for a minute.  It would not take much effort for this restaurant to make better food and no effort at all to provide better customer service.",

From sandwiches to salads, vegetarian to meat-lover, appetizer to entre, it works for everyone!   I love their kale and brown rice salad! You can add salmon or another protein to it (well-done salmon is my spirit animal!) and you're solid! Their artichoke and spinach dip isn't too creamy and packs a perfect punch for small bites everyone can share.   Their wine and craft beer selection is just right along with having cocktails that fit the happy hour vibe.  As with most places on the strip, the service is under par which is my reason for not rating this place higher.

Our waitress Lotus was very friendly and and checked up on us frequently despite being very busy. Although, it was a sit in type of restaurant, the menu was very slim. It was basically a card, no bigger than a greeting card with less 10 options. All sandwiches, hand burgers and breakfast burritos.   My wife ordered the breakfast burritos which came with nacho chips. The chips arrived warm, hinting they were freshly made. The burrito was filling for my starving wife and she could only eat half of it. I ordered the egg and ham croissant. It was good. But it arrived warm cold at best like it was sitting for about 15-20 minutes. The potatoes squares that it came with was cold. It was sitting for at least 30 minutes are more. I couldn't even finish it.   They were pretty busy at the time, I'll give them that. But, it also got them a 3 Star at best. Would I try them again, probably not anytime soon.",

My entire interaction with her was as if I was bothering her.  Usually, I'm able to ignore rude interactions but when I asked her if it's possible to warm up my purchased pastry instead of a simple apology and explanation I receive a sharp aggressive response.    I'm unsure if it's truly a policy thing or if she did not want to do her job.  It's very questionable when there's a toaster oven right behind the counter.",

    "text": "This place is conveniently located in the Mandalay Bay basement shopping area. We came here specifically looking for healthier options, so we tried their fruit salad, Caesar salad, mixed green salad, and quinoa salad with seasonable vegetables. The salads have extremely fresh ingredients, which is great. But what I love about this place is that each piece of lettuce and ingredient is generously drizzled with the dressing, yet the taste is quite balanced and not overpowering. The decor of the restaurant is also nice and clean, which helps with the appetite for certain. For those that want to easily bring food to go, Citizens offers many easy to-go options right at entrance, which you can just pay, go, and enjoy!",

They have a really good spot and the restaurant itself looks really nice but with the mediocre food, overpriced menu, and ok service (waitress got our order wrong, she didn't write anything down) it is definitely not worth it. I suggest you take the extra steps and probably look for food outside the hotel.",

The music was so loud that we literally could not be heard by each other or the manager - who stopped by the table to check on us. He asked how our experience was and if he could do anything to improve it. We asked for them to lower the volume of the music. He replied \"What?\" because he literally couldn't hear us shouting.   During dinner, in which we both donned earplugs and entertained ourselves with our phones, my boyfriend downloaded a decibel meter onto his phone, and found that the ambient sound level peaked at 97db.  I honestly feel so sorry for the staff who's forced to endure the noise in this establishment.   The food was fine. The service was minimal. Our server had two huge tables in addition to a number of four tops, and was super overworked. She was doing her best, but it was clear we were on our own. We saw her twice during the whole meal.   Avoid, unless you want to hurt your ears.",

Chicken Soup $10.00:  Ever had a $10 soup?  I have.  I believe one was a farm-to-table asparagus wonderland of flavors.  And I've had some others at various ultra-high-end restaurants, most of which very special and very delicious.  But... diluted canned chicken soup with some extra vegetables and spaghetti thrown in?  Seriously?--ten bucks!?  1/10  2. Frisco Melt $16.00 \"sourdough, grilled onions, swiss, thousand island dressing\":  And if the chicken soup didn't blow your brains, well, here we have a burger for $16... how do they top the ten dolla' canned soup with spaghetti?--with multi-day-old leftover over-cooked cardboard cheap frozen patties.  I couldn't eat it.  Took 3 bites and threw the rest away.  1/10  I dunno, maybe if you're high and couldn't make it to White Castle?...  Otherwise, just turn around.  Just don't.  1/5  PS--It appears the manager left a comment to this review with her email.  I want to note that I did in fact write her an email, but am still waiting on a response.

The \"Ultimate Sliders Challenge\" (24 Sliders in 24 Minutes) looked interesting. Seems like a whole lotta mini-burgers to choke down in not a lotta time. Impossible for many and conquered by few. $40 Challenge declined.  Hearty plates. We tried a couple dishes which were decent to share or sample. Rather pricey, though, for mostly standard fare IMO. Relatively spendy menu prices aren't exactly budget friendly because Vegas, but the food should fill nicely whether before or after your bender. There are bargains to be found if you're motivated to pinch pennies elsewhere.  -$21 Fish tacos. Nicely battered fish and not oily/greasy. Fresh veggie mix and soft tortillas. Good, but not so much 21 dollars great. Southern California is still tops for best fish tacos and value priced to match. -$18 Corned beef pastrami sandwich. A nice stack of toasty, melty, meaty, deli goodness that even a New Yorker might appreciate. The consensus winner from our table. The cole slaw side was ok, but probably should've gone with the fries. -$18 Bacon cheeseburger. Three slices of fine bacon makes for a tasty cheeseburger and the fries were served hot and crispy. Now we need some luck at the tables to recoup the steeply marked up lunch tab.  Service was friendly and efficient. Drinks were refilled regularly. All good there.  There are several restaurant options conveniently located within the Mandalay labyrinth to keep you intrigued, and Citizens Kitchen & Bar is a 24hr accessible spot with familiar fare to satisfy.",

Service wasn't the quickest, but the overall experience would be hard to beat. It took us about 45 minutes from being seated to leaving the restaurant. My husband and I decided to split the ultimate breakfast and we ordered an extra side of sausage to make sure there would be enough food. We were pleasantly surprised when our breakfast came pre-split for us, with way more food than we expected! Each of us were given a huge plate with one egg each, 2 pancakes, 2 slices of bacon, and breakfast potatoes. It was exactly what we were wanting and didn't even have to ask. We felt like we got much more food than had they just left it all on one plate. It was a simple breakfast that was the perfect way to split between a couple, all for the price of the regular menu item. We will definitely be back for breakfast here and add it to our list of regular restaurants on our Vegas cycle!",

Who trained and supervises the staff here? ** UPDATE 2/10/14 ** Within a few days both the bartender and GM wrote to me directly with their sincere apologies and regrets for this lapse in service. While you would expect this of the GM, for the bartender to do this independently is a very stand up thing to do.  Both showed integrity and pride in their work in doing so.

Ordered a small size of the kale salad which was inedible and pretty sure against FDA regulations as it seemed it was kept unrefrigerated. Then I ordered a $10 \"juice\" that  was actually a smoothie. I'll give them points for using actual free fruits, but being from LA, I am very particular on my freshly PRESSED juice.   NEVER AGAIN. Go to the little mini mart near the elevator and buy some cup of noodles there to satisfy your late night drunk munchies. Although there's no coffeemaker in the rooms at Mandalay, so ask for a cup of hot water from starbucks or citizens (they'll charge you $1)",

The waiter was great, very attentive and at one point seemed like he was going to sit down with us to tell us about every item on the menu - maybe he was new.  The first hint was during a conference with 30,000 people this place had tons of open tables.  Food was not so great at dinner - ribs were not great, wings were not great, rice bowl was not great, fries were not great, get the picture?  I guess it's better for breakfast in the AM but there isn't much else open either at that time of day.  Bar looked well stocked, I will give them that.  Pricey for what it was, I think the hotel should tear this out and make a bigger Starbucks, they would have happier customers.  Sorry, go in for a drink or coffee and you'll be fine - avoid the food.",

A friend remembered having a good experience here so we figured it should be pretty good. Well, it fell a little short of the mark with pricey food and slow service. My tuna melt was good, but it better damn well be for $16! The accompanying seasoned criss-cut fries were a tad overdone, making them overly crunchy. The service was nice but slow; it seemed like it took forever for the food to come out and we were HUNGRY. It was crowded, to be sure, with 4th of July weekend and the MMA fights and all, but it seemed like they should've anticipated this and staffed appropriately. Not a special destination in my book.",

We arrived and there was a 5 minute wait, not bad, we did get seated within that 5 minutes. Once seated it was about another 10 minutes before our waitress, who was very nice, came over and asked us what we wanted to drink, by then we were also ready to order. I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich and my husband eggs over medium, sausage, potatoes and sourdough.  We got our food on about 20 minutes. Mine was ok, just your basic breakfast sandwich. Their potatoes though wow, it's like the cap was loose on the paprika bottle and someone dropped it in the frying pan. I like paprika, but this was overkill. My husband on the other hand. Well let's just say I felt really bad because I picked the place. His eggs were not over medium they looked like hard frisbees with brown crispy outer edges like someone forgot them on the grill. You know what else they forgot was cooking? The toast? Yeah it came out served burnt. I am shocked they would send that out to a table. His sausage came in the form of bacon.  They left our plates so quickly it took a while fir him to get someone's attention to let them know he had ordered sausage. When he finally did, they brought him a side of sausage. He should have kept his mouth shut, because unlike the eggs and toast these were not over cooked. He cut them open and they were mushy and pink. So maybe breakfast isn't their thing here, maybe they need to hire more people, maybe it was just an off day. Anyhow, I don't think I will be back after that experience.",

    "text": "Ugh! I only went here a second time (on a separate Vegas trip) because my group was starved and drunk... and couldn't walk another hundred feet to another restaurant or something ridiculous....  I can't remember.  BUT I CAN REMEMBER HOW SHITTY BOTH MY VISITS HERE WERE! The first time, I ordered a pretty basic burger that ended up coming to the table late and undercooked.  While I would typically eat it if it was anything else (my standards of food are pretty low), I would probably have yakked it out if I decided to eat it.  I asked for it to be recooked, but the waiter was pretty unresponsive about me getting a new one, so I didn't even end up eating it as my group was in a rush.  I gave up and decided to never come back again....  But I did, several months later.  This time, our group was much bigger (about 10) so understandably, it would take a while to get our food.  However, we were there for maybe a half hour-45 AFTER ordering and our waitress passed by our table once, only after we all spent time staring at her from across the room.  Finally got the food and it was cold as Antarctica.  Wow! It's like they cooked it on time but left it on the counter to hang out or something.  Some people at my table refused to eat most of their food so I asked (shamelessly) if they \"were gonna eat that\" so I could doggy bag it.  Even the boxes took some effort to acquire.  I was determined to salvage as much as I could from this experience and never return again!    Oh, 24 hr Vegas McDonald's.  I will never forsake you again.",

Lotus ( i will never forget this name. I mean how can you? ) was our server. She was professional and had a great personality and funny at the same time. She made us laugh GOOD at least 3 times. Lol. She helped us navigate through the menu and recommended her favorite bottle of of wine. It was spot on!! We then asked her to get us some munchies and said we trusted her. She got us some calamari, artichoke dip and potato skins. AGAIN SPOT ON!! They were all delish. She finished us off with a carrot cake to share ( it's HUGE) and some coffee. After chitchatting and winding down for abt 2 HOURS, we were all refreshed and left to walk some more. Great food and awesome service. Thanks for awesome experience to citizens and Lotus! I will definitely be back :)",

    "text": "Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.  Ate here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service.   The breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like \"diner plus\" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \"signature\" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good.",

Given that it was Vegas, everything was overpriced. That is fine if the food was somewhat good but it wasn't. The food was mediocre at best, and nothing that I would rant or rave about. I was hoping and expecting better given that it was inside Mandalay Bay but that was wishful thinking on my end.   When we walked in, it was pretty empty and only a few seats were taken. It took an awful long time for our waiter to get to us. For what reasons I do not know. Still, he took his sweet time, and once he took our order disappeared until it was time for our food to come out. Still no drinks and still no silverware. We had to remind the waiter when our food came out at which time he went and got it. It would be hard to understand a place like this inside a huge casino would have service like this when busy but when not busy blows my mind.   It was good that my buddy and I tried this place. But many of the other restaurants we ate at Mandalay Bay were much better.   Good place to try but nothing so special I would want or recommend coming back to.",

Their berry bowl is large and comes with raspberries and strawberries!  Their to go line moves pretty quickly- I usually would pick up a croissant and some fruit.

We had three different people tend to us and that made it confusing for the tip amount. The food was high priced for the portion as well. I usually never finish a meal and today I ate all of my food because there was barely any on my plate. So if you do go here expect to pay more for less.

I pointed this out to the server who asked if I wanted him to take it back and get something else instead. I sent it back as inedible and I was not happy that they tried passing of the $2 canned stuff as their own. I got the eggs benedict which was mediocre but not terrible. I was then billed for both items when I asked about this they were not willing to correct it and said that they had to make both dishes it is not their fault I am not happy with their food.

We felt like we were sitting on top of our neighbors, when there were at least 3 other open tables nearby that weren't jammed top of anyone else.   We waited for 10 minutes with no greeting by anyone. We finally just cut our losses and walked out, figuring that if our experience was that bad already, it wasn't worth waiting to see how bad it could get.",

The bread was toasted well, light and very crispy.  The corned beef was generous and tasty.  The thousand island dressing, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese together made the sandwich awesome.  Cole slaw on the side complimented the sandwich.  Excellent!  Loved this place so I came back in the evening and had their popular French onion soup and a side salad.  The soup tasted like heaven and portions were generous.  3 different types of cheeses, thick and gooey, covered slivers of soft sweet onions chunks of bread soaked in the soup...It was the first time that I couldn't finish my soup!",

Was it incompetence or flawed marketing? No one will ever know, and perhaps we're better for that fact.  How was the food? I didn't wait to find out. If their front of house management is any indication then the food is inedible and will needlessly take 20 minutes to find your table. Honestly, it's Vegas. There are restaurants everywhere and most of them won't punish you the way Citizens does for attempting to give then your money.",

I visited here twice during my stay, both times only using the counter service. The first time was late night for dessert. It took about 20 minutes for them to box up 2 pieces of cake and deliver them from the kitchen. That seems a little excessive to me. Good thing they quickly made me a tasty decaf mocha to sip on while waiting.  The second time for breakfast. It is nice to have healthy options, so I indulged in a fresh made juice and a breakfast sandwich. Juice was good (I would hope so for $9!) and the sandwich was just ok as it was warmed in the microwave. We waited again about 20 minutes for the juice and the sandwich.  On a previous stay, we have had sit down service. The food was pretty good, nothing stellar.   I will be back because it is the only place to grab and go with decent food any time of the day you are ready to nosh without wanting to leave the hotel.",

Unfortunately, the main ingredient was apple juice with honey running a close second. Yuck.  The last straw was when after waiting for 10 minutes at a nearby table (for the juice), we were told we had to move because the table was for non-\"to-go\" guests. The place was empty and we would have stayed exactly 5 minutes since we were running so late already. Horrible experience.",

However, Sat morning 3/5/16 my fiance and I went to Citizen for breakfast after grabbing a cup of Java at Starbucks.  As we approached the young blonde woman who was the hostess, I immediately saw the sour look on her face.  She was leaning on her elbow and was either in a bad mood or had a terrible hangover. I stood by and waited for her to look my way so I could make my request.  Mind you there was only one other guy waiting to get in. After waiting a minute with no acknowledgement,  I walked all the way up to her, and said excuse me, but we'd like to have breakfast.  She looked at me like I kicked her buns, then said just two of you?.  I said yes, and thank you. She said sternly, stand close!  I shrugged her attitude off and we checked out the posted breakfast menu.  Then she smugly told us,\" I'm sorry, but no outside drinks are allowed you'll have to throw it away\". That was before she even planned on seating us. At that point I told her to forget it, and we would go elsewhere. Round 2... We returned for dinner, and it was like night n day.  The young brunette woman greeted us warmly, and sat us within 10 mins.  The waitress was excellent as was the food.  I'm giving this a 3 star but would give it 5 had that first employee not ruined my morning .. Management should do random attitude checks to improve their customer's experience. Their Mac n cheese and mahi tacos were outstanding.",

The food is excellent, we have eaten at least one meal a day at Citizens for the last week and plan on continuing the streak until we leave next week. The staff is incredibly helpful, personable and professional. In particular, we've had exemplary service from Cory, Cady, Justin and especially Brianda, they have all gone above and beyond in being helpful and attentive. (I know I've forgotten some names that also deserve a mention.... sorry). Favorites: Corned beef reuben, French onion soup, open-face Prime Rib sandwich, Carrot cake So-so: Pastrami sandwich - too crisp for my taste (management promptly took it off our bill and offered a replacement free of charge.)

Now I know why many people left bad review toward horrible/rude customer service and managers. When the good service comes along with the good food, then it makes the restaurant good.  Menu: I think this place has good selections from sandwiches to good soup menus. But I have no idea how the taste are because I had to return the food. I bet the overall quality and taste decent by reading other people's reviews.  Price: Pretty high as a quick bite casual place. Of course, this is in Vegas. But Wynn has much better casual restaurants with the same price level.  Service: If you are planning to order something over the counter, don't expect to get treated nicely. Just think you are at the local $3 burger shop, but the price is 5 times higher. First, the cashier / hostess at the counter, is not professional (I don't think they are rude. It seems like they just didn't get trained enough about how to serve customers politely).  The worst part is the manager, who is even worse. This place's manager (Mike) is the RUDEST manager I have ever met in my life. I saw another bad review about this place's manger, now I know why. if you have any issue with this place, don't even try to make it fixed with a manager, cuz it will make you look like you are the one with the problem. And don't try to explain what went wrong with your order, because the manage won't listen you.  If you don't care about the service, this place is good to go.",

    "text": "It is mind numbing to realize that an operation like Mandalay Bay could invest so much into their Foodservice program yet deliver such an inferior product. There was really nothing good about this dining experience. Let's start with the waiter, \"Erick\".  Someone needs to explain to him that good customer service does not include a phony, smarmy attitude. Erick didn't seem to comprehend that when a customer has an issue, he needs to respond, not just give lip service. Citizen's Kitchen is supposed to offer comfort food. But it isn't comfortable on any level. After I was seated, it took Erick quite a while to approach. I ordered the potato skins appetizer and the BLT & A sandwich. It took forever for the appetizer to be brought to the table. The potato skins looked great, but were cut so thick that the potato remained raw and hard. Difficult to eat and cold and bland. To make matters worse, the sandwich came out within two minutes of the appetizer, forcing me to try and quickly eat the appetizers so I could get to the sandwich and fries before they turned cold. When I mentioned this to Erick, I got a blank stare and an apology. But no action. Sure enough, by the time I got done with the appetizer, the sandwich and fries were cold and hard. Again, Erick didn't seem able to comprehend why this was an issue. No action. Eventually the manager \"PJ\" came by and I asked him why they served appetizers and entrees together. He stated they didn't. I explained my situation. He apologized and offered to correct the situation. But by that time, it was too late. Raw potato skins and cold BLT aren't a great meal. In fairness, PJ did take 10% off my bill. But I'd rather have a good meal than a discount. If you like mediocre food, bad service and \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" blasting in your face, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, avoid it if you can.",

We tried to go here twice. The first time was around midnight. The place was empty and I asked for another table so my sweetheart and I could sit side by side. There were probably 40 tables available. The hostess told me in an extra snotty manner that they are a 24 hour restaurant so they will need the four top table for another party. My sweetheart was offended by how she addressed me and suggested we leave immediately which we did. I should not have returned.   The second time we returned I tried a side of mac and cheese and the French onion soup. The soup was meh. The mac and cheese was cold as if they didn't microwave it long enough. It was definitely microwaved. They were out of carrot cake. It was super super expensive- around $30 for one person. It was really really loud and hard to talk. Don't go here at all. There is no reason to. There are other places to eat like Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian which are open 24/7 who won't be rude while overcharging you for bad food.",
