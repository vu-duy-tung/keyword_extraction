    "text": "My team and I were trolling the strip looking for a place to eat. We decided that a burger would be simple and ideal. We found this French themed burger place inside of the Paris hotel and thought it should be good.  When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said \"seat yourselves\"  We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.  He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes. We finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip.   When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the \"Perfect Pour.\" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.    I ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time.   It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.   I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.  I would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here. There is a Fatburger right down the strip and is worth the extra time/distance walking.",

Yes, they delivered paid drinks before free drinks. That's how they roll. The guy blamed his bus boy. Way to rip on the place you work.  Food came out around 10:20pm. Honestly, the food was decent. I enjoyed every bite of my L'American burger and fries. When he dropped it off, the wiater said \"I'll be right back with more waters.\" They never came.  An older couple next to us complained to the same wiater about wait times and asked for a full refund on their check. He got a manager and they talked for a bit and got their refund. We didn't want to be a harsh because the waiter is just doing his job. It's the managers fault for overbooking the place.  We straight up told him we didn't want to tip because of the awful experience, but that we'd pay for the great food.  If they're busy, don't eat here. If they add you to a list to be seated, go somewhere else. If they're quiet inside then I'd recommend the food. We expected to be in and out withing 30-45 mins to get our night on in Vegas. Instead we spent over an hour and a half complaining about everything going on around us, from the waiters conversing when people are waiting to big parties getting \"VIP\" treatment.   America has butchered Paris!",

My boyfriend got a burger and I stole a bite (of course :) ) and it was A-OK :)  What stole the show was the service.  My water was refilled as if by magic and our server was very pretty and helpful with suggestions.  Not bad, overall!",

    "text": "I'm not sure how my friends and I ended up here. No, we weren't drunk at all because we happened to walk around Paris right after our ~3hour drive. I didn't think I was hungry since it was 10 pm but somehow our group ended up in this quite spacey, dark, nicely decorated sports bar. I glanced around the restaurant and I mainly saw older... uuhh white haired men. The waitresses wore uniforms that consisted of bustiers and fishnet stockings and all I remember is: wowww fake boobies and how is she so toned and ripped?? (while eating my greasy fatty food =) )  Our waiter was nice and patient because we were being indecisive. He recommended 'Le Paris' Burger, so with two other friends we ordered that and 'Le Combinaison.' The food seemed to take a bit while, not tooo long, but still testing our impatience just a little. But all the orders came out together and us girls DEVOURED everything.  Le combinaison (12.99) is like a typical all-american sportsbar sampler with hot wings, chicken tenders, potato skins, onion rings, popcorn shrimp, celery and carrot sticks, with ranch and bleu cheese sauce. omgggg. i haven't eaten so much greasy and fried and calorie-glorified food in so long, especially around the time I went to this restaurant because I was trying to look fit for vegas (we went right before summer was ending).  And Le paris (11.99) burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, smoked bacon, and I think with pickles on the side? I don't know what made this burger so delicious, but it was juicy and flavorful! That burger disappeared so quickly. :( hahaa. I would definitely like to eat the Le paris again.  Oh and wash the oily food down with blue moon with orange slice garnish. yummm start off Vegas by being a fatty ahhhh!   In my opinion, the portions weren't too big so the orders were a little bit on the pricey side. And I'm sure I would've rather used the money for something mindblastingly delicious (albeit expensive) elsewhere in Vegas. But the food left us satisfied and content. I think it might've been just my stomach from not being used to eating such greasy food in so long, but we were walking down the strip and I had such a tummy ache. That's why I give Le Burger Brasserie 3 stars because I associate it with greasy, fried food that gave me tummy ache!",

    "text": "The menu changed pretty drastically and I'm fully convinced that it's been (gordon) ramsayed. Let me explain what I mean. I've watched enough kitchen nightmares and eaten at Ramsay's burgr to realize that by the time Ramsay is done with a restaurant, the menu becomes short and concise, portions are very exact - just enough to get full, and combos so to speak are non existent. Now I don't know for a fact that Ramsay had anything to do with the drastic changes (it's just my theory), but it sure felt that way.  I enjoyed my food, but honestly, I was really disappointed with the changes. There isn't much unique about this place anymore. Before, they had all sorts of different options for burgers - lamb, salmon, chicken, burgers (even a kobe beef option), and it had sort of a French twist to it. Now, everything was pretty standard for any other high end burger place. I was kind of fantasizing about the lamb burger, so seeing it removed from the menu was kind of tragic to me. It also somewhat annoyed me that about a third of the significantly reduced menu entrees were hot dogs or bratwursts. Not that I have anything against hot dogs, except the name of the restaurant is BURGER Brasserie.  They also used to have combo options, where you could add fries and/or milkshakes at somewhat of a discount as opposed to ordering separately, and those were gone too.  I got the shaft bleu burger and my boyfriend got the french onion burger. Mine was delicious, but there was a bit much bleu cheese for my taste. The french onion was good, but in my opinion, it's pricey for just being gruyere and onions.  We also got the gravy fries and the chocolate nutella milkshake. One thing that I thought was odd was that all the milkshakes on their menu had alcohol, which is fine because I didn't mind the alcohol. But if I didn't want the alcohol, I would have been a bit upset to pay for it and have them not include the alcohol. I liked the nutella shake from my last visit a lot better. Don't know why, but it wasn't as good this time. The gravy fries had really delicious flavor, but unfortunately were a touch too oily for my taste and also, like I said, I feel like it was Ramsayed because the portion was considerably smaller than what I expected (last time when we got bleu cheese fries, the portion was very generous - the bleu cheese fries were also no longer on the menu). I mean I'm not expecting them to be healthy by any means (they're called gravy fries for pete's sake), but I didn't like seeing all the oil seeping out.  Service: Our waitress (Nicolette) was wonderful. She walked us through the new menu, and came to check on us enough, but not too much and she was very friendly.  The hostesses on the other hand...were just meh...there were three of them that were just kind of huddled around the stand. There was a wait time to be seated, even though there were plenty of open tables. (This might not have been their fault though...I don't know if the restaurant was understaffed or something...I don't know this for sure, but regardless it was still weird to me.) When it was our turn to get seated, they just called out my name. But they didn't call it very loudly and I think it was just chance I heard it, because my boyfriend didn't hear it. There's a water fountain right outside the entrance to BB and there's a lot of people walking through so it's hard to hear. But it seemed like they weren't making a lot of effort.  Overall: I'm disappointed with the changes. The experience this time really was just ok, hence the 3 star rating. There's nothing special about this place that will really cause me to make a special trip anymore.",

    "text": "A little over a year ago Burger Boy and I went on a burger eating binge across Las Vegas, and were able to check off most of the locations we wanted. One of them that we didn't get to, and one that took me over a year to get back to, is Le Burger Brasserie at the Paris. It's a location that seems to fly well under the radar of burger enthusiasts in town as I never hear about it, and the few times I've brought it up in conversation no one seems to know what I'm talking about. And even though it's a strip location and not the hidden local gem I'm searching for, this place is still an unknown that I'm glad to have discovered.  The restaurant is located in a strange transitional connector area between the Paris and Bally's amidst a few retail stores and other touristy junk. The venue is billed as a 'Sports Grille', but due to the lack of sports events going on the night I was there I didn't really get that feel, but instead it just felt more like a typical touristy strip restaurant. Not that this is a negative, just wasn't all that fancy or unique of an interior.  The menu is French themed as one would expect, with your typical offerings of sliders, salads, entrees, and of course burgers, but all with a French theme and French names. For burger patty options you can chose from beef, vegetarian, salmon, chicken and turkey. And if you're feeling really spendy you can order the 777 Burger, with Kobe beef, Maine lobster, a 100-year aged balsamic served with a bottle of Rose Dom Perignon Champagne. I was not, so I went with a Le Paris burger, which came with Brie, caramelized onion and smoked bacon on a caramelized onion bun. The bartender talked me into getting the waffle fries which I typically don't like, but more on that shortly.  The burger came out in a nice presentation with the top bun next to the rest of the ensemble, and an olive stuck on top. The bun wasn't quite cut in half as the top portion seemed extra thin, but didn't present as much of a problem as I feared. Upon first bite I was impressed with the burger; the meat had great flavor, was cooked perfectly, and was proportioned very well to the bun. The brie and onions also had really good flavor, and the smoked bacon was cooked just right. The bun was sweet and delicious, and almost had a croissant flavor to it which I appreciated. The French theme carried through all the way, and it was great.  The waffle fries were also quite good, even considering the fact that I don't typically like them. This selection prevented me from checking out their regular fries, but based on the burger and waffle fries I had, I'm sure they're ok. Also, the pickle that came on the side was good, but I'm starting to think that's it's kind of hard to mess up a pickle.  The overall price of my meal was $21.08, which included a $12 burger, $4 waffle fries and a $3.50 iced tea. While I have a bit of a hard time paying over $7 for the fry and drink portion of my meal, the total price for a strip location, as well as the quality of my burger was more than acceptable.  So although you may have never heard of the place, and the Paris probably isn't too much of an attraction these days for locals, Le Burger Brasserie serves up a great burger and is worth checking out. Plus, it's located very close to the garage entrance so it's easy to get in and out of the property without straying too far.",

The regular burger is okay, it's real beef from scratch, but for the price you pay nothing special.  But the FRIES, both waffle and \"shoestring\" fries which are really not thin enough to call shoestring, are both frozen Albertson's french fries, I've tasted them before, there's no mistaking.  Really poor quality french fries for the price you pay to eat here.  You get better french fries at a Denny's.  If you've heard of BLT burger in Mirage, or LBS at Red Rock, and thought this would be a similar upscale burger joint, you are as mistaken as I was.  This is simply a crappy sports bar with a french name, not gourmet in the least.  You would be better off at Applebee's, the food quality is better there.",

    "text": "On the road again, this time in beautiful Las Vegas. Stopped  in for a quick burger for dinner here figuring how hard is it to mess up a burger when it's actually part of your name, right?  Wrong!  To top it off, they were running a restaurant week special, usually designed to showcase what you can do to promote your restaurant. This was an all around fail. The special offered pita chips and spinach dip, a couple of burger prions which I choose the pastrami burger,and cheesecake for dessert. The dip was good,  unfortunately the pita chips were burnt. Not sure what they were trying to do there.  Then comes the burger. Only the burger in the middle of an otherwise empty plate. Not even garnish.(maybe they were trying to showcase...?)  Basically a pretzel bun, burger cooked a perfect medium-rare, (realty the only good part)  1000 island dressing (aka \"special sauce\") grilled onions and a pile of thick cut pastrami. First on a burger, the thick cut meat was way too much.  Hard to bite thru everything, and since the bun wasn't toasted,  the special sauce soaked thru the bottom turning the whole thing into an over salty (heavy pastrami) mess. Sat at the bar,  was never asked how everything was, not even when they picked up the plates with only half the burger eaten and most of the app left.   After 10 minutes of sitting there with no other service I finally just got the check and left skipping the last part of the dinner which was a piece of cheesecake.  I was never even offered the dessert ...  If this is how they show what they can do for restaurant week,  I'm glad I didn't get any deeper into the menu.  Next time in Vegas if your at Ballys or Paris, this us a definite skip!  To many other options for good food!",

    "text": "Bf and I went here for a late night snack. We decided to share a burger , a basket of skinny fries and waffles fries. For dessert , I got the beignets. Overall, the food was amazing. I was disappointed in waffles Pom frites , but I guess I expected crispy Pom frites similar to Mon Ami Gabi, and I ended up w waffles fries similar to Carl's jr. At least, my bf likes it. My favorite was the beignets. Yumm...  However,if there was star that I could give for the service, I would give them 2 stars. When my bf pay w his credit card, the waitress asked for his ID. That was the first. I thought maybe it was their policy to check ID but as I pay attention no one else was asked for their ID w credit card payment. We didn't even have alcohol. It just makes me wonder if it's because we looked like two teenagers who can't afford to eat there?",

The fries were crisp on the outside and soft in the inside.  The peanut butter shake was delicious.  Wish I had asked if they could spike it with Malibu Rum.  Oh well.  Yes, I agree, $20 for a burger, fries and a shake seems excessive.  But, its in the Paris Shoppes, and everything was fantastic quality.  Having spent $12 on a lamb burger at Unami in L.A. a couple of weeks ago, and it was 1/2 the size of this lamb burger, I have no complaints about the price.",

The meat itself was tasty and was cooked as I requested (which is more than I can say for Mesa Grill).  I would definitely go back if I was craving a burger and would recommend it to friends. The fries were crispy and fresh and my beer was nice and cold. For a little place tucked away inside Paris, this is a very good burger joint. Reasonable prices too.",

The burgers we ordered were great. Cooked just the way we ordered them. The bread for the buns were toasted perfectly. Our issues were the fries. We ordered the sampler with their three fries. All three looked and tasted like any frozen fries you could buy at the store. Remarkably unremarkable.  A good buyer is only half the meal. You have to have good fries.

    "text": "Paris Las Vegas does a good job of hyping a typical sports bar.  Here, they tell us, even the condiments are sensual.  At the end of the day, however, it's a sports bar in a fancy casino, so expect some gussying up of typical American food.  The menu was impressive.  Sure, they had the traditional cow burgers, but they added turkey burgers also. And salmon! And lamb! And, relegated to the bottom right corner of the menu, were some vegetable burgers that may be perfectly tasty, but who would come to a burger joint for that?  I chose the lamb burger, and ordered a side dish of fat fries and waffle fries.  I'd figured they'd give me two smallish servings of each type, but no, they trotted out a full order of potatoes.  Although initially I got the petit fries with the waffle fries, the waitress realized her mistake and brought out a full order of steak fries as well.  Turns out I liked the petit fries better; they were crispy and seasoned, the steak fries were kinda bland.  As was the lamb burger, surprisingly.  I'd chosen the lamb because I thought it would have a darker flavour to it, but apparently this is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, I've got no doubt that this was one of the better lamb burgers out there.  But I've come to realize, after eating here, that I shall be keeping my lamb on its rack, and having the traditional cow in my burgers.  The condiments, by the way, are plain old condiments.  Ketchup and mustard come in the standard squeezable bottle, and the pickle was just a pickle.",

When our food came out, someone in our party asked for jalapenos. Our bartender had walked away so she asked a server that was behind the bar. He had a thick mustache and a horrible attitude. He said, \"did you ask your server?\" No we hadn't but what does that matter? You work here, figure it out yourself. He rolled his eyes and brought the jalapenos. When the bill came, we saw we were being charged for the apps we never received. We mentioned this to the bartender and he said he was going to have his manager take them off the bill. We waited for about 10-15 minutes for this and they weren't even busy. Finally the bartender gave us the \"new bill\" and I saw the apps were still there. So I said enough is enough. I did the math myself and left exact change and underlined the apps so they'd know why there wasn't tip. I felt like no one wanted to help one another out. I realize servers have their sections but it really felt like we were bothering by asking for another round or for jalapenos. And no one smiled!!!!! Ever. Also, check your bill over well. They'll take advantage. Never returning here. Food wasn't great anyway.",

Go to the hostess, she says 10-15 minute wait. Um, okay seems average. I look inside the restaurant and there were literally a handful of people in there.   Finally get seated. It takes this guy FOREVER to come by, greet us and get out drink orders. Cool, you may be busy(?). Well let's just say kids...the fun doesn't end there. We ask him questions about items on the menu, he rudely cut us off with every other sentence to \"answer our question\".   Ugh, so that takes for ever. Just the appetizers! I would  like to have also been told that the BURGERS didn't come with FRIES...yeah I will just leave it at that. The waiter was slow and not to mention the couple next to us was mentioning to the waiter his wife had to use the restroom because she was not feeling well because of her lunch.

I had never been here, but was planning an upcoming trip to Vegas, when I saw a Groupon advertised. I briefly checked out their menu and decided to purchase the Groupon.   When we arrived, we were seated immediately, as there was hardly anybody there. This place seems to be more suitable for adults. The wait staff was good, very friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything and that our drinks stayed filled.  I ordered the French onion Burger and man was it goooooood!!! The cornmeal bun was just right, not too big, not too small. I ordered my burger well done, and it was cooked just right. The cheese was ooey-gooey and the french onions were very tender and had a perfect balance of flavor. The burger was expensive, I believe $14 or $15 and it did NOT come w/ any sides, just the burger.  My husband ordered the housemade cheddar dog w/ cheese curds. It was about a foot long and had cheese melted on top and down the sides. You could tell that the cheesecurds were also housemade and not out of a freezer, they were tempura style. There was also some sort of redpepper relish on top that was tasty.  This place is super expensive for a burger joint. I purchase my burger, my husbands burger, a plain cheeseburger, pretzel appetizer and 3 soft drinks and the bill was over $70!!! We did not have any fries or side dishes w/ our meals, everything is a la carte. Even w/ my Groupon I still ended up paying over $40. They have a burger called the '777' and it costs just that, $777!!! I dont think I could even convince myself to order that even if I had that kind of $$$.  The food is really good, but for that price I would have rather gone and had a nice steak dinner w/ all the fixings, appetizers and dessert. If you dont mind shelling out over $14 for a burger, I would recommend eating here cause everything we ate was delicious and the service we received was good.",

The menu consists primarily of burgers, a few salads, appetizers, shakes, drinks and a couple of sides.  Prices for burgers run in the $14-18 dollar range along with a gimmick \"777\" burger which costs $777.  I tried to ask our server about it, but she wasn't listening to me, a theme which continued throughout the night. My wife had the bleu burger which came with bacon, and a delicious house made sesame bun.  I have never seen so much bleu cheese on a burger and although I enjoy bleu cheese on burgers and steaks there was way to much cheese.  My wife had to scrape off the excess cheese.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly with a little pink in the center.  I ordered the No Bones Rib Sandwich.  It was served on the same house made sesame roll and when I picked it up it weighed a ton.  Seriously that sandwich weighed at least a pound. There was a large amount of boneless rib meat, onion strings and some type of pickled cabbage or slaw.  The sandwich looked and sounded better than it tasted though.  Unfortunately if was just okay for me.  We ordered a side of fries to share and were hoping for the thin crispy delicious fries served in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, but unfortunately we got plain old fries which broke in half every time we tried to dip them in the tasty spicy ketchup that it came with.  The highlight of our meal were the alcoholic shakes. We ordered the cookies and cream and mint chocolate shakes which were pretty tasty for $8 each.  Although Holsteins and Burgr serves better shakes these were pretty good and cheaper than the other two places.  Our server was friendly and attentive but irritatingly only spoke and listened to my wife.  Now I have worked in food service before and I know that female servers will often focus on the female when serving couples as to not risk the female thinking the server was flirting with her man, but this was just outright being ignored. Perhaps the skimpy outfits the servers wear played a part in this, but for me this was just BAD service.  Our food also took at least 20 minutes to come out even though the place was not busy.  Overall even with the $20 for $40 Groupon we still spent $40 after tip.  We had a burger, a sandwich, one order of fries and two shakes. Without the Groupon our bill would have been $60 assuming a 20% tip.  With all the great burger places in Vegas I can't recommend coming here and paying these prices for average food.",

It ended up consisting of a bunch of mushrooms tomatoes onions and pickles. That's it.... No fries. Nothing!  They charged her $17!!!   Her friends burger cost $15 with meat and fries. I think it's disgusting that they thought they could do that. Massive thumbs down Burger Brasserie. You suck!",

Let's start with the positives... -No wait -Served quick -Service was great -Le Saumon Salmon (their salmon burger).  I had this on my most recent visit and was actually surprised.  I've had their burgers before and rather stick to a good old fashion American burger.  However, their salmon was pretty tasty, on the healthier side, and packed with protein.  Not complaining here.   Just Okay... -The rest of their burgers. I've had their Le Kobe Burger and Sliders on past visits.  Let's just say that I wasn't too impressed, especially since their known for burgers -Menu Selection -Price  Overall,  I really don't have too many negatives.  I rather go elsewhere for a burger.  Ironically, their salmon is pretty good.",

First time I came here, the waitress was really sweet, but forgot to put in my boyfriend's order for a shake, and neither of us were that terribly excited about the food we did receive, especially for the price. Also, I realize it may be hotel policy, but they wouldn't honor our Harrah's comp voucher unless we charged the meal to the room.  Second time, I go to place a to-go order for a burger and fries. Hostess says I need to order at the bar. Well, that's no problem for me. I don't care where I order.   But I proceed immediately to the bar, where for the next 7 minutes I witness the bartender flair pouring a vodka soda and opening two beers. Nobody clapped... nobody was even watching him. Nobody gave a crap about him rolling the cocktail shaker and Skyy bottle around on his palm and forearms for 3 minutes. Even the chick who ordered the round wasn't watching. (FYI: I have 8 years in the restaurant industry... 7 of which were as a bartender, so don't give me crap about not knowing what was going on. I would have filled that entire order in 40 seconds.) No matter where I go, I ALWAYS watch the bartender work, and this guy was a waste of waiting, paying customers' time! He and the barback never acknowledged me or anyone else, really, and I waited around a further few minutes after the \"show\" was over. I walked out and ended up finished leftovers instead.",

The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges.

The reason I'm giving them only 3 stars is because of the service. Our waitress Olivia was just so rude with an attitude. It seemed like she didn't like her job and didn't want to help at all. By the time she brought our ranch and hot sauce our food was cold already. So overall good food but bad service.",

    "text": "I actually forgot I ate at Le Burger Brasserie. It was okay, not memorable. Wife and I had been heading out of Vegas that time around noon, and decided we better get sometime to eat. We hadn't had breakfast and to be honest, weren't really all that hungry. I guess that's what a week in Vegas will do to anybody. We actually split the le kobe with crispy bacon on a seasame bun with the waffle fries and the chocolate shake. It was pretty good, maybe we should have had a sauce or spread on it. Didn't realize we had to add sauces for an additional charge. The patty wasn't bad, although I'm sure that guy wasn't made in house. The waffle fries were crispy and hot, however way over salted with the seasoning. The chocolate shake was good too. Nothing out of this world. Actually, we would probably try it again.   The hostess was actually one of the more friendly out of all the restaurants we dined at this round in Vegas, however our server was hasty and a little insincere. When she picked up our bill, I had wanted to use some hotel credits towards the meal, and remaining balance on my debit card. As I'm trying to explain to her she is still walking off with the check. Oh well, she figured it out. But please... To all servers... Listen to your patrons. I know you hear it all, but at least to us, and most people, the service makes our meal, not always the actual food. I feel in this case, the food would have been better if the server was actually there for us.",

    "text": "Terrible service by management. My husband and I got sat at a 1/2 table/booth. We requested a booth. Our waitress finally came to our table, after 10min. and when we asked to be moved to a full booth, she said that \"no one works there.\" I proceeded to look around and saw people, and said \" I see a few people working here.\" She then said we would have to wait 20min, until another server was clocked in to serve us. I then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said to us, \" the manager is too busy to come over.\" .... \"Too busy,\" really? The waitress then came back and sweetly asked for our drink order and reintroduced herself, I'm sure in attempts, to salvage her prior rude behavior. Then after 15 min the manager came. We then asked if we could sit in the section I wanted and the manager repeated again to us \" you have to wait until another server clocks in.\" I then asked why 3 parties got sat, in the section we wanted. He said \" you didn't ask for that section.\" (I had been asking the whole time) He then, smugly, let us move. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 5 plus years and have never treated any guest with such demeanor. Not only were we told repeated excuses, for something as easy as moving a table, the manager tried to correct me in my request saying \"you didn't ask for that section.\"   People go to Vegas for many different reasons. I'm pretty sure getting a simple burger should not be so complicated.",

This order is good for two people already.  We had nachos too. Huge!!! This would be good for 1.5 people...  Chicken Tenders were really good and the fries that came with it were ok. Large enough for 1.5 persons.  Yup, we ordered enough food for 5 people but there were only 3 of us. Yikes.  The line to get in wasn't too bad. There were a lot of vacant tables.  There were big screens everywhere playing football. My husband was having a great time.  There was an employee (bus-lady? drinks runner?)  that was very dismissive to a family that just walked in and were just seated at a table next to us. Causing them to walk out. Too bad the waitress got the brunt of the blame",

When they arrived, the wings were sitting in oil & the duo had a thick layer of oil on the top. Mixing the dip did nothing for it & we each barely had 1 wing before we decided that eating any more would make us sick. I ended up taking the bread and pretzels from the buffalo chicken dip & using the Dijon mustard on the table to dip it in. Certainly would not recommend those 2 dips",

The service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy, so it wasn't a big deal to me.  I went with the L'americain burger. It comes with American cheese, onion rings, and mushrooms. The burger was really good and it's a pretty big burger, too so very filling.  She asked what kind of fried I wanted, so I assumed those were included in the price, but when I got the check, it turned out they were an extra $5, so just be aware of that. They were very good fries though.  It was a little pricey for what it is, but I guess that's the norm on the strip.  Overall, I was happy with my choice, although I would rather have gone next door to Planet Hollywood to try Gordon Ramsay's burger place, but I didn't have time.",

When I opened my silverware the knife was extremely dirty. Something like that should not happen at such an expensive establishment. Next issue was all the condiments on the table were empty. The restaurant was not crowded so there is no reason why a burger place should be running out of such basics. The worst part was a burger was ordered to be cooked to medium well. When it came out it was rare. When pointed out the waitress argued that we were wrong and it was medium, which is still not what was ordered. Another burger was requested and it came out the exact same, but this time we were told that it was medium well, it was the exact same though. Then we were told we could have it cooked to well done instead if we weren't happy. A burger place should know how to cook burgers and they clearly did not. At the end they didn't have us pay for a burger we didn't eat. But after all that trouble and 1/2 of the people not having a meal to eat we still had to pay for the remaining meal.",

We sat right down and were given the trivia question of the day.  Apparently if you get the question right (which we did) you get 10% off your final bill.  I don't know if they offer you the 10% off if you get it wrong as a nice gesture, but it was a nice little start to the meal.  Our question was about Super Bowl I, and we knew it without using our phones.  No idea if they allow internet-related help in answering the question.  Our server had too many tables, basically half the restaurant, but she did well.  She hustled for refills and beers for us, and we received our food in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  Additionally, she got us the bill and processed the payment quickly.  So, no issues with the service.  To eat, I went with the sliders, which are smaller versions of the cheeseburger (cheese, tomato, pickles), the blue burger (blue cheese, bacon, and garlic aioli) and the Paris burger (blue cheese, grilled onions, and bacon).  Our table also split an order of fries and an order of onion rings, which was enough for 3 people.  The food arrived after about 12 or so minutes.  It was hot and clearly had just been made.  The burgers are small, even for sliders.  And, the meat was thinner than I was expecting.  But, it was cooked properly to medium rare.  The cheeseburger was pretty basic.  My favorite was the blue, but it and the Paris burger were pretty close.  Both had strong tastes of blue cheese and bacon, which is typically a good thing.  I didn't get much of the garlic aioli on the blue burger.  But, I liked them, probably just due to the blue cheese and bacon.  The sides were also fresh, in fact the onion rings were too hot when we first got them.  They are dusted in Cheeto dust and served with what I would describe as a hot Cheeto ranch sauce.  The Cheeto dust was unnecessary but the sauce was really good.  Surprisingly good.  We all liked it and dipped both the onion rings and fries in it.  The server noticed we were running low and offered to bring us more.  Very interesting sauce, and one we all liked.  The fries were standard thin french fries, served with spiced ketchup.  It's not spicy, but it definitely doesn't taste like standard ketchup.  Again, I liked it.  Bruger Basserie does sauces very well in my limited experience.  I can see watching a game here, it is definitely a sports bar type joint.  As far as the burgers go, there are plenty of places on the Strip to get better burgers.  But, I've also had worse on the Strip.",

At this time, we had checked out of hotel, so we had luggage in tow.  We decided we would eat one last good meal.   So here we are, this location is right next door to Ballys.  This restaurant had nice ramps, luggage & ADA convenience.  This place had a lot of TV's so the spouse was sold already.    I had the make your own burger, Kobe meat with with Tillamook cheese.  If you love cheddar, you would love Tillamook.  This place offers many options & varieties when it comes to burgers.  I can't see no mistakes here.  The burger was made medium rare- oh my! The buns were available in different ways, onion, wheat etc.  The restaurant lightly toasts the bun & provides many, various toppings. I was NOT disappointed.   Oh yes, the fries portion was substantial enough for 2 people & seasoned just right!  The hubby lol reformed beef water, had a Philly Cheese steak, with onion Soup. I  think he stopped eating only to breathe.   Hubby was very pleased with his big A$$ sandwich.      If you are staying @ Ballys, make sure to get s coupon 20% off during lunch hours.  Also, make sure to present players card for points.   We would definitely eat here again!",

My folks and I were trying to find a comfortable restaurant that was reasonably priced and had good comfort food, without much delay for table.   The service was friendly and spectacular, the vibe was busy but quiet enough to have conversation, and the food was great. I went for the $19.99 Burger with the choice of beer and fries or onion rings. The onion rings were spectacular, but as this is a burger themed restaurant, I would have to say they knocked it out of the park. One of my all-time favorite burgers, perfectly cooked and so flavorful. My folks really enjoyed their meal as well, everyone happy.  Highly recommend this establishment, which is just off the Bally's Casino floor maybe 50 feet into the hallway on the way to Paris. Go grab a burger today, you will love it.",

Our server, Billy, was super nice and attentive. We ordered drinks, burgers, and two types of fries (regular & sweet potato). The first drink came out really quickly but it took a lot longer for the other two. The drinks were pretty good. My only complaint here is that my Caipirinha had a little bit too much sugar. The burgers and fries came out almost simultaneously, as they should. Both of the fries were good, I think the sweet potato ones (w/ mayo-based sauce) were my favorite. I got the Champagne Turkey Burger and it was pretty good but I wish I had asked for no bacon. Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but I don't think it belongs on a turkey burger. (Especially because most people order a turkey burger as a healthier alternative.) What matters most, though, is that we all left full and satisfied with our lunch. Shout out to Billy for taking us from hangry to happy!",

    "text": "Honestly, I'm surprised this place isn't rated higher! I really enjoyed this place. It has a great feel to it. I wouldn't have picked this place if it wasn't for the coupon I got. Paris has such nice bakeries and cafes, and this place gets kind of lost in that scene.   Anyway, they weren't that many people there. Our waitress gave us waters pretty quickly and introduced herself. She did a pretty good job overall.  As for the food, my friends and I all got burgers. I got the L'American burger with avocado, my friend got the L'Italian burger and my other friend got the Kobe burger. We all got it medium cooked. It was perfect for two of us, but my friend who ordered the Kobe beef said it was a bit rarer than he liked it to be. We all enjoyed our burgers. They don't look filling, but oh my, they are. NOTE: Fries don't come with the burger, they cost an extra $2 (it sucks I know).  Two of us ordered dessert. I ended up getting the Chocolate Tiramisu and my friend ordered the Dessert Sliders. The tiramisu was fantastic. It came in a cup, which was kind of weird. You had to dig deep in order to get all the flavors and layers. It was a HUGE portion, so watch out! The sliders were very interesting. It was something I've never seen before. They looked like mini burgers, but they were really raspberry, mango and cheesecake gelatin shaped into tomatoes, cheese and a patty. It was surprisingly pretty good.  Overall, had a great experience here and would come back again.",

They have a Burger, Fries and Drink combo - Sweet!  Note: If you show your players card, you get  $1 off , WOW a whole dollar. I love how the entire menu has a special blue column for \"Players card\" pricing and everything is just $1 less then the original price. They should just put a note at the bottom of the menu instead of repeating every price.   Burger: I opted for the Lamb Burger. Cooked perfectly, it was delicious. I ony made it through half, it was so big. I wish it tasted like lamb instead of beef. The lamb flavor was so distinct, it was easy to miss.  Sweet Potato Fries: PERFECT!  Milkshake: Banana, Mmm! Best ever! It looks small but this sucker's huge!  I would definitely return but this place would not be the first place I visit.

For our first course we had stuffed potato skins and wow that was full of flavor!   Second course we all ordered the beef burger BUT its not just any burger. It's a beef burger with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun. Needless to say, wholly shit it was big! We all ended up removing one grilled cheese bun and using the other one as our bun. I liked the wafffles fries a lot more than the regular fries.   Third course was cheesecake with blueberry and lemon. That was the first time I've had cheesecake that was not so sweet. My sisters and I packed ours for home as we were stuffed and gave it to our parents (and my dad REALLY loved the cheesecake since he is not a sweets person). I shared a plate with the bf and my sisters took my brother's cheesecake.   I don't remember much about the service, the waitresses was nice is all I remembered, lol. Must be food coma!  I would definitely come here again esp for those stuffed potato skins!",

    "text": "I like the unique flavors here. For a gourmet burger place, there's lots of quirky sides that shine. Cheetoh-dusted onion rings, poutine, and Mac and cheeseburger bites that are to die for. Yes, you read that right. They one upped mac and cheese bites and added delicious ground beef. I'm a fan of their waffle fries, but you can order regular fries or sweet potato. I decided to go with a traditional Kobe beef burger with crispy onions, while my girlfriend tried the lamb with avocado and bacon. Both were excellent and cooked to perfection. The cherry on top of all of this amazing food was the Oreo shake we ordered. I am not big on shakes, but this is hands down the best milkshake I will probably ever have. It was spiked, though you couldn't tell. It was smooth, creamy, and I couldn't get enough. The presentation of the food is also really fun. Cones for fries, and the burgers come with toothpicks in the center with BB initials. Little touches like this are sure to be appreciated by those who pay attention to detail.  The service is a tiny bit slow, and the burgers do take a bit to cook. The waitresses dress in very showy outfits, so it's not the best restaurant for kids. There are bright red corsets, fishnets, and clevage involved. From the outside you can already tell it's a sports bar. It's not really French themed at all, except for a french word thrown in the title. This restaurant definitely caters to men. There are games on the flat screens and a hearty drink menu. It's best to go during Happy Hour to take full advantage of their selection. The price is moderate for a Vegas restaurant, especially one located inside a casino. We paid $40 in all for the appetizer, drinks, and two entrees with fries. I wish the fries came with your burger, since you're paying $9-15 for just a singular burger. Not cheap, but certainly could have cost more since it's Vegas. Well done, Burger Brasserie! (Get it?)",

The staff is friendly enough, but the service is slow.  We started with the potato skins, which were OK. It's bar food, so it isn't fantastic, but the skins were thick and well cooked. The accompanying BBQ sauce and ranch tasted like something you'd buy from a grocery store; it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't make it in house. The guacamole that came with it was pretty good.  We split a Kobe burger with caramelized onions and waffle fries. The patty was excellent, the toppings were fresh, and I thought the bun was really good. It's one of the best burgers I've had. The waffle fries were thick, but they tasted like they were frozen beforehand.  I want to give this place a higher rating, but I'd have to try more and the service would have to be better.

    "text": "I decided to give Le Burger Brasserie a try since I've already been to other popular burger spots of the Strip, Burger Bar and BLT Burger.  And no, I didn't try the $777 Burger with or without the bottle of Dom.  What I like about staying at the Harrah's properties is how they give you discount coupons to restaurants from each property.  They gave me a $5 off coupon for Le Burger Brasserie, so that instantly swayed me to go here for a burger.  I liked how they were open at 10:30am on Sunday for NFL Football (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=LFdFH85CuVO5dzMaLtyXqg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).  All the waiters and waitress were sporting NFL team jerseys.  The atmosphere was fun and how great is it to be watching NFL Football with crazy fans while enjoying a good burger.  It's a great combination!  I ordered the Le Kobe Burger with a Fried Egg for my topping (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=HsoANJwhGAc8lvRlmqGUMA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) because who doesn't like Fried Eggs on their Burgers?  Along with some Skinny Fries.  Had my burger cooked medium rare, though it was more medium well.  But it was ok since it was the morning that I arrived in Vegas and I was super hungry that I wanted to just devour something.  The Kobe Burger was ok, but since they overcooked it to medium well,  it wasn't as good as the one I had over at Burger Bar.  Still good nonetheless and the Fries were very crispy and seasoned well.  Fun dining experience and maybe down the road I'll try their $777 Burger, without the bottle of Dom of course.  4 Stars!",

    "text": "Even if the food would've been MIND-BLOWING, it'd still only get as high as 3 stars. Why one star?   The service: The service was completely subpar for such a seemingly swanky place. They got it wrong from the start. Our order came out in what can only be described as clearly over the average wait for a meal-close to 20 min. BUT WAIT, there's more... that simply alone wouldn't warrant a single, lonesome star.   During our meal, our server didn't come by til the end only to refill our drinks; didn't engage us, didn't ask if we needed anything-granted we didn't actually need anything, but it still woulda been nice to know she's on top of things.   Finally after our meal-which I'll write about in a sec-it was time for dessert. I would've asked our server for a dessert menu but she was MIA and after sitting there for 10 minutes with empty plates someone else comes to collect them. So I ask HIM for a dessert menu and he has this \"deer in headlights\" look. Lol. He just says, \"Ok\" and walks away never to be seen or heard from again. But our waitress did come by eventually, NOT with a dessert menu but with the damn bill. WTF happened to the menu? Lol. Sadly, it took another 20 minutes from the time she brought the bill to us getting up after paying.   Now the food:  I myself ordered the Campagne turkey burger. It was pretty good, but turkey was a bit dry. It was definitely lacking something though. BTW, don't expect fries or ANY side to come with that burger though. You'll have to cough up $7 for fries-which would be fine if they were fantastic fries!!! But they were just \"eh\". And as for condiments or dipping sauces? They don't have much and what the do have is \"fancied up\" superfluously.   All-in-all, as a local, I can't actually recommend this place and I don't see myself coming back.",

You might wait even longer after you're done for someone to let you pay for your meal. You might wait a bit for a drink.  The burger is decent; better than many. They claim to be able to make burgers medium-rare, but mine arrived medium both times. Still, even medium, it was a good burger. It's a few dollars overpriced.  The fries are soft and unremarkable. You can replace them with some onion rings, which are good, but they are eight dollars and you get five of them.  Overall, you'll feel like you paid too much for what you got.  Bottom line: if you're in Paris or Bally's, you'll find a decent burger here. But it's not worth traveling for.",

They also had a happy hour sign out front creating the illusion of a good drink at a reasonable price. Table service was decent, bar service not so much. Drinks were really weak, even when ordering a double and rather slow for a place that was more than half empty.I guess the beer specials were decent and maybe that's what they count on when trying to draw in a specific clientele into this sports bar. If you like the standard 'Coors Light' then I think this is your place. None of us did so I can't speak of the value on the buckets of beer. We had a few drinks, some waffle fries which were the highlight of our visit and hit the road.",

    "text": "Overall rating is 4.5 stars out of 5.  This place by far is one of the better restaurants my wife and I visited while in Vegas.   We decided to go to this place for lunch on 05/17/13. Since it was later in the evening and we planned on eating dinner in a few hours we thought we would make it a light lunch so we both decided we would order salads.  Our waitress (Who's name was Zenzen yeah I know) was by far the best server we had. She was cheerful, helpful, and very attentive.  She took our orders which was a chopped salad and a grilled chicken ceasar salad. My wife ordered the chopped salad and I had the grilled chicken ceasar salad.  The meals arrived in a reasonable amount of time and not only did they look good and plentiful but both salads tasted delicious as well. I mean my grilled chicken was grilled to perfection and the salad was dressed with just the right amount of ceasar dressing and cheese. And it also had soft croutons (If any of you are like me when it comes to salads then you know it is hard to restaurants that serve salads with the softer croutons because I can't stand croutons that are hard enough to break or chip your teeth). My wife said her chopped salad was also perfectly dressed and seasoned. It was actually so much that she couldn't even finish it.  Overall this place is a must visit if you are ever in the Bally's hotel. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because I didn't order there specialty which are burgers which I can not vouch for. However, the chopped and grilled chicken ceasar salads are top notch.",

He was a little short tonight, but overall he seems to know what he is doing.  I brushed it off as an off day for him.  I ordered the chicken tenders and plain fries.  The food came out very hot!!!  Great quality as far as taste and freshness.  If this restaurant was closer to home, I would consider going again.  However, I was bothered by the ambiance.  I understand it is located on the strip, but why is your hostess dressed in fishnet leggings and a corset that looks like it belongs in a strip club?  The other staff are sporting World Cup soccer T-shirt's.  The lights were low, and the scenery feels a bit more upscale...A bit.  So if you can imagine eating fancy sliders and chicken fingers while watching a half naked hostess(who really didn't even fit her clothes)walk around, you can understand why I felt uncomfortable seeing some elderly people trying to enjoy there dinners.  It felt awkward.  Add this to the scenery and it all confuses me.  Great food, typical Vegas style atmosphere.  Why not?",

It was about 5:40 when I sat down at a high top in the bar area and most of the bar seats were taken with the restaurant was about 1/3 full on a Wednesday.    The bartender came over and greeted me within 2 minutes and I received my drink within 2 minutes of ordering plus my food surprisingly arrived maybe 5-7 minutes after that.   The burger and fries were tasty and the bartender continued to check up on me appropriately throughout the time I was there. Plenty of TV screens which could feature a number of sporting events (tonight was a variety of baseball teams).   Music is playing and there is lively conversation but it's easy to talk and hear the person you are with. Tables and booths are available and afford privacy compared to some restaurants which stack the tables together as close as possible.  Burger $13, fries $6 and happy hour 2-4-1 drink another $6 for the two. While yes you can find occasional am discounts here or there or utilize coupons I consider this a very good deal for the strip. I definitely recommend.",

Will check out BurGR next time instead...  Also! They had a groupon when we went the second time, if you decide to check this place out look on groupon so you can get a discount.",

We got every question answered and had treated us like VIPS.  The food was actually really good, I had the BBQ Chicken Burger and it was very moist with a robust flavor. My father and I shared the Cheetos coated Onion Rings which came recommended by Amanda. They were ofcourse amazing and after the horrible experience we had at Laggasse Stadium the night before I will definitely be recommending this spot for the next sports outting !",

Checked on-line and found 2 charges, $29 and $102.05.  Had to return to the restaurant to straighten out the extra charge.  Eventually the charge was removed.  Not something you want to waste time on during vacation.  Food was good, but be sure to check your charge card account afterward. While waiting for the manager to fix this, I told others about the problem and to be sure to check their charge account afterward.  Hostess got upset and told me not to talk to others.  Hell, they needed to know too that this restaurant could be billing them an extra $100.   Alex our server also disappeared for extended periods of time.",

    "text": "Burger Brasserie curious.~  I got to try this Burger joint after the recommendation of a Paris employee from the players club as she recommended this place as a sports bar with good food after asking her about different options in the area. This restaurant ended up being the perfect spot for a casual lunch for burgers and more!   Upon entering this is located on the edge before the split between Paris and Bally's. The female servers are dressed up semi scandalous in the lingerie like outfits, but still semi-classy and professional staff. The area we had dined in was the corner which was nice and spacious.   The ambiance is nice and casual at the same time. Pricing here is about average and a good variety to satisfy cravings and cater to burger lovers along with plenty of drink options! =]   FOOD: Lemon Garlic Parmesan Wings, Hot Wings, Paris Burger, Almond Joy Dessert  DRINK:  Cab-arita and Caramel Macchiato Smoothie   The food was plentiful and served fresh! My Paris Burger was excellent with brie cheese, caramelized onion,smoked bacon.. MmMm brie  cheese! Both drinks I had were awesome from my alky and non-alky drink, and the ending with the dessert was a nice close to all the tasty food!   Overall, Burger Brasserie has fab service, a fun ambiance, and most importantly delicious food and drinks. =]",

I order steak and It didn't have any flavor. It just tasted like grill no seasoning what so ever. The burger was bland as well. The only thing we did like were the wings. The wings were great.

I guess you could taste the seasoning, but the onion rings were large and spongy.  They needed to be cooked more, but also probably taste better when eaten in the restaurant.

There is no way he will serve us.\" We looked around and it wasn't busy so I have no idea why he was so hostile. After waiting more than 10 minutes he comes over and says \"fine, let's get it over with\". Not only that but he took more than 10 more minutes to get us out beers from the tap that was literally between us and him.  As the meal continued he complained at a yelling level of volume about the game that was on. Also accused the patrons of not caring about his hometown team and generally made everyone uncomfortable.  That night my roommate and I both got food poisoning. That was the only meal we shared that day so one and one equals this restaurant is nasty. When my food arrived it did smell a bit off but I just chalked it up to my nose being a little off due to winter. Big mistake!",

It was extremely loud and I had to ask for another table. We waited forever for the waiter to come by and at least bring us water. The waiter finally came over to tell us he would be with us shortly. We waited another 5-7 minutes for him to come back. He could have at least brought us water while we waited. We hurried up and placed an order so he wouldn't disappear again. I'm very shocked that the burgers aren't served with a side. Really? A side of fires should be included with a $15-$20 burger. The fries are $8 extra. My husband had a regular cheeseburger and said it was good. We shared an order of pretzels and they were okay. Not a fan of the dipping sauces. There are plenty of other food options in Bally's/Paris to choose from. I won't be",

My favorite is the promenade chicken burgers: shallots, bacon and brie on ground chicken.  The onion rings and waffle fries are also great.  Both are perfectly crispy and well seasoned.  2 burgers and an order of fries to share will cost around $25 for a filling and tasty meal. The joint is great for watching sports or just catching a bite.",

I really wanna give my review 4 stars BUT the burgers don't come with any fries?!?! I knew this before hand since I looked the menu online but whats up with that? I know this is Vegas and money talks but come on now! Besides that though, the burger was good. I had the classic on parmesan, crack! Fries were good also, well for the 5 extra dollars I had to pay I atleast made them good. So food wise it was on point, the waitress was really nice also. I just can't get over those damn fries lol.  Oh yeah they got a lot of eye candy here! Everything from the waitress to the hostess.",

Second, I had ordered my burger without onions, and it came with onions.  Instead of replacing all the garnishes, they just removed the onions which had already permeated through to the garnishes, and so I could taste onions with every bite of the burger.  Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.  He asked them to take it back and melt it, and they said that they couldn't do that.  Fourth, our other friend had ordered his burger with wholewheat bun but was given a honey oat bun and, when asked, was told that it was wholewheat.  Fifth, my first friend had to ask for his milkshake three times before he got it!  Burger was nothing special, sweet potato fries were undercooked (Carls Jr has better sweet potato fries).  I'll never go there again and hope that others read this review and go elsewhere for a burger.",

When we arrived, it was pretty empty & we were seated in the bar area, which was fine because we got to take advantage of their 2-for-1 drinks during happy hour.  My burger was good (brie with caramelized onions), but I ordered it to be cooked medium & it was definitely well-done (not even the slightest hint of pink).  The burgers were all supposed to come with lettuce/tomatoes/pickles, but the chef forgot those items on all of our orders.  Service was a bit slow - we arrived at 5pm & didn't leave until 6:40 - barely enough time to make it to our 7pm show when I'd thought we would have had plenty of time to even do a little gambling beforehand.  My dad probably would give the restaurant 4 stars, because his burger was cooked properly.",

First and foremost I was offended by the lack of attention the waitress paid to us.  We waited for 15-20 minutes before she even approached the table.  We each ordered our own custom burgers (two beef, one veggie, and one lamb) and a fry sampler.  30 minutes later our food arrived as did the diet coke my friend had asked for 3 different times.  When I ordered my burger I asked that it be medium rare but when the burger arrived it was half medium rare and half well done.  Considering that I had eaten half the burger I just sucked it up and ate the rest.  I was afraid that if I said anything I would have to wait another 30-40 minutes before the food came out.  The waitress neglected to tell me that the kitchen was out of the roll I ordered until she brought me my burger (it would have been nice to choose a bun that went better with my topping choices). All in all the food was ok but the service was awful.  My suggestion is to find a better place to spend your money and your time.",

We were a large group, so I feel slightly bad for giving criticism, but the service was painfully slow. Some of my coworkers were on their second drink while others hadn't even gotten their first, many of the food orders took a long time (possibly misplaced?), and our server never asked if we wanted additional drinks.  Beyond the service, I found the food to be just blah. Once again, read someone else's review regarding their burgers, but as for their appetizer platter, french fries, shrimp Caesar salad, and tomato bisque soup, I was unimpressed. The appetizers were average (yet obviously cost double since it's Vegas) and my \"tomato bisque soup\" had to have been marinara sauce. My coworker even said it tasted like the same sauce she got with her fries. The only positive note for the food was that their shrimp was surprisingly delicious.  I don't often give negative reviews, but I just can't get on board with Burger Brasserie.",

The waitresses are dressed very provocative but I can't say the price is necessarily worth it because I got stuck with a male waiter....I was not pleased.

We had great service with one of the bartenders and not so great with another... but luckily we had the good one twice. That worked out well.   Regarding drinks - the bloody mary mix is good. Not horseradishy.. which is great! Added a splash of tabasco, and it was perfect.  Here's the real kicker - the mimosas. You get a mini-bottle of champagne and orange juice. None of the poured from a large bottle stuff. The whole little bottle. Well worth the $9.   The location is very convenient in the walk through from Bally's to Paris.

Ordered the spicy chicken wings and it was not only spicy but delicious. All the workers were so nice and were very helpful. Prices were a little high though. 3 burgers, 1 order of fries, and spicy hot wings for $87! Wow. Might come back if I hit a jackpot!!LOL!!",

I thought it was a nice and unique way to engage interested customers.  Anyway, we had a decent time here but probably would not go back.  I wasn't too fond of the restaurant interior. We were seated at a booth that felt rather grimy and outdated. It is also fairly dark inside and the table setup is sort of crowded. I am not sure exactly - but something about being there was just off and I never felt comfortable during our meal. Aside from that, our waiter was a very nice guy, but overall service was clumsy and scattered.  For dinner we started off with the gravy fries, which were delicious by the way. We followed up with a french dip style sandwich and custom kobe burger. I think we were satisfied with our entrees, but I feel like I could easily find something better elsewhere with a lower price tag.",

    "text": "I find the average rating of this upscale burger establishment both understandable and not understandable, all in the same breath. Minus my initial introduction from a hostess that just did not understand her role as the front person for the business, where the key is being understanding, diplomatic and patient. (Fail, Fail, Fail). My guess without reading all the reviews is a portion of the lower stars were from customers that faced a similar situation to mine, in dealing with her. (No names should be mentioned and won't) The truth is I hope she got canned for her horrible attitude and unprofessional approach to me and my party as it is the proper way to handle these types Once seated inside, peering at the well appointed dining area, grasping the classy menu (yes, even burger joints can have sophisticated menus from structure to content) I was totally at peace and ready to order. The service was excellent, never needing for an item that wasn't available nor offered. As we had a member of our group that was under the weather and spoke no English, I ordered for him a bowl of Chicken Noodle soup with extra French Bread and butter. The butter must have been hand churned as it was better than any I have had to date and the French bread was equally as outstanding, crispy, flaky, doughy served up piping hot. So few places do Mojotios and even less will prepare an wildcard fruit Mojito like strawberry, which our server Kristine assured us was no problem and it was delivered swiftly and the bar alchemist did a splendid job in its creation. If your not into such beverages, you can enjoy a cold Coors Light for the rock bottom price of $8.00. No not for a 12 ouncer but a 24! The Classic (Le Classique) medium rare, with a side of Bearnaise sauce, served on Parmesan bread was a real delight, quality ground beef cooked to perfection, but it paled in comparison to the Saveur Burger which just reached the pinnacle of burger predictability. The Petite cone of French Fries was far from petite as it was ample enough to provide a nice side order for a few patrons to share.  Unfortunately I can not recall the young mans name that was the MOD on the day we sat to eat at Le Burger Brasserie Sports Grille, but I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to him as a True food and beverage professional manager. When I first began this article, I mentioned a very unpleasant situation that was thrust upon me and my guests of not doing of our own, The young Asian gentleman (the MOD-Manager on Duty) listened to my explanation of the unpleasant reception we were greeted with. There was no wavering in his demeanor, he listened intently, sat us immediately and checked in with us after our meal had come to its completion. He saved our dining experience and this review to be sure.",

Refused to let out party have our requested server , and four times previously requesting prior to arrival . Upon sitting with my family a large gentleman was sitting in front of me so no big deal I move to the other end of the table. When another obnoxious gentleman was purposely standing in front of me after noticing my shift on the table . I asked management to ask them to have a seat so I can enjoy the game . Not only did the party in front of us was clearly annoyed by asking they purposely made issues . Again I went to management . They told me there is nothing they can do . I am with a family of 15+ !!! We are here having a good time -trying to watch the game . Then they asked if I wanted to move to the bar ALONE  !!!!!  Yes NOT ACCOMMODATING let's move this young lady away from her party of 15 instead of ensuring my comfort and Saftey . Not only did we pay a good amount of money , management could care less about their guests . I have worked in the industry and I am always professional and do everything to accommodate guests . That's just common curtesy . This place was an absolute let down and safe to say not retiring next year or any to follow",

We waited probably ten minutes, a bar tender was just running around, no method to the madness, kept walking right by us saying nothing. Finally we flagged him down, no hello, welcome, \"oh hey, what can I get you\" uhhh well menus, what's good here, drink specials, talk to me, or are we at a drive thru right now?   Ordered a whiskey and a beer then looked at the menu, no checking in, had to flag him down to tell him our order \"ok what do you want\" not scornful, just completely indifferent and uninterested.   Combo burger and fries and cordon bleu, \"what combo, we have many\" I mean the guy had the personality of a bucket drywall mud but says yeah cordon bleu is popular.   We order and wait, and wait. Two girls sit next to us and order, a couple next to them sits down and orders, we wait.... BOTH of them get their food, nothing for us. I'm like YO, what's going on here?? \"Uhhh with what? What do you want?\" Our FOOD! \"You didn't order yet\" ohhhh but we did, remember you said the cordon bleu was popular??? \"Oh yeah..., yeah uhhh it didn't go in, you didn't tell me, uhhh\" Ok you know what, close us out. \"Ok\" actually brings the bill and charges me, had to find a manager, he barely cared, \"ok I guess we can get your drinks, oh how much was it?\" who CARES, you guys SUCK! \"Ok yeah I guess we can do that\"   ohhhhhh and I was OUT after that, what a JOKE!",

For my meal I ordered the salmon sandwich. Soft bun with fresh salmon slices. My other half ordered the Paris burger! This burger is very big and delivers with tasy bacon and garlic mayo aioli. This restaurant specializes in its condiments and fries come with spicy ketchup. This restaurant was amazing and we will be making this a regular stop while in Vegas",

Since we are already paying customers. Instead of harassing us that you may kick us out even though we paid for beers, you ask if we would like to spend more money, it's called CUSTOMER SERVICE.

After that I saw that gravy fries were a normal item on menus in Vegas so I continued to order them but no other places compared to these ones.

Checked out Yelp and found this place.  Burgers were good but I screwed up by ordering them medium well. Was worried the patty was going to be too juicy causing the buns to be soggy but the patty was slightly too dry for my liking, I'm sure medium would have been perfect. All in all the taste was still good enough to warrant a 4 star.  If you're on the fence on which burger to try I would actually recommend the slider cos that's what my friend ordered and he got to try 3 different burgers.  There's quite a few burger places, will try others the next time and see if I'll miss this place enough.",

After making our way over to the restaurant at 9:49pm, on a Thursday night, we were told that the kitchen was closed--and she starts rambling about the hours for the weekend!!! I don't want the hours for Friday or Saturday! I want to eat now! The place seemed busy and I saw people walk in and get seated BEFORE us as we approach the hostess stand.  I was shocked because I had researched my food options nearby. They were scheduled to close at 12am--or so I thought.   My man was just as blown as I was when the hostess then said, \"kitchen closes at 945\". I told her that I had googled the place and it shows they're open til 12midnight. She just stared at me!   Our agenda that evening was to do the Eiffel Tower Experience then eat!  We are from out of town. My stomach is grumbling. I'm hungry. I'm pissed. I'm more hungry than pissed, so I just walk away. Off to give my coins to a place that is open.  Maybe we should have eaten first then gone up in the Eiffel Tower *shrug*",

The burger my other friend had said it was mediocre, the sweet potato fries were greasy and mushy. my husband and his friend had the short rib sandwich that was just meh.

We went for dinner and it was pretty busy but we were seated within 15 min, not long at all. They were short staffed that night but the servers and manager were up front about it and let us know, more so we didn't feel forgotten or ignored.  Nice move! Though they were short our service was still very timely and adequate. Brittney & Alex were great!  Some must trys: Macaroni & cheeseburger bites Oreo Shake (really delicious) Turkery burger with egg Chicken wings Gravy fries (amazing)  Definitely a cool, must try spot",

I figure if they knew how to do a better job, they would. Having worked in restaurants for 40 years, I know for a fact, they don't take customers' critiques seriously.    This place was so-so at best. Prices were about par for the course for a Vegas casual eatery.   I had the lamb burger. It was more than well-done, which meant it was drier than Red Rock Canyon in August. Neither ketchup nor mustard helped. The onion rings I ordered looked impressive, with huge slices stacked on a spindle. The let-down came when tasting them: extremely soggy(!!) batter and VERY mushy onions. I had 2 of them. Total waste of money.  Waitress was OK...nice enough, but not super attentive.   I definitely don't recommend  this place and would not choose to return.",

The burgers and fries have snooty ingredients to try to justify the price tag.  The upside is after you drop $65 on dinner for 2 you can earn some Total Rewards points.

Definitely a find for a reasonable place to dine and have a beer while on the strip!

The music was blaring and it was really hard to talk to my friend at the table. The second time I came it was for lunch. The restaurant was quiet and wonderful.   The burgers are good. They are fresh and they give ample portions.  My complaints would be as follows: The burgers are served on tissue paper and a mesh wire basket. For a $10 hamburger served without fries this is pretty ridiculous. Would a plate be too much.  Secondly fries anyone?? $10 and no side? That just can't fly.   For a place with such a great location you would think they wouldn't try and rake you across the knuckles.  Otherwise the selection is great and this is a great oasis to blow some winnings (hopefully).",

It's got the name of an upscale restaurant, with the serving staff that you'd probably expect to find at Planet Hollywood (casino), or maybe a strip club. This isn't to insult the fine ladies, they were very attractive and I do not mean that insultingly. It was just weird.  Weirder still was the interior straight out of a NYC dive bar, with bar staff that were doing crazy tricks a la TGI Fridays, but with the the conversation (IE: good) of a good, well-hidden bar in the aforementioned large apple.   More confusing still was the quality of the burgers, which were, frankly, shockingly good. I wanted more when I was done. Fresh avocado, nicely cooked medium burgers, and great blue cheese. In fact, the whole meal was delicious.  However, this was covered by the malaise of everybody pretending to be excited at the USA playing Brazil in an irrelevant soccer tournament, and the faint sound of bees buzzing that is the sound of a crowd. And, yes, this was really annoying when you're trying to enjoy a meal.   I just don't know what to make of this place, but I'd certainly go back and eat there. It was just a bit dissonant. I don't know, don't look at me. What am I, a bar scientist?",

The gals wear scantily clad outfits (hot pants and tight bustier tops) serving burgers and fries with plenty of add-ons. My fave was plain burger cooked medium with a fried egg, cheddar, and carmelized onions with thin-cut fries. Not too shabby with great beer. Oh, did i mention they have a 120oz beer? Overall they had 4 stars for burger, but the service was slow.",

Kobe beef, brie (brie makes everything better), prosciutto, and aged balsamic made up this out of this world burger.  Oh, and they top it with a lobster tail!

I was a little annoyed that we had a 10 minute wait when the place was nearly empty (it was past prime lunch hours), but the service and food were very quick, which made up for it.   Our burgers were cooked perfectly medium on soft, homemade buttery buns, and I topped mine with caramelized onions & provolone cheese. Amazing! We split a basket of shoestring fries and waffle fries. The shoestring were better because the waffle fries weren't crispy enough. I'm totally regretting not trying the onion rings, which looked really good. I also saw a table next to us order huge salads, which looked delicious.   The burgers do not come with fries, but you can order a combo or baskets to split. You save about $1 on each item with your player's card. There are plenty of TVs around the restaurant for sports lovers.",

    "text": "I would say that the median rating for this restaurant of 3.5 at the time of this posting is spot on.  The restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel on the walkway towards Bally's.  The cuisine is good and tasty.  The restaurant has a great variety of hamburgers with Kobe and lamb also on the menu and a variety of toppings.  If you enjoy a gourmet style burger, this place is the place for you.    The service is mediocre at best.  I wanted patiently for about 15 minutes for a table for two.  Although I hate waiting, it is a part of life and you live with it.  Once we were at the table it took another fifteen or twenty minutes to order.  Minutes later we got our beverages.  The food took another half an hour to receive.    I understand that good food takes time.  Note: a hamburger in a restaurant does not need that much time unless the establishment runs out of food.  Ridiculous.  The waitress was not attentive.  We did have a coupon for $5 or $10 which softens the blow.  I would recommend the food if you have patience and time to kill.  If not, there are plenty of other restaurants available nearby.",

I understand the surcharge price gouge for \"Vegas\" but even with that I was handed a 10 buck burger not a 22 buck burger.  I ate the rest of the patty only just out of fear that if it was Kobe such that such a meticulously breed beef was not wasted due to the preparation, otherwise I wouldn't have as a third bite.",

My husband and I ate here on Labor Day for dinner and it wasn't very busy.  I actually expected it to have some sort of dress code since it looked like a decent place but they asked if we wanted to sit so we sat! (we were wearing gym shoes).  Also, to my surprise, the waitresses were wearing bustiers which didn't bother me--'tis Vegas after all!   I had a mustard/ketchup incident when I was younger so I always check my seat before I sit down.  There were some crumbs that stuck to my thighs D: but I find that restaurants usually don't clean the seats that often. As usual, we had no idea what to get to drink so we ordered water when are chipper waitress introduced herself.  When she came back with our waters, we put in our drinks--I got the strawberry mint lemonade (very very very delicious) and my husband got a miller since the coors tap was out.  We also put in the pretzels at the same. Pretzels came (they were alright--just pretzels!), and we decided to share the Italian burger (has motz cheese, arugula, and pancetta).  Since I mentioned that we were sharing the burger, they cut it for us and served on a separate plate.  Saved me sooo much time cutting it myself ;) We also ordered a double of fries which was waaaay too many fries. They were so crunchy that I had left over bits in my shirt :D Probably what I sat in earlier!  Our waitress did forget our drinks but they still tasted pretty darn good when we reminded her.  All in all, a good experience, good service, and great food. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different Vegas environment.",

To go with my burger I ordered onion rings for $7.00 only got 6 rings?  Wow.  Before we would get 10 to12 rings stacked high.  My bill came and the waitress forgot to deduct my TR (total rewards discount), I wasn't going to fuss with $2.00, however she asked for my rewards card when I sat down and took it.

We loved, loved, loved the buffalo chicken dip served with a hot pretzel basket.  I make this at home minus the pretzels.  For those who want it hotter a few shakes of tabasco kicked it up, but it had lots bleu cheese in it.  yum!   Also ordered chicken wings (yes, we love chicken, not burgers) and they were served with a nice side of veggies...drizzled in oil and parsleys maybe.  Raw carrot, celery and zucchini (for a little something extra).  Also ordered the mac n cheese hamburger bites.  Again, good.  I would pass, but the others loved them.    The only thing we didn't care for were the onion rings.  They were doughy and bland.  Extremely so.    We also had a pink sauce and an orange sauce for dipping, both excellent.  They were not stingy on the dippies, the portions of veggies or the portions of pretzels.  Often you run out of delivery vehicles and accompaniments.  Not so.    Waitress was great.  Manager checked on table.  A little pricey and burgers were a la carte, so it made a meal twenty bucks each for burgers....but since we decided to use our groupon for a snack meal it worked out great for staying on strip and needing a small bite.  Oh, this food was for four women and we couldn't finish it.  Portions were generous.",

I had the cheeseburger , yes that's its name nothing fancy just A Cheeseburger. It was made with velvetta that gave it an interesting flavor and a pickle that reminded me of grandmother's homemade bread and butter pickles. Condiments are provided on the table such as ketchup and spicy brown mustard but trust me they need nothing else. Mine came a perfect medium on a toasted fresh made bun. She had a Cheeseburger but changed her cheese to a smoked cheddar. I sampled hers and found it delicious as well. Again condiments would have just brought this dish down. On this visit we went with french fries that came with a very interesting in house made condiment that was akin to a wasabi ketchup. The staff was attentive without being overly friendly. Drinks stayed filled and checked on us frequently without being annoying. We found this wonderful place by a groupon offer which left us paying half price. Our first visit was so good we returned 2 days later. This time I had the chicken sandwich and she added bacon to a cheeseburger and switched to velvetta. Our side item choice this time was onion rings which are great but made even better because they are made with Cheeto powder in the batter! Absolutely delighted with this fun choice. Our server Amanda was a bit more friendly on this visit and the service was even better. I only give it 4 because without the groupon offer it would have been a bit pricey for burgers and fries, but we enjoyed it so much I will return each time we come to Vegas even if I have to pay full price. They had very tasty sounding milkshakes that all contained alcohol sadly we were too stuffed to try them but rest assured they will be top of our list on the next visit.",

The only thing I didn't care for was the lack of toppings or the option to \"build your own burger\". Other than that, it was delish.  Service here is where they can really improve on. It took quite awhile for the bartender to acknowledge me, longer to get a beer, and even longer to ask if I was going to eat or not! And there was only one othe person at the bar eating at the time. And the dining room was fairly empty.  I'll be back.",

They give you four choices of fries, fat, skinny, waffle and sweet. The buns are rich. Its a little walk from everything but the Ballys gaming floor (not a complaint, just wear good walkin shoes(or boots that are made for walkin)). Any burger you can get in le poulet, le boeuf,  Le saumon, les legumes. Try it if you cant think of anything else to do on a date. At least you can go for a stroll in the fake streets of Paris.",

    "text": "She got wings she got a halo It seems to me so unnatural Cos that's one thing that I just don't know What seems to be so incredible...at Le Burger Brasserie! - Akon (angel)  Located close to the connector between the entrance of bally's and paris shops, is this cool sports bar. It looks upscale but the prices are very reasonable (especially for vegas) and not to mention there's a ton of tv's with a good view from almost every seat in the restaurant. I ordered the classic burger w/ sauteed mushrooms on a toasted sesame bun (they let you choose your bun and toppings) and while the burger was cooked well, the mushrooms were overly salted. It was also somewhat messy to eat, probably should've used a knife/fork now that i think about it lol. The waffle fries (which you have to order separately) were really tasty though so thumbs up for that. I did however enjoy the exciting football game that was on (although disappointed that the seahawks won). One other thing that i would like to mention is that although the menu has alot of french names for their food, it doesn't seem like this restaurant is french inspired at all...more like an american sports bar with a french theme.  Food: 3.5 stars --- Service: 4 stars --- Atmosphere: 5 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars",

They have happy hour twice a day (4-7 and reverse).  We didn't make it there for happy hour, but I'm still a fan!  Located in the walkway between Paris and Bally's, just outside the Bally's Casino floor.  Cute girls standing outside, good energy and bar atmosphere inside. Our server was nice, nothing too memorable, but like I said we had enjoyed a few cocktails, and I don't remember pissing her off, so she was great!  We ordered a bucket of 5 beers for $20 and the Paris Burger with waffle fries (frites) to split. The burger was scrumptious with Brie and bacon and the waffle fries had great seasoning!  We were pretty full after that, but there was so much more we wanted to try.  The petit frites and the grande frites, sliders, veggie burger, lamb burger, the 777 burger (if someone else is buying), or maybe even the 100 oz beer tower!    Who knows what we'll try when we go back; but one thing is for sure, we WILL go back!",

Next it took longer than it should to get a drink order and a meal order.  We got our food and vacuumed it all down.  It felt on par with a screwy Fuddruckers (not as good as a normal Fudds).  So what is the theme? I did not feel that there was anything special, other than the two lazy ass chicks in the front. Go somewhere else.

This has ruined me for other burgers!  It's a kobe beef burger, topped with 100 year old balsamic vinegar, imported brie, imported proscuitto, carmelized onions and a lobster tail.  First of all, this burger is very big.  Two of us shared it and were stuffed.  So when you look at it relative to the price, it's the same as having 2 entrees at a normal restaurant.  Secondly, it was the best burger I have ever had.  The beef was so tender and delicious, it melted in your mouth.  Add in the toppings (including the perfectly cooked lobster tail), and it was heaven!!!!  We actually considered going back for a second one later in the trip just because we knew we could not get one back home.    As far as the other items on the menu, we tried an appetizer combo, which was very good (loved the wings).  We also tried an order of skinny fried, which were OK (I'm not a huge fry person).",

The Paris burger with caramelized onion and Brie was well-prepared - but I can do better with ingredients from Safeway, and the raved-about waffle fries from other reviews were very obviously straight out of a frozen bag. Pickle was quite good, though. Living in San Francisco has spoiled me. Beers on tap were mostly your standard domestic fare; Bud, Miller Lite, etc. - at least they had Stella and Sam Adams...  Staff was pretty on-the-ball and quite friendly, if I could give them four stars separately, I would.  However, given the chance for a do-over - I'd go back to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay. Much better beer selection, better ingredients.",

We substituted the type of cheese on the burgers without any problems.  My ice tea was continuously refilled and the fries were hot and fresh.  The waitress chatted amicably.  We had been here before and found it to be consistent with previous visits.  I would recommend Le Berger if you want a casual meal in the Paris hotel.",

There are several screens located around the restaurant and at the bar, inluding one large screen at the bar, for your sports viewing pleasure.

Ironically the table next to us had a waitress who was very attentive and made many many passes.  Right before we were about to get up and ask for a manager, our waiter came by and said \"Oh the kitchen has been running through all the larger parties orders but YOURS is next for sure\".  I can deal with 12 bucks for a burger a la carte but it needs to come with better service than your average Dennys.  Not sure about a return visit.

Choices. I ordered their Clam Chowder soup....wow! Wow! I think this was definitely the best clam chowder soup I've had in my life. Honestly. We also ordered chicken wings, their burger (which looked so tasty and juicy) and a couple of other items. I can't remember all of them. Service was amazing! She was so friendly and talkative. Made us feel very comfortable. The food and prices are great. I will definitely be back here once I'm in Vegas again. Thank you so much!!!",

Our hostess on our last visit was friendly and seated us immediately. If you come at a busy time, you may have to wait. It's situated between the Paris Casino Hotel and Bally's Casino so you can valet park at either place.   We all ordered burgers...I ordered one with caramelized onions, Brie cheese and bacon. It is delicious! It was juicy and cooked medium rare the way I like it. We shared fries and have had onion rings in the past. They are both very good. We ordered our fries extra crispy and that's the way they were, nice and hot! They also have grilled chicken and salads if you decide you do not want a burger.   The place is clean and the service is good but can be slow at times. The cost is reasonable for a place on the strip. I will be back!",

We ordered hot wings, onion rings, fries, & a salmon sandwich. All were ala cart items, ok, and pricey. Yes this is Vegas & we don't' mind dining or spending the money. It did not have that wow factor & the sandwich gave me the shits right after!!!   And what ruined it for us was our server Christina who kept calling us & her other customers--\"Doll\", \"Sweetie\", \"Loves\", \"Honey\", \"Hun\", \"Babe\" (eye roll)-- I just don't know you like that....save the 'Flo' bit for Denny's!!!",

    "text": "I've honestly never felt the need to ever rate a restaurant as 1 star, but this place definitely took the prize for one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  The only friendly person was the host who had a friendly greeting and seated us immediately. The prices are relatively appropriate (about $14+ for a burger w/ no sides, $8 appetizers) to the high cost of eating in Las Vegas but it was kind of a bummer that they did not offer combo meals during our visit. There was a table of 8-10 businessmen sitting across from my table and the server in our section was busily helping them. After about 10 minutes after being seated, the waiter came over, took our order, and just zoomed off to help the businessmen group again. We had to flag down another person to ask for waters and our food came after 15 minutes.  I ordered the Italian burger which was mediocre with a medium patty. The flavor was not bad but the patty was on the dry side and the bun was not buttered or prepared in any way at all. The girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken fries, which was essentially old fries with diced Tyson buffalo chicken tenders bathed in buffalo sauce and crumbled bleu cheese. It looked like a stoners creation and we only managed to take a couple bites before calling it quits. The onion rings are actually AMAZING. They look and tasted freshly battered, fried golden brown, came in a large portion, and well worth the 8 bucks. Apparently it's inconsistent though because other reviews had subpar onion rings.  The biggest issue at this establishment is the service. Sitting across the group of businessmen I can see our waiter going above and beyond with his service by making small talk with the group members, constantly checking if they need refills, and finally bringing out complimentary mini ice cream shakes to the whole group to finish their meal. The same waiter never brought us out waters, never came around to check on our food after it was brought out, and also charged us extra on our receipt so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get it fixed (because he was nowhere to be found).  The restaurant itself is open late and doesn't look too bad from the inside or the outside. However, don't be fooled because the food lacks quality and unless you come in a large group you won't receive any service. I much rather have dinner from a vending machine because it'll be faster, cheaper, and probably just as good tasting.",

I had the south western with corn. My wife had the hot dog with fries. They were great with no complaints. The only thing I would ask Dirt Dog is to put a fresh cucumber, pickle and tomatoes on the side. It helps with the richness of the hot dog. A good Chicago dog would be a great choice on the menu. Great place to eat.  Pricy but good",

When we brought it to the manager's attention he at least took it off the bill.

I was seated by a young woman at a table against the wall in the back behind the servers ' station where all three servers on the floor kept their backs to me. As I was seated behind their station they also had their backsides approximately a foot and a half from my face. After waiting ten minutes I left. I told the woman who seated me why I was leaving and asked if she would have wanted that rear end view while eating lunch. She was like, so what, I could have moved you. I said yes, but you  told me to sit there and there was no service where I could have asked to be moved. She was disinterested in the conversation. This is not the kind of negative service one would expect from a restaurant in Bally's. Two thumbs down for rude and disrespectful service.",

Service from Karli was friendly and efficient, really sweet person. She's easy on the eyes too. Sit on the entrance side of the bar, as this is currently her area.

Bun was soft, buttery, and dusted in cornmeal for texture. The beef was perfectly cooked to order, medium with a bit of pink. The party was soft and juicy with plenty of flavor. The burger was covered with a generous helping of fresh medium bleu cheese which stayed well placed on the patty down to the last bite.  My friend got the Pork no-bone sandwich. Basically shredded pork stringy off the rack of ribs, glued together with light and very slightly spicy BBQ sauce, then lightly breaded (with Panko..?) and quick fried. Served on a toasted long bun. Absolutely delicious. Just like a rack of ribs without the mess.  Actually a better burger than Slaters 50/50! And it takes a lot to say that. (For me anyway)",

I had the burger upgraded to Kobe beef ($5 extra) and it was spectacular! I don't know how to describe the taste of Kobe beef in my mouth but it was something very unique to my taste buds as I have never tasted Kobe beef before. YUM!  So, we shared the Kobe beef burger with Tilamook cheddar, caramelized onions and mushrooms and also waffle fries on the side. We also had an appetizer, the chili Thai wings that were really tasty, not spicy at all...more sweet.   If there was anything that I didn't like about the place was that it was super noisy and the tables were a little too close to each other, where you could hear other peoples conversations...Overall it was a very good experience, the food was great the service was too.",

Over four hours of football, we ordered the Kobe burger, onion ring tower, pick 3 fries, French fantasy martinis, Midnite in Paris, and the beignets.  The food was pretty much bar food that was trying to be fancy.  The burgers were pretty decent and the fried stuff was delicious.  I really liked the criss cut sweet potato fries.  The martinis were delicious and strong.  The beignets were meh.    Overall, a fun time was had by all, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.",

We finally got our food. No one got the French fries they ordered and the waitress was snotty when we asked about them. They finally came when we were done eating. We waited 10 minutes for a drink. Finally we asked to talk to the manager. Who was an asshole to us. He asked what we were trying to negotiate. We said we just wanted him to know how terrible our service had been.

The food on the other hand was excellent! I ordered \"le bleu\" burger and my wife just a regular burger with American cheese. Mine was delicious! It's made with bleu cheese, avocado, and smoked applewood bacon on a your choice of bun. The meat of the burger itself was very tender and juicy! I don't believe it was Kobe beef either(they have \"le kobe\" burger). Whatever type of beef it was, it was PRIMO! Our waitress was very helpful and always made sure our drinks were full. All in all, a pleasurable dining experience and would recommend Le Burger Brassier to any gourmet burger lover! Just wish there was more of a beer variety, but I think McDonalds should have a beer variety lol",

It's classy and fun. However, because this sports burger joint is inside paris, every item on the menu starts with \"Le\". It gets to the point where it just sound silly.  Le classique burger is a Carls jr. grade burger and their fries are super over-fried and dry...probably was fried in the morning.   I'm not trying to hate on a men's joint....if this is a Hooters, then make it a Hooters, don't put a \"Le\" in front of it and charge $13 for $3 quality burger.

Looked like a fancy place from far, but from looking at the menu, it  was reasonable and they served FRITES. Too bad you have to order it in addition to your burger - so less one star for that.  Our server wasn't the most friendliest and most attentive. He wasn't mean or anything, just a little stale.  In fact, I was a little jealous of the tables around us because their waiter was so friendly and personable. I remember thinking \"I wish we had him.\"  I've had better burgers elsewhere like Armadillo Willys (at half price burger Saturdays) or Red Robin.  Frites were ok, may be a little too crunchy  all shoe string like for my taste.  I kinda like soft hot centers.  Not sure I'll be running back to this place.

    "text": "Had read they had one of the best burgers in Las Vegas, so decided to check them out. A rough start - no one helped me at the bar, so I went out to the hostess stand to be seated in the dining room. Nice, comfortable booths and TVs are pretty much viewable from any seat, if you want to watch sporting events. Another rough start with the server as it took five minutes to get my club soda. Those service issues aside, they make a really good burger - I had the Paris Burger, which was topped with bacon, carmelized onions and Gruyere. Their fries are also pretty good. Downside is, their \"cone\" basket of fries is an extra $7 - it doesn't even come with the $14 burger! So all in you can expect to drop $30 per person for burger, fries and soda. Granted it's on the Strip, so that's sort of to be expected. I'll probably pass on going back - just too many good burgers around, and for a lot less money.",

Get it cooked medium, which makes for a juicy finger-licking experience.  Their fries aren't bad, but the portions are big enough for two to share.

I ordered the hot wings as an app and was very impressed with them. I haven't had great wings in a long time and they were cooked perfectly and were quite large.  I have never had a Lamb burger so I wanted to try it. I must say it was probably the best burger I ever had in my life. It was really that good!!!! I was really amazed of the tenderness and taste, with virtually no game taste. My buddy ordered the Kobe burger with waffle fries. The burgers were cooked very well and the price was just right, about $20 per person. In Vegas for what we ordered, that is a definite win.   The only thing that I was disappointed with was the service. It literally took 10-15 minutes for someone to come to our table and get our orders. There weren't that many patrons in the restaurant so it was quite upsetting to me.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone but keep in mind that the service is really not at all great so be prepared to sit a long time.",

Combine that with the fact that they almost messed up the temperature of my artisan burger, I should only give them 2.5 stars.  The \"skippy\" who \"85'd\" my burger dropped a tray full of draft beers about 5 minutes later, so I had the last laugh. Skip eating here simply for the fact that you have to order fries separately from the burger.  Are they really going out of business? Maybe, but I just changed the review to two stars.  I run at least two miles a day.  They just charged me triple what I should have paid, should be zero stars.  It's always good to know that my insights are center-mass and dead-on accurate!  Thx!  Also, there's a big difference between pig Latin and au francais.  In reading subsequent reviews, I guess that if you throw dog food on the floor, people will lick it up.",

We showed up a few mins before game time, told the hostess we wanted a table with a view of the Laker game. They were more than accommodating. Our server was amazing, she was there if we needed her, but was not on top of us to rush us alone. One of the amazing things is after we finished eating, she told us we can take our time, enjoy the game and leave when ever we wanted. We stayed through the entire game. One final note, they have the most beautiful waitresses I've ever seen in a restaurant.",

The burger (with provolone cheese, grilled mushrooms/onions) was good but not anything amazing.  The caramelized onion bun was fresh but a little dry, it needed a little bit of mayo or dressing.     The petite frites (skinny fries) were surprisingly lacking in flavor, it needed more salt or seasoning.     As for the Parisian themed outfits they make the girls wear (white booty shorts, go-go boots), there are a few of the gals sporting muffin tops who really need to order their tops one size larger (sorry, I am just being honest).      A burger, fries, chicken wings and 2 diet cokes was $30 before tip.   We were in and out of there in about 25 minutes flat, so it's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat that is a step up from the hotel cafes.",

I find Cold Stone's ice cream to be fairly sub-par compared to Ben and Jerry's and even Baskin-Robbins, but it's the endless possibilities and creativeness that make it fun and a tasty treat.  That being said, I certainly don't think that the Brassier burgers are sub-par. The actual patty - I've experienced a turkey and lamb burger - has been good.  Not amazing, but good.  I was hoping for a really game-y experience upon ordering the lamb burger, but it wasn't the lamb experience I was expecting.  The toppings are great - a gourmet variety including brie cheese, harissa hot sauce, buffalo sauce (on a chicken dish), cranberry sauce, caramelized onions, and on and on.  And the bun choices are also fun.  Fries are crispy and salty, just great.    This is not a place I would normally re-visit, as I'm usually attracted to more ethnic restaurants.  However, Le Burger Brasserie is creative enough to keep my interest piqued and comfortable enough during lunch to spend however long I need to devour a tasty burger.",

Our real reason we went here was to watch the Lakers v. Nuggets b-ball game.  There's a couple giant screen TVs (over 100 inches) and then the place is surrounded by HD flat screens.  They also serve 100 ounce 30 dollar beers (not sure what flavors) and the bring them out in these really cool bong looking containers, not to mention 4-7 happy hour with 2 for 1s.  The only draw back to that is that you have to go up to bar to be able to get the drink special, kind of lame....  Big, juicy burgers, and a hot-naughty wait staff, lots of TVs, 2 for 1s... if there's a game you're looking for, come and check out this place, it's great for the 'typical guy guy'.",

Terrible idea because there are sooo many amazing places to eat in the area- this was just really a waste. We were told there was a wait even though the restaurant was pretty much completely empty. The service was ridiculously slow (again in an almost empty restaurant). We ordered the cheetos onion rings and they were HORRIBLE. The batter wasn't fully cooked and was falling off and there was so much grease on it. Not to mention it was $6 for 5 onion rings that we ended up not eating. The rest of the food was ok but nothing memorable. They were trying a new menu which had no vegetarian options. The ambiance is also really weird- it's like an American sports bar but waitresses are dressed in french-inspired racy costumes. It really crashed with the Parisian theme have a sports/burger joint. Overall, not a great experience.",

Then we had the hamburger and philly cheese steak sandwich entrees. Both were really tasty! Our waitress was very good with prompt, friendly, and attentive service. My only problem was that our onion ring tower was served only mildly warm, but I did not want to complain and have them heated up as we were already getting very full! There were many tasty looking choices on the menu, we were sorry we didn't get back this trip. Next time! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "We came because of the Groupon deal. I think it is a good decision.  We had a beet and goat cheese salad that is so good that we cannot stop enjoying the dish. It contains regular and golden beet. It is very refreshing as the dressing is light and sweet.  The burger we ordered is the salmon burger. It is a big piece of good salmon. I usually am not so passionate about salmon. But this one make me want to have more. The salmon is fresh and the meat is juicy and soft.   We ended the dinner with a trio sorbet. There are three scoops of sorbet with raspberry, mango and coconut. The sorbet is thick and tasted like fresh fruit. We enjoyed them so much. I was a bit annoyed at the time it took to prepare the dessert dish. We wait additional 20 min just to get the sorbet after the meal.  In all, we like the food very much. Even without the Groupon deal, I think the price range is reasonable with the quality of food you get.  The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because of the service. When we came in, we were led to a very small 2 person table with a few shopping bags on hand. We asked for a larger table so we can put things away and eat comfortably. Then we were pointed to a table by the entry door and service station that has a lot of foot traffic and no privacy. So we asked again to be seated more inside as we saw there was an empty booth adjacent to inner wall. The waitress just looked at us and said that it is not cleaned. We were then just said \"forget it\" and sit uncomfortably on that noisy table. But honestly speaking, why can't she make any effort to accommodate customer's request? How hard would it be to ask someone to clean up the table? There are a lot of ways to better handle the situation than simply decline customer's wish. If not for that Groupon deal and also it is the last day we are in town to be able to use it, we could have missed all the good food and just left.",

However, the grind on the lamb left a little to be desired - I had a few hard bits in the burger.  The fries were crispy and tasty.  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.  They are in no hurry to get your food or your bill to you quickly.  For being billed as a sports bar (there are tvs with sports playing), it doesn't have service like most sports bars.  Plan to have a leisurely meal if you go.    I would go again for a reasonably priced meal on the strip.",

The French Dip Cheesesteak was very impressive. The Au jus served on the side was so awesome, that I asked for second serving, and I pretty much just drank the second cup.

You can order a  burger with a beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, or salmon patty.  They have a full list of toppings and condiments you can add onto your burger.  The list includes regulars such as cheeses, avocado, bacon, and grilled onions to the obscure and unique such as crabmeat, grilled shrimp, and even seared foie gras.  My favorite treat at this restaurant is the selection of 3 different kinds of fries.  You can choose between shoestring, steak, and waffle cut fries or a combination of your choice between the 3.  The salads and desserts are almost an afterthought but they are all excellent.  I recommend the beignets, the French \"doughnut\" -- deep-fried pastry dough sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I have stopped by Le Burger Brasserie whenever I happen to be in town.",

It was the most digusting chicken burger I've ever tasted. The chicken tasted very artificial, almost like styrofoam or something. It just didn't taste like chicken at all. Sadly, a McDonald's McChicken taste way better, however, I don't like McChickens.  There were small pieces of bones insinde the chicken, so I ended not finishing my burger. Without a doubt, the chicken patty was frozen stuff from Costco or something.  It was very poor value as the burger cost almost 15 dollars yet it came with no fries or anything else.  Service was friendly and food was delivered to the table quickly, but again, quality was very disappointing.",

For starters, you have a variety of options to build your own burger. You can pick what kind of bun you want, what kind of cheese, what toppings, etc. My favorite creation is the blue cheese burger on a roasted tomato bun w/mushrooms, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo and ketchup (disgusting I know, but so delicious!). Their fries are also really good and the fry sampler is large enough to share with a group.",

It had lots of clam chunks in it and had just the right texture.  The tower of onion rings were also good.  This place prides itself on its burgers and has a wide selection of types of meat patties you can get (beef, chicken, turkey, veggie, lamb) or the type of bun you get.  Sides are a la carte, so if you want something with your burger, it will cost extra.  Most of the burgers come with one free topping, and extra toppings will also cost extra.

Nothing special inside, although there is a 15 ft screen on the wall showing the game over the bar.  Otherwise, a typical sports/restaurant bar type place with decent prices I might add.  Typical 1/2 lb beefy burgers are $11-$19 depending on what you get.  I got the Le Paris, but without the brie, since I'm not a fan of it.  I got it with American instead.  The burger itself is very good, juicy, dripping in fat.  On top of that, their beer bucket is $20 for 5 beers, can't beat that in Vegas.  I got the waffle fries, which were seasoned well.",

Your girlfriend/wife gotta have a sense of humor though as the staff is tastefully, scantily clad. Wandering eyes are inevitable. I went three times last week during a convention I had to attend for work, and it was well worth it every time. I'm a picky eater when it comes to burgers, and everything they do is excellent, right down to the bloody marys. In addition to being gorgeous, Karli is quick and polite. She was working the bar every time I came in, thank god. In layman's terms, she is the shit. Tons of big screens throughout if you want to watch a game, and great happy hour specials, including beer buckets. a lot of really comfortable booths that provide more than adequate privacy, should you so desire.   I don't know what they do to the lamb, but the flavor is a lot better than anywhere else I've ever had one. Melt in your mouth goodness, consistently. The steak fries are perfect as well.   Cheers",

Consistency is so important when I eat somewhere. I always want to know that whatever I'm getting is going to be just as good as the last time. And this place always delivers. The service is good too. Everyone is always really nice and accommodating but not overbearing. The only thing about this place I wish for is more liveliness. It's quiet and its a sports bar/restaurant. It really needs a better location. It's stuck back in a quiet corner of Paris and there isn't enough foot traffic to really fill the place. When I go to a sports bar/restaurant, I like at least a little excitement. Needless to say, there's always a table and service is quick.",

I sat at the bar (side bar: when I walked up to the hostess and said it was for one, she asked if I wanted to sit at the bar instead. At the time I did want to sit at the bar, so I take no offense, but solo diners want to sit at tables too!), and the bartender/waitress wasn't the friendliest person ever, but I survived. I'd probably much rather go to BLT at Mirage, or In-N-Out instead.   Also, there was an older (40-50 ish) woman there, who clearly must have kids, because she apologized after every curse word she loudly yelled at the football game on the giant screen.",

    "text": "This place, located closer to Bally's than to Paris, has pretty good burgers. I opted for the Le Bleu (I like bacon and avocado, but asked for it without the namesake cheese) and found it to be very flavorful on the onion bun. At $12 without any side (all sides are a la carte) it was a tad bit pricey but not too bad for Vegas and the ordered toppings were not skimped on, with my burger being topped by a full half of an avocado and three medium thickness cut (the good stuff!) flavorful bacon.  My buddy who was with me had the Salmon burger and said it was pretty good, but complained about the fact we did not go to the buffet, I reminded him the line was nearly an hour long and that changed that.   The servers, though scantily clad, are efficient and courteous. The kitchen seemed to be a little slow, taking about twenty minutes to prepare our food (cooked medium...but slightly overcooked) despite the eatery being pretty empty.  The beer selection is not outrageously priced but nor is it too great of a beer list and the lack of a line was nice. There are televisions throughout the establishment which makes me believe it may get pretty busy during large sporting events with people drinking Miller Lite, of which ads are plastered all over the place.  If you want lunch and don't want to wait in a line to be able to sit down this is a good option to consider, though I still much prefer Houston's California Burger and just about anything at the Counter to this place, this has nudged in to the top five of best burgers i've had...and I've had hundreds.",

I like the music they play and the fact that you could watch sports. Even though I like the outfits the staff wears, call me crazy, but the little shorts the females wear could be a tad less short since personally I don't like being eye level with their cellulite thighs and buttcheeks while I'm having a meal. Once again, maybe if I were an \"assman\" this would have been a non-issue.   The bib lettuce, Gruyere and apple salad is DELICIOUS. It has the most fantastic mustard dressing. A stand out burger for me was the one with caramelized onions, bacon and brie on a caramelized onion bun. I like that you get to build your own burger if you wish and that you have multiple types of buns, toppings and sauces to choose from. My favorite burger here has been the lamb burger! I have also tried the fries, buffalo wings and banana bignets. All top-notch. This is an all around solid establishment!",

We decided to have supreme de poulet-chicken breast cordon bleu sandwich and steak et fromage-french dip cheesesteak.  The food was good nothing to rave about but I would have preferred to try the hamburgers; however, my husband suggested we stick to the \"deal\" we had gone in for since it was a bit pricey.  Rather than leave we decided to stay; food was good, service was quick & employees were attentive, clean restaurant, with lots of TVs.

We came in and sat at the bar around 9:40 pm (somehow there wasn't a hostess around to direct us) and the bartender realized we had no clue what was going on so he asked if we wanted some drinks. We asked for cocktail menus as well as food menus and he informed us the kitchen closes at 10pm. We looked through the menus and gave him our drink and food selections and he ensured us he got all the orders in before the kitchen closed. Lets fast forward an hour. The food still hasn't come and now it's around 9:50pm and we ask about our food order. He says \"oh, the servers didn't bring you your food?\" Umm no. He goes off and says something about it bring their fault and he'll check with the kitchen. He comes back in 2 minutes with a salad that we ordered and said it would be in him. Ok things were looking a little better. We didn't receive the combo appetizer we ordered but hey, at least now we could finally get some food in our stomachs.   Fast forward another round of drinks and we ask for our check - happy hour drink specials are annotated on the check. But so was the salad. What happened to \"the salad will be on me?\" Then he asks us if we're in Vegas the next day because if we come back, dinner is on him. Ummm if tonight's salad wasn't on you even though you already said it would be, what makes me believe tomorrow night's dinner is going to be on you?   I didn't come to Vegas to be swindled out of money by the bartender - on the casino floors maybe - but definitely not here.   I hope this was just an outlier experience - but I won't be coming back to see if that's the case during this trip.",

I traded the salt patty for a salad that was equally inedible. No one could finish their meal. Who ever runs this place needs to be sent back to the three dollar burger joint they came from.

But, I was just here for food and drinks. BF had a beer, I had two Malibu & Coke's. They were nice and strong. The bartenders helping us were friendly and attentive.  For lunch we split a Steak et Fromage sandwich. It was a Philly Cheesesteak with roasted red peppers, mushrooms and shallots, and served with au jus sauce. The best of both worlds, I love cheesesteak and I love French Dip.   The sandwich was really good, and quite large, it was a perfect size for both of us to finish without still feeling hungry. And, it was only $14.99 - cheap lunch for two :)  Since we sat at the bar, we didn't get the full menu, but everything on the bar menu seemed good.

I asked the waitress if she's sick of everyone asking about it and she certainly was. It's a ridiculous, pretentious waste of money; something they stuck on the menu to give this spot a bit of notoriety. According to her, they've sold only a couple. Most of that cost comes from the Dom Perignon that accompanies the burger.   Happy hour rules here, though. Two-for-one drinks are the best kind of special.

Horrid horrid service, the broad got three of our four beer orders wrong. She lost our credit card for a short while. But she was hot... And I was happy to find a super bomb menu item, the Hot Dog Sliders! Mini dogs on pretzel buns, with bacon, spicy mustard and onion strings... BOMB!!!   I'll continue to hit up Le BB out of convenience and having above average food. 3.5 stars.",

(i think the wait was for the relish on the dog, which is always fresh).  food finally came and it was good, but the best part? our meal ended up being discounted for the long wait. this place get a star solely on great customer service. i would go back.",

    "text": "4 for service 2 for food.  Came on a Monday night with a groupon and my total rewards card.  If you have the card, you pay the 1.00 cheaper price for each option.    Wasn't in the mood for a veggie burger( don't eat beef) and my girl didn't want to split the chicken burger so we ordered some apps and a salad.   Soft and crisp pretzels with a beer cheese sauce and a beer mustard tator tots with cheese, speck, green onions hot dog sliders chicken cesar salad.  Pretzels 9.00  The pretzels were really disappointing.  They were not soft pretzels, they were pretzel BUNS.  The same freaking buns that the hot dogs sliders were served on.  Oh, I can't forget the 2 pretzel rods that were on the plate( the crisp selection).  Very expensive for a some pretzel rolls and 2 pretzel rods.  The cheese sauce and mustard were very boozy( good if you like beer).  We took the rods with us, tried to eat them the next day by the pool and they were staler than shit.   Tots 9.00 These weren't so much tots as they were leftover mashed potatoes, zushed up with cheese, ham, and green onions. Then, mold them into a large tater tot shape and throw them in the deep fryer.  Did not like these at all.  Salad  Lots of chicken, not that much cheese, croutons, dressing.  Basic, 14.00  Hot dog sliders  Smallish dogs, wrapped in bacon, thrown on a pretzel roll that was slathered in margarine, topped with small fried onions.  I didn't eat these( don't eat beef), my wife said they \"ok\"  Maybe we should have gotten a burger?  We might have fared better.  They were running a special, a make your own burger, fries or rings and a soda for 25.00.  They only carry pepsi products so that didn't sound good to us.     We had a groupon, 20 for 40.00.  We spent 1 extra dollar, plus tax and a generous tip since service was really good.    That's about all I can say for this place.  I enjoyed my 6.49 cents sandwich from Earl of Sandwich last night a lot better than this meal.",

We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed.   I ordered the \"Chopped Salad\" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!",

They had a variety of burgers to choose from or you could create your own. Which I did. I had a kobe beef burger (a $5 upcharge) with brie, gruyere, mozzarella, grilled onions, mushrooms, and a garlic aoli on an artisian bun with Cheetos dusted fries. C'est Magnifique! The burger was medium and juicy and the cheese was melty and spectacular. I was a little underwhelmed by the fries, I expected more from the Cheetos dust. But it was a great experience and next time I hope to try another restaurant at Paris.",

    "text": "I visited \"Burger Brasserie\" Labor Day weekend 2017. I was touring the Strip. By the time I began walking the Bally's property, I realized I was hungry--the type of hungry where I wouldn't distinguish between a $20 meal, versus a $40+ meal.   I stumbled upon this restaurant--attracted to a posted \"special $19.95 combo\": your choice of their standard hamburger or cheeseburger; your choice of fries or onion rings; and a pint of draft beer. I stepped in, curious to see what I might receive.   The restaurant's complete menu, with pricing, is posted on their website. The bottom line is that regardless of the special pricing, the taste, texture and flavor of the cheeseburger and fries was great. The portions were good enough to satisfy my hunger, without leaving me uncomfortably \"stuffed\".  The staff provided great service. And as I was dining alone at the bar, my bartender/server was a great host-conversationalist in between fulfilling bar orders.  Here's my bottom line: There seems to be a trend in Las Vegas to have burger restaurants affiliated with celebrity chefs. You'll pay a premium for that dining experience--but I don't think you'll necessarily get a better meal, or get better service.",

The hostess said it was a 45 minute wait for a booth and a 15 minute wait for a table. There were plenty of open tables and booths so I don't know what the deal was. We waited patiently and after 15 minutes we were seated at a small table right where you walk in. I asked if we could sit at one of the other open spots and was told it would be a wait. I am assuming thet just didn't have enough staff or something.   Our server was great and checked on us often. The $4 charge for a pepsi was a rip though. I ordered a combo meal for $22 that got me any burger, fries, and shake. I chose the Le Paris Burger and it had brie cheese, caramelized onion and applewood smoked bacon. The burger didn't have much flavor and disappointingly seemed to be a frozen patty but the brie cheese and bacon were good. My waffle fries would have been better if they didn't come out cold. My peanut butter shake was the best part of the meal and 5 stars alone. The service and shake were good but for a place with \"burger\" in their name.....the burger should have been more of the star than the bacon that came on it.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas I stumbled across the Burger Brasserie while exploring the Las Vegas strip and the neighboring shops.  As I walked in the place was fairly empty and when I asked for a table was told there would be a short wait.  After about 10 minutes I was called to the front and taken to a seat at the bar.  I explained to the hostess that I would prefer a table even the small two seater and they reluctantly sat me at a small table nearby next to the bar.  My gut was telling me after this to leave but I was extremely hungry and the menu looked appealing so I hesitantly took the seat at the bar.  My server Christina was friendly enough to begin and took my drink order quickly.  It then took about 10 minutes to get my Pepsi and have my order taken.  I placed an order for the Cilantro Lime Chicken Skewers and they took about 20 minutes to come out from the kitchen.  When my food arrived my drink was near empty but was not offered a refill by the server and instead the bartender (I didn't get his name) saw it and asked what I was drinking and quickly brought me another.    My server walked by my table about a dozen times or more but never stopped to see how anything was or ask if I needed anything further.  I was not offered any additional items and even had to track down another server to ask for my bill so I could pay and go.  I was at the table for well over an hour for a single Pepsi and skewers (which had decent flavor but lacked anything to put it over the top).    The pricing was quite reasonable for the food but the flavors were a bit lacking and the service from Christina was as poor as can be for me.  I did notice her larger parties got plenty of attention and service but me being alone seemed to put me in a lower class for service.  I normally tip very well but I was so fed up with this place and the wait that I simply left a $20 on the table and made my way out of the place.  I actually was looking at getting an additional dessert item but was never offered and didn't feel they deserved my business.  Overall the service was a 2 star (the 2nd being the bartender stepping up big time for refills and making sure I was okay when he saw that I was getting frustrated) and the food was actually quite good.  The place may look nice but when you get treated as a second class citizen because you aren't part of a larger party is a bit concerning and I probably would not return in the future.",

My wife had a Paris burger that was well cooked, juicy and flavorful.  I had the French dip on Kevin's recommendation and it did not disappoint.  The cheese was unobtrusive and the dip was a perfect compliment when soaking the French bread.  Some dips can be too salty, but not this one.  It was perfect.  We split the Almond joy desert and it was just the right size for us.  Very light with good consistency and multiple chocolate tastes.

They are located between Balley's  and Paris in the middle section that connects them and is right before you enter Balley's.  Burger was super moist and tender.  There are a ton of TV's for watching sports and very friendly staff.  I will definitely return on my next trip.",

Our server came by soon after we were seated, and she was very nice throughout our entire service.  The manager even stopped by to see how everything was going.  We each ordered a burger and shared a half of each one. We had the regular cheeseburger and a limited time special (I think it was the spicy nacho cheeseburger).   The regular cheeseburger was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The pickles balanced the sandwich out in a very pleasant way.     I love spicy food, and therefore enjoyed the spice on the other burger; however, I think that the spice may actually take away from the delicious flavor of the burger on this selection.  Either way, overall a very good experience.  I would return again.",

I had a DIY burger and when it came out, I had no idea how to eat it. It was HUGE. I ended up knife and forking it, and even then I could only eat half! The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and they don't skimp on the toppings. There was a whole avocado and least 4 pieces of crispy bacon. The fries are big enough to share and came out piping hot and crispy. They're served with a slightly spicy, smoky ketchup. Last but not least, if you have any room leftover get the Cap'N Crunch milk shake. It is delicious.",

Never asked us how our food was, or how we were doing. We waited roughly 6 minutes to get drinks before she came to our table. In the meantime, two other people walked out because they were not served in time. Appetizers took roughly 20 minutes to come out! Although they did come out hot and were pretty good, this was a little long for wings. Entrees came out two minutes after our appetizer arrived. Hamburgers were ordered medium well and were beyond well-done. Will not eat here again.",

We started out with the fried cheese, and no not just your normal Mozzarella..... 2 pieces of fried Mozzarella, 2 pieces of fried American cheese, AND 2 pieces of fried Pepperjack cheese. And it was SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!! The American and Pepperjack were different, the only thing I would request is to either make the pieces a little larger or add a few more pieces of cheese, because for the price they charge I don't think the portion is equal to the price.   We all had a few beers and ordered burgers. Their burgers are served on homemade buns with different flavors baked in including: Caramelized Onion, Parmesan, Wheat, and a few others that I know I am forgetting.   I got a burger cooked medium-rare with Cheddar cheese, Caramelized Onions, and Bacon on a Caramelized onion bun. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and tasted absolutely phenomenal. My friend got the Kobe Beef Burger and was actually a little disappointed. It was overcooked and really not the way a Kobe Beef Burger should taste. We also got an order of Pommes Frites for the 4 of us to share. The fries were not too fabulous but they were good.  All in all awesome food. great drinks, good service!!!",

She ended up getting a salad this time and seemed to enjoy it.  My burger was pretty plain.  No frills.  That being said, the patty was seasoned enough so that it didn't need a lot of help in the condiments department.  That being said, while it was good, I don't think I would crave it unless I already happened to be in the Paris hotel and casino.  WHAT I ORDERED:   Le POULET (salad) - 3/5 pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular  Le CLASSIQUE (burger) - 3/5 solid patty, adding a special sauce might push it to 4/5  Sweet Potato Fries - 4/5 how can you go wrong with these?  STAFF: Exceptional.  Our waitress was attentive and genuinely sweet.  WAIT TIME: No wait time Saturday around 6:30pm  PORTION:  Hearty sized burger.  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK  The portions and quality of burger match the price well.  WOULD I RETURN  Probably not",

We walked passed the line of a hundred people for the buffet, and came across Le Burger Brasserie, which we had tried before and liked. There was no wait (woohoo!), so we chose to dine here.   The environment is cool here because they have like 40,000 TVs with various college football games playing (Saturdays, obviously), so when your group is quiet from being hung over, there is still lots of entertainment.   The burgers generally are pretty good. Le Paris, the burger my BF & I both ordered, was really undercooked, and my BFs was overcooked, so we switched patties to save time. (That True love right there.)   The fries are intense. We had a party of four, so we got all three choices to share, and that was WAY too many fries for us. We ate maybe half. I'd stick with just the waffle fries and skinny fries next time.   Our service was sporadic, and it took a while to get the check.   It's nothing life-changing, but it's a good choice for when you need some food to feed that hangover, and the line for the buffet almost ends in front of this restaurant. I'd come back.",

Because the waitress took 5-10 minutes to come to us  after being flagged down (none busy hours), I rate this place 4-stars.",

We ordered a couple of draft beers and two burgers, with two fries and a side of gravy. Our beer was flat, the burgers were okay, and we only received one order of fries (no gravy).  We called over another server (Was ours on break?  We didn't see her for most of our meal) and said that we needed cutlery and another order of fries (and our gravy).  We were told that she would let our server know.  I guess she never did. My husband had to walk around the restaurant and take cutlery off of other tables.  We decided to just eat our food and forgo the other order of fries, and the gravy. Towards the end of our meal, the manager walked by us and gave us a thumbs up from across the restaurant.  I guess this was his way of checking in?  We quickly payed our bill and left as soon as possible.  Upon checking the receipt afterwards, we noticed that we were not granted our total rewards points. We will not be back.  There are many other places to have a good burger in Vegas...do not waste your time here.",

    "text": "It is easy to miss this early adopter to the \"gourmet\" burger craze currently in full swing. Burger Brassiere is located in the walkway that connects the Bally's and Paris hotels. While actually closer in proximity to Bally's, it is in fact part of the Paris property.   it is as much a sports bar as anything with a large bar area booth seating throughout the restaurant.  You are never out of TV view and there is always a game playing on the flat screens.  I like Burger Brasserie for a few reasons, they do have a quality burger and some clever sides at a reasonable price, they have a beverage HH everyday from 4-7, and they offer discounts to total rewards members. The biggest complaint is just the noise level and the fact they can get very busy to the point of it effecting service. Anyhow it is a great place to grab a draft and a burger and enjoy a game. In my opinion it beats the sports book at both Bally's and Paris.  I have been several times over the years and it's been a while. My last visit recently was a pleasant reminder that they do a reasonably good job of the sports bar theme with some very nice comfort food.  I mixed it up this time and ordered the very rich and decadent  French Onion Burger caramelized onions, gruyere gratinee.  It comes dry so the condiments are up to you. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was pillowy soft. A touch of Dijon  Mustard and this puppy rocked.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#r_s8PTg5rBhtgUoGTZZwGA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#nbckoyMUu_oHOtiWLOXziQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a> The cheesebuger mac n' cheese bites are sinful to be sure, and a great appetizer to share. They are filling and pack a calorie punch so be prepared.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-brasserie-las-vegas#VCe6IjVG4RZVXkdidCyV_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a> I will definitively go back for a spot to watch that game in an inviting, quality venue like BB every time. Did  I mention they are pretty consistent? Well they are and kudos for that, see you again BB.",

Burger Brasserie offers a French interpretation of a classic American staple - the hamburger - in a lovely sports bar environment. The restaurant is convenient to both Bally's and Paris because it's located on the promenade connecting the two Las Vegas hotels. The decor and ambiance were excellent.  She enjoyed her cheeseburger, fries and house salad. I avoid cheeseburgers and fries normally and prefer nutritious foods. Therefore, I did not like the burger and fries. The salad was fresh and tasted good. An added benefit was that Total Rewards credits were accepted to pay for the meal.",

Delicious tender beef shreds in a brown gravy over fries. I'm going to try to recreate that recipe at home with short ribs in the Crockpot.  We also had the buffalo dip. It was delicious and very rich loaded with chucks of blue cheese. They serve it with pretzel bread, crostini, pretzel sticks, and celery. The food was just fabulous.

    "text": "Walking through Paris shortly after checking in we were  enticed by the 2 for 1 happy hour special.   Two friends ordered Kobe beef burgers and I had a pretzel appetizer. Of course we shared several 23oz beers at the 2 for 1 price.   The food was delicious. The Kobe burgers got rave reviews from my friends, and the pretzels were a nice size snack at a reasonable price.   As is the case with almost every Vegas establishment that isn't $$$$, service was pretty terrible. But we managed and had a good time.   If you came to spend some real money, they have a $777 burger with Kobe beef, Foie Gras, goat cheese, pancetta, lobster, and 100 year aged balsamic. Oh yeah, it also comes with a bottle of Dom perignon champagne. If you order a tower of beer (not A part of the 2 for 1) you get to spin a wheel and can win a 1/2 off entree. If you're feeling lucky in Vegas maybe you can get one of these burgers at half price!",

When I arrived the lady informed even with my TR status I would be waiting at least 30 minutes. I walked over to the dining area and saw plenty of open areas. I wasn't in the mood to argue so we opted for the food court at the Ballys. Hostess was just plain rude",

Wait till you've tried these delicious lye dipped bread bombs! The unique texture of each is type paired with either beer cheese or whole grain mustard.

They were really good. The chicken was juicy. The flavors all worked together. We really liked them.   We also got the American burger and added bbq sauce. We also really liked out burger. It was messy but good.   To me, this place is kind of a gourmet burger joint. It's not like your shake shack or in n out. It has higher end ingredients.   We would definitely come back. Next time I'd like to try their desserts.",

I had the Paris burger and waffle fries. The fries were delicious and a small order is enough to share between two people. The burger was a little heavy because of the cheese. They used too much in my opinion which made it greasy.   I tried the chicken fingers and Cheetos onion rings as well. The chicken fingers tasted like frozen food quality but the ranch was yummy. The onion rings were alright. The special Cheetos sauce is super spicy!   Overall, I wouldn't come back here but it was worth a try.",

I felt that was sort of shady.    I got the prime rib sliders.  Each slider was TINY, as in barely two bites of food.  The beef didn't taste like anything.  The whole presentation was just sad.

After deliberating for a little bit, I decided to give BB a try. i had a 20 percent off coupon but it was only good until 4pm. it was around 5pm which meant it was happy hour, i still should get a good deal.  For happy hour there was a few people at the bar and it semmed semi busy. Drinks were 50 percent during happy hour so I ordered a Cab-arita which featured don julio blanco tequila, cointreau,  cabernet sauvignon, fresh-squeezed lime sour.  It was a very refrhesing drink. For my meal I wanted something small so i ordered the Angus Beef Sliders, it was $13 and I choose to have one of each. I felt like Gordon Ramsay sampling the menu :) I had a basic cheeseburger style, Shaft's bleu burger-style and the Paris burger-style.  They really hit the spot, I know another yelper did not these but mine were really good.   The mini bun was toasted, which made the roll buttery crunchy. If that's a word. I love my buns toasted   the meat was cooked just right and the toppings were perfect.   The atmosphere was fun as well with several games on the TVs. The bartender was very nice and attentive as well. I think her name was Karli. For two drinks and my sliders I was out the door for just over $30 and that included the tip.   I will be back.",

My wife and I decided to start with the deviled eggs, which were quite good. I ordered the Paris burger, which sounded a bit unusual but not too far from traditional. Big mistake. I don't know if it was the caramelized onions or some kind of sauce, but the sweetness overpowered everything, including the brie, the bacon and especially the meat. If I'm going to spend $13 on a burger I expect to taste beef. Very disappointing. Nobody else in our party reported anything especially bad or especially good. I'd say it was gimmicky and overpriced.",

We ordered the Caesar salad, the American burger, the brisket chile and the Paris burger. Chile was brought out cold. I bit into a piece of brisket and it felt frozen, that is how cold the meat was.  The burgers were delicious with the meat being juicy and tender. The caesar salad was very fresh and crisp, perfect on the taste of the dressing. Coffee was brought out to us with creamer.

I asked for wheat bun, our waitress Christina has a hard time doing her job. She never let me spoke. Didn't listen when I did and she was so rude and not very attentive. She was awful, i never met a person that bad at a job. Anyways she ok ok ok me and got my whole order wrong. I asked for a wheat bread and got white, I asked for shoe string fries and got regular, my bf asked for hot wings and got fried drumsticks. I feel like this whole thing could of been avoided if she wasnt our server. Anyways food sucked she promised to charge me for a grilled cheese since I'm not eating meat, her idea not mine. Charged me extra for a burger at the end that was not what i had ordered. Food was oily and nasty my bf got sick from it our whole trip. Thx Christina  .. employee of the year",

The place looks pretty formal though and they serve the fries in a metal cone so makes me feel out of place for a burger joint. Anywho, this place gets 4 stars for the sheer taste of the burgers. I was with a party of 4 and everyone was delighted with our food. I had the turkey burger and I was not disappointed. My dad mentioned that there was no grease coming from the burgers and he was absolutely correct. This soot was in the Ballys hotel and moderately priced however seeing that you needed to order the fries separate was not ideal. Its a possibility we might frequent this spot again if we are in town",

We started with the Buffalo Chicken Fries (yummy), the Deviled Eggs (excellent), and the Chicago Dog Sliders (tasty).  For there we ordered a few burgers, a Cobb Salad, and the French Dip Sandwich.  All were fresh and delicious.  One of the burgers was a little under cooked, but not too badly.  Our server, Alicia if I remember correctly, was excellent.  She was very friendly, prompt and professional.  I highly recommend this place when you are in the area and craving burgers.",

I added fried egg, bacon, smoked cheddar, and garlic aioli sauce to my burger along with the standard tomato and lettuce. It was excellent! Feel free to steal the combo cuz it might have been the best burger I've ever had! We also ordered some waffle fries to share, and even the waffle fries with their special made dip was excellent. We were very impressed.  Our waiter was very friendly, and took the time to recommend different beers based on what we liked. The services was a bit slow but we were on vacation and didn't really care (especially not after the amazing food).",

When we came, UFC fights, baseball, and football draft were on. We stopped in for a light snack: cilantro lime skewers and Wagyu beef hot dog sliders with Chicago style relish. The skewers were lightly flavored with the lime cilantro and the chicken was a little dry; sliders weren't very flavorful and left much to be desired.  A friend of mine ate here before and raved about their $19 burger, but, for me, I wasn't impressed at all with the food; it did, however, curb our hunger pain.

    "text": "Brews, burgers, and football! That sounds like dinner for me! To the Brasserie!   Now that it's football season, plus Thursday night there's a game on tonight! The Burger Brasserie is one of the rare places located on the strip that allows the twins; whom are under 18. Plus the main television here is so large and can be seen and heard  anywhere seated. All over the restaurant there are televisions so at every angle your not going to miss a thing. Whether it be a fumble, kick off, or touch down your guaranteed to see it.   The Ravens and the Bengals are playing tonight, and if the game was any more vivid I would feel like I was in my own living room. When I approached the restaurant the two ladies at the hostess stand greeted me and exchanged the usual pleasantries. Both of the ladies were friendly and exceptional welcoming. As the hostess walked us to our seat I was given the choice of a few different seating options. The service that the employees provide to the he guest by just being positive and involved is very appealing and appreciated.  The booth was very comfortable and had a birds eye view of the main tele in the middle of the bar. The decor of the restaurant is set in red and black. Black is used with accents of red all throughout the dining room. The menu is a rich red velvet color that opens like that of an old book. The selection of food and beer is amazing. Just to delight the senses; the French know how to celebrate with sporting events. It shows in how the menu was designed here! It's so simple, but yet elegant. Such selections are under appetizers three different kinds of wings with real blue cheese or deviled eggs. It all sounded so delicious.  Surprised the restaurant was not busier or maybe because it was half time for the two football games I placed our order with our fabulous server , Genevieve. The Pulled Pork Sandwich seemed perfect with the football atmosphere of the night. The twins ate the sampler plate of sliders, plus we shared a plate of chicken wings with our meat choices. Dessert is always a must, so it was Almond Joy done the with a french twist.   In order for me to enjoy pork is has to be cooked and presented a certain way. The cooks here have figured out how to do that. The pulled pork was so moist and fell apart as you picked it up. It was served on a soft bun with extra pickles. It had a little bit of sweet bbq, and that sandwich melted in my mouth. Absolutely worth the $13.00 price. The twins sliders were so cute and delicate. It was one of each from on the menu. The best little slider was the done french style to added blue cheese crumbles. Well worth their price too at $13.00.   The wings were in a class all by them selves. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Wings are done best nice and spicy. Then you take that beautiful wing drenched in reddish orange sauce and dip it in ranch to quell the heat. I love to dip wings in bleu cheese too. The server made sure that we had plenty of ranch and blue cheese. There is nothing like bleu cheese crumbles on top of that hot wing then you bite into it with the cheese and dressing mix is so delicious. As you can fathom the wings were a home run. Oh football season right, safe! You get how amazing they were.   We had a delightful experience dining here at the Brassiere. It is a fantastic place to bring the kids to enjoy the game and great eats. The beer is iced cold and the cocktails are just waiting for you to get here to pour over ice. The televisions are nice and loud from everywhere in the restaurant so get down here and get a good seat. Sunday is coming! Who's your team?",

The decor is more like a steakhouse than a typical fast food burger place, and the floor plan is very open.  This restaurant has a large seating area and seems to have high capacity for patrons.   I sat in the bar, however, which has a strange design if you're eating food there.  The bar is set up for draft and bottled beer to be easily accessed by bar staff.  Food orders are brought to one end of the bar and then served on the other end of the bar (in my case).   Service was prompt.  Not friendly, and not attentive, but I saw the food come up and then was served it promptly.   The burgers here are huge.  Probably best to attack it with a knife and fork, or smash it into a manageable size.  I found the burger delicious (and you do have the ability to custom order ingredients) even if oversized.  The onion rings (see photo) are also huge, and are delicious.",

    "text": "Surprisingly good burgers and fries here.  My burger was perfect (crispy iceburg lettuce, tomato slices that actually tasted like tomatoes and not like the bland, anemic red ones sold in grocery stores) and grilled to order. I also asked for avocado on my burger ( you have a choice of toppings) and while the slice was fon the smallish side, it  was ripe and creamy. And the fries were something else - crunchy on the outside, and warm and potatoey on the inside ... mmmmm.  So why not 4 or 5 stars? The service left something to be desired.  Our food took a looooong time to arrive, with no explanation from our waitress as to why. Also, despite my asking several times, she forgot to bring lemon slices for my Coke, and we had to flag her down for refills on our drinks.   The ambience is casual and LOUD - lots of televisions and pop music blaring - so you have to raise your voice to talk. The waitstaff's uniforms are amusing: extremely short, body-hugging white shorts, a striped sleeveless top, white knee-high boots and a beret, if I remember correctly. Kind of like the \"Austin Powers\" kitsch meets Vegas stripper.  Update: Ate here again, and learned something. Do not order the cappuccino. It will taste artificial, and will look as if it came out of one of those self-serve machines. A rip-off.",

Service was just okay. Not spectacular so that part I would give 3 stars to. What gets the 4 stars here was the food. Mainly what I ordered...  They have lamb burgers. I LOVE domestic lamb. In fact, growing up, we ate more lamb than beef, so when I see it on a menu, I tend to go that direction. The man had a turkey burger with Swiss which he enjoyed, but we both agreed my burger rocked our mouths. I ordered it Mediterranean style with a freshly baked onion roll. What this consisted of was a perfectly medium cooked lamb patty, feta cheese, kalamata olives and about 1/8 of an avocado. OMG, so delicious, I wanted to eat another one of these today (with the Le Crap place, I should have)! The fries were decent-they offered them in 3 varieties of string, steak or waffled, but we really only ate a couple of them as our burgers were so filling.   What a great place! Highly recommended!",

Now THAT'S a happy hour!  Ordered pomme frites and kobe burgers.  For the beef lovers, WOW the kobe burgers were awesome!  (Yep, a $20 burger!  eat that carl's jr!)  Order the kobe medium rare with brie and you'll have yourself a good time!  We experienced great service!  The bar area seemed cool, large screen for sports and smaller flat panels for other sports.  And to top off the night, at last call at the bar, they threw our order of 10 long islands into to-go cups!",

But that wasn't the problem... If a restaurant has \"burger\" in the title, their burgers better be good.  The bread was overdone.  The meat was dry and not much flavor.  We got the bleu cheese burger, and the bleu cheese tasted like that nasty Athenos brand from the plastic container.    A plus is that it is a sports bar... so come get a beer and a snack of french fries... then go somewhere else for dinner!    *see my review for Stripburger!*",

We would have exchanged them for something but never could we even flag down our server. We finished eating with totally empty glasses through most of our meal. Then we sat and waited for a check. We flagged down several people asking if they could send our server over with a check but still sat until we almost walked out. Alex finally swooped by and dropped the check.

But if you are looking for more of a gourmet burger-chicken, lamb, salmon, veggie-then this could be the place for you.  Considering that it is in Vegas and the quality of the ingredients, the prices are reasonable, with most of the burgers costing around $10.  Now, they don't come with fries but for $8, we got the sampler of fries that could have fed 20 people.    They also have a 100 oz beer that is brought to the table in a large tube, which makes for quite a picture.  The service is good and the food came out relatively quickly.  I did think that my lamb burger was a bit undercooked and I was not overly impressed with the potato skins but I would certainly check it out if you are looking for some good food without spending a ton.",

    "text": "When chef Hubert Keller opened Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay in 2004, it was a bit of a gamble. How would people react to a gourmet (read: expensive) hamburger restaurant? The answer: with gusto.  Never a town shy about imitation, upscale hamburger joints are multiplying. One of the newbies is Le Burger Brasserie, which professes to be \"a French interpretation of an American classic.\"  **The Menu There are in fact choices other than hamburgers, but I barely noticed them. The emphasis is on burgers. Like Burger Bar, Le Burger Brasserie gives you a choice of basic styles (beef, lamb, vegetarian), and you specify what kind of bun and what toppings you want. The French influence seems to be limited to the copious use of \"Le\" in names.  **The Atmosphere Pretty typical sports bar. Lots of televisions, fairly informal. Service was friendly and efficient.  **The Meal I ordered Le Classique (a standard beef hamburger) on a sesame seed bun, with Swiss cheese, pancetta and a fried egg.  To accompany the burger: waffle fries, and a bottomless glass of Pepsi.  The hamburger, ordered medium, was seriously overcooked, with no pink visible and not much juice. However, its flavor was just fine. The fried egg was OK, the pancetta was very good, and the Swiss cheese was...well...Swiss cheese. Overall, this paean to cholesterol was a pretty good hamburger - better than fast food versions, but in no way a gourmet burger.  The waffle fries were crisp, but large enough to still allow for some soft insides. I would have rated them highly, but they didn't have much flavor. They were a lot like the hamburger: pretty good, but not gourmet.  **Summary If you're in the mood for a decent hamburger, are nearby, and are willing to pay a premium over fast food joints, then stop in. However, given the so-so quality, I'd be inclined to try one of its competitors, in the hope it was better. If you want a great burger, go somewhere else (e.g., the bar at Bradley Ogden).  **The Bill I neglected to write down the price.  My vague memory is that the burger was about $10, and the waffle fries were $3. To this, add drink, tax and tip.",

They were also serving $1 drafts of Blue Moon and Stella for happy hour - not a bad deal at all. Sure, the pricing on the burgers is a little high, especially since they come a la carte. But the burger was big enough that I was stuffed after eating it - no need for fries or any other kind of side item.  Overall I was very pleased with this place. I know they run a lot of good drink specials to bring folks in since they're located in an awkward place between Bally's and Paris. Check them out! But sit at the bar.",

    "text": "The irony of my visit here was that I meant to eat at one of the French (or more like French \"inspired\") restaurants here in Paris and instead decided to opt out of my crepe craving and do it American style and bastardize it by having a burger at a pseudo French burger spot.   I don't want to waste your time with me droning on about the ambiance, swanky red and black interior, bar in the middle, dim lighting and several LCD tvs around the area. The sexy (some) servers in their skimpy red corsets and black boy shorts.  A girlfriend and I choose the following: In True American fashion, I ordered the Le Paris burger-medium. Brie, smoked bacon, and caramelized onion on the oven dried tomato bun.  She had the NY strip steak (medium) with waffle cut French fries.   They have 3 types of french fries: Thin (petit) Steak cut (pomme) Waffle  Most joints usually include fries with your burger, I'm surprised to find out that's not the case here. I thought maybe I could just have some of hers, but last minute to get my own thin cut fries.  The server goofed on the order and got me the waffle fries too. I didn't care too much to correct her and I'm glad I didn't cause they were yumm-o! Nicely salted, and felt like I was snacking on chips.   The burger was delicious. I forgot there were any onions because they were nicely caramelized blended well with the smoked bacon. The tomato bun was a nice touch to it., and a side of a pickle. I wish there were more brie...  The steak was good too. I like to ruin my steak with A1, and I enjoyed this without it.   All in all, a nice place to go if you're craving a good burger. Definitey coming here again. Wish I had the extra $777 to blow on the infamous 777 Burger.  To note: I'm not a huge burger fan, and for some odd reason I was craving one that day. I still day dream about the burger I had there.",

This is a casual dining, sports grille kind of place. Both my wife and I had their $17 Burger (we selected chicken burger) and Brew combo with an order of $6 onion rings. Portion size was adequate for dinner. Waiter was attentive even though he was busy he was playful in nature. While we were eating my wife asked me if I thought the chicken burger patty was made fresh or frozen, so we asked. Our waiter with a smile said frozen but followed with the fact that they just hired a new chief and the new chief was appalled at the use of pre-made frozen chicken burgers and assured us fresh chicken burgers will be used in the future. We didn't ask but I highly suspect the onion rings were frozen as well. Somewhat surprising for a place that offers a $777 Kobe Beef and Maine Lobster Burger. Overall, I would not hesitate one bit to buy another Groupon and come back.

The menu was your standard bar menu. We ordered burgers and chicken fingers. The burger was delicious, exactly what I was looking for. I did not try the chicken finger but I heard they were delicious. We also got the skinny fries, just the way I like them... super crispy.   The server was very bubbly and personable. The food and drinks were brought to us at a normal rate.   I'd recommend eating here if you're looking for some greasy food to cure your hangover. They even offer a discount for total rewards card holders. I'd definitely return!",

It is called a sports grill due to all of the tv's with sports playing but I only saw one huge tv screen and a bunch of smaller screens all around. My eyes aren't the best but I had such a hard time seeing the screens of those smaller tv's.  It is definitely a nice place and was relatively busy when we got there but we were seated right away.  So, the burgers, they have plenty to choose from with toppings galore. I just had a standard burger because that was what I was craving. It was cooked perfect, so juicy and delish!  Hubby had the salmon burger and omg was it good. Now, the waffles fries, seriously the best fries I have ever eaten. They were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, crispy, but not too crispy and I could have seriously ate those as a meal. We also got chocolate shakes(yep we strapped on the feed bag last night) and they were pretty good but not outstanding. I would definitely go back and get the fries alone, yum!  Service was good, there but not too in your face leave me alone already type service. Plus side, military discount! A++",

Her food was cold and my No Bone rib burger had cold crispy onions.

Then my sil suggested we eat at Le Burger Brasserie; again, eye rolls. And she already had eaten there once that week. But I'm game.  I'm so glad I listened to her. My medium-well L'Italian was deliciously juicy. And the mozzarella was generously thick. The arugula was so green and fresh, and the server even let me sub out the proscuitto for a fried egg, for free!  The sil had Le Paris, that comes with Brie, onions and bacon. I didn't try it, but she clearly enjoyed it.   They have 3 types of frites -- regular, steak and waffle. We went with the steak fries, which are generously salted, but oh so tender.  Definitely the best burgers I ever had. I'll never order another burger from other restaurants again.  *Photos shot",

The new menu has set burgers no subbing allowed price @ 14 so if you need any changes you are forced to use the build your own @ 16 and you are give one cheese, 2 toppings (lettuce, tomatoe, etc) and one spread.  The food- I enjoyed the short rib fries,  but since they add meat and cheese a bowl would be more effective than the cone they use. They should also use shredded cheese as opposed to the big chunks they used. The burgers were good despite being nickeled and dimed. The bacon however is awful, thin and extremely crispy. The  husband says better than Gordon Ramsey's I can't compare. We also did see a few nats so that killed any enjoyment we had of our lunch.  There is potential but clean up and be a little more lient with subbing.",

My meat eating husband said he would go for this one, next time, even though he thoroughly enjoyed his traditional beef burger!  Deeeelish!  SKINNY FRIES - Fab!  Crunchy on the outside, deelish on the inside!  One order feeds 2-3.  ONION RINGS - Nice tower of rings.  Start with the biggest, juiciest ones 'cause you can't eat 'em all!  One order feeds 2-3.  BEER - Our waitress recommended the pale ale from Bend, OR and it was awesome!  SERVICE - Although a lot of reviewers complained about their service, we had nothing but a great server!  Timely, smiley, attentive, and happy!    PRICE - A GREAT price, especially for a place on the strip inside a nice cool casino with ambiance galor.  (between Bally's and Paris)  BUNS - OMG, I almost forgot the buns!  All of their burger buns are freshly made by them every day.  Holy cow!  Melt in your mouth goodness.    WAIT TIME - NONE!  7:00pm on a Saturday night, no less!  Woohoo!!  We are out of towners and rarely go to Vegas, but when we're back there next we will definitely seek this place out.",

Due to the strong alcohol flavor the diet taste wasn't as strong.  I will not drink diet soda due to the poisonous effects on people's bodies. I did not order diet.  When we discussed with the manager, he took off the only one drink, but would not take off the other drink that included the diet soda.  The Bill clearly stated at the beginning but I ordered regular Pepsi and somehow they changed it to diet.  Make sure that you know what you're ordering or they can take advantage.  My friend also ordered Grey Goose and two times received the wrong drink.  I am very disappointed with their Hurt to make things right.

I had a chocolate nutella shake prior to this visit and it was amazing, this time around I had it again (minus the alcohol) and it wasn't anything special.

On top of that, the dessert sliders are really something else! The dessert sliders are shaped like the name, little burger like dessert treats that are sweet and addicting. I would recommend for anyone who does eat here, order the dessert sliders at least once for the experience!  Happy hour is also a great deal at this location, reasonable and a good assortment of drinks to choose from.

I've been here before and I enjoyed the food here - but this place did a full 180 during my most recent visit.  1. The food was COLD. The place wasn't really that busy, being that it was 10:00pm, but our waitress seemed to be so frazzled the whole night. It took a while for us to order and receive our food. My boyfriend ordered the kobe burger and I decided on the lamb burger, in addition to an onion ring tower. When the food finally arrived, with the onion ring appetizer arriving after the burgers, we found out that everything was room temperature or cold. However, I was so hungry that I decided to ignore it.  2. FOREIGN OBJECTS in the burger. Halfway through my burger, I bit something hard. It turns out that it was a hardened piece of PLASTIC from the patty casing. I immediately reported this to the waitress and she apologized and went to the back to talk to the chef. She same back and asked if I wanted a new burger, which of course I said yes (I was still hungry!). 5 min later, she delivered a fresh HOT lamb burger and it was very tasty. The burger was comp'd from the check.  I think the only good thing that I experienced during my last visit here is that they make a delicious frozen raspberry mojito. Cheers!",

The only thing I didn't like about the restaurant is that it is basically an upscale sports bar. It was a Sunday and there were a few people watching the football games that were being shown on the TVs but it might as well have been a group of 40 people since these guys were screaming and thrashing around.  I recommend this place because the food was good and it was fun. But if you're not expecting to see sports being shown and people being loud, then you're in for a surprise and might not like it.",

The waitresses wear can-can type outfits but didn't look so bad that it makes you lose your appetite.   I had the Coupe - chopped salad. It was good. Others at the table had salads and didn't enjoy them as much, mainly the grilled chicken salad. According to the waitress that the chefs make the candied walnuts every day and each has a different recipe. We much have been there with the 'off' chef since it was some random pecans scattered - not even walnuts - and they weren't candied. Others enjoyed their burgers. The tower of onion rings was very good and very plentiful - enough for multiple people.   Service overall was good.  I think because each waitress only had a few tables so it was easier to continually get drink refills.  Saturdays at 8pm starts Happy Hour with $3 domestics and $5 wells.",

There was a great selection of patty meat (salmon, lamb, beef, kobe beef, etc) and buns (oven roasted tomato, caramelized onion, etc), but I think that's expected from a burger they charge more than $10 each.  I got the Saveur medium rare, which is a lamb burger, with fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, the usual fixings, and oven roasted tomato bun. It was delicious and just as expected, but I could not finish the burger because the lamb flavor became very strong. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the burger, but it just simply did not blow me out of the water.  We also got the french fry platter to share. Also very standard, nothing special, and if anything, a little bit too salty than the average french fry. All in all, not a place I would crave to come back but wouldn't mind to pop in for a bite or if I'm in the mood for something more than the standard American burger.",

On top of that Nicolette gave us a free desert because of the burger and the wait.  My burger was great and with service like this who wouldn't come back!",

They have specialty burgers that are sorted by \"country,\" which mostly meant there was some type of special cheese/ingredient that classified it that way.  Anyways, the burgers were juicy and very satisfying, and not that overpriced considering this is Vegas.  The drinks, on the other hand, were very expensive but quite good, including 1 watermelon flavored martini that I don't remember the name of.  If you stay at Harrah's or any of their hotels, they usually give you a coupon here, which is why we came.  Glad we did!",

The burger seemed small at first, which worried me because I was very hungry, but as I ate it I realized that it was deceptive. It was quite filling, but in a good way. The fries are separate, so we ordered waffle fries to share and I really enjoyed those.  My only reason for knocking it a half star was being charged $4.00 extra for red bull. I realize vodka red-bull is usually expensive, but I paid an average of $10-13 in Vegas and was fine with that. But when you tack on $4.00 but didn't indicate that anywhere on your menu, or did not inform me verbally... that's kind of a downer. I would have ordered something else to drink.  But overall it's a pretty decent place to eat when you're hungry.",

Very disappointing lack of tap beer for a purported sports bar.  Wouldn't go here again when there are so many other choices on the Strip.

How strange, though, that the streets of the City of Light were clogged with one-armed bandits and semi-nude girls in tiny can-can outfits. And how oddly chunky and un-chic the Frenchies were getting!  Oh wait.  Righty-ho.  We were, in fact, still in the U.S. , albeit  in the Vegas zone. Still dazed from our flight, the traumatic car-rental Borg Palace at McCarran, and from getting an unexpected  upgrade to a suite 1/8 the size of Nevada at Harrah's (for 70 bucks!!!  marble clad Jacuzzi the size of my bathroom! a wet bar! view of the Strip!  disco balls!! whoo-weeee!), we were totally looking for a calorie-fest to celebrate the beginning of our driving trip around the Southwest. and we'd read some good recommendations for Le Burger Brasserie.   Plus we're both Pariso-philes, and we were hungry, so the deed was done.  They don't make it easy to find, whomever the Dark Forces of Casino Restaurant Planning are, but eventually we found ourselves to the slick yet bland-ly sports bar-ish brasserie.  Now, this place resembled a Paris brasserie about as much as Spongebob Squarepants resembles Pepe Le Pew, but it was okay. It's a large, multi-level space, but apparently not large enough to house a restroom.  For that, you had to wander into Bally's casino and mix with the weeping lady with the Farrah-cut and the embroidered jeans. Ah, the million tender heartbreaks of Vegas.  Food?  I had the Frenchieburger, or whatever they call their burger with Brie and carmelized onions. I asked for it rare and it came medium.  Given that flagrant disregard for my bloodlust, the damn thing was pretty good.  And the fries...well they were supah-dupah.  It must have been the double frying they got...My thighs expanded just taking that first sniff, but they'd been dipped in rosemary and possibly fried in lard, so who was I to argue? Heeeaaaaaveeeeennnn!  S, who was still not quite as wicked as he was gonna be, got a turkeyburger. I say no more. He enjoyed it and claimed it was juicy and tasty.  I thoght he was gonna go all manorexic on me and disdain the fries, but after the first few he too started making those embarassing primal sounds and we just stopped talking for awhile.   It was Cinco de Mayo and they had $3.00 Coronas, which in Vegas seems to signify a bargain.  Clearly, they've never been to Pittsburgh (the bucket-o-scotch special at Dell's? $1.25).  I disdained the South of the Border Lizard Pee and got a nice stout Black n'Tan to wash down what i was hoping would be a nice bloody patty.  Be that as it may, our meal was  just fine and not as exorbitant as many of the gotcha! casino eateries.  In fact we passed on the mundane dessert offers (the usual brownies and crappy cheesecake offerings) and waddled off to work of 1 fry's worth of calories in the sweltering and ca-ray-zee Vegas night.",

This is basically just a sports bar that serves burgers with French names so they can charge more.  I did like their selection of burgers (salmon, chicken, veggie, turkey and beef).  Both my wife and I ordered the \"Le Paris\" burger that had brie, smoked bacon and caramelized onions.  I ordered the beef burger and she ordered the chicken one.  We also ordered the fry sampler with waffle and petite fries.  The burgers were pretty tasty and a good size.  My only complaint was that the meat was VERY VERY salty.  Both the beef and chicken were seasoned with something with tons of salt.  The waffle fries were ok but the other ones were just 'eh.  They needed some kind of aioli.  Our waitress was fast and friendly and the bill was not too unreasonable because it is over-priced Vegas after all.  With tons of other burger joints in Vegas I probably will not return to this one.",

The focus is clearly on burgers, but besides the beef and turkey staples, they also have ground salmon and ground chicken, which is unique.  It's build-your-own, in the tradition of the Counter, except for some pre-designed selections.  The burgers are fry-less, so order a side if you want them.    I had ground chicken with brie, grilled shallots, and bacon, and my Dining Buddy had...something unexciting (beef with cheese and bacon or mushrooms or something).  We each really enjoyed our burgers, once we were able to figure out how to eat them.  The fresh lettuce and tomatoes stack the burger up so tall, it's difficult to wrap your mind - or your mouth - around it.  $40 for two people (two snazzy burgers and a double side of fries), which for Vegas and for a high-quality burger, isn't bad at all.  The service was very good for us, though I could see that it might wildly vary.",

We waited to be seated for about 15 minutes which was OK except for the fact that there were several empty tables.  They're just understaffed enough they can't clear all the tables to accommodate the arriving guests.  Our server, Leo, was a personable young man and answered questions we had.  He's the reason this isn't the two star rating I'd normally give for the food.  Le Burger Brasserie--good burgers and such.  No, not really.  They're burgers made from frozen patties.  They are so uniform in diameter and thickness they have to be packaged ahead of time.  I asked for mine rare but it was more toward medium rare.  My wife asked for hers medium and hers was cooked the same as mine.  The burgers were not at all juicy.  They look pretty, so to speak, because they come in their paper-lined metal basket with the side of lettuce and tomato.  I got a bleu burger and my wife got the Le Paris, a burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, bacon.  My burger had bleu cheese and bacon with a half avocado on the side.  You also get to choose from among 4 or 5 options for the kind of bun you want for the burger.  When I leave a burger place and the things that stick in my head about the meal are the avocado and the bleu cheese, then it wasn't a great burger experience.    For dessert, we shared the beignets, 5 small rounds filled with mascarpone and served with chocolate dipping sauce and whipped cream.  They were OK, but nothing I'll remember.  Spending an hour and a half having a burger is also too long.  It turned out to be alright because I was watching the college football game on their big screen.  We got out in just enough time to walk to the Jubilee! Theatre for our show and we had some time to spare.    I'd recommend going anywhere else for a burger.  I know these are Strip prices but give me something a little more worthy of the price you're charging.",

There was nothing crispy about it but there was indeed a very strong salmon taste. We also got the onion rings which looked great. They were pretty good but the sauce they came with was without flavor. Considering the prices the meal should have been MUCH better!  I doubt I will return.",

This place was a great venue to do so.     We had no wait.  The server was very pleasant.  I followed some of the reviews and ordered Le Paris Burger cooked medium with waffle fries.  My burger was very juicy but on the bland side.  I recommend a good seasoning before the first bite.  I am addicted to the waffle fries.  I should have special ordered a topping or sauce (besides Ketchup).  Atmosphere was great.  Overall a great experience if you need a quick meal.   Like everywhere in Vegas ... it was on the expensive side.   My burger and waffle fries and ice tea was $25.   There are cheaper eats.",

It's like the bonus fry in the mcdonalds bag you miss which is rare. Booths were pretty comfortable. Nice leather feel and cushion with just enough support. Nice felt backing to the booths too. Only complaint was I used a half empty squeeze bottle of ketchup and ruined my plate and entire surrounding area almost destroying the great meal. Another plus was sports on the TV. Oh wait another complaint was the ac was cranking and basically slowly froze to death while somehow enjoying a burger. All in all a good place",

The burgers have been cooked to perfection every single time, and the service has been excellent alongside the food.  While the build your own burgers are without a doubt the star of the show, there is very little on the menu that dissapoints. The cheeseburger mac and cheese bites are delicious, the buffalo chicken dip is savory and rich, and the shakes are creamy with a satisfying edge.  In all my years of coming to Vegas, there is a lot that is overpriced. This place, however, is not one of them. You get what you pay for and then some. If you like burgers and are passing through Vegas and enjoy burgers in any form, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. Go get some!",

Our table also shared an Eiffel tower of beer, that I really wish I would have taken a picture of.

The menu I seen had sweet potato fries on it and a kobe beef, fries and a shake for $27 with your choice of bun. Sounded great to all of us so off we went with our Groupon. Well the menu had changed- No more $27 special, No choice of bun, and No sweet potato fries. So we settled for 3 of the kobe burgers, waffle fries and 1 of us got a chocolate shake. Skip the overpriced small shake. Waffle fries were very good but a little too thick. After my second bite I found my burger had a hair in it,  so I had to wait for them to make me another one. The 2nd burger was great with carmelized onions and mushrooms. My bun was nicely toasted while my other 2 guests buns were burnt. I only ate 1/2 my burger-kinda lost my appetite after the hair. We asked the busboy for a to go box and he said he would get us one, but never came back.  Glad we had a groupon because paying $21 for a kobe burger is not worth it.  They did comp my \"hair\" burger, but the manager never came over to personally apologize, whuch I would have expected.",

But I saw one go by and I said, screw it. The only problem was the waitress. She really seemed as though some one pissed on her cheerio's. I got that vibe as soon as I sat down. There were four of us and it just didn't get any better. No refills on my iced tea. No asking how the dinner was and no dessert. The burger was great though.  The second night didn't get any better. We were waiting for a table in the court by the fountain. As I was laying on the fountain taking a picture of the stained glass ceiling. One of the ladies came and got me. She was in a worse mood than the last one we had. (Unless she was the same one?) She passed me off to a server, making a comment to each other and then laughing. I know that I was in for another ride. Our server was a guy, and he seemed very pleasent. I got another italian and a coupe salad. They were both very good. Then he asked what we wanted for dessert. That is why I came back. I wanted that cheese cake. My friend said cheesecake and before he got cheese out of his mouth. He turned around and grabbed a plate off of the table next to me and bolted for the kitchen? I thought that someone called him and that he would be back to take my order. Nope! 5 minutes later he dropped off my friends plate and took off again. Of course this if funny to everyone else. I sat there fumming. He came back to collect the plate and I asked him why he didn't ask me what I wanted? He said that I didn't want anything. What The F*%#@. I didn't have time to say anything. He asked if I wanted it now. I replied by saying. Why, so my friend can watch me eat, like I did to him. He just walked away. I still gave him 15%. But I will tell everyone I know what a crap hole this place is. Thanks for ruining my last night in Vegas.",

We were served by a great waitress (forgot her name but she has a tattoo across her chest) she was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly.  We ordered a panzella salad and pretzel appetizer.  The salad was big and very good - a perfect blend - and the dressing was delicious.  The pretzels were 2 hard sticks and 4 soft very large nuggets with 2 dipping sauces, one was a spicy mustard and a very good cheese dip.  My husband ordered the BBQ chicken burger and I built my burger.  He felt the burger was plain as are most chicken burgers but not bad at all.  My burger was a beef burger with mozzarella, sundried tomatoes,  lettuce, and garlic aioli which was delicious...it really hit the spot.   I gave it 5 stars because the service was great, food was great, and I prefer a smaller menu (the online menu is not their current menu).  It was a sports bar so you we were able to watch the basketball playoffs as well. I would recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "For years now, I have been a dedicated fan of Burger Bar over at Luxor/Mandalay Bay.  That was the only place I would do burgers in Vegas because they were just so good.  Every time I mentioned Burger Bar though, someone would always ask \"Have you been to the burger place at the Paris casino before, it's just as good\".   Well, on my most recent trip to Vegas last month, I finally tried that \"burger place at Paris\".  It's called Le Burger Brasserie and it is very good!  My wife and I stopped in and first noticed that they had a good \"bucket of beer\" special that consisted of 5 or 6 of the larger aluminum beer bottles in a bucket of ice for a decent price.  We naturally started off with that and then ordered our food.  I ordered the Kobe beef burger and my wife went for the turkey burger.  Similar to Burger Bar, they have many different toppings for the burgers (although I don't think they have quite as many options as Burger Bar).  I went with mushrooms and bacon on my Kobe burger.  We also ordered two different kinds of fries, skinny fries and waffle cut fries.  The food came out quickly and we dug right in.  My Kobe burger was wonderful.  My wife's turkey burger was very good too, but I think Burger Bar has a slight edge in the turkey burger category.  The fries though....these were the best fries I have ever had.  Amazingly good!  They had some type of seasoning on them that faintly reminded me of those Hot Fries snacks you find in the chip aisle at the store.  What a great taste.  We ate every last crumb of the fries.  Overall, we had a fun time and a great casual meal here.  Very good burgers and fries.  As far as the competition goes between Le Burger Brasserie and Burger Bar, I still prefer Burger Bar, but this place is close behind them.",

If you like variety, then this is a place to fill up your tank with fried brick-in-your-stomach food.  We got the \"Frites\" Sampler and Eiffel Tower Onion Rings.  Both soaked with lovely oil and flavor.  I had the classic burger with pesto sauce and it was a great first experience putting pesto on my burger.  A friend of mine got the vegetarian burger and even that looked really appetizing... like some giant omelette burger.  Service was friendly and I'd definitely hit this place up again.  The only thing disappointing for me was that the name of the place didn't hold up to its end of the bargain............",

You get fat burgers, serviced by hotties in short shorts and red corsets. yes, the women are the same body shape as the ladies from Hooters, but after all the eye candy, how is the food? Food is so good, it makes you forget about all the hot women for a minute. The Paris burger is good, with onion, brie all smothered over bacon. Good lord, my arteries were begging for mercy like Tom Arnold on his honeymoon night with Roseanne Barr. The drinks were good and stiff too. Wife had the lamb burger, and it was good. Guys..if you come here with your woman, wear some sunglasses so she wont catch you checking out the hotties, or else your balls might be on the menu as well.",

I had a chicken burger with brie, smoked bacon, and shallots, while my friend had the \"le classique\" beef burger with brie and some other toppings that have slipped my mind. All burgers come served with lettuce, tomato, red onion, a pickle, and your choice of house-baked bun. We also ordered a french fry sampler of skinny and waffle fries. The fries were outstanding--perfectly crispy and seasoned, with no greasy residue. The mistake we made was that we ordered a sampler, when one order of fries is more than enough to feed two people with average appetites. Our server was Nicoletta and she was very friendly and provided excellent service. The price was reasonable, and they have great Happy Hour specials. Would we go here again? There's a slim possibility, but there are so many great burger joints in Las Vegas, this would be on the bottom of our list. In the future, come here for the Happy Hour specials and the french fries. They also have lots of flatscreens, so this would be a good option for those who want to watch the game over a beer.",

    "text": "This night we were on our way to go see Jubilee, so went early and walked around to decide where to eat.  We choose Le Burger - won't be back.  It was happy hour, but our waitress sat us \"on the carpet\", so not available for happy hour unless we moved.  I could see if she had said only the bar was HH, but the tile floor tables also qualified.  We ordered two Sharps non alcoholic beers and after several minutes, our server returned to our table and said it our drinks would arrive in a few minutes!  what?  My husband asked about the delay and she said they were in the back, so then he wanted to make sure they would be cold and she said they would be super cold, cuz they had been in the back.  We FINALLY get our drinks, and maybe they were cold, but  the mugs were not, so not cold after pouring.....of course, then our food came, which was disappointing only in that we like to enjoy our drink before dinner, not with it.  My husband got the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich and he said it was one of the best \"burgers\" he had ever had.  I got the Shrimp app and the 5 shrimp were big, but back off on the amount of frying time!!  I like my stuff crispy, but these were really overdone and the flavor of the shrimp was gone.  Usually, I order fries to be well done or xrta crispy, but said nothing and thankfully so.  The fries were over done and had that batter stuff on them, which I hate, so the shrimp and the fries tasted the same - like nothing!  I only ate the shrimp, after adding hot sauce to the remoulade that came with them.  It would have been nice to have cocktail sauce, which I thought was in the dish (not ketchup, since that was on the table), but we did not really see our server again til the end.  The restaurant was not busy and there was plenty of staff - which always results in less attentive service.  The bartenders looked like they were having fun at the bar, throwing the bottles around and all that - I wish we would have sat there - it would have been more entertaining.",

I had the l'americain burger that comes with a half pound black angus beef patty,American cheese, 3 huge onion rings and mushrooms( I got the burger without mushrooms) you have an option for additional toppings at a fee. I added bacon and a fried egg to my burger. You also have a choice of bun. From sesame seed,wheat and a Parmesan. I took the Parmesan bun and requested a little mayo as the burger does not come with mayo. Man the thing was so big when I tried to take a bite out of it my jaw hurt from trying to take a bite.So I had to kinda press it down more so it wasn't so big. I took the first bite and thought I was in heaven,literally. It was so delicious. Alot of flavor and a very juicy. Not to mention it's generous amount. For a side we got waffle fries and steak fries. Not the best but still very good ! My review is solely based on this burger and it's nice atmosphere. I haven't tried anything else on the menu. All I know is that I will definitely be back for the l'americain just like I had it today on future visits to Vegas !",

At first I thought it was some fancy French restaurant but after seeing the girls in their tight brassieres and big screen TVs I was sold. I came to realize this place is basically a burger joint. Most of the menu consists of burgers and the type of foods you eat while watching a sports game. One thing that makes this place different is that they have all types of burgers. Beef, chicken, turkey, veggie, salmon, and lamb. Pretty good variety of meats and a lot of sides to choose from too. I never had a lamb burger before and thought I'd give it a shot. It was very delicious. Moist, tender, and full of flavor. I also liked that it wasn't a messy burger like many are and the skinny fries are amazing! Service was great and prices are very reasonable. Definitely a place I'd go to again.",

As we walked between Bally's and Paris we came across Le Burger Brasserie.  It was about 3:30pm or so.  We checked the menu and liked what we saw.  We approached the hostess were seated immediately.  There were plenty of tables available.  The waitress came and took our drink order and returned quickly.  We placed our order and within 10-15 minutes we had our food.  I had a burger with Swiss cheese and it was fantastic. My wife had the sliders and they were equally delicious.  We were especially impressed with the fact that both orders were cooked perfectly to our order.  We shared an order of fries and they too were delicious.  Overall a great experience - delicious food, great service, pleasant atmosphere and reasonable (for Vegas Strip Casino restaurants).  I don't know what it would be like during an extremely busy time, but during our off-peak visit it was fabulous.",

We opted to eat at the bar after walking in past the empty podium.  We asked if we could sit anywhere and were told to check in at the podium.  We went back out to the podium and there was now a line and someone taking names.  Perfect.  So we opted for the bar.  We were served by the bartender and occasionally one of the waitresses.  The bartenders wore long pants and button-up short sleeve shirts.  The waitresses wore a belt that looked like shorts and a revealing top with push up bras.  The bartender was not hot.  The waitresses were.  We were sitting next to a couple chowdah heads from Massachusetts.  They had lame swagger and were throwing attitude at the bartender which he was tossing right back.  One of them tried to hit on the waitress, offering up his room number.  She scrawled a quick \"0\" on a napkin and handed it to him, replying that his number was zero.  I had sliders which were ok, nothing special.  The company and staff were amusing in a very Vegas sort of way.",

    "text": "Three stars A-OK.  Extra half-star because good food at decent prices can be hard to find on the Strip.  Extra half-star because they have a long-term Groupon available for half-price, so it came out to a good price for a lot of food.  Things we liked:  The \"grilles\" portobello/peppers/onions/spinach burger (vegetarian) was __amazing__.  The sweet potato fries were standard but good.  I've definitely had much worse.  One of us got a real beef burger, I don't remember which, but she loved it.  The booths are comfortable and the dark wood look is very nice.  The tiramisu was EXCELLENT.  Nicolette was a super guide - friendly, knowledgeable about the options, warm and patient, even though she had way too many tables to handle, and couldn't be around all the time.  Which leads me to things we liked less:  She did have too many tables, we thought.  At these prices, she must be making a fortune, and I support that because she really seemed to care about serving everyone well.  But it did take a while sometimes, and my coffee was cold and then empty before she came by.  I had to ask her for a refill of it.  They don't have any soy or almond milk for coffee.  That stuff keeps longer than regular milk; I wish they'd think to offer it.  I feel like they can't decide whether they're a sports bar or something a little quieter and classier, more like good ol' Hamburger Hamlet (if you know them).  I found being surrounded by TVs seemed a bit distracting, though I really appreciated that the sound was more or less off.  Aside from the TVs, which were out of the way up high on the wall, it was very nice.  The \"le legumes\" burger is a few steps above Morningstar.  The toppings made it very tasty, but the patty is kind of an afterthought.  The espresso shake was really light on the espresso.  It looked so good on the menu!  The paper the burgers were served on seems less pretty than the rest of the theme.  Everything else is in dark rich colors but the paper was borrowed from Johnny Rocket's.  I daresay people will love their food more if they step up the paper.  One of our burgers came with no top bun. (?)  Happily, the recipient was planning on skipping the top bun anyway.  If there are psychics in the kitchen, this should go under \"things we liked\", I suppose.  We never asked for the bun; perhaps the kitchen is still wondering where the extra top bun came from.  The prices are strange, as others have pointed out here.  The main bits are Vegassy medium priced, but all the extras add up and despite our groupon, we ended up spending more than we expected.  On the other hand, the excellent tiramisu was only $5.  That said, if you can get the Groupon, by all means go.  I wish I had another one of those portobello burgers right now.",

    "text": "Located in the mall between Paris & Ballys, just right outside the casino entrance to Ballys.   \"BEST BURGERS IN VEGAS - BURGER BRASSERIE \"  um....not even close.   I think it's supposed to be a restaurant. Or is it a sports bar?  I've still not decided. Decor is lovely, comfortable actually.  Spacious.  Very spacious. Variety of sized tables to meet varying groups of patrons.  Bar itself is large, TVs tuned to every sports network possible.  Compared to the atmosphere the menu is a bit confusing.  Build your own burger, gourmet burgers, sliders, gravy fries, Almond Joy cheesecake and pretzels are a few items on the menu, to include a $777 burger. It does come with a bottle of Dom however....  I came here during the week for dinner.  Lots of empty tables; servers standing around twiddling thumbs, watching tv, talking amongst themselves. Took forever for our bright purple haired server to take our drink order.  There must have been a drought as our water took an eternity to arrive.  We had questions about the menu and were told not only was the menu new, but the food was better because everything was freshly made as opposed to their last menu where everything was frozen.  I opted to build my own burger, nothing fancy.  Requested it be cooked medium well & an hour later it came out rare.  My server argued with me.  Back it went and an hour later my replacement showed up.  Unfortunately it wasn't the burger I built; it was supposed to come with fried onion straws/slivers but instead someone put chopped red onion on it.  Not that it really mattered bc by the time it arrived I was no longer hungry as I filled up on my ok fries during my wait. I had it boxed up & ate part of it for dinner the next night...  I arrived here at 6:30pm & did not leave until after 10pm.  This is how S L O W they were.  Purple haired server rarely checked on us.  We went to the bar to have the bartender replenish our water & beers.  As I mentioned, numerous staff doing nothing; it was THE MANAGER you saw working, busing tables, delivering plates, setting tables & the like.  We did discuss our experience with him & while he did not comp any portion of our bill, he did give us his business card with \"2 free entrees next visit\" written on the back. We asked if he would have our server bring our check. 30 minutes later it arrived. It took just over an hour to pay it. Unacceptable.  Needless to say we tore up our \"2 free entree\" pass.  Overall the food was just average. Certainly not good enough to advertise themselves as having the Best Burgers in Vegas. The service was miserable.  I wished we stayed home. Cheers to your visit being better than mine (I hope)!",

    "text": "There are hundreds of places to eat in Vegas. We decided on this place as it was the closest gourmet burger place to our hotel located in Bally's.  It's basically a sports bar with decent food. The female servers and hostesses are all wearing French bustiers and short shorts with fishnet stockings so it's possible to get your creep on and feel like a perv ogling the staff. The food is good. I had the All American turkey burger that had bacon and a fried egg on it. Yum! My pal had the onion rings that were awesome and staked on a metal stick. Prices are what you expect on the Strip $15-$18 for burgers, sides extra of course. They even feature a $777 Kobe burger with fois gras and likely comes with an Escort to hand feed it to you. Worth a try but it's probably on par with the other 600 gourmet burger joints on the Strip so don't bother if you aren't walking distance from Bally's. It was good but I'm not writing any Haiku's about it either.",

Topped with a thin slab of feta cheese that looked like rubber. Couldn't believe that a place that is supposed to be a 'burger' restaurant would serve a burger that bad! Only good item was the bun, but the bun was so large compared to the burger that it over powered the small thin burger. Was extremely disappointed in all the food ordered-Parmesan lemon wings, hot wings both were made with same base wing (over battered, prob started with same frozen wing product). Sure you can find another place that serves better burgers in Vegas as the bar was set so low here. Only convenient thing was that we were staying in the Paris Las Vegas for a convention and since we were tired from the day, the place was close (located between Paris and Bally's) not overly expensive imposed to most Vegas restaurants, but definitely NOT worth the price!",

We asked for a To Go box and she just threw it on the table, which we thought was so rude. We asked our waters to be filled 3 times before she actually got around to it. The restaurant is expensive, so I expected better service. Overall, it's worth going if you enjoy a good burger. Hopefully, you get a better waitress/waiter.",

    "text": "I'm not usually the type that goes for a $10+ burger, but I was wandering around the Strip & casinos with a friend & popped into Burger Brasserie after wandering around inside Bally's (I had no idea that we made it from Bally's into Paris).  We arrived at about 4PM & were promptly seated. After being in & out of the 110+ degree temps outside, we were in desperate need of hydration, so it was extra-annoying that our waiter approached our table a couple minutes after we were seated but then when he was a foot away, he abruptly turned around & headed back into the kitchen for something.     Two very long minutes later, he came to our table.  We were prepared to order drinks & meals, but as soon as he took our drink order, he walked off!  NOT A GREAT START, FOR A PLACE THAT CHARGES ALMOST $20 FOR A BURGER!    It was 'happy hour,' so I think my friend got the best deal -- two cocktails for the price of one, while I stuck to an iced tea.  We each ordered the caramelized onion burger ($17), but mine with the vegetarian patty, & we shared an order of fries ($7).  My burger was very good  though I think it's hard to go-wrong with cheese & caramelized onions on something. Another redeeming factor was that I was going thru my iced teas pretty quickly (I had 5 or 6 during the 75 minutes we were there) & the staff --not always our waiter-- did a great job keeping them refilled -- a lifesaver.  Not any sort of view or much ambience inside the place, so we're paying the high prices due to the location on the Strip (again,no view of anything though)  & *perception* that it's a classy! upscale place.  If I'm back on the Strip with friends looking for an upscale burger place, I'd rather try something new, but wouldn't have any major qualms going back to Burger Brasserie -- if you're going to eat on the Strip, you can't be a cheapskate.",

Unfortunately, the fries and onion rings are a frozen product ;(   The service was average, the girls are busy and working lots of tables so I get it.   The positive? My Le' Paris burger was delicious!! It had Brie cheese, carmelized onions and bacon on it, the combination of those flavors was awesome!!   I would probably go back for a quick bite without a wait.  My opinion is that this is an older Vegas restaurant that used to be poppin' and now it's lost some of that hotness that's so important in this city! I would guess that this gets a makeover into a different restaurant in the near future!   MY GO-TO: Le'Paris Burger!",

    "text": "I always pass by here when walking from Bally's to Paris, so I finally decided to try it out.   Came here during lunch, got seated right away as there wasn't many people.   My boyfriend ordered the burger with blue cheese, and I ordered the burger with grilled onions.  I don't remember the name of the burgers as I didn't take a picture of the menu.  Both burgers were recommended by our waitress.  She offered superb service, so no complaints on that.  We also ordered the onion rings.  They are huge and stacked on top of each other in a tower form.  I think in total there were 5 onion rings, dusted with cheese powder. The onion rings were hot, but didn't have any onion flavour.  Perhaps there was too much batter.   The burgers looked good and had good presentation, but it didn't taste good at all.  Not juicy and dry.  The blue cheese burger was very pungent, so I guess if you love blue cheese, you might like this burger, but it covers all the other taste.   Was really disappointed.  On the plus side because I'm a diamond member, right before we were leaving and paying, the manager came and gave us two sample sizes of vanilla milkshake for being a diamond member.   That was really good and creamy.  Come for the shakes, and nothing else.",

My dining companion was in the mood for a salad, so we went with the Caesar Salad (\"romaine, parmesan cheese, croutons\") and mentioned we'd be sharing.  A few minutes later, our waitress brought two separate Caesar Salads on two plates, so we assumed she had somehow misheard and put in two orders. I grumpily ate mine, although it was indeed an above-average Caesar. The dressing was creamy and had a nice acidic bite running through it, while the croutons were fairly flavorful.  When the bill arrived, however, I noticed we were only charged for one salad and our waitress had helpfully divided the order in two. All was forgiven, but I just wish she had mentioned what she had done to allay our considerable confusion and consternation.",

The burger itself was very well-prepared. Medium was juicy and pink all the way through, and the Gruyere and onions worked nicely on top. I didn't care for the bun options but went with wheat which was fine. A really nice combination. The waffle fries were fresh, crispy, and lightly seasoned. A single was enough for two people to share but any more than that and I would go with the double.",

Thought she was gonna greet us and seat us right away but we greeted her first. That wasn't the end of the world for us. When we sat at the booth/table, the atmosphere was very sports bar, even the menu. Kinda hard to read because the categories were worded like a scoreboard.   The food came out quick as we were pretty starving. I ordered the French Dip sandwich and my coworkers ordered their cheeseburger deal that came with fries and a beer. Her burger was kinda sad, but it was...i guess a deal since it came with beer and fries?  Overall it was alright...",

I walked by this restaurant numerous times since it is in the walkway connecting Paris and Bally's. Every time I walk by, every hostess i've seen standing outside looks very bored and looks like they hate their job. Moreover, the restaurant always look very empty.   Well, I had to use my food voucher anyways so why not give it a try even though I don't have the best first impression.   I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings.   Service: slow and rude. The restaurant was very empty when I went in the afternoon with only two servers in the entire restaurant. The server was very slow in getting our orders and she seemed like she was in a rush to move onto the next table to serve them.   Food: The burger was bland. It also doesn't come with any sides. For the price, the burger was definitely overpriced since it wasn't tasty and it didn't come with any sides. The onion rings were better than the burger but nothing over the top.   In conclusion, I would suggest staying away form this restaurant. Maybe use the food voucher somewhere else.",

We were looking for a cheaper dinner place as the buffet were too expensive for our taste.   The menu looked good as well as the prices so we walked over and were seated immediately. The server came quickly and took our drink order. We'd figured out what we wanted. And ordered a menu item French Burger, and a Make your own burger. And a side of Onion Rings.   The food came fairly quickly, and was attractively played. The burgers were extremely delicious as were the Onion rings. The beef was some of the best burger meat I've ever had in a restaurant. My wife also thought so.  The portions were large enough we couldn't finish what we'd ordered.  The server paid enough attention without hovering. With our meal, amber Ale beer for me and a milkshake for my wife the bill was $50+ . We'd have spent more elsewhere but still not what we're sure used to paying to eat dinner out. But it is Vegas!!",

TWENTY minutes later the food had not arrived.

He walked away - NEVER checked in again. The food did arrive, but NO check was delivered. I SHOULD have walked out - but - because I'm honest, I sought out the barkeep and paid her. I left NO tip - the damn manager can tip her!! He does NOT belong in the restaurant business and I have NO plans to return to this place. There is NO EXCUSE for treating a customer like this - and I will now make sure that EVERYONE knows what a horses ass the manager of this place is and how he runs it.",

This is a great location to come watch some games, have some beers and have good bar food. We ordered the blue cheese and Paris burger. You have the option to pick from different buns (onion bun, wheat and potatoes)  The patties were perfectly cooked and the quality of the ingredients was better than most. Overall, they were just a bit better than average. I personally enjoyed the blue cheese burger, but only order this if you are a True blue cheese fan as this can be a bit overwhelming. The service was just ok. Overall, not a bad choice for a laid back meal at the strip.",

I can't remember her name, but she was attentive, and gave us great suggestions and recommendations on the menu.  We ordered 2 burgers and the waffle fries, all very tasty.  While the burgers were good, they were so over powered by cheese.  Now don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but when there is more cheese spilling out of the burger and all over the plate, it's a little much.  My husband had the blue cheese burger, and I could smell the pungentness of the cheese from across the table.  The actual burger itself was good.  The waffle fries get an A++ with the spicy ketchup that they come with.",

They have a decent size menu and plenty of options if you aren't in the mood for a burger.  We started with \"hangover cure\" bloody Mary's. They were good, but definitely not the best bloody Mary I've ever had.   We share an appetizer sampler which had chicken wings, mac & cheese balls, and a few other things i can't remember. The chicken wings were great! However I was not expecting the mac & cheese balls to have meat in them. That was a little weird for me.   I ordered the burger with Valveeta on it. and oh my goodness it was tasty! Perfectly cooked Medium well and with an onion bun it was a very simple yet delicious burger.   My friends ordered a french dip and salad to share, and they liked the salad but definitely were not fans of their french dip. I was extremely greasy and the cheese sauce on it was pretty gross. After tasting it I agreed with them.   Our service here was average at best. All the servers were women in corsets and booty shorts so I don't think they hire them based on their resumes.   While we were dining, a woman at the table next to us started choking on her food. Luckily a man at the next table jumped up and sprang into action to give her the Heimlich and help her get the food out of her throat and breathe again. I know most servers aren't required to take any kind of CPR course so I wasn't shocked any of them weren't able to help. Luckily the woman was completely okay once she was able to cough up her food, but I was rather bothered by the fact that management was no where to be seen, and once he did come out he was on his cell phone calling an EMT (as I found out later) The restaurant did guy the man a round of drinks for helping the choking woman so that was awesome. But watching this all first hand the manager seemed pretty useless.",

The fries were good though so I just figured I'd eat them and move on. That was until I got the check that showed they were charging an additional $8 for the fries on top of the $15 burger that I barely ate. I said something and he just kinda brushed it off like he hadn't been the one to imply they came with the burger or hey!!!! say they are separate when you offer something additional to someone's order! I will not be coming back to this restaurant and I strongly recommend whoever is reading this finds somewhere else to go as well. So so many better places to eat and I walked into that bs",

Came upon Burger Brasserie and was seated right away around 8:45 on a Saturday, can not believe this place was not packed. Great Service - Nicolette was awesome, she was all over it. Great and I mean Great Shredded Beef Brisket Chili, a Cup is a very large portion as well. Small Wedge Salad was really good. I had the Chicken Burger on a fresh Onion Bun, really good, Ice Tea as well. $33 but worth it so tipped $7 and out the door with a full tummy and a smile on my face. I will go back when I get the chance.",

    "text": "Went there on my birthday last year specifically to order their 777 burger which in economic terms is the 1% of burgers. The meal itself costs $777 but that includes a bottle of Dom, without the fancy champaign the burger its $77 I believe. Enough with the repeating 7's the burger comes from the finest cut of Kobe beef, imported brie, caramelized onions, prosciutto, a lobster tail which is all topped off with an aged balsamic vinaigrette that made me fall to the floor. If you want a lengthy detailed description just check out my blog.   After my cousin and I devoured the burgers the Sous-Chef came to our table to thank us. After I told him it was my birthday he told me that he was going to make a custom dessert for the both of us. I accepted and what was brought out cannot be described (look at my blog again for pictures). I am not a fan of sweets but I felt obligated and had absolutely no shame stuffing my mouth.   After we assessed the damage which was very reasonable for what we ate we tried to finish off the drinks we ordered and I could not for the life of me ingest anything else. To this day I cannot say I have felt anymore full than I did that night. Our walk from Paris to the Venetian had to be one of the most grueling experiences of my life. I passed out at 9 pm, woke up at 2 and topped of my birthday celebration. Top notch food, great service and one of my best dining experiences makes me give this place a rare 5 star rating.",

Arrived at 4pm which is a strange between lunch and dinner time, but we flew in from the East coast and were hungry! The hostess and servers were pleasant, but not over-the-top friendly. It wasn't crowded at all, so we were seated immediately. I got the Shaft's Bleu Burger and boyfriend got the California Chicken Burger. The sandwiches don't come with fries, so they have to be ordered separately. We opted to share an order. Fries came out first, followed by the burgers right after. Everything was tasty. My burger had a great flavor balance, with the burger, bacon and cheese tasting great together. The California Chicken sandwich was good too. He asked for a side of pickles, which came out quickly when requested, but wasn't a fan because they were sweet rather than dill. The fries came with a spiced ketchup, but it still tasted like regular ketchup to us, which is fine. No complaints here overall, and we'd consider eating here again if in the area.",

Soooo here's the reason for only 3 stars...We went on a Sunday at 9:30 at night and the place looked pretty empty, however, we were told we would have to wait 30-40 minutes when there were clearly several empty tables . We decided to wait . Our waiter was very friendly, but, he was verrrryyy slow with delivery and not very attentive at all . We had to ask several times for for refills of water, drinks, etc . Once we finished our meal we had to wait an additional 25 minutes for our bill . Our waiter had just disappeared and we finally had to signal for the bus boy . Overall, if you have lots of time on your hands ... Def a must eat .. . But if you're on a tight schedule ... DO NOT even attempt .",

The food this time was my dissapointment. My boyfriend ordered a BLT and that was average. Seriously how could you mess up a BLT? I ordered the Buffalo chicken dip. The best part of this dish was the pretzel pieces. The chicken dip was overly greasy, unflavorfull, and the chicken tasted bad. That is if you could find the very small chicken pieces. I literally spit one bite out in my napkin because the chicken was rubbery, and tasted like it had gone bad. I tried this place twice. I will not be back.",

The waiter brought out a bunch of beers and set them off to the side next to our table (i'm assuming they wanted to bring out and serve all the drinks at once).   The problem was that they seemed to have forgotten about the beers and they just sat there for like 15 minutes getting warm.  Trying to get one of the server's attention was also quite the task.    Then the waitress comes and puts down a beer in front of my friend who picks it up to drink...and the waitress proceeds to grab the beer from his hand and says \"this one isn't yours!\"    What kind of waitress just grabs something out of your hand without saying something first?!  Anyways, the variety of fries they had were pretty good but not amazing.  The burgers were also very lackluster.  If you want a fancy burger stick to Burger Bar or Holsteins",

I really wish I got her name because she deserves some praise for being so nice and she had a smile the whole time. As soon as she sat us she asked us a sport question and if we got it right it was 10% off of our check. This was a great idea, it made the start of our experience really fun.   They had tv's everywhere! Which was good for me because the World Cup was starting and I didn't want to miss a thing. I didn't have any alcohol but it seems like they had a stacked bar and had beer on tap.  Our server (I believe her name was Rachel) was nice and got to us promptly. There were also other people coming around to help refill drinks and making sure we were ok.  I got the po boy sandwich which was really good! I haven't had anything like it. My mom had a burger which I had to taste and hers was really good as well, it was cooked perfectly and the meat they use is really good.  It was kind of weird that the entrees don't come with sides but the entrees are so big that you won't be hungry without a side.  But we did get the onion rings to share. I had to get them after seeing they were covered with cheeto dust!  Overall: great service, great food, will definitely be back!",

Friends wanted to grab a late bite to eat at 9:30pm on a Friday night.... only took about 5 minutes or so for them to prep a table for 7. The greeter was very nice and genuine... our server was nice and she dealt with indecision on our part smoothly. And we weren't rushed so it was nice to visit with friends.  So... we enjoyed the 100oz beer bong looking thing.... what's great is that there is a cooler thing in it so the beer stays cold... not that it took long to drink 100oz between 4 people.  Also, if you order this... you get to spin the Wheel of Discounts.... we didn't hit it big... just $5 off our bill....  I didn't order dinner.... just dessert.... the beignets.... which were NOTHING like the beignets from Cafe du Monde.... so I was pretty disappointed.  They were more like frozen creme puffs that were heated up.... the chocolate sauce was really thin like warm Hersheys syrup... but I think the whip cream was home made... it was silky and smooth.  Everyone else ordered dinner and it looked pretty darn tasty. The most appetizing-looking one was the Lamb burger.... I need to go back and check that out.  Also, their fries on the appetizer menu.... the one with blue cheese, bacon and avocado... yea... those ones.... were killer.  Prices seemed pretty reasonable considering it's a restaurant inside a strip hotel.  The 100oz beer was $30.... just to give you an idea.",

My coworker ordered the Paris burger with the Brie cheese and sauteed onions, she loved it. The burgers were cooked and seasoned perfectly.

    "text": "DAMN....this place was good.   We got a 2for1 entree from the Total Rewards booth and figured we would give it a shot. We have walked by the place several times through our many trips to Vegas. The place looks cool from the outside, with all the TVs on sports and all the great looking girls all dressed in their corsets and what-have you.   As we sat down, we were greeted by the waitress. My wife and I were starving and the first thing my wife asked for was the onion ring tower and she asked if she could rush it, because she was so hungry she was about to pass out. We saw her go around the corner and not even a minute later she flew around the corner with the onion rings. The waitress said she had taken someone else order. I don't know if that was the case or not, but it was great that she made it happen.  My wife and I each got the Kobe Burger, I added bacon on mine and my wife added avocado to hers. We tried each others and they were both juicy and very very good. They burgers are normally $20 ($19 for TR members), even if I paid full price, it would have still been worth it. We will make it a point to come back here every time we come back to Vegas. The service was amazing and the food was great too.   For the people who don't know, if you get a discount like 2for1 or something like that. Please tip your wait staff off of what the total bill would have been. They still worked for that money. And usually they don't give you half the service they normally would, just because you have a discount. They work hard for that money. Take care of them.",

The onion rings were cold and the onions were stale. Tasted like old onion rings. The chicken fingers and small potato skins were not much better. The hot wings were the best of the combo.  I also had the Le Paris Burger combo with a shake. Fries and shake were delicious. The taste of the burger was awful. The worst tasting beef that I've ever had.   Could get much better food someplace else for the price. Will not go back !!!",

The simple crafted burgers though are very good.  I had the blue and the wife had the brie burger.  They have a wide selection of buns to complete your burger as well.  The fries were ok.  We got the steak fries.  The service was very good.  The waitresses are dressed pretty provocatively so I dont know if I would bring too young of children in there.    They had the NCAA games on their many screens throughout the restaurant so this would be a great place to watch any of your sports desires.  Overall we really enjoyed it and if we were on this side of the strip would go back.",

I had waffle fries which were delicious and we split onion rings - perfectly fried and amazingly tasty.  I rounded out my meal with a strawberry frozen mojito - I literally chugged it down because I couldn't stop.  The food was delicious and the servings are huge - top that off with surrounding flat screens to watch all your favorite teams and you never have to leave.

The sandwich was huge and stuffed with shaved steak, mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese (she told them to leave out the peppers).  It came with au jus (which she did not use) and garlic aioli - great flavor!  The waffle fries are priced as a side, but you get a huge amount and they are very tasty.  Her coworker ordered the le classique burger in a combo.  This is a basic burger with choice of 1 added topping, she added cheddar cheese and said the burger was delicious.  Being a combo meant that it came with fries, she chose the steak fries and thought they were well cooked.  All together a great meal!  Maybe a little pricey for the type of food, but not bad at all when compared to other like meals on the Vegas strip!",

Which, due to the abovementioned method, I would end up getting full before I even get halfway through the meat patty.    Yet I find myself finishing Le Burger Brasserie's lamb burger with fried egg topping - must either be the lack of food from the day before, or the overexertion at Tryst the previous night, or neither.  Maybe the burger was just that much more superior than any other gourmet burger I've encountered.  On a side note - the designers of the Paris casino should've known better than to try to French-ize everything.  I can accept Le Burger Brasserie... But Le Car Rental? Give me a break.",

I needed a little fruit in my diet after eating mostly meat and potatoes.   Nothing note worthy to say about the sides.  I wish my cup of fruit was a little larger for the price ($5).",

    "text": "The first joint we hit up in the Paris Hotel happened to be the very first place we noticed walking through. 13 hungry dudes probably wouldn't agree to crepes nor some fancy schmancy high-end casino food just getting off one of the most turbulent flights we've ever experienced. No--not in Vegas. As a friend put it--you go BIG in Vegas. We wanted something to confirm our manhood, something to get our minds off that freakin' exhausting flight, something loaded with carbs and fat and protein and something soo unhealthy and expensive that we could consume to match the debauchery yet to be unleashed. We kinda wussed out on the Kobe beef. I'm talking about paying over $10 for a burger and I could proudly claim we did it here.",
