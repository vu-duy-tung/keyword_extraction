As soon as I walk in I make eye contact w/ one of the employees and she is putting food in her mouth while stocking up the salad bar. I know working in the food industry your a temped to have quick sample. But do not do it while working!! It's unsanitary to watch someone stock a salad bar and putting pickles in her mouth at the same time. Not once but twice. You are using the same gloves that you put that pickle in your mouth with, to touch other food with that same glove is not okay. Hopefully next time that is not the first thing I see when I walk in my favorite salad bar.",

The salads are the big reason why I go and both times the salad bowls were almost empty or a bit wilted looking. Even the seating,carpet, and lighting seem to be out of date.  The employees are trying there hardest. I say corporate should think about modernizing this location.",

A variety of soft drinks, beer and wine.  The price is incredibly reasonable. One could not produce this meal at home for what Sweet Tomatoes charges.  The only risk in coming here is eating too much . . . and taking in too much roughage.     Its a terrific place to grab a bite if you're hungry.   Long on vegetables, short on meat, worth coming in and taking a seat!

I usually pig out on the salad bar since their topping are stupendous and they even have my favorite for dessert: tapioca pudding!  If your'e looking for an inexpensive way to stuff your face with a healthy choice of foods, this is the place to go (just remember: a great salad with a ton of dressing isn't that healthy - haha)!",

The salad was just about the same as any other salad to me. I mean lettuce is lettuce, so it's hard to compare. Since it's a buffet, you had many options for your salad to choose from.

Food was fresh and yes there were at least 55 items on the salad bar.  Will have to admit the place was not fancy and the bathrooms were atrocious, but the food was wholesome.  In addition to the salad bar, there were several soups and a number of different breads, and a few assorted hot dishes like spaghetti and macaroni.  Dessert choices were plentiful; I had the hot brownie with soft ice cream and the sugar free mousse.  The place kind of reminded me of a busy kids camp.  The good news - great silverware.  The bad news - I could have stayed there all night chowing down.  Warning - if you are looking for protein, this is not the place for you.  The only protein I saw was on a pepperoni pizza.  Lastly, the place was reasonable: two of us ate for $30.",

For example in one month will be strawberry month - or pineapple month, and they will have salads and soups and or desserts infused with this favorite item. almost like Iron chef's \"Secret ingredient\". I love it. In the summer months they have different countries as their themes, Greece, Mexico, etc. I missed mexico's month by one day and I was not happy. There was an instance where I had Cream of Cauliflower soup and I have yet to ever see this delicious soup again. I always hope it will be there the nxt time I go.. ah maybe someday. Salads: They have all the toppings and ingredients you could ever want including pre-mixed salads i.e. caesar salad, asain salad and typically some broccoli salad. Really good.  Soups: they usually have various chii's and staples like chunky chicken noodle, cream of asparagus, chicken tortilla, santa fe black bean. mmm so good. This place is a must try. I used to use their bogo free coupons but they have a fine print item on them (if you join the veg club that says not valid i Nevada.) wth? That kinda upset me b/c why email it to me if you know I reside in NV? Ive only been back once since this altercation and that was to go tthe Mexico month- which I missed by one day b/c it didnt go to the end of the month, but only to the 28th. Arrgh.  Either way you have to try this place at least once.",

Sweet Tomatoes consists of one huge salad bar, a six soup bar, three pasta dishes bar, baked potato bar, and a dessert bar of some fruit, cottage cheese, pudding or apples. Everything is self serve, and they have fountain soda. Fountain pop? Fountain soda pop? Fountain cokes? What do Nevadans say? I haven't found out.  After four trips, I'm starting to find the salads monotonous. (Four trips to the restaurant, not the salad bar!) But when the urge to pack myself full of romaine and spinach is at hand, this is the best place to turn to in south Henderson.  Every day they have a lineup of homemade soups and chili. They tend to lack salt, but Sweet Tomatoes's whole raison d'etre is cheap healthy eating.  They have these fresh baked breads that are borderline pizza which are great.",

The food was fresh, I didn't see any wilted vegetables, the selection of salad toppings (ie, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, kidney beans, beets, etc.) were great!  There were about 8 different salad dressings to choose from.  They had about 8 soups to choose from, a couple pasta dishes (including mac&cheese) and the fruit selection was my only disappointment due to the small selection.  Soft serve dryers frozen yogurt (choco or vanilla) and the dessert was so-so.   My Review: GREAT for the price, staff was friendly and bussers were great at coming by and taking empty plates, atmosphere pleasant, restaurant was clean.  They have a great to-go deal that we'll be taking advantage of, you can create your own salad for just under $6 or add on a soup and some extras for about $8- a healthy option for sure!",

The soups are clearly watered down, the place smells like a retirement home, and they have turned 1/5 of the salad bar into \"premium\" pay toppings.  For $8.99 you can find dozens of better buffets.  Why do parents let their five and six year olds go up to get their own food?  I witnessed one kid touch every brownie on the tray before picking one.  When I told the girl behind the counter about it (and said they need to dispose of the tainted food) she just laughed it off.  \"They do that all the time.\"  Really?  That is called a health code violation.  Honestly, this place should be shut down its so dirty now.  Never again will we go here.  Never.",

The salad bar lacked protien and the chicken they sell you for $1.25 for 2 oz  is a joke. Supposed you want the chicken warm? The ones they sell you is in a plastic container and chills on ice. If you are really into healthy eating, chipolte is better or any of the other mexican types like that.  This palce has more non nutritious items than nutritious ones. Chances are I will never eat here again. It was my first time and I was disappointed.   Salad bar plus drink was almost $12 with tax. WASTE of MONEY.",

Then you can migrate over to the soup counter where they always have around 5-6 different types of soups to choose from. A lot of their soups are seasonal too, so it's always something different when you come.",

They also have pretty tasty soups and a little bit of pasta to munch on as well.  I would definitely recommend you hit up each and every one of the bread sticks b/c they are THE BOMB.  Plus, they switch their menu seasonally to keep their tastes fresh and appealing to us customers.  Sweet Tomatoes is convenient, fresh, and the staff is always very friendly.  The only downside is the price (I think it was $9.89 the last time I went for lunch) so be prepared to shell out some money for a nice salad lunch.  But, if you get on the email list, they give out coupons regularly so that's a +1.",

There's absolutely no guilt involved in eating endless salad. None! And the employees are always so friendly and on it with the table-bussing, I just had to send my compliments.  A few months ago, this location finally did away with its Fisher Price red plasticware and upgraded to grown-up china/glasses. The whole restaurant's completely revamped to the tune of decorative mason jars and a wall full of potted plants. Also, the early 90s-patterned carpet has been ripped out for a more modern wood. Everybody changes, it's life. Like aunts and uncles who try to stay hip with the times.  Unlimited basics: salad bar (do-it-yourself or specialty, I love their Caesar Asiago and Won Ton Happiness), soups (about 6 or 7 varieties on any given day), pasta (but nothing noteworthy), breads/baked goods (cornbread!), and frozen yogurt (mediocre, but fulfills dessert needs). There's also apples, oranges, and tapioca pudding, but I never touch that station. Also, they switch out a few of their menu items quite frequently. For example, March is Festa Italiana month.  Join their Club Veg and receive coupons. It'll save you a few bucks each trip. Oh, and the drink bar is phenomenal. Strawberry lemonade is their token star.",

Everyone got their trays of food and I went to bathroom to wash my hands after touching all the spoons and utensils everyone else had used to scoop food. A group of young girls had been sent in un-attended and proceeded to leave without flushing their poo or WASHING THEIR HANDS! Animal Style! Exiting restroom, I see these girls all over the dessert table! Scooping pudding, ice cream and the toppings on new dishes. Did I mention . . .THEY DIDN'T WASH THEIR HANDS? This is not the establishments fault just nasty parenting and why buffets gross me out. I would rate this higher in spite of untrained kids if the saladbar was at least clean.

I like going here when I'm not sure what I want to eat since it is AYCE, nearby, and they have salads which makes me feel healthier since I'm eating my veggies haha.   They usually have 3 different types of premade salads (Caesar Asiago, Wonton Happiness, and some seasonal salad that changes often). You can also build your own salad with various ingredients if you don't like any of the premade options. After getting your salad you pay and pick a table to eat at. You can get muffins, cookies, soups, pasta, and ice cream as well! As for drinks, I highly recommend trying a blend of sprite and the strawberry lemonade over ice for a refreshing, fizzy drink.   I'd recommend checking this place out if you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes (aka Souplantation) and are in the mood for salads, soups, and various baked goods. Be sure to sign up for their newsletter for the seasonal themes for the food and for coupons! I've never been here without a coupon xD.",

The souls were pretty good, a bit salty. The area was kept clean though.   For the price you pay, there should be a little more variety and perhaps some more healthy options (besides the salad)",

You get better variety of food & better variety for dessert, than at Sweet Tomatoes.  The good: Variety of salad options & salad dressing. Able use coupons they send in the mail.  The bad: Got charged for a kids buffet (did not have kids in line) & used a 20% coupon. The charges were reversed. When they voided out the charges, they did charge us for 2 adults with 1 drink...but, they did not apply the 20% coupon, though. They weren't paying attention.  A word of advice: Make sure you look at your restaurant receipt very carefully.",

They ran out of many items including brownies, baked potatoes, and bread and they didn't restock until I was leaving. And they also completely ran out of cookies and weren't planning on making more. The salad bar was decent, but everything else wasn't so great. So if you want strictly salad then it's worth a try, otherwise don't bother. Also make sure you look for coupons online before going. I registered on their website and got emailed a buy one get one meal, so it was just about $12.00 for two people.",

I did have a brownie, which wasn't anything to write home about. It was pretty dry. :( The area with the soup and breads didn't seem to have trays available, which was pretty inconvenient and was probably a contributing factor to me not eating more (maybe a good thing?) because I wasn't able to carry more back to my table.  We went here for lunch on a Friday. It was very busy, and we had to wait for a table to open up after we paid. Lots of families and kids.",

It is a relaxing and comfortable place to eat. However, the same can not be said for the bathrooms, unfortunately. They are simply disgusting -- like nasty gas station bathroom disgusting. Broken tile. Damaged stalls. Filthy counters. A few days ago we went to the restaurant and upon entering the bathroom (already nervous because it's always yucky) I discovered that the only urinal in the room was covered in a plastic garbage bag with an out-of-order sign on it. Super gross. My wife says the women's bathroom is always equally disgusting. This is where the employees do their business while preparing our food? It makes us question the cleanliness of the kitchen food prep areas. Yuck. We unfortunately will not be going back to the Henderson location of Sweet Tomatoes until their bathrooms are remodeled. I'd rather use the bathrooms at McDonalds.  I will happily change my review to 5-star once the bathrooms are remodeled to be clean, useful, and welcoming.",

You can seriously go up to the buffet a dozen times and still not try everything. Plus, all of it is fresh and replenished constantly.   There is also an area with soup and dessert choices. Loved the chicken soup - full of white meat chicken and delicious. Just so much to choose from here at a great price point. I was actually stuffed when we left and could not eat anything else.

We walked in and I had to go through about eight plates until we found one that did not have all the food on it. Every time we went for another plate, we had the same story. When they gave us our glasses, I grabbed the glass and it had stuff on the outside that I felt was real gritty and grimy the moment I touched it.  Later I saw them talking with the staff and showing tons of dirty glasses.   At one point I went through six soup bowls until I found one without old food in it. The soups were mediocre too bad. French onion was OK but lukewarm and would not melt the cheese.  All the other soups were subpar to not good at all, when they were really good the first time we went. After really looking forward to coming back a second time we will definitely not be back a third time.",

Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft.   The price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.  The service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here.",

Inside, the first thing is standing in line, cafeteria style and getting items for your salad. Once you get what you want there, there is a cashier where you pay. Of course it doesn't stop there! Once you find your table and eat, you can go to the other part of the restaurant and help yourself to more! They have soups, pizza bread, mac and cheese, and for dessert: ICE CREAM!  Since there was so much to try I only had small portions of whatever I got. Believe me by the end of the meal, you'll be FULL. After my salad, I tried their chili and mac and cheese. Their pastas are yummy. I would totally go for seconds... But I just had room for... DESSERT! Chocolate ice cream, yum. It didn't end  there though! A worker came around and gave everyone a sample of their freshly baked cookies. This time it was chocolate chip!  If you want to take more chocolate chip cookies home it's $2 a bag!  Didn't finish or want to take home food? They have containers at the front of the store for your convenience.",

It's a $15 AYCE DIY salad bar, after drink & tax. Hummph.  But it is a pretty good one, I suppose. I've hit it about five times and I don't have any gripes regarding quality.   And they have a fill-u-up on-the-cheap 'carbs' bar: potatoes, breads, pastas. And some desserts.  But you'll go entirely blind looking for a scrap of meat anywhere in this joint.   Oh wait ... there IS some creamy tuna salad pasta. I'll just get me about five plates of it ... then sort out all the little tuna bits.  For a $15 plate, you should expect more. As in \"more meat.\"  [Deleted here: the stuff about \"the business's extraordinary circumstances.\" You can look in Wikipedia, I suppose. But I think my own prior verbiage was much more entertaining.]  CONCLUSION: Again (for the moment) it's a good $15 plate of salad. If you really wanna pay that much for it. But where's the beef?",

The pasta was incredibly bland and lacked any kind of flavor. Variety of drinks was rather unimpressive. Brownies and muffins were not tasty at all. The walkways to get from the tables to the buffet were very narrow. I'm not sure I'll come back here real soon, but I might come here every once in a while. There's a ton of other restaurants on Stephanie that are honestly much better, like Outback and Corner Bakery. It's a very middle-of-the-road buffet kind of place.",

    "text": "Sweet Tomatoes is my #1 restaurant of all time! Subscribe to their newsletter for weekly coupons!  FOOD: I like that Sweet Tomatoes uses the buffet concept because I often just want to create my own salads and try different combinations. Their ingredients are extremely fresh. If you don't want to create your own salad, they often toss their seasonal salads for you to enjoy. From the hot foods section, they have delicious soups that change often. The chicken noodle soup is my favorite and is always available. They have baked potatoes that are pretty popular among customers. You can stuff it yourself with all the butter, cheese, sour cream, and bacon that you want. The pasta section is not that great. The mac n cheese is all I ever eat from there and I add bacon and sour cream to it. Lastly, they have great pizza bites that go well with ranch dressing.  DESSERT: You can never go wrong with soft serve ice cream. They even have dry toppings and chocolate syrup! They also have a fruit bar that includes seasonal fruits, jello, pudding, and mousse.  DRINK: Sweet Tomatoes has a drink bar that allows you to serve your own drink. There is everything from water to soda to hot tea to coffee to their freshly made lemonades and iced teas. I often see people getting creative by mixing drinks. Sweet Tomatoes also have seasonal drinks like Limenade for St. Patrick's day.  ATMOSPHERE:Sweet Tomatoes is a buffet will a focus on salad and soup.  NOTE: Yes, it's a buffet, but they work hard to clean your tables so it doesn't hurt to leave a small tip.",

    "text": "Sweet tomato is a \"vegetarian/ vegan\" salad bar that also carries soup, pasta, baked potatoes, pizza and dessert. I love the salad bar and healthy choices but i'm don't go very often because there are only rarely any vegan choices. There are usually 3 prepared salads and most of the time none of them are vegan. There are usually around 10 salad dressings and only 1 or 2 will be vegan. They sometimes have a few vegan choices such as coleslaw near the salad. Then the soup. Out of 8 I'm lucky if 2 are vegan. Usually it's only 1. And the is no pasta or dessert that's vegan. I find this unusual. I mean it's a salad bar. There should be more vegan options. Half of everything could easily be made vegan.  There is a pasta with a tomato sauce which could be vegan.  And they could make a pizza without cheese and just extra sauce and veggies. Also the are tons of desserts they could add that would be vegan. It amazes me that there are many restaurants that have many many more vegan choices than sweet tomato. In hope that one day they will step up their game and have more cruelty free choices.",

My gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads.   Service is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???  And something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks????   In the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                      The pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there..   The funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed!  I guess people love a so so place.  I dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!!   I'm just sayin,,,,",

    "text": "The reason I am giving Sweet Tomatoes two stars is because of the salads and soups. I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.  This last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.  Another thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges. The other items were chocolate pudding, jello, and another pudding I could not identify. Fresh fruit? I don't think so.",

There was only one gal working the salad area and both registers. She was doing her best, but no one seamed to care she was struggling to keep up. After getting our food and taking a bite or two we were told the restaurant was now closed and we would have to take our food to go. I was with friends from out of town and where did they think we were going to go to eat out food? in one of our cars? I would have went to a drive through if I wanted to eat in my car. Plus the manager whimped out and had a bus boy tell the people they had to leave.  He couldn't even do it himself. The busboys english was very poor and we were not quite sure what he was trying to tell us. Another very nice customer explained what was going on. We were told there was a water main break some where in the neighborhood and the place could not stay open without water. We understood but the manager should have told us and should have comped our meal or offered us some kind of coupon for a future visit. It was handled very poorly. Don't suggest you visit this location. Dirty and poorly managed.",

    "text": "Oh Sweet Tomatoes how I USED to love you... Seems like this location has gone way down hill. Went for dinner with my hubby on a Thursday night at 445pm to try and beat the crowd. So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad! After seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty.  Knowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time. Guess I will head back to the 215/Flamingo location with higher hopes. That one always seemed to hit the mark.",

    "text": "An update as I have visited Sweet Tomatoes quite often in the last couple of months.  It's mostly some little gripes that I have and I need to vent. Sweet Tomatoes seems to have an obsession with Asiago cheese. They have 3 types of focaccia  bread, all of them with Asiago Their 2 main salads have Asiago cheese.  Seriously?   I personally don't like Asiago and would like to see some more variety or at least use a more universally accepted cheese (mozzarella would be nice). Or at least don't mix it everywhere!  Then another staple salad they have, Won Ton Chicken barely has any chicken! Why not call it Won Ton salad?  And what about the desserts? The warm apple cobbler tastes like a homemade one, with large chunks of fresh apple and pleasantly sweet, but not overly so, syrup.   Sweet potatoes with maple butter are amazing, definitely try these.  The brownie muffins and fudge brownie are not always sweet (sometimes they're just right, others time they have a dark chocolate taste but the fudge brownie really lacks the \"fudge\", it tastes \"watered down\" somehow).  Banana bread muffins are nice and soft with a pleasant taste of banana (no banana chunks) as are the apple cinnamon muffins.  The sugar free chocolate mousse is amazing as always, light and fluffy.   The soft serve ice cream is actually yogurt and you can't really tell the difference. There's a choice of toppings like chocolate and caramel syrup, chocolate sprinkles, nuts and cookie crumbles. The cookie crumbles are relatively dry and hard, they're not \"cookie dough\" chunks you're used to seeing in ice cream.  Overall good for a salad buffet with healthy dessert alternatives.  Keep in mind that Sweet Tomatoes (slighly) change their menu every 2 weeks(ish) so some items may be missing while others are always there.",

We were there on a busy Sunday afternoon and the place was packed, and I noticed the employees were doing a great job keeping things moving... from the cashiers to the hostess who led us to our table to the person cleaning up our section, everyone working there seemed to be hustling, which is nice to see. The food was the usual for a Souplantation, which is to say it's mostly what you expect: fresh and no-frills (salad bar, chicken noodle soup, baked potatoes, soft serve, etc.), but there are also some flashes of brilliance on the menu (the special couscous was excellent, as was the creamy mushroom soup). Bottom line, if you want to stick to your budget but still eat healthy (ok, and maybe sneak in some cheesy bread and soft serve at the end of your meal!), this is a great place to go.",

For eight to ten dollars this is a great deal. They have two signature salads that are served all the time. The Caesar is refreshingly light and not overtly creamy or heavy. The other is an Asian chicken salad which is tangy and sweet. This is the only option of getting meat in your salad without paying the additional two dollars for a tiny container. There is also a third specialty salad that changes every month.  Sweet Tomatoes offers an endless amount of options and toppings for the herbivores.  I always start with two plates, one for the specialty salads and one to create my own masterpiece. By the end of the line, everyone around seems impressed by how much I manage to stick onto one plate. It resembles a mountain more than a salad.   The staff are friendly and very attentive. When one container starts to look shabby or low, they will swap it out while making small talk.   They always have a large selection of soups, breads, pizzas, and pastas, but what I love the most are the sweets.  My favorites are the chocolate lava cake, warm brownie, or the fresh baked cookies. What goes best with any of these selections? The fat-free Dreyer's soft serve ice cream. If given the option, I would put ice cream on almost anything. Tell me it is fat-free and it is likely that you will see me with my mouth open directly under the dispenser.",

The same soggy wonton salad---and a chicken with honey mustard that was pretty tasteless...fortunately, there are alot of toppings to spruce up these very bland salads--and you would think after not going there for awhile that 'maybe' there would be something new and different to try---I have never seen the orange salad again since I first went there and it was very good---guess it was discontinued because of price.  The soups are always good--cream of mushroom is my favorite and tomato is my husbands fave,  The coffee was hot this time, the muffins and brownies and mousse are a happy ending---and the staff is generally very pleasant.  But they stopped coming around a long time ago with free hot cookie samples---and they don't go above and beyond anymore--guys, there are ALOT of restaurants in this area....if you want people to keep coming back then stop raising your prices--and make the coupons worth it--so we feel like we actually saved something, keep the salads fresh and tasty and not old and soggy, and make sure your customers are satisfied so you dont lose out to the competition!",

The food however was good as usual, and the staff was pleasant.   Now comes the very disappointing moment...my wife and I went to the bathrooms to wash our hands to discover that the bathrooms are in disrepair! The sinks have large brown iron stains, the countertops were falling apart, the surface on the bathroom stalls was falling off and the bathrooms were just very very unsanitary!  My wife walked out immediately without washing her hands because of the filth.  How can the employees keep themselves, their hands clean if the bathrooms are unsanitary!  Should of checked the bathrooms first and eaten somewhere else.",

They had ran out of cups so they gave us paper ones. There was no where to sit because of how many dirty tables there were. No one was cleaning up. Then at the soup and pasta part there were no soup bowls and everything was super dirty. One lady who worked there was going to get cones and I didn't wait long enough for her so she said \"or not\" in a super loud voice. Lastly, there was no ice in the ice machine or toilet paper in the restrooms. Overall poor experience and the company has really gone down hill. Definitely not worth almost $15 a person.",

I had an iceberg lettuce based salad which was really watery and I didn't finish it. It's like they rinsed the lettuce a ton, but never drained it. My vegetable soup was good as was my dessert. My brownie was fresh out of the oven and literally melting in my mouth! YUM! The girls had soup and salad as well. However, their darker leaf salad didn't seem to have the issues mine did. I liked the fact that the kids can help themselves to food and drink. In addition, they loved the fact that they could serve themselves soft serve ice cream and load up on the toppings. My biggest issue here was that the staff wasn't picking up our table's empty plates in a timely manner. I took a photo of some of our stacks of plates, and I wasn't happy to be trying to eat around them. Overall, it was a decent lunch though and Yelp gave me a 15% off coupon when I checked in!!!!  The pros - a good selection of soups and salads, clean environment, self serve drinks and food make it convenient.  The cons - parking was a challenge at lunch on a Friday and the staff didn't clean up our plates in a timely manner.",

(Fun fact: in southern California this chain is called Souplantation. Hence, the soups.) They also have a small area for ice cream and other desserts.  Vegetarians and vegans will love it here. They do have some products with meat, such as the soups and the occasional chicken salads, but most of the restaurant is designed with a herbivore in mind.

The salad bar is fresh and there is a lot of different toppings for all tastes.  Lots of beverage options as well.  The soups are my favorite.  There will always have their classics but some of their rotations are delicious.  I always look forward to seeing what they have.    It is simple, affordable, and no fuss.  You can make it as healthy or not as you want.  Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.   PS: 15% off your bill with Yelp check in!!!",

The idea and concept of having an All-You-Can-Eat Salad and Soup Buffet Style is very enticing and it's a great place to eat healthy! One thing I'm certain is this restaurant will always be my favorite go-to spot when I am craving for a ton of salad. I always pile my plate full of greens with an array of pretty colorful condiments. I was hoping they have the Asian Ginger Broth soup but it wasn't available. So I got the Chicken Noodle Soup which is still a good choice. The nice thing about this restaurant is that they do offer a variety of food choices like cold and hot pasta, focaccia bread and pizza, and an assortment of dessert such as fresh fruits, muffins, soft-serve ice cream and pudding. Signing up to receive discount coupons via email is a major plus on savings.",

It's very clean and you can tell that they want you to have a good experience there. It's always clean and well maintained.   I went last night for dinner for the very first time in the 5 years I've been eating here and it was AWFUL! The cashiers shirt was almost all the way undone, being that it was two sizes too small. Our  busser seemed to be the ONLY one on shift for quite awhile so in all honestly she didn't even deserve a tip. Especially after we witnessed her filling the teas and such, at the beverage bar. She spilled over half the strawberry lemonade on the counter top, it was EVERYWHERE, and she didn't clean it up. She filled all three other liquids there so there's no way she didn't seem the bright red substance, all over be place. The floor had lettuce, crumbs and napkins all over it. Every counter top, where you went to get food, was covered in crumbs or food. Some food even had bites out of it! The frozen yogurt machine hadn't been cleaned, for what looked like at least since noon. Mind you, this was at about 6pm. Most of the food was old and had been sitting under the heat lamps for hours. I was excited to try all of the Asian style specials until I saw that the chicken had been under the lamps for so long that it as rock hard and see through. Also, every muffin was hard as a rock. It was a waste of $25. That's for sure!   I absolutely love this place but I will NEVER be back for dinner. I was appalled at how horrible the staff maintained the establishment. How embarrassing!! It's fairly obvious that the day shift is the better and more caring shift.",

The potato leek soup is also very tasty. And when they have thier lentil and spinach soup I am a fan of that too. However their tomato soup is KILLER. I mean to die for. It basically demolishes anything else on their menu. I want some now just thinking about it.  If you are going here with a die hard meat eater, skip this place. For veggie lovers only. And every month, they have a new \"flavor\" or featured item so the soups and premade salads always vary.  Next time you are there, get a baked potato and top with their chili and some shredded cheese. Pure yummy goodness.  and you cant go wrong with their foccacia bread sticks. especially dipped in some yummy soup.",

The last visit was one of the miss times for me I went up to the bread station 2 different times and there were like 2 or 3 pieces of bread left and some of the muffins were hard. The pasta station was ok for the most part, and some of the soups seemed a bit old they had thicked up which happens when they have sat for a long time. The salad bar was stocked and fresh which was nice, the drink area was messy as were a lot of the tables, we had to find someone to clean off an empty table so we could sit down because there was several empty tables that were not cleaned off. You would think with the volume this store gets they should be able to keep up. The staff that rings you up is friendly but the people who are suppose to clean off the tables not so much, nor are the ones in the soup and bread area, I asked about a soup and the guy turned like he didn't hear me and went into the back, I was trying to fig out what days they have the clam chowder i know the one in St Louis always had their on friday. I just feel like this place is just all over the place i mean how hard is it to run a soup salad bread and pasta buffet?",

It was a Friday and I was excited to eat their usually creamy and tasty Clam Chowder. Today it was awful!! It tasted like dirt. My mom got their chili which she usually loves and tasted terrible too. I tried it and it was like eating a tin can. Bad just bad! After that I couldn't even eat anything else.  This was the first time I've ever left here hungry! Glad I had a coupon or I'd be even madder if I paid full price. You can't charge those kinda prices if your going to serve crap! Step it up Sweet Tomatoes! I won't be back any time soon.",

Didn't realize it was a buffet like California Fresh but when we walked in that is what it reminded us of.  However they had way more choices of greens and salads and toppings. The place was way busier so the food looked fresher and rotated more often. After you get through the salad part you pay and go around to the many soups and breads and they even make fresh stir fry pasta dishes right there. Overall I really liked the place they had gluten free options of muffins and they had like 6-7 different soups tons of varieties of greens and veggies.  I liked the fact it was a popular place and you know the food was fresh and not sitting out all day.  I would visit again for sure.",

In addition to people improperly handling the utensils there were solicitors looking for us to buy food and we were already eating food so moot point right. Hats off for Candice and Evan, those two managers totally Rock.  They both handled my dilemma that I had before coming to Sweet Tomatoes beautifully. Candice initially was going to handle it but she was off,  so Evan ended up handling the matter and they did a great job working together as a team. Great job Sweet Tomatoes.",

    "text": "If you've never been to this chain, here's my basic buffet-exploration strategy: get one plate of stuff in the salad line, take small amounts of anything you want to try, then sample any soups, bread items, or pastas that you think you'd like. Only after that should you go back for seconds. I think I ignored the perhaps underrated soups too much in my early days, but I'm making up for it these days, and the classic shrimp bisque (seasonal item) was quite good, as was the chili. Throw in your choice of toppings such as oyster crackers and cheese and you've got quite a treat. Watch out for the chicken pot pie stew next week or in the future too, and if they ever bring back that golden yam bisque, mm mm!  Don't forget dessert. They have pretty good fruit, but I always flock to the fro-yo. Dreyer's/Edy's is the best frozen yogurt that I've ever had at any sort of buffet, and there's some decent toppings available (although I still mourn the loss of toffee bits).  I've been to this location 3 or 4 times, but I haven't bothered to write a review before for some reason. On one of those visits, I remember being fairly impressed that the employees sang happy birthday to someone here, so that was nice. The big plus side of this location is the granola breakfast cereal that they serve on Sunday mornings (along with the rest of their breakfast menu, which I highly recommend). I haven't seen the granola anywhere else. The big minus is that it's the least spacious of all the locations that I've been to, even to the point that they didn't have tuna tarragon for some reason this morning. I thought that they'd always carry this classic, which is one of my favorites pre-mixed salads, but nooo.... Also, they were out of tortillas for some reason when we first got here and wanted breakfast burritos, but they brought them out later.  In spite of not feeling good enough about this location to bestow upon it all 5 stars, I'm always very happy to eat here and I hope that I'll introduce a lot of friends soon.  P.S. Has anybody bothered to stack a plate or two with premium toppings? I'm thinking of doing that some day if I wanna splurge...",

Salad, soup, and some pizza/pasta/bread based things.  And some desserts.   If you're hankering for a little something a bit better for you, this place is a good place to be.  And contrary to another review that said these don't exist on the East Coast, I can definitely say that they do since there was one pretty close to home.  The price is... ehh...    a little hefty for a soup and salad place, but it's expected just as anywhere else.",

    "text": "Last night a few of us did our newly appointed, Friday night shenanigans.  Tonight we came to Sweet Tomatoes because of the value and location.  Salad, soup and dessert bar was about $10.99.  Now this place wouldn't be the first choice when I think of great grub, but my decision was out numbered.  Here's what I thought:  AMBIANCE:  The place is like a buffet joint.  You walk in, grab your tray and plate and then you start building your salad.  The decor isn't something to be excited about.  This place tries to fill a lot of people in a such a small space so there's not much of privacy, even at your table.    FOOD:  Although the ingredients are super fresh, the salad bars were sloppy and food was everywhere.  I also appreciate that there's a huge selection of salad fixings, however, I can't stand the fact that places like Sweet Tomatoes tries to upsale and already high priced buffet with \"premium toppings,\" like chicken or artichokes.  C'mon!  Get out of here with that.  Like any other buffet out there, it should be included.  I thought their premade Chinese chicken salad tasted good.  It was sweet and offered great texture with the won tons.  The Dill Potato Salad was really bland and not too good.  When it came to the soups, I loved the clam chowder and turkey chili.  I also love the fact that they have an area with all the possible toppings for your soup.  Remember that when you come here, do not miss out on the pizza type bread they have there.  It's located between the pasta and the soups.  SOOOO GOOOD!!  April, apparently, was their \"Lemon month.\"  They served things like lemon muffins, a lemon pasta with capers and lemon molten lava cake.  The molten cake was way too tart for my taste buds.  Lastly, for dessert, I LOVE and LOOK FORWARD to their soft served ice cream.  You can choose to put your ice cream in a bowl or small cones.  They also have caramel or chocolate sauce and a bunch of toppings.  YUM-O.  Last night, I think I actually got full from all the desserts they have.  All in all, I think this place is alright.  In a city filled with buffets, many of which are worth the price, unfortunately, I don't think Sweet Tomatoes fits in that same value.  If you're looking for a salad buffet joint, Sweet Tomatoes is a great option.  Just be sure to come early because parking is very limited!",

At the end of the salad bar waits the cashier and rings you up for either lunch or dinner (it's a set price so go for it!)  Take your seat and they have a drink station that offers teas, sodas, juiced and even milk!  Another section offers hot soups and muffins and breads and even build your own baked potatoes! Also two different types of macaroni and cheese dishes! Their dessert selection offers several different choices but their chocolate lava cake is fabulous, and throw in some of their soft serve and I'm a happy girl!

From the massive salad bar, with super fresh toppings, always filled to the brim, to the baked potatoes, pizza, chili, bread, many, many soups to the pasta...and so on! Something is always coming up ''fresh'' and you don't have to wait long. I really have never had a bad experience here. The staff is friendly, the 'servers' very attentive at clearing plates. They keep the place nice and clean. Yes, it's a family friendly restaurant so there are going to be kids.   The strawberry lemonade is DELICIOUS and I'm so glad they made it a regular part of their line. Now they just need to add in that delicious cucumber dressing they had once, and I'll be totally happy.   I love Sweet Tomatoes. With the coupons online it's a really good deal for all that freshness. Custom made salad, soups, fresh baked breads, pasta, baked potatoes, ice cream, brownies, make your own sundaes.... What's not to love???",

Have the Green Giant sprain his ankle or was it an off day for them?  When I walked into Sweet Tomatoes at 1:00 pm,  there was a very slow moving line, because one of the register had some kind of software issue, and they had to deal with two lanes at the same time.    That girl looked like she was holding it together, but you could tell she wanted  to reach out, and touch that computer in a very nasty way.   It wasn't that long of wait, but it got a little worse.  The soups were messed up on this day, and the chicken noodle had more soup base than chicken and noodle, and there some rendition of a  Greek Lemon soup that was barely okay, and on that day...no french onion :(      The pastry area are usually a winner, and brownies are great, but the Blueberry muffins been taking a nose dive as of late.    Sweet Tomatoes use to make their muffins with some large blue berries that use to load up the whole thing, but in my first one on this trip only had four small blue berries in the entire muffin.    I had that flashback of the movie, Casino; when two blue berry muffins was an argument on how' the casino coffee shop was messed up  for being inconsistent like the rest of the operation.    The waitress didn't care too much on this visit, but they cleared up tables when they had too, which made me think the General manager was off for the day.  Don't get me wrong it could have been a off-day, and I'm still fan of this place, but on this trip is was more than less of a bad visit.         .",

I hope someday they expand, because the only thing I don't like is how crowded it can get.

I didn't even know about Sweet Tomatoes (Souplantation) until I was at a workshop in Orange County, where there was an advertisement.  I went on the web and saw that there were Vegas locations so as soon as I had some time, I dragged the Mrs. here to try them out.  Sweet Tomatoes is like Souper Salad but better.  More selection of salad items and soups, fresher looking and tasting bread and pizza.  Even Marian loved it!  The salad choices were very good but my favorites were the cream of mushroom soup and the garlic Asiago focaccia bread.

Yes, there are lots of salad and topping options, plus an acceptable soup and carb station. Everything is \"fresh\" in the sense that it doesn't often seem like it's been sitting out all day.   That being said.. you know those bags of already-cut-up salad they sell at the supermarket? To me, they never taste as good as when you buy an actual entire head of lettuce. They always taste more bland and maybe just a little plasticy. This is what the lettuce here tastes like. The other toppings also look and taste like they came out of a factory / bag.   But can you really expect hand-chopped salad and fresh-grated cheese for $10 a head for dinner? Not so much.  Busser/server Amandi is the most hyper, friendly person you'll ever meet. Sometimes she can be a little obnoxious / intrusive, but I would much rather interact with someone like her than someone who is rude or negligent. And you can't fault a girl for having spirit! Last time we were there, we told her it was our friend's birthday, and she made him a happy face cookie with ice cream and got the cashiers to sing him happy birthday.

That said, the salads here are quite nice and great to customize, the vegetables seemed fresh and the dressings and croutons very good. The soups on offer the day we came, cush as chili and chicken pot pie soup, were tasty as well. Desert was nothing special, just soft serve and a couple types of fruit. Still, I was satisfied and I'll certainly come back again.",

They have an incredible good selection of salads and toppings to put on! And don't forget about the wide variety of soups to pair with those salads! I also found that the little breadsticks and or pizza things they had were good as well! Lastly the tiny little ice cream cones are adorable! Ha! I will most definitely return..",

From the moment you walk in the line splits down a seemingly mile long salad bar that has anything you could imagine for a fantastic salad!  From some pre-made varieties, to everything you need to make your dreams come True, to housemade dressings you never thought existed!  Once paid and seated the selection of roughly eight different soups are there for the offering!  My personal favorites here include: mushroom, broccoli and cheddar, clam chowder, and black bean!  Sometimes you just need the healthier options to kinda cleanse your soul!",

As soon as you enter you grab a plate and tray before choosing one side of the salad line. You'll make your salad as you move along. At the end is the register where you'll pay and get cups for drinks. From there you'll take a seat and then there is an additional buffet area.  The salad bar coming in is the spot to create your own green salad. Just about every topping and dressing you can imagine is available. There are also pre-made salads combinations and pasta salads in this section. The second buffet area has pastas, breads, flatbreads, a baked potato bar, soups, fruit, and a soft serve machine.   The seating areas as well as the buffet areas were clean. Employees were circulating to grab dirty dishes and keep the tables cleared for incoming customers. There is a card on the table to set out to indicate if you are still eating or when you are finished eating.   This is definitely not the best food or atmosphere available, but for the cost it definitely exceeded my expectations. Coupons are available from several sources making it even more affordable.",

It is a buffet style that starts out with building your own salad. FYI for my California friends - this is the same as Soup Plantation!  I wasn't particularly impressed with this location. I thought the selections were decent. Everything was refilled as needed and on time. The one night I went to this location, I really enjoyed the creamy tomato soup. I had a major craving for clam chowder tho (like every day), and sadly I found out they only have it on Fridays.  Service was good. I do think the place could be a little bit cleaner, especially considering it was a quiet night when my family stopped by. I like Sweet Tomatoes but would probably only come back to this location if we're ever in the area.",

Dirty plates can start to pile up on tables and sometimes it seems like they could use some extra help clearing plates and cleaning tables.

We drive passed one while running errands at Galleria Mall and knew we had to stop in!  It was exactly as we remember it. My favorite salad there is actually a staple on the menu - win! My parents particularly loved the soups and the cranberry apple cobbler this visit. My faves are the wonton happiness salad, Joan's broccoli madness and the mac and cheese.   Employees were nice. I got up to take a picture of one of the food signs for my mom and the gentlemen behind the counter was ready to solve problems until I told him she just wanted to recreate it at home.   I wish their were more drink options. I recall our old Sweet Tomatoes having a cookie bar as well which I miss. One of the breads, possibly the focaccia was way too spiced up, as in too much ginger, I immediately spit it out. The linguine alfredo was ok, not as flavorful as I would've liked.   Overall a great, moderately healthy food stop. Be sure to check in for the savings!!!",

Please be aware that there is no meat. My friend that is a vegetarian appreciated this!   I really liked their mac and cheese and other pasta options. Their dessert area is limited but good. I tried their blueberry muffin and soft serve ice cream and I liked it.   My recommendation is to look for offers and coupons online. I checked in with Yelp and received a 15% coupon which is nice to be able to save!  The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because it seemed that there were a couple of food options that did not get refilled quickly enough. I went to the salad bar multiple times and they always seemed to be out of something. They were also out of the chocolate ice cream serve which was my friends favorite. I did make up for this by putting a delicious brownie under my ice cream.   Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely be back!",

    "text": "Sweet Tomatoes is pretty cool especially for vegetarians and vegans. The vegetarian choices are plenty. Vegans can do fewer things. But it's a healthier option for even meat eaters. Caution yourselves on the ingredients...everything is not clean or natural in the restaurant. There are some things (like the French catalina dressing) that contain suspect chemicals. Been to this location a couple of times and it's cool for the most part. They had some issues with clean dishes and lipstick on the glasses....had a much better experience the first visit. Management seemed a little lack luster this go around. I will still give it another whirl because the first time everything was great. I would recommend that they do a few more vegan options like making one of the pastas vegan as well. Good job for a fast casual type of chain. I will be back.",

I love being able to make my own salad exactly how I like it. There is definitely a lot of choices. The ingredients seem to be pretty fresh. I really like the Honey Mustard dressing and croutons. They standout. They have 4 different cheeses, which is awesome. (Regular shredded cheddar, blue cheese, feta, and another kind that I'm not sure what it is,  My favorite things are the chicken noodle soup. When I don't feel good I crave this stuff. (add fresh ground pepper) In November they have a delicious stuffing soup. It's soo good I can't get enough of it.. Mac and cheese (add grated cheese and fresh ground pepper) I don't eat pork, but my friends adds bacon to hers. I've also tried peas.   Baked potato.. Put it in a bowl, open it up and put cheese in it asap, so that it starts to melt.   I also like to get cauliflower and broccoli and dip it into Thousand Island dressing. Reminds me of my childhood.   Chocolate muffins are usually pretty good.   The best part is often during your meal someone will come around with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Eat them while they are hot, so much better.   Sign up for the rewards program, they sound out a fair amount of coupons.    Pro tip: Get two plates; 1 for salad and 1 for other stuff. efinitely a lot of choices.    Staff is usually friendly and patient.",

We use to go to this one all the time when we lived closer to it, It was always one of our favorite salad places, We think it is a better deal of course when you can find a coupon to go because their regular prices have gone up so much over the years, As with anything , We love the salad choices, I just love their oriental salad I think it is a peanut sauce,. its so good! And the soups are amazing. The focaccia I think it is called which comes out like a pizza is go good especially when it first comes out!  The soups seem to change but everything else is about the same everyday, We would go back to this location, it seems to be pretty consistent. As for service sometimes they clean the table pretty fast depending on how busy they are. Over all it is always pretty good.",

But there is a long salad bar which you can fill your plate to your hearts desire, then you pay. Dinner is about 11$. Grab yourself a seat in a booth or table, then you can head up to their hot food bar where they have soups of many varieties as well as some tasty pastas.   Everything was pretty good. The most impressive thing about the restaurant was how fresh everything was. The vegetables seemed fresh picked and sliced, the pastas tasted like they were hot off the stove, and bread was right out of the oven.   In the end, everything was pretty good and reasonably priced. It wasn't groundbreaking or life altering in any way, but worth the trip once in a while if you want to feel healthy and not break the bank.",

I mean, really loud and crowded.  I felt like I was sitting in 20 different families' living rooms.  Parking was nothing short of a nightmare, and we wound up walking over from the far part of Goodwill's lot.  We had a coupon though so even though the parking situation should have signaled us to move along we moved forth to get our cheap salad on.    They have premixed salads here that are pretty good.  And they have a ton of salad options so you can make a pretty rockin' creation.  They even have some premium toppings that are really good but at 2.95, I think, for one time around, the premiums are a bit of a rip off if you ask me.    We went during \"italian week\" and I was pretty disappointed by the breads/pizza/pasta.  Reminiscent of a Cici's buffet.  The desserts were just eh.  The brownie bites were rock hard at the edges.    I loved the drink options.  Great iced teas and lemonades all around.   The service was decent and they were really good about clearing old plates.    They gave us a coupon for the next time but my husband just left it because he was so disappointed.  We'll just make a salad at home next time...",

Being vegetarian, it's hard to find a place that focuses on salad as the main buffet draw. There is also soup and fresh baked bread, and along with baked potato, pasta and dessert stations. The pasta does leave a bit to be desired.  I usually doctor up their mac & cheese with toppings from baked potato bar (sour cream, shredded cheese, hot sauce, etc).  it may not be the best food in the universe, but I love it.

    "text": "This place offers some great food at good prices.  All their foods are homemade. Make sure to ask about any allergies you might have- since they make them they should be able to tell you what's in them.  And they change their menus at least monthly so you need to go at least once a month do you don't miss out on some of their great salads, yummy soups, and delicious desserts.  My personal favorite are their soups and baked items, but their salads really are good, too.  And so are their drinks, for that matter- hubby loves their strawberry lemonade.  But back to their soups- if you ever see their tomato soup- GRAB IT!! Same with their mushroom soup (& I don't usually like mushrooms). And I always make a point of grabbing some of their chicken noodle- their noodles are nice and thick.  Their signature desserts are almost always great, but it's hard to say what to get because they always change them, so just make sure you come often so you can try them.  Oh! I've been told they don't put the signature dessert out until after 4:30, so be aware of that.  Regarding the muffins- blueberry is good. The brownies are okay but can become hockey pucks unless you get them fresh out of the oven. And what has struck me as strange- the gluten free muffins are almost always my favorite muffin when I'm there, and they frequently change what flavor those are, too, so make sure to try those :)",

First you get a tray and put a plate on top. You'll see the salad first and whatever you fancy you can put it on your plate.   I usually like getting extra olives, mushrooms and jalapenos so I can use that in my chili and also in my pizza slices.   The hot food will be after you pay the cashier. Then you can grab your drinks and soups, desserts and pastas.   Overall I love the variety of the food here and the flavor could be light or heavy depending on what you want to put on for yourself.   Also I love their chicken noodle soup. I usually add chopped green onions on top to make it have a little spice to it.",

    "text": "I never gave this place a try because as a kid, I was very picky and hated salad.  Since then it has flown under my radar even though it's by my house and has been open for years.  My friend suggested it the other day and since my palate has grown exponentially since being a child, I decided to give it a go and I honestly was quite surprised.    For whatever reason I thought it would be the vegetarian equivalent of Golden Corral and I am so glad it isn't!  Walk in, we got our coupons (two meals for $25) which wasn't bad seeing as how we stuffed our faces.    The salad bar was filled with three prepared salads (leaves), two prepared pasta salads, and at least 20 individual ingredients to make your own salads.  Beyond that there were around 6 different soups, rolls, cheesy bread, three other types of pasta, and a myriad of desserts and drink choices.  The salads and cheesy breads were all quite good and the ingredients were fresh.  The pastas and soups were just alright, not the best but not the worst.  The desserts were probably the worst part.  They looked amazing but something just wasn't right about them.  The molten brownie cake had a weird flavor and the cookies were almost stale.    Overall, quite a surprising trip and a pretty good meal overall.  I thought this would be a super healthy option but after all of the pasta I had, I take back that opinion (if only I had some self-control!).  The staff, I must add, was also super friendly and helpful.  I would for sure go back and now that I tried a good majority of what they have to offer, I will stick to what I know is good.",

I personally like salads and I know I don't eat enough of it so this place is great for that. I can stuff my face full of leafy greens and feel like I got my monies worth.   After you have eaten your veggies like a good boy or girl you can go over to carb corner ( I don't know the official name). There they have pastas, pizza, 8 different soups, muffins, potatoes and several other things. The Mac and cheese is my favorite! It's so creamy and so yummy. Normally my all time favorite is fettuccine Alfredo but there it's not that good. They do have some  Parmesan cheese that you can doctor it up with. The soup section is fun...well about as much fun you can have with soup. I like to get a ladle full of each soup to try each one. Today they had Asian Ginger Broth. It was sooooo good. I ate 4 bowls of it. It doesn't have anything in it. Just broth but it's so good. Once I took some of the noodles from the chicken soup and put it in the Asian Ginger Broth and it was good that way too.   When you are done with that section you can now have your dessert. What I like to do is get a soup bowl and put a brownie on the bottom and then put ice cream on top of it. The. Sprinkle it with toppings and enjoy.   If you like salads I would recommend you check this place out.",

Sweet Service:  If someone is by the front door you're immediately greeted.  The crew does a great job of keeping the salad area clean and clear.  This is very impressive to me as people can get very messy when serving themselves.  All the stations hot food stations are always stocked.  If a particular item is empty, you don't have to wait long it to be replenished.    Sweet Food:  The huge salad line always sports fresh veggies to build your power salad.  I've never had a bad experience. The soups are always savory and you'll always cash me ousside by the mac 'n cheese bowl numerous times...how bout dat?  I love how the pizzas cut into tiny pieces as it helps with my portion control.  You seat yourself and the staff does it best to clear the tables.  This might be the one area they need to work on but I've never had a real issue.  This is a popular location because the value offered is great and employees are very friendly.  I'm one of many regulars at this location and is a great place to get your salad on! Enjoy...=)",

The salad bar is filled with a plethora of healthy options and those not so but so delicious! When you use your Yelp check in offer you even receive 15% off your bill. One of my favorite drinks is their bottomless strawberry lemonade and they offer Pepsi products now.  Once inside we locate a booth near the hot foods as we will make numerous trips to fill up soup bowls, try the few pasta options and of course enjoy the warm cornbread  with sweet butter and the muffins oh my! Whoops had to wipe my mouth, started drooling thinking of the warm goodness. The pizza and bread is good but is too filling so make sure to limit your self. Mac and cheese with chili flakes is always solid as is the penne pasta. A new one was the greek capatavi pasta, very capery and yet addicting.  I like the clever cards on each table letting the workers know \"I'll be Ripe back\" or the \"See you next Thyme!\" Makes us smile every time we eat.   This trip they offered a coconut muffin that was so moist and good i had to go back fro seconds. The have baked potatoes and sweet potato if you choose. Make sure you check the soups as their are often seasonal favorites included. This trip they offered french onion, the delicious big chunk chicken noodle soup, deep kettle house chili, veggie hot and sour, turbo kale and veggie soup, cream of mushroom soup, yankee clipper clam chowder with bacon and sante fe black bean chili. Our favorites this trip were the veggie hot and sour and the big chunk chicken noodle. There is fruit for after your meal or the creamy soft serve machine with vanilla, chocolate and swirl combining both. Don't forget the toppings to make it your own custom dessert.   Enjoy the pics of our adventure in filling our bellies and come and try for yourself!",

I got a full salad, pasta, garlic bread and ice cream for dessert. The salad was absolutely delicious and I almost filled up from just that. The Alfredo pasta was a little too peppery for me but I still ate it. The garlic bread was good with the pasta and I saved room for dessert. I will be returning!",

The smell will for sure tempt you to proceed forward into this restaurant.      There's a salad bar at the very front of this restaurant when you walk in. Grab a tray and a plate, and pick out as much food as you want from there. But don't load up on the salad! There's still more scrumptious food waiting in the buffet section!      After you pay and find your seat, head straight to the buffet area. There, you will find a fruit, gelatin snack, and pudding section. I recommend getting the raspberry gelatin snack cubes.       Continue to the soup area which has a huge variety of soups. My personal favorites are the turkey chili soup, and the chicken noodle soup. You still can't go wrong if you don't get those!      As you start heading over to the rest of the buffet area, you will see a baked potato section, and a pasta section. For me, personally, I like to go with the macaroni and cheese, then head over to the baked potato area to get bacon for it.      Now you have completed your main course (with some room for dessert), you can now enjoy the two dessert areas.  There is the baked goods area, and the ice cream area. I will always get either the chocolate lava cake, or the carrot cake! Why? They are both so delicious. During winter, they have gingerbread ice cream, which in my opinion, is the best ice cream flavor I have ever had. They also have a topping section, and cone dispenser.       What else is to love about this place? The free cookies and cookie bars. Around dinnertime, they serve you fresh, hot, chocolate chip cookies. They pretty much melt in your mouth.     This is my absolute favorite go-to buffet place around!",

My brother-in-law has a medical condition that prevents him from consuming a lot of food in one sitting.  He purchased a to-go salad but was not allowed to sit with the group inside the restaurant without purchasing an additional meal.  Previously he was allowed to do this so I am not sure what changed.  When we are having a family meal we will need to select a different restaurant.",

However, I'm not sure if it's just a one time thing, but there is ALOT of eggshells in the boiled eggs I added to my salad, and they tasted like they had been in the fridge for a longgg time. Also, being a vegetarian, I was looking forward to the mushroom soup, however, it was cooked in Chicken Broth.   The value is really good though, and I really wanted to like the place. I might try again another day and update my review!",

    "text": "One of my favorite lunch spots! I absolutely love that I walk in and can make a salad completely to my liking. The toppings seem almost endless, and if your plate doesn't look like a small mountain, you're probably doing it wrong. They also have prepared salads which never seem to disappoint. The wonton madness is my fave! They also have a few pasta salads, a potato salad, slaws, and other treats towards the end of the salad bar. Another thing I like is that as the seasons change, so do the salads and other food they have available. Moving on... the soup bar. Wow. They have some really amazing soups. The chili is superb! Add some cheese and a dollop of sour cream and yummmmm! They also have cheesy breads which they have a fancy name for - I just can't remember it at the moment. They have freshly baked muffins and brownies, 3 different freshly made pastas, anddddd a dessert bar featuring puddings, mousse, fruit and more. And wait for it... a soft serve icecream machine withhhhh a topping bar. You really get a bang out of your buck here. I always leave feeling like I got my money's worth ( and like I'm 9 months pregnant with a food baby) . If you're looking for a tasty spot for a healthy, get delicious lunch/dinner. This is it! They also have to go options- which I've never utilized, but always see them available. Staff is always super nice and pleasant too which always makes the experience more enjoyable.",

They always have a vegetarian/vegan option.  2 stars- Plenty of unhealthy options to bulk up your calorie count to make you feel like you are eating healthy when you really have consumed more calories than a super size fast food hamburger combo.  Too many creamy soup options. More calories.  Pizza. I get it, it's for the kids. Kids literally running around without parental supervision... there are other diners in the restaurant... it is not your home... control your kids or maybe teach then some manners. To the parent of the kid that crashed into my elderly father while he was carrying his tray of food - shame on you. Take your kid to the park to play.

The restaurant floors were dirty along with multiple tables not being cleaned. Once I visited the buffet area, the plates were dirty. I waited for the fresh batch of mac n cheese just to find a black hair mixed in with it. Which would make sense because no one wears hair nets in the kitchen. The ones handling the food are in management. Which you would think, they would know better. I immediately stopped eating. I informed someone of the hair, and they made a new batch and offered to get us a new plate. NO!!! I don't want a new plate. I wanted to get the hell out of there. I informed management that they should start enforcing hair nets. Needless to say, I left hungry and will not be returning to any Sweet tomato ever again.",

The restaurant was not overly busy and no wait for using the john, so it's not like it was overused. My advice to the owner - raise the price per plate by 50 cents and upgrade the outhouse (restroom) - the men's is disgusting. I don't go to restaurants that have outhouses for bathrooms and will certainly not recommend this one.",

They have a hot section next to the mega salad bar which consists of soups, baked potatoes, breads, pastas, and a sundae bar.  Like I mentioned earlier I wasn't really hungry and the placed had a weird old dish towel smell. Everyone was attacking the food bars like they had never eaten in there life!

They have muffins, breads, pastas, and soups as well as all the salad and veggies one can eat.  I love the cornbread  because it has corn kernals baked into it.  I like to go with a two plate tray to start out.  I probably eat about four plates of salad every time I go.  Not always a big fan of the soups.  Two out of the eight or so usually catch my eye.  They have rotating desserts every month along with specialty soups and salads that go along with the monthly theme.  Sign up for the Club Veg and you get coupons every couple of weeks or so for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  If you're lucky they come around with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.  The staff is always friendly and they are quick to clean up your used plates/trays.",

To top off the meal I usually go for the vanilla Ice Cream, however I top it off with some of their butterscotch caramel and then finish that off with some honey that they keep where the drink area is at... it's simply delicious!!!",

    "text": "This Sweet Tomatoes has a leg up on the competition because they serve cream of mushroom soup. Anybody that eats at Sweet Tomatoes knows that they cater to the geriatric crowd by not seasoning or salting any of their soups (or pastas) so I was surprised they had a decent soup at this location (it still needed salt and pepper though, but that's a given.)   This location also is better than others because they serve TWO types of pickled beets on their salad bar, LOVE!  I piled up two plates my FIRST go around with the Asian Chicken Salad and another with spinach, romaine, pickled beets, butternut squash, broccoli salad, black olives, carrots, hard boiled eggs, raisins, sunflower seeds, cheddar and ranch - I love that you can get all those toppings at this salad bar instead of your basic iceberg, ranch, cheese, croutons that are offered at other places.   I thought it was cute how they had little factoids above certain items which was interesting. I'm sure they're more entertaining if you're waiting in a huge line but luckily, since we went there at 8, it was pretty empty.  I picked the cherries out of a muffin to eat and they were excessively sour, so I'd avoid the cherry muffins next time.  For my sister and me to eat, both with tap waters, it came out to about $21. That's pricey for what we ate, could probably make it cheaper at home, but it's cheaper than a buffet on the strip.",

The ladles and handles to serve food were also caked in liquid (be it salad dressing, soup, or pasta sauce), and the floor was covered with food particles.  The only saving grace for this location was the prompt response of the manager, who responded to a complaint that I filed on the Sweet Tomatoes website.",

    "text": "As many times as I've made the trip to Sweet Tomatoes I always leave there with the same thing to say about it.. so I thought I'd share those thoughts with everyone for a change! (exciting, right?)   Grab your lunch room tray, a plastic plate and lets get the party started! Your first (usually) 3 options are mushy pre-dressed \"theme\" salads, great for the folks lacking imagination in putting together their own salad from scratch. Then on to the salad troff's..   Three types of lettuce to choose from, just about every veggie you can think of, along with a decent spread of additional salad toppings and dressings to choose from; the sky is the limit (or the sneeze guard for that matter) when it comes to piling on a massive salad creation.   Next you'll grab your lunch room plastic cup, pay and proceed to the drink station. Depending on the day of the week, you may get to choose your own seat (yey!) or a host/ess will seat you.   My experience last night consisted of more children than adults (it felt like it at least) and the smell of dirty feet and a mild side of locker room over powered the aroma of the soups and hot foods out on display.   As much as I enjoy a good salad and a hearty (or several) bowls of soup along with mac and cheese and the frozen yogurt bar, I hardly feel the experience is worth the $13 I paid to dine there. The concept is great but it's hard to enjoy yourself when you're tripping over toddlers, waiting on zitty teenagers to hand pick each individual mac and cheese noodle.. and getting past the locker room smell was just a bit much for me last night.   All in all, if you have a coupon, if it's not a weekend night, fine, go for it, but other than that, save yourself the special trip unless you absolutely MUST have some of their amazing (and only redeeming part of this venue) chicken noodle soup. :)   Oh, yeah! The service is always great, that's another saving grace.",

Little did i know i'd end up loving this place.   I appreciate the fact that they have different flavors every month, so it's not the same ol' same ol'. Also, i get tired of tastes quickly, so I like that I can get a small plate or bowl and go get something different.   OH and btw, they are CHEAP! For only $7-$8 a person, i have to say, that's the best priced buffet to fill up on!

Here instead of the all-you-can-eat buffet you simply point and tell the employee there what you'd like on your salad. The salads are big too so you'll get your money's worth.  It's very quick and they'll add as much of whatever ingredient as you like. Once your salad is built you have the option of adding a cup of soup or a muffin. I believe there were 5 different types of soups. I tried the Sweet Potato & Chorizo.. it was awesome!  The prices are fair, salad alone is $6.99 or $8.99 with soup.  The location alone will definitely get me to come back. It's very clean and the employees are friendly. Plus there's not blue cheese dressing sloshed in the other dressings like usual at the buffet locations.",

You truly can't complain about this place unless you made your own salad concoction and have no idea what you put in it.

It is a buffet, so feel free to grab a tray with usually one or two plates. The have premade salads (sometimes soggy but premixed for you, my preference) or build your own salad. They also have a ton of toppings and side salads, which I really like the tuna pasta salad and the broccoli salad.   After you pay, you seat yourself here. It was very busy the night that we went, but we were able to find a table pretty easily. They have a large variety of soups, 3 pastas, 2 flatbread/pizzas, different baked quick breads, baked potatoes, and simple fruit & frozen yogurt selection.

(We arrived right at noon and the place was filling pretty rapidly)  The parking was tight and several people seemed to be looking for a place to park.  This was my first visit to Sweet Tomatoes.  As you enter, there are trays and plates to grab and to go cups for soup (to go).  There was a counter with 2 isles with a variety of lettuce and salads  and a large variety of toppings to choose from.  After you pay, there is also a soup station with several different soups, muffins, (my guest commented several times how good the blue berry muffins were), brownies, pasta, and there was a lady cooking what looked like sauces (which I did not try).  There is a self serve fountain drink station and a self serve ice cream station.  I had bottled water to drink and my guest had coffee.  The bill was $27.00.  (The amount was paid after my salad choices were made and before any soup or dessert choices were made)  I thought this was a little high as most reviews were in the $10 range (per person), but you can have all you want of what is offered, so if you're really hungry, I guess it's worth it.  I was just thinking that $18 to $20 would be more in the price range. I would recommend giving this place a try as we enjoyed the eating experience.",

We signed up for their e-mail program and we get awesome coupons.  If you have a smart phone you can just pull them up on your phone and the cashier can scan them.  You don't have to print them out. In 2013 we used to get coupons all the time for \"2 for 1\" but it seems like they stopped making those. It was a fantastic deal.   We find coupons in the junk coupon books that are shoved in our mailbox once a week, too.   Everything is always fresh and it's usually busy there and I've never had a rude or weird employee.  They refill everything before it's even low.  This place is doing it right.",

    "text": "March 6, 2016 2:30pm. 2 people for a late lunch  Ambiance: 3 stars* Food: 5 stars Service: always with a smile & Thank You! 5 stars!  First, I have to say that when I lived in Henderson, we would go here for lunch or dinner at least once a week! A healthier alternative of a buffet style salad bar with fresh made soups and pastas, and you can't beat the price!  Ambiance: When you walk in, a full salad bar is laid out for you ingredient by ingredient. You pick up a tray and a plate, and you start adding as much or as little of everything as you like. Everything is fresh! Nothing frozen here! Anywhere from six to eight kinds of dressing for the salad, as well as toppers galore! You are asked what you would like to drink, I highly recommend the fresh made strawberry lemonade. It's amazing! You're given your cup and you seat yourself in a style that looks similar to a Denny's, but don't be off by the ambiance! It's well worth it for the food! Also, the employees work their butts off to bus tables full of piles and piles of dishes; so if you go there, please leave them a tip, as they've worked so hard for it!  Food:  With every kind of lettuce and salad mix you can imagine, you make your way down a long aisle that is full of toppers from red kidney beans, to pasta salads, julienned carrots and zucchini, etc! Even stuff you never thought of putting on a salad, they have available! It's amazing!   You then make your way to the soup bar, with about 6 soups made fresh throughout the day. There is something for every taste and palate. You have your choice of baked potatoes, various different breads, and multiple pasta dishes as well!  To top it off, if you've not stuffed yourself to the gills, they have a frozen yogurt machine with any kind of topping you can imagine, including hot fudge or hot caramel sauce to go on top of it!  My husband and I went in for lunch today, and paid $9.99 each to stuff ourselves with something that was a healthier alternative to most buffets here in Vegas or Henderson. I feel good about my choices when I go here!  I hope someday soon Reno will have their very own Sweet Tomatoes!",

Born and raised in So Cal, this place is known as Souplantation. I still prefer to call it Souplantation anyways. It just makes more sense!!! =) So it's basically a salad bar buffet. There's also 7 soups to choose from, your pizza, muffins, baked potatoes and 3 pasta dishes. Soups and pastas can vary. It changes each month.  I don't know how healthy this really is. Personally, I would like to think it's healthy for me. It sure beats the heck outta burgers, fries and tacos right?? The food here is pretty good...it helps you get your veggies and salad fix. Boyfriend and I always come here with their coupons from the weekly mailers. 2 adult lunches run about $20. Sometimes they have coupons were a drink is included.",

Back when I used to live in the Bay Area at those locations as well as here in Vegas, this was the spot my family would always go to. In Henderson, the one on Stephanie is the one we head to.   Just recently they've remodeled their restaurant, and now it has a cleaner, farm to table type look rather than a cafe zupas red plate type look. (Which is not bad at all!)   -Step one: Get a tray and plate. Then choose ether side of the salad buffet and fill that plate with whatever salad/topping you like!  -Step two: once you get down the buffet aisle, you pay for your meal.  -Step three: depending on how busy they are, you are allowed to find your own table, OR someone will be there to direct you to a table suitable for the amount of people in your party.  -Step 4: sit down, eat, and head over to the soup station/bakery/dessert counter/ETC. any time to feast on those items :)   **TIP: they have cards at your table that will say something along the lines of \"be right back\" or \"I'm finished\" in a cute clever pun. Leave whichever side up depending on if you're just heading to the buffet again or leaving for good so they know whether or not to clean up the rest of your mess!",

    "text": "After grueling day of work, I needed food fast. I didn't have time to wait and so my goal was to find a nearby buffet with moderately healthy food? What's healthier than raw salad? I can't think of anything...  So after convincing my husband, we arrive at the Sweet Tomatoes confused as can be. I see a check-in special offering 15% off, which was an added bonus to attending a nearly meatless restaurant. I walk in on the entrance by the salad bar, unsure of what to do next. A few minutes later an employee says I can just grab a plate and create a salad and then I can go pay at the cash register at the end of the salad bar.  After the employee gives his spiel, a customer helping himself to buffet seconds chimes in. He said \"Oh this place is great; you can keep coming back as much as you want. There is even pizza, soups, and desert in the back.\" By pizza, he meant focaccia bread, but it's all the same to me.    After the introduction, I grab a plate. Actually I grab about 5 plates before I find one clean enough for me to feel comfortable eating off of. My husband got lucky and got a clean one his first try.  We each grab one plate and fill it to our hearts content. Beats, broccoli, corn, quinoa, premade salads, nuts, and cheese all make a place on my plate. The ingredients looked fresh and this was one of the first times I was excited to eat a salad. I get to the cash register to pay and tell the cashier about the check-in special. To my disappointment, she reveals that the coupon is fake and unauthorized by the company. However, she gave me a 10% senior's discount, which was way cool.  After munching down my first incredible customized salad, I needed to go explore the other options. That's when I got 3 soups, 3 amazing soups jam packed with flavor. Sirracha Carrot was tasty pureed carrots with the right amount of heat. Potato and Leak was kept simple, just like it was meant to be. My favorite soup, Albondigas Locas, has got me committed to coming back. This soup was tangy as if it has lemon in it, with rice and chicken meatballs.   As I write this review, I cannot help but salivate. After completing my soup sampling, I was full. I didn't feel like I needed to keep going back for more to get my money's worth because dinner was only $11.99 + tax (minus my discount).  So I passed on their cookie bar dessert and self-serve ice-cream.   The next day, I decided to hop online and join Club Veg (their official rewards program). Next time I use a discount, it will be the correct one. FYI valid discount codes will all begin with a W.",

    "text": "OK. So it's exactly like Souplantation but it's called something different. Luckily and most importantly, you can use your Souplantation coupons here too. I had the 9.59 dinner coupon so the meal for two of us was around $21. So it's exactly the same as Souplantation with the salad first and then you have your bakery and soup stations. I must say though that the food tasted better. The salad was pretty decent but I think the biggest difference came from the soup and the pasta. The soup was very unique because of the holiday season but the staples like the Chicken Noodle Soup tasted better. I also enjoyed the unique soups like the posole. As for the pasta, I remember the days when Souplantation used to make your pasta to order but now that those days are over, it is good to see them actually cook the pasta dishes. I loved the mac and cheese with the overload of cheese flavor! It's more like a cheese soup with macaroni but I'm not complaining about that. Might be in my head but I honestly felt the food tasted better and the place was more organized. Also, there was not wait so we got to seat ourselves and not the deal with the crowds.  A general tip with Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes, remember to look at all your \"clean\" plates and bowls. I don't blame them with all the turnover but just check to see they are actually clean. Most of the time, I have to pick and choose the bowls I use to get soup. :\\",

The salad bar is your first stop before paying.  Several pre-made salads are available if you don't want to build one.  The toppings are abundant in a clean buffet area.  After paying you can then visit the soup/pasta/bread area.  The specialties change from month to month depending on what is in season.  Leave room for dessert as well! Ice cream, pudding and dessert breads are there for your enjoyment!   If you sign up on their email list, you can get pretty good coupons.  Otherwise just look one up on your phone before heading in.  They are more than happy to scan a coupon from your phone.    As far as buffets go, I don't feel as guilty for eating at this one.",

    "text": "I love this place! Yes I know, I can chop up my own vegetables at home for a lot cheaper. But honestly, who wants to do that after a long day at work?  Here's the run down. You pile your salad with all the accoutrement. You pay for your food. Then you head towards all the hot food. All of which is delicious.   They have tons of options when it comes to customizing your salad. Along with all the toppings, they have every dressing under the sun. I personally love the ranch, but I just limit myself to one little paper cup instead of drenching my whole salad so I can control my calorie intake. Because what's the point of salad if you're just going to drench it in cheese, dressing and croutons?   As for the hot food, they have a large variety of soups including your basic chicken noodle. They also have baked potatoes, focaccia breads and pastas. And if you're not already full, they have dessert! For the health nuts, there's fruit and jello. If you want something more indulgent, there is frozen yogurt with the option of sprinkles, nuts and various sauces.   This place is all about options! Something to keep in mind though, just because you're eating a salad, doesn't mean you're eating healthy. Watch what you put on it. And that's my public announcement for the day.",

The salad bar was filthy dressings all mixed and all over the bar, the 3 salads they had were close to empty with no one making new salad, the lettuce was old and it wasn't even close to the closing time. The soups looked old as well... I used to love this place but we will not be back.",

The potato bar area was a mess with cheese and green onion in the sour cream, the chili was luke warm and the food overall was mediocre. When we went to sit down there were maybe 3 clean tables in the whole restaurant. I thought since we came in at 1pm that we may have just missed the lunch crowd, but only a handful got cleaned off by the time we were finished with our meal. Hate to leave a bad review about a place I have enjoyed eating at. However, we will not be back.",

    "text": "Last night my daughter and I went to Sweet Tomatoes on Stephanie to have dinner..We sat down and started to eat. My daughter got up to grab a baked potato, cheese and green onion. On her way back she dropped her cheese and green onion on the floor. Paul the Manager stood right next to my daughter and watched her get on the floor to pick up the items. While the Manager stood next to my daughter talking to someone at a table another employee walked past my daughter. I immediately lost my appetite seeing this type of action from not only 1 employee but 2, one of them being a Manager. Neither one voiced that assistance was called and neither one voiced that it was being taken cared of. Neither employee gave my daughter the chance to say no it's okay it's my fault I can take care of it. The Manager himself just stood and watched.  When I went up to the front counter to speak to a manager or supervisor that is when I found out Paul the person watching my daughter clean something off the floor was the actual manager. It then took a while for Paul to come up to the counter. When voicing my concern he didn't seem that concerned about his and his employees actions. Paul seemed to have a lot of communication with someone sitting at the table next to us versus being a Manager and dealing with situations that arise in the restaurant that he is managing.   I have been to this location numerous times and this time I felt that the customer service has gone down hill which is sad because I liked coming to this location.",

Because by the time I'm at the end of the salad line, my plate probably has more calories than a double cheeseburger. It just feels healthier? Anyway. The salad ingredients are always fresh tasting and yummy.   I always sit down and eat my not-so-healthy salad before heading to the soup/pasta section. This area reminds me more of like Cici's pizza quality. The soups are good enough, but usually pretty bland. A little salt and pepper definitely adds flavor..   The breads and pastas are also so so.. Nothing to get super excited over. That being said, I think it's a little pricey to just go for an amazing salad, but then again we've all been complaining for quite some time how a Big Mac is cheaper than a salad, and soda is cheaper than water. Something completely backwards about good ol' 'Murrica.",

I've been to the one in Atlanta years ago and loved it.   ATMOSPHERE: Casual. Laid back buffet style. No wait at all when we went during the week at lunch time. Clean and plenty of places to sit.   MENU: Two sides of self service salad bar as you first walk in. Variety of fresh salads, pasta and toppings. My favorite is the strawberry fields salad but I also love creating my own salad.  The next room offers soups, bake goods and dessert. My favorite was the coconut muffin. It was so moist,  melt in your mouth and beyond delicious. The key to the recipe was all fresh ingredients. There is also a self service drink island in the middle of the restaurant with enough choices to quench everyone's thirst. They offer teas, coffee, sodas, lemonade. If you're in the mood for soup and salad, this is the place to hit.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Excellent. The staff was very nice. The manager was awesome and we had a chance to chat with him briefly.",

    "text": "Ah, where to begin? I come here at least three times a month, if not more. I usually come with family or friends sometime between lunch and dinner. It's always crowded, but I don't mind because the food is great! Sweet Tomatoes may be known as a salad bar, but it's definitely a place that has something for everyone, even if you're not really into that whole vegetable thing.  Sweet Tomatoes is completely buffet style. You grab a plate when you enter, choose your greens (or not), throw some toppings on it, dress it up, and pay at the register! But please, do yourself a favor and do not pass up the Tuna Tarragon pasta! I'm not even a fan of tuna, but this housemade pasta is one of my favorites! It's creamy and so flavorful!   Besides the AYCE salad bar, Sweet Tomatoes offers other options, many of which are also gluten-free and/or vegetarian. There really is something for everyone! They have a variety of soups that are always changing, depending on what they are currently featuring or what is in season. Lucky for me, the Deep Kettle House Chili and Big Chunk Chicken Noodle Soup remain a staple all year long. A favorite amongst everyone is the bakery portion of the buffet. The Focaccia breads and muffins are baked fresh daily. All are delicious! What carbs aren't though? One of my favorites is definitely the Buttermilk Corn Bread! There are real pieces of corn in the bread which is a nice touch. I suggest the Honey Whip spread for any bread or muffin. Please do not forget the Honey Whip! Do I need to say it louder for the people in the back? You will regret it. If you have room leftover by the time you're done devouring your customized salad, there is a soft-serve yogurt machine with miniature cones and toppings! Yes, there is hot fudge. As far as beverages go, they offer the usual Coca Cola products, milk, hot coffee, and oh my gosh, everyone needs to try the Strawberry Lemonade! The best strawberry lemonade I've ever tasted! The Arnold Palmer is quite refreshing as well.  Sweet Tomatoes has a rewards program called Club Veg. If you frequent this restaurant, I suggest you sign up because they constantly send out coupons with good deals and keep you informed of what the current menu is featuring! Also, a 15% off check-in special is offered for lunch and dinner... Winning!",

Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....  If you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.  Toss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here.   Oh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs.",

Now, I'm a total meat lover and never been really big on salads, so I'm a little biased in my review.  The salad bar was okay. I tried the Asian wonton salad, which tasted pretty good. I also made a mini salad of my own. The ingredients looked pretty fresh, which I find impressive since it was only an hour before closing time. The soups I tried were pretty tasty; corn chowder and a chicken casserole inspired one. I also had the mac & cheese and penne in marinara, both of which were alright. The focaccia bread was okay. Too many burnt toppings. The soft serve/froyo was delicious.  Overall, I can't complain too much about the quality of the food. I'm not so happy about the price, though. Buffet pricing for greens and soup? I'd much rather spend the same amount of something with more protein. I wouldn't mind going again, but I'll probably look for coupons and it won't be a regular thing.",

There wasn't any meat in any of the pasta (tiny meatballs in one of the pasta that was all scooped up by others). I tried the clam chowder soup and it was good. The chicken noodles soup was bland and the noodle was kinda too al dente, don't see what is the hype about the chicken noodles soup. The chili was just thick and not that tasty, I feel that the chili from Wendy's is better. There are a bunch of different toppings for the salad and a variety of salads. I got the blu cheese dressing and it is too tart. I am not that impressed with sweet tomato.

Anyway, the salad was great. There was an Asian salad that was amazing!  The soups were good, but nothing fabulous.  I really LOVED the dark bread with honey whipped butter, yum O!    The pasta was a little bland, but decent.  Disappointed that they had run out of baked potatoes and hadn't even put any in the oven.    For dessert, skip the ice cream and try the fresh strawberries with whipped cream and chopped almond granola from the ice cream bar.  YUM!",

Sadly it only looks great because the cleanliness of the restaurant has really suffered. First off trying to get a clean plate is almost impossible. I litterally checked 10 plates before i got a clean one, the beverage cups have food stuck to them and smudge marks all over. We even had to  clean off the forks. Unbelievable!  I let one of the workers know about the plates, she didnt seem surprised and  her response was that the dishwasher just doesn't wash them that good. Needless to say we are never going back to this location.",

If you get a bunch of salad and veggies you can get out of here with a very healthy meal, or go nuts on everything and have a delicious feast.

Salad bar with pre-tossed salads and DIY salads, various soup choices to your liking, baked potatoes with condiments, breads, muffins, pastas (most if not all taste bland, I would say avoid them unless you pour mounds of soup or something on top of them), a few fruit choices, and dessert. For the most part, this restaurant is vegetarian; so, if you're feelin like grubbin, I suggest you go somewhere else.  You can always find coupons for this venue online, and they accept coupons presented on the phone (no need for print-outs).  This specific locale is nothing more, nothing less than others, besides the fact that they no longer serve Clam Chowder. Average cleanliness, pleasant staff, and nothing out-of-the-ordinary that has stuck out the various times I've dined here.",

My friends and I were weaning away from eating the regular Strip buffets, so we settled on one that was a lot more healthy. The salads, the foccacia bread, the soups...all delicious! I especially love their asian chicken salad and their broccoli salad. If you're a big muffin person, you have to eat their muffins with their apple butter! It's so good!   Don't feel bad when you eat here! A lot of their food items are low in fat. If you want to eat at a buffet, you can eat a little bit more healthy and save more money at Sweet Tomatoes (costs about $8.50 for the buffet with a drink). I'd eat at Sweet Tomatoes any day.",

You start off with a great salad bar, holy heck it has everything you need and want.  I can not even list what they have...I know there is lettuce.   After the salad I normally stroll over to the soups. I normally try 2 soups. Definitely have the chili, it is delicious.  Grad some breads, last time they had \"grilled cheese\" focaccia and a garlic focaccia.  The corn bread is a nice side dish for the chili.  I tend to skip the pasta so I can not comment on that.  I am more than happy with the salad, soup, and desert.  After the mound of salad, bowls or soups, and piles of bread (carb overload) it is time for ice cream. They do have fruit and pudding as well.  But, you can not end without taking the chocolate brownie (last visit they had PB/Choc bars) and covering it with your favorite soft serve ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or swirl).  Add some toppings and it is time to indulge.  Pass the salad fork!",

    "text": "I'm tempted to give this place 5 stars because Sweet Tomatoes has turned me into a salad person.  I have always said 'I don't like salads.'  Sweet Tomatoes, heretofore known as ST, has turned me onto the green leafy goodness that is so versatile!  I'm a fan of ST's Wonton Chicken Salad (I think that's the one).  I don't know what it is about this fixed salad that makes me crave it for days--weeks even--after I've last eaten there.  I'm convinced it's the seasoning.   I experienced said deliciousness by accident:  the first time I was taken to eat at ST, the guy in line ahead of me filled his entire plate, and left enough of a serving for me (he seemed to feel bad to empty the entire bowl on the bar).  Observing his pillage, I tried what remained of the Wonton Chicken Salad and have been hooked since!  In hindsight, that dude knew exactly what he was doing!    To back up a moment, you walk into ST and immediately sanitize your hands.  At least you should as two sanitization stations are located on each end of the salad bar line.  Cleanliness is part of ST's company culture and it's not going to kill you.  You get a tray and proceed down the salad bar line.  There's the usual salad fixing fare plus the fancier stuff so don't stop at just my suggestion.  You can always go back for more.  ST offers the usual iced or hot teas, sodas and coffee, but definitely try the strawberry lemonade.  Just do it; don't question.  It pairs quite nicely with my fixed salad of choice.  Two adults can eat dinner there for about $26.00.  For a healthy buffet plus soup bar and bakery, plus drink refills, you're getting a pretty good price.    As you pay and exit the salad bar, you choose where you sit.  The atmosphere is warm and family-friendly.  The decor is soft colors:  oranges, reds and greens.  I feel cozy in there.  There are servers who--bless them--bring around chocolate chip cookies for each patron.  You can buy those same cookies pre-packaged for two bucks or less at 13 cookies, but if you think about it, you can make your own for that same price if you pick up the ingredients at Wal-Mart.  Still, it's awfully cozy having someone bring you chocolate chip cookies.    The soup bar is in the back near the bakery and ice cream station.  I love the tomato basil bisque but to my disappointment, that item is only served in the fall.  There are 10 or so other options so there's not a lot of room for disappointment.  Currently, ST is serving this chocolate lava cake which is shockingly not too sweet or overly filling because it's more of a muffin than cake.  I seriously doubt its sugar-free but I believe some of ST's options are more in line with a diabetic's diet.  No matter how full I am, I always squeeze in a blueberry muffin.  They're warm no matter what time I go and perfectly blueberry-sweetened.  In addition to the sweeter items, there are soft bread sticks, wheat biscuits, and other bread & bakery fare choices.  I can't imagine anyone being entirely disappointed with the offerings even though the menu varies a little day to day and season by season.  Nothing wrong with spicing things up a bit, in my opinion.    Leave a tip for the server if you're so inclined or deserving of it (i.e.picked up your empty plates and dishes and brought you cookies).  If time is an issue, you can also take out from ST and I believe they serve family style take-out as well.  ST is a great place to eat healthy, stay in budget, and feel good about what you've eaten without walking away feeling unsatisfied.",

I will say that the person managing our table was more than attentive and returned often to offer refills. That's pretty cool.  While everything is fresh and tasty, there is one thing that irritates me a little about this place. I don't like the way they cut up their veggies. Almost everything is julienne or match stick and I don't always like the way that feels. I would rather the salad appear that it was prepared just for me. It would make me feel a little better about $12.00. That's about what it is with a drink.",

    "text": "I LOVE this place!  I miss the days when nobody knew about it because the wait is long, the food is not replenished in an efficient manner, and it is over crowded.  The coupons bring in an undesirable crowd, dressing like they just rolled up into Walmart.  I'm obsessed with the food!  I love the salad line.  I visit so often I think I've memorized where all of the food is on the buffet line.  I love making my own salad.  I also like the fact that there are featured foods throughout the year.  Tons of toppings for your salad and pre-made salad options.  There are seasonal slaws and macaroni style salads.  My favorite is the pineapple coconut cole slaw.  There are vegetarian, vegan, and meat lover options. There are tons of drink choices from tea, lemonade, sodas, coffee, and milk.  There are fruit options, delicious soups, baked potatoes, breads, muffins, pastas, and plenty of toppings for all of these.  Choose your poison on the butters, since they have plenty to chose from.  To end the day, enjoy yogurt/ice cream with all the yummy toppings like cookie crumbles, chocolate syrup, caramel sauce, sprinkles, and nuts in a small cone or bowl.  If you visit for dinner, try their dessert of the day.  One of my favorites is the brownie crumbled over ice cream.  If you are lucky you will get a homemade fresh cookie brought over to your table.  Google coupons!  There are killer deals.  Join there club online to get coupons sent directly to your inbox.  My advice is to arrive early or late, visit during the non-rush times.  Weekends can be extremely busy, so avoid at all costs.  If you go during busy times you may feel like the buffet line is dirty, not replenished, and you have to wait several minutes to be seated in an undesirable seat.  There are people who clear your plates off of the table.  That is a hit or miss type of service.  I've been there when the people are on top of their \"A\" game and are clearing tables quickly and I've been there when I didn't see anyone clearing tables during the time that I ate my meal.",

They also have an extensive varieties of soups.  They have bread, pastries, soft serve ice cream, fruits, and pasta.  Also, after 4pm, they serve a special dessert just for dinner.

The last time I went there was an evil little kid sitting behind me in the next booth that would not quit kicking me.  Word to the wise...DO NOT SEAT PEOPLE WITHOUT KIDS NEXT TO KIDS!!!!!  SERIOUSLY!  It ruins a dinning experience even if you are used to them (even if you have them!  If you left them at home there is probably a reason!).  This has always been my biggest pet peeve.  We finally got babies out of movie theaters now we need to work on family seating!  Not that it matters much in this place, because sound carries so well that it should be an auditorium, not a restaurant.  The food, I've never been able to complain about, though you may have to wait if it's a popular menu item, cooks can only go so fast and it's literally a free-for-all some days.  So, my vote is if you have a picky eater, go here, if you have a snobby eater, avoid!",

Initially, parking, if you do not show up at 10:30, parking is limited until the afternoon lull.  We have noticed the employees are taking the \"premium\" front spots.  Today and our last visit, two front spots were taken by employees (we know this since we saw the manager let them in the building).  Today, the doors opened promptly at 11:00,only to be delayed at the counter since none of the salads were not prepared.  We waited and decided to press on after only the Won Ton Happiness was prepared.  After paying, the cashier apologized since she did not receive a scoop for the ice and told us to go the soda dispenser.  I went to the drink station and  discovered the drip tray under the drink dispenser was already full of liquid (minutes after opening?).  We had to wait for the employees to put ladles in the soup since they were still measuring the temperature.  After dining, we decided to have some ice cream only to the machine \"burb out\" a large amount of ice cream.  Obviously, the machine was not tested prior to opening.   This could have made a horrible mess on someone.    Summing up 1.  Employees should not take front spots. 2.  Everything should be ready, cleaned, and tested prior to opening.  Las Vegas has plenty of buffets (for a lot less money) and get protein (aka meat) for a lot less money.  To be competitive, you need to outshine the competition.",

    "text": "This place is good when you want to get a salad made your way and some other healthy choices. The service is pretty good and I personally enjoy the drink selections.. The pomegranate green tea is amazing. It is slightly like the chain fresh choice in northern California except sweet tomato has fewer choices. There is not a lot that can be said about this place, you serve yourself and they clear your table. So far... good job.",

    "text": "We went here for lunch one day. We were surprised at how busy it was. It's pretty much an all you can eat salad bar. They have a bunch of options for veggies which were all very fresh. Different cheeses, lots is dressing, so many toppings. They also have a hot area,  in which they serve soup, pasta, baked potatoes, mac and cheese, bread and ice cream. The salad area was exceptionally clean,  however the hot area needed some attention. There was a lot of food that was just everywhere. The soups were kind of out there, I think it would be better to offer basic or classic soups like chicken noodle or clam chowder etc. The only reason why I won't return is because they don't offer any protein for your salad! No chicken, tuna or even tofu? If it's about price then do an upcharge for it. Without some kind of protein, there's really not a ton of nutritional value. Your pretty much eating water which is pointless unless your a vegetarian. Other than that,  service was great. People constantly walking around trying to pick up dirty plates. plates Lots of families with little kids",

    "text": "I have eaten here several times, and overall, I have had good experiences.  I am a huge fan of their specialty salad, Wonton Chicken Happiness.  I also love their Big Chunk Chicken Noodle Soup (although today it was a little bland). I have found that their selection of both salad greens and toppings as well as pastas, soups, and baked goods are \"souperior\" to other similar establishments like Souper Salad. Sweet Tomatoes is a little more spendy, but I think this is a good example of when you get what you pay for. I initially gave them 4 stars, but took off a star for an experience I had with a group (6 people) where we felt very rushed, and the staff was rude.",
