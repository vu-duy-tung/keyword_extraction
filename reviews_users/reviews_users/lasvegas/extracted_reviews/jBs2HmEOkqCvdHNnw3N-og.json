I complained about how small the burgers were for the price and got nothing but excuses.  Average taste.  When you downsize the food and up size the price you're headed for the trash heap. In Vegas I can get an endless buffet for the same burger price.",

I orded the 15 dollar Black and Bleu burger with bleu cheese and portabello mushroom. When I get it , mushrooms are almost non existent and there is literally half a teaspoon of bleu cheese in the very center. My girlfriend got the Sriracha burger for 6 bucks and it was twice as big as mine. A Jack in the Box gourmet burger is better is better then this place. What is presented to you is a sad misrepresentation of what you get !!",

This review is more about the food since that was amazing.   The burger was perfect.  I ordered a blue cheese burger with crispy onions on a onion bun.  It wasn't the premium but there was no lacking in flavor because of it.  Because I'm very finicky about my sauces I ordered the BBQ on the side and it was actually delicious on the burger!  The fries I ordered the first time were well done and really crunchy without being burnt.  However to be less difficult I ordered my refills regular.  Apparently the birthday burger comes with fries! As I was not aware so that was a pleasant surprise.  Now since I received the burger and fry my bill came to a whopping 0.00 which was disheartening because I wanted to tip and I didn't have cash :(.  The waitress had to ring up a slice of cheese $1.49 to make it happen so if you go remember cash and enjoy! Red Robin is awesome.",

I tried the Chili ChiliTM Cheeseburger which the menu describes as follows.  \"You might need an extra napkin. Served open-face with a generous helping of Red's Chili ChiliTM, Cheddar cheese, chipotle aioli and diced red onions. Cleanup crew not included. $10.69 \"  Personally when I make chili I don't include beans. My wife on the other hand, does. The great debate of beans in chili will continue for another day.  I also noticed patio dining. Now, this Red Robin is part of a massive shopping center in northwest Las Vegas, Nevada. You exit the main dining floor, to the patio, which on the opposite side is part of the shopping center. The back exterior wall of a store and it's electrical boxes will be your view.  I like Red Robin, but personally I feel they just try a little TOO hard.",

    "text": "THIS RED ROBIN FLIES ABOVE 3.5 STARS     The Red Robin came to life in Seattle many years ago in 1969 as a gourmet burger restaurant. From that one restaurant, the Red Robin has flown across the American and Canadian landscape landing in several cities to take the casual dining customer under its wings. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, Red Robin has treated customers to an upbeat casual dining experience featuring a menu of gourmet burgers, specialty sandwiches, appetizing adult beverages, and dessert. In recent times, the Red Robin is soaring above some of its competition with thier bottomless fries.     Over twenty years have flown by since I last visited the Red Robin back in New York. I remember enjoying the food, but Long Islanders at the time did not take to the Red Robin causing it to relinquish it's space in the Smith Haven Mall to TGI Friday's. Twenty years later and last week, my brother and I were walking around the new-sprung Downtown Summerlin and took notice that a Red Robin is arriving the second week of November. So, yesterday after my brother and I left Floyd Lamb State Park (or Tulle Springs), it was in the top of my mind to have dinner in the Centennial Center Red Robin. And that is what we did.     When we walked into the relatively large waiting room, the attentive hostess let us know that there was a booth or table in the lounge, which is one of the two rooms in the restaurant, that she walked us to. The lounge features a bar and two large screen monitors that were at the time of the visit showing the NFL Green Bay verse Chicago game. At 9 P.M. on a Sunday the room was as quiet as a robin.     The pages of the menu displayed several burger sandwiches including the gourmet burger. My mind was set on fish and chips. These days I have been in the mood for fish and chips. Red Robin did not let me down. The three pieces of breaded fish had the right texture and crunch. The fish was the way I like it. I'd squeeze the lemons over the fish before dipping them in tarter sauce. But where was the Cole slaw? If there was that delicious Cole slaw that many restaurants serve with fish and chips, this red robin could of been flying above four stars. Where they scrimped on the Cole slaw, they were generous with the bottomless fries and Coke. Our easygoing waiter Landon was on the eight ball with the fries refills. He was kind enough to give us a portion to take home. The fries exceeded my expectations. In all honesty I thought they would be filler. The Red Robin bottomless fries is both quantity and quality. The fish and chips with bottomless Coke was worth $19 when you add in the upbeat atmosphere and good service.     Just like a red robin, the sky is the limit for the Las Vegas casual dining customer. The fact that I plan to return to Red Robin is testimony that they are doing something right. As I write this, a Red Robin is about to hatch in Downtown Summerlin by mid November. In a few weeks or less, I see a sequal Red Robin dining adventure in their newest location at Downtown Summerlin.",

I have found memories of the Royal Red Robin Burger w/ bottomless fries  and tater sauce while living in Richland, WA back in the 90's.  At this location I might not be able to recreate the 90's but the quality and the bottomless fries remain the same.  No longer is their any tarter sauce but a cornucopia of sauces.  One my most recent visit, I indulged in a garlic dipping sauce-MY NEW FAVORITE.  This location can get busy at times but is well worth the wait.  I have found the servers to be on point.  My drink is never empty for long, my fries always keep coming and it is never with any attitude.

Red Robin has a great selection of burgers and chicken sandwiches and their Vegan/Veggie alternatives are adequate for even the pickiest eaters. The bottomless fries with multiple dipping sauces is a great touch and the burgers are juicy and delicious. My only gripe with the burger itself is that it was way too messy and basically fell apart in my hands. Not sure if it was the soggy bun or the 2 lbs of sauce dripping out but it was an inconvenience and happens every time I eat here.  If you are looking for a highly priced, tasty burger Red Robin is definitely a good choice but there are plenty of places for less money that are much better in Las Vegas. Create in Summerlin still ranks much higher on my list.",

    "text": "I always love coming here, and ordering the same thing. But this time around, we decided to order the Just-in Quesadillas, for starters, and they are really good for a place that is known for their burgers. I did order the Banzai Burger, like I always do, as well as a Baily Irish Cream shake and a coke. I love pineapples, so the pineapples on the Banzai burger is always a plus, it just gives that fruity twist to a burger. The Baily's Irish Cream shake is always good, I usually finish that, before I even get my burger. Since I usually finish my shake before the food gets there, then ordering a coke is always a good thing, since you get free refills on coke.   The place itself is very spacious, and I like that you can move around, with out hitting a table or some one. The staff was really nice and right there, when your ready to take your order. Also I like the fact that they come around to check on you, to see if you need refills on drinks or fries.   If you love burgers with a twist, this is one of those places I would recommend. I love this place, and if I could live off it, I would, but got to watch my health.",

Food took over an hour to get even a side. Then when the food came only 2/3 of the order came with like 3 fries on each plate and to top it off that was the extra .99 cents garlic fries, and my burger and fries where so burnt I only took two bits and boxed it and tossed it in the trash at home. They even took food off our check but ended up leaving a two part check combined into one check with the other party's food all for free while I was left with burnt garbage that I paid full for minus my birthday burger. What a great gift from red robins. This is the second time here and they where both terrible. Red robins use to be great now they just expensive burnt burgers.",

    "text": "Eh.   Red Robin is one of those places you go to as an adult to grab a beer and burger without thinking about it.  We went over the weekend for our first Red Robin experience and was pleasantly surprised to see how crowded it was.  I assumed that, based on the number of seats taken that it would be a great place to eat a burger.  I also noticed that majority of the patrons were families with small children, so the whole beer and burger thing may be a tad of a stretch, at least for the crowd I saw.  We ordered the classic with cheese and some steak fries, a mint shake and one soda.  The shake comes with the mixer container still half full, which was nice for the five dollar price tag, and was a fairly good shake.  Standard, nothing mind blowing or amazing, but good.  The burgers came out really fast, and I was happy with the short wait.  They were wrapped in wax paper and came in baskets, which was nostalgic.  To top it off, they were huge!  I couldn't wrap my mouth around one, for some reason.  Still, once I took the first bite I was satisfied but not pleased.  I expected their burgers to somehow be different, more authentic or genuine in taste, but I didn't get that.  Although a good burger, I could get the same one for less somewhere else.  Overall, good burger and fries (especially since they are endless refills), but nothing that I'd go back for.  Great service, good burger and shakes, and fun little games in the lobby.  Hey--those kids were ga ga over the burgers, so I guess they're doing something worth while.  For me, personally, it was okay but I won't be back.",

My sever was Kory, she saw us within 5 minutes of being seated. She got our order for drinks and came back and asked if we had any questions about the menu. It was really busy this night we came, so when she came back with drinks we decided to order knowing it would take a minute for our food to arrive. Although the restaurant being busy she made a point to come see us and see if we could use a refill on our drinks and told us our food should be out shortly. There was a Dodger game going on so we were occupied for the mean time waiting on our food. Our food didn't take too long and Kory came to check on us here and there to see if we needed anything. The food was great, you can never go wrong with a burger here and need to mention the bottomless fries. What made the experience great was having excellent service from our server Kory! She made an effort to come check on us even though she had a load of other guest to help.",

I had a couple of discrepancies with the burger; the burger came out well done when it was ordered medium, and the egg was broken and overcooked.  The onion ring and fried mozzarella sticks appetizers were also OK.  I was not in love the appetizer sauces (marinara and tangy campfire).

I was really craving a burger last night and decided to give them another shot. I was SHOCKED with my burger in the best way ever. I got the black and blue burger (add bacon) and guys, this was the best damn burger I have had in years. It's one of the \"premium\" burgers so it's a few more dollars but man it was delicious. Sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, blue cheese, bacon and a grilled bun... just yum! Fries are fries... nothing riveting there but I did ask for a side of \"spicy ketchup\" and it was delicious, sort of had an oriental kick to it. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this burger, the service and the drinks... it was exactly what I was craving. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 is because there was at least 5 birthdays in the short time we were there and I already had a headache... it was a bit much (albeit, not their fault) but it took away from the experience for sure, quite distracting.",

We kept dying to keep him as busy as possible for \"our\" 30 mins wait. I'm very upset and disappointed. You shouldn't be telling anyone unrealistic wait times, exp when they have small children.

The server said it was just a chili seasoning that they use.  She tried to make up for it by providing some other sauce, but it just didn't work.    I swore that I would not go back, but unfortunately I did a few days ago. Thought I'd give them a second chance. After several minutes of looking at the menu, I decided to try their Grand Brie burger.  When the server finally came over and I said I'd try the Grand Brie burger, she said ok, but the only thing is that they're out of Brie.  Huh?  Yeah, I laughed a bit because that's like ordering their Chili Chili Cheeseburger and the server saying that they're out of Chili.  She suggested to replace it with Provolone cheese because a lot of customers said it was good.  I went with another type of cheese though.  In the end, it was just ok.  Their Balsamic Fig Jam that was in the burger tasted more like a light bbq sauce, which is not my thing.  The burger was supposed to be \"light\" pink, but it was almost breathing.  I did not send it back because I don't trust what they would do to it.    I must admit that I didn't notice the $14.99 price, and somehow thought that it fell under the $6.99 burgers.   If I had paid more attention, I definitely would not have ordered it after being told that they're out of Brie.  Yes, it's my fault, however, I do believe that they shouldn't offer that burger, because I'm sure the burger was priced higher because of the Brie.",

We had the fried zucchini and mushroom for appetizers. They were too oily. He had the Black & bleu burger with fries and it was flavorful but the garlic fries tasted old. I had the fish and chips with sweet potato fries and it was ok.

For a Wednesday night they were super busy, but our wait was only about 15 mins. and our hostess was very sweet.    We ordered for our apps, the queso with bottomless chips and then the Jump Starter Double with zucchini and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini sticks are to die for and the queso was delicious! For our entrees we ordered the Whiskey River burger, the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and the Black and Bleu burger.     The Black and Bleu burger was just okay. For another $3.00 more to order this particular  bleu cheese burger instead of the cheaper \"Blue Ribbon\" burger doesn't seem worth it to me. As always the fries were great, my complaint with them would be that my friend requested more sweet potato fries and they didn't get to her until she was basically finished with her burger (not the first or second or third time this has happened). So at that point it wasn't necessary.    We'd go back, but I do feel like the quality has slipped a bit over the years from this location.Skimping on the fries they give you when you first receive your order (then long waits for refills) and overall quality of their burgers and toppings.",

I also loved that I could order any side since I'm not eating fries. What made our visit even better was the service we received from Hector.

Then they said they were ready to seat us, and started leading us to a table in back, in the middle of the exam room chaos.   We told them we asked for a table in the bar. They said the two empty tables were unavailable.   Why they didn't tell us that 15 minutes before is a mystery, we didn't wait to have explained.   There are lots of other restaurants in the area. We will frequent them in the future!",

It took over 40 minutes to get our food and when they did bring it, it was only for one person in our party. The food was tasteless!!!  And the burger was over cooked. I asked for medium and got well done. The patty was unseasoned.  A little salt goes a long way.  My sisters grand daughter got the Mac n cheese and it had no flavor at all.  I don't think I'll ever be back. There are better burger places!!!",

    "text": "We were trying to think of a pace to eat in the Centennial area after our visit to the adjacent shopping mall. My boyfriend suggests Red Robin, YUMMM! We were excited walking in- he already knew he wanted the Whisky River BBQ burger with sweet potato fries.   Cons: 1. We were seated at a visibly dirty booth. I used my hands to sweep the crumbs off the table and seat before the hostess put down the menus and didn't offer to wipe the table down or seat us elsewhere. 2. Service was slow, it took us over 30 minutes from the time we put our order in to receive an incomplete order. My boyfriend got through half his burger before his fries came. 3. The cheese on both of our sandwiches was coagulated on top of the meat and my bun was really soggy- must've been sitting in the window for a while. 4. The bathrooms were a little dirty.  Pros: 1. Most of the food was good; onion rings and vanilla milkshakes especially.  2. Regular fries come bottomless (we usually upgrade our side though).  All in all, we probably won't be back to Red Robin for a while- if I had another choice for burgers (in this case you have at least 2- In-N-Out and Smashburger) I would probably head there. There's a certain expectation of service for $40 at a burger joint, and RR was severely disappointing this time around.",

The Bleu Ribbon Burger (Bleu Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion Strings, Onion Bun), $9.79 immediately jumped out at me when I browsed the menu, so I went for it. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=LX8XzvXLi__N_8hn2EPUdQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2...</a> Mom went for a Turkey Burger....she's been on a Turkey Burger kick lately. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2HmEOkqCvdHNnw3N-og?select=zD0Th0NI9ydO5MA2DogVmg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jBs2...</a>  The service was excellent, as usual, and the food came out quickly.  We requested our Burgers to be cut in half and they got it right.  I took one bite out of my Bleu Ribbon Burger and instantly became a fan....yum!  The Bleu Cheese and Onion Straws gave the Burger a unique flavor that tasted soooo good.  It left me wanting more when I was finished....which is the tell-tale sign for me that I enjoyed the grub.  Overall, the experience was very good.  Return Factor - 90%",

No personality. We tell him it's our sons birthday and he just says ok.  Drinks and food were adequate/ nothing was really that much of a standout.  The salad I got tasted wilted.  The kicker to all of it... The server forgot his birthday.  He brings the check and my husband quietly mentions hey... His birthday. Ricky says oh yeah and walks off with zero apology.  They come out, sing the song, and walk off without saying a word.  What a disappointment.  We will never be back thanks to Ricky's awful service.",

Wasn't too busy but there were about 5 waitresses working.   Can I tell you that 4 of them were gathered in a circle by where the food comes out just chit chatting. I was getting pissed standing there by the hostess' stand while the girls were chatting about their weekend. I literally had to speak up and say \"excuse me!\" Normally im not so straight forward, but hey, i was 5 months pregnant, starving and obviously my hormones were raging. Not the person to mess with FYI. Minus one star.  We were sat immediately after my comment and I turned to my husband and said if we get one of those girls I'm going to scream..  Luckily for all the other patrons in the restaurant we were given another waitress.. one you could tell was working her ass off. WTG! Now i was a happy camper! She quickly got us our drinks and asked if it was our first time or  if we had any questions.  Looking at the menu I quickly knew I was going to have a hard time choosing. I was stuck between the mouthwatering chicken sandwich. Another with bacon and onion straws or my favorites caesar salad & tortilla soup. What made it even harder was that the 1st two choices came with unlimited fries. You heard me... UNLIMITED FRIES! Thats a pregnant womans dream.  Knowing that my hubby was getting a burger I opted for the salad and soup and figured i'd be a \"naughty\" girl and steal some of his fries. I mean, shoot they're unlimited so why not.  While waiting for our food, I turned and OMG those 4 people were still just standing there talking.. I was about to ask for the manager when i noticed a manager walking over to them and scolding. Dang! about time. They only cost the company an hours worth of pay!  The food was delish. Fries were always warm and seasoned to perfection. My salad had freshly cut lettuce and enough crutons for my hearts desires. My tortilla soup was perfect. I asked for extra cheese and sour cream. hey, im pregnant, im allowed those extra carbs! And it made it so rich and thick. Mmm, mmm.   Our waitress continued to give us fantastic service. our drinks were always full. Fries always on the way. Ranch for our fries too. My party and I left happy and full.   Def coming back here. But I better not get one of those girls!",

Originally we were aiming for some Mexican Food, but we saw Red Robin right next door and my boyfriend suggested going. I've never been to Red Robin before, so of course I said yes.   The place was pretty empty, not surprising since it was only 11am and they just opened. We were seated and given water. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share since we didn't want to get too full before the burgers came. The waitress brought it out in two small cups, which was very nice. The soup was light, but very flavorful and pretty yummy. Each cup came with a small piece of bread that went perfect with the soup.   My boyfriend ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger and I ordered the Pub Burger.  Both orders came with bottomless steak fries.  We also ordered peach tea and freckled lemonade, both were bottomless as well.  The Pub was okay, nothing too great. The Guac Bacon Burder, however, was mouthwatering and the steak fries were very savory; I probably had mine refilled like 3 times.   I really like that they give you bottomless fries with your burger and it's an added bonus that the specialty beverages were also bottomless.   The service is fast and friendly and the food is pretty awesome.",

You may also want to coach your staff on cleanliness...you had a server sneeze, wipe her nose on her wrist then grab food at the window...yuck!",

The service was on point, the restaurant was clean and neat. My food arrived fast and hot. I ordered the blue cheese burger and steak fries. My girlfriend ordered the Hawaiian burger and steak fries. They were each around $10.00 a piece and worth every cent. Cooked perfectly medium and the fries were also right. I asked for more fries and had two more orders on my table before I knew it. Free refills on fries and free ranch dipping sauce. I felt very satisfied as I was leaving the restaurant. I would definitely recommend Red Robin to my friends and family. I look forward to my return to Red Robin.",

Let me get to my major complaint, the definition of Medium. My burger was crispy and dry. When I sent it back, it came back crispy and dry and cut in half and cold. I think they are brown/red color blind. For $14, I expect much much more. The fries were limp, as if the fry oil wasn't up to temp before they dropped. Everyone can have an off day however this is the second time with the same complaints. The server was more attentive the last time I was there. Overall, a terrible experience! I am Celiac (with other severe food allergies) so the places I can go and actually expect to eat more than a salad are kinda limited. So this was doubly disappointing. Sucks!",

The manager hustles like crazy and makes sure everything is operating properly and the waiters-waitresses hustle and are very attentive.   Sometimes eating out is about feeding your hunger, sometimes it is just to get a break and not having to cook.

What's up with these places serving plain burgers? Maybe there are people that eat burgers with nothing on them. To me, the burgers would be dry, even if it's cooked medium, without extra flavoring. The service was just not the greatest. When buzzed the thing on the table for the waitress, she never came. As for bottomless fries, you have to practically hunt them down to get more. We were playing their Trivia game and didn't know it cost anything until we saw it on the bill. Both of us did not see any notification of that. They did remove it off the bill.",

Ask for the fries with no salt and you will get them hot every time. Then you can add their fry seasoning yourself! They have new dipping sauces for the fries. Most are free but a few are \"premium\" meaning they cost $$$. We tried all the free ones and my favorite was the house sauce it was kind of like a thousand island. I haven't been to RR in a long time but when I use to go they would always bring a basket of fries while you waited for your food. So when we asked the server about this she told us \"we don't do that anymore you have to wait to get your meal first\" why???? Honestly I'm glad we had a gift card otherwise we probably wouldn't have gone. And for 80 bux for a party of 4 ehhhhh i think I'll pass next time!",

Both were very flavorful and fresh.  Daughter had a chicken salad (which she demolished) and I ordered the All American Patty Melt.  I loved that they even asked how I wanted my burger cooked.  The Melt was on point with this fabulous marbled rye bread.  It was very generous and I had to take half of it home.

We finally called a manager to see what was taking so long. Our waitress apologized tons saying  she had no clue why the kitchen was taking long. Finally the manager told us our food was pushed to the side, forgotten and got cold. She had the kitchen make fresh meals for us and our dinners were on the house. While we waited they kept refilling our fries. The manager apologized again and again. We felt bad for our waitress because it was not her fault and she did take care of us and noticed something was wrong as well as the manager. They handled the situation well.

No one should get that kind of service.",

    "text": "(Update at bottom)  I don't think I've had a worse tasting guacamole bacon burger.   We made a to go order. I arrived a few minutes after the scheduled pick up time (approx 30 minutes after we ordered), waited an additional 30 minutes to get the food. It's a 5 minute drive back to my house and in the 7 minutes it took to drive home and unload, all our food was stone cold. I'm pretty reluctant to believe that it went from piping hot to stone cold in a matter of minutes. It honestly tasted like it had been left sitting & waiting for the 30 minutes I waited to even get the food.   Overall, everything was highly unimpressive. My mom and stepdad ordered the simple burger and both said it was just okay. Huge disappointment to pay $10 for a burger comparable to something you'd get from McDonalds or Wendy's.   And then my guacamole bacon burger. I'm not sure why they say it has guacamole in it, I couldn't even taste it. I could barely tell it had guacamole on it. The bacon was subpar. I asked for pickles, they weren't on it. And again, it was stone cold by the time we got to eat it. Not warm in the slightest. Completely cold. Which is odd since I've ordered take out often enough to have experienced that it doesn't usually get cold after less than 10 minutes.   Overall, it was a complete waste of an hour and $50. I wish I had just run to the grocery store and gotten stuff to make burgers myself. Not only would we have eaten sooner, but it would have tasted far better. Also, since it appears no one from the restaurant actually checks the Yelp reviews, I plan on calling the restaurant and sharing my experience. I will update with what they say.  UPDATE: I did call & speak with a manager. She was very kind & listened intently as I explained my experience. She offered to send a gift card to cover the cost of our meal so we can try it again. She did say that it was unusual for food to be cold & acknowledged the long wait. I very much appreciate the gesture and we will try it again. I will update my review after we try it again. Since the review was about the food specifically & not the service, I won't be changing it at this time. But maybe when we trying it again.",

The prices aren't too bad for the food, but purpose for this review is to give our server Johnny, I believe, a shout out for being so awesome! The 5 stars go to him, honestly & it's rare that I enjoy service!  Walking in, we were seated in a less crowded area at a roomy table and was immediately met with our server. My mom had a bday coupon & another one, & had asked the server about them. He kindly said he would grant the bday coupon, but was unsure about the other & will ask the manager as well as our drink orders.  Our food came out quickly & was hot and fresh. Here's the breakdown (only including ratings for the first two because that's what my daughter & I ordered):  Sauteed 'Shroom (4/5): Requested a little pink, I like a juicy burger! It was pretty good, I just wish it was seasoned a little more. You know a burger is da bomb when you don't have to add much to make it taste good.   Kid's Menu Swirly Twirly Pasta (5/5): Easy, simple & fun for the kids. Macaroni in a marinara sauce & sprinkled w/ cheese, choice of side & a drink!  Kid's Menu Bottomless Mac n Cheese  Whiskey River BBQ Burger  Burnin Love Burger  Simple Grilled Chicken Burger  Banzai Burger (To Go)  Bottomless Fries & Bottomless Side Salads  Our server checked on us frequently, always replenished our fries/salads/drinks & was very polite & friendly. Please ask to sit in his section if you want prompt & efficient service!",

    "text": "It's my birthday so the family asked me where I'd like to go. I really do like Red Robin so we went tonight at 7:00, short wait but that's usual. We go a few times a year. This was the first time back after a less than stellar experience the last time, that was at the end of the last school year. I didn't leave a review the last time because it was much busier and everyone has an off night from time to time.   The server (Josh) was nice but I don't know if he had more tables than he could handle or what but we were abandoned for most of the time we were there. My daughter ordered a burger but when the order came, delivered by someone that wasn't Josh she got chicken instead of beef. She's a bit soft spoken so I thought maybe he didn't hear her when she ordered but then I remembered he asked if she wanted \"a little pink or no pink?\" So that would have to be referring to a beef patty. When the guy that brought the food came back with some more fries to give her something to eat while she waited. By the time the replacement burger was ready we had mostly finished our entrees. My wife liked her burger, my youngest daughter liked her Mac-n-cheese, my blue-ribbon burger was ordered with some pink but was mostly pink, it was good but I hate thinking \"I hope I don't get sick\" the whole time I was eating it. The replacement burger for my oldest was supposed to be well done and also had some pink.     When the guy brought out the replacement burger and we were almost done he commented that he should probably take it off the bill. It was a nice gesture, we didn't ask for it but did appreciate it. Then the bill came and our original server was back, he clicked the small screen on the table and said we should just pay here and he was off. Looked through the bill and no alterations were made so we hit a call button. Waited for some time (with and empty drink) to see if they were in fact going to comp the burger after all. When I asked about it, his response was \"I think he meant he'd not charge you for the chicken sandwich you didn't order\" what a weird response. Of course I'm not buying the sandwich I didn't order, why would that even be a possibility? Anyway next time I might have to try a different location.",

Brian P. likes to come here thanks to their rewards program so I've tried everything from their salads to their burgers. While everything tastes fine, there's nothing to write home about.  My biggest gripe is how cramped everything is. I can't cross my legs at the table without blocking the flow of traffic. Staff were bumping into me while I was seated. The tables are just way too close together. Luckily nothing spilled on me.   While I'll probably get flak for this, as a non tattooed person, I'm going to mention it. The staff looks wrecked here, which doesn't instill confidence in me. If you wanna tat your face, cool, but cover that up for food service. Neck tats, breast tats, back tats and sleeves that are hanging out. Why are staff wearing clothing that shows of back tats and breast tats in a restaurant? This isn't Coyote Ugly. The tats and lack of grooming  standards looks unkempt.   Service is okay. Refills of water and bottomless items are hard to come by so meh, this place is just ok.",

However this particular time I waited for 3 separate visits to the restaurant the staff are always very friendly. Fast and prompt with orders but for some reason each of the 3 times I have come to this particular location. My order comes back to the table wrong.  I should also note that I am allergic to  tomato ,  Which I explain to the server. This is one of the reasons my order comes out wrong every time.Now I'm not sure if it's the kitchen's fault but this is what I'm led to believe by the server each time. However 2 times the server did not use a notepad to write down my order. Anyhow whenever my food would come to the table the order would be wrong my husband would end up eating with out me or letting his food get cold while they went to have it remade very disappointing not intrested in going back to this location but still love the Red Robin.",

We ordered the Voodoo fires and pretzel bites to start, they came out fast and were good.  The Voodoo fries were thrown together but they tasted good.  We ordered some burgers and they were okay.  The meat did not have much flavor so it could have used some seasoning.  The Southern Charm burger was not so good.  The bottom bun was just a wet mess and had to be removed form the burger or picking it up felt nasty.  Ended up eating it with a fork because the bottom bun was falling apart due to being so wet.  The candied bacon was great but the caramelized onions were not looking so hot.  They were soggy and the color of them was off, most likely they were old.  Wish we would have had a better food experience so we felt better about coming back sooner.",

My wife orders the Ensenada chicken platter with no ranch dressing every time we go due to allergies. When our order go to the table her chicken look different from the previous 800 visits. They had poured the ancho seasoning on it after it was fried and it was running off the chicken breast. Typically there is a thin coat of seasoning that looks like it was grilled on...not a pool. Our server told us that's how it supposed to be and that she was getting her manager to handle it. After waiting 15 minutes the manager finally arrived and instead of introducing himself he asked \"what's the problem.\" When we told him what \"the problem\" was he said he eats that three times a week and it looks the same. I informed him we were regular customers and my wife has ordered the same thing for several  years and it has never looked like this. His demeanor changed and he asked what we wanted him to do about it. We didn't ask for a credit but an exchange. We will never eat here again. The manager needs to go.",

They take down your number and text you when your table is ready so you can leave if you'd like. It was cold out so we stayed in the waiting area. I liked that there was plenty of seating and a chalkboard for kids (and adults) to draw on.   The host, Jorge was running around bussing tables and seating customers. Although he was super busy, he was very nice and helpful. We were seated in a booth in the bar area. Our server was the bartender so she wasn't as attentive as I'd like. Understandable though as she had to make all the drinks and serve people at the bar.... but there were only 4 people at the bar and her other table already got their check. Service was pretty slow but she was nice enough. Our food took over 35 minutes to come out and it wasn't hot.... Not sure how long it sat on the window but someone should have ran it out for the bartender.   I ordered the whisky bbq burger and it was pretty good. Cooked medium, just as requested. I did wish that the cheese was melted though. The cheddar cheese on the burger wasn't even slightly melted at all and it was lacking in veggies. Other than that, if you love bbq, I'd highly recommend it. Fries were also cold but I love their unlimited steak fries regardless!   Not the worst experience I've had at a Red Robin but not the best either. I'll probably ask to sit in the regular dining area next time or sit directly at the bar to get better service.",

It was Cinco de Mayo and I really wanted a margarita and some Mexican food.  My dreams were quickly dashed when I passed up on two restaurants because of the corwded parking lots and busy mad house dining rooms.  I saw the Red Robin next to the Michoacan restaurant and figured they would have a bar that could serve me up a margarita and would perhaps not be too busy.  My hunch paid off and I got my margarita and dinner with little wait.  Since I was hoping for Mexican food and that is not he specialty of Red Robin  I went with the next best thing and ordered a guacamole bacon burger.  It did not look like much when it came out to me but you really cannot judge a book by its cover.  This burger was superb.  the guacamole was there and delicious without overwhelming the rest of the burger components. I was able to taste each topping as well as the awesome beefiness of the patty.  I could taste the char and it reminded me of a 4th of July backyard BBQ.  Oh, the memories that came flooding back to my mind.  All with one simple bite of a burger.  I don't know why I don't do this more often.",

He had an attitude like if he hated his job, and you can see it in his look.. unfortunately for him, his tables were scattered all over the place, which I'm sure is not very pleasant. But, that's still no excuse to show how much you hate your job. We constantly had to ask for stuff, and it took a long time, each time.. we didn't feel very welcomed by him, we just felt like he wanted us in and out.. I use to love this place, but I don't think I'll be back..",

Seated promptly by a very friendly hostess and a server came right away,  took our drink and appetizer order and told us he wished he didn't have to hand us off because we looked like a good table but he was changing shifts (carlton)... daughter got her milkshake pretty quickly,  10 minutes go by the new server appears and confirms our appetizer and drink order and takes our food order.  Goes to the bar to check on our beers, 5 minutes later comes back to say the keg is to cold and it can't be poured.   No problem!  He then asks if we would like water, good upsell by the way, we suggest bottles.  10 minutes later he comes back to say they don't carry bottles.  We still have no appetizers,  no food,  no drinks (not even water!).  We tell him to cash us out on the milkshake and ask for the manager.   She comes to the table, what a joke!

My Whiskey Jack BBQ chicken burger was yummy and gone within minutes and my steak fries were satisfyingly thick and salty and starchy.  (Bottomless fries!!)  We also got the red velvet cake which wasn't too bad for something taken out of the freezer.  While RR would not be my usual choice for dinner fare, it was fun and close by and convenient.  If you have picky friends, this place would be appealing and \"safe.\"",

It was past prime time so there wasn't a wait.  Realize there is only 2 of us.  I order a gin and tonic with lime and my husband orders a beer.  When the server (unknown name because he had no name tag on). He threw down the beer in front of me and the gin and tonic with no lime in front of my husband.  After trying to get his attention numerous times I got up and went to bar for my own lime.  No bartender around.  Then a women threw a lime on a stick in my drink and said here.  Then the chicken we ordered was served, obviously the chicken orders were placed in front of the wrong person, but even the sauce was not right.  Then my husband went to the bathroom.  It was so filthy he came out and said he'd wait.  We were so disappointed we asked to see a manager after we paid the bill and we were leaving.  Finally a woman came up front. Didn't introduce herself, and as we were telling her our story she says. Yea yea ok ii know about your lime.  Then my husband asked her about her name tag... \"I'm a manager and I don't have to wear a name tag\".  I don't know Red Robin's policy but I would hope the chain would have some standards for cleanliness.  This no name manager didn't, and I don't have to patron Red Robin.",

Which is slightly understandable since EVERY time I go here, no matter when or why, it is packed. I hadn't been here since high school, when I didn't care about anything but eating junk and hanging out with my friends in the few places that teens could go to. It's a great place for that, for when you are a kid and have money to burn on low end food. The biggest gimmick they have is their 'types' of burgers. It seems that they have a mass amount of patties in the back, all the same, but they throw different things on top and call them gourmet burgers. For 10$ or more each. Yeah, you get 'bottomless fries' (which are, hilariously, in an actual bottomless cylinder) but that is only if your waiter/waitress is around to notice you want/need more. They give you a hand full of tasteless steak fries. How can one make fries so bland? There is a reason they give every table a giant shaker of seasoning.  I got a Gardenburger. Which is, a Gardenburger you can buy at the store. They also serve the vegan Boca patty...also bought at the store. You can sub any veggie patty for any type of burger, but really, it doesn't make a difference.",

As soon as we parked and started walking in, we got a text that said our table was ready. We walked into the restaurant and there was a family ahead of us being helped by the hostess. She told them that she'll take them right back. She walked away for a minute, then came back and took another family instead that seemed to be waiting outside. Which is annoying, but I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. If they were here first, they should be taken back first. Another hostess, an older woman, came and asked if we have been helped. I said no we have not. No further acknowledgment. She was stumbling through some menus when a new couple entered and said \"I got a text that said we were ready to be seated\" she then took them back right away. Still skipping over myself, and the couple that was here before me. Both of us were upset. When a third hostess came, she took the first couple back. My Fiance and I were now the only people in the front room. And still, have not been helped. Finally the older woman came back. She asked what she could help us with and we explained we got a text 15 minutes ago that said our table was ready. \"Just give me a minute, okay?\" was her response and she walks away again. At this point, we are peaking out the window to see if there was a wait at Olive Garden. But we were in the mood for a burger and we thought that maybe it's just busy. We FINALLY got seated and the place was not very busy at all. The food was good, which is why I am giving them 3 stars. But I think it's ridiculous that I had to wait another 20 minutes after my table was supposed to be ready, and have 2 other people seated before me.",

    "text": "Red Robin manages to get two stars because of the service, but otherwise I was really disappointed in the quality of their food recently. I had the chicken and waffles special since I was not in a huge mood for a burger and I wanted to try something new.  The sauce they use does not really match with what I would have wanted in a chicken/waffles dish/sandwich.  It was a runny spicy kind of sauce, I would have thought it would be a creamy or ranch like sauce.  It wasn't.  Then came the larger disappointment, the waffle was cold, dense, and not appealing at all. I came in later in the evening after working all day, so I really wanted to sit at the bar, but the bar and the seats were messy.  The entire bar area seemed to not to be clean. Nothing to really brag about that $12.99 sandwich other than a $5 sandwich from other fast food joints.",

A table of hungry 13 family members, we sat in Tony's section. He was very attentive, our drinks were refilled automatically and he was a great waiter! Thank You Tony for making our family feel welcomed even with 13 of us. The food was spectacular! The best onion rings and the best burgers.",

How's that for being a member? I highly recommend you join their club so you can cash in on this birthday deal. Just go to their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redrobin.com&s=0910116db154751e50bb1dadd44a14369f780c08c8ca6f33546d0135416806ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">redrobin.com</a> and sign up.  What I got was the Berserker Burger which was inspired by the movie Wolverine. It is a flavorful combination of zesty Aioli, Sriracha Onion Straws, Spicy Pickles, and Cheddar Cheese on a Brioche Bun. This burger is for a limited time only so get it while its still available! Of course, with any burger that you choose, you get their signature bottomless Steak Fries! Don't forget to put the patented Red Robin fry seasoning on there as well.  Service was good. We were greeted right away and was sat down. Our server came around and got our orders. I made sure to let her know I had the free birthday burger. I know some places when you get free stuff the quality of service tends to go down because of the big discount on the overall check. Our server did very well and I tipped her like I never had the free burger so she really deserved it.  The only thing that made me subtract a star is that when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, there were paper towels all over the floor. I notified a manager and they said they will take care of it. After finishing my meal which was about half an hour later, I went back to the bathroom again to wash my hands and it was still the same. So somebody failed to clean up.   Overall, I was pleasantly surprised on how everything went. You guys just need to keep an eye out for your bathrooms.",

I always stick with the royal Red Robin burger and I have never been disappointed. The service could be better, but it isn't necessarily bad. I see this location always busy, especially during the weekends, so I'm sure there's quite a lot of people that agree with me. Anyway, it's a good family restaurant, and it surely won't let you down. You know what to expect and they always satisfy you. Kudos to Red Robin",

I try to usually go for lunch or early dinner when the atmosphere is more relaxed, yet efficient. My favorite and go-to is usually the Royal Red Robin, but I recently had the Guacamole Bacon, and it was just as good. Seriously like the way they cook the fried egg on the Royal 'cause once you slice into it, the yolk just melts into the rest of the ingredients. As for the Guacamole Bacon, it was just a good spread to the sandwich and not as messy XD As usual, I liked their fries. My sister and I kinda had less for the first serving of fries, so we ended up asking for a second plate. She also had the Garlic Aoili fries, which she enjoys, but they kinda over-seasoned it this time. Still good though. Don't forget to ask for extra napkins 'cause eating the burgers could get messy.   As far as drinks go, I like their Fireball Peach Smash (especially in the spring and summer). This time we had both gotten Not Your Father's Root Beer. I just thought it was cool 'cause it's a new menu item.  I had forgotten our server's name, but she was pretty good. She constantly checked up on us during our meal, and helped me out when it came to paying for the bill on their new table devices. The hostess that seated my sister and I even checked up on us when our server was busy in the beginning.",

I hope they open a location in Honolulu Hawaii I'll be one of their regular customers. I would love to try other items on their menu. I'm sad that I only had one opportunity to eat there. The atmosphere was very family friendly and the service was great. I enjoyed my experience and is looking forward to going again.",

General Manager came by and did the usual, \"How was everything?\"  I told her the food tasted great but the service side of things today was very lacking.  I told her we have been to this location many times and this is the first time we have been disappointed by anything.  She apologized and comped the entire check!!!

We asked for the condiments on the side so they weren't soggy but that didn't happen. Barely any fries & no extra order like usual. For as expensive as it was I was expecting a lot better quality. We'll have to rethink about ordering Red Robin since this experience was sad & disappointing.",

But no one came to greet us waitresses kept walking by, and at one point I think the manager walked by. The place was not even that busy. There were maybe five other tables going. No one acknowledged our presence for 30 min. Not even a I'll be right with you, no drink order. My hungry family and I decided to walk out, and still no acknowledgement except for by the host who said to have a good night. We went to the restaurant next door and were sat immediately and served right away.",

They changed the menu just yesterday, this would be good to know prior to being seated. If you want to be a beer and burger bar, post the menu outside the door just like all other bars.  As luck would have it, the stuff I normally order is no longer offered. I totally get that, change is always good, but maybe you can let your customers know up front.   Of course, once I ordered something, the server told me they were out of eggs? Seriously, does Las Vegas have a shortage of eggs? Easter has long past, I think they have been restocked.    Service sucked. I will let certain things slide if the service is great, not today Red \"Fail\" Robin.    My money is going else where.",

Since moving to Las Vegas, we have experienced some spiraling downhill issues with the Red Robin in Centennial Hills, This is the closest location to our home.  I must say, after two bad experiences that you can re about here on Yelp, we decided to go one final time to see if things were corrected.   So after 4 adults, and 15 kids are seated, here comes Enrique. Huge smile, knows my family and knows how to remain calm under pressure. This man deserves a promotion. If he was to train the staff, whether new or old, this place would be untouchable. He was on top of drinks, fries, refills, and the food order. All of our food came out in a timely manner and was accurate to the \"T\". (Plus, everyone received their food at the same time).  Again, Enrique needs to be the lead trainer or manager because he is incredible. Hats off to you Enrique, and we will be seeing you again soon as we will be requesting to sit in your section on our next visit.",

    "text": "I don't like writing negative reviews, but my wife had a great point. These restaurants need the reviews so they can improve on their weaknesses.   I will first start with the hostess. She was friendly and professional, but when we asked to be seated at a booth, we were placed in a completely packed area. Everybody in the restaurant was all seated in the same spot. There were many open seats available, but for what I assumed was convenience to the waitress we were all packed in like sardines. I finally asked my waitress if we could move to another part of the dining area.  We ordered an appetizer of onion rings. When the girl brought our onion rings she set two plates on the table and one of them had some type of red substance on the edge of it. I set the dish outside and moved on. The substance was still wet by the way. I didn't want to risk getting sick. Maybe it was old ketchup or maybe blood, haha kidding, but maybe.   Our waitress was polite and did her job as usual. During our meal we had a few dirty plates and sauce containers that we needed removed from the table. The busboy approached the table multiple times asking if we needed anything. He even touched the dirty dish for some reason and then let it go and walk away. The dishes were obviously stacked for removal and sitting at a small table that should have been addressed.  I think if the customer has to ask for dirty dishes to be removed from the table it puts them in an awkward position.  Moving on from that, I ate my pink in the middle burger and then asked for the check. I had ordered my burger well done or at least with no pink. I did not want to cause any more static for this waitstaff. I just wanted to leave at that point.    The waitress then brought out my bill. Wow, every time I come to this restaurant I always tell myself never again. I paid $40 for two people to eat. Two burgers,two drinks, and one stack of onion rings-40 dollars. I know it's not cheap to provide quality food these days. Food prices have risen in the past few years, but, this is ridiculous. My wife and I were doing the math during the car ride home and figured the onion rings cost $10.  So like I said, I don't like doing negative reviews but this had to be said. Red Robin charges a huge amount of money for a low quality product in my opinion. I don't think I will be returning here anytime soon.",

So I'm giving a VERY GENEROUS 4. The service was great! The food wasn't great this time.  They did a remodel in the last year, and I have to say I do NOT like it. They went for a more fancy/classy feel...and it totally takes away from the family atmosphere you expect from Red Robin!",

We a kids chicken strip which was overcooked and cold. We also got a kids cheese pizza which was undercooked (doughy)and cold. We also got a blue burger which was soggy and cold. The only thing that was hot was the bottomless fries (which was really good, got to give the credit for that) I'm sorry but never again.",

She was amazing and helpful in making the right selection for our allergy needs.  And the food was great!  We usually can't get fries anywhere because of cross contamination, but their fries are cooked in dedicated fryers.  Do we all enjoyed fries for a change!  They even had a gluten free bun for my burger (not listed on the menu, so ask when you go).",

This time I got the a1 peppercorn burger, my man got some ghost pepper one, one tall blue moon, a Coke, we got bbq wings, and onion rings as well. Everything was super good. Jackie was extremely friendly!!! When I come back I'll definitely ask for her again. (: I asked for my burger to be medium but got well done. I noticed it was a little dry (still good and nothing sauce can't fix) so I simply just told the waitress. I wasn't mad at all either. She apologized and asked if I wanted a new one but I denied. She sent the manager Kristen or Kristy over and she apologized and asked if I wanted a new one. Again, I kindly denied and we chatted for a bit. When we were about to pay, the manager came up to our system and comped off my burger entirely. I was expecting the beer or drink to be comped but an entire burger? That's going above and beyond. She didn't have to, so it left us surprised. I left extremely happy and thankful! I'll be back soon!!!!",

The system also lets you split your bill if you are with friends. No need to wait for the server to do it. As far as food goes, I like the taste of the burgers, tasted the fiery burger, the special Uberburger, and the bansai burger. The negative on the meal was that the bottom bun of the uberburger was wet in spots so when sharing, i ended up forking my piece of burger. The other negative was that i ordered my fry refill when I was almost out. I should have done it earlier because there was a small wait so I had to pause eating. Can't eat a burger without the fries. So word to the wise, don't wait till your out to get the next basket of fries. Thomas Wa was our server and he was a blast. Funny, attentive and concerned about our experience. I like servers who are willing to share a bit of themselves instead of being only businesslike. He is that type of server.",

She acted like my grandson and I were keeping her from doing something else. One ice tea and I was done after that she waited until we were all done to ask if I wanted another ice tea. My grandson didn't even touch his apple juice I ask for a to go cup and get nothing. I will re-evaluate my decision on returning to Red Robin after tonight.  I am the customer I worked my 10 hour shift today and everyday if I am tired or not in the mood it's no one else's problem when I am work. I don't project my bad mood onto someone I work with or for when I am at work. That's a work ethic if you don't want to be there don't make your poor choice my problem either call in or check It at the door because I don't need your bad attitude. It seems like that is the attitude in Las Vegas no work ethic and make the customer feel uncomfortable or make us pay the price because you don't want to be at work or can't put something on the side to do your job.",

On a bright note the onion ring appetizer tower and beer were delicious, almost like they were cooked in a different kitchen. Our server was also decent. We were told that the wait would be fifteen minutes, more like thirty minutes. I would not recommend eating at Red Robin due to the fact that they can't master what they are known for, burgers.

The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because Eric the manager comped the meal after I called in freaking out. First off you used I be able to order a side of fries for free (because they are bottomless) however they don't do that anymore so you have to pay 2 bucks more... With that two bucks you will get 11 fries, well that's what we got anyway. But what got me the most was that I specifically asked for my burger to be well done.... The thing was mooing. Oh man it was so gross! I have included pictures because it was just that bad. I know it's a chain and let's face it... Sometimes chains just don't have the best food but really...

    "text": "This is by far our favorite casual dining place here in Las Vegas. It's also by far the best place to take kids to eat. The kids meals are super  reasonably priced compared to similar restaurants, the burgers are awesome not to mention KETO friendly (make it Wedgie style!!), and overall, our go-to casual dining restaurant.   As a parent, they bring out the kids meals first, which is a life saver considering all my three kids are under 5. They also bring out the bottomless fries in the beginning, another awesome feature to tide the kiddos over. As you can tell, my review is centered around how they cater to parents and kids--they are by far the best. My kids love getting their red balloon each time we dine  I also want to recognize an outstanding wait staff--Shindena. She took great care of us, especially so considering our huge party of 11. When you check in, always ask for Shindena! She will take great care of you. She deserves some serious recognition, as I haven't had service like that in a long time. Kudos to having her on your staff!",

Other than that everything else just wasn't up to par. We ordered appetizers, two burgers with fries. I don't know what happened but our food was cold! We never had this happen to us. We were so disappointed because this was one of our first date spots.",

    "text": "I'm not sure if this location is under newer management but last couple of times I've been here haven't been the best. There seems to be a lot of newer staff; a lot of younger people and a few older folks. Most of them seem like they're not too confident in what they're doing. For example: our server, who will remain nameless, didn't greet us at our table for over 10 minutes. We even noticed another table in their section go into the kitchen area just to grab the server to show them how to pay their tab on the self service kiosk that's on every table. Our server finally comes over, thanks us for our patience, and takes our order. Then the wait for the food is abnormally long. Granted, it's a Friday night and it was pretty busy but it shouldn't take as long as it did for 2 burgers. There was a table of 5 that was seated AFTER us and got their food BEFORE us and that's because they had a different server. I think ours forgot about our food in the ready window, if I'm being honest. I love Red Robin but I think going forward, I'll be taking my business to the Downtown Summerlin location.",

We asked for more fries but after 10 minutes of waiting with no fries in sight we decided to just leave. Not sure if they forgot or they were just super backed up but 10 minutes for what was supposed to be bottomless fries was way too long in my opinion. I think this was just a one off experience so we'll most likely still come back.",

    "text": "So went in today to have lunch with some friends and as usual, this location was really busy. When we walked in we were told it was an hour wait. However the wait was only 30 min and very reasonable due to today being the last day of school do the local school district so a lot folks out celebrating.   Once we were seated, the hostess was very kind and explained basics to us (who our server is, you need anything, etc. ect.). It didn't seem to take long for our server to get our drink order as well as our food order. Again, the restaurant was slammed!!!, and thou you could see it, the staff did a great job at being attentive to their responsibilities.  One concern we had was our food would get cold waiting, but that did not happen. When the pay tablet didn't work, the manager was quick to help us out.  In Conclusion, I know I didn't mention much about the food as I believe its well known, however, I believe that the service was some of the best I have experienced in some time at this restaurant and was really impressed.",

She was constantly tending to those who got there later than us that were not colored if they were good, if they wanted fries meanwhile their food came so on and so forth. We were only a party of three and this group was bigger I figure it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to tend to a smaller party easier. She literally only came to take our order and give it to us. We had to ask other waitresses for refills etc. Food was good and some workers were nice but I wouldn't return to this location.",

    "text": "I really like this Red Robin; it's such a nice place for family evenings-out (even for small children). The staff is always nice and attentive and the food is excellent. Plus, who wouldn't love all-you-can-eat fries?!!?!!  We always start with fries with ranch and BBQ sauce while my sons imbibe in bottomless root beer floats. The wait staff is always willing to refill the fries and floats whenever asked.  I always order the Bonzai Burger with a vegetarian patty. I love the flavors and the burgers are pretty big. In fact, I always cut mine in half as soon as it arrives and put half of it in a to-go container (after all, I filled up on fries!). The meatless patty is standard, not a house-made concoction, so not much more than what I could cook at home.  I really like that they encourage family socialization with chalkboard activities and I like the ability to order and check out using an iPad at the table. Best of all, I like that you get a free dessert when you come for your birthday!  On one occasion when my son's order was incorrect, our server immediately re-placed the order. The manager then came to apologize and ask if my son wanted anything while he was waiting. We were very pleased with the gesture. His burger was back (hot and correct) in less than five minutes.  The wait to get a table can be ridiculous. Be sure to come during off-hours so you won't have an hour-long wait.",

    "text": "The last time I went to Red Robin was probably 10 years ago and I remember liking their onion rings and bottomless fries. I went here last night for a kid's birthday party. Parking was scarce because there's a lot of other restaurants sharing the same lot.  My friend made reservations for our group and we got seated 20 minutes later than our reserved time which gave us time to pick what we want from the menu. We got seated and we've been ready to order but the 2 servers were not and some of us got asked for our orders twice, while the others in our group got completely skipped - lack of communication and coordination.  The servers read our orders back to us and everything was correct. I got the Whiskey River BBQ Burger no tomatoes (since it causes an anaphylactic reaction) with a side of onion rings A few minutes later they came out with our food. They were giving the wrong food to the wrong person. The server called out me food \"Whiskey River Burger no tomatoes with side of onion rings\" so I raised my hand to let them it was mine. And what did I get? A burger with tomatoes and a side of onion rings. I removed it from my burger and want going cause ruckus - I'm not a lawsuit-crazy type of person should I end up in the hospital but that's something they need to be very careful about.  A friend of mine is vegetarian so she ordered a veggie burger. They gave her a lettuce wedgie beef burger with bacon! The whole table waited for her to get the right burger but it never came and we were all famished. We were halfway done so my friend got up and talked to a different server about her order. When she got her food, we were done eating.  We were not offered refills on our drinks. We had to find random servers to get us fry refills. Ketchup bottles were empty. It was just terrible times.  Kids screaming and crying but it is a family restaurant so I can't complain about that.",

They re-made my burger and also remade my mother's so hers would not be cold waiting for mine to be remade & we could eat together. Not only is the service out of this world, but seriously the best turkey burgers / veggie burgers we have ever had! Working in the industry, I truly appreciate how you all went out of your way to create an experience for us both.  Thank you so much Shawna and the rest of the staff, you guys absolutely killed it!",

    "text": "We've been to Red Robin a handful of times and it just gets worse every time. For whatever reason, they remodeled the whole restaurant and took down all the cool movie posters they had on the walls. Even though there's less there, it feels more cluttered now. The tables are so close to each other that your basically sitting inches from the people next to you.  Usually, the food isn't horrible. I've always had a soft spot for their steak fries. When they're done right, they are so good and you can't beat the perk of \"bottomless\" fries. This time around I went with a new burger on the menu, the smoke and pepper burger. I don't know what they did but it was terrible. The first bite I took, I felt like I literally just ate a spoonful of salt. It wasn't very hot either and the bottom bun was soggy so I think it was sitting for a while.   We usually only come here when we have a group and no one can decide what to eat. It's been a while since we've been there so I can't be sure but I believe they raised their prices too. My burger was $14!!! Their service is always hit or miss too so hopefully it's a while before I get suckered into coming back!",

    "text": "Service was poor.  Food was awful.  Too bad we can't give zero stars!    Ordered a double burger and one of the patties was broken apart and split into several pieces - completely unappetizing.  (Wish I knew how to upload a picture of the deformed patty for all to see.)  To make matters even worse, when I pointed it out to the server and then the manager, I received a lukewarm response and a token apology.  They told me that they wouldn't charge for this second patty, but seemed completely oblivious to the unappealing and obnoxious appearance of the burger.  One would think that they would have, at the very least, offered to make another one.    Instead, they gave off the clear impression that this was not out of the ordinary or something atypical for them.  It seemed as if it was no big deal.  Scary and troublesome.  I wonder what their health department grades have been.    Suffice it to say that this was the last time my family and I will be dining there.",

    "text": "Sing it with me......REEED ROBIN.....YUM! ;)  Oohhh my goodness....my brain can't think because it is SOO LOUD IN HERE!  Now I remember why back in the days I would bring my baby here.  Because no matter how loud she screams no one notices. LOL  I think its so loud that you actually have to yell to communicate with the person you are with so its all an ugly vicious cycle.   Sunday afternoon we decided on a burger-lunch and thought it had been so long since we had been here.  Now we remember why. hahah The waiting area was full but must have been for a large party because our party of 2 got seated right away.  Every seat in this place was full.  Tons of large parties full of families and friends!  Maybe the after-church crowds as well.  So much I forgot about this place-not a frequent favorite just for the fact there aren't too many healthy options here.  If you can control yourself they do serve salads.  I'm just not sure how healthy they are since I'm not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantastic pictures enticing your blurred and echoing thinking.    We were literally seated for less than 5 minutes when our waitress came to apologize for the wait.  Wait?  What wait?  Very nice girl but a little ditsy.  I don't generally go for burgers anywhere.  I usually opt for the grilled chicken for a healthier choice.  Today I was going all out.  Here's what we ordered:  Whisky BBQ burger - slightly greasy bun, topped with a juicy on the inside burger with crispy onion strings and a smoky bbq sauce.  Yes I didn't go for the lowest in calorie/fat option.  It was pretty great though.  I had to cut it in fourths so I could actually eat it in a nice non-messy way.  My once a year indulgence didn't fail me...er-until just now.....SHOW STOPPER....  Might I say how disgusted I am now that I looked at the nutritional value of this burger....Oh my freakin gawd......1138 calories 70 grams of fat!  HOLY SHIT!  My hour workout that night didn't even put a dent in that!  (not even funny right now) Sniff sniff.....Tear.  to continue....BF ordered a regular cheese burger with mustard and crispy onion strings.  He said it was the best he's had in a long time.  He ordered a side of coleslaw and loved it.  ....and don't forget the \"bottomless steakfries\"...its what they advertise on TV.  ...and I am not even looking at the nutritional value of these! God help me here!  I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of steak fries but I ate a few anyway.  I've seen other reviews about the seasoning on the tables.  Nothing (at all) special to me.  The fries are dry anyway and the seasoning doesn't even stick.  So \"eh\" on the fries. Maybe I will substitute them next time-FOR SALAD (disgusted still).  BTW we didn't need bottomless as there were plenty that we didn't finish....Thank God!  Customer service is outstanding.  The manager checked on our table several times.  Drinks never ran low and our server was super attentive in the midst of her many other tables.  I am often amazed when someone can juggle all that and still be pleasant and attentive.  I know.  Yes agreed...that's how it should be.  Overall the place is fun, loud and perfect to bring your really boisterous family and friends to clog their arteries!  Enjoy THAT would ya!  =)",

    "text": "I have been dining at Red Robin at both here in Las Vegas and in Southern California since the mid 1990's. Over the years, little had changed. It was a family driven atmosphere with balloons, kitschy wall adornments, and a large fiberglass bird mascot in the dining room. Kids were welcomed with crayons and a small arcade. The kids menu was colorful and the menu was largely fried and burger based, and it was great.   Unfortunately, times have changed and Red  Robin is going through a \"modernization\" of sorts. Gone are all the movie posters and even the fiberglass bird mascot. Now it is trying to be hip, cool, sleek and modern. Even the balloons and crayons are gone. It is trying to be a higher end gourmet burger place that seem to be the trend in the USA. I am not happy about the change and miss the way it used to be.   On my last visit to the Red Robin in Centennial Center, the decor was modern boring. The kids menus were photocopied in black and white, and crayons were not offered. Service was not as quick as it used to be, though the food quality was the same as I remember.   Overall, I miss the old Red Robin. That pretty much sums it up.",

This is the 4th or 5th time at this location but wanted to write this review because the previous experiences were so so. This everything was great and credit to Sabrina. She was very attentive and filled drinks when needed and brought more fries a few times when necessary. That's the reason I'm writing this today because it needs to be recognized versus the negative from prior times. Anyway when I go back I'll always go to the bar area and hope for a similar experience. Everything was good and timely and no complaints at all",

So, we decided to sit in the bar and hangout a little longer.  There was ample seating in the bar and they had a booth that fit the 6 of us perfectly.  I wanted to get rid of my buzz and there is nothing better than a milkshake and fries to do that.  I ordered the cookie shake and it was great.  $5 for the shake and extra in the tin.  Our waitress was great too.  She checked up on us to make sure everything was okay.  The only problem I had with the place was the urinal.  It was about a foot off of the ground.  I think it's a test to see if you're sober or not.  If you piss on your shoes then you have to wait a little while longer before you can drive.  I was good to go!",

    "text": "I heart Red Robin!    This is a huge burger chain and they know what they are doing!  It isn't a fancy place, but it is a very toddler/kid friendly restaurant.  This is great since my mini me is very much a toddler and gets into everything these days.  It is a very comfortable place for families to go, as well as to grab a tasty burger!  The menu is mostly fantastic burgers, but it seems every time I go there are even more options like salads, chicken sandwiches, fish options, and even pastas.  I have only had the burgers and the fish n' chips and have loved every bite.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers, though my faves are the Beresker, A1, and the Bleu Ribbon burgers.  Yum, yum, yummy!  And a little bit of drool too.  Now for the best part about Red Robin....Bottomless Steak Fries!  The fries here are amazing, especially with the special Red Robin Seasoning.  I love these fries and probably eat at least half of my body weight in them every time I go to RR.    They also have a great loyalty card that you can sign up for.  Every 10th burger/entree you buy is free, you get a free burger during your birthday month, and you get a lot of freebies throughout the year.  And it is all free.  I love free!",

I tend to get the banzai burger, but I have tried the Ramen Burger (which was surprisingly tasty), and recently the Wedge Burger which is a protein style. I got the meat with no pink this time, which sadly I think does take away from a juicy flavor that is attained when there is pink in the meat.  They have a poutine which I've had twice. The first time wasn't too memorable, but recently had it and it seemed tastier. But definitely seems fattening!  Haven't gotten up the courage to get the bottomless steamed brocolli, but maybe one day..",

I wish that we had the opportunity to communicate whether we preferred to be seated at a regular table (my mom is handicapped) but again, they were busy!  My high top chair wobbled the entire time which was annoying, but our table was clean.  Our server was very sweet and attentive!  She checked on us several times throughout our visit and remembered everything. I noticed that they use a lot of team work and that there were a few others who came by to ensure everything was satisfactory as well.

Anyhow, they snagged us a spot at a booth with the baby in her car seat off to the side. I was scared of having her in the aisle with hot food and heavy plates passing by, so the manager promptly found us a different booth. Thank you kind sir . Our server was Malachi and he was SUPER friendly and on top of it! He took our orders right away, brought us some garlic fries a little early (which are totally worth the upcharge... do it), and got our orders in! We looked down at the time and realized we needed to get our baby bedtime routine on, so we had to leave early with our food to-go, and Malachi was genuinely concerned he had done something wrong. Anyhow, you did nothing wrong Malachi, you were absolutely wonderful!! The bruschetta chicken sandwich was delicious and my hubby got some burger with an egg in it.... he ate it in under a minute so that was also delicious.  Thank you Red Robin for rescuing me tonight!!!!! I was exhausted and soo did not want to cook.",

Apps are ranked by price point.   We went with the spinach artichoke dip. It came served with both chips and veggie sticks. It was huge and we couldn't finish it. Burgers came with bottomless fries, YUM. I went with the aforementioned Bleu Ribbon burger, but lettuce wrapped. I love that they have that option. T got a kids burger, which he ate all of.

I ordered from the \"tavern\" section of the menu??!!!??? WTH?  They always advertise these big juicy burgers, well, let me tell that the tavern menu equates to kids menu. At least for me it does. My burger was so small I was insulted. I also asked for chili cheese fries. What a joke. A couple of fries with some cold crusty chili, cold bacon, barely melted cheese and hair thin jalapeno slices on top.  To my knowledge, chili cheese fries don't have bacon. I gave them two stars because even though my burger was small, it was hot, somewhat juicy and tasty. But that's all I give them credit for. Very disappointing and unsatisfactory experience!",

We were seated almost immediately and our server came over shortly afterwards.   Prior to this visit I hadn't been to Red Robin for probably about 8 years lol no lie.. the menu has changed significantly since the last time I had remembered ordering. I wasn't really in the mood for a burger since I haven't been too big on beef lately. I went for one of the signature dishes beer battered Fish n Chips which was recommended by our server.   It was decent nothing to write home about I think she hyped the dish up more than what it really was. The fries though are amazing which is probably the reason they have the \"bottomless fries\" option. Service was a bit spotty but nothing too bad and the food was mediocre at best I even tried my moms chicken sandwich and that too wasn't anything special.. I guess a solid 3 Stars is fair..",

All were well prepared and very tasty.  From there we scarfed down a sampling of their burgers.  No problem there, Red Robin does some good burgers and endless fries.  The waitress was great!  She made sure we were all taken care of in a timely fashion.  The only issue on this visit was the table was wedged into the dining room and was very close to the booths around it, creating an issue for people getting into the booths.  Overall:  I recommend this place for their burgers.",

They always end up sitting us in the bar area and we always end up being forgotten about or our order comes out wrong.   This location gets very busy. There's been a long wait time every time we've tried to go. The bartender that was there was not the friendliest. He didn't come to check on us very much, we waited a long time to put in our order, get drinks, get our food, everything. He favors certain people and will sit there and talk to them instead of checking on the other people at the bar. We've sat in the booths in the bar area too, but no one ever comes to check on us. We're supposed to get bottomless fries and bottomless root beer floats, but by the time we got checked on, we were already done eating and frustrated that it took so long and nobody came around, that we just paid and left. I think we've tried coming here 3 or 4 times in the past few months and not once, did we have a good experience. We're definitely going to start looking for other burger places nearby.   For the food, I can't say that I've eaten anything here that made me want to come back. I've tried a few of their \"new\" burgers, but they're just ok. They're sweet potato fries are good and so are their garlic parm fries.",

Our server, Tina was fine and helpful.  After ordering it seemed a long time before our food came but they were busy which is why we were surprised that our food was barely warm.  The steak fries were soggy and limp.  My hamburger was not hot nor were the fries.  My husbands order was the same way.  Tina offered a replacement on the fries which we accepted but by the time they arrived we had eaten all our food, with the exception of the fries.  Tina sent the manager over but by that time we were through and she asked if we were in a \"better place\" now.  We told her we were fine just so we could pay and leave.  We won't put this Red Robin on our return list.",

Is it my imagination, or are the burgers tiny now?  For a double-patty hamburger, both our entrees were more along the size of a White Castle burger, the wife correctly pointed out.  We left the place after an appetizer, two beers and two burgers, and we were still hungry.  It was an oddly upsetting feeling.  And if you've been to a Red Robin lately, you've noticed the little tablet computers mounted at each table, that allow you to see menu items, pay your bill, play a little game and GET A $2 ENTERTAINMENT FEE added to your bill.  Yes, for the privilege of trouncing three anonymous strangers at a trivia game, I was charged an extra $2.  Mind you, there is NO warning about this charge when you play the game.  That is unacceptable.  Red Robin you are still a great place to eat, but you're walking a fine line with the mini burgers and the unannounced fees.  Hopefully you'll see the error of your ways.",

I guess a new tech feature...they'll text you once the table is ready. Nice.  Anyway, once we were seated, we waited a little bit before we even got cutlery for the table. I ordered my 3yr old meal first (it's just better that way) and our drinks.  10 monutes later, our waitress returned to take our orders.  I ordered the Marco Pollo. ( chicken sandwich). My husband ordered some Sriracha burger.  Ok, I was pumped for our food. It's burgers. Yummy right.  Nope. Nothing special. Mine kept falling apart. Annoying. And it really wasn't even tasty.  My husband said his..was just a burger. Not even my son had his.  Plus, they came back uhmmmm...never with \"bottomless\" fries. No water for the table.   So I'm sorry. Don't think I'll be dining here again. At least not for a couple years.",

I didn't like my drink I ask for strawberry lemonade . I've had it before and it usually taste sweeter.  This one was very sour it appear that they had just added strawberries on top to add to the sweetness but the strawberries looked old and dull not fresh . I  ask the bar tender to add sweetness to it . Her reply was I don't understand what your saying . Lemonade is sour . Seriously , anyways I ordered a Shirley  temple . It was still more soda than a combo  of cherry flavor. She didn't ask if the drink was better . I didn't say anything mind you the lemonade previously ordered sat in front of me the entire time I ate . Afterwards, she directed all her attention to my fiance without looking at both of us .  How professional is that? . I was looking forward to enjoying a nice meal after a long weekend and craving a nice burger but I will considered going back.  The food was good I don't think the burgers are worth $10 for a plate $1.50 xtra for onion rings that you only get a 4 count.  I'm always willing to treat myself when I feel it's worth the money .  Don't complain if you want great service at the bar ..",

We say please, and thank you to the server and he just ignores us and walks away. Granted, he was very busy but still, a smile goes a long way.

I sent that back, don't eat pink meat !!!!!! my friend ordered chicken wrap, that is also much smaller, with no flavor and icky chopped up teeny chicken, lots of lettuce though ! avoid this place at all costs ! waste of money :(",

Without blowing my cover, Im posting this on behalf of the staff who went above and beyond for a disabled customer to ensure that she made it onto the transit system safely. The two young gents were even willing to foot the $50 dollar cab ride home for her, but that wasnt necessary as she ended up taking public transportation home. One of the guys even pushed her scooter all the way to bus stop! (I think it was like two miles or more!) Wow.. nice to know that there are some good  people still left in this world. I promised em I would write them a review so here it is!",

It was cooler outside, but waiting outside meant I couldn't hear when it was our turn to be seated. Some buzzing remote things (what are they called?) would have been nice. Even Fazoli's has those.  The burger was delicious. I asked for \"a little bit of red,\" and I was a bit concerned by how red the meat actually was. I haven't died yet, so I guess it was safe.  Their \"bottomless fries\" weren't. Over the course of the meal, we were given a total of 2 baskets of fries, and the baskets were about 1/3 full. We are a family of 4, and my kids wondered where all the promised fries were. When we asked for more, they never came. The fries were overdone and bland anyway, so I guess having more wouldn't have made me much happier.  I'm not planning on coming back.",

    "text": "I just can't with this place any more.  Red Robin used to be a fun family place, then they tried to make it upscale and got rid of the games, kids coloring pages, large balloons, fun posters etc....  I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.  In my opinion, Red Robin turned their backs on their customer base by trying to upgrade and make it more adult. I would never go there with all adults and it's not really fun for kids anymore.  Thanks but no thanks.",

I should have checked the order before leaving when I picked it up but it was beyond packed and bartender seemed over whelmed that I just wanted to grab my food and go. Once I got home we noticed he order was wrong. The burger with no onion had onion. The burger w pineapple no pineapple. We got regular friends when we paid for cheese fries. We were so hungry we just made it work anyways. That night I was in horrible stomach pain. I wasn't able to sleep good. Next day I woke up feeling like I was catching a cold, I was hot then cold the next minute w sharp stomach pain/ cramps... I wasn't hungry for any food all day. I stayed in bed literally from morning to night, when my sister came over to check on me she said she had the same symptoms and it was from this food. Something was off. I have never felt like this before. She gave me a few tips to feel better and next day I was 50% better. I don't think I'll ever eat there again, worst food poisoning ever.",

    "text": "Well I decided to give this place a go, I am glad that I did! First off they have great service and are very friendly, we got seated immediately as we were over 21 and went to the bar area. We got the short stack of onion rings (6 rings) and was a lot for me and my lady. The ranch and \"secret\" sauces are great compliments to the onion rings which were hot, crispy, and a good flavor. I had the collossus burger with fries and my lady had the bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger substitute and broccoli.  Its great to see that red robins offers the likes of BOCA burgers and gardenburgers as substitutes at no extra cost!  The wait was minimal and the food arrived hot. The steak fries are awesome and the broccoli was also great, especially being bottomless made it all that much better! My burger (collossus) had a burger, brisket, grilled onions, and two types of sauces from what I was reading and it was great! Nice burger flavor, the brisket was tender (could have used a little more brisket but great non the less) the onions were sweet and caramelized to greatness. The colossus was a definite win!! My ladies bleu ribbon burger with a BOCA burger was awesome!! The BOCA tasted very mild compared to a regular burger so the flavors of the supporting ingredients (onions straws, steak sauce, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomatoes, and bleu cheese) really stood out and had a big taste profile which would almost been forgotten with a regular beef burger. It has been 6+ yrs since ive had red robins and im glad to say that the product is the same and they still have great burgers. Give five guys, in-n-out, and carls jr a break and head on over and see what you think as I hope your experince will be as good as mine!",

They brought me a burger covered in a sauce I clearly asked for on the side, then charged me extra for the sauce I didn't want.   When I asked them to fix my meal, all they did was take the burger back to the kitchen and wipe the sauce off with a napkin. The worst part of that is not only the napkin debris on my burger, but they didn't get all the sauce off. It was terrible.  We were supposed to get \"bottomless fries\" and my wife went her whole meal without getting fries. They put 6-7 fries on her plate initially then we waited about 15 minutes before we had to chase down the ever so rude waitress and ask her if we could have more fries.   My daughters mac&cheese looked more like soup than mac&cheese.  Terrible service from our waitress Holly T. and the food sucked as well. They did nothing to fix my situation or make sure I was satisfied as a customer.  On top of the rude service, wrong order and dirty looks from the staff, I was overcharged on my bill.  We came here a few times a while back and it was ok, but now we will not be back to this place, ever. I do not recommend this place to anyone.   Save your time and money.",

The entire floor in that section of the restaurant was covered in garbage. There were 4 tables that sat with dirty dishes for at least 30 minutes.   Our waitress that we started with told us that she was being sent home. But she stayed and served the table next to us for the remainder of the night. Our waitress was good, and the food was good, which is the only reason they got 2 stars. The bathrooms were also filthy and the trash probably had not been emptied in hours.   The guy I saw bussing tables did half a table and then left to do God knows what. My husband (who loves Red Robin food as much as I do) said we likely won't be going back.

    "text": "Red Robin is a family favorite for us. I am a fan because they have a nice menu selection and they always seem to move quickly from the initial wait to be seated, if there is one at all, to getting your food. I also like that they have had the same menu since forever, so you always know what to expect, and then of course, you just can't beat bottomless steak fries! My hubby always orders a basket of fries right when we are seated and then he just keeps them coming! This always keeps the kids busy and happy and it beats having to order an appetizer! I will say, I do miss the old baskets and the way they would wrap the burgers, not so much down with the new motif of everything now, but the food is still the same so I can let it slide.  Another bonus is having the Rewards card because you get a point every time you order a meal, and at 10 points you get a free meal. That adds up really quickly. Plus you get a free meal on your birthday and you can register the kids for free birthday meals too, and that's not to mention all the bonus coupons and freebies they email you!   Plus R.R. is originally from Seattle and I always say everything amazing comes from Washington State :-)",

Good selection of appetizers and for BF sake, had to order the short tower of onion rings which arrived right after our cold beers. Mmm, crunchy and steaming hot.  BF had the Prime Chophouse burger with horseradish sauteed mushrooms and I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger with onion straws. I like how the server asked if we wanted \"no pink or some pink\" on the beef, easier than figuring out medium vs well done.  Our burgers were great looking and fabulously tasty. The steak fries were sizable planks,  lightly crisped, delicious sides. They'll bring more if you request,  but one serving was more than enough for each of us.  Oh so full.  Did we stop there? Ohellno, we ordered the Freckled Strawberry Lemonade cake to go, but after just a little try (betcha can't eat just one), we ate it all up ... nothing left to go! Light lemony cake, simmered strawberries on the side topped with whipped cream turned out to be something we couldn't resist. We will wander back here on another lazy Sunday to try other burgers, especially since they have NFL games on nearby screens.",

Being from California , there were a couple of them around us and we frequented them many times.  I have to say , the red robin here in Vegas , is a let down.     The service has been great both times we have come here , friendly staff and even the manager has come by to chat with us both times as well. This is fine and dandy , but service needs to be good along with the food , and that's where i had to lose some points on.   The first stop i ordered the new \"special\" which is the big bacon burger. I asked for BBQ sauce on the side , medium cooked burger.  My wife ordered the patty melt well done ...    When we received the burgers , they were opposite.  My wife received the medium and i received the well done.  We could have sent them back , but at that point we just wanted to eat ( we had an appointment to get to ).  The well done burger for me... had way to much char flavor.   The second time my wife ordered the same thing , well done again ... came out medium.  The place was packed and it took quite a while to get our food , so once again sending it back was not an option.  I was not in the mood for a burger that night so i tried the fish and chips along with a side of their clam chowdah ! .  The chowdah! was actually quite tasty , thick and had nice sized chunks of clams in it.   4 star .  However the fish .....  dry , tasteless , and the breading was not fully cooked through.

Another plus - the meals are served on plates - not a basket. Give it another try if you haven't.",

I usually like beer cheese but this one was overly beery. Not good. I got the a1 burger. The bun was a joke. Ice cold and hard.

The fries delivered with the actual meal were soggy my friends BLTA that came on a croissant was rock hard & tasted stale. The chicken fingers were dry.

He's never been sick from the food, which tells us they take great care in preparing his food. Above that, we used the burger bar catering tonight for our sons 21st birthday party. We are SO IMPRESSED with EVERYTHING! they don't miss one detail. You customize your protein (beef, turkey, chicken, veggie) then your bun type(gluten free, lettuce wrapped, sesame bun, ciabatta) and cheese type. They come wrapped in full foil/paper sheets to keep everything warm and like 12 toppings (bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos, pineapple, salsa, guac, mushrooms, fried onion straws, etc) a full bottle of teriyaki, bbq, aioli sauce, ketchup and packets of mayo and mustard. You can make almost any burger on their menu. It also comes with a huge container if fresh potato chips, plates and cutlery and napkins and tongs for each garnishment. Seriously can't say enough great things. It was SO worth the reasonable price to not have to grocery shop, stress out on prepping, grilling, cutting, mixing and cleaning up. We will use this service again and again!",

So I asked someone for more chips and it took another 10 minutes. Still no food. They never give you silverware. You have to ask for it. So we asked for utensils. Now the girl comws to me with chicken tortilla soup. And when I tell her no, she looks at me like I am dumb. But, still no food. So we havr been sitting here for over 40 minutes without food. Then the woman comes by and removes all of the sugar from the table. . that is pretty random. Oops they are coming with our food. So about 60 minutes to get 2 burgers, a salad, and a kids chicken strips. Smh.   Ok we are done. I ordered the southwestern salad with the sauce on the side. I get the salad and there is sauce on the side and sauce on the chicken breast. I have digestive issues and can not have allof the sauce on it. So I attempt to eat it because I am tired of asking for service because the waiter disappeared about 30 minutes ago. So I do not eat the salad and right when we are about to leave a woman comes by and asks how is everything. I am say terrible. I tell her about the salad and she tells me that she will put in anothet salad and make sure that it is correct. Then the manager came over and was kind enough to remove my salad from the bill. But the manager was dealing with the people in the booth behind me because their food was ruined too. Then, the server reappears. Huh. He was gone for almost an hour and apologizes for his absence. SMDH. I don't know I am supposed to tip because the server did nothing except take the order and bring us to go containers.   This seems to be the norm. The last time I was there we had to ask the server 3 times for silverware. And this is all while we had our food. And before that the waiter had a horrendous attitude and was huffing and puffing and rolling his eyes. We had to call the manager and I still tipped him. My oldest was just saying that today. You tip anyone because that guy was crazy ;(",

At 7pm we asked why the three tables who arrived after us, ordered after us already had there food and we did not?  Told the manager would come and speak to us. 10 minutes later the manager arrived with the food (which was cold) he never said a word about it taking so long to arrive. Then when we were done with our meal a Birthday Sunday was delivered to the birthday girl. Oh my! It had either been salted or the whip cream was spoiled.  The quote from the 5 y/o \"that's like the worst ice cream ever\".  The manager should have been busy helping serve but he sat at a table visiting one person most of the time we were there. I would not recommend this establishment until some changes are made.",

She kept going.... anyway. Icalled it to her attention again saying. \"Excuse me... we are both veterans. Can you show me what page that menu is in so I can choose too?\" Ignored again. Then was served wings that were still frozen. At this time the waitress felt bad enough to send the manager out to \"take care of it and address it. The manager came out apologized and offered us \"fries while you wait for your other food.\" Mind you, fries are \"bottomless\" aka  \"Free\" with our meals. I said no, we already have some coming. Then our food came out. My fries were from the bottom alright. The bottom of the fry basket. They were crunchy fry bits with pieces of regular fries and steak fry bits for more than 60% of the serving. The waitress came back again. I showed/told her what I got and that I was highly disappointed. She sent the manager back out who then acknowledged the Bad fries, apologized and then offered more fries! And then stated \"don't worry, we took care of your burgers and discounted he rest of your bill. I told her that our burgers were already free being that we are BOTH veterans. We got our bill and guess big surprise!! Only my husband's burger was taken off (because he's obviously the only veteran) with a military discount on the test of our meal. I should also state that my wallet was on the table with my military ID showing while speaking to the manager and waitress. Yes, little black women can serve too! Not saying it was about race but Jesus!! Get it together!!!!! They straightened out the bill with my husband because I couldn't bare to sit there for anymore BS! Never going back to this location again! Never did they offer a free dessert or to take care of the tab after such bad service. The waitress honestly outside of ignoring what I was saying (possibly just not hearing me) wasn't the problem. In the end she grites to work with whatever she could seem to do I guess but this place/management needs to pull their head out! This was our second time ever. First time amazing! This time . Never going back!",

    "text": "This was my very 1st time here. I have to say I did enjoy everything. The food was great but the service was crap. I would go back as long as I could have a different server.  For starters, I ordered a chili cheeseburger and bottomless fries and my friend order a bacon cheeseburger with the bottomless fries. The burger was good but messy, that's expected with a chili burger though. I liked the flavor of the burger and the chili. My friend enjoyed her burger too.  The fries could have had more seasoning but it was nothing the house seasoning salt mixture couldn't fix. I like the bottomless fries idea. They were hot and fresh and the just kept coming and coming.  We didn't order an appetizer because there was too much to choose from. The waitress asked if we wanted some fries while we waited. That was cool! I much rather have fries over bread.  Now back to the beginning, the waitress took forever to get to us. She walked past use multiple times and most times she didn't make Eye contact. She kept saying, one moment guys. This was even before we ordered drinks.  After about 10 minutes, she came over and took our drink order. She then left again. She came back after just a couple minutes and dropped off our drinks. We were ready to order, but she said, \"one minute guys.\" She kept passing us over and over. She was taking orders for other tables. Then she put their orders in and came back to us.  She asked if we wanted appetizers. We told said, \"No\" and then she asked if we just wanted some fries. We said, \"yes\" to the fries and it only took a couple minutes to get them. She sat them down and was off again. She came back after 3 or 4 minutes and thanked us for our patients.  We ordered and it took us maybe 7 or 8 minutes to get our burgers. We wanted more fries within that timeframe, but the waitress went missing again. We just had to wait until the food came out. It took us like 12-15 minutes to eat and she didn't stop by not one time.  I thought I was being smart when I used the machine thingy on the table to request that the waitress stop by. I felt so stupid when she passed us time after time, even though the red light was flashing on the machine. Also, while waiting, we decided to order some dessert. I ordered using the machine, since the waitress was no where to be found.  She finally stopped by. I asked if I had ordered correctly and she looked through the machine, turned off the blinking light and told me yes, my dessert order was in. I asked for more fries at that time, and I didn't see her again until she brought the fries and dessert out, at the same time, it took maybe 6 minutes. We finished everything and got the hell out of there.  Like I mentioned before. The food was good, but the service was hell.  Fix it Red Robin!!!",

Our server was Tony and he made the evening enjoyable.  He was very attentive and personable.  With the crew yesterday, I would gladly return to this location.",

I was with my daughter, foreign exchange student and adorable granddaughter. She was arguably not as adorable as she could be that evening as she was very hungry.  Our server, a very polite young man, promptly brought her chocolate milk.  As he set down in front of her he mentioned that he would bring two baskets of bottomless fries.  My granddaughter knows that word and what it means. We didn't see him again after that.  We felt as if we were in the frozen tundra and fries would never be coming our way. I took my granddaughter to the front of the restaurant to get a free balloon and walk around the foyer and came back. No fries. Eventually I saw our server and flagged him down. I asked him for crackers, fries, anything. . .   He was apologetic and kind and brought fries.  They came at the same time as our entrees.  My granddaughter had the grilled cheese sandwich that came with fries.  She picked one up and immediately let fall back to the plate because it was hot.  That seemed acceptable and normal, but when I picked up my fries from my cod burger they were not hot.  I immediately began feeding her my fries.  I didn't get to eat my cod burger until we got home but I really liked it.   The fries were not as good as I remember them.  There were a lot of thin fries and they just didn't taste very fresh.  That is the only thing I was disappointed in.  The server just seemed overwhelmed.",

    "text": "The service here is absolutely incredible. I was seated right away around 4PM Christmas Eve evening.  Right away I was given a menu and an order for my beverage. The server told me about their rewards program and how to use the Ziosk module at the table. The Ziosk can be utilized to order drinks, desserts, shakes, and even call the server when the server is not present. It can also be used to pay the bill with a credit/debit card, and even has gaming capabilities for 1.99.  I started off with the shorter stack of onion rings that came with ranch and what tasted like BBQ ranch for dipping. I was given 6 onion rings, all of which were not too hot but satisfyingly warm. The only thing I did not enjoy would be that the onion rings were too large to dip into the dipping cups, so I would either have to cut them with the knife or fold them. Other than that, the onion rings were flavorful and easily some of the best onion rings I have had in a while.  I ordered a grilled caesar salad, which did not have a picture in the menu, so I would think that it would be a chopped up salad with croutons and dressing. However, what I was served was a medium-small head of romaine lettuce cut in half what was lightly oiled and grilled with a slice of lemon. The halves of lettuce were garnished with dressing and Parmesan cheese. The crouton was a bias-cut piece of French bread that was toasted. My first thoughts were, \"How am I supposed to eat this?\" Initially, I ate the salad with a fork and knife, but found it easier to just grab the root of the lettuce and munch away. Not a bad taste at all! It was something that I was not expecting but was still satisfying.  The Nacho Crunch Tavern Burger was a great burger, but it did not live up to its name. Not once did I have a \"crunch\" while eating this burger. For a moment while consuming this burger, I wondered if they had given me the correct order. I upgraded my fries to garlic Parmesan fries; did not taste garlic nor Parmesan. The extra upgrade only made the fries dryer. I had another order of the same fries and they still tasted dry. Not as much flavor as I had expected.  For dessert, my server gave me the birthday sundae for free after asking me if I like ice cream. This was rather nice, I thought. The only downside would be that the spoon used for the sundae  could not touch the bottom of the sundae bowl; I ended up scooping the chocolate at the bottom with my the tip of my knife. I also had the Freckled Lemonade cake, which was very sweet and full of flavor. It was so sweet it almost gave me a headache, however. It was still quite delicious and totally embodied the essence of their Freckled Lemonade. One thing I would like to say would be that I order the cake through the Ziosk, but it did not come until I had asked for it.  This was a very memorable experience. It was not perfect at all, but from how I was treated, it makes me want to come back for another visit. Red Robin is an excellent restaurant. Their service has dramatically changed from when I first visited them years ago. Although the food was not as good as I thought would be, the service was incredible. I'm sure if I come again I would give them their fifth star. Come to Red Robin for an unforgettable, gourmet burger experience!",

    "text": "It's just OK for a burger place, pretty much right in the middle.  Mainly visited Red Robin since we hadn't been there in quite a while.  With so many burger joint options out there you can see why!  Red Robin does offer some tasty options though on their updated menu.  Wifey ordered their beast of a burger, the A.1. Peppercorn - gourmet burger topped with hardwood-smoked bacon, pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, tomatoes, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun.  Sucker comes with a steak knife skewered right through it!  Wifey liked it, except she's still not a big onion fan, even if they come battered and fried.  I took a bite and thought it was good, the A.1. peppercorn spread having just enough bite & tang to go with the spicy pepper-jack cheese.  Onion straws gave it great texture, the tomato added some freshness, and the bacon was nice & salty.  I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double - double patty combo of ghost pepper sauce, pepper-jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and fried AND fresh sliced jalapenos!  The Tavern burgers are known as their 'value' menu burgers, they are a smaller patty on a smaller bun.  So this burger even though small, packed quite a bite!  The ghost pepper sauce had a real big kick, but not so hot that you wouldn't enjoy eating your burger.  The fried jalapenos were a nice contract in texture, and went along great with the fresh jalapenos.  Tis spicy!     Of course at Red Robin the big appeal is their dang Bottomless Fries that come with each burger you order.  All you can eat baby!  Carbs be damned!  Now you actually have your choice of bottomless steak fries, sweet potato fries, or BROCCOLI.  Yep folks, broccoli.  And I, as your fearless Yelp Elite, went this route.  Wifey got steak fries so I could always share with her.  Me?  Wanted to cut back on them calories so I opted for the green.  But beware!  That broccoli serving comes in a measly bowl which may have only 5-6 florets of broccoli in them.  I literally ordered 6 servings of broccoli throughout the course of my burger.  SIX!  It was actually yummy, steamed, then with a sprinkle of Red Robin seasoning by yours truly.  I will say this, too much broccoli will make you burp (from both ends).  Overall not a bad meal, par for the course of a burger chain.  But Red Robin burgers are a bit pricey, wifey's set me back near $12, and mine was around $9.  Most times I would rather opt for a burger joint like In N Out or Five Guys.  Save money, save calories!  Okay, with Five Guys fries...maybe not.  MMMMM....beefy.",

We have not been in this Red Robin for quite a few years and met family here for dinner with a little trepidation due to  the very bad food and terrible service we had. But I must say that we had a wonderful meal and terrific service! The Crispy Chicken Salad and it was huge ( had enough left over for lunch ), endless fries were consistently kept full. My husband really liked his Ghost Tavern burger, and his raspberry ice tea was like he makes it at home. What I appreciated was the fact that both the Chef Supervisor and the Manager both stopped by tables to make sure the guests were happy. I highly recommend coming in and when you do ask for Shindena.",

Yes, at Red Robin you get unlimited steak fries but when we wanted more, our server was no where to be found.  We got the Royal (cheese burger with egg), and it was ok but nothing special. The egg was too underdone so it made a mess.  Also got the Prime Chophouse which comes with onions strings, horseradish grilled mushrooms, steak sauce (too sweet, tasted like bbq sauce) and provolone. Both ordered with a bit of pink, but the meat wasn't very flavorful and the patties not that thick. The Chophouse also is really rich and hard to finish.  First time to Red Robin, not impressed and probably won't be back. But if you want to try, sign up for their bday club and get a free burger for your birthday.",

    "text": "Had a not so good experience at Red Robin on Tropical Parkway last night.  Got there around 4:30 and were told there would be maybe a 15 minute wait for a table for 2.  Not a problem.  The wait time was pretty accurate.   Our server was at our table within a minute to take our drink order and food order since we knew what we were getting.  We both ordered cheeseburgers...and then we waited.  Our server came by and asked if we were doing ok....we said sure....we had our beverage so that was good, but nothing else.  FINALLY our burgers are served and as I was going to move the fries to add come ketchup, I realized the fries were just luke warm.  We asked for mustard and when the server who brought out the food came back I mentioned that the fries weren't hot.  She quickly brought us fresh, hot fries.  We had not touched the burger yet but quickly realized that the burgers were just warm and not hot.  By this time we'd been there for a while and just wanted to eat and get on with our evening. So the burger....I have a few complaints...while it was cooked like we asked, the cheddar cheese was almost melted away completely, the buns seem to be served right out of the bag they come in (I prefer them to be either grilled a bit or warmed), I don't think they put any of their relish on the sandwich and it was like eating a cold sandwich.   Earlier when we were trying to decide where to go for dinner, we picked Red Robin because it was closer to where we were going after dinner, but wish we would have driven the few miles farther and gone to 5 Guys.  They toast the buns and the burger is served immediately, making it still hot to touch when you start to eat.   This visit was not what I expected from Red Robin...very disappointed!",

I do think they are a bit understaffed as the servers, though friendly always seem to be incredibly stressed and out of breath. Even though we order our dessert on the tablets that are on each table, we still have to place the dessert order as soon as we receive our burgers, or else we will be waiting for at least 10 minutes after we are finished. -1 point for that and the 20 min wait to be seated.

My girlfriend ordered the new BBQ pork burger with a side of regular steak fries. Her daughter ordered a kids pizza and a side of fries.   It took a while to get our food but not terribly long. None the less both my fries and my girlfriends fries were cold but we were so hungry we just decided to eat them. My girlfriends daughter didn't get her pizza at least 15-20 minutes after we received our meals. So Cassandra offered to bring her out some fries while we waited. By the time her pizza came out my food along with my girlfriends was cold as well.   When we first ordered our meals we asked for 2 sauces for my girlfriend and myself. It took us asking Cassandra 3 additional times to finally get some dipping sauce 20 mins after receiving our already cold food.   My girlfriend was not pleased with her BBQ pulled pork burger. It came with pickles after she asked Cassandra to have them removed. And I never received my garlic herb fries. Over all this was a tough Sunday evening experience, I'm moving to this area and I really hope this isn't the normal service because this is my is one of my family's favorite places to eat.",

The food is consistently ok, not great/not horrible = pretty good. Lots of gimmicks, pay at the table kiosk, endless/bottomless one thing or another.  We were there at least an hour prior to closing on a Monday night. You would have thought they'd been closed for an hour. There were still people there, but all the servers were busy doing side work/trying to get out of there. We felt rushed even prior to closing. Service was adequate; not overly friendly. I'll be back, just not very soon.",

We approach the host and we are told they are cleaning our table.  We finally sat down. This is crazy. We never had bad service like this before. Need training on how to defuse upset customers. Know what impacts happen when the order of placement will trigger upset customers who had been waiting like everyone else and get bumped to customers who arrive after you.",

    "text": "What can I say, Red Robin is delicious! However, if you want to use delivery set your expectations low. The last time we ordered delivery we got a call from grub hub saying that our order wasn't correct (it was missing a meal) and that the restaurant was making it now. Well eventually our delivery got to us and everything except the meal that they had to correct was ice cold. Obviously they made the meal while the other items sat in a bag. We called grub hub and the restaurant right away and they refunded the cost of the cold meals well guess what? We open the container for the only hot meal we received and it was WRONG. LOL it was funny and not funny at the same time and wasn't even worth calling back about. Fast forward to tonight and we place an order. 30 min later our grub hub driver is nice enough to call and say that our order is still not ready at Red Robin. We say it's cool bc we know it's a holiday weekend. Order arrives and again it's WRONG. Blatantly missing items. All that being said the food was good. That's why it's unfortunate because this is poor management not poor quality. Anyway, from now on we will probably pick the order up ourselves.",

First, the host, an adorable little blond girl, was super sweet. When another person forgot my fries, she was all over making it it right. I'm allergic to citric acid, and Kati is one of the few who knew what that meant. She forgot to request no salsa on my burger (tomatoes=citric acid) but this doesn't make me think any less of her. She immediately took accountability for forgetting and got me a new burger, even though I forgot to request no salsa. Then, there was a hair in my food. But the manager immediately took care of that too. So mind you, my experience didn't go smoothly but it was handled perfectly. They were crazy busy and Kati was the only bar tender for the entire restaurant and she owned it. Response, fast, and still kept up with her own tables. People don't appreciate people like her as much as they should!",

Upon returning she stated, sorry we are all out of silverware, and that they were washing so it would be a few minutes. Needless to say, we were shocked. When I told her I had no choice but to eat my coleslaw first, she said she would go clean some and bring it to me. We promptly got up and notified the manager and left. I did not care to trust that the waitress wouldn't just grab some utensils and wipe them off and bring them to us. We are still in shock that a restaurant would actually run out of silverware!  We were also extremely disappointed at the \"new\" look. It was too much like a bar atmosphere for us. There was nothing we would ever want to go back to concerning this Red Robin.",

So I compile our overall impressions herewith.  He was pleased with his $12.99 french dip that came w/ garlic fries.  The parental units had a $9.79 jamaican jerk chix burger & a $9.59 bacon burger.  Both came with the fat steak fries.  All was ok.  That's why it's 4 not 3.",

    "text": "Had a complaint to file spoke with the Annette, General Manager, and then Andreas, the kitchen manager, the second time about my food. Annette had no customer service skills what so ever. She literally acted like she was on some kind of drug or really nervous where she couldn't speak fluently. She made excuses for her kitchen's hour and 20 minute wait time and when the food came out, it was half cold. Either she has no control over her kitchen or she just doesn't know anything about the kitchen where she trust Andreas too much. When I finally got her to let me speak with he kitchen manager, he hardly knew English. I had to repeat myself at least 4 times for him. He told me it was just a Thursday and that the waits always like this. Yet I'm a regular and never had I had to wait 1 hr and 20 minutes. I asked if they needed more cooks or at least better cooks but hey said they need to hire more people because they're low on staff. That's not an excuse at all, I have a friend that works there and says they won't hire anyone else to save labor, and the people they do hire quit within a week. So either the GM can't run her store, or the assistant/kitchen manager is using his authority to benefit himself and possibly the same for Annette. I've dealt with businesses like this and the number one goal is saving money, no matter the cost to the customer or to food quality. Exactly what's going on at this location. If the employees got a lawyer, I know they could win big time with how the management functions. Even in small claims court if they get the evidence themselves.",

    "text": "My brother took me here last week for my birthday, prior to this visit the last time I ate at a Red Robin was well over 12 years ago. The southwest burger, forget what it was called, was absolutely delicious. The beef patty was a man sized portion, it was juicy meat and everything seemed so fresh. The waitress forgot a couple things, but was absolutely on top of everything with quick service and a bright positive attitude. I will visit back this location on a regular basis, I can't believe I neglected eating here for this long.",

    "text": "DISGUSTED! This location has taken a turn for the worst. First off, the tables were so sticky it felt like somebody washed them in syrup. 3 out of the 6 of us didnt have napkin,spoon or fork when they sat us down. When we got our strawberry lemonades, they tasted so sour and salty. Very disappointed because we love the strawberry lemonade here. So, he brings out the so called \"bottomless fries\". THE 2 BASKETS OF FRIES HAD 8 FRIES INSIDE OF THEM EACH. MAYBE 9 AT THE MOST. So after we quickly make the 16-18 french fries disappear, we ask our waiter for more fries and refills on our drinks. He then refills our lemonades (that taste even worse than the previous glasses) and brings out 2 more baskets of bottomless fries. This time the baskets have 7 fries each now. And thats the last time we see our waiter. We get our food from different servers. 10 minutes after we recieve our food, the waiter brings us the bill without even asking us if we were going to have dessert. Very poor  customer service. Staff was just out riight horrible.   We werent even done with our food and he drops the bill on us. My brother ordered bottomless rootbeer floats and had to track down the waiter to get his refill. Now mind you, its 8pm on a Wednesday night. Its not even busy, and we were 6 of the 20 people who were in the place. Will never go back. As for the other 5 of the party, they also have let me know they will never go back. Sad.",

    "text": "I admit this review is about a week old but I wanted to leave it in regards to their To-Go service! Last Friday, I was too lazy to cook or go out-out and was craving a burger so I called this location and placed a To-Go order over the phone. When I arrived I told the hostess I was picking up and she sends me to the bar. So I go to the bar and he tells me to go to the hostess and ask for Sabrina. So then I go back to the silly girl and say hey I guess I'm looking for Sabrina and she gives me the homer simpson \"doh\" face and I assume she just might be new and still learning. Sabrina then confirms my order for me, asks for my loyalty card and makes my freckled lemonade to-go fresh! As much as I was in a hurry it did make me happy that my drink was fresh and not sitting there for 10 minutes. The transaction was smooth and of course I couldn't help but tip her for giving such great customer service! If you ever go to this location you better hope Sabrina is working otherwise you might be screwed haha",

    "text": "My family & I have been to this RR several times and have never had a complaint about their customer service, it's always been top notch......however tonight there was kinda a hiccup. The hostess who sat us was none to happy to be at work tonight. To start she didn't greet us as she led us to our table, didn't say two words, then she sat us at a dirty table. We asked her to wipe it down and she did but left it so wet that my husband had to flag her down and ask her for some napkins so we could dry it. She brought us the napkins and still did not say two words to us. Both my husband and I found it upsetting since we've never had any customer service issues at this location. At our first opportunity we asked to speak to the manager, he came promptly and we discussed our concerns with him. He understood our issues, promised us that he would coach the young lady offered to give us 25% off our meal, which we didn't ask for or expect, we were still planning on eating there we just wanted the problem to be addressed with her. He delivered our dinner himself, checked on us several times, even stopped and chatted and then told us he would take care of our entire bill!!! Needless to say we were shocked!  It was totally unexpected. The manager, Jim, and the server, Ashley, did an excellent job of turning a bad experience into a great one!",

The price was outrageous just for a burger (which were small-had to get my grandson a second one) fries and a drink.  We would of been better off at Steiner's were on Wednesday,s they have burgers with fries for $6.00 a person and other specials on different nights.  Carl,s $6.00 burgers are even bigger and better.  Save some money and go someplace else unless you like paying high prices for mediocre burgers.",

    "text": "Dang Me. Red Robin is all growed up! Hadn't been to one in 20yrs.  But a lot of the clientele, at this location anyways, hasn't. The majority maybe have their drivers license, maybe. (Families w/ kids. Lot's of families) But there I was, the biker couple, the lesbian couple, the funny retired couple, even my nextdoor neighbors (with their new born) were there. You too could be there!  Sunday late lunch, early dinner.  Sit in one of the 5-6 booths in the Bar Area! Much calmer. There is also the bar itself. 3-4 TV's for \"The Game\" so you can hang out and scarf your burger and beer (or cocktail). I recommend the 22oz. draft beers. They also have a couple \"Bottomless\" non-alcoholic Limeade drinks. All you want for $3.99.    Stuffed! The folks I was with are eaters, and still the portions did their duty. Chips w/ warmed Artichoke & Spinach dip. Towering Onion Rings served like a Fisher / Price toy. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fisher-price.com%2Fimg%2Fproduct_shots%2F71050_d_1.jpg%3F1216605372668&s=b4237207ad314f17d975ed0e8b8407a7a6e8c63499b7ea2006445802a67e064b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fisher-price.com/img/pro...</a>  Ahhhh 'comfort food\". Burger was fine. Bun was a bit hard. I scarfed it. But it is a $9 burger, could be better.   Didn't get into it. But I hear the steak fries are endless, as in All you Can Eat.  And then the dessert menu arrives. NO WAY!! Next time.  Red Robin. A higher end Applebee's. If that means anything. The crew did a fine job! Cooking and presentation were great. Service was genuine and attentive. They did take care of us. Probably will of you too. Hours: Sun-Thu: 11a-10p, Fri-Sat: 11a-11p  3 starts because of the service! The kid crowd almost lost that 3rd star though.  Take 95 to W. Ann.  West of 95, first turn is Centennial Center Blvd. up aways Cross W. Tropical Pkwy, continue about 50yards turn left. Red Robin is off to the left back side of lot. The roads out here are a work in progress. These directions should be fine though.  Enjoy.",
