The noodle pulling was definitely impressive although the pulled noodles had a harder texture than I preferred.  The popular beef noodle broth was not as hearty as I preferred but the brisket in the dish was excellent. We also ordered the beef friend rice and pork dumplings which were very flavorful. Next time I will try the knife shaved noodles for a softer and more doughier texture solely based on preference since the pulled noodles were harder than I liked.",

We came here because of yelp review, we order Beef Frank, Spicy wonton & Beef pancake for Stater, we're so honey.  The food was great & service is wonderful & friendly.  We're also ordered pork belly noodles & Shang Noodles, I like Shang noodle better.  I will come back for sure.",

    "text": "I came in on a Saturday night and the restaurant was around 2/3 full. We were able to be seated at the last table before having to go with the bar.  We ordered shang beef noodle, dandan noodle, tomato/egg rice and the beef potsticker.  Shang beef noodle was my favorite of the night. The soup had a lot of flavor and the meat tasted good. However it still didn't taste like the beef noodle that I used to have back in Taiwan.  Tomato egg rice tasted like any tomato egg rice you can make at home. But then I didn't expect much from it anyways because it's just stir-fried tomato and egg on top of steam rice with a side of veggie.  Beef potsicker had a nice presentation but the taste was very average.  On to the last item of the night which was dandan noodle. This tasted nothing like dandan noodle I have anywhere else and it was cold. At first we thought maybe they brought us the wrong item because the people making the noodles behind the clear glass and the waitresses were all non-Asians (I know this sounds horrible but can't help but being a little stereotypical here). But then the waitress ensured us that it WAS indeed dandan noodle. She was nice enough to offer a little sesame sauce on the side to go with it though. At the end when I went to the bathroom I overheard the two 'chefs' talking to each other in Mandarin. This made them screwing up the taste of dandan noodle unforgiving to me.   Overall I didn't enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. I think I was hyped up by the reviews too much before coming in so expectation was too high. However I did really like their interior decor and how you can see they're making noodle. It is kinda like teppanyaki without people spitting over your food.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited this place after we saw an ad on this restaurant. The reviews on Yelp convinced us that we should try.  This is a very small eatery and can accommodate about 19 people at one setting.  It is located in a small strip mall. The interior decoration is pretty modern and has an large open kitchen. The appliances in the kitchen are all well provided and taken care of.   The menu is a small menu but large enough to offer a variety of dishes.  Specifically, this restaurant tends to cater to the younger generations and possibly to the non-asian group. Henceforth, spicy hot dishes are not really that hot.   We ordered four dishes:  1. Cucumber salad - strips of cold, crisp cucumbers mixed with a hot, spicy sesame sauce. The sauce is tasty and the cucumbers are fresh. Unfortunately, the cucumber too can have a bit of a flavor. If you like plainer food, this is ideal. For me, it is a bit too plain. Nonetheless, it is a B+.  2. Beef Pancakes - minced beef in a piping hot Bao. Very juicy and tasty. Though one has to be careful to eat them as the juice can be too hot to the tongue. Love this dish and it is definitively an A.  3. Pork dumpling -  presentation is nice but a major disappointment in taste. Can use some extra flavoring. The worst dish of the day. A solid C.   4. Shang Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodle - my wife likes the noodle although I feel it is a bit on the tough side. The beef ( and tendons ) are well cooked, very flavorful and the meat is tender. But the soup is a bit diluted, a bit more concentrated will be better. Still worth a solid B+.  Service is good. Pricing is reasonable. Food improvement is possible, whether it is necessary or not depends on customers' taste.   For us, we are searching for the perfect Beef brisket noodle soup and we have yet to find it. But we will be back to this place till ....",

My first impression of the restaurant was its narrow space and limited seatings. Second impression was its cleanliness and extremely fast service. Third impression was the quality of the fresh hand-pulled noodles. I did taste the difference of the noodles here; it was way better than all of the pre-made packaged noodles I've always had at other restaurants. The flavor and freshness of the noodles are outstanding. In all honesty, I was not blown away by it but definitely did have some good impressions of this place. I do recommend this place if you're looking to try some fresh hand-made noodles in a clean setting but it's not a place for a big party to dine in, just FYI. I personally would return for their good food and good service.",

The menu is very to the point and questions on the menu were answered with clarity. Service is quick and friendly! The noodles were very very fresh- husband got the hand pulled and I got the knife sliced noodles. We both ordered the Shang beef (the one with a dark broth). The broth hit the spot and warmed us up after being in the rain. The price is good but I'm saying this after paying premium price for every meal for the past few days on the strip so maybe it's biased? But approx 20 dollars for two full bowls of fresh noodles? That's a good and fair deal! My husband and I only wished this business existed in Dallas because it's so delicious! So happy to have had this as our last meal during this vacation!",

Honestly this sauce ruined it for me. Made the app heavy and hard to eat. Cucumbers warm too. Pretty gross. They need to scrap this app and go with traditional lighter spicy cold cucumber app instead.   Beef pancakes: 5/5. This was very good. Had nice texture and flavors. Our party all agreed it was the best dish we tried.   Beef with knife edge noodle soup: 3/5. The broth was good but not spicy like Im used too. The noodles were too firm/starchy at first but softened up over time when allowed to soak in broth longer. If they sliced the noodles thinner it would be much better. The beef was the worst part. It was very fatty and sinewy with majority almost impossible to chew. Pretty much scrapped the beef. Needs better beef quality. They gave a lot of noodles so thats good.   Spicy Wontons: 2/5. The whole dish felt heavy. Not silky smooth or light. We kill this at Din Tai Fung. Not here. Something is off.   Wonton seafood soup: I didnt try it but others said it was very good. Maybe worth a try.   Overall service was friendly and prompt.",

You can choose your noodle type and we got the knife shaved for all three dishes. The noodles were fantastic and we watched the cooks shave it fresh from a block of dough as we were seated at the counter.  My favorite dish was the beef noodle as the meat was very tender + the soup was very flavorful. The chicken chow mein was a large portion and tasty but was slightly salty for me. Dan dan was probably my least favorite but it wasn't bad - just the flavors were more average.  Overall 3.5 stars and food was good, but I do think the 4.5 on Yelp is slightly inflated.",

Love the counter where you can sit and watch them make the noodles by hand, drop it into the water, and plated to you.   The food came out FAST!   The real highlight is the noodles and how fresh it is. Not frozen. The sauces and \"toppings\" are all pretty standard.   We got the Dan Dan Noodles with Hand Pulled noodles. Texture was al dente just how I love it. The Dan Dan sauce was too salty for mine likings. I love a good Sichuan Dan Dan noodle and these were more Northern style. Still good though.   The Peking Zha Jiang Mian was delicious. Absolutely my favorite. I got the thick cut noodles. Carbs overload but so worth it. The black bean sauce and the bean sprouts, cucumbers, carrots, beans... all just came together so well.   The Spicy Wontons were a miss for me. Soggy and too oily.   The \"pancake\" or \"bing\" is actually really good. The style is like a pot stickers but round. It is a tad greasy but this dish is like that. Everywhere you go it is like this.   Prices were great. I enjoyed it.",

So naturally we had high expectations but no, the noodles were overly cooked, not al dente at all and had no qualities of fresh made noodles. Factory made noodles are better than this any day. This place does not by any means do justice to Chinese noodle soups. Very Americanized.  The soups were passable, not great and the beef shank and stew were the strongest points for the noodle soups. The spicy wontons weren't bad but they were tiny and timid.  I have yet to find a really great place to eat in Vegas. There were a few great places years ago but it looks like the populace is complacent and touristy about food. It is more about name brands, zagat ratings and just being Las Vegas. Still looking.",

Even when I'm ravenously hungry, I always leave satisfied. Depending on how much self-control I have that day, I either end up with leftovers or slightly uncomfortable from eating too much.  Additionally, they do have vegetarian options: Tomato & Egg Noodle and their Tomato & Egg Rice, which is essentially one flavor option, but boy, do they do it well. The flavors are simple, yet harmonious. The sweetness from the tomato, the savoriness of the egg, the fresh component from the bok choy, and the great texture from their hand-pulled noodles work amazing together. A+ veggie option for my non-meat eating homies.   Lastly, while they do have a smaller menu, it's broad enough to offer something for everyone. And I can attest that Shang Artisan Noodle may do less, but they definitely do it well.",

The noodles are fresh and made in front of you and the broth is very rich and flavorful. At the very affordable price of $9.95, you can get yourself an amazingly delicious bowl of piping hot noodle soup. The spicy wontons are also a good appetizer to start with. It definitely has a kick to it, so only order this if you can handle some heat! The sauce for the spicy wontons is so good, I ended up tossing some noodles in it to finish it up haha. I've also had the dandan noodles, but I wasn't a fan. It just tasted spicy to me without depth of flavor. I've been wanting to try the tomato and egg noodles, so I will be back!",

Added bok choy to this dish but it was under cooked a bit.    Shang Beef Noodle - Chose knife-shaved noodle style. Brisket was tender, bok choy was cooked perfectly. The broth was sweeter than expected but had a decent flavor.   Yang-Zhou Fried Rice - Good mix of ingredients. Rice was fluffy and is a good shared plate for 2-3 people.  Overall the food tasted fresh and clean. Atmosphere was welcoming and temperature was fine. Music could have been louder. FOH staff was attentive; we sat at the bar and could see BOH cooking, hand-pulling noodles which was neat. Menu was easy to read and I liked their utensils and serving dishes.",

A friend of mine was in town and had a late flight back to California so we were looking for somewhere interesting to eat. He is Chinese and asked me if I had ever had handmade noodles before. I had not, so he Yelp'ed it and found Shang. He basically ordered for me, as I told him just to pick whatever he thought would be good, but everything was so flavorful and delicious. I know we got spicy wontons - very spicy for me but totally worth the mouth burn - and a cucumber salad, which was very different than what I've had, being that I'm used to a basic sliced cucumber salad made with rice vinegar. This one had some sort of tangy nutty sauce drizzled all on the top of it, which was very delicious. The noodles were almost like comfort food. I wish I had more experience with these types of noodles, so I could describe them better, but I suppose if you've never had them before (say, you're more familiar with ramen noodles, or pho, or udon) then you'll be in the same boat as I am and perhaps will give this place a try based on my noodle-naive review :)",

    "text": "What type of Chinese person doesn't eat rice? Me! I can live without rice but I simply can't live without noodles. Hand-pulled and knife-shaved noodles are some of my favorites and I have been dying to try Shang Artisan Noodle.  It was only 11:15 (15 minutes after opening) and most of the tables were already full. Within 15 more minutes, the entire restaurant was packed. There was only one guy waiting tables at first and two people in the kitchen so service/food was a bit slow but they tried their best. I love that you could see the guy pull the noodles. It was very cool!  We started with spicy wontons. I'd give these 3 stars - they weren't spicy enough and the sauce was too liquid and did not have enough chili.  We also got two bowls of noodles to share: Shang Beef Hand-Pulled Noodles and Dan Dan Knife Cut Noodles. I'd give both of them 4 stars but for different reasons.  The Beef noodles had a good flavor (although my own beef noodle soup had more depth of flavor than this version). I wanted to love the hand-pulled noodles but upon closer inspection, they varied too much in size. I understand that they are handmade but the precision just isn't quite there.  The Knife Cut noodles had a more authentic texture. However, I'm not sure what part of the sauce mix makes it \"Dan Dan\" style. I was disappointed that it wasn't really Dan Dan noodles at all.  If you're looking for great tasting hand-made noodles, Shang meets that criteria. Authenticity is questionable.",

If you're craving Asian noodles, this is the perfect spot! Their service was A+! What I consider good service is: how comfortable guests feel sitting in a restaurant, and being aware of our needs and meeting them.   We came in with a party of 8, which made us wait a little bit longer before we could be seated, but it's understandable since it's a weekend afternoon.   We ordered the Dan Dan noodles, Shank Beef Noodles, the yang-Zhou fried rice, beef pancakes, beef&onion dumplings, and spicy wontons. THEY WERE ALL DELICIOUS!!   This spot is great too if you're looking for that Asian comfort food because they all got it! Highly recommend!",

The water is perfectly cool and has a slight hint of cucumber that really quenches my thirst.

The decor was modern with industrial finishes and the small location was almost empty, save for a few tables. We opted to sit at the bar to watch the noodle pullers (is that right term?) and were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. We ordered the spicy wontons as an appetizer and both of us elected to have the beefy noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles.   YUM. The spicy wontons were really small, but the sauce was delicious and we gobbled them up very quickly. My mom's  a super picky eater and, owning a restaurant herself, is definitely an Asian food snob, but she really enjoyed the wontons. Our noodle soups came next and they definitely didn't disappoint. The noodles, although hand-pulled, were consistently chewy. The broth was rich and flavorful. The beef was so tender it seemed as though it had been cooking all day. The bokchoy was a welcoming relief of freshness to the dish as well. By the time we were eating, there was a line to get into the restaurant!  Overall, it was so delicious and if I'm back in Vegas, I will definitely come back to Shang's.",

The pork belly noodles didn't have enough flavor to the signature pork broth. Both dishes just didn't have a strong enough flavor for them to be savory and authentic. The seafood soup noodles is a light, but flavorful broth. If you're in the mood for something with a lighter soup (chicken broth) and healthier ingredients (shrimp, squid, fishcakes, veggies), this is the noodle soup to get.  I always get the knife-shaved noodles because it's more traditional and crafty, and I always feel full after an entire bowl of chewy noodles. I love their various flavors of waters that, apparently, changes on a daily basis. The watermelon-infused is my favorite. The interior is very welcoming, modern and clean. Bar seating offers a view behind the open kitchen where the chefs hand-pull / shave the noodles and cook them fresh. I will come back again to try some of their other dishes!",

We also ordered an order of the wontons.  The wontons were okay.  Something about their wonton skins was kinda weird.  Their noodles were really good and they give so much meat.  The meat was pretty tender as well.  However, I was so disappointed in their noodles!  Their so called freshly made noodles tasted exactly like regular frozen noodles.  They didn't have that bite or chewiness to it.  I was so disappointed.  They also don't serve sour mustard like regular beef stew noodle places.  Anyways, overall it was pretty good.

Overall I won't be back because of the many options we have in the city . I was looking for a fresh noodle spot  and this was it but the flavors disappointed .",

As a result service is slow and when the waitress went on break, no one took our bill and I had to ask the kitchen staff about it. - Please put in more stools and tables. Additional 2 2-person tables and 3 stools can easily fit.  - Some pieces of beef were too much tendon and were too big. Need to be trimmed more and cut into smaller more uniform pieces. - The wooden spoons are very chic and hipster, but they are too shallow for scooping up broth!  Please get bigger spoons :)",

Our server Ciara, despite being the only server, handled every customer genuinely and took the time to check back periodically throughout meals. She was so friendly and so so kind, her service really put our experience over the top. She made everyone's interaction personal; my friend and I lingered drinking tea (which is delicious by the way - try the hot tea) awhile after our meal and Ciara kept reminding us that it was no trouble and we were welcome to stay.   The food was soooo delicious!! I got the beef shank soup with hand pulled noodles. The noodles are nice and firm, the beef was sooo tender and juicy, and the broth was JUST SO GOOD. We also shared a plate of spicy wontons which are divine; they aren't too spicy, they have a very sweet nutty/sesame spice to them.. so good. Just so good.   Definitely will be back. Love this place so far.",

There could be a bit of a wait during the weekends since the place itself is quite small, but trust.. it's worth the wait!  There's hand pulled noodles or knife-cut noodles. If you go with a friend, I suggest getting both so you can try both out to see which one you prefer. I personally liked the hand pulled one better as knife-cut noodles were a bit too thick for me. The noodle soup itself was a bit spicy, but definitely hits the spot for the perfect 'hangover' food.   I can't wait to go back to eat there the next time I'm in Vegas again!!!",

    "text": "Amazing noodle shop close to the Strip. There was a long line for lunch (since this restaurant is pretty small), but it was worth. We were seated at the bar where you can see the chefs hard at work and watch how they make their noodles while you wait for your food, which was really interesting.   They offer 3 different options for their noodles, and I opted for the hand-pulled noodles for my beef noodle soup. I loved the difference in textures and sizes for the hand-pulled noodles while I ate them. I remember my eyes widening when I took my first bite-- the soup was so flavorful, rich, and overall perfect. There was such a generous amount of green onions at the top. You can really taste how high quality all of the ingredients are and how much care they put into the quality of their noodles.   I will say though that the cucumbers caught us off guard. The sesame sauce drizzled on them were like a chunky, thick paste and the cucumbers were a little on the sweeter side. I don't think we'd get those again, but after all, the cucumbers aren't really what you come here for. All in all, Shang is pretty high up there on my list of all-time favorite beef noodle soups.",

    "text": "OK, so I'm probably going to disappoint some, irk others, or maybe just surprise some by the fact that I was not wowed by Shang Artisan Noodle.  Please don't hate me because I did not love this place.  But I did not love this place.  Like, if we went on a blind date, I would not go on a second date (well, unless he was paying, and I had absolutely no other place to go on a Saturday night, and it was a chance to eat some shrimp scampi).  I just don't get the high praise by so many.  It really is not a 4+ star place in my opinion.  (It's not a 1 or 2 star place, either.  Should probably average 3 1/2 stars, I think, based on my experience).    Well, overall, my impression was that this place was mostly horse and pony show and less substance.  The noodles were average, as was the broth.  What makes this place a stand-out are the decor and the marketing.  The line is out the door.  Word of mouth, Yelp reviews, and heavy advertising has made this the go-to place for a noodle shop in the area.  So, there is that False buzz that happens when there is the \"velvet rope,\" and people have to wait, and wait, and wait, to get into a casual eatery which does not take reservations.  You almost feel like, \"wow, this place MUST be good! Look how long the line is!\" Friends of Yelp, I have to say to you today, that is a False impression.    I really like the decor.  It is super on trend, exposed red brick, white subway tiles, steel backsplash, wooden half benches and small yellow wood tables, faux wood floor, Chinese calligraphy wherever possible, wooden spoons, dark, monochromatic Qing dynasty plates, and the obligatory see-through kitchen, with a \"bad-ass\" old guy roping up raw noodles.  It's tasteful and sparkly, and un-Las Vegas.  That I like a lot.  That gives it an extra star.  (Otherwise, Shang would only garner \"2\" from me.)  The food was just okay, not that great, and considering the hype of the place, disappointing.  Perhaps if I had not gone in with 5-star expectations, I would have enjoyed it more.  But more likely, perhaps if I had not been first to \"The Magic Noodle,\" (please see my review of that excellent noodle place), I would have not been so disappointed.  The knife-cut noodles here were dull and chewy.  The broth for the beef noodle soup I chose lacked depth and piquancy.  The vegetables did not seem well-chosen for the soup, and lacked the ability to round out the flavor or punch it up.  My dining companion said the same.  We split some pot stickers and a couple other appetizers.  They were oily, flavorless, dull, and/or unmemorable.  Not exciting or flavorful, particularly for a place that focuses just on noodles and small plates, such as we ordered.  My friends and I declined to take a \"doggy bag\" of what we did not finish.  The food was not bad! Don't get me wrong.  The food was ok, and the restaurant was very clean and tidy.  Just not awesome.  I think another problem is the long wait.  We probably waited for about an hour.  When you make people wait that long, and outside in the cold, rain, and wind (because there is no room in the Inn, i.e., the restaurant entrance), as happened with us, and you refuse to have a reservation system, or even one of those square handheld thingies that lights up and vibrates to let you know that your table is ready so you can at least wait in your nearby car, naturally, there are some expectations built up.  It better be darn good.  Like Soup Nazi good (or \"Taco Nazi\"--see my review of El Jefe's Taco Shop, which by the way, does not require you to wait in the cold, though they are in a gas station and have little seating like Shang Artisan Noodle, and have about the same number of customers-they just have their act together).  I will be stoic and put up with a lot for a good meal.  I am already planning my hour-and-a-half long wait for Palace Station's \"The Oyster Bar\" next week, which I am told is the norm.  But, ma'am or sir, if I have to wait an hour in the elements to taste your food, hungry and cold, without so much as a hot cup of tea, or a menu, in hand, WOW ME. That didn't happen here.    As a final note, I think there is some disconnect happening with Shang. On the one hand, it wants to be a down-home, get-'er-done-and-get-out, we-don't-want-to-talk-to-you, Chinese noodle shop. (Which, \"The Magic Noodle\" does excellently, as I mentioned).  On the other hand, it wants to be the precious, trendy, take-your-time-and-eat-we-don't-rush-our-patrons-aren't-we-precious? type of hipster place that gives the impression of authenticity (and apparently, persuades many of this), but really is about the Instagram post. I think this is a shame.  Shang need only make some changes after some soul-searching to make this place really as awesome as its raving fans insist it already is.  If you come, manage your expectations.  Bring a warm coat in the winter, and a portable motorized fan in the summer, and your own beverages as you wait.  But I would not return.",

From the spicy wontons to the dan dan noodles, you can't go wrong with anything you order. Only regret was not ordering the 3 other dishes I wanted! Your girl didn't want to look like too much of a fatty. Hah! But, portions are huge! Tables so small, if you have extra space you just ain't doing it right! Quality top notch!

    "text": "I was debating between 3-3.5 stars, but I wouldn't return here so rounding down. Shang Artisan Noodle is located a few miles off the strip, and is closer if you're staying on the Wynn side. Their space isn't very big, and it was about a 20 minute wait for a party of 3 at 12:45 on a Friday. Make sure you add your name on the list to the right of the front door (next to the cash register). I really liked that you could watch the chef continuously making noodles in the front area, but there's not a lot of room to stand while you wait.   They have three different type of noodles to choose from for the dishes: Hand Pulled, Knife Shaved, or Plain Noodle. We ended up trying:  -Cucumber Salad (w/Sesame Sauce, $4.99, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-_m28q2FS-OEyzj2OujYMA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum- this dish was actually my favorite part of the meal! The cucumbers were so fresh, and that sesame sauce was SO GOOD. I actually used the extra sauce to dip the wontons and noodles in. If you like cucumbers, this dish is a must order! -Spicy Wonton (w/Spicy Soy Sauce, $5.99, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=213IULazO2eKPug7ZRDoDw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Solid, but nothing special. The wonton skins were nice and thin, and the meat seemed good quality, but the sauce was just ok- use the sesame sauce from the cucumbers instead! I wouldn't order this again. -Shang Beef Noodle (w/Hand Pulled Noodle, Braised Beef Brisket, Veggies, w/Hand-Pulled Noodle, $9.95, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lgQ4AJFarRvc7DsR-mza8g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZyMHUormSWuzrdf0MaQlDQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): We all liked the hand pulled noodles over the knife shaved (they were too thick), and this was my favorite out of the noodle dishes. The broth was a little too salty for us, but it was flavorful, and the beef tendons were nice and tender. The beef pieces were mostly chewy though, and not that great. Although this was my favorite noodle dish, I wouldn't order this again. -Pork Belly Noodle (w/Knife Shaved Noodle, Braised Pork Belly, Veggies, w/Knife Shaved Noodle, $9.95, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kLV8Y9LZBNgu_h4RxCadcg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2KfoXFxXSkNEWSmpdQ78AQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Eh, I didn't like this dish much. The broth was very salty, and the pork belly had a pork-y flavor. The pieces weren't quite tender enough, and we didn't even finish the pork belly pieces (that's how not good they were). We may have received a bad batch, but I wouldn't order this again based on the dish I had. -Dan-Dan Noodle (w/Hand Pulled Noodle, Minced Pork, Preserved Veggie, Spicy Soy Sauce, $8.95, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Y353R68M7X2GOU2ytQ2GTw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NxjNNl722eBn7Afjgq5oIg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Eh, this dish was bland and boring. However, it was a lot better when you added the sesame sauce from the cucumber salad. I would recommend ordering the sesame noodle dish over this one if you're looking for non-soup noodles.  Service was fine, and the food came out quickly once we ordered. Since I'm spoiled by really good noodle places in the Bay Area, I wouldn't make the trek to come out here. They have parking spots available, but the plaza they are located in is small.",

    "text": "Definitely worth a trip off the Strip.  Noods had amazing texture and the broth was rich with great depth. You can choose the noodle type but hand-pulled is the namesake and go-to for me. The restaurant is small, but they maximized seating inside and the line goes pretty quickly. There's a glass wall thru which you can watch them pull the noods and cook your foods.   We ordered: -Shang beef noodles, hand-pulled with extra wontons and bokchoy: best beef noodle soup ever -cucumber salad: pleasantly surprised by the peanut/satay sauce -spicy wontons: delicious  -pork and cabbage dumplings: would skip  I definitely will come back to try the Dan Dan noodles and Zha-Jiang noodles!",

Waitress and waiter are super nice to explain you all the detail when you order and when they deliver the food to our table. Outstanding service!!!  Spicy wonton: It's very good. But it is not too spicy (so I add some chili sauce by myself.), and it is a little bit sweet to my taste.   Beef pancake: it is right size for appetizer. It is very authentic.  Beef shank noodles: I order knife-Shaved noodles, noodles are outstanding. The broth is very good!   I definitely come back and suggest my friends to come here!",

I've only ordered the sauce noodle dishes but they've both been amazing.  I had the egg and tomato as well as chicken and mushroom and I also tried my friend's chicken sesame cold noodles which I'm planning to order the next time I'm in town.  Serving size here is very generous.  Come when you're hungry or you'll definitely have leftovers (which is also great!).  A friend got the extra noodles before but his eyes were bigger than his stomach because the regular portion is already a very filling meal.  Service here is also great.  The servers are all very nice and helpful.  Also, prices are super affordable especially considering the portion size!",

    "text": "Remarkable hand crafted noodles off of the strip in Las Vegas within an approximately $10 Uber rides from the main strip of Vegas.  It is so amazingly delicious with excellent services.    We arrived at 11:30am and the place was already packed with the first comers for the first opening services.  The place is not huge with bar and table seatings.  We waited about 15 minutes being entertained by the noodles chefs making the hand crafted noodles, pulling strings of noodles from a huge dough.  As seated, we were immediately greeted by the server.  Ordered the cucumber salad, spicy won ton, beef pancake, shang beef noodle,  and beef shank noodle.  The cucumber salad was very refreshing tossed with sesame/peanut sauce.  The spicy won ton noodle was not so spicy, but had a heat of schezwan sauce that complimented the dish.  The beef pancake was one of my favorites with crispy doughy coating of the pancake that held up the beef juice inside.  It's a smaller version of pan stirred bun, but with much favor of seasoned beef.  The broth in both noodle soups tasted very home cooked that had been stewed for many hours which provided a comfort feel.  Great dish to have after long hours of drinking in Vegas.  The beef shank was thinly sliced and with a soft texture,  the noodles was nicely pulled and chewy.  Overall, its a winner and can't wait to return.",

Love how concise the menu is--they're known for a couple of signature dishes so those are the ones we ordered. And they did not disappoint.   Love the open kitchen--the chef makes all the noodles by hand (that arm workout, though). I was entertained the entire 30-minute wait time.

Shang closes at 10 everyday. I arrived around 9:20 and there was still a couple parties waiting before. The restaurant is a little small with only a few tables. I opted for the bar since I was starving.  We ordered the spicy wontons as an appetizer, Shang beef noodle, and the dan dan noodles. Everything was delicious, although I'd probably skip the wontons and get another bowl of noodles next time. For the price and size, I'd add a couple more dollars and get more of their hand pulled noodles.  The Shang beef noodle would be perfect as a hangover cure. I'd prefer it over pho. The soup is so rich and the meats are tender. The flavors of the dan dan noodle were great, but beware of the spice. When they say spicy, they don't mess around!  Bang for your buck for a dinner and a show. Watching them hand pull noodles was pretty cool. My new spot to go to after a long night of partying.",

All their noodles are handmade and you can actually see them making the noodles by hand.  One of my favorite noodles is their knife-shaved noodle.  They use a large piece of noodle and use a sharp knife to shave little strands of noodle directly to the boiling water.   This is my favorite because it tastes chewy and not too thick or thin.  I ordered their Artisan Beef Noodle with Knife-shaved noodle and I also added extra noodles for $1.50 extra.   Their beef broth was full of flavor but not spicy enough for my liking.  But it's okay, they have a container of spicy sauce on the table which tastes spicy enough.   I am so glad Vegas has this restaurant.  It is too bad they don't have this restaurant near where I live.",

I got the hand pulled beef noodle soup and it was so good I had to order an extra side bowl of noodles to really feel satisfied. The noodles were extremely well cooked- got that bouncy/chewy texture, and absorbed the flavorful broth well. We also ordered the spicy wonton and the beef pancake appetizers. I personally did not like how the wontons were flavored, there was some sweetness to it which in my opinion did not mesh well with the main spicy flavor, but again it's all opinion. I did enjoy the beef pancakes though (I don't think they're those exact appetizer names, forgive me). And everything was so reasonably priced!   Definitely will return soon.",

They had great ratings so I figured it would live up to the the hype, but it didn't. Coming from CA, Shang just didn't compare to the many taiwanese noodle shops we have. We ordered the beef noodle soup and the chicken noodle stir fry. The stir fry was way too oily and the noodles weren't al dente, they were mushy and over cooked. The noodles were cooked better in the beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup tasted like it was lacking something, but I couldn't pinpoint it. Their version definitely tasted more Americanized and not traditional. Service was slow as most of the waiters/waitress were very young adults. Overall wouldn't go out of my way to come here and it isn't worth the wait.",

The chili oil was super spicy. It kind of over powered the whole thing and couldn't enjoy it at all. If you've been to DTF, the spicy won is very flavorful and had a little kick to it, but not too much, and was just perfect!   Our waitress never came to us, I had to literally get up and ask for water twice and got up to ask for our check as well.   The two stars was for the soup we got which was the best seller. The broth was tasteful and yummy.  I may give it another try someday, but I'm good for now.",

FOOD:  - Pork Belly Noodle: The broth is so delicious, and the hand pulled noodles have more of a bite and thickness to them. My only criticism, would be to make a spicy option. Also they give you huge chunks of delicious pork belly.  - Spicy Wonton: I love these. For my tastes it's not very spicy and taste a bit more sweet; however, I have a pretty high spice tolerance.  - Beef Pancake: The name is a bit misleading, it's not really a pancake, more like a huge dumpling. My favorite part is when you bite into it and the juice comes flowing out of the pancake.",

We both remembered how good the mushroom and chicken noodles were so ordered that again.  You do have a choice of the type of noodle to order.  We went for the hand pulled. My order came first even though we ordered the same dish.  The other bowl came about 3 minutes later.  The meal was just as savory as before although the chicken ratio was on the slim side.  Still tasty.  Prices are good, environment is modern and clean.  Parking is available",

We were seated immediately at the open-kitchen bar where the chefs were hand tossing the house made noodles. The place is small, but chic.   We tried the twisted noodles as well as the shaved ones- fascinating to watch- yummy to eat! Fresh and delicious. The Tomato & Egg Noodle Bowl was excellent as was the Pork Belly Noodle Soup. Try the amazing Beef Pancakes, which can easily be shared. I've never had these before so I can't compare them to any others, but they were super tasty!   The cool vibe, noodle-twisting chefs, and super friendly service get my 5 Stars!",

    "text": "Came here as they opened at 11, we were the first ones in the door. By the time we were done eating though there was a pretty big line of at least 10 people waiting to be seated. It's a modestly sized shop so if you come at a busy time expect a wait. We got excited and ordered a lot of noodles. We got a black bean noodle, dan dan noodle, chow mein, a beef noodle soup, some other beef noodle soup, chili dumplings, cucumbers in peanut sauce, and a seafood wonton soup wiht noodles added, and finally a cold sesame noodle. Everything was amazing and my expectations were exceeded. Definitely very fresh noodles, they were all made fresh. The meat was cooked excellently and had great flavor and was very tender. It was also obvious they used a really good flavorful broth and different broths for each type of noodle. This is probably the best Chinese noodle establishment I've ever been to in the US and tastes very legit. Food came out pretty fast, especially considering they were making it fresh. Everything just tasted amazing.  Their chili oil was also extremely flavorful and delicious.   Black bean noodle was great, dan dan noodle was great, the chow mein was one of the best I've ever had. So flavorful, very oily but you just kept wanting to eat it, amazing. The two beef noodle soups had amazing flavor and the broth was really the highlight and each was beefy in it's own amazing way. The chili dumplings were great and there were 6-8 in a serving I believe. The dumplings had extremely flavorful filling. The cucumbers had an excellent sauce and tasted even better with hot sauce on it. Also a great palate cleanser with all the carbs we had and oil. The seafood wonton soup is very light, great sick person food. The cold sesame noodles you have to stir up cause the sauce is at the bottom. Also delicious.   If I ever come to Vegas again I'll have to come back and order more noodles.",

The kids also enjoy the pork rib noodles and chicken chow main.  If you like chili oil theirs is goood, but really on the spicy side.  So if you can't handle spice just start with a few drops ;)  the service is decent and the waits can be long.  Overall the food is good and i think it's worth giving it a try.

    "text": "A serious gem so close to the strip! It literally took us 6 mins by uber to get here from the Bellagio. Seating is limited and they were still pretty busy when we went at 2:00 pm on a Thursday. I love the layout and the partial open kitchen. It is a real treat to be able to see the chef hand pull the noodles while enjoying the food!   We ordered the spicy wontons, shang's beef noodle soup (with hand pulled noodles), dan dan noodle (with knife shaved noodles), and yangzhou fried rice. The spicy wontons were a recommended dish and I have read plenty of great reviews on it but in my own opinion it did not live up to its reputation. It is good, but I wouldn't say it is out of this world. I would prefer it with more filling. It is still a great appetiser to share. Next time I really want to try the beef pancakes!   The beef noodle soup is definitely a winner! When we went it was literally 105 outside and it did not stop me from drinking all the broth! It was amazing. It is slightly different from the traditional Taiwanese Beef Noodles but the closest in comparison. The beef is incredibly tender and well portioned. The hand-pulled noodles pairs perfectly. The noodles are so fresh and cooked to perfection and coat the broth very well. The only thing is that I would request for extra broth as I am a slow eater and by the middle of my meal, I have very little soup left.   The dan dan noodles is advertised as spicy but it is definitely not anything too outrageous. I typically don't eat spicy but could handle this dish. This is their own take of dan dan noodles and not as traditional. Nevertheless, it was amazing. So flavourful and huge portions. I love that the customer can choose what kind of noodles they want as each provide a different experience. The knife-shaved noodles are thicker and have more texture to them. It was definitely a carbo-load type of day, totally worth it though.   Although the yangzhou fried rice did not look like anything special and seen on virtually every Chinese restaurant's menu, Shang's is definitely one of the better ones I have had. There was a solid ingredients to rice ratio and the seasoning was on point. Besides the beef noodles, this was my second favorite dish!   Service was fast and professional. This is the perfect place to get away from the strip or to nurse a hangover. I absolutely cannot wait to come back!",

For example what is this difference between the 3 types of noddles they offer and which one does she recommend. She just shrugged her shoulders, rolled her eyes and said hand pulled I guess. Once our food came she never came to check on us or refill our drinks. I had to ask as she was walking by for a fork for my son and she just handed me one and kept walking. Now we are here trying to get our bill so we can get out of here and nothing we are still on ignore. It's a shame because the food was soooooo yummy!!!",

The prices are reasonable but I have to say that I am a bit disappointed in their star products, noodles.  We tried both the hand pulled and knife shaved.  I think the noodles are over cooked and not chewy enough for me.  However their beef shank and beef stock are excellent.  It is not easy to make a clear beef broth and they definitely have that down.  Also their beef pancakes were juicy and authentic.  Maybe when I am in town next time, I will ask them to not overcook my noodles and under cook it a little, then maybe it will be the right texture.",

I ordered the Dan Dan Mein which was super delicious with a little kick. My mom ordered pork belly which was super tender and savory. Overall I give this place a twelve out of ten and would recommend it to all noodle lovers.",

The broth itself was also much saltier than I would have liked with no option for adjustments, as the soups are all made ahead of time.

You have some live entertainment from the guy hand pulling noodles in the back window which is a great way to get you excited for what's about to come. The menu is just large enough to have something for everyone- hot dishes, cold dishes, soups, noodles, fried rice, dumplings.  We started with the cucumber salad which wasn't the style which I was expecting it to be- no fault of theirs. I was thinking more along the lines of slightly pickled cucumbers with chili oil, but what came was medium sized sticks of cucumber drenched in creamy sesame sauce. It was a little heavier for my liking.  I ordered the hand pulled noodles with mushrooms and chicken. The mushrooms were a nice mix of at least three different toothsome varieties and they, along with the chicken, had a wonderful wok flavor to them. It made me very curious to try their fried rice, something I generally never order. While this dish was solid, and generous in size, I would rather try something else from the menu the next time I go. Given their super fresh nature, the noodles just didn't have enough chew for me, and I think I'd prefer the hand cut noodles more.  Overall, a solid option and I have respect for what they're doing but I'm not rushing to go back. There are other options in the same dining plaza which hold my heart captivated :)",

The sauces and broths had a perfectly balanced flavors and the meat was tender.  The chicken & mushroom bowl had these black mushrooms that were so tasty.  The spicy beef dumplings were the best dumplings we have ever had, just the right amount of heat.  Large portion size and the noodles are hand made (we saw them making them).  The service was as good as the food.  The servers were friendly and helpful and made our visit very pleasant.  Loved it!!!",

It's set up similar to Monta with a bar where you can watch the cooks as well as a few tables. We had the poke belly soup with hand pulled noodles which was fantastic. The broth was really flavorful and the pork very tender. We also had the potstickers which were tasty and the presentation was beautiful. Cucumber salad was good but the dressing was a little heavy for my taste. The poem and cabbage dumplings were tender and nicely seasoned.

The staff is very friendly and efficient.  We ordered beef and onion dumplings, pork and onion dumplings,Shang Beef, Dan Dan and Beef Shank noodle soups.  The Shang Beef soup is very aromatic and absolutely delicious. The Beef shank comes with a clear broth which is refreshing and very light.  They have peppers at each table so you can increase the spice level for those that like spicy food.  Dan Dan was nice and spicy. The dumplings were crispy and juicy. Overall the best noodle soup/dish we ever had.  Also, they don't add any MSG to their dishes and the salt level is right on point.  I didn't feel parched couple of hours after eating here.  Will be a repeat customer!",

Today 9.8.16 was their official Grand Opening day. Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated at once at this modern and clean place. Great use of space despite being small inside. However the bar with an open kitchen was cool and exciting to watch while waiting for your food being prepared. Moving on to the food we had.  Appetizers: Cucumber Salad-Fresh and crisp cucumber and seasoned just right with a hint of spice. The dressing was like a cross of peanut butter and chili oil flavoring. Beef Pancake-Juicy meat patty with a slight crisp paper texture that went well with the soy based sauced it came with. Spicy Wontons-Balanced Flavor and texture. The spices went well with the soy garlic flavoring with chili oil.  Main Dishes: Beef Shang Noodle Soup-Awesome broth and the hand pulled noodle was just right in texture. Chicken & Mushroom Noodle-Good dish that was well seasoned and great alternative from their soup options. Seafood Noodle Soup-Delicious and flavorful. The broth was balanced and not too salty.  Overall we had a good time and the service was on point. The server was very attentive and was very knowledgable with the menu. She was very helpful and patient with us especially when it came to deciding if we wanted Hand-Pulled Noodles or Knife-Shaved Noodles with our main dishes. Great place to bring family and friends from out of town with a good West Central location that is not to far away from the Strip.",

Their service is amazing, and your food comes out relatively fast.  I would recommend the original beef noodle soup. Their tomato and egg noodles are also great if you are craving something light. Get them in their famous \"hand-pulled\" version. Every now and then, we would also get the potstickers. Keep in mind though, the potstickers would take at least 15 mins or more to cook, so order them first if you must. Their cucumber infused water is also delicious! All in all, I would highly recommend this place.",

Oh, but I do like the ladies room - check it out!   For day 2 of business, the servers were friendly and knew the menu items. I asked one server what she recommended, and she said a popular item is the Beef Pancake. The Beef Pancake is more of a pan fried dumpling than a pancake. Be careful when you take your first bite as there is juice that will squirt out! It was enjoyable, but I like a thinner dumpling skin like XLBs.   The Sesame Chicken Cold Noodle dish was made with fresh sesame paste/sauce. There was a strong sesame flavor but not overwhelming. With the hot weather, this was a refreshing dish. Filling too if you finish by yourself.   Lastly, I tried the Pork Belly Noodle soup with Knife Shaved noodles. I enjoyed the knife shaved noodles a lot, and will make it my go to noodle here. The broth flavor was ok, but needed an added element, so I added in their house spicy chili sauce. This definitely perked up the flavor, and along with the pork belly pieces, it was a solid noodle soup.   I will be back to try more! See you soon Shang Knife shaved noodles!",

The broths for both was really tasty, and the texture of the noodles was different than usual noodles Becuase of being hand made and cut. I recommend the \"knife cut\" noodle Becuase of its heavy chewy texture.   The meat and vegetables was good but not the very best. The bowl does contain a really big portion for only about $9. It's definitely worth coming here especially when it's almost winter time this place will get super busy.   I love the layout of the place very big bar seating and also spacious for rush hour times.

    "text": "I had this place bookmarked for the longest. I don't usually venture to this side of town but I decided to give it a try anyway.   Just an FYI - Parking sucks, not the restaurant's fault but it's very limited.  For starters, I asked for a water to drink. The waitress brings out what looks like water, but after the first sip (which I almost spit back into the cup because it grossed me out) I realized it was an infused water. I remembered another yelper posting a pic of their water which was very obvious that it had pieces of watermelon in it to show that it was infused.  Mine tasted more like it was infused with only the skin part of the watermelon. Gross. You've been warned.  The cucumber appetizer had a nice sesame based sauce to it with a very light drizzle of chili oil, but the way they have it stacked - the bottom pieces didn't have any flavor at all. It would have been better if the cucumbers were at least lightly pickled or marinated. Very bland.  Beef pancakes were good, they took 15min to make (and they did tell us) but came out nice and hot. They are very very juicy - seasoned just right. Dough is a little thick but this is typical.   Beef shank - soup base was very bland.  It was a very light white colored broth. It was literally 5 pieces of beef shank, some noodles and a pile of green onions.  Beef brisket - (I stole some of my wife's soup since mine was so boring) soup base was much better, had a darker red color with a little kick to it. But still dressed up with only some green onions.  I'll tell you where the was place really good, and that's their hand shaved noodles - the texture of the noodles with the intentional imperfect cuts was really great. It's just a shame that I had to use 3 spoonfuls of hot sauce to give my soup some flavor.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",

    "text": "We're on a journey to try all the noodle shops in Las Vegas.  We've been back 2 times to try other types of soup they have here.  One thing you'll notice coming here is how clean and the decor of this place.  Very modern.  They also serve you infused cucumber water!  Huge plus for the dry climate in Las Vegas.  The service is excellent here, you can't complain when a place refills your water without you asking.   We had two appetizer.  Spicy wonton, my husband really likes it.  Cucumber salad....it had a weird sesame drizzle sauce on it...it was WEIRD TASTING!  Don't order it.  LOL, I was craving The Noodle Man's cucumber salad.   Our noodle soups.  We're a big fan of their knife-shaved noodles.  We've tried the other two types of noodles.   They're great, but the texture of the knife-shaved noodles is very unique, never had that before.  I ordered the Beef Shank Noodle and Seafood Noodle.  They don't use any soy product in the broth.  Both broth super tasty, very clean with the texture of the knife-shaved noodle.  I just can't remember if the use the same broth or if they were different.  My husband ordered Shang Beef Noodle, Pork Belly Noodle, and Dan-Dan Noodles.  He really liked all of them.  He's a big fan of their Dan-Dan Noodles.    Another thing I couldn't forget was their hot tea.  It was so tasty, the pleasant roasted flavor was what got me.  I am super happy, I did a little investigation and found it without having to call and ask them what tea was.  I purchased 50 sachets.  =)",

Takes about 10 minutes to make. Yummy, fresh, flavorful, and very good.  Spicy wontons are also good but not as spicy as I thought they would be, but had very good taste, I was expecting it to burn my mouth with how red it looked.  Also had the tomato egg noodle, it was good but I think we would have enjoyed it more if we ordered the knife cut noodles.  If you're going to eat the noodles then I would recommend getting knife cut noodles. My mom loved this place so much she wants to come back and try everything else.",

I love their noodles, but as I get to try everything out, eventually I find my favorite or know what's the best for me.  I love their beef from Shang's Beef noodle, but I only love the clear broth (which only available with Beef shank order, but I don't like beef shank), so I asked the waitress if it's ok I have beef shang noodle meat but with clear broth like in the Beef shank one, she had done this for me before, and this time, she went and talk to the chef/owner Sam to see if it's possible to do it again, but to my surprise, chef immediately shake the head said \"no\", but I felt like the whole time, he doesn't bother to understand the question further, both waitress and I tried to explain to him, but he doesn't seems to get it at all, I told the waitress I'll just get something else, then she went back and talked to the chef again, she came out and said she'll be glad to do it for me again, but she already got the warning from chef/owner for doing this, REALLY? getting a warning for making customer happy? this is just NOT RIGHT! why would you give your employee an warning when all they want to do is make the food the way customer wanted, all they have to do is put in noodle, put in clear broth, and then shang beef meat on top of it(not to mention they are both the same price), I'm not even trying to be difficult, but the chef/owner made EVERYTHING difficult.  On top of that, the restaurant was so busy(but when we arrived there it wasn't busy at that time), with about 20 people and ONLY 1 waitress, I felt bad for the nice waitress, the restaurant clearly under staffed, it's employee abuse, she even corrected the chef couple of time when the chef made the mistake on the order, and she had to start asking for help because customers were not getting their order or they just seated themselves, because 1 waitress just can't handle 20 people at once (I don't blame her, I blame everything to the owner), I honestly think she should be the manager, or go somewhere else to work where they treat employee right.  This is unbelievable, they have lost another loyal customer, and many more, because I will share my experience with all my friends and will not recommend any of my friends there anymore.  Bye Shang! you had been good only when you fist open, and this is what happen when your ego gets too big, time to look for another noodle shop.  *by the way, don't bother getting their fried rice, the portion was soooo small, it's not even worth the price.  Don't get their spicy wonton and expect it to be spicy, it's not even spicy at all.",

We were told they had their soft opening about 2 weeks ago and they just had their grand opening on Thursday. My wife and I tried the Shang beef noodles. It was very good. The broth had a hint of sweetness to it. My wife likes their hand pulled noodles while I really like the knife cut noodles for a more al dente texture. They do make both types of noodles in house and if you're lucky, you can actually see someone hand pulling the noodles behind the clear plexiglass that divided the bar from the kitchen. They also have the plain noodles made by machines, but I don't know why anyone would want that instead of the freshly made noodles on site. I also had the Chicken and mushroom noodle which was also very good. We also tried their beef pancakes, pork and cabbage potstickers and the spicy wontons. The wontons had just a hint of heat to it and although they were all good, I think the homemade noodles is what makes this place different than others. The place itself is not very big but there weren't many people there so getting a seat was not difficult. I think the price is very reasonable considering the outrageous $$$ we've spent on the strip. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a restaurant to try a couple of miles off the strip.",

The broth was not too oily and salty, and the fatty beef cuts typical in Northern Chinese Beef Noodle Soup were tender and braised for hours as they should be. I dislike when some restaurants fail to fully marinate and braise the beef cuts leaving them dry and tough- not a problem here as Shang Noodles gets the combination of chewy soft noodle and braised beef just perfect. The beef pancakes were perfectly pan fried in fresh oil and fillings were juicy and savory.  If you sit at the bar seating area, you can watch a master chef actually performing dough kneading gymnastics to turn out heaps of fresh noodles- the chef we watched making noodles was obviously experienced and knew what he was doing and was very interesting to observe. This place is an excellent restaurant for Chinese Noodles.",

I was lucky to be their very first customer and I've got to say that this place is absolutely amazing great food , great prices, and great service.  I returned a few days later with my family my wife had the beef noodle soup I had the pork noodle soup and my son had the seafood noodle soup... all with the pulled noodles of course as they offer three different types of noodles.  You get to watch them actually pull and make your noodles in front of your eyes  Oh and I almost forgot order the pancake it's absolutely fabulous",

With my lack of knowledge and experience for the last decade with noodles please take this review with a grain of salt.   I honestly liked what I had but there's nothing to really compare it to because this is my first time going to a noodle shop in almost a decade.  The spicy wontons were definitely the highlight of the meal. The flavors from the wontons and the chicken chow mein were definitely not something you experience from an Americanized Chinese restaurant. There's definitely some authenticity to both dishes. My wife had a beef shank noodle dish with hand pulled noodles. She liked it. I had a small bite and didn't taste much flavor at which point my wife snipped at me and said I have no idea what I'm talking about. Which is a pretty accurate statement. Lol.  The lunch time wait wasn't that bad for us but when we left the line was pretty outrageous. I don't think any restaurant is worth waiting more than 30 minutes for because there is so many good dining options in Las Vegas. So if you get here and the wait is longer than 30 minutes, my advice is to go somewhere else and try another day.",

    "text": "What I ate: Shang beef noodle Visit Date: March 1, 2019 First time? Yes.  Behold, a rare 5-star review. You're gonna want in on this!  Shang Artisan Noodles is located off the Las Vegas strip and in small shopping/food plaza. It's worth the trip! Not only to they make and hand pull their noodles, they make them to order! In my hand-pulled noodle experience, I've come across noodles that are too thick or too chewy, but Shang has created the perfect noodle, AND, they have perfected their noodle dishes.   I got a bowl of the Shang beef noodles with hand-pulled noodles. We also shared the beef pancakes, spicy wontons, and chicken chow mein (also with hand-pulled noodles). The noodles pick up the flavors nicely.  The Shang beef noodles are made with beef and chicken broth and braised beef brisket. The spice/flavor combo was uniquely Shang, and the beef was so tender. The beef pancakes are more like hopya-shaped dumplings. They are filled and super juicy inside. The spicy wontons are house-made wontons with spicy soy sauce. I could inhale plates of this stuff. The chicken chow mein - stir-fried house-made noodle, chicken, and veggies. The sauce profile was sweet and salty.    You have your choice of noodles here - hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or regular. And you have your choice of sauciness - soupy, saucy, stir-fried. Next time I want to try their knive-shaved noodles(flat, wide noodles).OMG, take me back to Shang.   PS Sit at the bar for a noodle-pulling \"show.\"",

I've been here about two times, and either time I feel like I wasn't really expecting myself to eat here, but wound up eating here anyway because it was on the way home. The most recent time I was here, I had the beef shank noodle with a cup of tea, and while it hit the spot because it was warm and the noodles were fresh, it felt like the food didn't have much in the way of taste.   Even now, thinking back to it, I know that even milder Chinese food has heartier and tastier broth than what I had that day. By far the best part of Shang's are the noodles -- as they should be, since the kitchen and the marketing behind this place puts so much emphasis on the noodles being handmade.",

We had the shang(pork) fried Rice, the chicken mushrooms sauce noodles (hand carved) and the pork and cabbage dumplings. Everything had amazing seasoning and the noodles were out of the world.  We will be coming back when we return. DEFINITELY A MUST WHEN IN VEGAS!!!",

    "text": "Ugh. I cannot get enough of this place. Warning, the wait is ridiculous but WORTH IT. I would recommend arriving about 5 min before opening as to have no wait or going at an off time. We ended up going twice during our short trip to Vegas. The restaurant is small but very cute and clean. You can watch the cooks hand pull the noodles and also hand cut them as well. This place has a lot of hype for a reason as the food is very fresh and very flavorful.  Hand cut noodles vs. knife cut noodles: I found the hand cut to be a little more chewy and al-dente. The strands are longer and shaped like a traditional noodle (think spaghetti or lo-mien noodles). Knife cut noodles are shorter in strands, softer (because it's less worked), and thicker (think your traditional flat wide noodles). I actually preferred the knife cut noodles since they are easier to eat, and I personally like a softer noodle.   For the actual foods: Spicy wontons- 5/5 hot chili oil over a nice portion of fresh wontons.  Beef pancakes- 4/5 beware they are super hot inside. The meat/soup filling was almost too rich, but still really good.  Dan Dan Noodles- 4.5/5 one of the best Dan Dan noodles I've had. I appreciated that it was not overly peanutty in taste. Note: if you've never had Dan Dan noodles before they come cold! Pork Belly Soup- 5/5 so deep and flavorful and a huge portion Seafood Soup-3/5 probably the worst thing we got because the soup was a little bland but after adding some chili oil it was a lot better.   I honestly cannot wait to come back here and try everything on the menu. You won't regret trying this place out.",

Can totally see why this noodle joint has 4.5 stars with over 1200 reviews.  The noodles are hand made, service was fast, and quality was tasty.  Only thing is that spacing is limited, so it's not ideal for larger parties.  Party of 2-4 is ideal.    The beef or pork noodles are the best and paired with the cucumber salad is heaven!   If you're hungry and on the verge of \"hangery\" recommend you order 2 bowls. Yes, yes... 2 bowls!  =)  Can't believe we've never been here before.  Will def be a good alternative instead of having Pho when we're craving for some noodle soup.",

Someone from my party brought it up to their attention. But I think they were still hesitant to get that party to pay the bill and leave.   After we got seated service was quick. Food came out pretty fast. We had a party of 7. We ordered a few spicy wontons, a beef shank cold dish, a few Shang Beef Noodles, and Jia Jiang Noodles. The spicy wontons had a nice kick to it. Pretty flavorful little morsels packed with spices and beef. The Beef noodles with knife cut noodles were prefect. The beef was tender. The Jia Jiang was sweet. Comes with minced meat and a brown sweet sauce.   Overall I would definitely recommend this place.",

When we arrived, there was a few tables ahead of our party but we waited until a table was open. A couple sitting at a larger table noticed we were waiting and decided to move to a smaller table.  In addition to the complimentary water with cucumber and lemon, we ordered Sapporo's, Asahi's, and hot tea.   We shared a few appetizers including Spicy Wonton (as recommended by someone picking up a carryout order), Beef Pancakes, and Pork & Cabbage Potstickers. The Spicy Wonton consisted of pork and made in house, topped with scallions and sesame seeds, and served in a really spicy chili oil. The Beef Pancake consisted of four pancakes stuffed beef and scallion and pan-fried. It took about 10-15 minutes to make. The Pork & Cabbage Potsticker consisted of six pieces of pan fried dumplings filled with flavorful pork and cabbage. It also took 10-15 minutes. It was nicely presented - it looked like a flower.  They have multiple types of artisan noodles made in house. We tried two different noodle soups - Pork Rib Noodle Soup and Beef Shank Noodle Soup. The Pork Rib Noodle Soup consisted of pork and chicken broth, hand pulled noodles, braised pork rib, and assorted veggies. The Beef Shank Noodle Soup consisted of beef broth, knive shaved noodles, beef shank, and assorted veggies. I liked the hand pulled noodles more than the knive shaved noodles. I liked the hand pulled noodles  more because of the thinness and texture. The Tomato & Egg Rice consisted of stir fried tomato and scrambled egg in a tangy flavorful tomato sauce, garnished with scallions, and served with bok choy and steamed rice. I plan to return on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

I was hesitant at first to have noodle soup for lunch when it's 95 degrees outside but oh boy, this place exceeded my expectations. Was seated right away at the bar and after reading some Yelp reviews, I ordered the beef noodle soup and also their cucumber salad. Here's my review:  1. The cucumber salad was fresh and crispy and definitely a nice balance to the richness of the beef soup. I love the peanut and sesame oil dressing. I added some of the chili paste on the side and a small amount of soy sauce and it was heavenly.   2. The beef noodle soup was THE BOMB!!! This was probably the most flavorful beef soup I've had in a while. The noodles were freshly made, good amounts of beef (shank portion) and it was very tender. And I just love the simplicity of the garnish they added was just green onions and bokchoy because u can really taste the beef broth. It was just a very delicious homie soup.   I don't know but I may come back here tonight for dinner and try their other offerings. If u are looking for some good Asian noodle eats, THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!!",

Good thing because even though this was a day I expected no one would be out (it snowed in Vegas) it was jammed packed in here by 6!  Weeknight, early evening AND snow but still busy?  Very good sign.  We ordered the spicy wonton and cucumber salad to start.  Those wontons are absolutely fantastic.  The dough is soft and silky, the filling is delicious and the sauce is spicy with just the right amount of oil and vinegar.  Pure balance in a bowl.  We also got dan-dan noodles, pork belly noodles and beef shank noodles.  It was fun to try all the different ways they prepare the hand pulled noodles.  Every dish was full of flavor and complexity.    The service was great too.  They fully anticipated our needs, refilling drinks and clearing plates swiftly.  They never made us feel rushed either, even with the crowd waiting to get in.",

    "text": "I've never had Chinese hand pulled noodles before and my main squeeze has been eager to try for some time now so we decided to have a lunch date here. It's a pretty small place. There's bar seating and maybe 8 or 9 tables. There will probably be a bit of a wait, but I promise you, it's worth it.   A spicy wonton app to share and two Shang beef noodle soups, one with an extra noodle. They spicy wontons aren't super spicy. I liked them because of this-- you can eat without having your mouth set on fire. The filling and texture of the wonton were great. Don't be embarrassed to eat these with a fork if you aren't the best with chopsticks. They are slippery little buggers!   The soup was out of this world. Occasionally, I daydream about it. I feel like I'm being deceitful if I go without my partner in crime, so that's a (pathetic) reason why I haven't been back yet. Anywho, the noodles are fantastic; chewy but firm, easy to slurp, and are super fresh. The brother is rich without being heavy. I love the crunchy, crisp baby boks in there too. I considered ordering extra baby boks but I'm glad I didn't. It was unnecessary as the ratio of noodle to meat to baby bok to brother was just right. The beef was tender, flavorful and plentiful. It wasn't too fatty or lean.  All in all, it was a perfectly balanced bowl. I couldn't really ask for more in a noodle soup and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

It was a little out of the way since it was off the strip, but definitely worth the uber ride.   We order a little of almost everything. Got the potstickers, got some noodles, spicy wontons, and more. Everything we got came out quickly and it was all delicious. We came a little before lunch time so it was not as crowded, but when we left there was a wait for Sunday lunch. Service was good.   Concept very similar to Din Tai Fung with a few differences. Way cheaper compared to the bay area prices. Definitely coming back here again next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place is a definitive must whenever I visit Vegas. My friends and I dropped by on the way to the airport, luggage and all. Although the shop is small, our luggages fit perfectly underneath the table. Food comes out fast, and their broth is the perfect thing to rejuvenate you after a long weekend on the strip. Shang is so unique because of their kitchen layout, which allows you to watch the mesmerizing process of noodle pulling. They also have knife shaved noodles which I think are best paired with the soups.  Below are all of my favorites which I think are 5/5:  Shang beef noodle with knife shaved noodles- knife shaved noodles have the perfect bite to them, pure beefy flavor soup, tender brisket, with perfectly crisp bok choy  Dan Dan noodles with hand pulled noodles- both of my friends got this. Perfectly cooked noodles, super filling, and the sauce was really good too.  Beef pancake- be careful, these are hot when they come out! I can never resist the urge and end up burning my mouth every time. The best part about this is the crispy exterior and the amazing soup that bursts out when you first bite into it. Dip it into abit of the soy vinegar.  Spicy wonton- this is my OBSESSION. I try these everywhere I go but the only places that do it right is Shang and DTF. Wontons themselves are good, but the sauce with the scallions is what makes it amazing.   I literally can't even think of anything bad to say except maybe that the wait can get long depending on the time that you choose to go. On a Monday at lunch time, there was no wait at all when we arrived.   If anyone watches Strictly Dumpling and knows who Mike Chen is, stay tuned for what I imagine must be a Vegas food review video. I ran into him filming while eating here!",

    "text": "I went here today with a friend. They make their own noodles in house. They have 3 types. Hand pulled, knife cut and plain. Plain are thin like ramen noodle style, pulled are thicker and knife cut are flat noodle. The hand pulled and knife cut noodles are made in house and the plain are boxed noodles that are not made in house. These are the descriptions that the waiter gave me. So I ordered the chicken, mushroom and bok choy with a soy based type sauce with the hand pulled noodle. I chose the hand pulled noodle on the recommendation of the waiter due to 1 of 2 of the noodles that are made in house. I did like the noodles being freshly made and it had a lot of mushrooms (2 types - white mushrooms and wood ear mushrooms) with bok choy and scrambled egg and green onion with a soy base type sauce. I give the noodle dish a 3.5 star due to the sauce not being as flavorful. I had a similar dish somewhere else that the sauce was SO flavorful and made me want to eat the whole dish. I ate about half of my dish and took the rest home. I videotaped the noodle making and it was impressive. They make a regular flour noodle and a spinach noodle that I got to see. They also have noodle soups and fried noodle type dishes with appetizers and also fried rice dishes. They are very reasonably priced. It's a small place so the entire time we were there customers were always waiting to get seated. You can sit at the counter bar area where you get a close view of the noodle maker or sit and the very few tables they have. They had 2 wait staff working and were friendly and accommodating and were always around. The next time I go there I would like to try their noodle soups and appetizers. Overall I had a good experience.",

I will make an exception every time I visit Vegas lol. They have a perfect chewy texture that's so addicting.  For dinner, I tried the original beef noodle soup (dark broth) which was rich and flavorful. The waitress told me it is their most popular dish, and it doesn't disappoint. There is a good size portion of meat and noodles.  I also tried the spicy wonton, which are amazing. This might be blasphemy but I like them more than Din Tai Fung's.   For lunch the next day, I tried the dan-dan noodles, which don't come with broth, but instead has a thin sort of oily spicy sauce. This was actually my favorite. I believe it's the same sauce they use for their spicy wonton, and the minced meat complemented the dish well. I'll probably end up getting this again next time!  The cucumber salad side was also delicious and a great way to break the taste of the noodles a bit, and also cut the spice because the dan-dan noodles are pretty spicy!   Highly recommend this place! It's small but the wait doesn't seem too bad because the food comes out quickly and people don't take much time to finish their food.",

They offer traditional Taiwanese dishes like dan dan noodles, beef noodle soup and pancakes. Kinda of sad they didn't have the thousand year egg dish but I think they're main focus is the noods (like their business name advertises). I had the hand pulled pork belly noodle soup and it was everything I needed to make myself feel like home again. Noodles were soft and chewy and I love that I found a place that does hand pulled. They also offer knife cut and regular style noodles. The pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth.   I'll definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.",

It's not to long after that, another server asked for our drinks. We just ordered a glass of water and their water is so refresing. It's infused lemon & cucumber water. All their menu is remain me of my childhood food.  I like this place... the place is Clean, good food, good portion, good price, good service, fast service. It's not even 5 mins we got our food one by one, probably in 10mins we got all our food. Im so happy they serve my favorite taiwanese beef noodle soup. That is the reason I want to eat here. You can choose 3 type of noodle: hand pull, knife shave noodle, plain noodle.  We ordered:  * SHANG BEEF NOODLE W/ HAND PULL NOODLE $9.95 ( beef broth, braised beef brisket, bok choy)( I add spicy sauce that they have on table):  It's delicious-tender beef, a rich and slightly spicy broth, fresh noodles, a little bok choy. The result is a perfectly orchestrated bowl of spicy, savory, fresh deliciousness.  * Shang fried rice $9.95 (steamed rice, minced pork, egg, preserved bean sprout-I didn't notice but I saw preserved mustard green) : I like they put minced pork + mustard green (if I'm not mistaken) in there, that make this fried rice so tasty and colorful because they also put corn, carrot, peas. Even it's a little bit to salty for us but we finished it. * spicy wonton $5.99 (house-made wonton with spicy aoy sauce) : I like the fact that their wonton skin is not thick ( I don't like thick skin), good flavor meat + sauce, that's we call perfection  Overall really satisfied The price is not bad, all under $10. I think only 1 menu is $11 (seafood noodle). Big portion of all food, our beef noodle have a lot of big beef pieces. I can not wait to go back so I can try all their menu like dandan noodle, beef pancakes, chicken & mushroom noodle, tomato & egg rice, sliced beef shank, pork & cabbage pot sticker. I know it's a lot, right? You should come and try it",

    "text": "I found this place on Yelp and wanted to give it a try since they seemed reasonably priced, and the food looked pretty good.  My folks seemed reluctant to make the five mile drive from our downtown hotel, because they wanted the \"Fremont experience\",  but they came with.   AND GUYYYS, lemme tell you. No one was disappointed.  When you walk in, you see one of the employees making noodles by hand. The atmosphere is warm, cozy, and quiet and very different from the more \"lively\" restaurants we had dined at since our arrival, as well as the more \"curt\" customer service we were growing accustomed to in the area.   The service was fantastic! Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful in his recommendations.  The food was amazing. We all sampled one another's plates, and I'm just sad our hotel didn't have a fridge so I could order more to take back to enjoy later.   Even the Chow Mein was delicious!  Mind you, chow mein is a dish I've eaten countless times at countless restaurants over time, and while good, is usually unremarkable, BUT THEIR CHOW MEIN IS LITERALLY THE BEST CHOW MEIN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  And by the end of it all, between three orders of appetizers, and entrees for six people, our tab was still less than $80. The whole reason I decided to look into this place in the first place was because price was such a big factor at the time, and it still surprised me that we ordered so much food, each dish being INCREDIBLY delicious,  for such a fantastic price.   Y'all. I'm so sad I'll never have noodle dishes this amazing until I'm back in Las Vegas (whenever  that will next be ;c ).  SERIOUSLY. GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY. YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE.  This place is such a gem.",

However the decor, service, and cleanliness is all there for an asian restaurant.  The hubs and I got: 1. Spicy oil wontons - really good flavors and lots of green onions! Highly recommend it 2. Beef shank noodles soup- we got the hand pulled noodles but it was made too soft and not chewy. The soup base was nice and soft.  3. I got the seafood noodles soup with the same noodles. The flavors of the soup was great but the noodles were lacking.  We also paid $1 more for 2 more bok choy . They should just have a side of bok Choy dish instead!   I hope the soup is not made from msg because I drank a lot of it.  Probably wouldn't come back",

I don't have much knowledge on Chinese food so brought along some friends with more experience and let them do the ordering.   The spice is real! Or maybe I really am that big of a spicy wimp, but some of the dishes were too spicy for me to dig in the way these dishes deserved. For a place that prides itself on their handmade noodles, the delivered! You could tell they were fresh! The beef was stewed to perfection and fell apart. My favorite was the beef pancakes!   If you can handle spice better than me (pretty much everyone), stop by and check out some great Chinese noodles!",

    "text": "Adding to the cascade of 5 star ratings because our photos of the food look amazing!  Shang Artisan is a small spot off the strip with a small, concise menu. We arrived at around 4:00 on a Monday and the place wasn't busy at all, there was a steady flow but always available tables. We asked for a counter spot to watch them make the food; one fellow makes the wontons by hand and the nood dude does his thing, it's pretty entertaining (and he's a good sport with photos and videos too).  Based off the other Yelp reviews, we ordered the beef soup -one hand pulled and one knife shaved, the beef pancakes, and the spicy wontons. We had super high expectations and they didn't disappoint! Beef soup: Super rich but not oily or heavy, we were surprised at this because the broth is really dark and there are generous amounts of brisket floating around. Dat brisket doe! It was soft, tender, and flavorful.  Hand-pulled noods: nicely balanced. Long strands with a soft bite.  Knife-shaved noods: chewier bite with shorter pieces. I initially preferred this as I like chewier textures but as the meal sat they got a tad bit overwhelming, there was a lot leftover (enough to fill a small takeout container with just the noodles.  Beef pancakes: these are the title round dumpling looking fellas and True to all the reviews and waiter's caution, they definitely do squirt. Every. Single. One. These were so so good though, so definitely worth it!  Spicy wontons: I think it's just the chili oil but they really are spicy! I'm a lightweight though and only eat spicy if I'm behind on my daily water intake or need to induce labor so I'm not the authority you're looking for. The wonton itself was really really good!  Stop in, it's a nice break from the strip and really simple, good food!",

There are about 12-15 seats at the bar.  We ordered the Beef Pancake (comes in 4 pieces), Pork Belly Noodle Soup & Peking Zha-Jiang Noodles. Our server let us know the beef pancakes would take 10 minutes and if that was okay. We didn't think that was a long wait and it was nice they gave us a warning, so we said okay. To our surprise, our noodles came out within five minutes of ordering! The beef pancake came out around the time they mentioned.   The noodles were great. They were fresh and very tasty!

I ordered the wonton soup with added hand-tossed noodles, and shared the cucumber salad appetizer and fried rice with my husband and our awesome friend/realtor. It was really cool watching the staff stretch the noodles and toss them around like they're just playdoh. We were joking that they probably don't have to go to the gym since they spend their whole day doing that at work.  I'm a convert and will probably be open to trying any other fresh noodle place I see now. This was a great find!",

After several visits we discovered the spicy wontons which are small bites of heaven. Currently we devour the chicken chow mein which is fantastic. Crispy vegetables with wok fried chicken and the knife shaved noodle. If you have not tried it you must consider it. We have been fortunate several times to have Lindsey as our server and she is fantastic! We enjoy Shang so much it has become a staple of our lunch rotation.",

There were 4 of us who normally love noodles and none of us were satified. My sister and I got dan dan noodles, shang beef noodles, beef pancakes, and potstickers to share. The beef pancakes were ok, nothing special, just tasted like over-thick potstickers. The potstickers were just ok as well; I've had better. Both noodle dishes were not great. We didn't finish our food and I wouldn't even take it home because I knew I wouldn't eat it again (and I hate wasting food - and money!) Very disappointed. The reviews and photos made it look so good.... All we could talk about after were all the great noodle places in town we would've rather eaten at.",

The spicy wonton had a great spice and the beef pancake was definitely a crowd favorite!  The noodles were cooked to a good consistency and were tasty.

They also made them three different ways. 1-flat 2-shaved, and 3- regular. I highly recommend this restaurant. 3-5pm is the best hours. They also close at 10pm which is great! Super affordable!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here three times when we were visiting Las Vegas a few weeks ago.  I mentioned to my husband that I found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it because the reviews were pretty good for this restaurant.   ATMOSPHERE: Welcoming and clean atmosphere.  There's an open kitchen to watch them make the noodles and cook your food.    It feels so exciting to be able to watch someone making hand pulled noodles.  You can choose three types of noodles:  hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or plain noodle.  If you want to order extra noodles, it's an extra charge of $1.50.    I wanted to give 5 stars overall, but couldn't.  For the service, I would definitely give 5 or more stars, but for the food, I couldn't.    SERVICE:   Definitely 5/5 stars.  If I could give more stars, I would. The service here is exceptional!  Best service ever!  I wouldn't write this if this wasn't True.  I'm very picky about service.  If the service is not good at an establishment/business, most of the time I dread to return or would not return to that establishment or business.    1st day - There were a lot of people waiting outside.  Found out that there were two large parties.  The restaurant is not that big.  I think it fits about 30 people.  We waited for about 20 minutes or so for a table.   Both of the servers working that night were very nice, courteous and friendly.  They asked if we needed anything several times even though they were very busy.    2nd day - We were greeted by a different server and he was also very nice, courteous and friendly.  He provided excellent service to us.   He also asked us several times if we needed anything.   3rd day - We were greeted by one of the same server from the 1st time we dined and he again welcomed us with a smile.  We definitely felt welcomed and was provided excellent service again.  FOOD:  -  Shang Beef Noodles $9.75 with Knife-Cut Noodles 1st and 2nd times were 5/5.  The knife-shaved noodles were chewy and the plain noodle (almost like spaghetti type pasta) had good texture.   The soup had a lot of beef flavor and was piping hot.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  We added extra noodles every time.    I couldn't wait to eat it again for the 3rd time, but the 3rd time, the soup was not hot and the noodles were soggy.  I was very disappointed.  I felt nauseated afterwards because I ate it lukewarm.  If my food is supposed to be hot in temperature, I need it to be piping hot.  My husband was ok with it. ___________________________________________  - Chicken Chow Mein $8.75 - 2/5 The first bite I ate was good, but then I realized that it was a little too saucy.  I think it would've been better if it was cooked a little longer.  It needed the high fire flavor too.     - The hot sauce in the jar on the table lacked flavor.    Just a thought:  I didn't like the fact that the workers in the kitchen do not wear gloves.  There's sometimes more than one person touching the noodles too.  A person would grab the noodles with their hands and place the noodles into a serving bowl.   Thinking about this, it's not sanitary.  It'll be better if the noodles are cooked and immediately put into the serving bowl.    Overall, I would definitely come back especially for the service.  Next time, I would request for my food to be piping hot.",

The knife cut noodles were on the short but chewy side. Personally I would go with the knife cut noodles. The beef shank noodle was pretty good 4.5/5. The broth was nice and smooth and the beef shank wasn't over cooked. The Dan Dan noodles were pretty good. Same with 4.5/5. It had a nice consistency with the knife cut noodles. The spice is not really a ma la type but it hits you right away. The chicken and mushroom noodle were 3/5 it lacked flavor and wasn't very great. The Shang beef noodle was greatly good with a 4.5/5 wish the noodles could've been more chewy but still long. The noodles was lacking salt and wasn't stir fried but it wasn't also in a soup. The sauce was like a gravy that didn't really fit up to expectations. The cucumber salad is 4/5 the sauce isn't too overpowering.",

Watching them make them from scratch was pretty cool sitting at the bar though.  1st - ordered the beef shang noodle soup and the noodles were al dente just the way i like it. The broth was delicious but a bit watery. It was still super tasty.  2nd - ordered the pork and cabbage boiled dumpling and the fried ones. It seemed to doughy and too thick. Overall, seemed kind of bland.  3rd - service was super friendly and quick on the service. The place is really clean and a bit small.  If your in town, i recommend trying this place.",

Then they just  stared at us. I looked over at the register and there was a sign that said \"sign in and wait to be seated\". I felt like I was in a doctors office.  Finally a young girl seated us and immediately wanted to take our order. She must have seen the look on our faces because then she asked if she could get us something to drink. We ordered iced tea and it came in a bottle.  She never came back. So so far I just wanted to leave.  Finally a young man with a big smile came and took our order and was very helpful. That was the best noodle soup ever!! The broth was so rich and delicious. Lots of handmade noodles and tender pieces beef. The prices are great and portions are wonderful. I ordered the beef and added wonton for $2. I thought I was going to get one wonton but I got at least 4! We will definitely be back this winter for a lot more bowls!!!!",

Although some of the workers weren't Asian, it felt pretty authentic Asian noodle joint to me. There is bar seating so you can feel ok coming to eat here alone! I saw a couple of people dining alone, which is something I never see in America. It was nice :) There are three types of noodles: hand pulled noodle, knife shaved noodles and plain noodles. The hand pulled and knife shaved are made fresh in the restaurant. The plain noodles are not. The hand pulled are your classic noodles, the knife shaved are thick gooey pieces. They recommend getting the broth noodles with the hand pulled and the sauce with the knife shaved. The knife shaved, however were not that great. They were too sticky and ended up being a thick mooshy thing at the bottom of the bowl. Be boring and get the hand pulled.  They recommend Shiang beef noodles for broth based and the chicken mushroom noodles for the sauce based. Both were really, really good and not spicy. Again, get the hand pulled! Sit at the bar to get the best video for your snapchat. The restaurant is small and gets pretty crowded. You might have to wait a little so come at off peak hours!",

Didn't have to wait in line and seating is specious enough you won't feel uncomfortable.   We ordered a Yang-Zhou fried rice and seafood noodle soup. When the food came we're little shock  inside. The fried rice has great presentation, but it cost $9 for a small portion. For lunch, at a local noodle shop, this just made us kind of disappointed. The noodle soup was served in reasonable portion. The soup base was delicious! The hand pulled noodles has good texture to it too.   The restaurant is very clean and pleasant overall and service was great. Just think they should reconsider how much they're charging for their fried rice, or should give a bigger portion at least. Everything tastes great though! I'll consider come back for the noodles.",

But after eating their Zha-Jiang noodles, Bian Bian Noodle, and their Shang Artisan Noodle, I was surprised with actually how good it tasted. We chose the hand-pulled noodles for all of them and the noodles were great! Not floury and I love the texture and the thinness. Their popular beef pancakes were spectacular, the juice of the beef still remains inside the pancake, which makes it taste amazing. I would definitely be back again but unfortunately I was just there for vacation.   To back my review, my dad is very critical of Chinese restaurants that are \"Americanized\" yet he ate the noodles with no complaints.   And so this place deserves their high ratings.",

    "text": "After two visits, I've tried a nice selection of their offerings with clear favorites, though, I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu! There are three types of noodles that you may choose when ordering any of their noodle dishes; Knife-Shaved, Hand-Pulled, or Plain. I'm not familiar with Plain, but I like both of the other options.  Spicy Wonton ($5.49) Beef Pancake ($5.49) Shang Beef Noodle ($8.95) Dan-Dan Noodle ($7.99) Chicken Sesame Cold Noodle ($7.99) Chicken & Mushroom Noodle ($8.49) Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle ($8.49) Shang Fried Rice ($7.99)  So far, my favorites are the Spicy Wonton, Beef Pancake, Shang Beef Noodle, Chicken & Mushroom Noodle, and Shang Fried Rice.  The Spicy Wonton are small delicious dumplings in a flavorful spicy soy sauce. What I really love about this dish, besides being tasty, is that it's not overly spicy. The sauce is really quite fantastic and goes well with so many of their other dishes!  I love the broth in the Shang Beef Noodle; it's rich and flavorful and the braised beef brisket is so incredibly tender. I had this soup with the knife-shaved noodles and it was perfection. I love the chewiness of the knife-shaved noodles and it's supported well with a broth rather than a sauce (it needs the additional moisture).  Another noodle dish I enjoyed is the Chicken & Mushroom Noodle. I appreciated how saucy it was since I wanted to pair it with the knife-shaved noodles. We added the sauce from the Spicy Wonton and it was so, so good!  I haven't tried their other rice dishes yet, but I really like the Shang Fried Rice because they use preserved bean sprouts and minced pork and these ingredients lend a wonderfully unique flavor.  I didn't love the Chicken Sesame Cold Noodle or the Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle. Both have rather viscous sauces and didn't work well with the hand-pulled or knife-shaved noodles. It needed more liquid or simply more sauce for better coverage. Also, flavor-wise, it was okay.  It is a small space, so get here early for lunch or expect a short wait (especially for larger groups). Service is fantastic and it's always an exciting experience since you have the ability to watch the chefs pull noodles, shave noodles, etc.",

The problem is that this place is a fraud and there's nothing \"artisan\" about it.  You'll come in and be dazzled by some idiot pulling noodles by hand and bouncing it on a table making noises that grab your attention.  Real places like this in China and I mean from Shanghai to Zhejiang.   NO ONE BANGS THE NOODLES ON THE TABLE!  LOL. So why do I call their BS?  A skilled noodle puller, (go search one on youtube) although does it by hand, the noodles width is reasonably consistent. This is important so that they cook evenly.    First time I came here I sent my bowl back and asked for the regular noodles.  The hand pulled crap they make is laughably inconsistent. Obviously thinner areas were overcooked, and thicker areas were raw.  Why I come back is that they put the customer first and if you hate something for any reason they will make it right.  Go there, and try the regular beef noodle with the hand pulled, then laugh and send it back and ask them for the machined pasta.  So much better, so much more consistency in each bite.  I didn't like their other stuff like the cold dan dan noodles. Which for me is misleading.  Dan Dan Noodles are warm and spicy with a peanut sauce.  They gave me something that was cold with carrots?  I only go back for the number 1 with regular noodles. If that is all they sold, I'd actually give them the other two stars.",

Even though they were spicy the wontons were out of this world delicious. My husband got the shang beef noodle with hand pulled noodles and it was really good. I ordered the pork belly with hand pulled noodles and I wasn't a fan of it at all. I only ate 3 or 4 bites of mine and filled up on the declious wontons and my husband leftovers which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I'd absolutely come back here for the dumplings and beef noodle soup.",

I had the chicken chow mein and we shared the pork cabbage dumplings. The food, atmosphere and service were fantastic. We highly recommend!",

The noodle items had you pair a deep and unctuous broth and a choice of noodle, hand-pulled and knife-shaved, I personally preferred the knife-shaved for the large and chewy texture however the hand-pulled were great as well. The main aspect of this place was the fact that they have an open kitchen that is connected to the bar seating so you can watch them make the noodles, dinner and a show if you will. Appetizers/sides were really yummy as well, most were succulent, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The interior was small yet modern, service was good, and they even serve cucumber water! The best part of the experience was that everything was reasonably priced, $8-9 for a noodle dish and $5-6 for the appetizer/sides. My friends and I had a wonderful time dining here and I will definitely be back.",

Love the show of tossing, twisting and turning the glob if pasta into noodles as well as scraping pieces off the chunk of pasta into boiling water. We had the beef with home made noodles, had spicy wonton and let tell you, it was one of more spicy wontons I had.  Also had the chicken chow mein with knife cut noodles.  The texture of the noodles were totally different than I have ever had.  Everything good, nothing bad. You have to try for yourself. I went (3) times during my stay there and if you are (1) person it is a quick sitting. Son's girlfriend was so into the noodles she order to go and flew home for her mom to get the flavor of the food. Excellent.",

Not the best beef noodle I've ever had, actually slight disappointed in the beef noodle meat itself, although the noodles are great.  But they have the best spicy wontons for sure.  I can eat like 2 bowls of those.  The 3 different kinds of noodles are all great.  The dumplings aren't my favourite even though I am a HUGE fan of dumplings, their dough skins are too thick for me.  It's good for pan fried, but not good for steamed.  The beef pockets are good and I even like their seafood option of noodles.  They're all pretty good, but just wish their beef noodle meat quality is a little better.  The broth is good.  Such a clean place and clean kitchen (unlike some of the restaurants in Chinatown), love to watch the chefs do their work, especially the older guy wrapping dumplings all the time.    I am glad this place exists in Vegas...and still continue to hunt for better beef noodle soup somewhere in the valley.  But definitely go for their spicy wontons!",

Its so fun to watch the noodles being made, so i sit at the bar to have entertainment while I eat. There are also tables along the wall also. Super cute place, friendly and super fast service. Can get packed, but they usually have a fast client turn over.",

We ordered the cucumber salad, beef pancakes, their beef noodle soup w/ hand pulled noodles and their chicken and mushroom noodle with chef noodle.   -The cucumber salad was refreshing.   -The beef pancakes was served immediately off the frying pan so it was hot but also really good.  They have sauces on the table side for you. -The beef noodle soup was what I expected (really good).  The hand pulled noodles was soft and bouncy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. -The chicken and mushroom noodle was good.  It was served in a sauce that I can't describe.  Not as good as the beef noodle soup.  We came here Saturday noon time for lunch and it was about a 20 minutes wait.  We took a Lyft here but there looks to be ample parking.",

Beef pancakes are fantastic - nice and juicy with flavorful meat interior and a crispy dough exterior.    I prefer din tai fung's spicy wontons to Shang, but they were good if that's your thing.   Not spicy enough for me...so added lots of chili oil.  The Shang beef noodle soup was excellent, but as I mentioned before, the hand pulled noodles are better - my BF got them so I stole a few bites.",

    "text": "So some friends were in town and one of them actually told me about Shang Artisan Noodle. She actually heard from another friend who said it was worth going to and we needed to hit it up. It doesn't take much to convince me to eat some noodles so before we knew it we all hopped in a midsized Subaru and tore off towards the strip.  Shang's is in a small-ish plaza, but is pretty easy to find. I noticed that it had a banner outside proudly declaring \"NOW OPEN\". Isn't it funny how a lot of restaurants out in Vegas seem to have that \"NOW OPEN\" banner above their doors even if they've been \"NOW OPEN\" for over a year? It's kind of like how Kohl's always seems to always have a sale going on where they can offer you 30% off sweaters then after you buy everyone in your family a sweater (including nana) they throw Kohl's cash at you too? What? How does their business model work? Either their sweaters dissolve when wet or the sale or \"Now Open\" banner is some kind of gimmick.   Anyways I digress.... Oh wait! One more...what's the deal with Bed Bath and Beyond and their cardboard coupons they mail you every month that give you like $10 off purchase of $50 that you can use even after their expiration date?  Anyhow, Shangs.....We went on a Friday afternoon between lunch and dinner so it wasn't too crowded. Busy, but we were seated immediately. The ambiance was nice. I liked that you can see a tired young man, let's call him Philippe, behind a glass wall twirling and pulling fresh noodles and another older guy, let's call him Reggie, cooking up said noodles for various customer orders. It gave the impression of \"fresh\" or we couldn't afford a wall so we put in a window to save on construction costs.  Anyways, here's what we ordered and what I thought about them:  Cucumber Salad - Meh. The cucumbers were fresh and the sesame sauce was sweet, but overall it wasn't really anything to write home about. You can skip this one and save precious stomach space for something else. Spicy Wonton (Hot) - This was delicious. It wasn't really spicy, but spiciness is kind of subjective. The wontons tasted great and the last one didn't get soggy so its structural integrity never came into question. Pork Belly Noodle - GET THIS! WOW this was really tasty. If you like pork this will not disappoint. If you don't like pork get this anyways and you may become a believer. The pork pieces were generous and marinated thoroughly. I got the hand pulled noodles because I wanted to ensure that  Philippe's future employment remained secure. The noodles tasted great! Not too starchy, not too soft, and just the right chewiness. The bok-choy tossed in complimented the dish well. Dan-Dan Noodle (HOT) - This was spicy. Good, but since it's more of a sauce noodle and I lean toward soup noodles it's ranked lower than the Pork Belly Noodle. I also prefer my pork in bigger chunks and not minced. Pork and Cabbage Pot Stickers - Meh...these were okay. Better and way fresher than the ones you'd get from the frozen food section of the 99Ranch, but okay overall. Like the cucumber salad you can skip these and save stomach real estate for something else.  Overall the late lunch was pretty satisfying. I'll definitely hit up Shang's again if I'm not in the mood for Ramen, but the Pork Belly Noodle was so good that I think depending on how I felt I'd probably prefer it over Ramen. So I guess it'd be like weather dependent - Cold, rainy, gloomy then you go Japanese Ramen (Sora, Monta Raman, or Ramen Tatsu). Mild, sunny \"casual shorts and T-shirt\" weather then you go Shang Artisan Noodle.",

To be clear, nothing was bad, it just didn't WOW or scream 4-5 Star awesomeness.  The best aspect for sure are the fresh noodles.  Then the beef in the Shang Noodles were tender and tasty.  From there, it drops.  The broth is surely not of the taiwanese deep beefy taste nor spicy, so be warned and you my like it better here.  It was a-ok and slightly sweet.  As the lower reviews note, the beef pancake while comes pipin hot and juicy, lacks flavor.  It's quite forgettable.  The spicy wontons are just way too small and seems like they try and hide that fact with a strong pepper lacing.  The sauce was also sweeter then I prefer.  Surely I am jaded as we eat this type of fair all over Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Asia.  The prices here are decent which reminded me of mom and pop joints in Asia, but it won't match the taste if you have the same type of expectations.  Great and happy service here to be sure.  Bright, and clean joint.  Glad this place is great for many many people, but surely it will miss for many others.",

The pot stickers were pan fried dumplings (yes, there's a difference). The pork belly noodle was with knife noodle and the only downfall was the pork belly was a bit overcooked. The Shang beef noodle was with pulled noodle and probably one of the best noodle soup I had in USA so far.  I would definitely come back to try other items and would recommend to others.",

The beef pancakes were a little smaller than my expectations but flavor was good! I would come here everyday if I live in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Wow. WOW. That beef noodle soup broth was perfect. Having been to Taiwan almost every other year growing up, I can say that this beef broth was special. I kid you not, I drank that whole bowl of soup dry. The beef brisket was tender and had a generous portion of it. Boy choy added a nice touch and was the perfect amount of crunch. I opted for hand pulled noodles and it was amazing to see your noodles being made in front of you. To be honest, these hand-pulled noodles weren't my preference of choice but still was great.   The beef pancake was delicious, as well. Be aware of the amount of soup/juice held inside when you take the first bite.   Spicy wonton was good. The wrapper was the special super thin type and was made well. The meat was good too, but my preference is more meat like Din Tai Fung's. The sauce had a spicy kick to it and again, this comes down to preference, but I do like Din Tai Fung's spicy wontons better.  However, that beef noodle soup sold me. I even told my parents about it later because it was that good. I will definitely be back.  Also, service was great! The young man was attentive and friendly. Ambiance and presentation of everything was great with wooden tables and chairs, quality wooden chopsticks and spoons. Bathrooms were clean and there's two big outside picnic tables for the waiting. Pricing is reasonable too. I'll see you again, Shang!",

While the dan dan noodles were great, the beef noodle soup was truly phenomenal - complex flavors, tender beef, and chewy, wide noodles.

It's a CLEAN, non typical Asian restaurant. I'm Asian, but I can't do \"authentic\" Asian restaurants, they skeeve me out and I can't enjoy the food when the interior is dirty/not modern/however you want to describe it, everyone knows what I mean.  It's located in a sketchy neighborhood, in a sketchy plaza, but the inside is nice and clean and has an overall nice vibe.  Other than that, I can only repeat what all the other Yelpers have to say, good food, reasonably priced, very quick to come out, servers are nice and attentive. Luckily for us, we have never had to wait very long...we must have great timing.",

We got sat and couple minutes later the waiter come around and ready to take our order. Great, cos we are hungry. We order the shang beef stew and seafood noodle. We also order spicy wonton as our app.  Food came out pretty quick. Love it! We tried the food. First bite, second bite. Slurp the soup, slurp again. Nahhh.... this restaurant just not for meh. The soup too bland for me. But the beef stew was perfect.  The waiter never came back to check on us after he dropped the noodles but The bill came out right before I finished my meal. That's mean he paid attention only to make us to leave because there was so many customer waiting on the list. Oh, one thing. We were to hungry that we dont even bother to complain that there was a hair on our spicy wonton.",

Walked in and waited to be seated however no one at the host stand and servers were busy catering to the customers until I finally flagged someone down and said I just need a seat for one and was promptly seated at the bar where there were plenty of open spots.   Rocky start at the beginning but customer service got alot better once seated.     Was quickly greeted and I placed my order.    The sliced beef shank first came out, within a few minutes and there were several slices on the plate with a Balsamic sauce.   It was tasty and reminded me of traditional Chinese style beef like this.  It is served cold, and firm yet easy enough to pull apart.   Hard to describe.     Next up came the hand pulled pork belly noodles.  Great noodles and the large chunks of pork belly were tasty.  Generous portion in the bowl and I actually put some of the shank beef in my soup.    Broth was good and server made sure to check up on me more than once and also kept my water cup full.   Definitely kudos for coming to check on me throughout my meal.     Great place to check out if you are in the area.",

There was a mild wait when we got there, which I usually take as a good sign that the place makes good food.   I ordered the pork belly noodle with pulled noodles. My mom got the pork rib with regular noodles. My brother for the beef shank with pulled noodles, and my boyfriend got the Shang beef with knife cut noodles. The best part about having a larger party means I can try out more than just one dish. I personally think the best broth was pork and chicken.  It's so flavorful and complex. The beef broth is good, but the pork and chicken is better. All types of noodles were great, even the regular noodles. I think the best noodles surprisingly was the knife cut noodles. They're thicker thin noodles, so the broth has more surface area to attach to.   If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely come back.",

The Shang Braised Beef Noodle Soup has a deep flavor without being too salty or oily, which is a fatal flaw of many beef noodle soups. Just one scoop of the house chili sauce really elevated the flavor as well! I loved the knife cut noodles, but they could have had a bit more \"chew\" to them.  The Beef Shank Noodle Soup is a clear broth and therefore lighter. It still tastes good, but if you're a fan of bolder/meatier flavors, I would recommend sticking with the Shang Braised Beef Noodle Soup.",

    "text": "So I had been wanting to give this place second chance since so many people seem to like it.  I also had been having hardcore beef noodle soup cravings, and the last time I went somewhere they fell short on the broth.   I remembered enjoying the broth the last time I came here, it was more the noodle execution and meat portion that had fallen flat.  I was determined that last time was a fluke, and I would experience the sheer joy everyone else seems to be from this place.  I tend to hold a lot of stock in a well developed broth,  so I had hope.   I asked the difference between the braised beef and the beef shank soup.  The broth is deeper in the braised beef and there is more meat.  My goal was to have more meat,  so I hoped for the best by choosing the braised beef.   I also tried the hand pulled instead of knife cut noodles this time.  The broth is still super yummy here, the noddles were a little better too this time around, and most importantly there was more meat for sure.   I still have had better noodles at another business in town, but overall prefer this locations soup.  Currently I feel they have the best beef soup in las Vegas.",

Shang Artisan Noodle is located in a small plaza next to a boba shop and Thai restaurant.  We were craving some comfort food since it was a chilly Saturday afternoon.    So glad we decided to eat somewhere off the LV strip.  This noodle restaurant is small so expect a wait during certain times.  We were seated within 10 minutes even during the lunch rush.  The staff are so friendly.  They checked on us many times during our meal.    We ordered: Shang beef noodle and the Peking wonton soup both with hand pulled noodles.   The broth for the beef noodle was savory.   The wonton soup had a lighter broth but still tasty.  We enjoyed our lunch to the last slurp.    Will definitely come back whenever we're in town again!",

In LA, we have so many choices available from dan-dan noodles to Chongqing to ramen and everything in between that I'm not sure this place would even rank anywhere as high here as it does in Vegas.  People raving about this place like it's something amazing boggles my mind all because, what, you can see the noodles being made in front of you? Bro, places like that are scattered throughout our Chinese ethoburbs in SoCal. C'mon now.  The wait was ridiculous for something this average. The texture of the noodles were good but the overall flavors weren't there. My husband got the Seafood Noodle, which was bland and pretty disappointing. I ordered their Dan-Dan Noodles- too salty, partly because there were barely any noodles to balance out all that sauce. The portions are just stingy in general.  Maybe I should've gotten more popular items but if this is supposed to be such an awesome place, shouldn't everything taste good? The service was solid and quick but I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Vegas' Chinatown may not be as aesthetically pleasing nor have as much history as SF's, but it sure as hell has a lot tastier restaurants.  While the Strip itself has such great restaurants, I've always wished that I was able to venture off the Strip more to get tastier food and more for my money. Luckily, I still have one close friend that lives in Vegas, so when we're able to meet up sometimes we spend time off the Strip.    She picked me up from the airport and it was perfect timing and asked what I wanted to eat for lunch.  I asked if we could go to Spring Mountain since there were some noodle places I wanted to try.  She agreed and the restaurant opened a few minutes before we arrived.  There were already two tables occupied and in no time it was full.    It was a breezy cold day so I knew that noodle soup was the way to go.  I asked the waiter his recommendation between the beef soup and the pork belly and he said definitely the beef.  I usually prefer other noodle soups over beef, but have been seeing all the drool worthy beef pics, plus I did ask him for his opinion.  We both ended up getting the beef noodle soup and shared the potstickers and spicy wontons.  She got the hand pulled noodles while I got the knife cut noodles.  We actually got our wontons and potstickers after our noodles, so not ideal, but that's ok.  The broth was well flavored, lots of depth and didn't feel oily and the beef was tender and moist.  Nothing beats fresh homemade noodles!  While their knife cut noodles were good, mine ended up being more knife shaved short noodles vs. the longer strands of knife cut or Biang Biang noodles that I've seen on others' Yelp photos and Instagram accounts.  The bowl also came with bok choy and a lot of green onions.  I was amused as I watched my friend who hates green onions pick all of them out of her bowl.  To be fair, the menu did not note this, so be aware there's green onions oh plenty in most of their dishes I believe.  I think one of things I always wish with beef noodle soup was that the muscley connective tissue part could be removed before serving to make it easier to eat.  I'm not a Taiwanese beef noodle soup connoisseur at all, but I'd have to say the best I've had is at Bing's in Fremont, CA, but Shang Artisan's is trailing just behind.  I really enjoyed their crispy AF bottom potstickers and their chili wontons were perfect, and packed a punch.    We were stuffed and had to take leftovers of the potstickers and chili wontons back to my hotel room.  The noodle dishes were under $10 and the dumplings were under $6, so it's super wallet friendly and delicious.  Shang Artisan I'll definitely try to come back next trip out and would love to try some other noodle dishes.  Shang Artisan, can you consider opening up location number 2 in the Bay?  I'd visit you more than my local noodle spot, I promise!",

    "text": "Yeah, I tried to get a cheap meal in Vegas and still spent over $40.  I'm not really sure why we went to Shang Artisan Noodles.  We have a few noodle shops in Southern California that hand pulls their noodles.  We arrived at about 7PM.  We were seated after about 10 minutes at the bar with a great view of the noodle maker himself.  We ordered their pork belly noodles, a beef stew noodle, beef pancake, and a pan fried dumping.  The food came out pretty quick.  The noodles were okay.  My wife and daughter thought the pork belly noodles had a sweet, not in a good way, flavor to it.  The beef stew noodles were decent.  I've had better in Socal.  The noodles were okay, it seemed starchy and like a white flour overload to me.  The pork belly noodles made the beef stew taste good.  Pan fried dumplings were unique in presentation, but okay.  The beef pancake was a nice juicy mess.  They were good.  But they exploded when you bit into it and ruined a vacation shirt on my first night. It's an okay place if you want Chinese northern noodles.",

Although the restaurant is unassuming from the outside, once inside you are immediately greeted with a full open kitchen where you can watch the noodles being hand made, a True art form in itself.   Most importantly though, the bold and unique flavors of the various dishes are definitely worth a visit!",

The Dan Dan noodle sauce was a bit spicy but if you would rather have more noodle and minced pork than a broth soup, it's the way to go. My only disappointment was the space in the restaurant and parking arrangements. If you can look past that and the quality of the food alone, I would give 5 stars. Their location however definitely needs an improvement as soon as they are able. Visit here and you won't be disappointed.",

The chef or the cook is doing all sorts of tricks with the noodle dough, twisting and turning it like a giant accordion.   On to the actual noodles themselves...Tried the beef noodle soup and the Dan Dan noodles both with the hand pulled noodles. The beef noodle soup was solid. The noodles had the right texture and consistency but not the most flavorful broth that I've had. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles. The minced pork combined with the sichuan peppers produced quite an explosive flavor. Also tried the spicy wontons and Shang fried rice, and they were both delicious. The spicy wontons could have been spicier though, and the fried rice actually tastes a lot better than it looks.   They serve complimentary watermelon water which adds a nice touch to the overall dining experience. Very clean, modern place with attentive yet unobtrusive service. Will definitely be back for those Dan Dan noodles.",

Peking wonton soup - broth didn't taste that good to me. Peking zag-Jiang noodles - was ok.

For a starter we shared the Spicy Wonton appetizer. The homemade noodles definitely stood out on this dish. The wonton was delicate and the flavor was perfection. The spice level was perfect.   I had the Shang Beef Noodle Soup with knife-shaved noodles. My friend went with the Pork Belly Noodle Soup with hand-pulled noodles. The hand-pulled noodles resembled udon noodles while the knife-shaved noodles were thicker and wider. Both were delicious! My Beef Noodle Soup was a great dish. Everything in the soup tasted fresh and there were generous amounts of noodles and beef. The bok choy, cilantro, and green onion were delicious with the noodles and beef. There was enough to save for lunch the next day.   The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the decor is minimal. All seating options allow for watching the food being prepared. Seating options include tables and counter seating next to the kitchen. Pricing is more than reasonable for the quality and fresh nature of the food.   Our server was excellent. He was great with answering questions and took great care of us. As the night went on the restaurant filled quickly, but he kept up with everyone well. Most importantly, he made sure our delicious tea never ran out.  I'm already looking forward to my return to enjoy more of the delicious food!",

I have tried the Dan Dan Noodle which is more like pasta with meat sauce, the Spicy Wonton which is fresh and flavorful, yet the Beef Shang Noodle is actually the one that got my heart! Had it in a chilled fall evening and what an experience it was! The soup has a rich beef flavor and it carries just enough of spice to blend in perfectly with the hand-pulled noodle (highly recommend this kind of noodle over others since it's more chewy! ). Oh and I also tried the beef dumplings, didn't know they were panfried, so when the dish came out, we were shocked!! It looked super appealing with crunchy skin and fresh fillings. Anyway, really great experience there, the servers were attentive too! Keep up the good work!",

This was our first time here.    SERVICE:  Good, very nice, attentive, drinks and food came out in a timely manner.   FOOD:  We ordered the Spicy Wonton, Shang Beef Noodle soup with hand pulled noodles, and Pork Belly Noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.   Spicy Wonton - Nothing spectacular but not bad.  Wonton skin's and meat were cooked nicely, the sauce (tasted like a combination of Chinkiang vinegar/soy sauce/chili oil/topped with scallions) was a bit too tart and sweet for my liking but not bad.  I think a little bit more meat on the wonton's could improve this dish.   Shang Beef Noodles - Very good!  Good portion size.  The broth appears dark and rich but was definitely very subtle with good flavor.  The hand pulled noodles were cooked perfectly, nice and al dente.  Beef was very tender and delicious.  Recommended!  Pork Belly Noodles  - Good.  Just like the Shang Beef Noodles, portion size was good, broth also appeared dark and rich but was actually very light and subtle.  Broth had good flavor (reminiscence of a chinese pork/egg dish my mom made growing up).  Noodles were on point again.  Some pieces of pork belly were tough and some tender.  All and all, it was good but we'll probably try a different dish in the future.   The bill came out to be about $33 with tip, definitely not bad at all!  Look forward to coming back here again!!",

    "text": "Shang's commitment to quality ingredients, friendly service, and reasonable pricing will hopefully have more eyeballs looking their way soon.  I would go here over Noodle Man any day of the week.  One standout is their freshly made \"Spicy Wonton\" appetizer, which offers a comfortable heat that is accessible to most palettes.  I loved the silkiness of the wonton skin as my teeth broke into the delightfully, juicy pork center.  I also enjoyed the thick skinned \"Beef Pancake\" (eat these in small bites or the juice WILL shoot out the other side!) and the fantastic \"Beef & Onion potsticker\".  Those deep fried \"potstickers\" you've been eating elsewhere?  Total garbage!!!!  Their signature noodle soup, \"Shang Beef Noodle\", was sumptuous.  Not spicy or robust like the Taiwanese version, but the beefy flavor I sought was well pronounced.  That had everything to do with the braised beef brisket combined with all that delicious bone marrow broth.  And THEN there were all those hand pulled noodles underneath it all!!  Slurp after slurp, bite after bite...wonderful.     Other items:  Sliced Beef Shank: Served chilled and topped with balsamic vinegar sauce, this was another great starter.  I appreciated the tender and slightly gelatinous texture.  Shang Fried Rice: The preserved bean sprouts were the dominating flavor, which may not be a hit with fans of Americanized Chinese, so the Yang-Zhou version would probably be preferable.  I liked it, but it's not for everyone.  Cucumber Salad:  The combination of cool cucumber, tasty sesame sauce and the slight heat of chili oil on the bottom was a winning combination.    On my \"to eat\" list for future visits is..........the rest of the menu!!  Other tips:  - Do not let the noodles sit for long (ahem phone pics, cough,cough) as the texture will change and they are best as soon as served.    - The \"Hot\" items are not that spicy, just flavorful, so specify if you actually want HOT.",

So go early to avoid waiting outside the restaurant with temperatures over 100F. We will go back!",

    "text": "A meal with a show: Shang specializes in hand-pulled noodles, and the open kitchen allows you to watch this while you wait for your order.   My guy and I shared the spicy won ton appetizer and two noodle dishes for lunch- the Shang beef noodle soup with hand-cut noodles and the chicken and mushroom noodle with knife-cut. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the knife-cut noodle more, it reminded me of a thicker pappardelle. Both bowls were generous portions, and the soup broth was fairly good. I do wish the chicken and mushroom bowl had a few more mushrooms to balance out the amount of noodle received.   The concept, layout, and menu are very similar to Noodle Man but with a more convenient central location. Didn't notice any desserts, but they are right next door to Very Berry Cafe if you want to continue the Asian theme to complete your meal.",

    "text": "Another bookmark conquered off of my extremely long list of Yelp bookmarks. And it was an excellent decision deciding to come here too.  First impression is how clean the restaurant is. It could easily be a cafe serving just coffee or plated desserts. Not at all what I would stereotypically imagined a Chinese restaurant to look like from the abyss of my imagination.  That is a very good thing indeed.  The interior design is well conceptualized and executed, obviously the work done by a professional designer and contractor from scratch.  While we were looking over their simple menu, one of the chefs was making the handpulled noodles  from scratch (I didn't see the dough being made, just the very important part where the chef transformed a ball of dough into magical strands of noodles using nothing but his hands and physics, much practiced technique of Chinese noodle-making, without the aid of machines to roll out sheets of dough into the proper thickness and cut into the desired width).  He made it look way too easy!!!  At first I was going to order their hand cut noodle, but opted for the hand pulled noodles, since it was literally being made in front of our eyes, as we sat at the counter, right in front of their kitchen where noodles are hand made and the noodles are cooked and plated.  And I settled on ordering their Pork Belly HandNoodle , while my friend ordered their Dan-Dan Noodle .    It didn't take too long for our orders to be made. The Dan-Dan Noodle  came out first, followed shortly by my Pork Belly Handpulled Noodle.  The noodles are easily the main draw of coming here to eat. My Pork Belly Noodle was served with a very good broth, not oily or too salty, just a well made broth with 95% tender braised pork belly. (No preserved cabbage served here though, which is more of a Taiwanese style).    The Dan-Dan Noodle, according to my friend Jason, looks to be too salty (too much Dan-Dan Sauce) which he confirmed right away.  But he still liked the freshly made noodles.  The complimentary (due to checking in on Yelp) Wonton in Chili Oil  was not very impressive. The wontons on their own were above average, which are also made with handmade wonton wrappers. But their sauce was the underwhelming component that failed this dish.  In spite of the disappointing Dan-Dan Noodle and failed-to-impressed Wontons in Chili Oil, I still enjoyed the food enough to look forward to coming back again. However, next time I will give their Hand Cut Noodles  a go, I expect it to be every bit as good as their Handpulled Noodles.  4 stars.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today and I am not sure how I feel about this place. I love the Noodle Man so I was so excited to try out this place since it has a similar concept. The place is new so very clean and modern looking. They have a bunch of smaller tables, probably not the best place for large parties, especially if they get busy it will be difficult to pull tables together. The waitress was very sweet and made good recommendations.   For appetizers we ordred spicy wontons and beef and onions pot stickers, both came after we got our noodles (not much of an appetizer if it comes after the meal), but this wasn't a big deal to us. The spicy wonton looked really small but there were about 8 wontons in there, so pretty good portion; however, being called \"spicy\" wonton it was not spicy at all, there is a sweetness to the sauce that I did not expect, I would have liked for it to be spicer. The pot sticker came after we finished our noodles, the waitress said they were experimenting with a new pot and it messed up the pot stickers so they had to re-make it, they gave us a plate of the cucumber salad complimentary for the wait, which was very sweet of them. The skin on the pot sticker was too thick for my liking, the meat was kind of bland and dry, nothing special really. The sauce was really good though.   I got the pork belly with knife-shaved noodles. The broth as really good, very flavorful, but they gave me very little broth. The noodle was very thick and stuck together, it was hard to pick up each noodle, it stuck together like a big...glob. My sister got the Shang's noodle with hand pulled noodles, her broth was good but a bit warm, not as hot as she would have liked. She also said it was a little bland, she expected it to have chilli like at other places, but maybe it is just a different style.   Overall I think the place is decent, but I prefer the Noodle Man for the spicer wonton and broth. But they are pretty new so maybe just need a little time to adjust.",

Piping hot broth with braised beef brisket and veggies. It sounds simple but it really hits the spot on a cold day. I also loved their Spicy Wonton. For me, the sauce has some sweetness to it then the spice kicks your taste buds at the end. I can't quite explain it. The potsticker presentation is a must see, besides the taste. It's so pretty because it's shaped like a flower of some sort. The beef pancake is also tasty. Watch out though! Don't bite too fast or too hard, the soup inside will burn your tongue or hit your neighbor, both of which are not very pleasant.  The prices are awesome & the service is always friendly. I can't wait to go back!",

Both were excellent. We have been to China and I guarantee you this food is authentic.

We felt everything was perfect, Perhaps we were fortunate that the water was fresh in boiling the noodles because nothing was too salty, with the hand pulled noodles or the shaved noodles it was all ok. The service was great, if i was going to nit pick, I wish they had more brisket served with the noodles, very tender, and I have had better Pot Stickers here in the Bay Area otherwise I would have put up a 5 star rating, Can I give 4/[2 stars?

I suggest to just stick to the hand pulled one if u do take out. Because by the time we got back to the hotel (half hr later), the flat one turned into a clump of dough. I could imagine it woulda been more separated & actually looked like noodles if I had eaten it right then & there in a bowl. The hand pulled one stayed separated. Other than that, the flavors were great. I also ordered the beef pancakes, fried pork dumplings & fried beef dumplings. The beef dumplings & beef pancakes were pretty much the same. Just different shapes. I preferred the pancakes though cuz it's more fried due to the shape.   DECOR: 5/5 Clean & modern. Love that we can watch them make prep & cook right there. It's a little too hipster looking for me though.  SERVICE: 4/5 The girl taking the order walked around with her lil tablet. Wasn't like super friendly. She just seemed like a robot. The guy Latin guy with the green eyes making the pulling the noodle was nice about me taping him pulling the noodles. Please just be respectful & ask them if u can tape them. It's so rude when ppl just start video taping  or taking pictures without that person's consent.   Prices weren't too bad. I have to admit, when I first found this place on yelp, I wasn't sure I wanted to try it cuz the pictures & name of the restaurant looked & sounded way too hipster ish for me. I thought it was gonna be some fancy schmancy small portion dishes for an arm & a leg. But I decided to try it for the hand made noodles & I'm glad I did. The portions were bigger than I expected for the price they charge. They exceeded my expectations. The only thing that's hipster stuck up ish about this place was the robotic hostess/server. She wasn't rude or anything & answered my questions. She just needs to crack a smile & act a little more personal. This isn't some exclusive rich club or party. Reminded me of those ppl in movies working at some hip exclusive restaurants.",

I've seen this many times before but the chef here was very enthusiastic and you could tell he was enjoying what he was doing!

The beef pancakes were juicy and full of flavor, a perfect compliment to my noodles. Service here was also friendly and the waitress was attentive. Prices are also super reasonable.

We started with the beef pancake, spicy wonton, and Dan Dan Noodles. All great choices. The beef pancake takes a while but they are delicious. The spicy wontons are spicy, but soft and yummy. The Dan dan Noodles we order were with plain noodles. The flavor was good, but I expected a little better. I ordered the Shang beef with hand pulled noodle for my entree. It was savory and decadent. I definitely recommend it! My partner had the pork belly and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service is speedy, but attentive. With it being so packed and only having two servers, they move through the tables quickly. Note that your food is going to come out as it's ready so we ended up with our soups before some of our appetizers. It didn't bother us any. It was all tasty!",

Dan Dan hand pulled noodles: 2/5 again, noodles cooked well, but it was more bland than I expected. Also, I thought dan dan noodles had tahini in it, but these didn't, so I was pretty disappointed.  Hot oil wontons: 5/5 good flavor   Service was good, so they get 5/5 for that.   Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. It's an Uber ride from the strip and unless I was really in the mood for hot oil wontons, the other dishes didn't blow me away.",

    "text": "Recently Shang Artisan Noodle was recommended to me by a friend, so we decided to check it out. The reviews on Yelp are almost too good to be True. I mean... beef noodle soup? How can it be that good? At first I was a little hesitant to try because the pictures made it look just alright however boy I was wrong. We came here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was a bit crowded however we only waited for 5 minutes. It's a small place however reminds me of the ramen shops back home.   Menu consists of different types of dumplings, noodle soups, and more. First, they make their own noodles in house. If you order any of the noodle soups, you can choose how the noodles are cooked. There's three different ways: hand pulled, knife shaved, and normal. I have no idea what the difference was however the previous reviews suggest knife shaved. We decided to get the Shang beef noodle soup and spicy wontons. The spicy wontons come in 10 small pieces   We received our food quick! The pictures made the bowls look small however it was a regular sized bowl that ramen is served in. The broth.... the BROTH! I have never had anything like it. The beef makes the broth so rich and tasty. The noodles were similar to chow fun noodles however had very edged and not perfect cuts. It's was really delicious! I would recommend getting that cut. The spicy wontons were good as well. It's really spicy! There's a dipping sauce where you can add to help the heat but also add dimensional flavor.   Overall it was great to try something new! I just wished we had something like this back home. There's noodles are well made and tasty. The broth is delicious... what more can I say? Just try it out. Also we weren't expecting for our water to be cucumber lemon water. It caught us off guard but we appreciated it! Yum. Pricing is reasonable. All dishes are less than $10. They don't have a dessert menu but there's a lot of dessert places in the area. We're coming back the next time we're in town!",

I  havent had dan dan noodles much but I felt like they needed a little more sauce. The beef noodle soup, noodles and broth were perfect! I would go there again.",

I had the beef noodle soup and shared spicy wontons with my dad. 10/10 recommend! In my opinion, it tasted better than Din Tai Fung if anyone is familiar. We came around 2pm Sunday and waited about 15-20 mins. The food came out extremely fast and portions were fair. I will definitely come back the next time I visit Vegas.   My only kind of complaint here is that there was a large table of 6 just hanging out while someone was doing their homework at the table. Mind you, they were already finished eating. With 6 parties waiting to be seated, it was unprofessional that none of the workers stepped up to kindly tell them to leave. This may have been a one-off situation, but it is so important that everyone is mindful of the people waiting for a table. One large party waited more than an hour to be seated at a table and were aggravated as well.",

(9/10) The dough here is a little thicker than usual, and the pork flavor is a bit different than I've had in the last. But I mean this all in a good way. I would definitely order this again. Juicy, sweet and filling.   The spicy wontons were pretty good (7.5/10) and satisfied my craving for them, although I've had much better for way cheaper in OC/LA. Maybe it was lacking something in the sauce? Or maybe it was the filling inside the wontons that were a little dry. I can't exactly pinpoint it, but I know I wasn't wowed like I usually am with this dish.   Dandan noodles were also good (8/10). However I prefer when there is some peanut paste in the sauce, and this was purely Szechuan chili-based. I didn't mind it since I love spicy, but I guess it's just a personal preference for the peanut version of this sauce.   I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here again, given that there's so many other restaurants in Las Vegas and CA fills my Asian food needs. But I do recommend you check it out and try for yourself!",

My friend chose to eat at this noodle shop because she too shares the love/hate relationship with noodles. We came here in the morning time, but since the restaurant is bit small and we had a large party, there was a regular wait. We were seated at the bar and could easily watch the chefs put their soul into making noodles. They also had cute little tea chairs and table decorations around the counter.   I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and egg and tomato, both of which were amazing. My friends ordered various noodle dishes as well as sides such as the pork dumpling, the Shang Beef noodles, and the spicy wonton. Luckily with that, I was able to have a taste of *almost* everything.   The quality of food was to die for because the noodles were so fresh and soft and the spicy won ton was just as good as Din Tai Fung, if not better! I would definitely recommend going here for the experience and so you could develop an addiction to hand pulled noodles as well!",

Everything is cooked to order and it's so cool to see them shaving the dough into the boiling water as each order comes in. Hubby had the Dan Dan noodle and it was spicy!

The homemade noodles especially the flat noodles for those that love a little chewier texture is AMAZING!!!! Watching how they make the noodles leaves me in pure astonishment alone! You basically get a show while they make your meal. I went with the shanghai beef soup with the flat noodle it was delicious. The meat was tender and falling apart in my mouth, cooked to perfection. And you get big hunks of vegetables yum yum yum so crisp! The broth for me was the only thing I needed to doctor as I like mine spicier I added chili sauce and it was great just what it needed! Highly recommend the beef pancake and the hot n spicy wontons! One of my new favs!",

This restaurant is small with just a few tables and there are 10 seats at the bar where you can watch the cooks do their magic.  I ordered the beef stewed Noodle, chili oil wonton, Dan Dan Noodle. The beef stew was tender as I expected. The Dan Dan Noodle was just ok for me. The sauce for the spicy wonton is a bit too salty for my liking.  Also, the meat stuffing is not much for the wontons.  These young servers were very fast and one of them offered us water while we waited for our seats. You don't often find that kinda treatment. Anyhow, I'm rating this place 3 stars for food and service.",

    "text": "I know nothing about noodles. But on a recommendation I was told to go to Shang. It is on the west side Decatur and Flamingo. Located in one of the strip malls that used to have a great French cafe on the corner of the property. The inside of the restaurant is very simple but nicely decored. It probably has seating for thirty people. I ordered the spicy wontons as an appetizer $5.95. They were spicy hot but not too hard to manage but had a good flavor.      I  also ordered the pork belly Bowl. The stock was flavorful and the noodles were shaved.  The noodles were very tasty. The broth  had bok choy in it and the pork belly was okay. The pork belly was not fresh and had been precooked and some pieces were a little dry. A food prep thing I'm sure.  You are served a nice flavored water, I think it was cucumber water.       You definitely will be filled by the time you get to the end of your noodle bowl. It was not too salty nor lacking anything. I am not a pro on Noodle bowls but I would take a friend here for something different. The price is reasonable 8.95 for a big bowl.     The waiter was very cordial and was helpful in choosing the right noodle for my bowl.       You could see them pulling noodles in the prep kitchen.      You are given chopsticks and a personal size ladle for your bowl. The waiter said anyone who requested a soup spoon and fork are available for those who cannot manage chopsticks.     Nice job! Will come again as the weather gets colder in Las Vegas.  This will be a nice place to go for comfort food.",

I bit into a piece of what i thought was pork belly it was a huge chunk of ginger unpeeled.   The \"spicy\" wonton had no spice at all.  After we told the server that our beef was frozen she brought out a complementary dish cucumbers with sesame sauce on it. But....the sauce on the cucumbers was not edible either the taste was unflavored sesame wallpaper paste.   We were hoping this place would be as good or better than noodle man but it was not and unfortunately will never be returning.",

I added in some chili paste they provide on the table to kick it up -- be careful, because it's legit chili and hot. I had not previously experienced Chinese noodle soup like this, it reminded me of Vietnamese Pho, and you eat it the same way: with a large spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other.   The service was excellent -- efficient and friendly, but not overbearing. The restaurant is spanking clean, and you can also watch the food being prepared in the open kitchen.   My only suggestion would be to lower the sodium in the broth. It's pretty salty, but I will admit that I am not a huge fan of sodium. But I can't wait to return and try other items.",

The beef noodle soup here was flavorful! I liked this and the beef pancake was good but had to take it back as it came way at the end. By then, I was full to even try it. One thing I thought and didn't really find appealing was the sesame cucumber. It was descent but I didn't expect like a paste over cucumber. Overall, a very good pick to start our Vegas week getaway. It's affordable and the flavors are good! Always a treat now to go exploring outside of the strip to eat some good affordable Asian food!",

We got there at 11 am right when they opened, and were seated right away. It became completely full with a wait by 11:45, so definitely get here early unless you're willing to wait. Trust me, it's worth it!   I ordered the Beef Shank noodle and my boyfriend ordered the Shang beef noodle. The dish names are similar, but such different flavors! The Shang beef noodle is definitely heartier, but the broth is not too heavy. The soup has a sweetness to it, also with large chunks of beef. The beef shank noodle on the other hand was a glorious cure to the Vegas hang over. Light, silky cradle broth with thin slices of beef. It's great with the chili oil if you want some spice.   The knife cut noodles are my absolute favorite since I always want the noodles al dente. Right now, they're serving the green jade noodles for a limited lime made with spinach (makes the dish Instagram worthy too! I have no complaints with each dish being $10.

This was pretty awesome since we were able to see the chefs making the noodles right in front of us. The service here was decent, everyone was nice but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was amazing. We ordered the spicy wontons and Shang's beef noodle with hand pulled noodles.  The spicy wontons were just meh for me, their sauce was a bit spicier than what I've had before and had this odd sourness to them. I wouldn't get them again honestly. The beef noodle was awesome though! The hand pulled noodles were ok but I really liked the broth and the tenderness of the brisket was superb. Only thing was I would've liked a bit more brisket.",

I had the Dan Dan Noodles and they were spicy, just as I liked. The spicy wontons were a great appetizer as well, very flavorful. Overall the fried rice was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. I will be returning here next time I'm in Vegas!",

We decided to check out the place because it's less than a mile from our hotel.  We signed in and the wait was 1.5 hours close to 2.  Even though the line was long, it was well worth it.  We chose the hand-pulled noodles and you can definitely tell the quality is way better than machine-made noodles.  Prices were decent.  This place is definitely recommended to try.",

We were starting to get a little concern, we went thru some iffy neighborhoods before we there (thank you, apple maps, the fastest route is not the best).  Situated in a new strip mall, the shop is packed with people waiting outside.  It took about 25 mins for us to get seated and the tasty adventure begin.  We had order the spicy wanton, the beef pancakes and the pot stickers for appetizers, those came fairly quick and were so delicious.  Not a huge amount of spicy on the wantons, but full of flavor.  The beef pancakes and pot stickers were great, filled with juice.   Noodles were good too, I had the Dan-dan noodles, which was excellent.  Noodles were chewy, and soft at the same time with just enough texture.  The soup (my wife had it) was awesome, I kicked myself for not ordering it, cause that was awesome too.",

    "text": "Two days ago, I saw pictures on Instagram from two of my favorite Elite Yelpers and food bloggers, Emily R and Stefany V.  The pictures featured these absolutely stunning green noodles...and if you know me, you know that I LOVE noodles of any kind.    Checking out both pages, I discovered that Shang Artisian Noodles was celebrating their 2nd anniversary, and offering a pretty sweet dine in deal:  ALL noodle dishes 50% off...and 2 days only, hand pulled jade spinach noodles.    We arrived and took the only available seat left in the place, it was packed with people!  Shang is a small restaurant, but it is bright, clean, and features an open kitchen where you can watch the noodles being pulled, and watch the awesome process of knife cutting the noodles.    Service was polite and super prompt.  We ordered:  Seafood noodle soup with the jade spinach noodles Beef shank noodle soup with jade spinach noodles Beef and Onion pot stickers:  these we were told take about 15 minutes, which was fine.  The soup arrived first.   The seafood soup was light, with perfectly cooked shrimp and squid.  (This also comes with a fish cake, but we opted to not have that, my husband isn't a fan of fish cake.) The noodles were perfect:  They stood up to the broth and didn't get soggy at all, they maintained a perfect texture and bite.    The beef shank soup was bloody delicious.  The broth was a little more rich than the seafood broth, likely due to the beef shank.  The beef was amazingly tender.  Again, the jade spinach noodles were just perfect.  Love these.  I'm honestly a little sad that they are only available for a limited time.  The pot stickers arrived, and they looked REALLY neat.  They are pan fried and came out with this...crusty top...it looked like a giant mushroom.  The crispy crust was so yummy, and the pot stickers were hot, juicy, and really flavorful.  We really enjoyed these.  After devouring his seafood soup, my husband opted to try another bowl of soup...at 50%, wouldn't you?    He ordered the Shang Noodle soup, which was a brisket soup, this time he opted for the knife cut noodles.   This was the winner of the evening.    The brisket has a tiny bit of fat on it, which most people don't mind...I tend to have an issue with the texture, but the piece I tried was perfection.  The knife cut noodles were spectacular:  I honestly wouldn't order any other noodle with this dish.  I'd order this just for the broth.  It was SO good.   This was a spectacular visit.  Its not horribly far from us, so I anticipate that we will be going back again, and soon.    Thanks to the staff at Shang, we really appreciated the personable service, and the delicious food!",

    "text": "This noodle joint is new to the neighborhood. It's located a few miles away from the strip, even further than Palms. It's intimate -- a dozen seats at the bar and about six tables. No outdoor seating.   Even though it's 100 degrees outside, we came by for some hot noodz. There was no wait when we arrived, but the place filled up shortly after. Service was efficient. Friendly, attentive. They play Top 20 music -- not the censored version, though, and they have plenty of children who dine in.   Here's what we got:  Shang Beef Soup with Hand-Pulled Noodles - $9.75. Fair prices.  - Beef broth, braised beef brisket, bok choy and scallions.  - Flavorful and a hint of spicy.  - Great portion, good amount of noodles.  - Noodles are slightly undercooked, so expect a bit of crunch.   Beef Pancakes - Four pieces for $5.99.  - Super juicy! Be careful when cutting them.  - Pretty delish. Highly recommend.  - Great appetizer for two to share.   Ample parking, as Shang is located in a plaza. Easy to find.   Not bad for a lunch option, but it's quite far for tourists. I would come back at some point in the future, no rush.",

Got here at like 10:30 but they don't open until 11 am  so I had to kill some time.  When they opened, they had a line already.  The place was almost filled up at 11:30.    There was an awesome gentleman pulling some noodles and putting on a show.  Pretty cool to watch.  Very clean and modern place.  Ordered the spicy wonton and it was delicious.  Meaty and flavorful filling while the wrapping was thin and delicate.  Also ordered the pork and cabbage dumplings.  This was my least favorite dish.  The wrapping was too thick.  I ordered the dan-dan hand pulled noodles.  Flavorful, kinda spicy but the noodles were excellent.  Chewy and soaked up the flavors of the minced pork.  My girlfriend ordered the Shang beef hand pulled noodles.  Broth was deep with beefy flavor and the meat was tender.  Overall, an awesome place to grab some noodles in a nice modern clean restaurant.  Hopefully someone is making some noodles since that's a nice little show.",

I got the beef noodles and omg it tasted so good. The soup is very rich and hearty, perfect for a colder day.  The noodles pick up the flavors of the broth too. The \"dumplings\" were probably overkill. I got so full from them and the meat inside was moist and super juicy. The outside of them is very crisp and it pairs well with any noodle.   One issue is that this place is kind of small, so you will wait a bit before you are seated if you have a larger group. I had to wait about 30 min for a group of 5 during lunch time.",

    "text": "2/8/18  So the soon-to-be family is here, straight from China.  My gf's sister is more accustomed to traveling, even having spent a year or two in England getting a degree, but the rest of them........ no, as FOB as FOB can be.  And other than for our wedding, her parents pretty much have only left China for this once, and probably never will again...  So what has that got to do with this restaurant?  Well, imagine grabbing some of the most stereotypical Americans and throwing them on a plane to your favorite exotic country--you'll immediately encounter a problem... they won't eat nothing!  Hell, if it's a country where McDonald's doesn't exit, they might very well get close to starving to death.  Yup, so we just finished up Vegas and it was time to head home... and OMFG I could not believe this place existed!!!--and even just a couple miles from the strip!...  1. Shang Beef Noodle $9.75 \"beef broth, braised beef brisket, veggies\":  Look, the beef noodle soup here is so authentic, so good, that it's NOT authentic!!!  Cause in China, they don't actually make broth this intense, to the point that it's even a bit cloudy.  It's almost like a tonkatsu broth, but Chinese-style made from beef.  The noodles are of course great (spun and pulled right in front of you be the very non-Chinese noodle master--I believe he told me that the owner learned from China and taught him.)  Maybe the noodles aren't the most \"q q\" I've ever had, but they're damn good anyway.  Too bad the bok choy was a bit raw, but I didn't mind given how great everything else was... among the very best, in America, or even in China / Taiwan!  10/10  So, if you got Chinese or Taiwanese relatives over that are picky eaters (like 95% of Americans and the world), and need to eat in Las Vegas, THIS IS THE PLACE.  They'll be happy.  You'll be happy.  Shang Artisan, thank you for saving my family's lives.  5/5  #lasvegas #chinesenoodles #chineseramen #chinese #vegas",

I always go for the beef shank noodles; the bok choy is crunchy, the beef shanks are always tender and juicy. The soup is never heavy. I also usually get the hand pulled noodles because I enjoy this texture more than any other noodle choice. My boyfriend usually gets the knife cut noodles, which are bigger in width. We also usually get the spicy wontons, which compliment the soup very well while you're drinking your soup and eating your noodles. Delicious and always worth the wait!",

    "text": "This is probably my most favorite find in Vegas thus far. I was looking for a noodle place and this place popped up. Shang is a little restaurant that specializes in hand-pulled noodles.   [1] Beef noodles - It seems that most of the patrons in the restaurant at the time ordered the beef noodle soup. My roommate got this and she really enjoyed it. It's served with bok choy, green onions, and cilantro. The broth is delicious and the beef is extremely tender.   [2] Dan Dan Noodles which is a dry noodle served with minced pork, sichuan pepper, chili oil and scallions. I'm always craving cold udon which can sometimes be similar to dan dan noodles, so I opted to go against the crowd and get this dish. I really enjoyed the hand pulled noodles, the minced pork was perfectly savory, and the chili oil pulls everything together perfectly.   [3] Spicy Wonton - Delicately wrapped wontons served with chili oil, green onions, and sesame seeds. Really really good dish, I would order this again for sure.   [4] Beef Pancakes - another favorite dish of mine, I always order it whenever I get the chance. The presentation of the beef pancake at Shang was unconventional, they're more like little cylindrical fried dumplings. Really good, also another must order.   The bill was surprisingly cheap for the amount of food we got! There was only one server that night and she was holding it down!! I can't wait to tell my friends and family all about this place.",

Overall, I was just really impressed with this restaurant. I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup with hand-pulled noodles, which was just phenomenal. I want to try the knife-cut noodles next time. You actually get to see the staff create the noodles from scratch too, which was entertaining and super IG-able good (hint: use the boomerang setting). The beef was tender with a good combination of fat. The soup was simply delightful.  Price-wise, it was extremely affordable and I left satisfied. You definitely get your money's worth. We also got beef pancakes, which were good;however, I'd probably skip this appetizer next time.",

Noodles were really good, the shang broth was good and meat tender. Pork belly really does not belong in soup is what we  found out. I would skip this dish.

My boyfriend ordered the pork belly noodle soup and my friend ordered the yang zhou fried rice. We also shared beef pancakes (it's like a baked version of Xiao long bao). My friends and I were very satisfied with the service and the food. Highly recommended to try! Will come back soon! 50% or not, one of the best noodle soups I've ever had!",

    "text": "Shang is a little restaurant that specializes in hand-pulled noodles. While we were in Vegas a month ago, the trusted Yelp app pointed us down the road from our hotel. It was nightime, it was cold, it was time for noodles!   When we arrived on a weekday night, there were only 2 tables occupied. Our server greeted us quickly, broughtus menus and checked back in minutes to take our order.   We had:   Peking wontons with knife cut noodles. The noodles were chewy, great texture in a nice light broth, but the wontons were the smallest I've ever seen. They were mostly wonton skin with very little filling, maybe the size of a dime.   Shang beef noodle soup w/ hanf pulled noodles. Great flavor with tender pieces of beef. Some had chunks of fat, some were leaner. Broth was good but noodles were lacking. It's about 1/2 of theportion of what I normally get with an order. The menu listed an extra order of noodles for $1.5. Being from SoCal surrounded by Chinese noodle joints, at first I wondered why it was even offered, but quickly realized I needed it.   The service was very pleasant and fast. The place is clean, well lit and has an open kitchen where customers who sit at the counter can witness the chef working the hand made noodles. We enjoyed our 2 orders and it hit the spot in satisfying the need for something warm and soupy, but couldn't help comparing it to the dozens of places in the San Gabriel Valley that also serve up really tasty noodles at a bigger portion and better prices.   Yes, I do recommend a visit here. Great texture of noodles, great service and great flavor. Even though I'm surrounded by places that will give Shang Artisan Noodles a run for its money, I'm not ruling them out just yet. After all, there are plenty of other items to try on the menu.",

    "text": "After my first plan for dinner bafflingly failed, I found another nearby noodle restaurant that delivered. Well, figuratively anyway. Unless you go for Uber Eats, which is fine if you don't want freshly cooked noodles, and that would probably be a big mistake. Am I rambling? Whoops.  Anyway, I found my way to the plaza on Flamingo near Decatur containing Shang Artisan Noodle as my plan B for early Sunday night dinner. It was easy to find because it's next to Yonaka, a place that's quite familiar to me. I walked inside and was glad to see that only a couple other parties of patrons were there.  I chose bar seating when the server asked me my preference. I took my time to look at the menu as well as friends' reviews. Sadly, they were out of the consensus favorite knife-shaved noodles and only had hand-pulled noodles and plain noodles available.  Of course I had to settle on the hand-pulled noodles at that point. My Shang Beef Noodle Soup ($8.95) came out after a few short minutes. The noodles indeed were al dente and tasted fresh, but they weren't utterly captivating. The broth wasn't complex, but it was  properly seasoned and hence quite slurpable (albeit with a shallower than expected wooden spoon). The beef was just tender enough and was fairly tasty. The bok choy was cooked nicely, and it brought a juicy crunch and a slight bitterness. It's not my favorite bowl of beef noodle soup around, but it's pretty solid overall.  My \"appetizer\" came out later, having taken roughly 10 minutes to cook as I'd been forewarned. The Beef Pancakes ($5.49) are not what Americans would call a pancake, but instead a stuffed savory dumpling or bun. They're pretty doughy and have a flavorful, juicy ground beef filling that gushes out liquid when you cut into it with the serrated knife. I completely forgot about the dipping sauce during and after my first bite, and that sauce does help lend sweetness but isn't strictly necessary. I didn't bother to try out the tableside condiments of soy sauce or chili oil on either of my orders because they didn't seem necessary.  Luckily, I got to catch a show toward the end of my meal when the chef made another batch of hand-pulled noodles. It's pretty fun to see the strands gradually take shape and thin out as the chef twists and rolls the dough. This is definitely the best part of sitting at the bar, or at least with your seat facing the kitchen.  I'll definitely come back to Shang Artisan Noodle so I can sink my teeth into the knife-shaved noodles. Even without having tried those noodles, I'd recommend this restaurant as a good solo or small group dining option for fresh Chinese noodles and those juicy, beefy morsels on the appetizer menu.",

No big deal here, I was looking forward to finding out what this place is all about.   As we were seated, our server delivered fresh cucumber water, the flavored water was a nice surprise. The smells are enticing for sure. The dining room lively. The decor modern. So far, so good.  Ordered: Cucumber Salad that comes with a pureed dressing- extra chili oil over top- the dressing of peanuts, chili oil, nutty sesame oil and seed, and ginger for the zing. This was satisfying, light and refreshing - a good plate to share among friends.  Beef noodle w/ Knife cut noodle - arrives piping hot and topped with fresh herbs (green onion & cilantro), the smells were so good wish there was \"smell-o-vision\" to share with you as the soup steamed through the herbaciousness.  My first thought after first bite? Nice tooth to the noodle! Glad we went the knife cut, on suggestion of my fellow Yelpers - good call and thanks ya'll! The texture of the meat had too much fattiness running thru to really sort through without getting fat in each bite, so that freaked out the bf and wasn't my favorite truth be told... anyone sensitive to textures, I'd say try the pork rib or one of the other soups. That said, THE FLAVOR of the meaty beef broth had that roasted-bone sweet richness- personally, I recommend this one for that deep beefy-onion flavor.  Pork rib noodle knife cut - First thought upon first bite? Oh My. In a good way. Meat had a good texture, on the bone adding all the delicious meat-on-boneness. Then there was the sweet, onion, and slightly acidicly-light and almost lemony broth that I found delightful to the last drop. Lighter than the beef, but still rich in pork broth flavor and again freshness from green onion/cilantro. The noodles were once again cooked perfectly, not soft, not too hard - just right. And I really enjoyed eating the pork down to the bone.   Solid 4.5. Will return to adventure through some other dishes, I am confident they won't disappoint.",

    "text": "Could have been better. Although, it was decently price especially in Vegas. There were a lot of underwhelming features to Shang as I grew up in LA with a lot of noodles shops.  Let's just start off with saying that the fresh noodles were actually great. We ordered 2 appetizers and 3 noodles. I would say that their pot stickers might be the worst I've ever had or close to it. The reason to it(although the picture looks AMAZING) is that there was no seasoning and for some reason, it was like the chef accidentally got the sugar instead of the salt. It was REALLY ODD as you bite into it, you get a very bland taste that ends with a sweetness to it. I understand that there are a lot of dishes that adds sugar to food but this was just odd. I would say that was prob the worst part of it all.  The meat bun was okay. I had one better but it wasn't too shabby.  SO the 3 noodles, they all had their flaws and they all had their pros. Starting with the beef noodles, the beef was actually super good and the soup was super flavorful that I kept going back but what the problem was, was that the noodles didn't soak in the flavor of the soup. So it was like you're eating 3 things seperately. Noodles, soup, and beef. It's not say the beef noodles were bad or perhaps maybe I had to get the thick noodles for it to soak in the flavor of the soup but thatwas the issue.   The  dan dan noodles was topped off with a lot of the meats which is not the problem. It's also quite different from the usual dan dan noodles. DO I prefer the original style over this one? Maybe just a little bit. The problem was actually the fact that they brought us this luke warm. I'm pretty sure I know the reason to it too. I'm sure all the meat toppings were made already so the freshly made noodles was cooked hot topped off with the cold meat toppings making it luke warm which is just terrible. So I would prob enjoy this dish so much more if it was hot...or if you had tell me it was cold noodles but it was warm...  The chicken chow mein. I actually like this dish the most. It was really flavorful and I said that I loved the noodles despite my complains. The real issue was the horrible chicken. It just tasted bad and frozen(but mainly bad). You know it never really happens where you don't eat the proteins but this was the case because it was just awful. The chow mein with the veggies were sooooo good but that chicken really made this dish worse than it is. I was thinking about how much I would love the beef from the beef noodles with this chow mein even though it's a weird mix up but regardless it's a 3 star.   The service was better than you usual ones because there's a lot of American speakers which is good in a lot of way. So there's that.",

Standing room only for waiting with a constant flow of singles to groups of six. You know you'll have great reviews of your meal with a wait like this. $6 Lyft from Park MGM as this off the strip and nothing else around so you're driving out just for the food. You'll be entertained watching the hand pulled noodles being made or the shaven noodles into the boiling water. Pan Fried Pork Dumplings came out HOT and crispy, Beef Noodle Soup with the hand pulled noodles are richly seasoned well. You have a choice of hand pulled noodles, shaven noodles or noodles to the sauces dishes or soup choices. Price point is one third less than any of the casino noodle shops on the strip.

I had the chow mein with the hand pulled noodles and it was delicious. My mom had the hand pulled noodle soup, and she loved it as well. Shang's is perfect for some slightly more upscale comfort noodles, at a very reasonable price. We went on a Saturday night and unsurprisingly it was packed, but service was very efficient and we didn't have to wait.   If you're craving delicious hand pulled noodles and have access to a car, or don't mind splurging on an Uber, then you must try Shang's!",

    "text": "Heard this was the noodle spot to visit, so rounded up a group and went for dinner. The store is in a newish nondescript strip mall near Flamingo and Decatur. The store inside is quite stylish and beautiful, though.   You queue at the front of the store after signing in at the lectern. We only waited a few minutes before being seated at a table for 4. The menu is quite simple and I opted for the beef brisket noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. There are 3 varieties of noodles that you can choose from.   For entertainment you can see into the glass walled kitchen and watch the cooks stretch noodles and do the cooking. Back to the soup - it was one of the best that I've tasted here in Vegas. Very flavorful and the brisket was top notch.   We also ordered the beef dumplings which are an accident waiting to happen. They were served directly from the skillet - and the waitress warned us to be careful as they were super hot. Bad idea to just bite into one as they are full of hot steaming liquid that is likely to burn your mouth. So punch a hole in the side and let the steam out if you aren't familiar with drinking boiling water. They did taste great though.   Awesome place and I will be back with other friends in the near future.",

The baby bok choy was good and just the right soft and crispness. The spicy wontons are spicy, but good. The reason for four stars is because everything is pretty salty.

There was a convenient restaurant located downstairs of our hotel and just the thought of paying $18 for beef noodle soup and $12 for two pieces of dim sum was hard to digest. So we ventured off the strip and found this new and highly rated spot!   Solid 5 stars for organized and renovated interior, friendly service, cheap and affordable prices, and the most delicious beef noodle soup and spicy wontons! I'd always knew Chinese food on the west coast was much more superior compared to the DMV. But my goodness, their hand pulled noodles were so soft with the perfect texture. Our food arrived quickly because you can see them prepare each dish fresh as ordered. The beef to the Shang's beef noodle soup was so tender and the fatty parts just melted in my mouth. I'm afraid to say I prefer their beef over my dad's! The soup was flavorful and an addition of bok choy and extra noodles was only $1 each! That's quality and quantity!   The skin to the spicy wonton appetizer was silky and soft and the spicy sauce was different than anything I've had with this particular dish. It was spicy but not overpowering and very flavorful too.   We also ordered the pork and cabbage potstickers and the filling with flavorful with the unique addition of soup inside! So be careful as you bite into it or else the soup will shoot out the other end! You have to eat it dandy with little bites at a time. I got into it after the first piece and watching my hubby take big bites and losing all that good broth.   Oh how I wish there was such an affordable and quality place back home at the DMV. I'm sad that I discovered this place on my last day in Vegas or else I would have been coming here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",

Will definitely make my way back here any time I visit Vegas again.  Shang Beef Noodle - 5/5. No real complaint here at all. The meat was the most tender I've had at one of these types of places (which, granted, is a low bar cause it's usually overcooked). Noodles were springy and cut well just like good hand pulled noodles should be, veggies were just the right amount of cooked, and the soup had a deep meaty flavor without being oversalted, which is indicative of them not taking shortcuts with making the soup like other places. I was actually able to drink the entire bowl and not have a sore throat after.   Cucumber Salad - 4/5. The presentation was nice, and once you mixed the peanut sauce with the cucumber, the dish had a nice light flavor.  Spicy Wonton - 4/5. I haven't seen this in the states that often, but this was well done. The sauce hit the right sweet/sour/spicy spots without being too overbearing. My one complaint is that the amount of filling was low compared to the wrapper, so the ratio felt off when you bit into it: would have liked to see it stuffed a bit more.",

    "text": "When in vegas, it's always best to eat off the strip! Loved that their noodles are made in house and are fresh. Tried the beef noodle soup, chicken chow mein, spicy wontons and beef pancake.  Beef noodle soup was good, but felt a little plain compared to the ones in the 626 of los angeles. Still very good though.   The chicken chow mein and beef pancakes were delicious. Got knife cut noodles with the chow mein, which were a game changer since small noodles are typically served for that dish. Spicy wontons were ok. Not as amazing as the ones from din tai fung, but good none the less.  Overall, I will be back next time I'm in Vegas! #sendnoodz",

    "text": "So we went here on a Monday afternoon close around dinner time and it wasn't that busy. We were seated approximately 5minutes after we came in. But I think we were just lucky because as soon as we were seated, a bunch of other parties started lining up! Talk about perfect timing!  We ordered the Shang Beef, Dandan, and Seafood Noodles and a side order of the Beef Pancake. The pancake took a little too long to arrive, though. We were already more than halfway through our noodles when they served it. But it's okay.  So on to the good stuff. First, the servers are very nice, attentive, and polite. It just made the whole dining experience a lot better for a casual restaurant. Second, the food is actually pretty good. The Dandan is the clear winner for me. It's spicy and the flavors are right. A bite took me back to years ago when I was living in Singapore. That's how authentic the taste is. This doesn't, however, mean that the other two noodles aren't any good. Because they are. The Shang Beef Noodles are seasoned right and the Beef pieces are served in generous portions and are light and soft. The broth in the Seafood Noodles is also really good.  Now for the not so good bits. I mentioned earlier that the Beef Pancake took extra long to be served. And they really tell you that when you order that it takes 10 minutes. But that's not really the case. Anyway, I don't mind the wait. It's just that the noodles are a bit too heavy to eat that by the time the Beef Pancake were served, we were only able to eat one. And that's just to taste it and not enjoy it. If we could have been told that it really takes almost 20minutes to prepare, then we would have asked to just get that to us first before the Noodle Dishes. Anyway, the Beef Pancake is okay. Nothing special except for the juicy soup that goes out of it. Similar to a Xiao Long Bao.   Overall, the experience was great and we will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Theres nothing better than Shang Artisan Noodle. It epitomizes the best of East Asian cuisine in Las Vegas. A small space with a pleasant wooden interior, Shang offers an environment that reminds me of being in Japan or Taiwan, and even allows you to watch the fresh dough being made into their awesome noodles. My favorite is the knife cut (I love thicker), but they're all great! Also do not skip the side dishes! If you're going with one, or its your first visit, you must try the beef pancake. Its flavorful, juicy, and the dough perfect. The pot stickers are also awesome (as are the dumpling, I just love a great, classic pot sticker) and I get the cucumber salad every time. I recommend the chicken sesame or dan-dan, but for those adventurous (or the vegetarian) I was impressed and would easily order the tomato and egg consistently too.",

The beef needed to be simmered longer as the tendon portions were still tough. The only thing good was the broth. Flavorful without being overly salty or full of msg. The beef shank appetizer was very tough. I would not recommend it.",

We tried the beef noodle soup, pork belly noodle soup, and Peking wonton soup with noodles - potstickers and beef pancake completed the meal. Everything was delicious - my son said it's the best he's had second only to Grandma's, which is probably the best compliment he could have given.

We order: Cucumber salad $4.95 ( not a fan the sesame seed sauce over powder everything)  Pork and cabbage pot stickers $5.49 ( so worth it! Takes 15 minutes to make after ordering. Hot juicy and not dry! )  Shang beef noodle with the knife cut noodle $8.95 ( did think it made much flavor was my least fav)  Pork belly noodle with knife cut noddle $8.95 ( so good! Pork could have been more tender, but the broth was good and the knife cut soaked the flavors from the broth compared to the hand pull noddles)  Dan-dan noodle with hand pulled noodle ( may fav out of all the middle dishes)   Very reasonably price for everything total was around $50",

The Dan Dan is to die for and the service is always great. It is a small restaurant, but the wait is never too long. The menu does not have too many choices, and that proves the quality of each dish. I have been to this restaurant 8 times in the past year, and for a town like Las Vegas where there are millions of places to eat, any place that has you going back is worth its weight in noodles.",

I alway think \"I wish we could have that here!\" Well hah!  Now that I live driving distance from Vegas, I can! I'm a big fan of noodles, and had been hoping to try hand pulled noodles for years. Shang is everything I'd hoped for.  The big plus is being seated around the kitchen area where you can watch as lumps of dough are transformed into noodles. This is an art that took a very long time to develop and takes years to master.  The result is a noodle texture like nothing else.",

We sat at the bar, and was able to watch as they made all the food. Quite a nice experience!!   The ordering is all done on iPad for the servers, modern layout.  It's not very big, so get there early so you don't have to wait too long.  Luckily when we got there, there was enough seats at the bar. When we left. There was a line up at the door already.   I had braised pork ribs noodles. The braised pork ribs was pretty good, but one of my family members gave me a braised beef, and that was so good! Definitely go for their signature bowl!   We got some dumplings, and also pan fried bun (sorry I don't remember the name on the menu anymore), but it was so so so juicy!!! Be careful when you bite, the juices squirt out and might be hot! We watched as the master made it in front of us. It wasn't frozen or anything!   Awesome place for some fresh made ramen and juicy dumplings!",

    "text": "REALLY good. And talk about that eye candy!  My friends and I came here on a Sunday at 3pm and there were only a couple of tables left, but they had obviously just been through a huge lunch rush as most of the tables still had to be cleaned. At first we asked for a table but thought better of it and decided to sit at the bar. Do this. Sit at the bar. It is totally worth it and the experience of watching the noodle transformation, the dumpling making, and just food preparation is probably a totally different experience than sitting with your companions at a table.  The restaurant is small -- no more than twenty tables and a wrap-around bar with about 20 seats. The staff here is super friendly and very, very helpful. They make no assumptions about how much you know about the menu and are incredibly enthusiastic to offer suggestions. For appetizers, we ordered the following: Spicy Wonton - house-made wonton with spicy soy sauce and Beef Pancakes. Totally agree with the other reviewers - the sauce for the spicy wontons is a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise they are very good. Don't expect huge lumpsof meat wrapped in a tiny wonton though, because they are cute, tiny wontons. I really loved the beef pancakes and thought they were a unique cross between a soup dumpling and gyoza. Delish!  For my main, of course I had to order soup! I tried the Shang Beef Noodle: beef broth, braised beef brisket, veggies + hand-pulled noodles. The  soup is HUGE. It is incredibly flavorful and the beef is tender and seasoned well. Everything in that bowl is delicious, made even more delicious by the hot young man constantly pulling noodles in front of us. I'm telling you, sit at the bar. Oh, and you get lots of noodles in the soup. Don't order extra noodles, that's just crazy.  Worth traveling off the strip? If only just to see the noodle maker...",

Perhaps to help turn tables much quicker, investing in a busser would help with the wait. Customers were waiting for their checks, waiting to pay, and then waiting to sign/payment change. 2 waiters did everything, which caused some wait but hats off to their nonstop hustle!!Outside of that, the food is really good! Fresh, bouncy hand pulled noodles. These fresh noodles make a world of difference and I'm thankful for them! I've had the Shang beef noodles, Dan Dan noodles, cucumber salad, beef pancakes, sliced beef shank, pork & cabbage pot stickers, and beef and onion boiled dumpling. All very, very tasty. But if there's one appetizer that's a must, it's the beef pancakes. If you've had XLB's, then you'll love this change in texture. Be sure to prepare your chili oil and vinegar dipping sauce too! Note that the sliced beef shank appetizer is cold. It's kind of like eating left over meat straight from the fridge. I just ended up adding it to my bowl of soup. Clean establishment and restrooms as well. I hope one opens in SoCal.",

    "text": "Okay so we might be giving this place too much credit but the only reason why we gave it 4 stars because the ingredients were FRESH, most importantly the noodles. It was so fresh that I feel like the noodle was too bland. Kind of like \"doughy\". The noodle did not absorb the flavor in the dish as much I thought it would which was disappointing.   So we ordered the Dan Dan noodle which was minced pork with green onion and spicy soy sauce. That itself was on point. Super delicious especially if u add more green onion and the chili paste provided at the table. (If u like spicy) We also ordered the Shang fried rice which the waiter recommended as most popular and most definitely, that dish was super good. The taste was super favorable that we finished the whole plate! Lol we also ordered one of the appetizers, which was the beef and onion boiled dumplings. It was okay. The dough by far was fresh but a little too hard than expected than the usual soft dumpling you're used to.   With that said, the place was clean. Service was fast and friendly. Small but accommodating with the typical noodle bar which we sat because we enjoy watching the cooks cook and noodle dough being made.  What was also awesome was that you could choose 3 types of noodle for your dish which I haven't experienced at any other noodle place like this! You can choose between hand pulled, knife shaved and another option I can't think of. I recommend the knife shaved one even though I didn't try it myself! Lol it looked really good on everyone else's orders. We unfortunately picked the hand pulled noodle which I feel might've been too thick which is why the flavor did not absorb well. Overall, nice experience but not nice enough to crave or go back to...",

Since Noodle man and Ramen Kobo were both disappointments   Clean and modern decor, well lit, very comfortable ambience  The cold cucumber appetizer was tasteless to us, two other friends joined us later and agreed, we didn't finish  Chili wonton looked promising!!!! All 4 of us again was disappointed with the blandness.   3 of us ordered their house beef noodle soup and I ordered the Dan Dan noodle. My Dan Dan noodle was super salty and my husband did not care much for the beef noodle soup.  However our 2 friends enjoyed their beef noodle soup very much. I would suggest to come and at least try it for yourself since 2/4 of us really liked it.  Great news is, noodles did looked and tasted hand pulled and the staff was very nice and friendly!",

Even though this is technically off the strip, it's definitely worth the short drive; one, because of the reasonable price point, and two (and most importantly), the food is really good! The night before I visited this place, my dad and I had some pretty bland noodles and dumplings at some resto in Ceasar's Palace, and not only did it not hit the spot, but we paid an absurd amount for what we got. Our dining experience here was a different story. Everything was super tasty and the noodles were a really good texture/consistency - perfectly al dente. My party had the spicy wontons, beef pancakes, beef shank noodles and shang beef noodles, all of which were really good! The next time I'm in Vegas and in the mood for soupy noodles, I know where I'm going!",

    "text": "\"Shanging out\" at Shang Artisan Noodle should become a new verb trend, defined by relaxing with friends or significant others over Vegas' best Chinese style knife cut \"QQ\" (ie, al dente) noodles. Located off the strip proximate to the Palms Casino Resort, this modern meets age old traditional Chinese style noodle-ry offers the warm opportunity to satiate your cravings to teleport to old Shanghai (or Taiwan?) and enjoy oodles of delicious knife cut noodles; a fun dumpling fling; and more...  Against the backdrop of Vegas' vibrant and colored music scene, a bite into the chewy noodles will have you jamming: 'she Shangs she Shangs, oh baby, she chews she chews, I go crazy cause it looks a little sour, but it stings like a bee, the yummiest hand pulled noodles in historyyyy.'   My favorites?  (1) The Spicy Wonton (ie notice the notation HOT next to it on the menu  - A little smaller than usual, this appetizer dish is comprised of mini spicy wontons tossed in a house special spicy sauce, sesame, and green onions. The sauce is so delicious it can be eaten with rice and make for quite a delicious meal in itself.   (2) The Shang Beef Noodle (with Knife Shaven Noodle) ()- Witness the Noodle master carefully pull and cut the knife shaven noodles in front of your eyes. The aroma of the beef and chicken broth with aromatic star anise based traditional five spices waft to your inner depths of your soul. This is the only soul mate I need - it was love at first bite. The QQ tender noodles so expertly balanced against the depth of the beef broth, with just the right about of crunch from the baby bok choy and green onions has got my mind dreaming.   Note: you may elect from 1 of 3 types of noodles: hand-pulled noodles; knife shaven noodles; and plain noodles. I hands down recommend the knife shaven noodles.   Shang, your delicious bowls of knife shaven noodles have given me a safe haven - a humble retreat from the opulence of the strip - my heart S(h)ang...",

A hearty meal at it's core, the noodles are a great start to the weekend. The Shang Beef Noodles seem to be the most popular option as that is what I also chose. There are three different options of noodles, and I am sure that all three are good options.  With my meal, I chose the knife-shaved noodle. They are basically chunks of noodles to go along with your beef noodles. To be honest, the beef noodle soup wasn't anything special. It's good, but it does not shine as much as the noodles. From the taste of the noodles, I knew it was fresh and made to order. They also give you a heaping serving of beef chunks which always helps to make the restaurant stand out.   I like this place for the fact that the servings are big, the noodles are fresh, and the soup is good. Not sure if it would be worth if it there was a giant line out the door though. I did enjoy the hearty meal at the start of the weekend.",

They have option for hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I got the knife cut noodles which were amazing. They were thick and soaked up the broth.  - the wontons were soo good they were the perfect amount of spice and super juicy - onion pancakes were crispy on the outside and hella juicy on the inside   Service is great, they came around often to pour us their cucumber flavored water.  - took about a 25 minute wait we came on a Saturday noon time for lunch. It's pretty small and crowded, located in shopping plaza with a great boba place next door as well. I was happy and full :)",

You know it's a great place when Google, Trip Advisor, Yelp, Zagat, hotel bartenders and a couple of locals HIGHLY recommend this gem.    My friend and I walked in 20 minutes before closing....now, at most most restaurants, the staff would moan and groan - not here.  We were warmly greeted, seated and given the menu. I had done some research ahead of time and knew I HAD TO order the dan-dan noodles and the spicy wontons...we asked our waiter for any recommendations, he suggested the beef shank soup and we ordered it.  When the food was brought to us, it was like the heavens parted and the angels sang.  The dan-dan noodles were the best I've ever had, the spicy wontons were worth their weight in gold. (The spice had a slow kick....you'll think, \"where the heat\" and then you feel it.) The beef shank soup was delicious!  The meat was nice and tender with tons of flavor - the broth.....just put it in an I.V. bag and stick it in my veins.  Have I sang the praises of the noodles?  If not, I should.  The hand pulled noodles are deliciously al dente.  They deserve an award or a song.  Yes, the humble noodle is that good.  Seriously, do yourself a favor, get away from The Strip and visit this local gem.  Your wallet and tastebuds will thank you.   (Before I leave town, I will be visiting and getting another order of dan -dan noodles and some of their beef pancake.)",

It literally revived me from a 4.5 hr drive with its delicious soup, flavorful beef shank, and chewy noodles; I got the Beef Shank Noodles with Hand-pulled Noodles.  Besides my own dish, I also got to try my family's dishes which were all AMAZING. The Dan-Dan Noodles was spicy, but everything came together very well. Pairing the dish with the Cucumber Salad was the best life decision I've made in awhile. The Cucumber Salad was, of course, refreshing with fresh cucumber chunks drowsed in peanut sauce; I was in love.  The Shang Beef Noodles came with tender beef brisket and had a slightly darker flavor compared to the Beef Shank because of the addition of chilli oil and paste. It was, nevertheless, super enjoyable as well.   We also got the Beef & Onion Boiled Dumplings and Fried Rice to share. The Dumplings were decent, but not mind-blowing. On the other hand, the Fried Rice was very well-fried, dry and smoky, with plenty of shrimp, ham, and veggies.  It was hard to fault Shang in its food and service. Although the place was packed, the staffs worked very efficiently and got through the queue of customers swiftly. I'm so glad to have found and tried Shang. Its beef noodles will forever be in my memory.",

The hand pulled noodles are on point, and the spicy wontons are some of the best I've ever had.   Noodles are all about \"mouth texture\" as my mom would say, and Shang has got that down! The noodles are perfectly chewy and fresh. I am only sad that my stomach isn't big enough to try both the dry and wet noodles. Guess it's another reason to come back to Vegas!",

Definitely not a place to socialize or hang out because there's always people waiting to be seated and you feel rushed.   I like their spicy wonton, perfect burst of flavor in my mouth. It is now $5.99 and got like 6 pieces of wonton (not the biggest either). When I saw that it was so small, I had to order another one for the hubby. Noodle soup wise, I ordered both the hand pull and knife cut. It taste the same like anywhere else, really nothing special and at $9.95 each. My total bill came out to $35. I live in Vegas, at this rate I can eat any where. Definitely a nice experience but I would not go out of my way to come here for it, I'll settle for a hearty bowl of Pho any day.",

Besides that, everything was fast and smooth and efficient.  I got the pork ribs soup with hand pulled noodle and being curious as I was, I ordered a side of the hand shaven noodle as a side as well. I also got the beef pancake.  The noodle soup came out first and it was in decent size bowl. I was more amazed at the portion of the hand shaven noodle..it was humongous for an extra $1.50! The soup was amazing, I slurped that soup until there was nothing left. The pork ribs were eh, I could do without it as it didn't really do anything to the dish. As for the noodles, you can tell the difference between shaved and pulled as the pulled noodle was chewier and sturdier. The shaved noodle was softer and would have gone really well with a dry style dish. Both were delicious though.  The beef pancake was also delicious. They were fat, crispy and plump on the outside and filled with soup on the inside. I love the sweet-ish siy sauce as it compliment the dumplings very well.   Overall, portion, price, efficiency and quality exceeded my expectations and I would definitely come back for sure",

As I put my name on the waiting list, I counted 26 people in front of me!!!  Not acceptable. We left for my plan B stop in Chinatown (Mian).  A week later after we hiked 6 national parks , we had our second attempt. This time it was a Tuesday, also around 11:30 am.  No line and plenty of tables available.   We ordered Shang Beef Noodle and Pork Belly Noodle, $9.95 each.  Since we sat at the bar, we got to watch the noodle master hand-pull and cook our noodles. There were also classic Chinese miniature dining rooms on display at the bar counter which were pretty cool to see.  We knew when our noodles were ready because we observed the entire cooking process. The Shang Beef Noodle soup was simply perfect. The noodle, beef, and the broth...all spot on.  I really couldn't find any bone to pick.  The flavor of the broth was similar to the Taiwanese beef soup, my favorite variety.  The Pork Belly Noodle soup, on the other hand, was a bit on the salty side, overwhelmed by soy sauce. I would not recommend it.   I was very happy with my experience. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

While in the Uber, I gave her the \"... slow head turn\" look of disappointment at each missed stoplight (9 total).....   Sixteen minutes later, we arrive. From the time we sat down, we were all smiles, toes wiggling, and holding each other's leg.  After the great suggestions from the waiter, we ordered. We watched the cook toss and twirl our hand cut noodles. We received our food and retreated deeper into our heavenly place!!!!

It had brown sauce on it with a hint of sesame oil. While you are enjoying the meal, you can watch the staff preppin' the noodles. You choose from 3 different kinds of noodles: Hand-pulled, Knife-shaved noodle or regular noodle. We went for the Hand-pulled noodle!  Staff were friendly and attentive.

The Shang Beef Noodle soup was nice. It'd give it a 4/5 stars. The flavor just wasn't for me, but everyone in my party enjoyed it. I'd like to try the beef shank or pork belly if we come back.  One item that we did order that was fire were the Pork & Cabbage Potsticker.  Seating is pretty limited so expect a wait. We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday night which wasn't terrible.",

I was blown away by the noodle craftsmanship bestowed upon me and it made the 20 min wait much more bearable with my pending hunger and childlike impatience.   BUT yes... there is one negative and that is the WAIT TIME. The restaurant is quite small with some tables and a bar section. I did come in with a party of 7 around 8:30pm on the weekend. So I highly recommend arriving earlier or be granted a long and uncomfortable time of waiting around.   NOW ONTO THE BEST PART ..THE FOOD!!   SHANG BEEF NOODLE SOUP: 5/5 Makes sense that this seems like their most popular item on the menu. It had extremely tender chunks of beef and fresh boychoy. The noodles were soft and chewy. The soup held tons of flavor. Everything was perfectly balanced ..as all things should be. :D  SPICY WONTONS: 5/5  Soft and juicy wontons filled with meat in a bowl of chili oil sauce. Simple dish yet it was packed full of flavor and was around delicious.   PEKING ZHA JIANG NOODLES: 5/5  Came with an array of vegetables including carrots, edamame beans, sprouts, and cucumber. The sauce had pieces of minced pork. Definitely get this if you're looking at their \"sauce noodle\" menu section.  Also, I want to add that their wooden utensils with their engraved restaurant's name add to their whole aesthetic. Many people would overlook the small detail but I thought it just added another level of depth to the place.   OK LASTLY and a small disclaimer..  I know I'm not the best at describing food and flavor..but I do know when the food is GOOD. My descriptions don't do the food justice so please stop debating to come here and give this place a try. It's a MUST!",

I cherished first moments in my life, and often wonder if I could experience that again. And I did. This time it was at Shang Artisan Noodle. The way I taste, feel, and see noodles will never be the same. There's no going back.  There are so many noodle houses in this city. Options are endless. As I've learned from my past, you never judge a book by its cover. This noodle shop is in a strip mall. It honestly lacked that authentic Asian store front I would expect from a decently high rated location in Las Vegas. Upon entering I noticed this shop is smaller than I expected. At the front you will find a noodle boy rolling long ropes of noodles for show. We were greeted by a pleasant waiter as soon as we enter. He sat us closer to the back of the shop. Most of the seating were empty which I was pleasantly surprise considering the reviews of others consistently long wait time is expected. This is a tiny place with probably 50 max seating.  Taking a first glance at the menu I found that their offering was very simple. Which I really like. There was a list  of appetizers to choose from. Then I started to glance over their noodle items. It's the main reason I'm here. They serve three cut style of noodles. I wasn't familiar at all to any of them so I needed more assistance with that. Staff was pleasant and service was good. I opted for a shaved noodles.   Now, when you're at Shang artisan noodle..I swear you cannot go wrong with whichever bowl you choose. Feeling nostalgic, I opted for their tomato egg sauce with add on bean sprouts and spinach (delicious add on available for extra $$) it's a dish I remember vividly from my childhood. That dish reminds me of grandmother. The noodles came real shortly after our order. I mixed my noodle bowl around and my first bites were so surreal. I felt transported back to my childhood in East village. The next bite I had screamed where am I? The noodles was cooked perfect with incredible texture, and chew. I felt like I was eating in a shop in China. Wow..wow.. just amazing. I had a taste of my partner's noodle bowl. He opted for the beef broth soup. I had a spoon full of his broth, and oh my. Nom nom nom. I was actually speechless.  This is probably the longest review I have ever done for Yelp. But you get the idea. Shang Artisan Noodle is a place you don't want to miss! if you want not only good noodles, but food that literally entertain all your senses and takes you back or forward to memory lanes look no further!",

I'm not sure I would be able to find a beef noodle place as good in LA... and that's saying a lot.  I got the beef shank noodle soup and I could not stop drinking the broth, which, honestly, is the best part of this dish.  There were big heavy cuts of beef and tons of noodles!   Overall, great experience and amazing food. I will be back when I come into/go out of Vegas again!",

Day after, we were so hungover, my wife suggested that we go get some soup with noodles. Our usual go-to is a Vietnamese Pho joint but my wife asked if I likes traditional Chinese food and I said no because... Well... I never had it! After a bit of debate of what it is and why we should try it..etc.. Finally, I gave in and went to this place. Right when I got in, I was bit confused because it said Chinese Artisan Noodle and they are famous for their TRADITIONAL CHINESE NOODLES, but it was small and very contemporary, almost looked like a chain restaurant. Everything aside, we got seated and ordered what my wife had already researched and chosen for both of us... Yes.. The staffs were very nice and helpful. The order came out faster than expected, which also raised another red flag, but I was hungry, hungover and just needed something in my stomach. So, she ordered the Shang hand-pulled beef noodle and dan-dan noodle, which is a spicy soy sauce with minced pork and veggies. The Shang beef noodle!! My man!! The soup was red but but spicy.. and the braised beef brisket... Was the most tender and perfectly cooked and there were a lot floating in the bowl, I almost cried... It was superb! It was about $10 but it was worth every penny. The dan-dan was not my kinda noodle dish, just because it was bit too spicy without the flavour to back it up. It was still good but I guess I was too blinded by the SHANG BEEF NOODLE! I saw that they had other great dishes, which I will definitely try next time I visit Vegas. I am a fan and I encourage everyone to try this place when you go to Vegas!!!",

Parking is a bit hard to find and there is always a line, no matter what time you go. However, as you wait, you can sip on some boba from the store next door. I'd have to admit, I was a bit underwhelmed by the flavors of the dishes. The best one was probably the cucumber appetizer, with the spicy wontons at a close second. As for entrees, I definitely preferred the soup noodles more than the dry ones. The soup had flavor, but not as much as the soup noodles I'm used to back home in the SGV. It was a bit pricey, and considering the two hour wait, I would say that I would not come back.",

    "text": "I'm down here in Vegas, and I just had to seek out one of these noodle places that specializes in, house made from scratch, hand pulled noodles as well as the knife cut noodles. No using big boxes of dried noodles here like some local chop suey joint. Coming from Sacramento area in CA, we have no hand pulled noodle places, I'd have to go to SF area and forget trying to park there! I was looking forward to trying hand pulled noodles for the first time. I think these are wheat based noodles, as opposed to rice (white), or egg (yellow), as they can be stretched and tossed about.  Shang Artisan Noodle has an easy location in a little strip mall with easy parking, right next door to a new Thai restaurant. Inside it's very modern and not real big. It can get crowded on weekend prime times. The kitchen noodle production is behind glass and you can easily watch the noodles being made and tossed about stretching the gluten in the noodles.   The menu is on the smaller side, hence they can concentrate on doing each dish well. They offer sections of appetizers, Noodle Soups, Sauced Noodles as well as fried rice and chow mein. The noodle dishes can be had with either hand pulled, Knife Shaved or plain noodles.  Prices average about $6.00 for appetizers including won tons, pot stickers and beef pancakes. The noodle soups are all around $10.00, including the traditional beef noodle soup to the more exotic pork belly noodle soup. The sauced noodles were all around $9.00 and included Dan Dan Noodles as well as the less seen Tomato and Egg noodles. If you really want something like fried rice or chicken chow mein, they have that here too. The full menu with prices is posted on their website.  I tried the appetizer of the Beef Pancake along with a bowl of the spicy Dan Dan Noodles. I've never had or seen a dish like the Beef Pancake, less like a pancake and more like the shape of a little crab cake. It was basically a dumpling with a thick skin with a beef mixture inside, pressed into that shape and browned on each side, like a pot sticker is browned on one side. It was good, but maybe not eyeball rolling back great. The food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly.   Next was the big bowl of noodles. It's served with all the separate ingredients presented on top of the noodles, then you mix it with chopsticks. There were no forks on the tables, so you better know how to use chopsticks ... it's not that hard, but I might say at times a fork may have been easier with these long noodles.   My first bite of these hand pulled fresh made noodles .... OMG! These are the most wonderful noodles I've ever had! The texture was just right and the feel in my mouth along with the spiciness was something you just gotta try! I really enjoyed this dish ... but I'm sad I can't get this at all where I live! Gotta get back to Vegas soon! You lucky people who live here, need to get over here and try the noodles! There was no language barrier at all, as it can be a problem at some ethnic food places. I'm eating here again next time I'm in Vegas!",

We even ordered 6 to go because that's how much we enjoyed it. Sadly, at home, the noodles aren't as chewy as they were fresh out the pot.   Texture-wise, we preferred the hand-pulled noodles over the knife-cut but both were good.   Definitely order the beef pancakes, which are more like fried juicy pork dunplings in thick dough. It was surprising to have juice oozing out so be careful not to burn yourself. I can eat this all day. Next time I visit vegas I'll be ordering these for delivery to the hotel room. 5/5  Spicy shrimp wontons were also good. Not memorable but not bad. 4/5  Per recommendation from the waiter we also had stir fried chicken and mushroom over white rice. It was okay. 3.5/5",

The potstickers were awesome because they were \"real\" potstickers - the residue of \"crust\" were still on the dumplings, so you know they were cooked the real traditional way. The chow mein with knife cut noodle was surprisingly good. I always associate chow mein with crappy Chinese take-out, but this plate gave me hope that chow mein could be a real delicacy. The best thing about the noodles was that they had some chew to them. The hand-pulled noodle pork belly soup was perfect for a slightly chilly afternoon after a hike in Red Rock Canyon. I wish there were more slices of pork belly, but the chewy noodles and tasty soup more than made up for it.   The waiter staff were fantastic - one guy was *almost* too chipper and happy, while the waitress was always there to fill out water up to the brim. It was really great service (something you don't always find in Chinese restaurants). Although it's a little off the strip, it's definitely worth the trip!",

The properly crafted, stretched, cut, & cooked noodles were the perfect arrival dinner in Vegas after a long drive! Spicy wontons were perfect bite sized appetizers. Interesting mala/spicy sauce. It wasn't that spicy, just enough heat to make your appetite to perk up. Ordered the knife cut dan dan noodles and hand pulled zhajiang noodles for entrees. Dan dan didn't look all that spicy but the heat kicks in after the slurping so be aware. Sauce is simply minced pork and peppers sauce. No sesame/peanut sauce. It was little more spicier than dan dan noodles I'm used to but delicious! It will wake up your tired scrunched up body from 4 hour drive from Cali to Vegas! Zhajiang noodle sauce with the minced pork was sweet, savory, & just delicious!! The fresh and crisp vegetables (edamame, carrots, cucumber, bean sprouts) added nice crunchness for the hand pulled noodle.  Service was friendly, fast, & accommodating! Our waters and teas were topped off without asking for refills. Food is made to order and since they make fresh noodles, everything came out very quickly! So happy to have found a great place for noodles in Vegas!",

He again came back to hand us tiny bowls and when placing the bowl down, he threw it into the table so rudely and saw the expressions on our face and then apologized forcefully. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or something but this place was good for the food! There was a female worker who was super kind and helpful though and she made the whole experience better. Ok now food wise, the Dan Dan noodles were super good! The noodles and sauce had a really \"creamy\" texture which I loved! The soup for the beef soup, was a delight as well and super flavorful!",

This place served the most legit beef noodle soup. The broth is really tasty but not overwhelming. Tbe hand-pulled noodles are fresh and just the right size and was not too doey like the way I like it. The meat is one of the best part also, it just kinda melts in your mouth. The price is definitely not overpriced as you would expect anywhere near the strip. I will for sure come back next time I visit vegas again, the noodle house even outmatch my go-to place back in Dallas.",

Plenty of food with some left overs.  All dishes were good.  Favorites were shang noodle soup and beef pancakes.  $25 total +tip   Great service. English speaking.

The texture was springy and chewy while being fully cooked through. Honestly, this is the texture I wanted from the pasta I had in Rome (which turned out to basically just be raw.) These noodles are a joyous experience to eat.   The noodles absorbed the lightly unctuous pork broth. The fresh chives added bitterness and crisp texture. The bok choy was hearty and pleasantly fresh.   The pork was admittedly just slightly dry on the bite. However, it was close to being perfect in execution. The mouthfeel of the pork was fall-apart.   The whole dish was savory and has just a slight unique sweetness.",

The had a large bar in the center of the restaurant and small 2-4 people tables against the wall. The chefs were in the bar area hand pulling noodles, filling dumplings and cooking food for people to watch!  Their noodles were so good - chewy, thick and plentiful!! We got the shang beef noodle and pork belly noodle with knife-cut noodles. Their meats were well cooked and seasoned, they added soft bok choy and a handful of scallions. I really enjoyed the broth for the pork belly noodles, it was thick and the flavors were subtle. My favorite was definitely the chicken and mushroom noodles which had eggs, a light sauce and bok choy. (Maybe I just love eggs too much!)  Would recommend sharing dishes and trying all the noodles!!",

It was a Friday night and we got seated in about 15 minutes even though there was a line. We ordered and within 5 minutes the food came out. We ordered the Shang Beef Noodle, Dan Dan Noodle, and the spicy wonton.   The aroma and the flavor of the broth was delicious and the Dan Dan noodle was great as well. It doesn't have a strong scent or strong after taste like many places. But the hand pull did not live up to the hype. It tasted a little like regular noodles and I was really hoping for a chewy texture.  The spicy wonton was okay. I'd recommended trying it though if it's your first time. The sauce is a little sweet spicy and they are small wontons.  It is a small space so expect a wait. It's also a small parking lot.",

Try to get here earlier, as by the time we got here (6 PM), there was already a line.  We did get seated relatively quickly at the bar, and it was great to watch the chefs work on making more noodles.  My kids were entertained the whole time by them, which is a difficult feat these days.  We ordered a number of dishes to sample each type - hand-made noodles, knife-cut noodles, and the dumplings.  The food was authentic and had plenty of seasoning.  Food was served in a reasonable amount of time - basically, I had the sense that as soon as I ordered, they were making the noodles and dough to fill the order.  While there were always people waiting in line to get in, I never got the sense that we had to rush out.  Overall, a fantastic experience, with great food.  Next time I come back to Las Vegas, I'd definitely come back.",

Even my mom loved it, and she is cautious around asian cuisine. I recently moved from Seattle to Raleigh. Raleigh is an asian cuisine desert, and I really missed the authentic flavors available back home. I'm glad I came to Las Vegas if only for this restaurant.",

It's a tower of cucumber wedges served with a generous drizzle of satay sesame sauce. Sooo good and refreshing from the Vegas heat! We ordered 3 for the table, which was way too much.   We also got the beef pancake, beef and onion pot sticker, and beef and onion boiled dumplings. The pot stickers were joined together by a crispy thin batter and looked beautiful! Everyone liked all the appetizers a lot.   For my entree I tried the 'Tomato & Egg Noodle'. As a child I grew up having traditional tomato and egg... but it was always over rice. This was my first time having it over noodles. Don't get me wrong, I loved the creativity... but I would have preferred a more traditional Asian noodle dish. As a vegetarian, this was the only entree option on the menu.   My husband got the signature 'Shang Beef Noodle' and thought it was good, could really taste the beef in the broth and had a very meaty flavor.   The set up was super cool where you can look in and see the noodle guy making fresh noodles. I loved the decor and feeling of a modern noodle house.   For the price and quality and creativity, I'd give it 5 stars.  For the taste I'd give it 4 stars. So we'll round to 5.",

First of all, there's really not that many hand pulled noodle places around but what makes this the best for me was the generous amount of tender juicy pieces of beef in a mild spicy broth that wasn't too salty.  Noodles were the right texture and everything on point.  Also tried the Dan Dan noodles and thought it was too salty.  Pot stickers were ok.   So my 5 star rating is really geared towards the great friendly service, nice little place and the best beef noodle soup at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "I have to first say I have been dying to try this type of place but this is my first so I have nothing to compare it to.  That's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 stars.  The first portion of my review will (hopefully) be humorous.  My only experience with hand made noodles is from cooking shows.  Every single time there is an Asian person making them.  I walked in expecting to see something like on TV but nope... Here's a tatted up ginger flinging noodles.  I laughed out loud at myself \"stereotype shattered\".   In fact, I thought it was so funny I commented to the waiter who was lighthearted himself. Turns out the person making the noodles was teaching another guy how to do it.    Now the rest: 1. Super clean 2. Very reasonably priced 3. Great Service 4. I ordered beef noodle.  Great savory broth. Love the fresh cilantro. Meat seemed like short rib & could have used a little more cooking but still tasty but not quite that tender to falling apart. 5. Big portion.  I ate half and took the other half to go. Reheat was great so basically I got 2 meals for under $10  It's in a strip mall so parking was tight when I arrived but cleared out 15 minutes later when the nail salon next door was closing up.  There's a McDonalds next door with big lot and no signs saying \"McD parking only\" so that was fine.  They do not have dessert because there's a small shop next door with desserts.  I tried that too and just not my thing. I would just go a few blocks to Sweets Roku.   It's a bit of a drive but I'm definitely going back.",

It's pretty tough to find a noodle shop that makes good shaven noodles so I'm glad I was able to find this little gem. Inside is really cozy and clean- came to dine around 3:30pm on a Saturday and there are still quite a few parties eating there.   - Spicy wonton: not very good. It's like little Shanghai wonton where it's not big and not much stuffing. There's no flavor and not spicy at all. Highly NOT recommended.  - Shang beef noodle soup: really really realllllly good! We got it with shaven noodle. Broth is perfect- very flavorful and not overly salty. The noodle was beyond amazing. Thick and chewy! -beef pancake: this was okay. The pan cakes by themselves are a little plain but the dipping sauce that they give you makes up for it. Possibly worth trying at least once!  There was only 1 waiter working when we were there so the service was a little slow and it was hard to get his attention. But all and all, very good noodle and that's all that matters! Will be back for sure!",

The beef 'pancake' is actually amazing juicy flavorful dumplings-- be careful or the juice will squirt out! I highly recommend these.  We did try the cold chicken sesame noodles with the hand pulled.  Although tasty, I did feel that maybe the hand pulled noodles lacked the chewy quality I always look for in a noodle.  Not that they were bad-- just that we enjoyed the knife cut texture so much.  This place will definitely warrant a return visit!",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best restaurants I've ever dined.  The fresh hand pulled noodles are a work of art and when combined with a broth that has been slow simmered for hours so the the flavors are magnified, let me just say, it's a treat.  The dumplings are given this detailed and unique presentation to compliment the wonderful taste.  They take their time to give you a special dining experience.  Looking at the prices it would be easy to think of this place like any other noodle bar.  It is not.  Clean, attentive service, and a cozy atmosphere that still feels fresh and energetic.  When you consider practically everything on this menu is under $10, a five-star rating is a no brainer.  I last visited this place in May 2018.  I will be returning to Vegas once or twice this year and this place is the one place I am looking forward to more than any other.  Yes, it's that good if you can appreciate the artistry of hand pulled noodles and cuisine.",

It was dry with very little untasty sauce and crumbs of I donk know what kind of meat. The pork fried rice was bland and masked with tons of green onions. The boiled pork and cabbage dumplings tasted like mush and smelled. What the heck are the reviewers thinking? I know this is not all Vegas has to offer. I have had some of the tastiest Dan Dan Noodles on the strip, this place just happened to be close to our resort.",

However, the pot stickers are 5 stars: very fresh and crispy. The flavor is just right. I would come back but will ask for less salt on the wontons next time if that's possible.",

Staff was friendly and knowledgeable, Pita gave great recommendations. She explained the differences in the noodles and what the most popular dishes were and house favorites. We started with the cucumber salad, beef pancakes, and spicy wontons. The cucumber was unique and good. Beef pancakes were really nice. The spicy wontons were a little bland. For entrees I ordered the Dan Dan Noodle and my girlfriend ordered the Beef Shank Noodle.  The Dan Dan Noodle is a dish without sauce and was great by itself but adding chili oil made it much much better. The beef shank was very flavorful; the broth was a little bit on the sweet side for my taste and the shank was not as tender as I'd hoped but overall a great dish. The only issue I mainly had was that when we ordered the food, my food came out way, way before my girlfriend's food. So my dish had to sit for a bit before touching it since hers didn't come out.   Food - 4 Service - 4 Cleanliness - 5 Ambiance - 5",

Not only are the hand pulled noodles exceptionally delicious, you get a front row seat of the open kitchen where you get to watch the magic happen.  Watching the pulling process occur before your eyes is oddly hypnotic, and it made me appreciate how good the food was once it arrived (which was very quick, I might add).  The menu offers a great deal of variety, and each dish that we tried did not disappoint.  We ordered the Tomato & Egg Noodle (a curious combination, but scrumptious) and the Chicken Chow Mein, both of which tasted incredible at very low prices.  The service was spot on, and our server Ciara was friendly and courteous from when we arrived, to when we finished up and left.  Even better, not only was she very personable, she had a keen knowledge of the menu, and knew exactly what to recommend for us with it being our first visit.  Stay tuned, as Shang Artisan will be adding beer & sake to the menu soon.  Until then, swing by and enjoy some delectable cuisine!",

Noodles are on point with texture, you can get the legit hand pulled vs knife cut types. The soup is perfect balance of rich beefiness, salty and a little sweet.

The red bean tofu pudding was not overly sweet, the tofu had the consistency I like and the red bean was tender.  The almond soup was also really good, not sweet and very wholesome.  These desserts would be perfect on a cold rainy day.  They are still in Grand Opening phase so you can't miss it on Spring Mountain.

There's plenty of touted Asian restaurants on the strip but they're often aggrandized and showy (what can you expect in Vegas though, right?).  Enter Shang - the food here is authentic, delicious and fresh. They even have one guy behind the counter constantly pulling fresh noodles by hand all night. The staff was genuinely very friendly and the fact that they offer 3 (THREE!) different options of noodle is amazing. The various dumplings are great as well. Best of all? Everything here is served hot, the way it should be.   Thank you Shang! We'll be back again.",

The outer appearance may seem like its dry but these pancakes are crunchy on the outside with flavorful beef and soup on the inside. For our entrees, we got the Shang Beef with hand pulled noodles and Pork Belly with hand pulled noodles. All the components in the shang beef was really put together. The beef was tender and the broth is not too light nor too rich. I believe you can also adjust how spicy you would like the broth to be. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly because the cut of the pork was just too big and overly fatty. I'm a big fan of pork belly but this was one was just a little too much for me.   Another bonus is that not only is this place clean, the staff is amazing! Our waiter was nice and the service was prompt and fast.   5/5 Service 4/5 Food 5/5 Cleanliness",

Beef was too fatty for my taste, but I'm sure some love it. Need to add chili, so it's not so starchy.  Ordered the knife cut chicken/mushroom gravy noodles. Found it a little too \"gravyish\" for my taste.   Got the kids hand cut chicken chow mien. Delicious! Fresh cabbage, onions, large pieces of chicken. Needed some acid to balance it, so added the dipping sauce meant for the potstickers.   1 order of steamed beef dumplings- not as good as Din Tai Fung, but also about half the price. Din Tai Fung uses a thinner wrapper. More sophisticated and complex. This is thicker and more rustic.   The pan fried dumplings have a cool crispy layer on top- almost like a cheese skirt, but Asian :). Definitely need the soy dipping sauce to cut the grease.  Beef pancakes were good, but again, thicker skin, while I prefer a thinner skin. Felt it was a lot of carbs.   The table next to us order the cucumbers. Would highly recommend, as it would add crunchy and something healthy to break up the starch.   Overall, reasonable, authentic and tasty. Wouldn't recommend to a diabetic, but great if you like carbs and noodles!",

The noodles were the perfect chewy texture and had a nice doughy flavor. The broth was intensely seasoned without being too salty, which is difficult to find at a noodle shop. It's off the beaten path with a small dining area, but I would absolutely recommend stopping here to carboload before a night out or a night in.

The Shang Beef Noodles tasted like other beef noodle soups that similar restaurants. It didn't really stand out. The Chicken Sesame Cold Noodles were very saucy but on the bland side. The Pork & Cabbage Dumplings were flavorful and very addicting, but my main problem were the Dan-Dan Noodles.  It didn't look like other dan-dan noodles I've had. Are there different types of dan-dan noodles? This one did not have that peanutty sauce. It had a pork pickling and it was EXTREMELY salty. It was so salty, we had to order an extra side of noodles.  Coming from SoCal where Chinese food is plentiful (especially in the Rowland Heights/Diamond Bar area), I should have had lower expectations. Overall, this place will only cure noodle cravings for locals.",

As soon as he mentioned \"hand pulled noodles\" I was all in for it! Wasn't sure what to expect since I'm scared of trying new things but boy let me just say this place is so so SO goooooood! The place is small and cute! Very cozy and homey. The atmosphere is very laid back and chill unlike other ramen/ noodle houses. The food quality is AMAZING! Like I said I came back twice!!! Try this place out if you're looking for delicious food and wonderful service!",

    "text": "In almost every way, Shang deserves a 5 star review.  We drove through abominable Vegas traffic to get to the restaurant, only to find a large crowd of people standing outside.  There was a group of 35 (yes, you read that right) waiting.  This is for a restaurant that seats about 30.  When we arrived, only about 10 of the 35 had already been seated.  There were others waiting for tables, too.  Some were couples, some groups of 3, some groups of 4.  As we watched members of the large group sit over their empty plates, we were getting as steamed as the noodles.    For their part, the restaurant tried to accommodate everyone as best they could.  They worked to get people seated as soon as a place cleared.  Honestly, though, they should either have refused the group of 35 or closed and called it a private party.  The upside is that we had lots of time to chat with others who were waiting for a table.  Most of the folks we talked to were regulars, and they all made suggestions on what we should order.  We ended up with the Shang Beef Noodle (requested hand cut) and the Dan Dan Noodle.  The Shang was excellent, with flavorful broth and tender brisket.  The noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right about of chew to them.  The Dan Dan was also good, but I would order the Shang next time.  The sauce was delicious, but I can't say that I care for the taste of the preserved veggies.  That's more a comment on my own taste in food than on the quality of the dish.  To each his own, right?  Again, the noodles were as perfect in the Dan Dan as they were in the Shang.  I've added Shang Artisan Noodles to my go to list for Vegas.  Be sure to give them a try the next time you decide to gamble away your fortune.",

The highlight was the beef short rib meat. Has an adequate amount of fat on it that adds TONS of flavor. Also, go for the spicy wanton side dish. Will give you the head sweats but sweet enough for you to keep eating it.   Clean place, attentive staff, reasonable price.   Add more snap on noodles will get them an easy 5 star.",

I had previously tried dumplings in a spicy soy sauce at a commercialized competitor in California and have been on the hunt for similar style dumplings. These dumplings are so delicious and fresh. The sauce is like soy with some five spice like flavor and fresh ground chili oil. It was delicious. I dipped my noodles wet and dry into it. I got the pork belly noodles at the recommendation of the server and the flavor was good. My family that ordered the the shang noodle and they all loved it. They said it reminded them of a Vietnamese bo kho. The fried rice was the only down side. Looked Americanized with peas, carrots and corn. The flavor was pretty bland. The chicken chow mein with hand drawn noodles was probably my favorite. The flavor was just perfect. I would absolutely come again to try more food. Be careful, this place only seats about 30 people so I imagine it would be a very long wait on peak hours and weekends.",

It was \"National Noodle Day\" apparently so when we got a quick break to sneak away from campus we came to get our noodle on.  Personally the only time I eat noodles, if and when, I'll grab a pack of chicken flavor top ramen. I'm not big on the authentic Asian noodle cuisine. However, I do love me some pho. Anyways since I was in the mood to try something new we came by. The promo on their Instagram was worded incorrectly according to our awesome and super friendly server. They did bring a taster of their Dan Dan noodle to our table that my friend ate. Hence, I don't eat pork. She did enjoy her mini sampler however. The server stated it was one of their popular dishes like a few of the reviews have noted. I got the beef shank with a side of their chili paste. The chili paste was delicious!!! Also, I ordered the beef and onion pot stickers. The texture of the meat inside the pot stickers didn't do it for me. My friend order their chili wontons with pork and she enjoyed it very much. She highly recommended it. I love the concept of the open kitchen with the view of the chef make fresh noodles right before your eyes. This is my second and third time giving noodles a try. Well folks everything isn't for everyone. The water infused with watermelon was unique too but I like my water with lemon. I guess there was no pleasing me but my friend rated them a 4 out of 5! I'd have to agree if I could get in on the noodle and ramen tread perhaps. Lol",

Although the noodles aren't as chewy and elastics as I would like them, the portions are downright satisfying and the beef and pork slices are absolutely delicious. The soup is light if you go with the clear broth, like I did. My friends ordered the soy sauced braised pork belly noodles, and their broth was very rich in flavor.   Both are highly recommended. The prices are fair and you won't find a better deal around town especially anywhere near the strip.",

A new noodle shop in Vegas doesn't sound all that intriguing considering all the big name restaurants and buffets which... well, screams \"Vegas\". However, their display of commitment to their craft was enough to sway me.   FIRST, a warning. Their water is watermelon infused... not THAT big of a deal but I dislike watermelon. If you're in the same boat, there's good old plain tap.  Hand pulled noodles, soups, dumplings... all of which I'm familiar with but GOD DAMN... their Beef Noodle soup is the best I've had thus far. The flavor of the broth... I can barely put into words, let alone keep myself from passing out. Strong beef flavor, spices/aromatics were well-balanced, all which led to an ideal, assertive soup. The hearty pieces of beef were very tender (thank god), the hand pulled noodles were great, the hidden pieces of bok Choy beneath the dark robust soup were pleasant... all of these components merging to a near-perfect singularity... I just passed out.   All of this however, was after the initial revelation that is the Beef Pancake. As I said before, this was no stranger to me, BUT THE AMOUNT OF JUICE AND FLAVOR THAT POURED OUT of the little sucker.... it was like an episode of Food Wars: Shokugeki No Soma.... foodgasm x100, an explosion of all sorts of things and feels... clothes ripping off... exaggeration of course, but so legit nonetheless. The only negative critique that my friend and I both had was that it could have be crispier. There was only a modest size surface area which was pleasantly crunchy, but more would have been better.  We also had their spicy wontons and Dan Dan Noodles which were just okay. I've had better Dan Dan noodles elsewhere (lacking in the flavor department) and their spicy wontons needs a couple more tweaks to get onto Din Tai Fung's level... DTF is just too good.   Regardless, the beef dishes made this 5 star happen.",

I've spent years trying to find an authentic noodle restaurant that won't break the bank and this is it! We also had the pork dumplings which were fabulous!!!!! If you want a place with amazing service, a noodle show, and some bomb food, you have to come to this restaurant!",

Saw this place on Yelp and arrived on the spot at exactly 11:00 AM with my wife and father in law. Place was easy to find and looked clean and modern. Really liked the decor. Archer the waiter was nice and knowledgeable. Writing this review as we speak. The cucumber salad just arrived. Looks nice and tasty. When the noodles came out...wow! Fresh and delicious. We really liked this place. This place rivals many of the noodle places in San Francisco. Thanks to all the Yelp reviewers that we found this gem!",

I don't eat meat so I figured since they have these ingredients it would not be a problem to make me a vegan chow mein because many of the other hand pulled noodle places had vegan options or were willing to customize. I like having mushrooms in the noodles mean because it more closely resembles a meaty texture, so I don't get bored eating it. They refuse to customize the noodles, so I had no choice but to leave. I don't understand when they have all the ingredients necessary why it would be an issue to make a stir fry noodle dish with those two items. I am not getting meat and told them they could charge me for a dish with meat even tho dishes with meat are more expensiv, instead they told me know so I had no choice but to eat elsewhere. Vegetarians and vegans don't come here. There's nothing for us here. Take your business to magic noodle house a few miles down. The noodles are delicious there and they are very accommodating to our needs!",

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I personally prefer the hand pulled noodles to be a little bit thinner than this. Too thick and tough. The properly done string pulled noodle should be slightly thinner, smooth yet a little chewy at the same time. Again, this is personal preference. Overall, great place!",

Spicy wonton: small little wontons in a mild spicy sweet soy sauce  Beef pancakes: this one was my favorite out of the whole meal. These little guys were packed with soup and just the right amount of flavor.   I had higher expectations for this place, but I would only come here if I was craving for the beef pancakes. My friend and I definitely left this restaurant feeling really thirsty. So there might be a chance of extra salt or just msg.",

    "text": "This is my second time leaving a review, first was with a restaurant with fantastic food and exceptional service, this time it Le because of extremely poor service. I have contemplated to write about this review for it could potentially impact a business, but I thought about it, this needs to be addressed if the restaurant is to improve and be present over the years.   This was one of my favorite places for a meal when I visit Vegas till Monday night. Not sure if the wait staff was off and or the chef was off... the food was off and the service was an area of major improvement needed.   My wife and I visited around 8.45pm on March 4th.  To be fair; the sole reason why I like this place is because of the noodles, really like the hand made noodles, great texture... we ordered the beef pancakes, chicken chow mien and Jia hang mien. To start, the meal was going well and the waiter refilled my water with a piece of scallion in my water (not sure if a piece made it in to the water carafe or if the carafe wasn't rinsed well during the wash). Asked the waiter waiter to replace my water and the waiter simply laughed and gave me a new glass... maybe I was expecting too much? An attempt to make this situation wasn't anywhere near to be found. The jia jang mien was ok, the hand made noodle had the text I was looking forward too, but little on the salty side... not too uncomfortably salty but enough to noice and needing a lot of water during the meal. The chicken chow mien on the other hand was way too salty... and the noodle texture was over cooked... was going to let this go... and even the water incident until I asked for the bill.  The waiter asked if the meal was good, told him that it was not... An expected response should be somewhere between concern and an attempt to correct the issue with your customer... rather the waiter smiles and said ok and brought me my bill. If this was going to be the response then why did you ask? Is this how the employees are trained? What a poor service... food was not good but it could have been an off day... would've been willing to give this place one more chance, but do not want to go back after this horrible service",

I LOVE that these noodles are cut the way you want them and they're fresh handmade noodles! You actually can see them cut the noodles and knead the dough right in front of you. We ordered the wontons that came in a spicy chili oil sauce and a noodle dish that had minced beef on top with lots of scallions. Both dishes were really good, next time I'll ask for less scallions since I'm not a huge fan of them. Very reasonably priced too for what it is, would come back for sure esp if I'm craving noodles!",

Their water is delicately infused with cucumber and it was delightful! All four of us chose to have their signature Shang Beef Noodle dish with hand-pulled noodles. Oh yum! The deep-brown broth was fragrant and savory and the beef more than fork tender! Just about melted in your mouth! The noodles were soft and tender, and this soup dish included bits of mustard cabbage, also flavorful. All of us were first-time diners here and enjoyed this very filling lunch. We told each other that we'd be back!",

    "text": "This is a rather charming restaurant with modern decor and seem to emphasize simplicity: minimum ingredients used, but as fresh and house-made as possible.  This is seen from the hand-made noodles to the bok choy and beef as the sole ingredients.  Spicy Wonton Chili oil.  Lots of it.  If you order this, I recommend you eat this quickly because parts of it is crispy (well done!).  If you leave it in the oil for too long, it'll diminish this crispy texture which may not be desirable.  This is a great appetizer, but I personally thought it was a bit too heavy, especially in preparation for the main entree.  Shang Beef Noodle Beef brisket is really soft and breaks very easily.  Not an iota of roughness.  Simply delectable and goes very well with the broth and the noodles.    For the noodles, you can opt for either hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or plain noodle.  I've had the opportunity to try both the hand-pulled and knife-shaved.  Knife-shaved is thicker, less consistent in texture, and chewier.  The dough seem to leave a lasting impression in your mouth and seem to balance the broth's rich flavor.  For the hand-pulled noodle, it's definitely easier to bite and enjoy, with less of the dough flavor and more of the broth, if you like that kinda thing.  I definitely prefer the hand-pulled more, but my fiancee loved the knife-shaved (we switched bowls)...or maybe it just tastes better when it's not coming from your own bowl...    Regardless of the noodle choices, this place is definitely delectable with a very reasonable price point that gets my nod of approval.",

The appetizer came out after, but was not what we ordered. Finally got the right appetizer out and it was bland and feels undercooked.  Could be better. I'll come back for the noodles but nothing else.  Hopefully I get my meal after everyone else, that way my noodles don't get cold so I can enjoy it.",

Despite the noodles being homemade, I was actually a bit disappointed with how tough they were. Maybe I just like my noodles softer but I preferred the homemade noodles at Noodle Man more.  My favorite dish was actually the beef pancake appetizer! It's $5 for 4 pan-seared pancakes and beware of how juicy they are! Definitely try to poke a hole before biting or cutting into it - don't say I didn't warn you!  I've tried the Shang Beef Noodle and the broth's flavor wasn't memorable for me. I do like the portion size and the amount of beef that they give though! The beef was quite tender and fresh. This dish is probably the best bet here for me.   I've also had the Dan Dan noodles which I was disappointed with since Shang's version doesn't have the classic peanut flavor. To me, the combination of peanut + spice makes the dish. They got the spice part down though! The dish also includes ground pork but the dish as a whole wasn't enough to make me full lol. I wouldn't recommend getting this.",

    "text": "\"Eat Rice, Drink Tea, Slurp Noodles, Stay Asian\"  Plagiarized (hey it's all the rage), from Vegas yelper and Asian food guru Tony T; visions of Shang Artisan Noodle come dancing in.  Two things to remember; (1) hand pulled noodles and (2) knife cut noodles.  Both very good, with well developed gluten, very toothsome, studded with surface imperfections that grip hold of broths and sauces making them slurpably delicious.   Better still, they are made in front of you in the fishbowl kitchen to order.  Good food and a show all in one.  Ordering simple.  Select a noodle (hand pulled, knife shaved, or plain machine made zzzz), select a soup or sauce base.  Done.  For soup bases, the Shang beef noodle, beefy with a strong anise and earthy spice flavors.  Not too heavily extracted (some gelatin but not lip coating). Generous portion of well braised brisket.   The pork belly, a gently sweetened pork and chicken broth with light extraction (no silky collagen), hints of earthy soy, good mixed Asian spice punch, with tender, not too fatty braised pork belly.    Sauce noodle dishes, are very strong and border on salty.  Generosity is nice but... The Dan-Dan noodles (sauteed minced pork and bean sprouts in a spicy, thick soy sauce) packs a flavor punch.  Nice earthy, fermented backbone balancing the heat but just too much sauce.  The spicy chicken sesame cold noodle (shredded chicken breast, mixed veg in a spicy sesame sauce) very flavorful but salty.  An extra order of noodles ($1.50) for both made the flavors much better.  OK  starters.  The pork and cabbage pot sticker well made with a crisp, well fried outer layer and light filling, agreeable.  The spicy wontons, slightly overcooked and too soft.  Not very spicy.    Inexpensive.  All dishes below $9.  Asian service.  No complaints.  In the end, sufficiently authentic dishes for the purist and enough menu diversity to keep the adventurous non Asian foodie happy.",

This time around, we wanted to try something new and Shang Artisan Noodle showed up on yelp when we searched best dumpling and noodles.   From the outside, it looks small and it is indeed a compact space when you walk inside. It's busy for a small restaurant, but once you try the food here; you are definitely missing out. If you order the noodles, make sure to order them \"hand pulled\". Also the beef pancake is good, and watch out because it's very juicy. The water has a strange taste, it tastes like dumpling. Anyone else had the same taste?? Great place for a quick lunch and shall return when we come back to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "It was pretty busy in here when my boyfriend and I came here some nights ago. We were seated right away and then it got even busier. A huge group came in and after that, even more people. The restaurant isn't very big with a small amount of tables and also a bar-like seating area that faces the huge open kitchen. Pretty cool that you can watch them in the kitchen, especially when they pull and twirl the noodles! But I do wish they had a taller glass because there were a ton of kids looking OVER the glass and standing on the bar chairs, talking and spitting all over our food because I've never met a child that doesn't spit when they talk and shout...  After, they figured out the seating and such for the big group our order was finally taken. The cooks were just standing in the kitchen waiting to do something so once our orders were put in they started on it right away and we watched our noodles being hand-pulled. How awesome!!!   I ordered the Chicken and Mushrooms hand-pulled noodle stir-fry and my boyfriend ordered the seafood noodle soup. We also ordered the beef and onion Potstickers and the sliced beef shank.   The pot stickers had a crispy crust attached to them which I've never seen before so I thought that made them a little more special than other Potstickers elsewhere and the added crunch was just wonderful. The sliced beef shank was drizzled in a balsamic vinegar glaze and we just hated it. The meat tasted like it had been in the fridge for 2-3 days and they JUST pulled it out and gave it to us when we ordered it. Is this dish supposed to be ice cold?!?! I'm not sure. I think it is but it was my first time trying it... and never will I again. I literally could only take one bite. Not only was it ice cold but the balsamic drizzle was so bad... it tasted like balsamic flavored nail polish remover.  My chicken and mushrooms noodle stir fry was quite delicious! I loved it. The noodles were so so SOOOO good! They tasted so fresh and perfectly soft and chewy. My boyfriend and I both thought that the seafood noodle soup's broth was rather bland... but after posting this statement about the soup on my Instagram they commented and informed me that that particular soup is supposed have a \"light\" broth and that I should try the beef next time... but IMO, just because it's a light broth doesn't mean it should be a no flavor broth :/",

Other than that, the decor and environment is very nice. All of the employees are friendly and helpful. I wasn't too familiar with the menu and they always offer great suggestions.   I only come here for the noodles, I've tried some appetizers and they were not to my liking. I hear they're popular but it just wasn't good to me. The chicken chow mien is the real winner. I find myself craving that often. The soups are delicious as well. And the broths are full of flavor.   The prices here are great. You can have a fresh, delicious, guilt free meal at a great price. If you're looking to try something new, come here.",

I have had this place on my radar for some time just never gotten around too trying it. Thankfully my cousins come too Vegas couple times year on the same page comes too food and enjoy checking out new places in Vegas. Shout out Lori I, Tracy H. Hanwook H, Mike M, and Carol M.   The whole concept of fresh noodles in ramen or any noodle dish. Hell yay! I was excited about checking out Shang Artisan Noodles. I was not disappointed. The freshness of the noodles can tell not only from the obvious watching the guys in the kitchen (open kitchen) prep them, just looking at them look mouth watering, and once dig in so so SO good. It was our first time. So did our Yelp duties order ton of food for two. We started with the beef pancake and spicy wonton. The beef pancake was pretty solid. I really enjoy the meat filling inside had great flavor and seasoning, The dipping sauce was the perfect compliment to the dish. The spicy wonton. I just thought was ok. It lacked any kind of distinct flavor in my mind. Not even spicy. I would not order it again put it that way.  Our entrees my cousin and I made sure tried both kinds of noodles. I got the hand pulled noodles with my Shang Beef Noodle, my cousin got the knife cut noodle with the Chicken and Mushroom Noodle, and then we shared Shang Fried Rice. I love all three dishes!! I know this will be weird but the Shang Fried Rice stood out the most. It was really filling fried rice. It was hardy with lots of vegetables and bunch of stuff. The seasoning on it was very very tasty and could taste it. The worst is having fried rice bland or nothing in it then just rice. The Shang Fried Rice and am sure any of the other Fried Rices. Winnah! The noodles were just as strong between the knife cut and hand pulled. NO way could go wrong with either one. The Shang Beef Noodle had nice portion of cubes of short rib (maybe not sure) that moist and melted in your mouth. The broth was delicious. The bok choy was cooked perfect. The perfect bowl of hearty, hot, and tasty noodle soup warm ones soul. The same can be said of the Chicken and Mushroom. My cousin let me try some. It not as brothy but the sauce was amazing with the chicken and mushrooms. Bok choy.   The service was five star. The guy was very attentive, friendly, and gave us great recommendations since we were first timers. The interior really like it. It well lit. Open kitchen with bar area so if want watch the guys working them fresh noodles and some entertainment. The spot. It feel modern. The menu is nice simple straight forward. If need more incentive try Shang Artisan Noodles right next door have Very Berry Cafe. Not sure if they serve dessert or not really looking since planned on going next door.",

A bit more meat would be nice but the sauce was balanced  Knife shaved dan dan noodles were very tasty as well.  Everything was made fresh as you get to see them do it from the counter.  The knife shaved wasn't as springy as I normally like and they were unevenly slightly card which means they were cooked unevenly depending on which noodle you got.  The dan dan style here is the dry kind not the soup style but every place has their own style of dan dan and this was pretty good.  It's supposed to be spicy but it really wasn't excessively spicy which I like  The hand drawn noodles were cooked better and had a good springiness in the pork rib broth.  The noodles were cooked evenly but the broth was a bit salty.  Better than most of the noodles places as compared to the Bay Area.  Would definitely come back as it was tasty and fair priced  $10 min for credit card but one dish and an appetizer would easily cover that.",

I had to dump a load of chili oil and paste into my broth to bring out some flavor. The broth was def on the lighter side but the handmade noodles were very good! So chewy. The beef was okay. It could of been more tender!   The beef pancake was honestly not good. There was no flavor at all in the beef or juice. We sadly didn't even finish it.   The spicy wontons were pretty good. Reminded me of my family's homemade ones. Def could be spicier.   Service was great especially at a Chinese restaurant hehe.",

We ordered a spicy wonton, house fried rice, pancakes, beef noodle soup, mushroom chicken noodle, LanZhou noodle soup and celery peanut salad.  It turn out very disappointed.  The spicy wonton have no flavor, the noodle soups were so tasteless. The Lanzhou noodle soup is nothing to compare with the noodleman, also the spicy wonton tasted like something else, I had it at Mr. chopsticks they had the best spicy wonton in town.  The celery and peanut salad is not bad, we all like it after all.    Since the noodleman and mr. chopsticks has their own style, I would say this one is kind of in between but can't compare with those two.  I wish they will do well but I won't be back unless they improve their dishes.   I decide to give one star because we really like the celery salad.",

I know what you Asian noodle purists are thinking - If it doesn't have that scuzzy feel, it can't be authentic and/or good. Well it is.  The star of their menu is their hand-pulled noodles for which they have a full time person making at any given time. It's surprisingly mesmerizing watching the chef pull the noodles. Almost like a circus act. With the noodle dishes, you actually get a choice of three types of noodles, but if this is your first visit, I definitely recommend getting the hand-pulled noodles with whatever you are getting. They are chewy, thick and quite delicious. It tastes very high quality. Our group had a variety of dishes and all of them were exceptional. And the best part is that the price point makes this food an incredible value! Most dishes were under $9! Hard to go wrong here.  Like any other new place, there are some kinks that still need to be ironed out, and I do wish the service was a bit friendlier, but overall, this is a place that I want to frequent quite often. I like it far more than all the ramen places around Vegas.",

I ordered the shang beef noodle (hand pulled noodles), chicken & mushroom rice, beef pancake, and cucumber salad.  I arrived 15 min after my phone order and it was on time and ready to be picked up.  I was blown away by each dish I ordered.  The beef pancake is a must and I wish I ordered 2 orders of 4 instead of 1.  The pictures on yelp don't justify the size and it's actually thicker and juicier inside more thicker than a usual dumpling.   The cucumber salad was also delicious and refreshing.   The shang beef hand pulled noodle soup was off the charts!  I never had better tasting noodles than what I encountered here.    The chicken & mushroom rice was also up there but the rice could have been cooked better.  It seemed a little dry and hard not moist and fluffy from what I was expecting to go with the dish.  Overall, I'll be definitely paying another visit and trying different dishes off the menu.",

I had the Seafood soup (shrimp & squid) with extra noodles which was very good and an order of the cucumber salad which blew my mind! The cucumbers are sliced and then covered in a sesame paste. There's probably other spices in there too- it's delicious. Also had dumplings which were obviously homemade but would have been better with some type of sauce for dipping. You can see the cooks preparing everything in the kitchen including the fresh made noodles. This place was a breath of fresh air after spending a few days on the strip. Quality + Service +Price = 5 stars",

Below is a more thorough review of my experience.  Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly staff. It is not a very big establishment, where they have a small bar area and a few tables. If you can, get a seat at the bar so you have front row seats to them making fresh hand made noodles. We decided to get the Shang Beef Noodle with hand pulled noodles, Chicken Chow Mein with Knife-shaved Noodle, and a side of beef and onion pot sticker.   Our main dishes came out first, since it took a while for them to cook the pot stickers. The Shang Beef was extremely tender and the broth was rich and flavor and was not overly salty, which is easy to do with these types of dishes. The noodles were made and cooked to perfection, being soft but also able to have a good bite to them. For the chow mein, it had fresh and crunchy vegetables and the noodles were cut thin enough that they were able to pick up the flavors of the chicken and vegetables. My only complaint was that the chow mein's chicken did not taste that fresh; but other wise, everything else was amazing. The pot stickers were also cooked perfectly; one side was crunchy, the other was soft, and the meat inside was flavorful and had a nice contrast to it from the crunch it got from the chopped onions.  Honestly, do yourself a favor and try this place out!",

I am blown away by the quality of food here; I didn't think Vegas had it in them for quality Chinese noodles. Also, not going to lie--when I first saw non-Asian chefs behind the glass, my expectations dropped a little. But wow.  I went with two friends on Thursday night. The restaurant is minimalistic and clean. There is a bar area where you can watch the chefs pull/cut the noodles, and I would highly recommend that! Their water is cucumber infused and was a refreshing surprise. Sierra, the waitress, was very welcoming and made us feel right at home.  Between the three of us, we had the Shang Beef Noodle, Pork Belly Noodle, and Beef Shank Noodle. Of the three, the Shang Beef was definitely my favorite. The beef is so so so tender; the broth is so flavorful; and the noodles have just the right bite. Pork Belly Noodle was also great; the broth is similar to the Shang Beef. The Beef Shank Noodle has a clear broth--because of that, it is not as flavorful as the other two; it is tasty in its own way. Initially my knife cut noodles felt a little mushy/overcooked, but they definitely grew on me. In the future, I would order the hand pulled noodles for any soupy dishes.  For quality noodles, the price is just right. I'm going to come back for sure.",

I always get the Shang Beef soup with knife shaved noodles, but the hand pulled noodles are good, too. The knife shaved is just chewier! The ingredients are minimal, yet the flavors are outstanding. For appetizers, I almost always have to get the beef pancake and dumpling. I don't eat pork, so I couldn't try other appetizers but from what I've heard, they're just as good too.  Everything is perfect at Shang. Ingredients are fresh and the service is super friendly. The only thing is the wait, but that's not in their control. Just try to go after lunch or near closing, because when I went on a Thursday around 6 PM - my friend and I waited for an hour for a table. The wait only shows how successful this noodle shop has been and maybe it'll motivate them to expand. Definitely must try Shang!",

Which I had read on yelp as a warning. We only waited 20 min so not bad and we were sat at the bar. Great spot too because we could see all the action. It was actually fun watching them make the noodles. Really cool.  As for food.. Cucumber salad - didnt love the sauce they poured all over it. It was a thick sesame cream sauce, maybe Asl for it on the side.  Spicy wontons - same as other places but there quite a few in there which was a bit of a surprise Beef pancakes- had a bit of soup in them, tastes a lot like dumplings but with a fried outer layer   I tried the seafood noodle soup. No real complaints. It was light and clean (no oily or fatty taste). My son had the beef shank noodle soup which was really good. Broth was full of flavor, but you could see just how much oil was in the soup.   Biggest take away, home made noodles are really tasty. They offer homemade, knife(knife used to cut noodles) and plain (machine made).   Service was great. There were only 2 servers but they were on top of everything. Greeting, seating, taking orders and delivering food. They worked as a team and it was great!",

The pork belly was perfectly cooked - not too salty and the broth complimented it perfectly. I also ordered wontons with it, and the beautiful thing was that they didn't skimp on how many they put in there.  The staff was super friendly and helpful and the prices were just right.

I'm glad they had Sapporo beer for me to try, it paired really nicely with the super spicy noodles. We also tried the Spicy wontons which were amazing as well. Will definately be back to try the beef noodle soup!",

    "text": "Shang Artisan Noodles is one of the better places to get some seriously good Chinese noodle soup and dumplings.  Its a bit off the Strip, but well worth an Uber ride to get here.  We arrived at 10:45 am for the 11 am opening and a line was already forming.  Prices are about half the cost of Strip places like Bellagio Noodles and Caesar's Beijing Noodle 9, but food is twice as good.  Plus, you get authentic flavors and a free show in the open kitchen!  The beef pancakes are seared, little hockey-puck shaped dumplings filled with hot, seasoned and juicy ground meat. Our table loved these!  Eat with caution as scalding hot juices can hit your neighbor.  The spicy wontons are also good - mostly sweet and salty, with very smooth dumpling skin.  They have the Sichuan peppercorn flavors but the heat is manageable.  Pot Stickers were properly seared and crispy on the bottom, almost forming a flower-like presentation.  These were also popular with our group.  Finally the noodle bowls - each ranging from $9-$10 or so.  You get the option of hand pulled, knife cut, or regular noodles.  Not sure why anyone would choose regular - that's like asking for pre-packaged noodles.  The Shang Beef Noodle Soup is a safe choice with chewy noodles, super tender brisket, and still-crispy bok choy.  My mom felt my pork belly noodle soup was superior, since the braised pork belly had just enough richness from the fat and yet was so soft and tender.  My mom's pork rib noodle soup was okay - she felt the meat was on the drier side.  Overall, solid noodle place that's definitely worth an Uber ride.  Our server Ciara was excellent - super efficient and looking after the entire restaurant by herself.  Will definitely come here instead of Bellagio Noodles from now!",

I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the action at the cooking area on the other side of the bar.  I was told I could sit anywhere and the server brought me hot tea not too long after I ordered it.  It was super--a mixture of white and green tea with a very distinctive flavor.  I ordered the Shang beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  While waiting, I did enjoy the show watching the cooks put noodles in their strainers for heating and then adding the noodles to different soup dishes.  I also got the chance to see them start the process.  A large pan of bones with meat was brought out and later, after a wok was heated to a high degree, the bones were but in and braised with the high heat.  The cook had two large spoons to stir the meat.  Very interesting to watch the start of making the broth.  My bowl of soup was brought and it was very good.  The beef flavor was nice and strong.  There were very tender beef cubes in the soup, and it also contained three baby bok choy.  Servie was very good with the server bringing me more hot water for my tea.  I'm really a fan of Shang and I want to go back and try the beef pancakes.  It would have been too much for one person!",

For any dish you order, you have the choice of the long, thin hand-pulled noodles or the thicker, curvier knife-cut noodles. I recommend getting a soup dish with hand-pulled noodles and a knife-cut dry noodle dish and sharing with a friend. We got the pork rib soup with hand-pulled noodles which had amazing flavor, tender noodles, and a soothing broth. The second dish, Zha-Jiang noodles with knife-cut noodles, was a bit disappointing because of the sauce that was used. It seemed like the sauce was solely made from bean paste without anything else being mixed in and it was definitely way too strong of a flavor for the delicate vegetables used in the dish. The knife-cut noodles, however, had a wonderful texture and were actually better than the hand-pulled ones in my opinion. It's definitely worth escaping the over-priced, mediocre food on the strip and coming to this neighborhood for some authentic and inventive food!",

It's 50% noodles, 50% flavor. The broth with the wonton soup was completely bland and watered down. Also ordered the dan dan noodles. Typically, the sauce is very concentrated and full of flavor. With the dan dan noodles I received, besides spice and the overly salty minced pork, it was also bland. Maybe it's because I ordered their not as popular options, but wasn't overall thrilled at the choices I selected.",

They let people wait inside a very small restaurant and when so many people are inside, it becomes very uncomfortable for the people who already get seated. Sometimes people wait inside start hitting people sitting because it's too crowded. They don't wanna wait outside because it's either too cold or too hot.  They should tell people to wait outside until called, or they can have a system of texting them when it's their turn. Food: Dan dan noodles is so spicy but it's really good. Spicy wontons is the best I have ever had.  Parking: hard to find parking past 4PM.  Service: good and fast. The customers pissed me off sometimes.",

Just like a teppanyaki style dinner but not quite. This Chinese noodle cuisine restaurant showcases their art openly with their kitchen free without walls or doors so that we can see the process on how their noodles are made and cooked!! I love their hand-made noodles and thin sliced noodle specialties.   I would definitely recommend their signature \"Shang Beef Noodle\" bowl and all their appetizers. I mean all of them! You have to go for the (beef or pork) potstickers and Spicy wonton. They have a soy based sauce and spicy jam to compliment the orders.  If you think it wasn't enough carbs for you, there are additional toppings/ noodles to add on to your bowl for the minimal price. They have many fried rice style bowls to choose from too but unfortunately I never had the stomach to order more food. I will definitely order some next time like the ________.   I definitely give it a 5 star rating for its trendy stylish decor and for it's hand-made noodles showcase. The spices and flavors are not too strong, but it does balance well with the stomach.",

    "text": "Delicious! I got the Shang beef noodle soup with extra veggies and was soooo happy with my choice! The beef was stewed to the point of melting in my mouth. The hand pulled noodles were springy and chewy with great mouth feel. The veggies were flash boiled but not to the point of being mushy. Everything worked together in a harmonious blend of complimentary flavors and textures. I liked that the soup had a slight kick but not enough to numb my tastebuds into oblivion. The portion size was also extremely generous and filling.   I also got a side of the potstickers which were presented beautifully to look like an upside down giant portabello mushroom. But even though they were homemade, their taste left a bit to be desired. They just weren't that flavorful, even with the soy and vinegar dipping sauce.   Two bowls of noodles, extra bokchoy, and an appetizer of potstickers for a total of $30! That's what I call a great deal!",

    "text": "A friend told us about this little spot and we are glad we went.  All the noodles are \"pulled\" to order and everything is made fresh daily upon order.  The veggies were super fresh and not over cooked in our dishes.  The flavors are well balanced and not to spicy but plenty of spice is available if you wish to add to it.  We ordered the following and enjoyed every item we purchased!  We had a couple of beers... no note needed there... an order of Chicken Chow mein with the knife cut noodles I believe ( ask your server which noodles are best with which dish because ours were perfect!) then an order of the Shang Beef Noodle (which was a HUGE bowl) and definitely a meal in itself.  We had an order of the beef potstickers which were perfectly done, the pork dumplings and they were huge and full of meat! And the chicken mushroom noodle with the pulled noodles.  This was harder to eat as the noodles are huge (very long) but super tasty. And I loved that they used fresh Wood ear mushrooms so the flavor and texture of the mushrooms was divine.  And all that with a hot tea was under $60!  There was plenty of food for 4 and we even left some behind.  This is a great spot to call in and grab your order to go.  The seating is sparse.  I think there were maybe 16 people for the table seating and then the bar had some chairs.  Look at the pictures because that's exactly what it looks like inside.  This is in a little strip mall and I would say a great lunch spot but a super casual dinner is fine too or as I said take out! Also our server was awesome and extremely knowledgeable not only about their food but food in general.  The food was quick and fast and perfect in temperature! All in all great job!!! We will be back for sure!",

You can actually tell when noodles are made fresh by the taste and texture, but I feel like mine had maybe been sitting out for a while. I had it both in the Shang Beef Noodle Soup and the Tomato and Egg Noodle dishes. The beef noodle soup had a strong, aromatic broth with lots of herbs (anise) but the tomato and egg tasted strange. Plus the eggs were overcooked and the tomatoes weren't the best quality so they were still quite tart. This is a smaller restaurant and can get pretty packed during prime meal hours, but dies down pretty quickly after.",

Veggies were fresh and tasty; chicken was a little bland, would've loved a little wok sear. Also tried the wonton soup. Wontons filled with pork, milky type broth.  Well-seasoned, not overly seasoned.  I was looking for a little squeeze of citrus in both dishes.  Must try the housemade chili sauce condiment on the table- great flavor combo, not too spicy.   Mesmerizing to watch the Chinese guy pull the noodles and shave them off the loaf of dough.   Would def try again on another visit.",

It was busy for a Wednesday night but that means the food is good. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, Spicy wontons. I also sampled the mushroom chicken and rice, pot stickers, and the beef pancake. EVERYTHING was amazing! There was nothing negative about our dinner. The staff was very friendly with great customer service. My favorite was the Dan Dan noodles. Now that I am back in Texas I am looking for a noodle house with similar dishes, I know good luck. Amazing food I will try this again next time I am in Las Vegas.",

Started with the beef pancake which is sooo juicy it's insane!! It literally is so juicy it leaks out as you bite into it but the flavor was maybe a touch lacking, it's good but not amazing unlike the potstickers which is fried so smoothly and also super juicy!! It's served in a really cool and interesting configuration where the light fried materials all stick together...you gotta get it!! It's awesome!! Then we the Shang beef noodle soup with the knife shaved wide noodle and then the pulled noodle and both tremendous!! The flavor is so seriously good!! The aroma and taste will shock you...rival any noodle soup locally and in LA!! I was really impressed!!",

The beef pancakes and the pork and cabbage pot stickers are tops as well - both piping hot and bursting with savory juices when you bite into them, the way it should be when you eat Chinese pot stickers. Just be forewarned that you might want to order these right as you sit at your table as it seems to take a good 10-15 minutes for them to cook and serve to you.  The noodle bowls come out pretty fast.  Next time, I gotta try their dan dan noodles.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "This really is just a B- restaurant at its best day. I was lured into it by all the high ratings and ended up disappointed by the high ratings.  I should have left when I walked into a Chinese restaurant without seeing any Chinese customers, don't get me wrong I LOVE American Chinese food: egg fu-yong, general Tsau's chicken etc. but when it comes to this kind of noodle you kinda want the real thing.  I give one start for the modern decoration and one for the waiter's service. If these are important to you, there you have it.  If you are about real good Chinese noodles, search for the next option. I regretted not having their knife cutting noodle, I ordered the hand pulled type, strangely they call it hand pulled because it doesn't taste like that at all. Even those you can get from supermarket taste more like hand pulled noodles than what I had today. I wonder if the knife cutting ones are better?  I ordered the signature Sheng noodle soup. When the noodle came it was not served with a spoon. The right way to eat a noodle soup( Chinese or Japanese alike) is to first taste the soup, the first sip is going to show how good (or not) is the soup base hence how good is the chef. After I asked for the spoon, the two tables next to mine also requested spoons, I see both tables were almost half or 3/4 into their noodles and they didn't know they should sip the soup? How well do you know your noodle?  Well, I feel I was perked too much by the reviews hence was overly disappointed. This is an ok restaurant, just not great like most described, and I will not return.",

    "text": "Beautiful small restaurant.  It was lovely to see the chefs prepare the noodles, stretching them, or slicing them off into the steaming hot water.  We had the beef pancake which was delicious.  It was very similar to a circular flattened beef dumpling, crispy and golden brown on flat top and bottom.  There was a really lovely delicious soupy quality to them so it was best to take a small bite from the side and suck out the delicious hot juices that reside inside.  The chili paste provided at the table had a delicate cinnamon flavor that brought out the flavors of the dumpling.  We saw a table who had gotten the other types of dumplings offered and those looked amazing as well.    I was so excited to try the ramen with all the wonderful flavors that you could smell in the air and the sound of the noodles being slapped around in the background as they were pulled.  We ordered the Beef Shank Ramen and the Pork Belly Ramen, both with pulled noodles.  I must say the Shank wasn't my favorite.  It was bland with little dimension to the broth or meat.  I was hoping for a dark beef broth soup with deep flavor, but instead got a nearly clear broth with a very chewy few pieces of meat.  Retrospectively I would like to have done some additions which they list of their menu.      The Pork Belly Ramen was a different story.  The Belly was roasted so nicely and not oily.  The broth had a more complex and deep flavor to it that complimented the broth perfectly.  Had I just had the pork belly by itself it would have been missing something but the delicate noodles, with the star anise and rich flavor of the broth, and slight bitterness of the bok choy was a lovely.  Very reasonably priced as well.  I again wish we would have done some additions though.       All in all the wait staff was incredibly welcoming and nice.  The prices were very reasonable. The restaurant was clean and fresh looking. But I would have liked some recommendations on additions or some chefs suggestions of additions to go with each bowl of ramen, and wasn't impressed with the Beef Shank Ramen.   It was a great stop and I am very glad we stopped in for lunch.",

First, there is plenty of  parking, second we were lucky that there was no wait, and third, the inside of this restaurant is clean, bright and nicely decorated. The food was all great! Since I went with 3 other people, we all ordered something different so we got to try each other's entrees. We started with the cucumber and peanut sauce dish. This tasted great and they definitely do not skimp on the sauce they pour on the cucumbers. The spicy wontons were also very good. The spiciness does linger, but it's cool because they provide a cucumber flavored water. They have wonderful customer service and continue to fill the water up. I ordered pork belly bowl with knife shaved noodles. The noodles were so good! The pork belly and broth was also good but VERY heavy. I couldn't drink much of the broth but the flavor is absolutely amazing. Maybe I'll order extra noodles next time!",

My husband and I love Asian noodles, pot stickers and steamed dumplings so we consulted Google and found Shang Artisan Noodle. We knew we both wanted the Beef Shang pulled noodle bowls as well as the steamed pork and cabbage dumplings and some pot stickers. Most of the time when you go to an Asian or Chinese restaurant, it's full of guests who aren't Asian/Chinese---that's how you know the food isn't great and it's been Americanized. We were the only non-Asians in the place. To say that the food was awesome doesn't even come close. There was so much food, we couldn't finish everything (which is unusual for my husband and me). Everything was wonderful from the broth, to the beef and the wonderful hand pulled noodles. If I lived in Las Vegas, I'd never eat anywhere else. Our lunch was only a little over $40.00 which we were thrilled about after eating at the Iron Chef's place in the MGM Grand where a Wagyu beef dinner and some duck fried rice for two cost us $465.00! Whatever you've got a taste for, save your money and find a place off the strip-your taste buds and your wallet will thank you.",

It might be counterintuitive to order fried rice at a place known for noodles but they do it right.   I didn't love the shang beef noodle soup. It was good and filling but I think I enjoyed every other item ordered (including the Dan Dan noodles) more than the soup. I even enjoyed all the individual parts of the soup. I just didn't care much for the broth. Hopefully there's another broth more to my liking because this place overall is really good.  I went back and tried the pork belly broth. It is sooo much more flavorful than the beef. If you're not anti pork, go for the pork",

    "text": "Who went in on the noodles. *raises hands* I did!  I gotta say that this establishment came in hot with the fresh noodles. You pick a noodle dish and then you pick your choice of noodles (hand-pulled, knife shaven, plain).  BEEF PANCAKE: Definitely order this. It is so good. Crispy outer shell with the piping hot and juicy beef wonton meat in the center. However, I must WARN YOU on HOW TO CUT IT IN HALF because I learned it the hard way. The inside of the pancake has so much hot juice. So DO NOT slice it like you would if it were a sandwich. Stab the middle of the pancake (yes, like if you were going to shank someone in the penn.), and then cut with the knife still vertical. I did it the other way, and the juice popped right through the wonton shell and headed straight for my sister's eye. The juice was piping hot so the aftermath WAS NOT A GOOD TIME.  Wontons: I mean, you just gotta get the wontons! How do you not!  DAN DAN: I lowkey thought these were like the dan dan noodles with the peanut sauce like the one in Hong Kong. But they are not. However, I'm no expert, but I believe this is the original way of serving dan dan noodles anyway. AGAIN, NOT a professional so I cannot confirm that that is accurate. It is spicy. Like a level 6 spicy but it is so good. I am obsessed and I recommend getting it with the hand-pulled.  BEEF SHANG: This is a restaurant favorite and a GO-TO for a lot of people who visit vs. the beef shank. However, if you've eaten at The Noodle Man. I think it's kind of similar to the beef dish at The Noodle Man also.  PORK BELLY NOODLE: If you love pork belly, I'd choose this over the beef shang. It was actually really good, and the broth was amazing. Opt for the knife shaven noodles with this. It's poppin'.",

The first night we had Shang beef noodle and pork rib noodle both with hand drawn noodles, spicy wonton, and cucumber salad.  The beef noodle soup was just slightly spicy with large pieces of tender beef.  Similarly the pork rib noodle soup had excellent flavor (more of a soy sauce type base) with plenty of pork rib meat on the bone.  The spicy wontons had some kick to them.  The cucumber salad came with a light sesame dressing, which was different than other cucumber salad presentations we've seen.  The cucumber salad portion was huge!  The second night we had shang beef noodle soup (because I'm a creature of habit), Dan Dan noodles, and beef pancakes, but this time we had knife cut noodles.  Honestly, we preferred the texture of the knife cut noodles over the hand drawn noodles.  My girlfriend enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles, which had a good amount of sauce.  The beef pancakes were juicy and flavorful, and reheated nicely back home in Los Angeles. (We were full after the noodles, and could only split one pancake). I can't wait to go back to try the other items on the menu.",

All were delicious, though a little empty in terms of added vegetables and ingredients.  The noodles were exceptional but each dish did not offer much more than the meat and noodle.  The cucumber salad was solid, with a pistachio-like glaze, but not a must order.  The biggest gripe with my meal was that it was significantly unspicy.  Usually at these types of restaurants there's a scale of spice or at leat a chili sauce addition, but neither were served at Shang.  If looking for spice, go elsewhere; f looking for quality, authentic noodle, come here.  The price is exceptional and the speed of receiving the meal was as fast as any restaurant in town.  For under $10 you can be full in under 30 minutes.  This would be a perfect place for a nice lunch in a quick fashion.  I will be back, especially since I want to try to the peking noodle as apparently that is a famous dish at Shang.",

    "text": "We were driving past the other day when my husband noticed the sign for Shang's and randomly decided to Yelp it. Reviews looked good and the place is brand new! And when he said hand-pulled noodles, I was sold. The first time I had such noodles was in Chinatown in NYC. And it was amazing. So today we went back to try it.   When we walked in and got situated, one of the chefs in a big open window started his hand pulling noodle thing. It was great to see how fresh it was! I wondered if he automatically starts pulling noodles because he knows people will order it.  It wasn't so busy but service was great. We got water infused with watermelon and were helped right away.   Firstly, the chef provided us with a dish of pickled cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. He wanted to know I'd it was worth putting on the menu. I really like these types of pickled veggies, and I thought it tasted great! But honestly, I'm not sure if people would order it. Maybe if it was $1-2. But would that be worth it?   We ordered a variety of things and everything tasted great!!  Spicy wonton Beef pancake Cucumber salad Shang's beef soup with hand-pulled noodles Pork belly soup with hand-pulled noodles Dan Dan noodles  The spicy wonton was tasty. And surprisingly, it was hot. I'm used to this dish being cold, but having it hot was delicious!  The beef pancake was yummy too. It's more like a fried dumpling filled with beef than an actual pancake. It had some broth/soup inside like shanghai dumplings. So when we cut them in half to share, we lost all the soup!! :(   The cucumber salad is sliced cucumbers topped with a peanut-y sauce. It needed more flavor to me, so I dipped it into a mixture of the provided soy sauce and chili sauce. So much better!  The beef and pork belly noodle soups taste completely different. The beef is slightly spicy and salty. The pork one is slightly sweet. But both are very savory and taste great!  The Dan Dan noodles are delicious as well. But is not a soupy dish. Slightly sweet as well.   The wonton soup comes with no noodles. Tastes like Chinese seafood soup. Also good.  I can't wait to go back, this place was so good! And its here in Vegas and not somewhere ridiculously far like New York :)",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this restaurant, but my overall experience was not too satisfying. Our server was nice but she was the only server on the shift. Although the restaurant isn't big at all, the place was almost full. We never got water refills or never got checked up on.   I ordered the shang beef noodle. Asked if they can make it spicy and was told to use the sauce on the table. The beef and noodles were really good but the soup itself was not hot at all. The sauce provided on the table did not make the soup much spicy either and slowly dissipated the actual soup flavor. The noodles came out within 5-6 minutes so I wondered how they prepare it since the soup wasn't even hot at all.   I also ordered the beef pancake appetizer. I thought our server forgot the order since it wouldn't come out even after I finished my noodle. I asked our server to check up on it and she told us that it takes awhile so it usually comes out in between your meal. She should've warned us about that when we placed the order because we wanted the pancakes as an appetizer, not as a dessert...   Overall, I would like to come back another time just because my friends had a better experience than me. If my friends didn't recommend it to me and I just happened to step into this restaurant, I wouldn't come back.",

Their noodle soups are rich and hearty.   My last visit I had the pork belly noodle soup and my girlfriend had the beef noodle soup. The meat in both soups were so tender you could separate it with a spoon! I had the knife cut noodles which were chewy and thick. She had the hand pulled noodles which were soft and silky. The broth was warm and comforting and full of flavor.   Each and every bite makes you feel warm inside, like you're being wrapped in a blanket of noodle soup goodness.   Anyway, before I get too carried away; eat all of the noodles, it's worth it.",

You can see them making the noodle fresh through the glass while sitting at the counter facing the cooking area. The noodle was well made and can't complain on freshness as you see them making it. The beef noodle soup was good. Beef was tender. The broth was full of flavor. Spicy Wonton was good. A bit flavoring than most places that just drown it in red vinegar and chili.  Overall good place with fair price. Small place so during rush time might be a wait.",

They offer two different types of seating: noodle bar (where you can see the chefs make the ramen, fresh every day) or regular 4 tops. The restaurant is fairly small so if you catch them on a busy day the wait time fluctuates from 15-20 to 35-40 (depending on the number of people in your party of course).  I've never tried anything another than their Shang's beef noodle, it got me hooked from the beginning. Love the tenderness of the beef and the flavor of the broth. You're given three options for your noodle type: hand pulled (long and thin), knife shave (thick and chewy) or plain (kinda like angel hair spaghetti). I've tried all three and the hand pulled are my favorite, it goes great with everything. The knife shave can be too thick, to where it can fill you up really fast.  My boyfriend and I come here often since it's right across the street from work and we couldn't be anymore grateful haha.",

    "text": "Oh yeah, color me happy!  GF and I had late lunch there yesterday and it was sweet from start to finish. Bright, contemporary interior was very welcoming. Typical of most noodle shops, it's a smallish location with seating for maybe 20-25 diners, but if it's filled, there are always takeout options. Server took our drink orders right away and brought back our hot tea (the real stuff with roasted rice in it, in a tea bag steeped in a clear glass mug on a cork coaster--you get the idea, not your typical tiny tea cup with tea pot) and cucumber-infused iced water. I do appreciate a pretty presentation at a meal and they did it right on all items, with flavor to savor.  GF read reviews that recommended appetizers, so we ordered beef pancakes and pork and cabbage pot stickers. Our server cautioned us about biting into the beef pancakes (which actually look like a hockey-puck shaped dumpling, browned on both sides) which might squirt some cooking liquid and he brought a knife to cut into it to be safe. Well, the inner klutz surfaced and I actually dropped my dumpling into the dipping sauce and still managed to make a mess of my blouse. It was good for a laugh while we enjoyed the savory appetizers.   There are three types of noodles to order with your dish and two are freshly made in-house: hand pulled or knife shaved. In fact, if you're facing the cooking station from the counter or east wall, you can watch the noodles being made--huge rope of pasta being swung and twisted. My pork belly soup with the hand-pulled noodles was hugely satisfying, umami-filled dark broth, with generous amounts of braised pork belly and baby bok choy. My friend's seafood soup had a clear broth and was anointed with good portions of shrimp, calamari rings, and fishcake. She wasn't able to finish her soup and took the rest to go--much too yummy to leave behind.  Overall pricing is good and competitive (our appetizers averaged $5 - $6 and soups were $8 to $10). I'm bringing hubby and friends here, and will try again for an off-peak time since both parking and seating are limited.",

My kids got the fried rice and chow Mein stir fry. They seemed to enjoy them. I tried the fried rice and it was delicious. Great service, staff was friendly and attentive. Refilled our waters very often. Will definitely come back again when I'm in town.",

I personally like my noodles thinner, especially when they are hand pulled or knife shaved. The broth and beef of the beef noodle are amazing and I'd definitely get that again. The Zha-Jiang noodles were not memorable and I'd try something else before I order this again.   We also got the beef pancakes which were really good. They are piping hot when you get them, so be very careful you don't burn your tongue. The best way to eat them is either to cut them in half, or wait so that you can slurp up the soup inside the pancake.   There was lots of bar seating available, but the wait for tables were longer on a weekday night. They also have takeout if you don't want to eat there. Would definitely come back for some beef noodle soup!",

I was expecting something like Sriracha or Hot Cheetos, but it's much closer to the instant Korean Spicy Ramen if anything... still very good though!! I love the flavor of it and the meat is soft.   A lot of my family members got the Shaing Beef (?) noodles and thought it was only okay, saying it reminded them of Vietnamese Bo Kho.   Most of my family preferred the hand pulled noodles over the knife cut, but I preferred the knife cut, mostly because I like thicker cut noodles. I didn't notice that the knife cut noodles are a lot chewier though.",

    "text": "Okay let me gather my thoughts and get me head right... This is by far the best Asian noodle spot I have EVER been to, and maybe the best Asian restaurant I have ever been to. It is small so expect a wait. I was there last night on a Sunday after 8PM and it was full. They are fast and friendly. Okay let's get down to the nitty gritty  the food. I had the spicy wontons, the beef pancakes, and the Dan dan noodles. All were amazing!! Everything is homemade every noodle! Wontons handmade nice thin skin with great filling. They are tossed in a spicy vinegary soy. The beef pancakes were incredible. I don't have anything to compare them to because they were so unique to me. My server warned me that they were extremely hot and very juicy. Shy was right almost like a soup dumpling one bite and the the amazing broth or juice or nectar from the gods exploded!!! Hey, maybe be the star of the show, but so hard for me to pick a winner on this meal. The Dan dan noodles were out of this world. You can just tell when you are eating a homemade hand pulled (right in front of you quite the cool show) noodle. Spicy but not over the top. I have never eaten at a Michelin stared restaurant yet, but it would not surprise me if this spot does not earn a one star in the future. LoL remember you heard it hear first. Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and go here when you are in Las Vegas. How did I find this spot?? Yelp of course yelppers won't let you down. My rule 4+ stars with lots of reviews and you will be good-to-go!!",

    "text": "Shang Artisan Noodle did not disappoint. I've been on a Chinese noodle soup kick after being totally burned out on ramen. The space is small with a sign in list for when there's a wait. We sat at the bar where you can view the noodles being made and the appetizers being prepped.   We ordered a couple of Asahi beers (only bottled beers here... shame) along with the cucumber salad, beef pancake and spicy wontons. My boyfriend got the Pork Rib Noodle with hand pulled noodles and I opted for the Shang Beef Noodle with knife shaved noodles. The noodles came out first, followed by the cucumber salad, wontons, and beef pancake. Perhaps order any starters first before ordering your noodles to not get overwhelmed with food all at the same time.   The cucumber salad was a boat load of cucmber sticks with a slightly spicy peanutty dressing layered on top. Mix it up to make sure you don't use all your dressing on the top layer only. I appreciated having a crunchy, fresh dish along with the heavier noodles, though the cold cucumbers after a bite of soup made my teeth quite sensitive. The spicy wontons were as good as they look. They give you a lot of wontons and I like that they have a smaller filling so that they're easier to eat. I wasn't that big of a fan of the beef pancake. As soon as you cut one open the packed filling kind of falls out and the harder outside made the dish disconnected.   The soups though.. they're so good. My boyfriend's pork rib broth was unreal. Very umami with hints of soy and pork bone. My Shang beef noodle was comparatively more oily with a bit more spice (you can also add chili paste as a condiment at the table). They give you a ton of meat and the pieces weren't overly fatty. This is majorly comforting noodle soup. Very clean, very simple but amazing broth and noodles. The knife shaved was more uneven than probably most people are used to but were short enough to not feel like you're eating a giant glob of noodles in every bite. I look forward to coming to Shang more often in my transition away from ramen.",

We came in and were quickly seated. We were so amazed with the fresh noodle pull in front of us that we took some time to order - the staff was so patient with us letting us record their noodle making. We finally ordered and ended up getting the beef pancakes, Peking and wonton soup, Dandan noodles, Shang beef noodle soup, and chicken chow mein.   The consistency of the noodle had such an amazing bite and the flavor was on point. Perfect amount of seasonings so it was not overpowering. The beef pancakes were so crispy and delicious!

Well the staff was really nice and work really hard. There was a table of 3 that came in smelling of booze and came in and when one of the ladies sat down she knocked down they soy sauce bottle and made a huge mess..... i hope that table tipped well because that waiter was way too patient and nice to them.",

    "text": "I like to brag that my mom is a Taiwanese beef noodle soup expert so I'm always down to try a bowl of beef noodle soup when I've heard good things. This is what I look for in a solid beef noodle soup:  1. Flavorful but not overly salty or fatty broth - check! 2. Generous portion of soft, tender braised beef - check! 3. Hand-made, fresh, chewy noodles - check! (If you like a thicker noodle, get the knife cut) 4. Vegetables - I love pickled mustard greens in my beef noodle soup which is Taiwanese style so I wasn't surprised Shang's didn't have it. But they did serve a generous portion of bok choy which I appreciated very much so - check!   I also ordered the beef pies which come in 4 small portions. Mix the chili and soy sauce on the table for dipping and beware of the juicy inside when biting! I really liked the small portion of the beef pies -- makes portion control easier since it can get a little heavy on the tummy.  Overall, it was a solid meal with no disappointment. The price is very fair and I would definitely consider making the trip here instead of going to Noodle Asia on the strip.",

Noodles were amazing and made right in front of you. The chow mein was closest I found to my beloved California Chef Chu experience. The house made chili oil was so good. This place is authentic and I loved the spicy wonton--wasn't too spicy at all. Must go here--but be warned the place is small so may be a line but service when we went was good so was worth it. Also worthy to note water has cucumber and lemon so if have any allergies beware but we loved water, noodles and everything! Will be back!",

    "text": "Would highly recommend Shang Artisan Noodle - really good food at very reasonable prices. Be sure to arrive a little before they open - this place is really popular so expect to wait if you come later. We ordered a couple of different dishes;  the Shang beef noodles, Chicken Chow Mein, Spicy Wonton side dish. They make the noodles in house and you can select the type of noodles (either hand pulled or knife shopped I believe). The Shang Beef Noodles were really good - the broth was flavorful and the beef was very tender. I'd also highly recommend the Chicken Chow Mein - it had a lot of wok flavor. The spicy wonton appetizer was my least favorite dish - it was a little on the oily side, but the noodle dishes are the star of the show. This place is definitely worth the 10-15 min drive off the strip if you want to get your noodle on at a reasonable price.",

There was a slight wait on Saturday night, about 20 minutes for a party at five. We ended up sitting at the bar area which was a pretty cool experience since you get to watch the cooks make the noddles.   I ordered the Shang beef noddle which was very yummy, in addition to a plate of potstickers. The beef noodle broth was excellent and very flavorful. The potstickers were spot on as well and tasted very fresh. I recommend using soy sauce with them.",

Staying on the LV strip without a car, lyfting off the strip is not worth it if the food is just mediocre.  My wife wanted to try something new, I myself am ok with eating at Noodle Asia since we always stay at the Venetian. The price at Noodle Asia is around $15 per bowl of noodle soup, however, you don't have to pay $20 for a round trip Lyft.  It's worth the money and we will be heading back here for sure, on every Vegas trip.  I got the ShangHai Beef Noodle soup and wife got pork rib noodle soup.  Broth was phenomenal and the noodles are fresh fresh fresh. They make their noodles on the spot and you can record it to show your friends.  We order beef pancakes for appetizers.  Just think of it as a prom dumpling but circular and fried. It was so good bc the juices were gushing everywhere.   Make sure to add the chili oil to give your meals a special kick",

The spicy wontons were by far the best wontons I've tried. I could just order those and a bowl of rice next time and be completely satisfied. Now we love beef pancakes but I gotta say the noodle man had better pancakes. But they don't have dan dan noodles and I love saucy noodles!",

They are perfectly seasoned and the noodles are perfectly chewy and fresh. We also got the beef pancakes ($6.95) which were juicy and delicious but sort of small and not what we expected.  I thought the knife cut would be short and fat but they're actually long, slightly thin, and flat. Service was impeccable, we were super thirsty in the Vegas heat and they must have come by about 6 times to fill our cups up. I want to try everything here!!!  Off strip place in a residential area, great prices, easy plaza parking (even though we ubered).",

It was interesting because their Shang Beef noodle soup was a mixture of chicken and beef broth. I wasn't quite used to it but it was unique.  Their spicy wontons sure do have that spicy kick embedded into the meat. It's flavorful and the wrapper itself doesnt fall apart on you.  We also ordered the beef pancakes. If you can imagine soup dumplings but in a beef pancake form. I would say this is a must order for how unique it is. As soon as you take a bite into the beef pancake, the broth and juices race out to give you that rich taste, but also the pancake itself is crisp.",

    "text": "I waited over an hour to eat here. You would think that a hot bowl of soup would be the last thing anyone would want to eat in 104 degree F weather. So that already says a lot about Shang Artisan Noodle. It's worth the wait. Thankfully, there was a boba store next door, so the wait wasn't too bad.  The service was also top notch. They will actually come into the boba store to check if you are waiting in there. The staff working inside the restaurant were also friendly and swift with their service. Here's what we ordered:  Things to note-- You can order either hand pulled or knife shaved noodles. They also have a list of topping add-ons for your noodles.  *Shang beef noodle - Everything you could ever ask for in a bowl of beef noodle. Add a little bit of the chili oil sauce (satay?) for some more heat and depth. I ordered this with the knife shaved noodles and the texture was PERRRRF. It was full with a touch of chewiness.  *Chicken and mushroom noodle - A non-soup noodle bowl with wood ear mushroom. This and the Shang beef noodle were the favorites. It was slurpy even though there was no broth. So much umami in this bowl of noodles I can't even explain it. A must try.  *Dan dan noodles - Probably the least popular, but not bad. Just not as good as the others.   *Beef shank noodle - A clear broth with juicy pieces of beef shank. Completely different from the Shang beef noodle so don't get it twisted. I was surprised at the depth of flavor of the broth,  *Spicy wonton - You can't go wrong with this dish. Spicy, vinegary, savory, juicy.   *Cucumber salad with sesame sauce - We devoured this. At first I was kind of put off by the visual of the sauce, but it went complimented the cucumbers. Very refreshing yet umami at the same time.  *Beef pancake - yummy, but they were popped so the juices escaped :( but still tasty.  Overall, I must say that Shang Artisan Noodles was way better than any of the noodle joints on the strip. GOGOGO!",

We ordered the Shang beef noodle with hand pulled noodles and the dan dan noodles.  Both were very good, however the beef noodle broth was a bit on the salty side.  The dan dan noodles are delicious but pretty spicy.  I also ordered a side of the boiled pork and cabbage dumplings which were very good.  The kitchen is open to the dining area so you can see the guys making the noodles.  The restaurant is on the smaller side so there can be a bit of a wait of during peak hours.  2019 - 17/50",

The service is excellent! The decorations of the restaurant is nice and bright, made me feel like I was back home at LA. We ordered the shang beef noodles, dan-dan noodles and Yangzhou fried rice. Even my picky parents approved their food! The shang beef noodles have a rich taste, the beef soup was just so good! The however,  the dan-dan noodles was a bit too spicy due to the Sichuan pepper. I mean, it was Sichuan level so.... the waitress suggested us to have the sauce separated next time we order that. 100% recommended!",

    "text": "This place is a dream. My sister and I were in Las Vegas for 24 hours. Staying at the Palms, we wanted to find a place nearby to eat. Nothing is more comforting than a bowl of noodle soup after countless hours of travel. We made it a point to arrive right with the doors opened because we knew it was a small space. We were immediately seated and offered water. Guys, this water is infused. Lemon? Cucumber? BOTH? It feels so luxurious to be drinking \"fancy water\" (what I call infused water) or \"spa water\" (what my sister calls it).   The service is phenomenal. Polite and helpful, even offering us a suggestion on where to find dessert close by. After we put in our order, this noodle magician starts twirling the dough in front of us. It was amazing. We started with Spicy Wontons, YUM!! It's soaked in a sweet soy sauce with a hint of heat. The beef pancakes were also delicious. I think it should come with a dipping sauce that is vinegar forward with slices of ginger. The pancakes were mild in flavor, great texture, but I found that I wanted to dip it into something... so I used the Spicy Wonton sauce.   We got the Shang Beef Soup with hand-pulled noodles and Pork Belly with shaved noodles. Shang Beef Soup is everything. It's a more mild flavor that builds as you eat. It's not doused in salt, either, so you really get the flavors of beef. The brisket is so tender while the bok choy is soft and crisp. It's the perfect combination. Pork Belly is a completely different assault of flavors. It's dense and sweeter. The shaved noodles are so cool, thinner on the outside and chewy toward the center, cooked perfectly al dente. This soup was so good, too, but I prefer the Shang Beef.  I don't think there's a bad decision here. I would probably go back once a week if I lived there. Right before we left, my sister wanted to buy one of the wooden spoons because it quite literally is the most perfect soup spoon, just the right size (height and weight) and ergonomically designed. Thanks for the most amazing experience, leaving us happy and satisfied.",

The dishes do not disappoint.  Ever had a noodle just melt in your mouth? That happens here. The rich beefy flavor of the broth and the amazing noodles....that's it! That's all you need in life!   The fried rice didn't need soy sauce or anything extra. Awesome Asian taste with pieces of egg and baby shrimp.  Matching the soup and the rice is a match made in Asian heaven.",

We just stumbled upon this place on Yelp and was actually decently surprised at how authentic and good this place was!  I also loveee that they hand pull the noodles right in front of you.   What we ordered:  beef noodle soup: this tasted pretty authentic for me! I'm usually on the hunt for good beef noodle soup and it never hits the spot so I was definitely surprised and how much I enjoyed this dish! The soup was super flavorful and the meat was tender. The hand pulled noodles was also a great addition to this dish! dan dan noodles: one of my all time fav dishes! I'm usually use to dan dan noodles that has more of a creamy peanut sauce but this was definitely a nice change spicy wontons: these wontons weren't spicy enough for me but I loveee the flavor of it! I just added their spicy sauce (which wasn't spicy as well) but I loved the over mix of texture it gave! I also like how the wontons were a lot smaller than most places so you get way more pieces! beef pancake: this was good but I was thinking beef rolls when ordering this.   All in all, I HIGHLY recommend Shang Artisan Noodle. Will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas. :)",

The beef pancake came as 4 pieces, which is a decently sized appetizer. I would recommend that you must be careful when taking a bite into the beef pancake, as it is a tad juicy - similar to a soup dumpling - but not as soft/wet. The hand pulled noodles were AMAZING. The noodles were the perfect chewy texture and had a nice doughy flavor. You get to see the chef pull the noodles right in front of you.    There seems to be limited seating - but the wait was not too bad.",

But that's how you know a place is good.  I get the beef shank hand pulled noodles every time I go and I love it. If you want something you can eat more easily, I would recommend the knife shaved noodles. But I feel like hand pulled noodles are more authentic. It comes with a generous portion of meat and soup. You can see the chef making the hand pulled noodles by the window, and you know how fresh you get it :)   The order is really fast. The staff is nice and I like the customer service I get every time I go. All in all, I would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes noodles :)",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place, however, there were a few things that were disagreeable and made the entire experience only worth 3-stars in my mind.  First of all, service was excellent.  Service and quick, and accurate.  The broth and beef that was served with the Shang Beef Noodle Soup was excellent.  The broth was rich and flavorful, the beef was tender and tasty.  Also, the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The portion size is also quite substantial.  It might just be me, however, when you get served a bowl of noodles, I am of the mindset that it should be steaming hot.  My soup as served lukewarm... Yes, I could have complained, however, I kinda feel this is a quality control issue.  From the name of the restaurant, I assume the noodles would be the highlight.  I ordered the hand-pulled noodles.  For me, the noodles were not quite the right texture/density.  They seemed rather light, and had little to no chew to it.  I would almost compare it to a thicker canned chicken noodle soup noodle.  Another thing I look forward to was the chili sauce.  At most asian restaurants, I would say it is a very important additive.  To me their sauce was bland, and very heavy-handed on the cinnamon/clove/anise flavoring.  It just didn't quite have the heat, saltiness or umami flavor that most other chili sauces have.    I also believe they flavor the water with cucumber (at least I hope it was)... While not a big deal, I did not enjoy it at all, and would have preferred plain tap water.",

The inside is pretty small maybe 6 tables and seating at the widow where you can Watch the cook make the noodles and that's maybe 10 chairs, so if you come with a big group Expect to wait a while. Service was good here and the food is good. The last time I was here i ordered the Shang beef noodle and it was delicious the braised beef brisket was really flavorful and the hang pulled noodles where really good. like I said I eat at 3 hand pulled noodle places and this one is my favorite.

My husband and I came here in the morning and it was busy so we waited for 30 minutes for a table. The wait was well worth it because it lived up to its name.   I had the pork belly hand pulled noodle while my husband had the beef. We also ordered the spicy wonton. The spicy wonton was really good though not enough spicy but definitely the flavor was there.  The beef from the beef noodle was so tender but for my pork belly it was a bit tough. Though the pork belly was tough, the broth and noodle was amazing. The noodle was just cooked right and fresh. You can tell a difference between fresh made noodles and package noodles and let me say that these noodles taste far from package.   We paid less than 30 for our meal but so worth the 30 for such delicious and flavorful food. My husband said I bounce back from the disappointing dinner we had the night before.   Definitely go here if you want some epic noodle for an epic price!!",

So when i went to Vegas at the end of August we happened to find Shang Artisan Noodle while looking on yelp. We both wanted noodles so we figured why not go check it out. There was a little bit of a wait since there was a large party waiting ahead of us. The restaurant its self is pretty small a few tables as well as bar seating which gives you a few of all the noodle making.  With us waiting we where able to check out the menu and knew what we would want as soon as we sat down.  I ordered the beef with the hand made noodles, and my husband got the pork belly noodles, beef pancake, and beef and onion boiled dumplings. Everything came out super fast and fresh, everything tasted more then amazing.  The pork belly was super tender and almost melted in your mouth and the beef in my soup was super flavorful. The noodles are some of the best I have ever had. Both the beef pancake and the dumplings are well worth it. I will defiantly be back on one of my next Vegas trips!!!",

I had the Pork Belly noodles hand pulled and it tastes very fresh and rich in flavor. The broth is strong but tastes great. Not watered down or overly salty. My boyfriend ordered Shang Fried rice and this fried rice stole the show.  Their Shang Fried rice is steamed rice and it tastes delightfully caramelized, with chock full of tasty tidbits of eggs, minced pork, preserved bean sprouts, and veggies.  My parents shared the Seafood noodles and it was a little bland for me. We also tried the Sliced Beef shank with balsamic sauce and the beef tasted of good quality.  The pricing was surprisingly good.   Overall, a nice dining experience. Oh and you can watch the chefs make the noodles. Sit at the bar for a show while you eat!",

If I've had to wait, it has only been for no more than 10-15 minutes. Their beef pancake isn't something that is offered everywhere and is reminiscent of what I have had growing up. Though they do exaggerate how juicy it is. Not that it isn't but I've had beef pancakes with much thinner skin and far juicier. Dumplings are solid. Overall I will continue to return again.",

    "text": "I really really wanted to like Shang's but they are just missing....something. All of the dishes lacked flavor and I had to keep on reaching for the hot sauce (not that hot) and vinegar at an alarming rate.   Spicy wonton - Not spicy at all, quite bland and watered down to be honest. Their sauce was not thick and tangy compared to other  I've had in my lifetime.   Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles - Also bland, but I think it is just the variety of beef noodle soup. I prefer a Taiwanese version with pickled mustard greens and a richer deeper broth.  This just wasn't it.   Dan dan noodles - This was not a peanut based sauce and was more like a Zha Jiang mian. I tried a bite and thought it was actually very flavorful but I'm not sure if I'd feel the same after a whole bowl.   A stand out item was their beef pancake which was carefully made in front of our eyes. We watched the gentleman roll out the dough and wrap the pancakes with precision made to order. The filling was hot, juicy, and savory.   The waitresses overall were very sweet although you could tell they were a bit understaffed for the evening. Noodles were fresh and constantly being made which looked exhausting. But the noodles are just a vessel and without the right sauce/soup and ingredients they just don't mean anything :(",

As we sat at the bar, we watched the chefs slicing the knife cut noodles and twirling the band pulled noodles.   We ordered and within less than 2 minutes, our food arrived! This was the quickest service i have ever  seen. Our female waitress was phenomenal- she was very quick and friendly and always attending to our needs. She ran the whole show at the restaurant! But besides the superb service, our food was heavenly.   Our Egg and Tomato noodle was incredibly tasty. The tomatoes were sweet, tangy, and soft and complimented the medley of cooked eggs and hand pulled noodles.  We also ordered the Beef Shang Noodle- a favorite here for good reason. I recommend ordering the knife sliced noodles with this one and ordering an extra side of noodles because you will probably need it considering how tasty this dish is and the noodles may be on the lighter side depending on your hunger. The soup was very flavorful and the beef was very hearty.   I highly recommend this place for an intimate or small gathering. If you have a large group, it is more difficult to get seating due to the small size of the restaurant. The food is super tasty and the service is top notch.",

    "text": "Never having Chinese noodle soup before, I wasn't really sure what to expect. We sat at the bar and watched a gentleman, on the other side of the glass, pull and twirl strands of uncooked noodles before our eyes. And I enjoyed every minute of it- dinner and a show? SCORE. THE SERVICE. The server was nice and knowledgeable and described each dish perfectly. There were no surprises for us when we got our food. And she did not lead us astray. They were also quick refilling our waters (it's the little things that count.) So onto what's even more important. THE FOOD. We ordered spicy wonton and I'm sensitive to spiciness but if you avoid the hot chili oil, it wasn't that bad. But if you like the spice than dipping and rolling it around in the hot oil would satisfy your taste buds. The wontons are smaller in size than what I'm used to and I ended up pouring a little soy sauce on them. The flavors were good and all, however, I probably wouldn't order that appetizer again. For our main course, we ordered Shang beef noodle soup with the thin hand pulled noodles (naturally, wanted to try what the noodle artist had been working so hard on making- but you have different options, the one we ordered is similar to spaghetti in shape/thickness but there's a flatter noodle choice as well.) Anyway, this soup is what I would come back for. The broth, texture of noodle and the braised beef brisket were YUM. The thought of its dark broth and bok choy are making my mouth water as I'm recollect and write this review. Honestly. You just have to try it for yourself.",

    "text": "Shang Artisan is a traditional Chinese hand made noodle restaurant. Let me start by saying this place is good and fairly priced in case you don't want to read the rest of my review. The restaurant is very small and can only hold roughly around 20 people (I'm guessing) at a time. I came for dinner and beat a huge wave of people. I was able to be seated and finish dinner and still saw the same group waiting. The menu is limited with a few appetizers and 3 types of noodles. Everyone at my table got the hand pulled noodles but I want to come back and try the other two. I got the Shang Beef Noodle with extra noodles. The broth was delicious and the noodles were very good. My friend got a wet noodle plate and was told it wasn't as good as the Shang Beef. My biggest complaint was the main dishes were brought out way before the appetizers were. By the time the appetizers came, we were all way too full to enjoy them. We got the beef pancake and wontons, both were mediocre for me. Overall, nice little restaurant with big taste at an affordable price. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Located adjacent to Yonaka, this little strip mall is shaping up to be quite a devastating one-two Asian foodie combo sandwiched between the frenetic Vegas Strip and the daunting gauntlet of Spring Mountain for the uninitiated tourist.    Like its Japanese counterpart (Yonaka), Shang possesses a clean minimalist interior with a modern reboot in terms of taste and presentation of classically inspired dishes, although the latter bears a more staunch adherence to old school principles and tradition.  As a prelude to the meal, I highly recommend requesting a seat at the bar, where one is treated to watching the staff stretch and pull noodles, as well as witness the art of knife-shaved noodles deftly flicked into a boiling cauldron of water.  On the day I frequented the restaurant, I had the added enjoyment of watching a young apprentice in action under the steel-eyed gaze of the master (much like Pai Mei's cruel tutelage of Beatrix Kiddo in Kill Bill) and while the finished product turned out great, it gave me a greater appreciation of the difference in experience since the young grasshopper was covered nearly head to toe with patches of flour on his black toque/jacket after repeatedly flinging the dough across his body like LeBron James throwing chalk into the air (he'll get there someday).  For starters, the spicy wonton noodles have great flavor soaked up by the chili oil, but I would have preferred a slightly more generous filling and maybe cooking them a tad less so the skin was a tad more al dente.  The beef pancakes are beautifully plated and appear more like Danish pancakes with little pan-fried cylinders of dough encasing ground beef/chives with a scorching pocket of concentrated broth.  Much like a soup dumpling, handle this one with care since one could seriously injure oneself or those around them upon opening its contents.    The main event is obviously the noodles, and one has the choice of selecting three types of noodles (hand pulled, knife-shaved, and plain) and choice of various noodle soups and sauced noodles.  Our party of four sampled 2 soup noodles (pork belly, pork rib) and and 2 sauce noodles (dan dan noodles, cold sesame noodles).  Overall the noodles have good chew and absorb/adhere flavors from the broth/sauce fairly well although my one complaint is that the predominant flavor that stands out is salty.  A good Asian broth/sauce carries undertones of spice, acidity, and an occasional afternote of sweetness or umami and I just felt like the salt factor overpowered and distracted especially in the sauced dishes whereas the broths did not extract as much spice/bony richness that I know exist in finer renditions.    The julienned vegetables in the cold sesame noodles could also utilize a finer cut and as another yelper suggested, perhaps an extra helping of noodles tempers the imbalance, but that's cheating unless you have the extra stomach space.    All in all, a solid spot for some tasty hand pulled goodness, but at this point cannot place them among the pantheon of world class noodle joints.",

Luckily, we went early enough (11:20AM on a Thursday) that we got seated within 5-10 minutes. As you're waiting, you can watch the chefs make your noodles from scratch. They'll throw it around and twist it and toss it in the air, and it's really entertaining to watch. I'm giving SAN 5 stars because 1. they have great friendly, efficient service 2. the food is so reasonably priced compared to everywhere else in Vegas ($10 for noodles) and 3. the food is SO GOOD. For the table, we ordered a cucumber salad. Unlike other restaurants, their cucumbers are covered with a sesame paste and some spicy oil. It's a little like the traditional Dan Dan noodle flavoring, a little \"peanuty\" a little spicy, but it's deliious and refreshing. I myself ordered the Pork Belly noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles. The hand-pulled noodles are the traditional noodles that are a little thinner like spaghetti, whereas the knife cut noodles are thick and flat and more doughy. I absolutely loved my dish! The broth was so rich and aromatic; a little on the sweet side, but it complimented the tender pork belly so well! As for the noodles, oh my gosh, these are possibly the best noodles I've ever had. They were the literal perfect texture of chewy and doughy and you can taste the dough/yeast flavoring still, and somehow they got it to soak up the broth so perfectly that the noodles are flavored with whatever you order. Overall, I had a great experience at SAN and would highly recommend it to the noodle lover!",

I like to add hot sauce to everything and I didn't need to with my beef noodle. We ordered the spicy wonton and beef pancakes. Those were great the spicy wontons had a very sweet taste even though they were spicy! You have to try them to understand! Also the beef pancakes were so yummy! I also did think the music was very top 40s I didn't feel like it fit at all. I could see some jazz or light hip hop playing but Pink and Country it was pretty funny. Will be coming back for the food which is most important!",

My wife found this place on yelp since we were looking to get something to eat and didn't want to spend a lot of money since we had reservations booked for Joel Rubechon the following day.  We both ordered bowls of the house special beef noodle soup and an order of the meat pancakes.  Now since I live in Irvine, I will say that I have had a lot of good bowls of beef noodle soup and this place was up there on my list as some of the best beef noodle soups out there.  Probably better than even some of the other noodle places in the fancy hotels.  Anyways, its not too far off the strip and also an easy uber or lyft ride that wont set you back too much to the point where you felt like you paid $30 for some noodles.",

The dish came with clear broth and it has SO much flavor! I was very surprised because usually clear broth soup is usually bland, but not this dish! It came w a few slices of beef shank, baby bok chit, and a handful of noodles! Noodles were cooked to perfection! Very soft and chewy!   The spicy wontons, $5.49,are nice addition to your meal, but it is more sweet than spicy. There was like 6 or 8 pcs of wonton (not sure how many) but it was good! They're very small, not your avg sized wontons.   I was very satisfied with my meal!",

It was a perfect bowl of soup although I would have enjoyed more broth just because it was so tasty. There's a True difference to a place like this where the food really is made to order vs other noodles shops that just pump out the food. It even tastes better having been able to watch the chef hand shave the noodles and hand pull the noodles. When you see the work they put into your food, it's hard not to enjoy what they've made for you! I also tried the spicy wontons which were also pretty tasty but be warned, they've got a good kick! I definitely recommend this place especially if you're in the mood for a good authentic bowl of noodle soup!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of noodle, it has such a magical pull on me... especially experiencing one that is freshly made right before our eyes! :)  Ventured to Shang on our recent trip to Vegas as I have heard many happy praises about this place. Situated in a small strip mall, the restaurant is quite intimate aka petite, but is charmingly decorated. We were seated at the counter that surrounds the open kitchen, where you can witness all the actions. So grateful.   Ordered and shared:  * Pork and Cabbage Pot Sticker: This looks utterly tantalizing with the crispy edges around it, taste-wise however was not particularly special.   * Spicy Wonton: Sooo good! Beautiful play of flavor, a burst of savory, spicy (not too spicy) and juicy goodness in each bite. A must order!   * Shang Beef Noodle: This one was my favorite during our visit. I opted for the knife-shaved noodle, thick with springy texture, as for the soup, it was full of flavor, deep and rich. The beef was also unbelievably tender - overall, best beef noodle I've had, anywhere!   * Dan-dan noodle: As for this, we went with the hand-pulled noodle and it didn't disappoint. The noodle has a more delicate texture compared to prior but still chewy and springy. The spiciness level was just right with generous amount of ground pork on top. Delish.   Also, be prepared to wait in lines as this being a popular spot with both locals and tourists. But that aside, the food was superb, the staffs are full of smiles - Highly recommended if you are a noodle fan or just looking for a comforting dish to warm your body and soul.",

Best thing there was the beef pancakes and I think all the fried/ steam dumplings probably pretty decent but I didn't get to try it except the pancakes Place was small but then again I guess it's normal size for Asian noodles place in Vegas. The place was also crowded despite we got there around two hours more before their closing time Service was friendly and he try to be very helpful since it's our first time here  Definitely  know if I would be back for their noodles but wouldn't mind eating the beef pancakes and try out some of those dumplings dishes",

Took a couple coworkers here and they absolutely loved it so have been back twice.  As you can see from other reviews, they offer a variety of chinese dishes but are most famous for either the hand pulled or knife shaved shang noodles.  I've had both and I didn't have a particular preference.  The knife shaved are long and flat and the hand pulled are your classic round skinny noodle.  Had the shang noodle soup both times and loves the amount of meat, taste of the soup and quality of the noodles (I do have to say that I like my noodles a little more al dente then most people but did not tell that to the waiter so that one is one me).  Service here is excellent. Quick, polite, and prompt - everything you would wish for in a restaurant.  Will definitely be back in the future.",

Obviously I had the beef noodles. Well a few times now I just can't stop coming back here.   The beef brisket noodle soup comes in a savory broth with bok choy and a generous helping of soft brisket. Seriously I could eat this weekly.   My husband gets the chicken and mushroom and it is so yummy too. The portion of mushrooms and chicken is generous and the gravy sauce is addictive.   We have also tried the beef pancake a d think they are just okay. A house favorite but too much dough for me.  The beef and onion potstickers though are freaking incredible .   Drink selection solid.  Prices fair.  Service attentive.  Restrooms clean.  Wait never too long.  What is not to love about this place? Seriously I'm thinking about going back right now.",

We decided to try Shang and arrived about an hour before closing on a Thursday night and it was PACKED (there was no way we would have had ample time to sit down at a table and enjoy our meal haha). Discouraged by the long wait, we thought we wouldn't have had the chance to try the hype.   Luckily, after a few days that comprised of $$$ and 3 hour wait buffet (on the strip of course) and decent dinner at a steak restaurant, we arrived at Shang again on our last night in Vegas. As predicted, it was crowded and we waited for over an hour...BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS WORTH.   A waiter kindly and quickly took our order despite how busy their business was. We ordered spicy wonton as appetizer and were surprised by how unexpectedly spicy the sauce was. The main highlight was the beef noodle soup (Perhaps, hands down, the best beef noodle I've ever had). Three of my friends ordered them while I got the dan dan noodle (slight regrets, but I got to eat about half half haha). We all got hand pulled noodles, and the noodle consistency and texture were A+.   Do definitely check out this place because it's well worth your time and money",

    "text": "Arrived: 8:50pm Estimated wait time: 25-30 min  Sat down: 9:12pm  What I ordered: - Beef noodle soup ($9.95) - Dan dan noodle ($8.95). This was so bomb, be sure to order with cut noodles. - Beef pancake ($6.49)  The Establishment: - Really way too small. Maybe six sets of tables and with a noodle bar.  - This means that the 30 min worth of customers waiting are waiting inside the front of the store on a cold day such as this one. But the beauty of it is, they all waited, you know why?  Why you would come here:  - I kid you not. As a Taiwanese born yelper, I attest that this place has the most ahhhhmazing noodles. I don't foresee any future Vegas trips without a pilgrimage to this restaurant. I don't want to hear anything about that wait or that there are other places like buffets to visit, this dining experience was totally worth it.   Why you wouldn't come here:  - You're really hungry and 9pm arrival with a wait time of 30 min really doesn't cut it. But really, suck it up, it's worth it.   Cheers!",

It's a busy spot but worth the wait especially since our server was so nice and attentive! Excited to come back!

While we waited, it was very entertaining watching one of the employees pull a big string of (ramen) dough and shaves them into a big pot of boiling water. I ordered the beef shank Noodle and it was very good! The broth was tasty and not too salty like a lot of Noodle places. The beef was extremely tender. I was however disappointed with the appetizers we got. The beef pancakes were not very good and the dumplings had a very strong alcohol taste to it. Other than that, I will definitely be coming back to try the different noodles.",

Hand pulled noodles and soup sounded to die for.  After we checked out of our hotel, we ubered straight here with luggage and all. The wait staff was nice enough to let us leave our luggage behind the host stand. A real life saver. The inside was super aesthetic and I already knew I would like this place.  Our server was very kind. I asked him what his favorite was and he said the Dan Dan noodles with the knife cut noodles, so I got that! And my boyfriend got the beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. We also got spicy wontons to share. 10 come with the order.  The food came pretty quickly and all if was exactly what we wanted. The beef noodle soup broth was a little too salty to our liking. If there was a slight bit more hot water it would've been perfect! But I love salty so I can overlook that. I loveeeeed my dan dan noodles. It was the perfect amount of spice. I loved it so much I forced myself to eat only half so I can bring the other half to work the next day. The wontons were just the way I liked them so I ordered another to go.  If that doesn't say \"I love this restaurant,\" then I don't know what does.",

    "text": "Shang noodle house did not disappoint. My husband and I came here on a Tuesday around 430pm and there were not many customers yet. We were seated right away and I had a view of the chef making the hand pulled noodles.   The price range here is affordable. Most main dishes were under $10 and appetizers were in the $5-$7 range.   I ordered the Shang Beef Noodle and it was very tasty. It was the kind of broth where you dont need to add anything else for flavor. The noodles were made just right. It wasnt too thick and had a bit of chewiness.. just how I like em.   I also ordered the beef pancakes which tasted ok. There was definitely more meat than pastry and in my preference it was a little too much meat. There was also an odd flavor that I wasn't too fond of. Which knocks the one star.   The service here is great. We were first served by a lady who made sure to check on us a reasonable amount of times. By the end of our meal we had a different server who was also just as attentive and delightful.  The inside of the restaurant had a clean, stylish, minimalistic feel. The wood work on the counter looks great, the wooden spoon for the soup was unique, and the cup for the tea was cute. I would definitely return here to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "Definitely the best restaurant I went to on my trip to Vegas and that is saying a lot.   Shang Artisan Noodle is some of the best Asian food I have had in a very long time. All the flavors, texture, and service were at the height of my expectations during my visit. Fresh prepared noodles in every dish is now going to be the standard for every place I review now.   The very best part of the whole experience was the price. With this much quality and quantity I would have payed double what I payed anywhere else, but Shang Artisan Noodle sets pretty much their whole menu at $10 or lower. I was able to try 4 different entrees for the price of one on the strip.   Our waitress was literally by herself for about 10 tables during the lunch rush and she had no problems taking care of the whole house. It was quite impressive.   If you are a fan of Asian food or noodles/dumplings please give this place a shot because it is super high in my list of places I will go out of my way to eat again in the event I come back to Vegas.",

If you love noodles and soup combinations, this is one place you need to check out. I had the pork belly soup with pulled noodles and my husband and son both had the Shang beef soup with pulled noodles. These were so good and the soup portions were just perfect. We also shared the beef pancakes. We were warned that they are filled with lots of juices so we let them sit for a little bit before digging into them and they were still very juicy.  We would love to go back and try the other soups.  We sure hope you make a new location  in the Henderson area soon!!",

You can either choose from bar seating and see your noodles being made, or a booth, which is designed more for parties that want to eat facing each other!  In terms of the dishes, they have a wide variety but I definitely came in to try their most popular dish: the Shang beef noodle ($9.95) as well as the beef pancakes ($6.49). My party also ordered the dan dan noodles ($8.95) which was also very delicious. They have chili oil on the table so you can always spice it up to your liking!   On a side note, the location is not too far from the strip! So definitely expect a lot of visits from locals and visitors!",

    "text": "Menu looked interesting. I was most intrigued by the fresh pulled noodle technique. Unfortunately, I was busy catching up with an old friend that I didn't get to take a picture of the \"noodle art\" and how it's made. I ordered the Shang noodle soup assuming it was their main dish and original to their restaurant. I didn't think to ask if it was spicy because in the description it was just beef broth, braised beef and vegetables. I know I mentioned I was sharing with my 3 year old because she ordered \"noodles\". When the dish came, the broth looked spicy - so before I went in for a taste - I asked the gal and she responded \"oh no, it's not spicy at all\". Mind you - I'm sharing with a 3yo. So I tried it. I don't like spicy - any kind of spicy. And I think she probably sets spicy at a 5. This could've been a 1 but it was still spicy. What did I miss??   Shang Artisan Noodle, can you explain? What kind of ingredients are in the dish that make it spicy.   So rather than traumatizing my 3yo to see if she likes it, I just requested to order something else. I went safe and ordered shrimp chow mein. For $10+ I did not expect them to throw in tiny frozen shrimp. C'MON NOW?!!!, but it was. Prob smaller than a quarter or at that size.  I explained to our server that even though she mentioned the soup was not spicy, it was too spicy for my 3yo.   My friend told me not to give the soup back because she'll just take it home since they'll prob just throw it away. But I guess they don't care to compensate unhappy guests out of courtesy. The vibe I got was that the servers were just worried about getting people in and getting people out. There was no connection. There was no checking out how people were doing. I don't even think there was any eye connections with the person who took our order and then again the addl order. Did she even hear the reason we were placing another order?   I still have mixed feeling about going back. I was too caught up in my company that I wasn't as upset as I should have been. So walking out of there - I have mixed feelings.   We also ordered the pork and cabbage pot stickers which were ok.   They have clean restrooms. Single stall. 2: one for men and one for women.  Maybe someone can recommend a different dish to try? Or advise me how to order the Shang Noodle Soup less spicy?",

Please keep in mind that I live in Philly and eat hand drawn noodles pretty often in Chinatown there. Therefore I was a bit disappointed by my meal here. I thought everything was a bit bland. The noodles had a good chewiness/texture to it but the whole dish needed more salt or umami flavor and I am someone who usually prefers things to be less salty. The dumpling filling was good but the coating was pretty thick and made it less enjoyable. The cucumbers were probably the best out of the 3.",

On a more serious note, the wait is pretty long (45 min) in the scorching sun and minimally shaded area. The food breakdown: -Shang beef noodle: mildly spicy and standard. The beef was tender and super fatty. The pulled noodles were good.  -Shank beef noodle: a beef and chicken broth that is more lean than the Shang beef noodle. This tastes healthier and lighter for sure.  -beef pancakes: super juicy and hot, but they always took 20 minutes to make.  -potstickers: juicy and crunchy but also took 20 minutes to make. I was too full to enjoy these.   Service was fine. Our water cups were always full thanks to one of the servers!    Not sure if the food is worth waiting 45-60 minutes!",

Their hand pulled noodles are THE BEST. I always get the chicken chow mein. Large portion, so much flavor, chicken, and veggies but they are (just being honest)  greasy.   The Shang fried rice with pork is also great never had fried rice with corn but it's good!   The pork and cabbage potstickers are tasty and beef pancake. Full of flavor and the dipping sauce makes the dishes that much better.   This place is usually always busy so if you plan on dining in have some patience and if you're doing a pick up call ahead and take your time getting there to pick up your food. But worth the wait!",

Not only do the noodles tastes that much better but I've noticed that these places also take more care in making their soups and sauces to complement the noodles. Shang Artisan noodle is no exception.  Shang is a small restaurant that's pretty popular so it can fill up pretty quickly during peak hours, so expect a bit of a wait. Service is pretty quick, so you won't have to wait that long. I love that you can see the chefs making the noodles through the glass wall.   1) Spicy wonton - skin is so thin and the spicy sauce is fantastic. This place reminds me of my favorite spot in Monterey Park for spicy wontons. This is   2) beef pancake - super juicy as you cut into it. Don't bite it because you'll burn yourself and the juices will fly all over the place. I got splash damaged by my neighbor who didn't know. The skin was pretty crispy and thick.   3) Beef Shang Noodle - I opted for the knife cut noodle which is a wider noodle. Gotta get this when it's an option because it's so rare to find. The This topped my favorite beef noodle spot back in LA. The broth was fantastic! Super flavorful yet pretty light, so you don't leave feeling heavy and lethargic.  Service: very respectful, friendly, and efficient.",

    "text": "Popular Las Vegas eatery, serving modern interpretations of traditional Chinese handmade noodles. Located in a strip mall, the interior is casual, with table and bar seating. The open kitchen allows a peek into the process of making noodles from scratch. The menu is concise, including various side dishes, soups, sauce noodles, rice, and chow mein. For any dish with noodles, you may choose between hand pulled, knife shaved, or plain noodles.   I got the Tomato & Egg Noodle with hand pulled noodles, and my boyfriend got the Chicken Sesame Cold Noodle with knife shaved noodles. Both varieties of noodles were good, with fresh glutinous flavor, and the perfect amount of bite. However, the dishes as a whole were pedestrian. The sauces were thin, bland, and watery due to the noodles not being dried properly. The Tomato & Egg noodle sauce just tasted like salt.   The Cucumber Salad, albeit simple, was the star of our meal. The crisp, fresh cucumber spears were evenly drizzled in a richly savory sesame sauce. Service was friendly and fast. I think Shang has serious potential, especially considering the lack of similar restaurants in Vegas, but their recipes desperately need work.",

My parents and I tried their spicy wontons, beef pancake, Shang beef noodle, Dan Dan Noodle and their Wonton Noodle.   I ate the beef noodle soup and I really enjoyed the amounts of beef they provided in the bowl. The noodles were plentiful as well and tasted extremely fresh. I was imagining the beef pancake as the beef rolls, similar to the ones you'd get at Mama Lu's in Alhambra or 101 Noodle Express. They tasted nothing like it and it get more like a fried soup dumpling more than a pancake. The spicy wontons are so small compared to like Din Tai Fung or any place that serves it for that matter. The spice tasted more like Sichuan since I felt a smidge of that numbing feeling you'd normally get from eating g Sichuan food.   This place definitely reminded me of another restaurant in the 626 called Noodle St. I honestly like Noodle St more but it's rare to find knife-cut noodles these days so I'll always order it no matter what. I'll definitely come back to eat more noods because carbs is love.",

They make their noodles in house and be sure to watch the master stretch and pull the batch. Their noodle dishes looked really yummy and you can choose between hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or plain noodles for you dish. We chose to try the spicy wontons, Dan Dan noodles knife shaved style, and the popular Shang beef noodles hand pulled style. The spicy wontons are what they say filled with meat and swimming in a chili oil based sauce, be aware that this is steamed only. The Shang beef noodles were served in a delicious beef broth base with bok choy with super tender pieces of beef brisket and the hand pulled noodles were nice and chewy. The Dan Dan noodles were surprisingly spicy. Like my kind of spicy, but unfortunately to spicy for my bf to eat. The ground meat is served on top with our choice of knife shaved noodles that were wider in form. There isn't much spice if you just ate the dish without stirring it, but we didn't know that and so my bf stirred and mixed the dish ingredients and apparently there was really spicy chili oil and such in the bottom. So be cautious when ordering the Dan Dan noodles if you do not handle spice well. Overall the experience here was awesome and I am definitely coming back.",

However, the last time I was in Vegas 2 months ago, we ventured off to Shang Artisan Noodle based on a recommendation from a friend. MY GOD DID IT HIT THE SPOT!  My friend and I walked in around 2-3pm (after lunch rush). Thankfully the place was half empty so we got seated immediately. We ordered the Cucumber Salad to share (3/5 it was good but I've had better). My friend ordered the Shang Beef Noodle Soup with Hand Pulled Noodles (my friend loved it 5/5), and I ordered the Beef Shank Noodle Soup with Knife Cut Noodles (5/5). I personally preferred mine better because the broth was less heavy than the Shang Beef Soup.  Overall, this place is worth taking an uber off the strip. So much better than that super overpriced asian noodle place inside the Venetian lol.",

Went in around 4pm and by the time I was done (5pm?), there was a line forming outside with a waitlist of probably 4 party.  I didn't like their spicy dumplings as much as their noodles. The dumpling skin was thin, which is good and legit. The seasoning from the chili oil also tasted legit. It was the meat innards that made me disappointed.

I've had many others like it and this is probably one of the freshest I've had.   But honestly, in my Beef Noodle Soup adventures...this place would rank pretty high up there with their Shang Beef Noodles. Small chunks of tender brisket in a hearty, what seems like a tomato based soup, with just the right amount of spice and flavor. I've had a similar bowl of noodles in Taiwan that tasted just like this. I'm glad I've found a place just like it. Just note, the noodle soup is not spicy and if you glance at the whole menu, there's really only two items that has a symbol of chili pepper next to it.  Don't fret because on your table is a small jar of what looks like chili oil. Gives it a boost, but certainly won't knock your socks off.   We got the above dish with the hand knive cut noodles. Great texture and chew. We got the below with the hand-pulled noodles, both are are same price whatever style you choose.   We also tried their pork belly noodle soup. The soup on this dish is not as complex and I thought it just tasted like soy sauce and sugar. (What you normally would coat on Asian pork belly anyways). Again, the hand-pulled noodles are excellent on this (Or probably any soup).  Definitely expect a wait. Our was about 30 minutes and we ended up at the counter with our party of four. Write your name down on the pad and order boba next door and wait on the patio chairs. The inside of this place is small and the parking lot isn't the biggest either. So come early if you can, but I'm sure there will still be a wait.",

I made sure to mix everything well before eating it. I also got the appetizers too. Parking is pretty easy and chinatown is easily accessible when you stay at the hotel on the strip.

    "text": "What an amazing place. There's only seven tables and two long bars to sit here so I understand how the wait can be long at times, but the turnover is really fast! They serve us so fast and so well and the waiters are especially attentive. After a long weekend of drinking, it's great to come here to refresh.   I got the Peking wonton with hand pulled noodles ($1.50 extra) and it was nice and refreshing, not as salty as everything else, more refreshing and with a clearer broth. My boyfriend got the braised pork belly and the pork belly was incredibly tender and the soup was a lot more rich and salty.   All in all, come early because we got there right at 11 and got one of the last tables and by 11:30 it was completely full.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Came here because of their hand pulled noodles.  I was told the Knife shaved noodles were the way to go, basically flat hand made look fun noodles.  Any of the noodle dishes you can can select either hand pulled noodles, knife shaved noodles or plain noodles.  The plain noodles are thinner than the hand pulled and not made in house.  I opted for the Pork rib noodle soup with knife shaved noodles.  The noodles were great, very chewy in a good way but the broth was kinda luke warm and although flavorful, i wish it was more salty, (if that makes any sense).  The pork ribs easily fell off the bone but were still dry, i think because they had not cooled in the braising liquid.  My friend ordered the pork belly noodle soup with knife shaved noodles, they shared the same soup base, which i think is made from the basing liquid of the pork ribs and belly.  We also ordered the beef pancake and spicy wontons.  The wontons were not spicy at all, i'd give them a 2 out of 10 maybe.  They were pretty good but not great.  The beef pancake was not the traditional type I'm used to but rather 4 dumplings fried on the flat top.  The dough was nice and crisp but a bit too thick for my liking, the meat inside is tender and juicy but the ratio of dough to filling is off.  Im told this place can get crowded since it only holds 26 people, but we got there when it opened so there was no problem.  The noodles were great the side dishes and broth could be improved but I'm rounding up to 4 stars because of the hand made noodles.  I'd return to try one of their dry noodle dishes and maybe some other appetizers.",

There are tables to the left and a little bar surrounding the kitchen where you can sit and watch the chefs while you eat.  This is the 2nd time I been here. The last time I had the hand pull noodles.   This time I was inspired by a Instagram post that this place posted of the fried rice.  We got in and were quickly seated. My finacie ordered beefshank soup with handpulled noodles and I ordered the Shang fried rice.   We also ordered the beef pancakes to share. If you go here you must try the beef pancakes at any cost. They are extremely juicy and paired with their housemade sauce...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  When our food came, the server provided us with a extra bowl and plate so that we can share each others food which was very thoughtful.   The total cost of our meal was about $30 and with the amount of food and service you get, it's well worth it.",

Our wait for party of 4 during the lunch rush hour was about 45 minutes. Bigger groups waited longer and by the time we left the wait was 1-1.5 hours.  On normal days they say the wait goes up to 30 minutes during their lunch and dinner rush hours. The noodles come out quick so they move people out quickly. Still there was a lot of people waiting so our wait was longer than normal.   Was it worth the wait? Heck yeah!  It was one of the best Chinese beef noodle soup we have had and we come from the 626 which has many options. The broth flavor was perfect and hand made noodles was a plus.  Pricing for the noodles soups were decent around $8-$10 a bowl. We also ordered pork dumplings and spicy wontons. They were good too...not amazing like the beef noodle soup but just right. This place is worth a try and definitely better than some of the Chinese beef noodle places in the 626.",

I had the spicy wonton and although they are not that spicy, the flavors were amazing. The beef and onion dumplings were juicy and delicious. I had the Beijing zhajiang mian, and it was very good. My boyfriend got the Shang beef noodle and it really tasted like Beijing style beef noodle soup (niuroumian). It transported me back to the soup I used to eat all the time there.   The atmosphere is nice, it's clean, and it's cool to have a different choice of noodles. They were making some noodles while we were there (you can watch them make it) and overall it was a great experience. I am looking forward to trying the dan dan noodles.",

The restaurant is super modern looking, and the chefs are seen making noodles from the window. That afternoon, we had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of four, but the line moved really fast.   When seated, we ordered two Shang beef noodles, with knife cut and hand pulled noodles, pork rib noodles, and pork belly noodles. The beef stew was super tender, and I loved the slightly spicy flavor of the soup. The noodles were chewy, and you could taste the hand-pulled consistency. It was a pretty good serving size, and I couldn't even finish all of my noodles.   We also ordered the beef and onion potstickers and the pork and cabbage potstickers. I preferred the beef potstickers, but both were deliciously crispy and had a layer of crispy dough on the bottom. They provided a sweet and sour-like soy sauce for dipping, which complimented the potstickers well.   I would highly recommend this place if you're in Las Vegas, even though it is a bit of a distance off the strip, but for the reasonable prices and quality of food, I would definitely come back!",

    "text": "Just wanted to give a fair warning and say finding a parking spot close to the restaurant is luck of the draw and you might have to walk a short distance.  There's a sign in sheet when you enter, but I was seated right away as I was solo. I recommend if you're going with a group of friends you keep the party at 4. 5 at the most. You can go with a bigger party then I recommend, but you may end up split as it's a small dining area.   Service was fast and received my food pretty fast. About 10 mins passed and food was served.   I ordered the beef noddle bowl with hand pulled noodles. The bowl also has bok choy and green onions. Lots of flavor with a small kick, but very filling. There's also a soy sauce bottle and a spicy seasoner you can use to add more flavor.   Would definitely eat here again on a cold or rainy day!",

Very nice modern restaurant. It's not really big. Probably seats 20-25 people. We got there right when it opened, so we were the first ones there. Service was great! The waitress gave us great recommendations. She really knew what she was talking about because everything was really good.   We felt like we ordered the entire menu: Cucumber salad Spicy wonton Potsticker Beef pancake Beef brisket noodles soup w/ knife sliced noodles Pork rib noodle soup w/ hand pulled noodles Dan Dan noodles w/ hand pulled noodles Chicken chow mein w/ plain noodles  The only thing we didn't like was the cucumber salad because of the peanut sauce that was on top. The cucumber itself was good, but it was too peanuty. Also, the pork ribs in the noodle soup was not tender to my liking. I like it fall off the bone, but that could just be me.",

My friends and I got the Shang Beef Noodle, along with the Spicy Wonton and we LOVED both dishes.   The Spicy Wontons were a bit oily, but so worth it!! I decided a long time ago that good food over health (which is probably why my doctor always yells at me but oh well). My friend thought that they were a bit too spicy but honestly he thinks that everything is spicy so I wouldn't trust his opinion. They were perfectly delicious, and perfectly spicy. Highly recommend!  The flavors in the soup were delicious - I think something I'm always very concerned about when I get beef broth soups is whether or not the flavors are concentrated enough and if the meat is tender. At this spot, the meat is so soft and tender and the beef broth is just the right flavor. The soup was not too salty and not too bland, and such a delight to drink on a cold winter day.  The noodles were especially wonderful. They were so chewy and light, and they paired perfectly with the light broth.   All in all, I would whole-heartedly recommend coming to this place and trying it out. The prices are great, the customer service is spectacular, and the food is INCREDIBLE",

    "text": "Take a minimalist approach, refined the quality and you've got Shang Artisan Noodles.  I came here in the middle of the afternoon looking for a hearty meal and thanks to my LV buddies Nelson Q., Philip T., Chris V. and Rod U. (HI), I trusted my gut to them and explored this highly sought after venue.    The menu was simple: appetizers, noodle soup, noodle sauce, fried rice and chow mein. But come here for the show stopper - the homemade noodles.  Since I was eating alone, I chose the \"Chicken and Mushroom Noodle\" with knife shaved noodles ($8.49). This bowl was filled with four kinds of earthy mushrooms, shredded chicken and four mini bok choy stalks with a brown gravy mixed into the toppings. Underneath, the knife shaved noodles was a thick and wavy long noodle which had a perfect al dente bite. After a quick mix of the toppings and noodles, it soon became a bowl of unami flavor which I couldn't put my chopsticks down. Each bite had the sauce completely coated onto the noodle which made the experience intoxicating and pleasurable. Be sure to ask for their chili which adds a great kick of spice.  Quick tip: I highly suggest ordering the knife shaved noodles with the \"sauces\" while saving the hand pulled noodles for the soups.   This restaurant is small and has a more contemporary feel. I sat in front of the kitchen as the chef was meticulously folding the dumplings for the dinner crowd. The service was extremely fast and friendly.   I'd love to come back to try their beef pancakes and other noodle dishes! Want to join?",

Shang beef noodle hands down. Hits the spot, right amount of savory. Pork belly noodle was more on the salty side, the broth was not as savory. Beef pancake are okay, be careful when you cut into them, a bit explosive with the juices. Definitely be returning to try the Beef Shank Noodle and the knife shaved noodles. Spicy wonton, not really spicy, more oily. Appetizers came after the entree's but its understandable since the noodles are ready to go!!

    "text": "Came to try this place out after helping.  Given the myriad of choices for Chinese food in the vegas proper, this one looked good on the pics   Ordered the beef noodle soup, beef  pancake , dumplings, and the spicy wonton.  The awesome tasty ones were the beef noodle and the spicy wonton.   Beef noodles flavor was very delicious. Authentic.  And the noodle was freshly made.  Love the chewiness.  Soup flavor was absolutely amazing.  Reminds me of my moms beef noodle soup.   Spicy wonton was awesome. A good spicy without the after taste spicy.  Subtle sweetness was truly savoring.    I thought the beef pancake was ok.  Most beef pancakes contain good amount of soup juice when you bite into it.  The ones here weren't as juicy as expected.  Dumplings had good wraps.  But the stuffing lacked a little sweetness that I had hoped.   Overall it was an impressive experience.  Would definitely be back should we visit LV again. It's a must try for those that crave authentic beef noodles.",

The fresh hand-pulled and shaved noodles had the perfect texture and bite, the broth rich and flavorful with generous servings of tender meats.  Also, tried chicken chow mein, dan-dan, and spicy wonton (not spicy enough for us though).  Friendly and fast service was a plus. Definitely on our list for next trip! Would highly recommend this restaurant.",

They actually showcase themselves hand pull and cutting their noodles it's pretty awesome.   The very first time I came we had a party of 4 and ordered the beef noodle soup, the dan dan noodles and the seafood noodle soup. Of all of them my favorite was the beef noodle soup. They had a really flavorful but not overly salty broth. My dad ordered the knife cut noodles and I got the hand pulled one. I personally prefer the hand pulled noodles because they're thinner and are better at soaking up the broth but if you're into thick cut noodles I'd recommend the knife cut. Back to the soup: their beef is so tender it almost melts in your mouth but it just has enough texture to it. My mom got the dan dan noodles which she said was just okay and my girlfriend tried their seafood soup. She really enjoyed her seafood soup along with all the actual seafood in the soup. They're generous with what they give so order appropriately!",

The beef shank noodle tasted too salty. No, that's not the way to cook it.  On the other hand, the chow mein is lacking taste. The sesame cold noodle had too much vegetable, ratio between noodle and veggie is not right and the peanut sauce is completely lacking. I tried to add some more and it saves the taste a little bit but I still had to force myself eating it.    The beef pancake is actually really good. However, overall from the perspective of an LA Cantonese who is experienced eating good noodle dumpling dishes like this, sorry to say, these were off the mark.",

Decor: An elegant simple and clean. Theme is modern, sleek and bright. I love the wood chopsticks and spoon provided. The water is infused with lemons or cucumbers. The place is not big but kept well. You can see how your noodle is being made from scratch which is the whole attraction itself. You can tell the cook keep clean and organized at all time.   Menu/ingredients: the menu is simple and easy to follow. You can pick and choose what you want off the menu by asking them. Everything is made in house. They have two kind of noodles: hand pulled and knife shaved. My favorite is hand pulled since it's on the softer side. The knife shaved is on the chewy side. Brooth is superb and tasty!   Service: they have good service. Sometimes they have a waiting line but usually it's fast.   Recommendation: would love to see more seats and comfortable seatings since sometimes they are busy and cannot accomodate large parties. Specials of the day would also be a good thing to add to their menu.   Overall, I highly recommens this place. Everything is fresh, clean and authentic!",

    "text": "Growing up having a lot of Northern-style noodles, I went to Shang's Artisan Noodle certainly with expectations. The truth is, nostalgia in the taste palate is hard to surpass, or even match. With that in mind, Shang's northern-style noodles come close to my childhood memories.  I got the knife-shaved Shang beef noodle. What I looked for were tender meat, chewy noodle, and flavorful broth. The meat knocks it out of the park--it was tender, flavorful, and required little effort to chew. The rich flavor gets even more potent when accompanied by a spoonful of the delicious soup. The only thing missing the mark were the knifed-shaved noodles; they were thick and chewy but lacked the beef flavor. I am not an expert but may be the noodles needed to be immersed in the broth a littler longer. Nevertheless, the experience was still a pleasant one.   We also got Pork & Cabbage Boiled Dumpling and Beef pancake. Both were quite good but short of amazing. To me, they tasted a little bland even when dipped in the sauce that is on every table. Also, I think both dishes use the same fillings because the tasted similarly. While each side dish can be a good complement to your noodle soup, you shouldn't get them both at the same time.   The service didn't comply with my childhood memory at all, which is certainly a good thing. Our server was very attentive and frequently checked on us to see if we were okay. Overall, Shang Artisan Noodle is definitely a place for a satisfying northern-noodle experience.",

In the past when I have had Chinese noodles, the broth lacked flavor so I needed extra soy sauce but here definitely not needed. We had the spicy wontons and the beef pancakes as an appetizer. Both were great! The beef pancakes are seriously addicting. I would eat them for breakfast everyday if I could. For my main dish I had the braised pork rib soup with the hand pulled noodles. It was amazing! My husband had the chicken and mushroom sauce noodles. When the portions came out my initial thought was that I might need another portion of noodles but ended up leaving full and happy. :)  The service is amazing. Steven gave us perfect details of the differences between all the noodle options (plain, hand pulled, or knife shaved.). He was very good at explaining the questions that we had. Lilianna was very friendly as well. Food came out in a timely manner. So when coming here, no need to worry about bad service. Can't wait to come back soon to try the other soups and other side dishes. *Drool.*",

Not sure what sauce was in the cucumber salad but it was wonderful.  The beef noodle was a dynamite dish.  The broth was not as rich as the Taiwanese ones I had but this one hit the spot.  I selected the hand carved noodles because it was less chewy than the knife cut ones.  So I will definitely be coming back",

I have tried the dan-dan noodles, peking zha-jiang noodle, beef shank noodle, beef pancake, spicy wonton, and beef and onion pot stickers. The food is alright, I feel the food lacks flavor and is sorta bland. Presentation wise looks good though and it's pretty cool seeing them make the noodles, but other than that the food is just whatevers.",

    "text": "I didn't really wasn't expecting much, but man are these great noodles. I'm only stopping by Las Vegas for a few nights and this was within walking distance of my AirBnB.  Service: pretty standard imo. The 3 waiters I've seen work here are attentive and friendly. Water refills aren't an issue and they answered my questions with ease. Food comes super quick too, speaking of which....  Food: I can't give this more stars. I don't know what it is, but I haven't had noodles as good as these in a long time. I hope I'm not hyping it up too much, but I REALLY enjoyed both bowls. I've gotten both the pork belly noodle soup and the shang beef noodle soup. Both were hand pulled noodles. The broths are absolutely delicious. It's super rich with flavor but isn't overpowering, salty or heavy. The shang beef noodle soup broth is a tad on the spicy side, but it's very manageable (plus they have chili sauce on the side if you want). The toppings that come standard are 2-3 cuts of bok choy and a small heap of spring onions. There's options to add extra toppings ($2.50, which is whatever the meat is), bean sprouts, extra noodles, extra broth, etc. The pork belly meat was pretty tender, but I think I enjoyed the shang beef so much more. It feels like it was braised for a long time; even the cuts of beef that had some sinew/connective tissue is still tender enough to easily bite through.  Honestly, I love this place. For under $10 a noodle bowl, I find it hard to beat with that price point. I seriously wish this place would move to San Diego. Or at the very least, if I ever come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again.",

The hand pulled noodles are you something I definitely thought the trip off the strip was worth taking an Uber for. The prices for the entire menu were great compared to the inflated pricing of everything on the strip. Love the fast casual concept but the execution of a True authentic Chinese flavors and food.   I ordered the Dan Dan noodles with minced pork and added some of the super tender beef. My wife ordered the same Dan Dan noodles without the beef add on. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavors were so good. I've been to Taiwan, HK and mainland China and I will say these are definitely some of the best noodles I've had.

I also love that staff are always making noodles by hand in the open kitchen.  On this visit I opted for the seafood noodle soup, which came with a couple shrimp, squid rings, and surimi-style fish slices as well as bok choy (note that the \"seafood\" nomenclature just refers to the meats - broth is still a pork-chicken combo). The seafood was all tasty, but I would have preferred the bok choy to have been cooked a little more. The noodles were the highlight as they were fantastic.  I'll admit that I'm a tonkotsu ramen junkie who prefers strong/aggressive broth flavors over the more subdued style typical of Chinese noodle soup, but I still found the pork/chicken combo broth satisfactory.  My group also split a beef pancake (this is more of the xian bing style) and a yang chow fried rice. The beef pancake was super juicy, and while the yang chow fried rice was a tad \"artisan-y\" and on the small side, it was still tasty.",

Not the best noodles in town for sure, even if they are hand-made. Cool concept though but nothing new.   I specifically ordered the Dan Dan Noodles because I LOVE Dan Dan Noodles. However, this dish left so much to be desired. (Shhhh .... Yunnan Tasty Garden on Spring Mountain has the best Dan Dan Noodles that I've had in LV. Trust. Their sauce is ah-mazing!)  The Wonton Noodle Soup was probably the best thing we ordered but not so great that I want to come back for it.   We also ordered the cucumber salad and it was drenched in a thick peanut sauce, I think. Yuck, I didn't like it at all.   I was really excited to try this place based on reviews but I won't be coming back. The place is super cute though and you can see them beating and twisting the noodle in front of you but I'm not here to watch a show.  I'm not being harsh. I just have high standards and Vegas being a major tourist attraction with millions of visitors a year should deliver nothing but the best.",

    "text": "I've been patiently waiting to visit this restaurant. It was one of my first stop when I visited Las Vegas last week.  Hand made noodles is an art and it's usually difficult to find a perfect match of excellent noodles, broth, and meat. If you're looking for that perfection then look no further...you'll find it here.  Pros- 1- Sliced Beef Shank- it's served cold with a semi-sweet sauce. It's delicious even without the sauce. The meat is perfectly sliced. It's tender with the right amount of tendons. 2- Spicy Wontons- is a must have. Note that I can handle spicy and I would rate the spiciness level 6 out of 10. My friend who attempted to eat it would rate it level 9. 3- Beef & Onion Potstickers- made in house and has a great presentation. 4- Shang Beef Noodles- Delicious large chunks of tender beef. It's the most generous amount of beef I've had in this type of soup. The broth has a great balance of herbs and meaty taste. 5- Pork Belly Noodle- It's not the pork belly that you would expect at a American restaurant. They use a traditional pork belly flavoring that includes Chinese 5 spices and other flavoring. Its is delicious and my friend who normally eats pork belly from American restaurants loved this style. 6- Easy parking. 7- Excellent service. Friendly and efficient. 8- Menu is simple and just the right amount of choices to not be overwhelmed.  9- Convenient location that is only a 10 minute drive from the strip. 10- Oh the noodles! Last but not least. Hand pulled noodles were nicely chewy and not too thick. The knife shaved noodles were excellent and with just the right amount of chewiness. Their portion were very generous.  Cons- 1- The potstickers had a bit too much dough. I like them thinner.  2- No locations in San Diego :(",

    "text": "I gotta say, for the amount of people waiting for Shang Artisan Noodles, this place was as average as it gets. Service was decent though.  I got the Dan Dan noodles with hand pulled noodles and the pork and cabbage potstickers. The issue with the Dan Dan is the sauce was not as peanut-y as I would have liked; the flavor lacked depth to it. It seemed like straight up soy sauce and chili oil, and the preserved veggies were not very pleasant with the noodles. Because of the flatness in flavor of the veggies sitting in the sauce, the veggies didn't add anything to the dish and tasted exactly like the sauce in which it was sitting. The dish would benefit greatly from a touch of sweetness or even vinegar. I think that would balance it out a lot more. That being said, maybe the soup noodles fare better than the dry.  The potstickers were also only ok. The skin was a little thick for my preference and almost seemed slightly undercooked. I don't think I'll be back.",

Mind you, me and my girlfriend are not a fan of Chinese food so it takes a lot of me to say that this restaurant won us over. Let me go over as to why:   Food: we shared an order of chow mein, beef noodle soup, and beef cakes. Very flavorful to say the least. When you're there, I highly subject to order soup since this is their highlighting meals. Regardless, I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the dishes.   Service: The noodles are handmade as you see attendants stretching the and kneading the dough. That was one of the most memorable parts of the visit and I love how transparent they are about cooking your food. You know you're eating quality dishes to the highest standard. Also the waiters were on point about their service. I love how friendly they were and always asked if we need anything else. The food was also quick to deliver with only the beef cakes that experienced a bit of a hiccup.   Ambiance: beautiful and modern. It's modest in size but very intimate for dinner with friends. Its brightly lit with adorable sets of utensils along with them. Every elements in the restaurant flowed with the design from the colors of the wall to the soup spoons.   Prices: amazing. It really shows that good food doesn't have to be expensive. And to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if they bumped up the prices just a tad bit more but the fact that they keep their prices low with large portions is admirable. They're definitely consumer-friendly in all aspects.   A must try when you're in the area! Oh and after your meal, save room for dessert which is found right next door!",

We tried to go the day the day before when the temperature outside was approaching 30 degrees F but as expected the place was packed, so we went when they opened the next day.  We ordered the spicy won ton and the beef and onion pot stickers as appetizers.  The spicy won ton wasn't that spicy but they gave quite a bit of them and they were good.  The beef and onion pot stickers were just okay no different than those I have tasted.  My friend had the seafood noodle and I had the Dan-Dan noodle.  When I ordered the Dan-Dan noodle the waitress asked what level of spiciness.  I did not know so I ordered the sauce on the side.  When the order came, I put half the sauce in the noodles and started to eat.  I think I put too much but it was okay just a little embarrassing sweating so much.  My friend said his didn't have taste so he decided to dump the rest of my sauce into his soup which made it too spicy.  And all of this at an affordable price, it is a shame this place wasn't bigger to seat more people.",

    "text": "A quaint newer noodle spot that seems to be growing in popularity! My good friend told me he was dying to check out this place and after glancing at the reviews I was happy to meet him for a late lunch.  The inside is small but bright and inviting. Light wooden decor in every direction and a few tables and bar seating where you're able to watch the art of handmade noodles in action.  The menu is small (a two sided menu) but there are solid choices all at decent prices:  - Cucumber Salad ($4.95) Cucumbers sliced vertically with a heaping mound of thick sesame sauce on top. The sauce was a bit much for me, although flavorful taste wise. I would prefer a light sauce/dressing on cucumbers but this sauce was too heavy and creamy. My friend didn't seem to mind, he thought there was a hint of peanut in it  - Spicy Wontons ($5.49) Heavenly. Silky Pork wontons doused in a spicy oil, topped with sesame seeds, black pepper, and chopped green onions. I thoroughly enjoyed the heat and taste of the spicy oil. Easily the best dish we ordered!  - Shang Beef Noodle ($8.95) Savory, piping hot bowl of noodle soup. Very hearty broth - you can tell that meat has been simmering in their broth for quite some time. I got the knife shaved noodles which was a great decision! Totally can taste the difference in the noodles and it's 100% fresh. So delicious! The braised beef brisket had some extra fatty parts but the non fatty parts were both tender and flavorful   There were two ladies working as servers and they were both polite and filled our waters when empty. Food came out at reasonable times and service was pretty decent. Nothing over the top spectacular but no complaints either.   My friend got the Pork Belly Noodle and he loved it. He said he personally was a fan of the flavor of the broth and the texture of the noodles! I could really tell that he enjoyed every bite of his noodle soup.  I will definitely come back and look forward to trying another noodle dish. I'll be sure to order the Spicy Wontons again!!",

We ordered the pork and cabbage pot sticker and the beef and onion boiled dumpling. They were both delicious, but I preferred the pork and cabbage potsticker. For the entree I ordered the shang beef noodle and my friend ordered the chicken and mushroom noodle.   shang beef noodle: is a soup based noodle. The soup is very light and slightly spicy and the beef was tender and flavorful. The chicken and mushroom noodle   Chicken and mushroom noodle: sauce based noodles. The sauce was delicious and incredibly flavorful. I actually liked the dish the most. The noodles were chewy and the chicken was cooked perfectly",

It's a small restaurant and the staff was very polite, friendly and pleasant. Didn't know what type of noodles to pick initially so we tried the hand pulled, looks like udon noodles kinda but very fresh And delicious. You can taste the freshness!! Knife cut is the thick flat noodles, didn't get to try this time but definitely will next time!!! Worth the 30 mins wait!",

    "text": "Luckily it was inexpensive. I am truly amazed at all the raving reviews because besides the fact that they make amazing noodles right in front of you it seems they don't know what to do with them after! The beef pancake that is so highly recommended by nearly every review needs flavor. ANY kind of flavor! It's just hot and oily and without the little pitcher of potsticker sauce to let it soak in it's just something to chew on. The pork potstickers came 6 on a plate and 5.5 were still on the plate when we left. They tasted like the peanut oil they were fried in and ONLY oil! The chicken chow mein was barely flavored and the chicken looked as if it was purchased already sliced and cooked. We had one bite of it and pushed it to the side. Finally the beef noodle soup left a lot to be desired. The knife shaved noodles were thick and chewy which was awesome, but the beef was so fatty and gristly it was spat into a balled up napkin and left on the counter for the busser to dispose of. The flavor of the soup was so confusing, almost as if it was a mix of a few different leftovers and thrown together with whole unsliced bok choy. My favorite part of the meal was the sprite in a bottle and the delicious complimentary water. We were expecting a crowded restaurant, but there were no more than 6 other patrons in there the whole time. When we finished the server asked if we wanted to take it home and when we said no he seemed as if he already knew. I assume it's an acquired taste, but I have eaten a LOT of noodles in a lot of parts of the world and I can't think of a time when I was more disappointed. Being an executive chef myself I would think to say it was an off night in the kitchen, but you could clearly see that this food was the norm. 1 Star for the attentive and smiling servers, 1 Star for the delicious water.",

I guess it's not a big deal but I just like their attention to detail. BTW, that attention to detail is also obvious in their food and decor. Three types of noodle choices and all hand made in-house.

I usually work around menus and see what is modifiable for a vegetarian diet (yeah, i'm that person) and the only item was the tomato and egg noodle. I've seen the item on several menus before but haven't yet had it, so I ordered that with the knife-shaved noodles and added bok choy to it. It was pretty delicious, loved the thick texture of the noodle. I was with two others that ordered the pork belly hand-pulled noodle and they said the pork was rather tough but the flavour was good.",

We definitely were not expecting to have such BOMB noodle soup right before going out on the town.   FOOD: Shang beef noodle soup: I was very impressed with the hand cut noodles and the broth!! I live near San Gabriel Valley which has pretty good noodle soup places and I think Shang noodle does it much better! Flavorful broth and so delicious.  Spicy wonton: This surpassed my expectations. My all time favorite place to get spicy wontons was Din Tai Fung, but it's actually fantastic here if not better! If you are familiar with Mama Lu's dumpling house in CA, just know that these wontons are about 50x better and have a nice amount of spice. I'd recommend this as an appetizer for anyone!  Overall: We had to wait about 15 minutes for a party of 5 on a Friday night around 8:00. I'm assuming the earlier you go the better! I would say that Shang Noodle is definitely worth the wait as I haven't found any better noodle place in Vegas. If you are craving noodz I would say Shang noodle is worth leaving the strip for!",

The hand cut noodles were fresh and we enjoyed watching the guy prepare them through the window!  The spicy wonton was drenched in a spicy soy sauce and tasted heavy and oily overall. Would have liked it better if there was less sauce so that I can enjoy the wontons :)  The pork & cabbage boiled dumping was nice and light and perfect to dip in your chili sauce. The beef pancakes were amazing, nicely browned on each side and not too oily.   Place is a bit small and there can be a wait depending on the time you go.

My favorites were the beef pancakes and chicken chow mien. The beef noodle soup was flavorful, however, the broth was too salty for my liking. Our entrees came out quick! I'd say within 5 minutes. Our beef pancakes took a while to come out. We were almost done with our entrees when the beef pancakes came out. Overall, the dishes were tasty (minus the beef soup) and I would come back and try the other items on their menu. Come give them a try!",

It wasn't bad in any way, and the folks were nice and the place was clean and comfortable, but the food wasn't anything to go back for. I ordered the beef pancakes.  The shell was too thick and the meat was too bland.  I ordered the beef noodle soup.  The brisket was cooked nicely and the hand-pulled noodles were fresh as can be...but just not much flavor.  My friend ordered the cucumber salad (cukes in a peanut sauce) and the mushroom chicken noodles but neither were exceptional.   Place is busy but I don't see what the fuzz is about. If you've been to any din tai fung and had their soup dumplings and love them, don't expect the food at this place to rival that.",

    "text": "On our visit to Sin City, we decides to venture off the strip and try this hand pulled noodle restaurant. We were not disappointed. The chili dumplings were delicious as were the noddle dishes we ordered. I had enough leftover for another meal.   We didn't have a car so we utilized the transit system and let me tell you, that was the best money we spent on the trip as we were able to go up and down the strip without suffering (much) from the over 105 degree dry heat (if you can't tell, I don't tolerate extreme heat well). Super easy to download the RideRTC app, buy day passes on your phone, and scan your pass from the phone once you get on the bus. Anyways, I digress...I meant to point out that the RTC stops caddy corner from this restaurant (coming from the strip) so it was fairly easy to get to.   The one minor downside to this eatery is the size of the restaurant; what you see in the picture is the exact size. We had to wait a little before we were seated as all the tables were full. But the service was good and they brought us what we asked for right away. I would go back again next time I visit.",

You can pick from 3 different types of noodles, but all do taste the same: hand-pulled noodles (the longest), knife cut (smaller sized noodle length), and plain (which is cut by a machine). My bf got the shang beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles and I ordered the tomato and scrambled egg with plain noodle (this was a dry noodle). Both were delicious. Broth was very flavorful and rich for the noodle soup.   We also ordered the cucumber salad. I'm used to it being a sort of pickled flavor with chili oil and spice, but this one was chili oil and sesame oil and drenched in some kind of peanut-like sauce. I didn't really like it but it's just a matter of preference.",

The beef noodle soup was tasy - it hit the spot after an early day start! The beef was tender, the broth was on point, and the noodles had thr perfect texture.  The potstickers were tasty but the sizes were smaller than usual. The plating is interesting as they crisp up the starchy water for a \"crust\"... it's visually pretty, but we would rather get the potstickers faster than the quoted 15min.  It took longer than thr noodle dishes and IMO too long for an appetizer if it doesnt really add to the flavor/texture.  The chicken sesame cold noodle lacked flavor.  Usually, sesame is a flavorful sauce, but we wonder if it was missing a soy base. There were as much noodles as shredded cucumber and carrots, and the shredded chicken portion was so small.  We love hand pull noodles, so we will be back to try the dan dan noodles.",

I'm from Los Angeles, and there are some good ones too such as A&J or Taipei's Famous beef noodle at Yongkan Street but I'm most particular about the noodles.   The knife peeled noodles are made in front of you, fresh.  The broth is not too salty and not too sweet as you find in other places.  We also ordered the spicy wonton, cucuber salad, potstickers and sliced beef shank as the appetizers.  None were a letdown.

My favorite dishes were the beef pancakes and dan dan noodles. The beef pancakes come in a set of 4 and they are pan seared and extra juicy. I really mean it when I say juicy. We had two juice squirting accidents (that sounds kind of wrong?) during our meal! The Shang beef noodle soup is also a tasty dish with good flavor and tender beef. Perfect for this Vegas winter weather!  It's especially fun with their open kitchen and work stations that you get to see the noodles being made and pulled right in front of you! You have the option of hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I've tried both now and prefer the hand pulled. The consistency and size of the knife cut were too all over the place that I didn't enjoy it too much.   They have a lot of different noodle dishes, both soups and dry/saucy noodles so everyone in your party can be in for a treat. The shop is on the smaller side so I wouldn't recommend coming with a large party. There is probably 8 tables total. There is bar seating as well.   Parking can get cramped in the lot since it's shared with a few other businesses but it shouldn't be a big deal.",

We had the sliced beef shank appetizer. It was totally not what I was expecting, and that's not a good thing. Fair warning...this is a cold dish. It is slices of cold beef shank drizzled with a reduced balsamic vinaigrette sauce. Meat was so bland and sauce was sour. Also had the Shang beef noodle HP, Peking wonton soup w/ HP noodles, and chicken and mushroom noodles HP. Everything looked fabulous, but taste did not compare to aesthetics. Beef noodle soup was decent flavored. Wonton soup was completely bland. Chicken and mushroom noodles were also bland. The noodles themselves were a great texture, but flavors overall were lacking.",

We ordered within a couple minutes and had our meal within 10 minutes.  Got to watch my wife's noodles shaved and prepared right in front of us. So fresh and so good. My Dan Dan noodle was also delicious. We also had spicy wonton which was just the right amount of spicy and tasted delicious. The price was great and the service was awesome. Thank you and we will be back again.",

I picked the perfect LV rainy winter night to go. -With having my mind already made up from what I saw I went with the Shang Beef Noodle( Beef Broth, Braised Beef Brisket, Baby BokChoy, cilantro) and chose the Knife-shaved noodle. A thicker noodle of the choices but I like this one the best. One of the best soups I have had thus far in town, so good I went back the next night and I had the Pork Belly noodle with the hand pulled noodles and it was very good. Service was on point even with it being busy and prices are very reasonable!",

I ordered the shang beef with knive cut noodles (beef chunks were the perfect size and texture but were of little quantity--my bowl had 4 full chunks at most, the knife cut noodles were chewy and filling, but the broth was overly salty)-1.5 stars  The rest of the stuff we ordered was a thumbs down unfortunately. The spicy wonton was NOT spicy but sour and otherwise lacked flavor--I actually didn't even taste the filling. The pork and cabbage potstickers were totally bland too with the dumpling wrap being a little on the thicker side. The cumber salad was plentiful but it consisted of fresh cucumbers that they drizzled with a thick,  bland (again) sesame/?peanut paste that did not suit my taste buds at all. The dan dan noodle was super dry- it really lacked the spice and sauce found at most taiwanese noodle house. The hand pulled noodles in the dan dan was super hard and undercooked also. Maybe it was an off day?  I personally didn't think it was worth the wait and likely will not return.",

Beef pancakes were hot and fresh, soy sauce was flavorful without being overly salty. I recommend the beef pancakes as an appetizer. Free cucumber and lemon infused water is a bonus! Waiter was knowledgeable about noodle types and textures as well as popular dishes. Beef broth combined with leaf spices is fenominal. The hand-pulled noodles are a great blend of soft and chewy. Friend had the knife-shaved noodles and these were more chewy than the hand-pulled. Hand pulled texture was between that of Udon and Ramen. The shang beef brisket was cut in wholesome, lean chunks in the soup. Soup has bockchoy and green onions. I will definitely come back again. The restaurant space is small, so there is often a wait on the weekend for lunch, but if your party is small (2 people), you will be seated quickly. Overall, if you want an authentic Chinese noodle soup experience in Las Vegas, come here first.",

The beef pancakes were our favorite! It's a thick dough which had a yummy filling and also had soup (I believe?) in it, but be careful, it's piping hot! We also tried their hot tea, it had a roasted peanut taste, which was interesting and nice.  I already knew I wanted to get their beef shank soup with hand pulled noodles! It was simply delicious and how I expected it to taste. Knowing the noodles are made from scratch is so refreshing to me. The boyfriend got Zha-Jiang noodles. He honestly didn't enjoy it because of the lack of pork and it just didn't taste right to him. He enjoyed my dish better!  The server was attentive and was informative whenever we had questions. Overall, prices were low, we enjoyed the flavors and everything just looked so aesthetically pleasing! We'd definitely would come again!",

Line was long during normal lunch hours, however the waitresses there often went around offering water (which was pretty nice) to the crowds indoors, some watching the noodle pulling while waiting. Also brought things out pretty efficiently and refilled water when empty.  The food though. Where to start?  The chili wonton and it's tasty sauce, the juicy, crunchy beef pancake, the pork belly noodle soup, the beef noodle soup, and even the potstickers (which got ousted by how good the other dishes were).  Each were delicious, can't compare to the same dishes in Bay Area. Trying to describe it won't give it justice with how much I enjoyed it.  Definitely worth the wait and try!

Place was pretty empty when we arrived (but we were eating at an off time so that probably helped) so were quick to be seated.  If I had to choose again what again I would go with the spicy won tons for an appetizer and would have a hard time choosing between the DanDan noodles (with the shaved noodle) or the beef soup. Husband got the jjajjangmyun but it wasn't like the traditional black bean noodle that we were used to so would probably wouldn't order it again (still tasted good tho...just wasn't what we were expecting).",

We didn't get it this night for them to try but they def want to try the next time.  I got the pork belly noodle soup this time. The pork belly's broth is more flavorful than the shang beef which is more subtle but I still prefer the shang beef. The meat on the pork belly wasn't as tender the further away from the fatty part it is. But it was still good.

For appetizers, we got sliced beef. It's a cold dish and the beef is dry and hard to chew. I had one slice and that was it.   2nd appetizer: spicy wonton - which was not too spicy but lacked flavor. I had to add soy sauce to mine.   3rd appetizer: beef pancakes - careful eating this. The juice inside can squirt out to 12 inches. This also lacked flavor and just tasted like deep fried dough.   For the main course I tried the chicken and mushroom noodle. I had to let the noodle sit in the sauce for a while before it really soaked in. It's a thicker sauce.   Another main course was the pork belly noodle soup (prob the only favorite thing I tried today). Plenty of pork belly and bok choy in this dish.   Service was great, but the food wasn't. I probably won't come back here.",

First night husband and I ordered pork belly noodles (with plain noodles) and wonton noodles (with hand-pulled noodles). The pork belly noodles tasted great. Although the pork belly was not tendered enough, the soup and noodles were perfect. The wonton noodles would be a good choice for people preferring a milder taste. However, the wontons were too tiny. The table next to us ordered the beef pancakes and they looked so attractive. Too bad my husband does not eat beef so we didn't order it. They really should consider making a version using pork.   The next day we ordered a chicken chow mein for take out. It was my favorite! It actually looked and tasted simliar to a very delicious yakisoba without the annoying taste of Worchestershire sauce.

    "text": "I fulfilled my noodle craving in this centrally located noodle shop today!  As you walk in, you'll notice a nice, open, minimalistic, clean atmosphere.  You're served with yummy watermelon infused water.  Your utensils have a traditional look to them.  Your server does a great job explaining the menu.  I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and spicy wontons.  The Dan Dan noodles had quite a bit of kick to it since it's minced pork mixed with some chilli oil.  Got the hand pulled noodles.  You can tell the noodles were handmade, just by the texture and taste.    The spicy wontons came in a small bowl, but had more wontons than you'd expect.  They're a smaller size, but they're shareable between 2 people and filling.  I believe the wontons were mixed with some chilli oil and a little bit of soy sauce.  Excellent flavor.    Also, prices are very reasonable (less than $10).  My filling Dan Dan Noodle was $7.99.    I'd like to try the chicken and mushroom noodles next time.",

We were sick of buffets and American food and we decided to go back to our Chinese roots to look for a Chinese place! Good thing we found this place. Stumbling upon this restaurant on Yelp with it's homey atmosphere and inviting nature, we chose to go here on our last night in Vegas. The server was the best server we had in Nevada. Other hotel servers don't really care but our server here gave us such great customer service, my boyfriend tipped him $10! The biggest tip he gave to anyone, just because of this great experience! The food was exceptional and just want we missed. The noodles, meat, wontons and cucumber dish with sesame peanut butter sauce in specific. I want to thank this restaurant for a great food dining experience and a great ending to our Vegas trip. Will definitely be back when we are visiting!",

Had the Shang beef noodle soup with knife-shaved noodles. That soup was delicious and so were the pot stickers as a side. Quaint little place and kept well. I will definitely be back for a quick lunch - I highly recommend this place for those noodle soup aficionados out there. Menu is not overwhelming at all - a good variety of sides, soups and other dishes are offered. Soup was so good I forgot to take photos. I will definitely take photos on my next visit, gotta taste everything on the menu!!!!!",

Their favorite is the beef soup with the hand-pulled noodles. The broth is perfectly seasoned, and the baby bok choy offers that perfect crunch while eating. For appetizers I highly recommend the cucumber salad -- the satay sauce is a little spicy but I find the whole thing refreshing. I also love all of the dumplings they offer along with the beef pancake! I usually order their hot tea as well. Unlimited refills and quite tasty!

Would eat an entire order to myself if we didn't order so many dishes. Beef pancake was also delicious and our picky son even enjoyed their chowmein with hand cut noodles. To be critical, I felt the spicy wonton lacked a little substance, but still worth a second try. Not to mention 5 dishes, two beers and only $50 with tip! Good luck getting that much hand crafted food on the strip, this good, for that much! We'll be back and we're going to continue to leave the strip for grub!  FYI, they provided great service, were very accommodating of the baby, and were very courteous. Place is not big, so be prepared to wait if you come at peak dinner hours or on weekends. We were here on a Tuesday (4th of July).",

It's so cool watching the chef hand pull the noodles!   Pork Belly Noodle: The broth was decently flavored and the pork belly was tender.  I think the broth to the Shang Beef Noodle was better though, but that's cos it was at the right spice level for me!   Spicy Wonton: I wish they added some vinegar to this or something.  It was a little bland and definitely was not spicy enough!  Definitely recommend any of the noodle dishes here because their noodles are cooked perfectly and so soft!",

    "text": "Excellent service and delicious food off the beaten path of the Las Vegas strip! We decided to venture out today instead of sticking to our tried and True strip faves and we were glad we did! We are noodle lovers, and this place was right up our alley. Highly recommended to any soup and dumpling loving foodies that appreciate passion, talent and tons of flavor being put into their meal.   This tiny spot seats about 20 total in the restaurant and probably another dozen up at the bar facing the open concept kitchen.  This is where you can watch the noodle magic happen, as they hand toss and pull and even knife cut (if you so desire) their Artisan noodles. Who knew creating noodles could be such an art form?  I ordered the seafood soup with the hand pulled noodles which I really enjoyed. The light, savory broth blew me away with a wonderful flavor that I haven't really tasted before. A generous helping of shrimp, fish cake and squid rounded out the dish. Hubby had the braised beef soup with the knife cut noodle. Very rich and savory broth, and the knife cut noodles were a bit thicker and had a great chew to them. The pork and cabbage potstickers were a visual delight (see photos-- almost too pretty to eat), but to be honest I was a bit underwhelmed on the flavor. Looking at the dish your expectations are incredibly high, so I was disappointed that the flavor wasn't as impressive as the presentation.   Unfortunately there is no beer or wine here, which I strongly feel would have elevated our dining experience and upped the star rating. But overall, we really enjoyed our meal at Shang Artisan Noodle.",

It's perfectly salty, beefy and savory to the max. You can pick from three kinds of noodles: thin noodles, hand pulled noodles, and knife cut noodles. Knife cut is the thickest. They also hand pull the noodles in front of you at the bar!   The last time I went I got to try the dan Dan noodles and the beef pancakes. The beef pancake is more like a beef crispy bun. It's extremely juicy like a soup dumpling so beware of projectile juices when biting. The dan Dan noodles look plain but the sauce is on the bottom. It's not that spicy but it's still pretty good however I will still get the Shang noodle soup because it's my favorite.",

We all ordered the hand pulled noodles and they were so goood. I had the Shang beef noodle and the broth was so flavorful, the beef was soft, the bok choy gave it good texture. I was able to try the dan dan noodle and I actually wish I ordered that for myself instead.

    "text": "Finally got to check out the new hand-pulled noodle spot that has been popping up all over.    The restaurant is a little small, I think I saw around 6 two-seater tables and 10 bar seats.  Luckily, the bar was open, so my boyfriend and I was able to snag a spot with ease.    Our server Pita recommended a number of items, right off the bat.  She was very helpful!  We ended up going with the Dan Dan Noodles, Shang Beef Noodle, and Spicy Wontons and Beef Pancakes to share.    Spicy Wontons - comes with around 10 wontons, but be warned that they are tiny!  I was under the impression from pictures that the wontons were bigger, but that's where the tiny soup bowl comes in.  I liked the flavor!  They used some of those Sichuan peppes in the sauce to give it that tingly feeling.  Tingly, but not overpowering.   Beef Pancakes - we were warned beforehand that it takes an extra 10 minutes to come out.  I would say these were worth the wait.  The pancakes are shaped like scallops!  The outside was nice and crispy, and the beef inside was tasty.  It pairs well with the dipping sauce and chili oil on the table.    Dan Dan Noodle - noodles on a bed of minced pork and a spicy soy sauce.  A very simple, but flavorful dish.  My boyfriend added more chili oil to it and I enjoyed it more with that extra kick!    Shang Beef Noodle - braised beef noodle soup with bok choy.  My boyfriend waited quite a while to enjoy his food because my soup hadn't come out.  When it finally did come out, I noticed the beef wasn't tender, the soup was a bit sweet and had no depth of flavor, and the broth was just warm.  For their namesake dish, I expected more.  I would not order this next time.   Cucumber Salad - comes with A LOT of cucumbers with a sesame sauce, some chili oil, and sesame seeds on top.  Very light and refreshing!  It pairs nicely with all the oily and fried food we ate.   All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Shangs.  I loved watching the noodle man pull noodles so happily in front of us.  The servers are very attentive and helpful.  And for the most part, I enjoyed the food.",

So they gave my table away.   Just make sure you wait inside all crowded and packed blocking the entrance. Otherwise they will give your table away.  Originally I wanted to give a 1 star based on what happened before I sat down.   However after eating here and the professional way they handled the situation this place deserves 5 stars.   I do understand that in a busy environment things happen but the really know how to handle and fix the problem.  The food was wonderful. Even my picky young son ate a lot of the hand pulled noodles we ordered. All the items we ordered were a hit with my family- they cleaned up all the items.",

    "text": "My daughter and I tried the shang beef noodle soup with their hand pulled noodles along with their pork and cabbage dumplings for dinner tonight.  It was amazing!  I don't usually go out of my way to eat gluten, but this one was worth the hit!  They make the noodles fresh... not from yesterday, but you're served noodles that are made right in front of your eyes (esp. if you sit at the bar which we did).  It was enough to share with my 4 year old.  The soup didn't taste like it was full of MSG. Bonus!  The potstickers came when we were finishing up the noodles.  It was a little backwards but I still loved how they tasted fresh.  They make the dumplings fresh there along with the skin.  It's amazing and unusual in presentation.  The skin's a little thicker than other places, because they roll the skin there.  The service itself was friendly and prompt for a relatively busy Fri night.  I LOVED the spa water.  Ours tasted like cucumber.  I think one Yelper complaining about the water couldn't tell that it's actually cucumber and not watermelon skin (yuck and who would do that?).  I wanted more water, but I was too full to drink any more water.  If I'm in the mood for hand-pulled noodles in Vegas, I'm coming back.",

I love the fact that they offer regular noodles, hand pulled and the knife cut! Knife cut noodles are one of my personal favorites and it went really well with the broth of the soup. The spicy wontons was a little of the small portion size but there was a nice dusting of sichuan peppercorn dust on them. I'd say it's on par with the asian noodles places back in LA and not too overpriced either.  Service is friendly, and the restaurant itself is pretty modern, clean and bright. Cute painting on the walls of the womens restroom too!",

If you prefer something not spicy, go for the Shang beef noodle, the tenderness of the meat and the richness of the soup will make you want another bowl.

I was a little peeved that they took away our drinks as they didn't allow outside food.  * BEEF NOODLE SOUP - 5 stars: The beef noodle soup was amazing, I LOVED the noodles. They are smooth and chewy and so delicious. Better than my favorite, Liang's! I preferred the beef noodle soup broth over the pork broth but enjoyed how fatty the pieces of pork were. The wide noodles are much better than the thin. * JIAJIANG NOODLES - 5 stars: If you like jiajiang mian, you will love this black bean noodle dish. * SPICY WONTONS - 3.5 stars: Decent spicy wontons but nothing compared to the delicious ones at Din Tai Fung.  * POTSTICKERS - 2.5 stars: They look amazing because they come out as a single piece, similar to DTF, but they were bland and overly oily tasting. * BEEF PANCAKE ROLLS - 2.5 stars: These came out scalding hot and fresh, but unfortunately they were so oily and bland, very similar to the potstickers. The beef inside was disappointing.  Shang is worth the trek off strip if you're craving noodles, definitely get the famous wide hand-shaved noodles (better than the original thin) and stick with the beef noodle soup or jia jiang mian!",

I've tried the beef noodle, chow mein (not something I'd usually order), and the wontons. Verdict: I want more of all three. My only disappointment has been that the very friendly waiter didn't know what ingredients go into the chili oil (not that I expected to be given a recipe).",

My friends had the spicy won-tons.  I had the chicken and mushrooms.  I wasn't a huge fan of that because I don't care for wood ear mushrooms( most are dehydrated and then rehydrated).  My wife had the chicken chow mien and we all agreed, it was our favorite.  My friends also had a beef noodle soup.   We arrived around 5:30pm on a Sunday and we didn't have to wait.  If we'd arrived much later, we would have had a long wait.  I loved that they did not try and rush us through our dinner.",

This is my second time coming here and for good reason -- this place just has one of the best beef stews. I've found places in 626 area that are comparable, but when it's cold, and you're just craving for a simple bowl of noodles, come to this place. The wait averaged probably 30-45 mins, but if you're ok with the bar, the wait is somewhat faster. I always default to the beef stew with hand pulled noodles and it's just great. I decided to try their beef-pancake-dumpling thing on their menu and that too was super delicious! It does take a while for it to come out, but it's so juicy and flavorful at the same time. Excellent service from everyone. Will definitely becoming back one day.",

You can watch the chefs in action preparing your meal. Very entertaining. Your noodles are made fresh in front of you. No processed crap here.   My highlight for this restaurant was how flavorful and high quality their food was.   I started with the recommended beef cake. Full of flavor and tender, must use their sauce for beef cake. Please order prior to your entree as It takes longer to make.   Shang beef noodle was phenomenal. Broth was a 20/10 if I could mark It that high. Full of rich flavor and deep red color. The beef was tender and had bits of fat to add to the complexity of the soup. Not too fatty and everything was melt in your mouth.  Please wear a dark colored shirt if you choose beef broth soup here I stained my white shirt with my novice noodle eating skills lol.   You have 3 options for your noodles.  Knife sliced - thick and chewy  Skinny - spaghetti like Original - thicker but soft   I opted for the knife sliced, fun and chewy how I thought I wanted It but next time will opt for original.   Definitely a must and will be back.",

They don't serve ramen, but they serve dumplings and noodle soup!   The food: FYI, they serve 3 different types of noodles. Plain, handmade and knifed shaven! The most popular one is the handmade. I mean, you get to watch your noodles made from scratch! How cool is that? However, I was more fond of the knifed shaven noodles. I love chewy noodles! My boyfriend and I ordered, beef pancakes, shang beef noodle soup & the pork belly noodle soup. We pretty much ordered the popular dishes. The Shang Beef didn't disappoint me. The brisket was chewy and the broth was rich and had a slight kick to it! Although, I seemed to enjoy the pork belly even more! The broth was sweet! I tend to prefer sweet broths over salty/spicy ones. Now going to the beef pancakes! Omg, these little dumplings were juicy af and moist! Definitely something good to start with.   The service: 5 stars all the way! We were greeted right away and definitely felt welcomed! Our server Steven, recommended excellent dishes! He was on point with the water refills (this is a big thing for me in a lot of food places lol) and made sure we were enjoying our meal. Thank you again Steven! You're the sweetest! Great customer service!",

Our family were craving for hot soup, noodle experience and we found Shang via yelp. The service was excellent! Pir server was attentive; never had to request to refill our glasses, or for utensils. She was very friendly & knowledgeable about the food. She well-differentiated hand-pulled noodles from the other types. Food was quick to come, and was in order- appetizer, soups, entrees. The place was small but because the food came in the right sequence there was good enough room to enjoy and share each plate. The downside to this place is the taste- very flavorful. And if you were to order the way we did, going berserk and wanting to try every single item on the menu, it will be an overwhelming taste in your palate. Im hoping to come back and giving it a shot but this time going easy. I'll definitely recommend it to friends and family!",

They are so quick getting your food to you- after ordering we don't have to wait more than 10 minutes before you're eating. The service is always spectacular as well. The servers are kind, attentive, and helpful. We brought our 3 month baby this time around and they were very family friendly.  We recommend the Shang beef noodle soup and the Peking zha-jiang noodle (sauce noodle). Overall it's a wonderful experience.",

The place is clean, polite service, and price is good for hand pull noodle. I bet it takes years of years to get that skill of hand pulled noodle. My 5 years old son is so picky when it comes to eating out. But this is the only place I can see him eating almost the whole Shangs beef noodle. I'm so glad it is not spicy. Because most of time of beef noodle soup is too spicy. Sometimes it harder for taking ur child out to eat. They are very authentic traditional Chinese noodle soup bowl. Will be back again! Almost forgot to mention this: they serve water melon water instead of lemon water. That makes this unique then others!! Enjoy ur food here.",

For the hand pulled noodle, I didn't see any texture of the flour, it's not chewy at all, just like the ShangHai noodle I got from the Asian market. I don't think the specialty is their hand pulled noodle. You will see a guy hand pulling the noodle, but where is the texture of the noodle suppose to have ??? However, pot sticker was really good, crispy and juicy. Hopefully they will work on their noodles more. Price is definitely a thumbs up.",

I've driven by many times and decided to check it out with a friend of mine.  We shared the spicy wonton appetizers and the pan fried potstickers filled with pork and cabbage.  The wonton appetizers were very flavorful as they showed up partially dipped in their spicy sauce which looked spicier than actually tasted.  The pork and cabbage potstickers were very filling because of the thick wrappers used and the plentiful contents inside which were cooked perfectly and quite juicy.  A summer dish I recommend is the shredded chicken with carrots and cucumbers dry noodle since it is vey light and the sesame sauce has the right amount of texture and flavor to compliment the ingredients.  My only knock on the dish was the knife shaved noodles I chose which seemed too heavy for the dish, I recommend the hand pulled since they are thinner and not as filling.  The open kitchen is great but seating is limited for larger groups.  A go to spot for authentic Asian noodles!",

Maybe there's actually a good number of decent Chinese places here!  My husband had previously tried this place while on a short trip to Vegas and brought me to try it out this time. We ordered the beef pancake, Shang beef noodle soup, dan dan noodles, and the spicy wontons. For both noodle dishes, we got the hand-pulled noodles. They have the options of knife cut (wide, chewy noodles), hand-pulled (not-too-thick-but-thicker-than-spaghetti, al dente noodles), and plain (their thinnest option, machine cut noodles). The flavor for both were good, though the beef noodle broth could have been richer/deeper. The dan dan was not as Szechuan-spicy as other places I've had it at but it was still enjoyable. This dan dan also did not have sesame paste in their sauce, but each place has their own version of the sauce.   The wontons and pancake were great as well. I do wish their wontons were a little bigger but it's not a big deal. The pancakes were perfectly pan fried and browned on the bottom, and there was a good amount of soup when biting into it. The meat filling was also slightly dry but not overly so.   Would definitely come back and eat here again!",

My mom and I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, beef rolls, pork and cabbage potstickers, and the spicy wontons. These potstickers are by far the best potstickers I've had in a long time. They are juicy, flavorful, have a wonderful crunch on the outside and are moist on the inside. They're absolutely fantastic. I just had them for lunch and talking about them makes me want more! The beef rolls were so unique and delicious as well. The spicy wontons had a wonderful flavor to them and they were definitely living up to their spicy name. My only gripe would probably be the Dan Dan noodles. While I will not deny that they were delicious and the tanginess of the meat mixed well with the slight broth/sauce on the noodles, I actually kind of wish there was more broth/sauce on them. Other than that, they were nice and spicy and definitely a treat. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It was a fantastic experience and you can be sure I'll be coming here again.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try Shang Artisan Noodle thanks to IG. When you walk in, there is a host stand and a server will direct you to a table. There are only 6 tables and about 11 bar top seats. Its not a very big restaurant, but it was very bright, clean and there's an open kitchen so you can see them making fresh noodles right in front of you.   The menu was simple enough, and our server did explain to us that there were different types of noodles that we could choose from. We were given fruit infused water.   3.5/5 for the spicy wontons. Oh man! With all the pictures on yelp, I was expecting a larger portion size. The 3 of us started off with the spicy wontons and were disappointed at how small the bowl was. Nonetheless, it was very good. I could have eaten 10 bowls as my main entree. It wasn't spicy at all though, so my friends did add in some of their hot sauce on the table. (Be careful with that and pour some into your spoon BEFORE you pour it over whatever dish you want!) There were only 9 wontons in the bowl and it left me wanting more. It was perfectly cooked and the meat was soft. However, the sauce that it came in was a bit watered down. My friend commented that they should have strained it a bit longer.   My friend and I ordered the Shang beef hand pulled noodles and her bf ordered the pork rib noodle with hand pulled noodles. To my surprise, my order came out with knife shaved noodles. The water didn't check back on us and I didn't say anything because I didn't want them to waste it.   3/5 for the Shang Beef noodles.The knife shaved noodles was ok, I normally like hand shaved noodles because I feel that it can be very doughy/chewy and hard to eat. My friends thought the beef broth was PERFECT. They slurped it all up. I thought the beef broth was a bit on the salty side. Maybe it was because we came at night so they were heating the broth up all day? Not sure. There were large, soft chunks of braised beef brisket. I had so much meat that I ended up giving a few pieces to my friend who ordered the pork rib noodles. I will add extra bok choy ($0.75) next time because I felt that it needed more vegetables.   Pork rib noodles comes with pork broth. My friend enjoyed his dish but said that he would not order it again because it came with too little meat. He will probably the Shang Beef Noodles next time. My friends enjoyed their hand pulled noodles and gave me some to try as well. I really liked it.  Service was ok. We waited a while for the check and for the waitress to process our check even though the restaurant was about 1/3 full. I would recommend that the waitresses have checks prepared for tables that look like they are almost done eating so when they come by to pick up empty bowls/clear the tables, they can also drop off the check. It would be more efficient, especially when it starts to get busy.",

We look for every chance we get to get away from the blinding superficiality and lumbering masses of \"the strip\" for a bit of respite, quiet and legit, unpretentious food, unadorned with affected celebrity. We googled around and found this place and decided to give it a try.  The space was unassuming from the outside, bright, clean, open and well put together on the inside. We were really happy to see what was on the menu and indeed the options for their specialities, which were noodles.  Most notably the \"hand pulled\" and \"knife cut\" options for your noodles.  Everything we ordered was fresh, well prepared, very nicely seasoned and flavored. My main entree was the chilled chicken and sesame noodle dish and I opted for the knife cut style. On any hot day in this city, I would welcome a meal like this. Yeah, I loved it.  Shang Artisan Noodle is NOT your Panda Express or PF Chang type experience. And I mean that in the best ways.  We were all really happy with our dinner this evening. This is going on our short list of places to return to the next time we are stuck in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday evening with some friends, a few days after their opening.   Upon first glance, the kitchen reminded us of Noodle Man, on the southwest side of town, which offers similar type of food and hand made noodles. They specialize in fresh hand-pulled noodles and knife-cut noodles. It is near the popular Yonaka Japanese and newly opened Very Berry Cafe, this plaza is about to be really popular as these 3 places are really good... BUT PARKING SUCKSSS.... parking is very limited in this area as it goes down the hill into the gas station and McDonalds  Number of tables is limited but i believe the restaurant can seat 20-30 people fairly easily, with 2-4 person tables and counter tables facing the kitchen.   3 of us had ordered the Shang Beef Noodle which consisted of beef broth, beef brisket, and veggies. 2 of the 3 with hand-pulled noodles and 1 (mine) being knife-cut noodles. 1 of us got the Pork Rib Noodle with hand-pulled noodles which is fairly similar but consists of pork broth, braised pork rib, and veggies. Both priced at $8.49. The smell of the braised pork ri  We were served watermelon infused water which was nice and refreshing. At first we saw the slightly murky water and questioned it until the waitress told us XD   The orders came out fairly quick (we were the only table in the restaurant). 2 of the 3 hand-pulled noodles had a good al dente texture. 1 may have sat a little longer than the others. My hand-cut noodles were a little short of al dente in the middle but quite soft on the edges. Maybe a minute less would be perfect.   Soup flavor was very nice and not overpowering. The spoons they give us to use sucks for eating with as it was a straight spoon so it was a bit awkward to hold and get soup. The beef brisket was super flavorful and tender ! Very good quality and delicious.   When we were almost finished, they had brought us a cold celery peanut salad with shredded carrot. Quite flavorful. Flavor reminds me of the chinese marinating liquid \"loh sui\". Pretty tasty and the chilled app was nice.   Overall pretty good place. Might actually prefer this place over Noodle Man now. :) Good to try if you are in the area",

The food was cold by the time it got to us. But it was still tasty!!... so I can only imagine how good it is when it's hot.   We had (in order of preference) -  the  spicy wontons (the sauce and spices on it were yummyy)   - the peking wonton soup with knife shaved noodles (the broth was satisfying...and the noodles are a great combination of soaked in broth yet firm)   - the hand-pulled dan dan noodles (I liked the texture of the noodles)   The price is very reasonable for the quantity.   Another bucket list item - check!! Yayy!",

    "text": "The first time I heard of Shang Artisan Noodle was on an Eater article some time ago. I had completely forgotten about this place until we saw it one night while going to the cafe next door. So what did we do? We came back the next day for dinner!   It was a Saturday night and it turns out to be their third day in business! Whoa! We have such good timing then! We love trying new places out! The food that Shang Artisan Noodle offers, as well as their seating placements, reminded us a lot of Noodle Man (located on Rainbow and I-215.) They even have a guy that's showcasing how he hand pulls the noodles in the open kitchen!   Shang Artisan Noodle offered four different types of soup noodles: beef noodle, pork belly noodle, pork rib noodles, and seafood noodles. Of those, you get to choose what KIND of noodles you want: knife cut noodles, hand pulled noodles, or regular noodles. My boyfriend and I got their beef noodle with hand pulled noodles. My friend got their beef noodle with knife cut noodles and my other friend got their pork rib with hand pulled noodles.  You can absolutely tell that the noodles were hand pulled because they were all different widths! The noodles that I had in my bowl were a good texture and somewhat al dente, however, my boyfriend stated that his noodles were a little mushy. I'm not sure if that's because his was sitting in his bowl a bit longer or it came that way. His bowl and my friend's bowl with knife cut noodles were served first so they waited for us to get our food before digging in. The beef were really really tender, which is really good! That means they braised it long enough!!! My friend's pork ribs were pretty yummy as well -- it as a really good and familiar flavor to it! Tastes like mom's braising!   The soup base, on the other hand, was a little on the light side. I mean, it can be seen as a good thing or bad thing. To me, I felt as though it was missing something. To other people, it may seem to be the perfect balance. It's not like I'm going to drink the whole bowl of soup so it's fine.   Towards the end of our meal, they gave us a complimentary dish of celery salad! It was a cold salad with celery, peanuts, and carrots! I love celery! And the sauce that they used was really yummy :)! Would definitely get this dish again.   Also! They serve you watermelon infused water, which is really unique. I can't say I liked it though haha. I'm not a watermelon fan so watermelon infused water doesn't do much to me. You are able to just ask for regular water!  Overall, decent food and decent prices. I loveeee hand pulled noodles! So glad that the Chinatown area finally has something like this hear by. Would definitely recommend people in trying this place :)",

The broth was dark, rich and flavorful, the brisket was tender, the bok choy was crisp, and the hand pulled noodles were cooked perfectly. Everyone else ordered won ton with noodles hand pulled and knife shaved. They all enjoyed it. We also ordered beef pancake and potstickers. I must say the potstickers were some of the best I've ever had. Nice chew, perfect crunch on one side, and the filled was seasoned to perfection. The beef pancakes was good, not spectacular just good. I think I'd rather order two potstickers instead next time.  The entire staff was very professional and outstanding. The restaurant was clean and so was the restroom, big plus. I'll definitely come back again. Two thumbs up!",

There are three different types of cuts you can get for turn noodles (hand-pulled, knife cut, or round). The broth was very flavorful and the beef pancakes were very juicy. The portions are pretty large too. The waiter was very attentive and came to check up on us multiple times! He even brought over extra napkins when he saw the juice from the beef pancakes splashed out and I was trying to bite it.   I would definitely come back here again :)",

They were really juicy and had a great flavor. The chow mein was good with the knife shaped noodles which was recommended by our waiter. We loved them both so much that we decided to order the beef pancake too so we could try it. Those were beef and onions with some spices wrapped in dough and fried, they were great too. We will definitely be going back!",

Service was prompt and everything was served quickly and fresh!   Noodle soup--I tend to prefer flat noodles, but this was delicious regardless! Definitely a must if you're a fan of the five spice flavor. I like a little heat so definitely added some of the hot paste that's available.  Spicy wontons--so delicious. Love the subtle Sichuan base, sesame seeds, and white pepper.  Beef pancake--you've got to be careful with these guys! They come out piping out and can surprise squirt you! Thankfully our server warned us so no surprises there, lol. Delicious filling inside and exterior was crispy yet chewy.   Yum!",

The restaurant has a comfy feel; minimalistic look that I love. You can have a table or sit at the \"bar\" and where you can see the noodles/food is made.   We started with Spicy Wontons, Beef Pancakes and Sliced Beef Shank. In my opinion, I really liked the pancake and the wontons. The shank wasn't something I liked :( for my taste buds, but my group liked it. The spicy wontons reminded me of Ding Tai Fung's, but a little more spicy, which I like. 2 out of 3 of the appetizers that I recommend :)!   The main dish that I got was Peking Wonton Soup w/ Knife-Shaved Noodles and Bok Choy. It was amazing! But I think if I got the Hand-Pulled Noodles with it instead, it would have been less filling. And the amount of green onion they put on top... is mouth watering. One of my friends got the Dan-Dan Noodles... Those are.. just too spicy for me; the Spicy Wontons are my perfect type of spicy.. but Dan-Dan was too spicy, BUT very good!   Definitely would recommend this place! 10/10 would go again!",

My boyfriend and I walked in and the first thing we noticed was how packed this place was and now we know why. The staff here was extremely efficient, friendly, and all had a smile on their face! We sat the bar, which I think is the best seating in the house. From the bar you can see the noodles being freshly hand pulled as well as the dumplings being made fresh. We ordered the dan dan noodles with hand pulled noodles, beef noodle soup with the knife shaved noodles, spicy wontons, and pork pan fried potstickers. Everything was amazing, the noodles had a great texture and everything was full of flavor! the best part was that everything tasted wonderfully fresh and clean! Like it wasn't gonna make you feel heavy afterwards! Overall this place was a delicious find!   Lastly, if you come after 3pm it might not be as packed; but it's definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "Despite how many times I've been to Vegas over the years (read: quite a few), my friends and I would never stray far from The Strip.  A couple of trips to Fremont St and the outlets, but that was about it.  Which always bummed me out since I knew there were plenty of interesting places to try.  So, with my conference over and nowhere else to be, this was the perfect time to check out something new!  Something like...a nice, hot bowl of beef noodle soup!  After hearing so many great things about Shang Artisan Noodle, I almost immediately put them at the top of my list of Vegas bookmarks.  Once I stepped inside and took a look at the menu though, it's easy to see why folks like them so much.  Not only did all of their noodle dishes look really good, but so did all of their different types of dumplings and potstickers!  Fortunately, I was able to make my way back on another stop in town before I could get to writing this, so I got to try even more for my review!  -- BEEF PANCAKE (4 pieces)...$5.49 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=xxw1xgg_hu3xW-hPI-uHuA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>) More dumpling than \"pancake\", but this was pretty interesting!  In a way, this is essentially like a sheng jian bao (fried pork soup dumpling) with its pan-fried skin and soupy broth.  That said, while the broth is flavorful, I'd still prefer the variety over this beef one.  -- SHANG BEEF NOODLE SOUP - Beef Broth, Braised Beef Brisket, Veggies, and Choice of Noodles (Hand-pulled, Knife-shaved, Plain)...$8.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=C9pBFkDbuoidtVUp-XdrtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>) As tempting as their other noodle dishes looked, I knew I had to get this one the first time I came here.  Thankfully, it didn't disappoint!  Each piece of beef was both meaty and tender, the noodles had the perfect bite, and I loved the broth - so deep and robust!  -- PORK & CABBAGE POT STICKER (6 pieces)...$5.49 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=fzg_WZHMUKaGLe5YVvi51Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>) I may not have expected much out of this dish, but this was pretty good!  The potstickers were pleasantly plump, the skins were tender and only slightly thick, and the filling itself was rather tasty.  Plus, it had a good ratio of meat to cabbage.  Not bad!  -- PORK BELLY NOODLE - Pork & Chicken Broth, Braised Pork Belly. Veggies, and Choice of Noodles (Hand-pulled, Knife-shaved, Plain)...$8.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=wNvKKr_6FFHXzKwLMBN68Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>) Despite how the hand-pulled noodles seemed a little off this time around (knew I should've tried the knife-shaved one!), this was solid.  This broth wasn't quite as rich, but I LOVED the pork belly!  Not only was the portion quite generous, but every piece was huge and only slightly fatty.  Delish!  Even though my second trip here wasn't quite as amazing, I should also point out we were a bit tired of noodle soups when we came here (our two meals before this one were ramen).  For me, Shang is a fantastic spot and their beef noodle soup is well worth checking out.  With so many bookmarks to work my way through, I may not necessarily make it a point to come back.  But if the opportunity presented itself?  I'd never say no to that!  FOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now.",

And if we stay longer, we are going to go here more. Wish we\"lol have one in Boston:(  The Shang beef noodle is the best. We choose knife- carve noodle. Probably hand pulled noodle is also good, but my personal preference would always go with the knife-carve. The poem&cabbage fried dumplings is so good. Not only the meat and vegetables are fresh, but the taste and the soup within the dumplings is astonishing. They also have a self-made soy source to go with the dumplings.   Last but not least, the cleaness, the service are super.",

Both are great and you can choose based on your soup/style to eat the noodles. I prefer the thick noodle as. Stir fry or as a soup and the hand pulled are good in all applications.   the potstickers and a really good bottom with the crispies, however the skin was thicker and more boiled or steamed dumpling like so it was closer to a Zheng jian bao. It was still tasty!   The space is not too large and does get packed at busy times but there are seats also at the bar where you can see the noodles being made! Parking in the lot is free!",

Obviously this is not your fancy dinner place. What's make up for the small foot print is the amazing noodle. The beef broth is thick and delicious. Food can be very spicy here so make sure you ask your server if you can't handle the spices.  Not all items are great. I have tried the tan tan noodle and it was so salty and pricy. So if you are not familiar with Chinese cuisines, avoid fermented or oily/spicy item",

Then the pork pot stickers came out and it was like nothing I have experience yet, it was a 15 minute lead time by now I know why, it's made fresh to order and they make it with a slightly thicker dough then normal. We also got the steam white rice with tomatoes and scramble eggs. Then we got 2 soups with the hand cut noddles which you can watch them make on site.   Everything was great I can see how to make anything better, if this place was in the Wynn they could charge 3x the price but because they are in a strip mall I think it limits their pricing, this place is awesome!!!",

We tried five different things:  Spicey Wontons - good kick great flavor   Beef pancakes - tender and flavorfull meat / crisp outside soft inside Greta flavor   Beef & Onion dumplings - these were pretty good but a put on the over steamed side to me.   Shang Beef noodle (hand pulled)- I've had handpulled before at $$$ and these were so much better the broth has so much flavor and the meat is very soft and tender   Chicken chow mein (shaved noodles) - great great just great loved the full body flavor a tender Noddles and the chicken was perfect / Lee loved how the veggies are warm but crisp.   Service was great and we got lucky at 6 pm no wait to sit.   Worth the drive from the strip",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying this place. It's located in a small strip mall near the intersection of Flamingo and Decatur. Parking may be a bare because of limited spaces out front.  I came in the early afternoon and did not wait too long. The place is small but very quaint. There is table seating as well as bar seating. I sat at the bar which is directly in from the is the kitchen area. While you sit you can watch all these wonderful masterpieces come to life, especially as they make fresh hand pulled noodles.  The menu is simple and attacks just about every taste bud. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and Beef Pancakes. The Dan Dan was a good portion, but I should have order extra noodles (optional).  Very flavorful and spicy. It's not an immediate spice, I would call it a creeper. It gets you when you least expect it. The pancake was awesome, but be very careful, it's hot (temp).  And you have the potential of squirting juice (hot broth) everywhere. So I poked it first and let the juice run out into my spoon.   If you crave some fresh made noodles and a cozy atmosphere, I recommend you give this spot a try!  Happy eats.",

    "text": "I've been labeled a \"bad Asian\" for not eating rice regularly and instead choose to love noodles in its many forms. This place came highly recommended by my bestie. Perhaps it was that and the Yelp hype that is contributing to the a-ok review. Sorry bestie!  I will say that the service is extra friendly and complete with lots of smiles. This is appreciated as we were hungry and couldn't wait to be seated. There was a wait-list close to 9 pm but we were quickly seated in within 5-10 minutes.  We ordered the cucumber salad and the beef noodle soup with both hand-pulled noodles and knife-shaved noodles. - cucumber salad: cut-up cucumber with sesame sauce on top; doesn't require a lot of preparation and not what you'd typically expect. - beef noodle soup: the beef was tough and broth was salty. The noodles have a good texture but didn't integrate well with the broth. To me a critical component was missing from this dish, which is pickled sour mustard. It could be that this place is going for a \"modern interpretation\" but I wasn't a fan.",

More like seasoning for noodles, almost tasted a bit bland. Very interesting since it was my first time trying such a dish. I don't know if I would get it again. Beef pancakes were disappointing. Came out steaming hot so be careful if you're biting into it. It's very juicy however which was great. It would be good if the outer skin was a bit thinner.",

There was a good amount of People and luckily, we got the last table before a line started forming.   I ordered the Shang beef noodle soup and my bf ordered the tomato egg noodle. We also shared the spicy wontons for an appetizer. The Shang beef noodle was pretty good, I really enjoyed the soup. The meat was also pretty tender as well. The egg and tomato sauce noodle was just OK, it was a little bland to me and I also felt like I could've made it myself. The spicy wontons were pretty good as well, but I prefer my spicy wontons to have a bit of a peanut sauce/oil taste to it, so these were not the best spicy wontons I've had, in my opinion.  Overall the I enjoyed my Shang beef noodle soup the most. The service was also great. They refilled our water and tea and made sure that we were doing ok. They also helped store some of our luggage which was very nice of them!",

Glad there isn't any dessert otherwise I might have had to try it out; of course for everyone else's benefit. Lol  My server Lindsay; so sweet and so professional. More impressive was the fact she was so well versed in the food & the authenticity of it. You can see that it's a passion she has in the way she was speaking about it.

The best part of this place is that you can sit at the bar and watch them hand pull and make all the food in front of you! So cool and such a smart touch. They have ample choices from appetizers, noodles, and sauce noodles. I had the cucumber and beef shank as appetizers, shang's beef noodle soup and the pork belly noodles. They were all spot on and absolutely delicious. Their adaptation of childhood favorite dishes is a solid win. You can't go wrong with anything you order here and I'm excited to go back and try more of their food in the future.",

The water is scented with cucumber and feels ~fancy~ The noodle soup portions are quite large so consider sharing if you have a smaller appetite.    Spicy wontons - delicious spicy sauce. The wontons themselves are quite sweet.   Beef noodle with hand pulled noodles - the depth of flavor in this broth is unbelievable. So savory and an almost creamy texture! The hand pulled noodles are perfectly chewy and delicious.   Seafood soup with knife cut noodles - there are a TON of noodles in here, and since they are the knife cut variety, they are quite thick and filling. The broth is quite light, and there is a good amount of shrimp/squid/fish cake in here.   Highly recommend Shang noodle for a legit experience!",

You have a view of the kitchen staff pulling and methodically cutting noodles, and the sound of garlic being thrown into a wok. As long as there isn't some snotty kid running and screaming around, it's a fantastic small place. Beware of wait times, but it's a quick eats restaurant, so you shouldn't need to wait too long.  Service 5/5 nothing to complain about, nothing to laud about. It was just quick, short service. It's a type of customer service that especially matches the atmosphere of this noodle shop. Keep it up!   Food 4/5 so this is where the restaurant drops a star. The beef noodle soup with hand cut noodles is the best you'll get here. I've tried the black bean noodles, Dan Dan noodles, and more, but the beef noodle soup broth just can't be beat! The beef is also super tender. But the dropped star is mainly due to all the other menu items. The appetizers are nothing special, although it is nice that they're fairly priced. I feel like if they change up the way it's presented or change a bit of the recipe, the appetizers would be so much more delicious! This also applies for all the fried rices. Could be so much better but it's not \"bad.\" I would still order it but it just doesn't have that \"omg YUMM\" moment like the noodles or amazing dishes from other restaurants. But Shang has so much potential! It's so delicious, and I'd love to keep coming to see their improvements!!",

    "text": "I dragged my sister here because a) who doesn't love homemade noodles b) was tired of the Strip and their overpriced offerings. This place was a pleasant and tasty surprise. It's a small place located in a strip mall, but it's clean and bright. We got there right when it opened at 11 and it quickly filled up.   We started with the cucumber with peanut sauce. So crunchy and peanut sauce was not cloying sweet. I saw spicy homemade wontons and knew I had to get those. They were also very good, juicy little pillows of flavor in a spicy sauce. Our Shang beef noodle soup came out shortly. You can get your noodles three way: hand pulled, knife shaved and plain (vermicelli) style. I opted for the knife shaved as I love chewy al dente and noodles of different size and slight shape. The broth to the soup was rich with a beefy and slight tomato flavor. The crunchy baby bok choy was a good way to break up the slipperiness of the noodles. And the beef brisket was beyond tender. I liked their homemade hot chili sauce that I would dip my beef in.   The staff is very efficient, kind and helpful. If I lived in Vegas, I would come here probably once a week.",

    "text": "Yusi and I started w/ an order of the Spicy Wontons and for the main meal ordered the Shang Special Beef Brisket Soup w/ Hand-Pulled Noodles and the Chicken Mushroom w/ Hand-Shaven Noodles.  The Spicy Wonton sauce was a delicious balance of the soy base w/ vinegar tartness, fragrant sesame oil, and a good spicy back kick. We prevented our server from taking the bowl away and saved the remaining sauce for later.  I really love a good bowl of Beef Brisket Noodles, and count myself lucky there are several good varieties to be found in Seattle. But little did I expect to find this gem of a noodlery in Las Vegas with an amazing savory broth, tender morsels of beef brisket, and excellent noodles freshly hand-pulled on the spot. They had just the right firmness and girth with the slight random crookedness that confirmed their handmade nature with every slurp of the strands.  Yusi was craving chicken for some reason, and the Chicken Mushroom Noodles did not disappoint! I'm glad for her choice because it was a delicious counter point to the Shang Special: it was a dry \"lo mien\", loaded with chicken and two kinds of mushroom with a touch of scrambled egg in a delectable brown sauce. Folks who are familiar with Indonesian \"bak mie ayam\" would find this bowl tasting surprisingly familiar. Yusi ordered it with hand-shaven noodles, which was good, but I would have preferred it with the hand-pulled noodles instead.  Now for a surprise \"fourth\" dish we accidentally discovered: I pulled some of my hand-pulled noodles into the remaining bowl of Spicy Wonton sauce to let Yusi try the noodles, and she exclaimed with glee at how good that tasted! I took a slurp and enthusiastically agreed, adding more noodles into the Spicy Wonton bowl. They should consider adding a new menu item of Spicy Wonton Lo Mien Noodles! I'd fly back to Vegas just for that!  Leave some tummy time for after the spicy noodle goodness, to hop over next door to Sweet Boba for Boba milk tea or their Honey Toast dessert. I felt complete.",

Ofcourse China town!but with so many restaurants, I relied on yelp looking for a good place with great reviews so I end up here. However I was kinda disappointed. Why? This is not traditional Chinese food. It looks like it but it isn't. Let me say that the service was great! The noodle it self was good too but the over all cold noodle dish was not good.  Beef noodles soup was a weird bone white broth with slices of braised beef shank. Pot stickers fillings tasted weird...   So the overall experience is that this place seems to be an Americanized Chinese noodle place... it was not appealing to me but hey ... they got great reviews ... so give it a try and let me know! Enjoy!",

The broth on the noodle has so much flavor. Our server Steven was so helpful. He refilled our water as soon as it got low and boxed up our soup for us so we didn't spill it. The noodles are enough to share with two people. Also if you do hot tea they give you free refills. They have beer but not a full bar. The pot stickers were good but the wontons were better. Will definitely try it again.",

Sarah, the server was very helpful on the recommendations and describing the types of noodles they had. We ordered the Spicy Wonton, the beef brisket with hand pulled noodles, and the chicken and mushroom with hand pulled noodles. The spicy wontons were not that spicy, more on the mild side with just a kick and actually ends on a sweet note. There were about 10 small wontons that came in an order. I thought they would be a bit bigger, judging from the pictures posted on Yelp, but still good as a appetizer. Next up, the beef brisket was so tender and the broth was so flavorful. It was definately one of the best I've ever had. The chicken and mushroom did not have as much flavor as the beef brisket did but I just think it's because of the fact that mushrooms does not have a strong flavor. My dining experience here was great and would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas. YUM!",

I've been to many restaurants in China and this brings the best of the region into one menu.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  The noodles are everything one would hope for--especially the Knife Cut noodles.  Most everyone eating there had a connection to China--they all loved this place and were talking about it.  Even though several of the cooks were Mexican, they were well trained and fully committed to providing an authentic bowl of noodles--and really nice guys.  The cooks of Chinese decent \"owned\" it--you could tell they loved their work and had developed their skills over many many years.  The tea was great and had a unique twist.  I'm always looking at the details--the water was gently infused with lemon and cucumbers-delish!  And finally, the most important component of all--the broth--perfect!  Not too salty, not too strong, full flavor.  I wanted to jump in and swim around a bit, but that wouldn't hav'been appropriate although justified.",

    "text": "I won't change my ratings because I still think the food is great but I recently came back and they had a waitress that was obviously wasted. She knocked over 2 glasses of water on some customers then proceeded to spill my glass on another customer but gave it to me anyway. Then messed up every customers order and took her time too. I saw at least three groups of customers walk out because they waited too long. She also gave my credit card and bill back to another customer which luckily both the other and I were paying attention so I got it back from the other customer right away. It was so bad it was actually amusing to watch.  My point of updating is to help the management out. The manager came in about an hour later and tried to help her waitress (yes she was the only one). But what he should've done was let her go home or fire her because she kept making the situation worse. First impressions and service is super important and you can't afford to lose one customer over a stumbling drunk waitress. You already are understaffed I know but a bad waitress is worse than mediocre food. Your food is not mediocre so ditch the bad waitress and hire better people. Also there were three chefs in the back staring at her because she messed up all the orders. Some customer had to correct her 3 times and then finally just went and told the chef their order. Maybe you don't need 3 chefs when the one waitress they have can't take orders? Seriously they would've done better passing the iPad around and having the customers order their own food. Management, message me if you need more ideas. I want this restaurant to succeed because I do think you guys have a great concept going on.",

The bowl came out with the noodles nestled nicely in the bowl with nice big chunks of beef sticking out and three perfectly blanched pieces of baby bok choy. The noodles were nice and chewy with a bite to them, this was the most enjoyable part. The soup was okay, I've had better broth. I expect beef noodle soup to be a bit spicy but there's was not so I had to add a scoop of the chili oil. There could've been more depth to the flavor of the broth too but it was good with nice beef flavor. The spicy wontons were good but nothing very exciting.Several pieces of smallish wontons in a nice briny soy sauce with chili oil and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I left feeling satisfied so no complaints about the food. Only con would be that they have $10 minimum for credit cards. We were in a group and that made splitting the check a little difficult as we all paid with cards so some items were shifted around to meet their requirements.",

The staff are very friendly and efficient. At times they are overwhelmed with lots of customers and they do a great job.  Kudos to them.  Overall Shang's is my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this restaurant.  We ordered the wontons in chili oil, beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles and the Dan Dan noodles with hand pulled noodles.  The wontons were good but fairly small.  The sauce was great and I added it to the Dan Dan noodles because it was a little bland.  The beef noodle soup was just okay.  The broth was one dimensional and didn't leave a good, warm feeling that I usually get if the broth tastes rich and has been simmering for a long time.  We probably won't return since there are other noodle soup restaurants that are better.",

    "text": "Their interior decor is really cute and they try to be fancy by giving you cucumber infused water. However, I was not impressed with their dandan mien at all. It did not taste anything like the dandan mien I'm used to and love. At first I thought maybe the server brought me the wrong dish. I asked her if it was dandan mien since it didn't have any peanut taste and she said that it was. Maybe they make dandan mien differently where they came from but I'm not a fan. I also tried some of their Shang beef noodle and it's pretty good but it also tasted a lot like a Taiwanese instant beef noodle cup ramen that I used to have when I was young. They also flipped the potstickers upside down for presentation I suppose but all the precious juices inside flowed out since they either didn't seal them well or punctured them in the flipping process. Other than the dandan mien the food is not bad but I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Like sheep I watched everyone order the beef pancake becuase it was hyped on Yelp. Me included. Originally I had another noodle place in mind but my invited guest researched and came up with this one instead.  She had the cold chicken noodle ( $8) , I had the Peking Zha-Jiang hand tossed ( 8.50) We got there before the \"rush\"  and were served sporoctic but not long.  The noodle dishes arrived before the app. Mine was good, a mix of finely chopped veggies lay on top of the noodle. To be honest it was OK, there is a Pho place not far away and the Bon Thit Nuong , a similar dish, is far better, more grilled pork, more flavours and hot and cold in the dish.. My dinner friend added heaping spoons of hot sauce to get hers to the right temp. I have not been to many noodle houses so not much to compare to. My biggest beef is the beef pancakes. They were fat, like mini sliders and full of grease fat inside. 5 hours later I am still burping up the tatste of beef fat.  It is almost a dumpling, but poor executrion filling.  While I was there I watched sevral parties go on Yelp to determine what to order... I find that so wrong. There were a few other items on the menu I would have tried.",

Staff were nice and friendly. Make sure to check your bill. We were charged extra for an order that we had cancel right from the start but somehow it wasn't cancel on the bill, we handed our card without checking, after we signed the bill we noticed the extra item on it. It took them awhile to process the refund back. We haven't seen the credit on our statement so far, so hopefully it should be ok.",

Their Jia Jiang noodle is more on salty side but I like it when they serve with edamame.  Spicy wonton is really spicy! be careful.  Beef pancake is tasty too but not salty enough, need to add soy sauce for more flavor.  Great customer services, hope they will keep up the good quality!",

There was a pretty long wait in a small space. So having to stand inside because it is so cold outside is pretty uncomfortable.   We ordered Shang Beef Noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles and Boiled Beef dumplings. The soup was alright, but not the best. I wasn't really jumping out of my seat for the hand-pulled noodles.  I do have to give a shoutout for the homemade dumplings, though. They were amazing and are probably the best thing on the menu.   All in all, I think I would basically only go back for the dumplings. They are awesome and are the one thing that is worth your money.",

Put your name on the list, I suggest circling either to the option of table or bar. Doesn't really matter where you sit as the kitchen area is open & you can see the guy pulling the noodles from any seat.   You'll have to control yourself on how much you order because the noodle dishes are big enough to share.   Pork rib noodle soup had great flavor & the meat falls off the bone.. caution should be taken with the ribs as little bone fragments could break a tooth.   Dan-dan noodle dish was spicy.. a spicy level that sneaks up on you.. yet great flavor   Beef pancakes take 15 minutes but is worth the wait and you'll be served your noodle dish in the meantime so no big deal.. hot and juicy   They have bottled beverages and have hot water ready to serve for those who don't want iced.   Last night was freezing in Vegas and due to the lack of enough waiting area space was a bit overcrowded, blocking the doorway in or out..   If this place moved to a different location, it would be ideal to accommodate the many people who want to try it.. perhaps the empty restaurant next door ;)",

The boiled dumplings and spicy wontons are a great sharable appetizer. Id skip the cold sesame chicken noodles next time and go for their most popular noodle soups. The pork is Rich and fatty and the meat is soft and tender, almost gelatinous. The beef is soothing with a slightly spicy kick. I'll order the pork noodle soup next time cuz I enioyed the texture of the pork belly and just add hot chili from the condiment jar to combat the rich flavor. Clean and modern ambience. A new favorite to nurse hangovers! I still prefer the beef noodle soup at Noodle Pot for the tendon but the dumplings here were better along with the service.",

    "text": "Shang Artisan Noodle is located in a plaza that is near McDonald's, specifically next door to Sweet Box with parking available.   My husband and I decided to grab a late lunch on Monday, Christmas Eve around 3:45 pm. I walked in and saw a sign in sheet and placed my name on it. Wait time for a table was about 10 minutes and then were seated at a 4 seated table by the window. After looking over the menu, we ended up ordering:  Cucumber Salad, $4.99 prior to tax- refreshing pieces of cucumber pieces, ample amount to share with 2 people. A savory peanut sauce adores the fresh cucumber pieces.   Pork Belly Noodle, $9.95 prior to tax- My husband ordered this, with hand pulled noodles. There was a good amount of tender pieces of beef in this, but he would have liked more. Since my husband was sick I only got a little bit of his food before he took a bite. I thought the hand pulled noodles had a good chew to it and the broth was good. The small bite of pork I got was good.   Chicken Sesame Cold Noodles, $8.75 prior to tax- This large dish is a great portion for 2 people to share. This came with shredded chicken, carrots, cucumber and bean sprouts. The sauce this entree comes with is the same savory peanut sauce that was on the cucumber salad. I picked the noodles to be knife cut because I like really chewy noodles. Mix all the elements together, makes for a very satisfying meal.  Hot Tea, $1.95, prior to tax- For the sick husband. Comes with free refills. ---------------------- (Total= $27.76 after tax, prior to tip)  Overall, a pretty tasty meal. Really could feed another person or 2 so the price is fair with the large portions. This restaurant reminds me of a noodle house back at home called Noodle St (Monrovia and Fullerton, in Southern California) where you can pick your preference of thickness for the noodles.   Great meal options, would come here again.  By the way, there is free WiFi at this restaurant and the employees here speak English and Mandarin. So ordering shouldn't be a problem.  Also the ladies restroom (single toilet) was clean and adequately stocked with the essentials upon this visit.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of hand pulled noodles so I was really excited to try this place out.  We stopped by around 7pm with a party of 7 and was seated after about a 20 minute wait.   The decore was basic, clean, and very typical of decent noodle places. You can see into the kitchen and watch them make noodles, which is always fun.  We got spicy wontons and beef pancakes as appetizers. I strongly recommend the beef pancakes. They were juicy and flavorful. I would get the spicy wontons again if I go back, they were good but unmemorable.  I ordered the seafood knife cut noodles and I tasted all the food the rest of my party ordered so I got a good sense of what I liked here.  As much as I love hand pulled noodles, the knife cut noodles were definitely better. I prefer my noodles chewier and thicker (which is why I ordered hand cut in the first place -- after looking at the noodles on other tables). The hand pulled noodles were okay, I didn't think they were chewy enough and were over cooked for my taste. Someone in my group did find my hand cut noodles too al dente for his preference but conceded that they were overall better.  The seafood noodle broth was plainer than I like, you can taste the pepper but that's about it. I ended up pouring the left over chili oil from the spicy wontons into my soup and that made it way better.  A lot of the noodle dishes tasted fusion instead of authentic but the quality of the hand cut noodles definitely make up for it. I particularly enjoyed the chicken and mushroom noodles because the sauce was very different from the rest of the dishes.  Over all this place definitely satisfied my noodle craving. They use quality ingredients to create a taste that was just a tad bit more Americanized than I expected from an authentic looking Asian noodle place.",

Spicy lovers.... brace yourself for a HOT Dan Dan noodle that will indulge your taste buds while rising your spice tolerance to the next level. I'd suggest adding the Spicy Wonton appetizer on top of thay as well. Yes, they are both spicy.   Non-spicy lovers... the pork belly noodle soup is a great option. Be prepared for an awesome broth to accompany your juicy pork belly and amazing hand-pulled noodle.",

The noodles are chewy, perfectly cooked, and go so well with the soup. The soup was also very delicious. The broth was very flavorful and not too salty or oily. The meat was the only downfall as it was very chewy and hard to get through. But seriously get this!!  Dan Dan noodles ($8.95) - I got these with hand pulled noodles. I really liked the texture of the noodles. They were also cooked to perfection. However the sauce was a little disappointing and lacked flavor. It was very low key.   Spicy wontons ($5.95) - just ok. Don't think I'd order it again.   Service - was awesome!!! Everyone is super nice   There is a waitlist but the wait isn't too bad (at least not when I went on Thursday around 4ish)",

    "text": "A random Lyft driver recommended Shang Artisan Noodle to me while I was in town, and I was not disappointed. When I walked in, I was greeted by a view of one of their chefs animatedly working on preparing hand-pulled noodles, a show that would repeat in the background throughout the visit. It was quite mesmerizing to watch, and provided some entertainment for the wait (which in my case wasn't too bad, but I think my party got there just on time because as soon as we were seated, a line began to form outside).  I ordered their signature dish, the Shang Beef Noodle with hand-pulled noodles--I didn't want waste the chef's efforts--and it easily lived up to the hype! The noodles were perfect, and the beef and broth were both delicious. But my favorite part of the experience was a side order of spicy wontons! These were really special; the flavor was incredible, and the level of spiciness was just right for my tastes. I also got to try the cucumber salad, which was flavored with a pleasant sesame sauce.  All in all, the food was wonderful, and unlike many of the usual options in Las Vegas, Shang Artisan Noodle is not overpriced. To the contrary, their prices are downright reasonable! It ended up being the least expensive and most enjoyable meal of my entire Vegas trip! It just goes to show that you don't have to spend a ton of money to have an amazing dining experience in Las Vegas if you know where to go. Give Shang Artisan Noodle a try!",

Be prepared for a wait, because obviously this place is delicious.  We got there around 11 and probably didn't get sat til 12, but it was also because of our large party.  I felt like I ordered everything I possibly could bc everything looked so good.  Spicy noodles, Dan Dan noodles, and also their signature Shang Beef noodles with knife cut noodles.  Keep in mind, there's definitely a spice kick if you see that pepper sign on there.  I have quite a tolerance, so it was a bit on the spicier side for me, but still SO SO GOOD.  Definitely a must stop when I'm in Vegas now.",

Upon walking in, you're welcomed into an average-sized seating area with a bar where you can watch the chefs hand pull the noodles. Definitely try to sit near the bar because it's very amusing watching them hand pull the noodles they make for you!  My boyfriend and I ordered the spicy wontons and hand-pulled shang beef noodle. The wontons were so delicious and were nice to snack on while we waited for our noodles. We each ordered a bowl of the shang beef noodles, but my boyfriend ordered and extra side of noodles. In retrospect, we probably wouldn't have ordered the extra noodles because the serving they give you is more than enough.  Our waitress was excellent and food was amazing! Definitely satisfied my soup cravings for the day.",

I went on a Friday night around 7:30 and it was packed. The waiting list was long. Waited for about an hour but it was worth it!   It's a small shop where you can watch the people make the noodles. So it's a fun date area if you go off peak hours where the wait time is shorter.   For an appetizer, I ordered the beef pancake. I ordered Dan dan noodles with knife shaved noodles and also the Shang beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.   I definitely recommend the hand pulled noodles unless you like very thick noodles (like knife shaved).  The portions and prices were fitting.   For the beef pancakes, learn from my mistake and use the knife to cut it into halves before you eat it lol. Or you will get an explosion on the opposite end of where you Bit into. I obviously didn't learn my lesson because it exploded twice on me but I smelled deliciously like soup after.   I preferred the Shang beef soup noodle over the Dan Dan noodles, which I felt were a little dry. The Shang beef was delicious!!!!! So flavorful and rich.",

The kitchen is open and you can see someone hand-pulling them near a viewing window situated right at the bar seating.  I came for an early dinner at 5pm, so I experienced absolutely no wait. I ordered a *Beef Shank Noodle* soup with hand-pulled noodles and added some wontons to the soup along with *pork and cabbage boiled dumplings* on the side. Broth to the soup was quite hearty, not too oily, and maybe a little too salty for my liking. Still enjoyable nonetheless! Noodles were perfection and they give you SO much of it. Beef shank pieces were also plentiful and ultra tender. The bok choy that comes in the soup were crunchy and well cooked. Wontons were larger than I was expecting for this type of establishment and were so well wrapped. The dumplings surprisingly stayed together pretty well even though they were boiled. Yummy and scrumptious especially with the vinegary soy sauce they recommend to have them with.   This certainly was a delicious, hassle-free meal to have off the Strip. I was traveling solo, so I appreciate that Vegas has other good eats that are more accessible.",

Since I was feeling a bit under the weather the day I came in, I decided to order something clean and light. I order the wonton soup and added extra wontons ($2) and bok choy and no noodles. The service was fairly quick and portions were sufficient. I definitely was full from my soup!   The wonton soup broth was clean and delicious. Very flavorful. The wontons had good enough filling and seasoned well. I will come again to try their other soup noodle dishes.",

    "text": "I just discovered this noodle place near my house. I decided to try it for a casual birthday dinner, and it was delicious! The service was great (very friendly waiters) and the atmospehere was welcoming and tranquil with modern decor. It's rather small inside (maybe 4 or 5 small tables and a row of stools at the counter), so it's not ideal for large groups. I got the spicy wontons as a starter and the chicken and mishroom noodles as my main meal. Both were excellent! Everyone in my family enjoyed their meal. I especially loved the chicken and mushroom dish  The portions were great (everyone took a doggy bag!), and the prices were low. I'll definitely go back! The only reason behind the \"4\" score is because I've had some outstanding noodles elsewhere (especially in NYC) that really nailed it on flavor. But this is a great spot in Vegas!",

    "text": "For my quick stint in Vegas, this was the place I was most excited to try.  A handmade noodle place in Vegas serving beef noodle soup?  I couldn't wait!  We arrived at around 11:30am and waited for 15 minutes for seats at the bar.  We had a perfect view for the noodles being made and the potstickers being wrapped.  We started with the spicy wontons, which were pretty average.  They're exactly as you'd expect them to be.  I actually would have preferred if they were a bit more spicy.  We also got the beef pancakes, which are essentially \"sheng jian bao\", except a little flatter.  An order comes with four and each one was generous in filling.  They were fried to a nice golden brown.  The strange thing was that the order came with a knife and the waitress said to cut them in half to let the juice out since otherwise it'll squirt out as you bite it.  I disagree.  The whole point is to eat this juicy pan-fried bun and not let the greasy goodness end up on the plate.  Eat these like you would a xiao long bao.  Hold it in your spoon, bite the top open, suck out the broth, and keep eating.  For noodles, we went with the Shang's beef noodle and the pork belly noodle, both with knife-shaved noodles.  Both were good, but the beef noodle was the better of the two.  The broth was so complex and rich, with a great beefy flavor.  The braised beef brisket was tender and plentiful.  The pork belly noodle broth was a bit muddled and required some hot oil to \"brighten\" it up a bit.  The noodles were delicious, with a really nice texture to them.  We also got the zha-jiang noodle which was, surprisingly, my favorite dish today.  It came with carrots, cucumber, and edamame to mix with the nice rich sauce.  We went with the hand-pulled noodles this time and they were so perfectly \"QQ\".  The staff were all really friendly.  There was a huge line waiting outside, but you never felt rushed.  They were attentive and often asked how we were doing or if we needed more hot water for our tea.  The MVP of this place was the guy making the noodle.  He's a beast in the kitchen.  He went between pulling noodles, shaving noodles, warming up bowls, portioning noodles, and helping on the finishing line.  He was constantly busy and was the reason food was coming out of the kitchen so quickly and consistently.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  I'd like the knife-shaved noodles to be a bit broader and a bit thicker.  The noodles were great at the start, but quickly got a bit soggy.  I usually prefer knife-shaved noodles to hand-pulled because knife-shaved noodles are thick enough to not get soggy.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case here.",

We didn't have to wait an unreasonably long time and plus there's a boba place next door so there was something to do while we waited. When we put our name on the waitlist, another customer overheard us talking about the food and let us know we absolutely HAD to order the spicy wontons. Once we were sat, we ordered those, beef and onion pot stickers, cucumber salad, pork belly noodles, and beef shank noodles. I did not personally try the spicy wontons but everyone else absolutely loved them. Another definite standout was the cucumber salad; I would absolutely come back to order this again. The noodles were good but very filling and I wish it had something other than just meat and bok choy, maybe some other vegetables or an egg? Overall our meal was good and it was very modestly priced especially considering the noodles and the portion we got.",

I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend right when they opened and it was already packed! It slowed down after 1pm. They have a cool set up with a L-shaped bar where you can watch the chefs cook and hand make the noodles behind the glass.  We ordered the popular meat cakes and it did not disappoint! The breading was just right, with juicy meat inside, very filling. Totally worth it to order! Ordered the pork dumplings, and it had a thick dough exterior. The pork inside was good but the dumpling could of been hotter (as in heat). This was the only miss for me. Beef noodle soup was great! Tasty broth, and very tender beef that was just as flavorful. I will be again to try the other noodle soups!",

Food: 4  Pork Rib Noodles with Knife Shaved Noodles: The ribs were cooked perfectly. They had the right amount of seasoning and were super tender. I wasn't a fan of the broth. Because it's supposed to be a chicken and pork based broth, I thought it would be lighter, but it was as dark and heavy as traditional beef noodle soup.  Chicken Chow Mein with Hand Pulled Noodles: The dish was a tad too oily and salty, but it was pretty tasty. The chicken wasn't dry and it had great flavors.  * Note: Knife shaved noodles are thicker and chewier than hand pulled noodles.  Service: 4  The servers were really nice, attentive, and super patient with all of our questions. Food came out pretty fast too.  Ambiance: 5  The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, and there's plenty of parking. Although the strip mall is not the nicest looking, the restaurant is very nice on the inside. It's modern, well-lit, and clean. Customers have the choice to sit at the counter or table, but all seats will afford some view of the open kitchen. If you really want to see the cooks in action and noodles being made, I definitely recommend sitting at the counter!",

You can see into the kitchen to watch your meal being prepared and watch the chef make the noodles by hand, which is pretty cool.  Service-very good service, you keep your drinks full and continually ask if you need anything else. All they're employees seem to like working there, I guess that's why it's so good.  Food-It was fantastic! The pot stickers were amazing to start with, become of this flower shaped looking thing with crispiness on the bottom and nice to see me on the inside. The spicy Won Ton's were also very good and very well-made. They had just the right amount of spice and acidity, and the meat and the inside was awesome perfectly seasoned and cooked. Shang's Beef Noodle really hit the spot for me. I wasn't feeling too well and the hot broth with beef and noodle really hit the spot.   I really enjoy dining here, and look forward to coming back.",

Our total bill was about $61, that included beers and a Coke. A great value, and we have leftovers!  Our menu consisted of: Cucumber Salad  Pork and cabbage potstickers   Pork and cabbage dumplings   Spicy wontons   Wonton soup   The signature fried rice   Chicken chow mein   The only problem is that when I come back I want to order all of the same items and I know that their other food is amazing.  There was a short wait about 20 minutes to get in, well worth the wait!  The service was prompt and extremely friendly. We can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "DAY:  - Sunday night dinner for party of 4. There was no wait but the counter/bar was the only open seating, which was fine with us since we wanted to see the noodle being made.   LOCATION/INTERIOR:  - located in the Flamingo Decatur Plaza (off strip).  - parking is pretty limited in the center but didn't have a problem finding a spot.  - restrooms are very clean and have separate ones for men and women.  ORDER & TASTE: * For noodle dishes you can choose: hand-pulled noodles (longer and thin), knife-shaved noodles (more short, wide, and chewy), or plain noodle.   - Dan Dan Noodle with hand-pulled noodles ($7.99): liked it but was slightly saltier than I would have liked it. On the menu it says hot for the dis being spicy. It had a kick to it as I kept on eating it. It will depend on your tolerant if you think it's spicy or not.  - Beef Shank Noodle with knife-shaved noodles ($8.95): the soup is very light and simpler, I liked the soup flavor, more of a simple flavor, but would have liked the soup a little more (temperature) hot.  - Pork Belly Noodle with knife-shaved noodles ($8.95): I thought some of the pork belly was slight more dry but overall it was good. The soup is dark and is more the typical \"beef noodle soup\". Was good.   - Cucumber Salad ($4.95): this is a plate of cucumbers with sesame sauce. I was not a fan of the sesame sauce. I would not get it again.   - Pork and cabbage potstickers 6pcs ($5.49): the potstickers have a skirt! It has a crispy skirt when it is cooked. When you bite into it, you will get the juicy soup. It's delicious!  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  - servers were polite and friendly.   - attentive: I drink a lot of water and really appreciate when service is attentive and refills. They were definitely on point for that.",

    "text": "I really do not want to write this review...I was expecting to write another glowing review of this establishment. I was so disappointed with the entire experience tonight. I went expecting the same type of experience and great food that I had last time and it came nowhere near that.   1) the A/C was not really working or they had it up really high.... Not sure what was going on but it was really warm...I mean like in the mid 80's. They did have a fan going BUT it was just blowing the hot air around. So I was just looking forward to getting my food and getting out ASAP.  2) My bf and I went in a little before 9pm.... Was greeted right away and sat right away. Started off good right?? I ordered the beef and onion potstickers after seeing the pictures and reading some of the other reviews. And of course the spicy wontons. I was warned that it would take 10-15 minutes which is why I ordered those first before ordering my noodles. And True to the warning it took that long.... My bf and I ate the apps.... And if you look at my pictures... My beef and onion potstickers look nothing like the other pictures... Mine came out kind of burnt in some areas and the Lacey look that is supposed to be on these potstickers were nowhere to be found. The flavor was ok... Kind of bland and it tasted a little off like the mix in them were on their last legs. :( (1/5) I was thinking oh well... At least the spicy wontons won't disappoint me...as soon as I took my first bite...I wanted to cry... They did NOT taste the same as last time. Same as the filling in the potstickers... It tasted like the meat mixture was also on is last legs as well.... And the sauce was a watered down version of what I had last time. Such a disappointment!!! (2/5)  3) I was hoping that the noodles that I ordered would make up for the disappointment with the apps. Nope... It only took my bf and I about 10 minutes to eat the apps. Then the wait started. My noodle dish came out finally at 9:40pm... That was almost a 20 minute wait. 3 tables that were sat after me got their apps and entrees all before my Noodle dish. I was like WTH???  And the broth of my braised pork dish was delicious!!! And that's where anything good about the dish ended. The braised pork which should just melt in your mouth was tough and chewy... The fat was not rendered all the way and the meat was just tough. Boo!! They are known for their noodles and the knife cut was hugely disappointing. It did not have a great chew that you would expect. It was like they almost undercooked the noodles. The noodles were very gummy and almost just disintegrated in my mouth. It was not a great feeling. I kept on eating the noodles trying to figure out what was wrong with them.   Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. If this had been my first visit I would've probably given them 2 stars but I'm going to give them another try in the future to see if I just got them on an off night.",

    "text": "TLDR: hand-pulled noodles; no card payment under $10; infused tap water; hit or miss service  I have had this bookmarked for quite some time and waited until a return visit before I gave a review. I came for a lunch on a weekday exactly at 12noon and was surprised to see only 1 other customer, as this place can get packed.   The first time I dined here, I was greeted with excellent service and the server explained what infusion the water was that day. On my most recent visit, I don't even think she knew what was infused in the water; however, no information was given.   Because I only had a card on me, I had to make sure that I ordered something over $10. I opted for the seafood bowl with hand-pulled noodles. The order came promptly within 5 minutes as there were no other customers.   On previous occasions, I have dined with friends and ordered the tomato and egg fried rice and and have seen the dumplings. The size of the dumplings were perfect and were definitely made in-house. The fried rice was interesting and definitely meant as a side dish.   I love the size of the seafood bowl as well as the seafood ingredients. There were good-sized prawns with calamari and slices of a fish roll. The chili oil pleasantly accompanied the dish to improve the dish without taking away from its original flavor. The noodles were chewy and delightful. The broth was almost creamy and was good to the last drop.   I was disappointed with the service and attentiveness of the server. Although she was busy with other tasks and with only 1 other table at this point of my meal, I often had to flag her down to get water refills and other needs. It was funny, however, that she was quick to get my bowl even though I wasn't finished. This is probably just a training issue. Regardless of the hit or miss service, I'm willing to return because he food is that good.",

I got the wonton soup with hand pulled noodles, which has a pork and chicken soup base, and it was so good. The staff was really nice and it was taking a while for my dish to get out so they gave me one of their appetizers for free because of the wait and I swear my boyfriend and I didn't say anything about the wait cause we were having a good time and didn't really care about the wait, they decided to do that for us all on their own. I'll definitely be going back soon.",

    "text": "My favorite Beef Noodle soup of ALL TIME!  I was in Vegas for the weekend and was craving some beef noodle soup and came across Shang. I was amazed by the noodle options they had because a lot of place do not have fresh knife cut noodles. I live in LA and was never able to find a memorable Taiwanese knife cut noodle restaurant. That being said, I was so excited to try this place out. The first time I came here, there was a short wait since it was a Sunday afternoon. Luckily, we got a seat at the bar and was able to watch the amazing workers make our order fresh. We ended up trying the Shang Beef knife-cut Noodle, Beef Shank noodle, and Spicy Wontons. The Shang Beef Noodle was amazing. Everything from the texture of the chewy noodles to the flavorful beef broth deserves a solid 5 stars. The spicy wontons were pretty yummy as well, but it is a little on the spicy side. I would say it is considered medium spicy for all those that can't handle spicy. I came on a second time a few months later and also tried their Shang Fried Rice and that tasted great as well! It kind of reminded me a little of Din Tai Fung's fried rice for all my LA friends that love DTF.   All in all everything was amazing, the quality of food to the customer service. I ended up placing an addition two Beef noodle soup orders to take back with me to LA, that is how much I love this place. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas or those that live nearby!",

Lupita was our server - charming, knowledgeable and efficient.  This is True \"comfort food\" for those who appreciate fresh noodles.  We ordered the beef shank noodle (tender beef) and pork belly noodles (nice and fatty). Delicious broth, too.  Beef pancakes were crispy, juicy and hot (don't burn your tongue!). We also ordered food to go which look so beautiful in their to-go containers.  Can't wait for dinner!",

The tomatoes and eggs noodles was ok. Noodles at the bottom were too dry. It was because there was no sauce from the tomatoes and eggs...but I think it would be better if they put a little bit more water? Also, if you don't like scallions like me, remember to let them know in advance. I think they put scallions in all types of noodles.",

The wonton my boyfriend devoured. He liked it sweet. The beef soup was very tasty(we added a little chili oil). It came w beef, your choice of noodle style and 2 bok choys. The beef was fatty. Which was yum for me but I know it's not for everyone. Usually my boyfriend doesn't like fat but everything was gone when we were done eating. It was very yummy and those 3 things was about $20 and we are full. Will come back",

    "text": "The closest comparison to this restaurant is The Noodle Man off of Rainbow and 215, and this is better.  With a few hiccups that could be resolved, this place could receive a 5 star rating in my book.  This place has a lot of potential.  The prices are reasonable, right around where they should be.  Sub $5 appetizers are great (albeit a bit small).  We ordered family style so we could try a little bit of everything.  The size and shape of the restaurant is almost identical to The Noodle Man, but the layout is a bit different but it seats roughly the same amount of people.  There's a glass window for you to watch the chefs pull noodles and you can rest assured, your noodles are fresh in every bowl.  I also believe we had a chef in training preparing our food.  I saw him pulling noodles and having issues with it (caucasian chef).  He then asked another chef (perhaps a managing chef?), \"why are my noodles falling apart? Maybe it needs more water.\"  The other chef tells him he will take a look at it later.  He then responds saying, \"I'll see if I can save some of this.\"  I don't think they noticed I was listening, but these are not words I want to hear as a customer.  Clearly there's an issue with the noodles and we as consumers do not want some salvaged noodles.  I had a couple of issues with the sauces provided.  I was told by the waitress that the white container was soy sauce and the red container was chili oil.  I smelled the bottle openings and told her that the white bottles were vinegar, not soy sauce.  She took them away and replaced them and said the new ones were soy sauce.  One bottle was soy sauce and one was still vinegar.  She explained that the white containers used to contain vinegar but have now all been switched to soy sauce.  This sounds like a clientele preference, rather than an authenticity choice.  All of their items should be served with vinegar and I think that should be a default item on the table, rather than something that should be requested.  Personally, I prefer a concoction mix of vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil.  The waitress explained that perhaps I was mistaken and that because their soy sauce is made in house, it almost tastes like vinegar.  Spicy Wonton - This is one dish that is better at The Noodle Man.  This was bland, it wasn't spicy at all.  The wonton itself was good, but I didn't expect to have to load it with flavor.  Beef and Onion Potsticker and Pork and Cabbage Potsticker - I've grouped these together because they both had great flavor, and it's a matter of what kind of filling is your preference.  My issue with both of these is that the skin wasn't crispy on the bottom like it should be.  The flavor was great.  If they could pan fry the skin to the correct texture, I would order these every time.  Perhaps an error by the chef in training?  I'm sure the boiled would be tasty.  If given the option, I always prefer pan fried (potsticker) because of the texture and it's always much more fragrant and I start salivating at the sight and smell.  Beef Pancake - Again, delicious filling.  These were a bit crispier but there was one major flaw.  The dough wasn't cooked in the inside because where they tuck the dough in the center to create this flat look from the folded flap, the dough is thicker and therefore was not cooked and partially raw.  Because food was piling on, we didn't notice until towards the end of the meal and we showed the waitress and she was all over it.  She gave us the option for a new order or to take it off the check, but we were all full by that time and opted not to have a new order prepared.  I know, this review doesn't seem very positive but I think all of these issues are easily correctable.  We're about to get into the highlights of the meal.  Shang Beef Noodle - This to me was the highlight of the meal.  The broth was perfectly balanced.  It was tasty, not too salty and had a slight subtle heat.  The brisket was prepared as it should be, but I wouldn't have minded a few more pieces.  I ordered this with the hand pulled noodles and they were a great compliment.  I would be very happy if I ordered just this bowl and nothing else.  Pork Belly Noodle, Pork Rib Noodle and Dan Dan noodles are on the list of things to order the next visit.  Lan-Zhou Noodle - This was a decent choice, but reminiscent of that bowl you want on a rainy day when you are down with the cold.  It was much less \"flavorful\" and not my top choice.  The clear beef bone broth had the flavor that reminded me off my parents beef bone soup growing up.  We also ordered these with the hand pulled noodles.  I'd like to try the knife shaved noodles in some sort of noodle soup (broth) on my next visit.  Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle - This was another highlight of the meal.  The flavor was excellent and well balanced. We ordered these with the knife shaved noodles.  I think these were a great compliment giving the noodles a great texture.  Don't hesitate to give this place a try!",

We ordered a few more stuff-scallion pancake, ... They are all very good. What a pleasant surprise for me. The only downside is that I have drive 30 minutes to get there from my house.

Like other reviews have stated, it is not spicy. (Thank goodness because I can't handle spicy!) However, there is hot sauce on the table if you would like to kick it up a notch!  Service is always friendly. Water is refilled often. (Not to mention flavored! This time it had a refreshing cucumber taste.) Food has always been quickly brought out.

Beef noodle flavor and broth was great but I would've loved some pickle on the side as it traditionally has. Potsticker and beef pancake weren't too exciting. The pancake was a little too doughy for my taste. Like I said, I had high expectations and I've definitely had better.

We were quickly seated at the bar(got there just on time as a big crowd came in afterwards and had to wait). We asked Steven what he recommended and it was the Shang beef noodle soup and the pork belly noodle soup; so that's what we got. You're able to choose between 3 variations of noodle styles: handmade, knife shaven, and original. All I can say is that after trying both, I could've gotten either one once again. The service was 5 stars, the food was 5 stars.   P.S. if you sit at the bar you're able to watch the chefs make noodles from scratch.   P.S.S. Also get the beef pancakes a.k.a dumplings. They're bomb",

We ordered a variety of noodles and starters. The knife cut noodles were my favorite, great texture with the perfect chewiness. I prefer to order a side of the knife cut noodles so it doesn't lose its texture from the soup. The hand pull noodles were also quite good. The spicy wontons were a tad too spicy for me, but the flavor of the meat in the wontons were spot on. The cucumber salad was a very refreshing start to the meal. It definitely helped cut the heaviness of the carbs thru out the meal. The beef pancake and pork dumplings were average, the hand made skin was the best part. All in all a very solid 4 star experience.",

With a quaint, comfortable ambiance and a super transparent noodle-making process, you'll feel like you're dining in a soup shop in China!  We tried the pork and cabbage dumplings, the spicy wontons and a generous sized bowl of their signature beef noodle soup. The pork and cabbage dumplings were somewhat bland, though perfectly rolled and much better with the included sauces. The spicy wontons were pillow-like, tender and delicious, though a bit spicy to be sure.   My favorite, however, was by far the shang beef noodle bowl. I went for the knife shaved and boy was I happy. For starters, the incredible wooden soup spoons and quality chop sticks really make you enjoy your meal in superb fashion. The broth is super rich and meaty with just a hint of spice and tender chunks of delicious beef. The noodles are so unbelievably soft yet still with a good amount of substance. The green onion and bok choy serve to add some nice texture and additional flavor contrast.   I came back just a couple days later for some takeout and was just as impressed with their timeliness, friendliness and the quality of the food.  Apparently they sell their wood spoons, which I fully intend to pick up next time I'm there! 5 stars.",

I really like the open air concept where you can see the kitchen prepare your meal and to showcase their noodle making skills.  This is much like the pizzeria tossing the pizza dough in the air.  Almost all dishes are around $8 range and quite affordable with decent portions.  You can order extra noodles for just over a buck more and is worth it if you hungry.  The beef shang noodles hand cut was the best dish we had for the night.  The beef was extremely tender and the broth had a very deep beef flavor.  The hand cut noodles was more evenly cut than I thought, so we'll try the knife cut it next.  Noodles were cooked perfectly.  The spicy won tun appetizer was a bit too sweet and not much of a spicy flavor.  This was so so.  The dan dan noodles again was a bit too sweet and wasn't much of a spicy flavor.  Their version doesn't have a peanut component.  I would recommend to explore their menu to find your favorites.",

Now a must try is the Beef Buns ( omg ) so good!! The dumplings are pretty good and the vinegar sauce they have for it makes them even more tasty.

The braised beef was so tender and delicious. Went with the chicken chow mein staple. But those noodles!! I just couldn't get enough. I was so happy with the meal. It hit the spot. Looking forward to coming again.",

We also tried the following: Cucumber Salad - it's good if you are looking for something cooling Pork and Cabbage Pot stickers - Very good. my kids enjoyed it.  Spicy Wontons - So So Good we ordered a 2nd one. The sauce has the right amount of spiciness and the wonton is cook just right.  Beef Pancakes - It's super juicy inside. Have to be careful when you eat it coz the broth inside the buns is really HOT (temperature wise) . A MUST EAT!  After  Six very happy satisfying stomachs, We are even happier with the bills. The price is really affordable for great authentic cook to order quality food.   Customer service - the service is great. All the staff are friendly and help one another out.   Will definitely come back again when visiting Vegas!",

    "text": "\"Live long and prosper\" - Mr. Spock  Fresh Knife Shaved Noodles! Shang Artisan Noodles gets a lot of video love for their Hand Pulled Noodles, and rightfully so...it's fun to watch, but Knife Shaved Noodles is actually where it's at for toothsum noodles that offer great taste and wonderful texture as you bite in.   My love and I met a couple friends here and certainly enjoyed what Shang's was offering. We tried the Chicken and Mushroom Noodles, Shang's Beef Noodle Soup, Peking Zha-jiang Noodles, Beef Pancake, and Spicy Wontons.   My favorite was the Chicken and Mushroom Noodles. I love the deep earthly flavors and the sauce is a perfect portion for noodle absorption.   I also greatly enjoyed the Beef Pancake...though, as others have noted, it is much more of a round pan fried dumpling or potsticker on steroids than an Asian Pancake. Not all Beef Pancakes are created equal. Shang's are as juicy as they come. In fact, as you wrap your lips around these beefy pancakes and ever-so seductively bite in, you may, without trying, squirt flavorful juice across the table...perhaps in your neighbors food, on their clothes, or in their eye. ...anyway, all that to say; eat carefully. After all, with great power comes great responsibility.   Shang's Beef Noodle Soup is a popular item. I am probably not the best one to hear from. This is not a dish that I typically like very much at other places...and while Shang's is better then average, it was not my favorite dish of the evening.  I am somewhat of a connoisseur of spicy wontons however, and I was saddened to bite into Shang's. They are not that spicy and do not carry the same flavors that the best versions of this appetizer often do in other Vegas establishments.  In the end, Shang Artisan Noodle is one of the best spots in town for fresh noodles. I am ready to come back and try some of their other dishes.",

What is special about this place is that their noodles are all freshly handmade. You have the option of ordering hand-pulled, knife-cut noodles, etc per order.  The pork belly was delicious and I liked the broth. However, I preferred the brisket in the Shang noodle soup as it was more flavorful and the broth was much richer. The spicy wontons though were really good. One of the best I've ever had. It's not \"spicy\" but it does have a little heat with sweetness to it.  Prices are great! Service is good. Credit cards accepted. Plenty of parking. I'd definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Sometimes, it's not just the food and service, it's how a business handles an honest problem.  Get a soda now, this is a long one.  While working in LV, a couple of us decided to try Shang's based on the yelp reviews.  We hit them right at the lunch rush and were seated at the bar. There were no tables as the smallish seating area was completely full.  The waitress got us menus and then went back to working the tables.  She was very busy and simply didn't get back to us.... When the party of three that came in the same time we did (and got the last table) was served their food, I messaged the restaurant and was informed that one of their staff was late; we watched our new waiter roll in about that time and the original waitress came back and took our order (IMMEDIATE response to my message).  The best thing about this was watching the kitchen staff making noodles and preparing the food; pretty interesting process.  I ordered pork potstickers and the seafood noodles.  My friend ordered the pork back bacon noodles.  Our noodles came very quickly (the post stickers were supposed to take 15 minutes...).  Initial impression was the noodles were undercooked so I tried the broth and seafood.  Both were excellent; best fishcake since I lived in Japan.  After about 5 minutes, I tried the noodles and they had cooked to perfection in the broth.  I don't like over cooked, over soft noodles; these were excellent.  Did I mention the broth was very good?  My friends comments on the pork noodles was pretty much the same.  The potstickers?  Yep, the new waiter (who came in late) gave them to another party.  Since I was pretty much done, I figured I'd just back them off the bill and chalk it up to a suddenly popular place adjusting to getting slammed.  I didn't say anything to the wait staff, I figured they were already stressed enough...  As we were finishing up, the manager, Sam, came over and  apologized for the wait in getting our orders taken and admitted that our waiter had given my potstickers to another party.  He apologized and comp'd our meals.  He also brought out two orders (beef and pork) potstickers for us to take home with us (even though we both declined).  Lastly, he presented us with a pair of their custom spoons.  I'd admired the spoons as we were eating and had noticed that they had the restaurant's name engraved on them... Well, now I have one.    After the initial mis-step, the waiters pretty much recovered and the noodle dishes were excellent.  Sam did what a GOOD manager does and apologized and did ALL he could to recover from his staff's mistakes.  I was impressed and very surprised by this; it's no longer a common practice.  Oh, and the potstickers?  Delicious!  I'm enjoying the pork ones as I type.  So, 'Yes', I heartily recommend Shang's not just for the food but for a team that cares about the experience their customer has in their restaurant.",

There is very limited sitting and we had to wait for about 5 minutes for a table for 4 on a Sunday afternoon. There is counter seating and then you can sit and watch them wrap the beef pancakes and toss the handmade noodles.  We tried the spicy wontons, beef pancakes, pork and cabbage potstickers, Shang Beef with shaved noodles, Peking Zha Jiang Noodle and Beef Shank with handmade noodles.  The spicy wonton was pretty spicy. I know it's called spicy wontons but I can eat spicy.  We were almost done with the meal before the pork and cabbage potstickers came and that's because we had to ask about them. Everything was delicious and we plan on stopping by one more time before going back to Columbus Ohio.",

    "text": "Came here after reading all the good reviews. Had to say very disappointed. After the first sip of the pork rib noodle soup we knew this place is nothing close to authentic. It taste just like the soup base concentrate which you can find in a random Japanese supermarket. Overly sweet but no flavor of the ingredients. The hand-made noodles, which is supposed to be selling point of the restaurant, is overcooked and soft. Also ordered the beef noodle, spicy wonton and beef potsticker. Nothing special about the beef noddle soup. The wonton again is overly sweet but not spicy nor sour as it should be. Beef potstickers was the best out of the four items we tried, but nothing extraordinary about it. I'm not a water person but I have had two big glasses of water by the end of the meal. Not sure if it is the over sweetness or msg. Guess I had my hope too high up with all the great reviews. Didn't regret giving the place a try but don't think I am coming back.   The decor and service is good though.",

The noodles at this place are good handmade and tender and the sauces that they match with them are very favorful. Now, the potstickers at this joint are the bomb. I would come back all the way from CA to get those potstickers. Just be careful cause they are hot and very juicy. Now about the food I ordered pork rib noodles the broth was very good a Lil salty but was ok. The Peking zha Jiang noodles was very good too the DAN DAN noodles were way different from what I've had before but it was good.  Overall, it was very interesting and worth the prices which are very reasonable. Enjoy.",

    "text": "This place was good. The guys making the noodles are pretty awesome! To be honest, if I could give a 3 and a half star, I would, but I'm rounding up to a 4.  The food was pretty solid... we ordered the Pork and Cabbage Boiled Dumplings, Beef Pancake, Shang Beef Noodle Soup, and the Pork Belly Noodle Soup.  Everything seemed like it was made with great, fresh ingredients! They didn't do anything \"wrong\" per se.  Unfortunately for us, the taste was a little less flavorful for our liking. Even when dipping the dumplings in the sauce they provided, which was a nice sesame oil mixture with maybe shoyu or soy sauce.  Are we too used to super salty foods now???  I do tend to like more bland food, and my husband likes more salty food, but even for me, I thought the food was .... okay.  We liked the pork belly noodle soup better than the shang beef noodle soup, because the broth was a little more flavorful, and the fattiness of the pork belly really made the bites taste good. Also, the way the Bok Choy was cooked perfectly, they had a nice crisp to them.    I personally liked the chewiness of the hand pulled noodles, and my husband liked the size of the hand shaved noodles. The other reviewers were correct that you should be careful biting into the beef pancakes, my husband took a bite and the juice squirted across the table onto me! Good thing I was wearing black. I suggest taking a small bite out of the skin, and then when taking the next bite making sure to close your lips over the pancake so that if it does squirt, it'll hopefully squirt into your mouth and not across the table lol.  My husband ended up using a napkin to cover his pancake so that it would squirt onto the napkin and not across the table.",

    "text": "This was a 'Meh' for me.  We tried the Shang Beef Noodle Soup.  Soup was tasty but nothing above average and stingy on the veggies (there was literally only half a leaf of baby bok choy in it). We also tried the Black Bean noodles.   The problem with this dish is that the noodles are cold, the veggies are cold and the black bean sauce, though it may be hot, isn't hot enough to compete against the rest of the cold ingredients so you end up with a cool/room temperature bowl of noodles.  Also, the black bean sauce is pretty much straight up black bean sauce - no other flavor to balance out the sheer saltiness of it.  We tried the beef pancakes, too and they were ok.  About the size of a ding dong and I'd say 50% dough.  The hand pulled noodles had a nice texture but they smelled a little weird to me...just sayin",

I had spicy wonton and Shang's beef noodle with knife shaved noodle. Both items were amazing!! The beef was so tender and tasty but not salty at all. Knife shaved noodles were different and delicious.  If you sit at the counter, you can watch the men making hand pulled noodles. I enjoyed watching them make noodles!! Kids would LOVE watching this ;-) Their water of the day was lemon and cucumber infused water. So refreshing! The waitress was very nice and gave us super quick service but there was only one waitress working at the time. It was pretty busy so we felt bad asking her for more water or more napkins. Even though this place is small, I felt it was way too much for her to take care of all the tables at lunchtime on Sundays. The price is reasonable and the food is amazing. Very clean place. We'll be back!!",

    "text": "We were really excited to try this place. We love hand pulled noodles. I've eaten them in Beijing in several places. We're Korean, and Korea has many Chinese living there who brought hand pulled noodles to Korea, so Koreans love hand pulled noodles. So, that's my food background that will shed light on my review.  I think it's a hit or miss on the dishes. We tried the chicken and mushroom. The sauce was good. The noodles weren't as chewy as I'm used to. It didn't have that slick but chewy texture. I would say probably the flour is an issue.   The staple of hand pulled noodles in Korea is Jja-zhang or I think they called it Peking Jja-zhang (I actually don't know how to spell it in English)... in Taiwan, Dan Dan, and in Peking as well they have lots of jja-zhanng... but in Peking, all the places I had it served the black bean sauce in a bowl or a small dollop. The noodles were slick, not from oil, but the noodles had a sheen to them. The same is True in Korea. There is a toothiness to the noodle. At Shang, the sauce unfortunately is super salty, for my taste. I had to send it back and didn't request a replacement. I was told that the style at Shang was salty. If you've had black bean noodles elsewhere, it's really delicious and flavorful. A funky earthy taste with the soy black bean sauce. Anyway, I wouldn't order it if I went back. I think the sauce at China Ma Ma is actually better.  The pork and cabbage dumpling was very delicious. I'd definitely order that. The beef and onion pancake wasn't what I expected, It was more a dumpling than a pancake. I'm used to having pancakes where the dough is cooked as in layers and there's beef within it with onions. These were over a inch thick and about 2 inches round... definitely more like a fried bun. They were okay, but not as good as the pork and cabbage dumpling.  The Shang fried rice was good. Again a little salty for me. I think maybe the restaurant doesn't want to deal with folks asking for soy sauce... but having a lot of the salt really takes away from the flavor. It's Chinese food so there's a lot of oil, but to also have it really salty meant I probably won't go back.  I'm glad there are so many great reviews. Maybe I haven't tried enough dishes. I think it's inexpensive... Five dishes for about $40 so that's pretty cheap.   It would be great if they tweaked some of their menu items. But hey, it's great to see that we have Artisan Noodles in Las Vegas.  The service on the other hand was great. The two servers worked hard to keep the busy spot running.",
