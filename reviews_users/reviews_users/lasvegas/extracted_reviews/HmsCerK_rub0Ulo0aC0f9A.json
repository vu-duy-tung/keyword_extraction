Nice variety...salmon skin salad was amazing...salmon skin without rice. Sushi extremely nice, fresh. Super friendly service. Clean, nice atmosphere, music. AYCE is such an awesome deal. Come hungry!! Can't wait to return.",

Even with the Oct month being ayce for only $20 for dinner that the quality would be not as good as others, if you know what I mean, but no. It was awesome. And the additional items added on to the menu are so very delish.   Thank you Andy for putting your restaurant where you did so I don't have to drive too far to eat there. Lol.",

Biggest Mistake!!!   We checked it out before bringing my mom, and met with the chef and owner ( who claimed he worked at yellowtail in the Bellagio and Nobu at Ceasars we love Nobu so decided thus was the place for moms birthday dinner! Bonus the Chef seemed very nice!  When we arrived 5 adults & 2 toddlers we were hungry and excited, however we met with the two worst servers!!! They were extremely rude, unfriendly, and lacked knowledge they also never checked on us after our first order ?? We had to leave our table three times to request food, drinks, and get this our check!!! Don't worry they didn't forget to charge us a 20% gratuity charge!   After two hours of sitting we left hungry and spending just under $200.00 with no dessert for my mom or any of us!! Because although green tea cheesecake is on the menu the server said it was not available today they were sold out at 6pm and no business?! Okay make it up to us with some ice cream... 1/4 scoops with fingerprints actual finger prints!!!!  On our ice cream so disgusting!!!  Thankfully we went to cream at downtown summerlin after for taco Tuesday and as always they were great! And saved our day!",

    "text": "Before I begin I would like to add a disclaimer to my personal review of this restaurant. By no means am I trying to pick on any particular individual with this review. This review is based on my first time experience to eating at this restaurant.  Cleanliness 1 star  Ambiance/decor 1 star  Food quality 1 star  Customer service 1 of 2 stars  Over all this is a good place for those who love AYCE sushi. The modern look and family style seating are very welcoming when you first walk in. At a glance of the whole restaurant the level of cleanliness was more than acceptable. Quality of fish used for the sushi was hit and miss. I was served on a couple of occasions some sushi that didn't look fresh and didn't taste fresh either. Food quality for the rolls was good. Now for the customer service I experienced wasn't the best. To give some background I worked in the restaurant industry for 3 years. I know when the major rush of customers come in to restaurants. To avoid the rush and enjoy the experience of eating sushi I chose to come in on a Saturday mid afternoon. I was literally the ONLY person there at the restaurant. I was greeted by a waitress almost immediately which was great. I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar to interact with the sushi chefs as they are the experts. Unfortunately this is where my experience went south. The sushi chef catering to me was not as friendly and very short with the conversations I would try having with him. I felt rushed with ordering sushi when I just started eating a roll in front of me. I kept getting rushed and kept getting asked what else I wanted when I wasn't even finished with what was in front of me. It became somewhat uncomfortable. I heard someone say hello and it seemed to be the manager or owner as their communication/people skills were very good. Unfortunately due to the poor service I felt I was receiving from the sushi chef I was too poor in a mood to really interact with this gentleman. The waitress definitely was kind and made sure everything was ok with me. Aside from that, my personal opinion on the sushi chef attire was very poor. Using baseball caps and inconsistent attire reflected in the attitude. The worst part of this experience is that I was the ONLY person there. Never have I felt so rushed when eating sushi. To make matters worse I got tired of getting rushed so I told the sushi chef I was done ordering. Next thing I know the chef pulls out his phone takes off his cap and goes sits in a corner. I have to give a real review of the restaurant so it will stay at 4/5 star ratings. If I was rating on customer service alone. This review would have been a 2/5 star rating.",

Their foods however was very good but we had to wait for a very long time for the foods to arrive,  a little later that evening either the owner or the manager came over to us and showed his concerned to make sure we were okay,  I did tell him that it was unusual to wait so long for the foods.  My son did not get a straw with his drinks.  We were there on Tuesday evening around 7 pm so it was even crowded, and because it took a long time to get out foods,  we didn't get out of there close to 9 pm.  If had their services was great they would have gotten 5 stars.  We will unlikely be going back again.  Since it was my wife's birthday,  they didn't have any candles and yes we know it is not the restaurant's responsibility but it would have been nice if they had candles as well.",

Expect smaller portions for AYCE, but thats typical. Only complaint is the wait on many of our orders, with some being forgotten or duplicated. It got ridiculous at the end, could've been due to how busy it was...or they wanted us to stop eating. LOL",

Not only has the food's quality decreased, but while eating my meal I noticed that something was stuck in my throat. I got nauseous and couldn't figure out what it was. I was unable to finish the meal I had already paid for... and I come to find out there was a fish bone lodged in the back of my throat. Thanks to my friend who suspected it was a fish bone, my sister, after many minutes attempting to take it out, finally was able to pull it out of my throat. Due to this experience, I will never return to this sushi restaurant again. The attached picture is of the fish bone after having been removed.",

    "text": "I'm happy to say that there is new sushi bar in town which has a great all you can eat option. Luckily we were passing by on their first day of business so we decided to give it a try! I was originally just looking for some appetizers to snack on but the all you can eat dinner for 28.00 seemed pretty reasonable so I went with the all you can eat.   I started with the Kobe beef sushi roll. It had Kobe beef, avocado and a sweet type of sauce drizzled on the top. It was delicious!   The crispy buffalo shrimp was tangy . They were bite sized shrimp with buffalo flavoring.   The 007 was like a California roll but with big pieces of shrimp and avocado draped over the rolls. I enjoyed these as well!  Bacon and scallop skewers were mostly bacon with tiny pieces of scallops inside. They had different skewers available . I would like to try the bacon and mushroom skewers next time.   Chicken Katsu wraps were good especially for people like my husband who don't eat sushi. He was happy with the wrap and his cucumber salad .  We ended the meal with some honey toast. It reminded me of hawaiian rolls with ice cream and honey on the top. It  was my first time having this dessert be prepared for sweetness overload!  I liked the variety on the menu and that there wasn't a lot that was left out of the all you can eat. Except for the sashimi but it was okay with me because I don't eat sashimi. I thought the picnic type of chairs were cute and comfortable. The service was on point and I can't wait to go back. My husband even found something he would like to try on our next visit!",

Tried the : Shrimp popper, Salmon Special, The Hanabi special, my absolute favorite roll was the Crispy rainbow i love the combination and sauce.   I also tried the salmon poke and tuna poke i personally did not like the seaweed in the poke.   For dessert i tried the Honey Toast it was good, The bread was nice and chrispy but it's just hawaiian bread and vanilla ice cream with honey.   Just a reminder fellow yelpers the umm 8.01 discount for Ayce has expired. Idk if they just have not gotten around to taking that down or just smart business lol ;) Either way give Hanabi a shot!",

I love that they don't have a lot of rice on the nigiri. They have the standard rolls and some like Sunrise/Sunset, Hanabi Special, Blossom, and the sashimi specials - the seared salmon is my favorite. The uni has always been good, and I love getting the oysters. I usually ask for the udon soup without the noodles because I really like their broth. We've tried almost all of the appetizers, but be careful since the portions are large, you might get stuffed. It's the only place where Korean bulgogi is on the appetizer menu. All the items on the menu except for ramen is part of the all-you-can-eat. In our opinion, it's one of the best made-to-order all-you-can-eat places for us. I think we average 8 visits a month here.",

We had a-la cart:  -Coco Shrimp Roll: Yum! -King Crab Miso: Yum! -Tiger: Good -Korean BBQ: Good, but some pieces were just fat -Agedashi Tofu: Yum!  I can understand why the sushi runs a little small- for the AYCE customers. Great prices, we came when there was a 50% off roll special.

I tried a Japanese stout which I didn't even know existed until I came here. It was so nuts I had to try and was not disappointed.   The sushi was great. My favorite was the salmon roll which consisted of cooked salmon. I normally prefer the raw condition, but the sauce and tempura coating really pulled it all together.

It has a very modern, urban feel.   Now for the best part, the sushi.. OMG. So good! Our favorite roll was the Coco Salmon. The salmon literally melts in your mouth and the coconut flavor is just right, not too over powering. Definitely 5/5. Our next favorite was the Sunset roll. I could not get enough of the creamy sauce on that one, another 5/5. The final roll we got was the Mona Lisa. This one was still very tasty, but a little bit too much cream cheese for me. I'd have to say 4/5. The ginger salad was also tasty. It was pretty standard, but a large portion size.   I cannot wait to come back here again and try out some more rolls. Honestly the best, freshest fish around!",

First off, the staff was so friendly... everyone from the servers to the owner/chef Andy.  * Fish was super fresh * Great selection/variety of items on their AYCE menu (rolls, appetizers, sashimi, entrees ... and a whole lot more).  * Portions were perfect (they don't try to stuff you full of rice). * Rolls are unique and flavorful --- and their assortment is quite impressive.  I tend to like rolls that are not deep fried or filled with shrimp tempura on the inside (Most AYCE places only have a few rolls that are not fried) However.  at Hanabi I had more than enough to choose from and everything I tried was DELISH!  Amazing experience all around ~ and the best sushi bar in Las Vegas HANDS DOWN.",

I like the all I roll though and I like how the AYCE included cooked menu items like tonkatsu etc... but I just felt like the quality of the sushi was not that great. The poke smelled kinda fishy, and the soft shell crab tempura was too much breading, the green mussels were also just ok, a bit rubbery, although I have to say Shrimp tempura was good though. Also they had a lot of little add ons that you gmhad to pay extra for even if it was dinner so that was a bit of a turn off too. I would go back, but probably not my first choice.",

Don't get me wrong the nigiri we ordered was good despite the slight confusion we had looking and realising there were 2 slices of blue fin tuna on each piece on rice. No complaints though as the fish had a decent taste. Everything that followed was hard to choke down. Stay away from the spicy tuna nachos. I'm talking a spicy tuna glob in the middle of fried wonton \"chips\" smothered in a yuck yuck sauce. Thank goodness for the hot tea to wash down that hot mess. The rolls were bland and lacked any unique twist other places have. Total fail trying a new spot. Never coming back.",

    "text": "Checked it out for dinner with friends since it was the closest AYCE sushi spot. I'm on the fence about this place. For now, I will give this place a 3. It wasn't the best, nor was it the worst. Just meh.  We were acknowledged and greeted promptly as we walked through the door.  The restaurant was loud, lively,  and was about at 50% capacity for a dinner time. Not too bad. We informed the hostess there was three in our party and lead quickly to a 4-top. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and came back to my party with only place settings and menus for two..  I corrected it myself by grabbing from the table next to us. Aside from that little hiccup,  service was quick and they were attentive. I never had to ask for a refill on my beverages.   Pricing was good for an AYCE. $24.99. But very confusing. Why put on Yelp! that to check in the price is $24.99 when the price is already that to begin with? I thought the draw for businesses using Yelp! was to for an incentive for visiting their establishment?  My qualifications for an AYCE restaurant are very minimal:  - fresh ingredients, mainly their uni and amaebi - is their salmon skin hand roll actually crispy and mostly salmon skin? - do they have natto? - do they carry fresh wasabi?  Their uni was very fresh. Firm and no bad aftertaste. Same with amaebi. The downside to their amaebi is the puny size and no tempura heads to accompany the nigiri.   Their salmon skin hand roll should really be considered a salmon handroll as there was more salmon than fried skin. Taste was fine and as always I forget to ask no eel sauce. I'm very picky to menu items; don't list something if it's not what you are presenting the guest. While we are on this topic, please don't say that you have soft shell crab on the menu and only give half of the soft shell crab. I understand it is only 1 per guest on AYCE, but at least specify it's half of the soft shell. I'll gladly pay for a full crab.  Natto was not on the menu from what I saw, but they did carry it. Down side, they were out! I get that it is a Tuesday and they were closed Monday, but it's a Tuesday... deliveries should have been made to compensate for a busy weekend if they were running low, so that was a let down.  Seeing as they were not up to par with my necessities for sushi, I opted to not inquire about fresh wasabi.  Dessert menu offered the nornal sushi staple: tempura ice cream and mochi ice cream. Nothing made the desserts stand out or scream out.  But definitely willing to give them a chance again.",

I love their nigiri options, and their roles are also fantastic. They recently started offering tonkatsu ramen which I cannot wait to try. I love that they offer fresh oysters. The authors are huge and absolutely scrumptious and come served on ice with lemon. We love the simply shrimp, crazy caterpillar, loco mojo, and red rock rolls. Customizations are available upon request.  We here frequently with friends, probably once every two weeks. We love the consistency we always know what we're going to get when it comes to quality.

The waitresses were very kind.  But it was like a train wreck.  Through the entire experience, they forgot what we order, gave it to the wrong table, we had to re-order.  It was a hot mess.  My brother and I honestly gave up.  We did the AYCE special for $20.  We were there for about an hour and a half, literally an hour was us waiting for our food that never came.  Which honestly was REALLY annoying.  There were even times when the entire staff was arguing because a to-go order was misplaced.  Honestly, the entire experience was so bad, I would NEVER come again.  The reason why I gave it a two instead of a one is because the waitress were honestly nice people.  The entire overall experience was TERRIBLE.    I would comment on the food, but I can't even remember eating anything because they barely gave us anything.    Spent $50 on sushi, ended up getting a front-row seat to a live reality TV on Korean workers' drama at a sushi restaurant.  I usually go to Drama Fever for me Korean drama, but I guess not this time.",

Surpsingly they were attentive all the way to the end, unlike most sushi places who ignore you after your third order. The blue fin tuna and scallop nigiri were my favorites. I also like how they offer other dishes on the ayce menu such as curry. Kinda disappointed in their oysters though:/ they did not taste fresh and there wasn't any sauce with it. Sushi selection was very generic as well. Honey box toast and green tea cheesecake were good.",

The all you can eat option has far too many restrictions, just raise the price and limit the restrictions to a few things. Or put those on a separate page of the menu.  2. Stop threatening to charge for uneaten portions under the all you can eat. Portions are so small I doubt it's a cost issue.  3. Delivery of food items gets very slow after the initial order, if that's intentional then stop it. It's very noticeable.   4. Portion sizes of just about everything are the smallest I've seen in any sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.",

We were both ravenous, so AYCE sushi was the obvious answer. I checked Yelp and Hanabi had fabulous reviews. We are around 4:30 in the afternoon, and the place was empty. But that just lead to an amazing experience. We chose to sit at the bar and the ladies who manage the bar were prompt, polite, and gave great recommendations. When I went for myself second visit, we sat at a table, but our experience was just as good. Our waiter was so nice, gave great recommendations, and even let us get away with using our one per person to order two of the same thing for one person.   When it comes to food, everything was so fresh, creative, and the presentation was amazing. Their sashimi was the perfect portions and they have lots of non sushi items too, so this place is great if you want to check it out with a non raw fish eater. You have to try the Sushi Bomb roll, the Sunset roll, Animal Style roll, and the Mona Lisa Roll. The CocoSalmon roll was also very creative and good.  This place is a hidden gem in Village Square and if your a fan of delicious flavor, you should check them out!",

Service was attentive but wouldn't categorize it as warm and friendly.  We didn't get water refills until the end of the meal and when we finally asked.  Food came out quickly - hot foods hot.  Adults got the AYCE option. Kids opted for a chicken katsu kids meal and ala carte shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi. Sashimi was $11 and seemed spendy for the three pieces.   Most of the sushi here is pretty mediocre. Not bad, but it's not knock your socks off.  The \"creative\" rolls like The Sunset were unimaginative and just alright.  We got an order of spicy tuna nachos. Guess we should've known based on the menu (see picture), but it was literally a heaping mound of spicy tuna served with something like sriracha mayo and Tostitos Scoops (yes, straight from the bag of Scoops that you would eat with jarred salsa). The spicy in the tuna wasn't even mixed evenly as the bottom of the lump was spicier than the top.  The honey toast is a poor representation of this great Japanese dessert. It was not Japanese bakery bread but a piece of King's Hawaiian sweet roll. The ice cream wasn't vanilla like described. It was more like a yuzu sorbet, but I thought it was better than vanilla ice cream. The sorbet was the best thing we had that night.  One of the tips mentioned the bench seating for each table. Not ideal but it wasn't too bad.  Doubt we'll be back here despite the convenience. There are many other AYCE joints in town to choose from which you'll leave much more satisfied.",

The staff and chefs were happy to greet you at first glance and say goodbye once you were all ready to leave. Though they did have an all you can eat for a time limit deal, we opted in for single rolls as we werent as hungry to destroy as much after a movie and popcorn that hour prior. We started off with the 007 and loved it, fresh, creamy. Then did something a little more spicy with our favorite ingrediant; avocado and what seemed like a tobasco/hot wing sauce appropriately named the 911. I'm a spice guy myself so it was well received.  After that, we enjoyed the heated Snow White roll that melted in our mouth and was clearly our favorite. The service was top notch and they were quick on the drink refills without a single issue. We stayed talking for a bit and although most places seemed pushy after a meal, they were happy enough to keep asking to refill our drinks, which was refreshing. We give this grand opening a great review because it was great service, great food and not too bad on the price for great atmosphere and a clean establishment.   Thanks for the good stuff, highly recommended, though go hungry for the All-you-can-eat as you'll definitely want to try out most of their great combinations.",

    "text": "I am not a huge of fan of all-you-can-eat sushi menus, but it's very common in Vegas.  However, I really enjoyed it here and would actually come back and do it again.  A friend and I checked this place out for the grand opening, and we really enjoyed the experience. Thanks Hanabi!  The restaurant has a sushi bar and modern bench style seating.  While Hanabi is located in a shopping center, it reminded me of trendy hot spots you'd find in bigger cities, which is cool to have in this area.   The sushi was delicately and beautifully crafted (I know because we sat at the sushi bar and watched) into masterpieces that tasted as great as it looked. We were fortunate enough to see the owner, Andy, work his magic on most of our orders.  You can order nearly everything offered on the menu, including poke salad, soft shell crab, and oysters.  I was most impressed by how fresh the food was - like so fresh, you can nearly taste the ocean where it came from.  Because of the outstanding quality, I didn't feel like the rolls were heavy, but rather light and very satisfying.  My only disappointment is that we didn't make it to dessert. Honey toast, and all-you-can-eat... I shall be back!",

I usually don't care about the level of service I'm receiving as long as the food is good, but in all seriousness, the waiters and waitresses were extremely attentive on my visit, which I was really appreciative about. I especially appreciated how the owner was really friendly!  But on to the more important topic, food:  The appetizers here were sooooo good. I forgot the names of them, but one of them had like a spicy salmon that you mix with seaweed. You mix it up and then eat together. The flavor was so good! I believe it was called Salmon Poke. Who knew mixing the two would taste so good together?  I went with a group of sushi eaters, so I can't comment much about the rolls since our meal mostly consisted of sushi. I really enjoyed the tuna, which after having visited Japan, I get really weird about eating tuna here in the States because nothing tastes as the real deal. But the tuna here was surprisingly good! My favorite was the mackerel though I believe it was. It tasted extremely fresh and had the nice flavor you expect out of piece of sushi.  My group also ordered a yellowtail collar that was SO GOOD. The meat was soft. It had really good flavor, and I seriously wished I ordered more of it.  We also had kobe beef here, and it was sooo good. It shocked me to see that they had real kobe beef, but they even had an official certification for how legit the beef was.",

Noteable must-haves: Alaskan King Crab, Toro, Citrus Yellow Tail (all of the tuna is excellent), Oyster, Jumbo Scallop (Phenomenal!), Fried Garlic Chicken, A5 Kobe Beef (not an easy find in Vegas).  Great experience. This is my new go-to sushi spot.   **As an added bonus** the selection for your non-sushi eating friends was SUPERB.

Was my all day 4.5 star.. now? I'll need to give it one more shot? Sashimi is fresh, the rice is pretty good (I'm spoiled with rice), the menu is large.. the oysters were just right... At a $25-30 pp... there's a lot of competition",

The AYCE has great options and is so affordable.  It's also right in our neighborhood, which is cool.   Highly recommend this restaurant.   Don't wait any longer!  Go check it out.",

Given that there were only 4 other customers, our waiter was quick and our food was prepared fast.  The quality of the sushi were good. I liked that the  fish/rice ratio was excellent, not too much rice which is what other AYCE would do to make you full faster and eat less.  They also don't limit your selections in the menu which is a big plus.    Hubby and I will definitely be returning.  Their lunch AYCE was $20 & dinner $25.",

It's absolutely gorgeous and clean this sushi restaurant. I loved the way it was decorated and the seats were so comfy. I'm a culinary student so I pay great attention to cleanliness. When I was going to the restroom the kitchen looked organized and clean. They had an area for storage that was covered with a curtain but so organized. It looked like some of the sauces they used were stored in scholles, which great!!! Proper food safety handling. Nothing is ever contaminated by opening a bottle and closing bottles with bare hands.   The sushi was super fresh and arrived quickly. I loved the salmon poke. It was my favorite. The price is also great. For lunch AYCE is $19.99. My boyfriend and I would drive a little ways to go to a place that's called Naka Sushi that offers it at the same price but this place is way better. They offer more for appetizers and the restaurant is so clean. Not only that Ashley the waitress is extremely tentative. Such good customer service. My tea was never out. She always refilled it. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will love it.",

There was only one server going around checking up on all the customers, but she was very efficient and incredibly nice.   We ordered 7 rolls:  -Andy special -Hanabi special -Sunset -Caterpillar -Crab Mania -Sushi Bomb -Full Moon (Only deep fried roll)  The wait is longer here because if you order your rolls, they will make them all at once before serving it to you. Unfortunately, all the rolls were just mediocre :-( The rice was falling off some of the rolls and a bit difficult to pick up.  I had the green tea cheesecake for dessert, fairly good but pretty small. Unlike other places, you are only allowed to choose one type of dessert. For example, you cannot have ice cream and a mochi. You have to specifically pick one or the other.  Overall, it was disappointing.",

They're always happy to create you your own special roll based off of what you tell them you like and are so helpful when you're feeling indecisive. The price is a few bucks cheaper than most all you can eat spots. And they always have specials like blue fin, salmon belly and more! My favorite part is that there never a wait to be seated.

The sweet shrimp was probably old because it was cooked. Usually par cooking is a technique to somewhat hide the fishiness of seafood as it gets old. The sea urchin was horrible. It looked dark and tasted off. Usually it will taste creamy with a lil briney flavor but this was of bad quality. Appetizers were good. They were hot and crispy when expected. The place was empty at 9pm. Not sure if that's just the lack of traffic in the area but it seemed more like the public knew about the quality.",

The care placed into every dish is apparent both in flavor and presentation. I personally love sashimi and not every place gets sashimi right either because of their fish quality or because they over season the fish -Andy and his team let the fish speak for itself with clean and elegant flavors.  There is an extensive list of rolls, soups, salads, entrees and appetizers. Did I mention the miso soup? If you like miso get it here -you won't regret it.  They offer a dessert menu with mochi, ice cream, honey toast and green tea cheesecake....but the True star here is the fish flown in fresh from all over the world!

We started the meal off right with finding a nice steal on the drink menu (Nigori bottle for $15). I enjoy the unfiltered sakes over filtered as I find the sweetness compliments most of the roll ingredients (i.e. Yuzu, cilantro, jalepeno, ginger etc). We ordered four different specialty rolls of which I recall the Mad Caterpillar (eel/tuna) was the best one. The service was on point and the cherry on the top was that the bill was 50% off (assuming to bring in more traffic on Wednesdays).  Regardless of discount, we would come back.",

It was my favorite! 8pc tempura combo was huge and done w/a perfect golden crunch. We also had salmon skin salad, animal specialty roll, and 2 orders of the agedashi tofu. It was sooo good!

Now I became a regular for their superior selection of sushi and their grills are a good pair with all the creative rolls they have. I tried the grade 5 kobe beef and the marbling itself says it all. Every bite melted in your mouth.  Hanabi also offers great selection of premium cold sakes to premium japanese beers that not alot of other japanese restaurants have in stock of. One of my favorite sake :dassai which is more of a citrus and cleaner finish sake wine pairs well with chef's premium selection of sashimi!!  Get to know the sushi chefs! They'll definitely accommodate you from beginner sushi eaters to sophisticated eaters. Will be back again!",

There were even a few new rolls that I've never heard of like the Coco Shrimp Roll (I believe that's what it's called).   The Coco Shrimp Roll was super creative (in my opinion), and I would've never thought of having coconut shrimp in a sushi roll (it was a great combination by the way).  The waitress was really nice too. She was really helpful on informing my family and I about the menu.   Plus the honey toast and green tea ice cream mochi was really awesome.  The only reason this was a four instead of a five star was because a few dishes were just 'okay' in a sense. The sushi, sweets, and service was amazing. But just a FEW of the dishes (hot dishes) were 'okay' nothing too outstanding about them.  But either way 4/5 would go again.",

The layout and design is very clean, simple and yet elegant.   Now to the important stuff... The food! We were not disappointed and were extremely pleased with every item ordered. The quality was extremely fresh, the taste was great -better than expected for AYCE, the presentation was perfect.   We sampled more than 24 dishes from their menu and they were all exquisite. There were not any favorites on the table because they were all great. I would like to note that the eel, salmon, mackerel, and yellowtail were all noticeably high quality and fresh - compared to other AYCE restaurants - the value here at their prices is well worth the money spent!   As other reviewers stated - this place is phenomenal.   Thank you to Andy who took the time to ensure that we enjoyed each of our dishes.  We were also thanked upon exiting.",

I was very happy with the quality of the food and the presentation. They have a large selection of rolls to choose from on their menu. The service was a little slow, but I realized it was because they made everyone's rolls at the table at one time and put them on one large serving plate. I will ask them not to do that next time.  The only dish I did not care for was the honey toast. They served us a roll with ice cream and honey. If you want good honey toast, go to Ichiza in China Town.  I would definitely recommend eating here. It's a few dollars more per person than other AYCE places around town, but it was worth it.",

An added bonus is AYCE discounted price for October. A neighborhood favorite and will be a regular customer.   Updated Review:  I have been a regular visitor to Hanabi, and my thoughts about this hidden gem have not changed. The personable owner, Andy, always welcomes and greets the customers and makes sure everything is fine.  The quality and presentation of the food is top notch. The staff is very friendly and attentive. If you're in the neighborhood, stop in for a meal.  You'll be glad you did.  But P.S. Don't forget the green tea ice cream. It's the real deal!l  Update 07/27/17  Hey Summerlin Residents. I've been a regular customer at Hanabi for over a year and I have to say the sushi is still super fresh and of high quality.   The owner, Andy, still takes time to greet all of the customers and is a very friendly guy, as is his entire staff. The restaurant has been updated with the addition of chairs to the wooden benches, making for a comfortable and pleasant dining experience.   As an added bonus, Hanabi is celebrating its second anniversary with some drink promotions, including buy 1, get 1 House sake and buy 2 beers  and get one free.   This hidden gem in Summerlin is definitely worth the trip for anyone who likes sushi. There are also many cooked dishes for those not as adventurous.   Trust me, once you try the food, you will return. Enjoy!",

The space itself isn't bad with a clean decor and friendly service. The fail all comes with the quality of the sushi and the combinations in the rolls here. Typically when i do AYCE sushi i am 90% nigiri and 10% rolls. After placing my traditional 90/10 order for the first round, the quality made me want to order rolls to cover up the sub par quality of the fish. I found myself not even wanting to eat some of the nigiri but i felt as if i had to as to not get charged extra for it in the end. Second round was more rolls than anything was also a disappointment because there was just so much sauce, a mess of combinations, and flavor that didn't resemble anything delicious. After paying the bill i felt cheated to be honest, as i felt like i was fed something i didn't want and was forced to pay for it. A terrible feeling if you were hoping to go out for a nice dinner. I am trying to understand the positive reviews here as i didn't experience anything close to what others have said.",

They don't make spicy salmon rolls and their sushi was falling apart--the rice wouldn't stick so the sushi would fall apart. We are avid sushi eaters btw! The main issue we had was asking them for a box because we had a few pieces left from our AYCE. I get that most places don't allow this for AYCE, but I thought I'd ask anyway and I asked one of the servers, who brought us a box, but upon taking it from him, another server RAN over and snatched it out of his hands in front of us and said, \"No, no, no--no boxes for AYCE.\" I found this was not in good taste and the other server was clearly embarrassed and ultimately, it was horrible customer service on their part in that situation. They bargained an extra $5 from us to take a few pieces of sushi home, but they have forfeited potentially hundreds of dollars from us. from AYCE, because we are not coming back.   P.S. I also ordered a green tea cheesecake and they got the order wrong and tried to make me reconsider my order so I can eat what they brought, which was a green tea mochi. But their green tea cheesecake was hard and I do not recommend anyway.",

It's such a great deal and price for AYCE. We will definitely be coming back here when we are in the area!",

My previous review from nearly a year ago gave this place 5 stars and in my opinion it was well deserved over several visits.   I noticed that since last month (October 2016) they began an all day promo for only $19.99 for ayce which is good for lunch and dinner. This promo was extended until Nov so I took a friend here and was hoping it was just as great as it used to be. Unfortunately it wasn't.   The rice was hard & undercooked. The fish slices were all significantly thinner. The fun Japanese music no longer played and service wasn't as good as it had been before. My favorite item of all is no longer included for ayce (uni) there's now an extra fee of $1 per piece.   It just isn't the place I remember. Maybe business isn't as good as they expected but with the changes implemented it can't get better for them. I hope they make some changes soon so more people aren't disappointed.",

Also, one waitress (middle age) was kind and attentive and always took my order fast (she deserves five stars) then a younger guy comes and takes my order and I said \"2 orders of salmon and 2 orders of salmon roe\" while pointing to the order. I saw him write down salmon roll but thought it's just how he remembers it..the waitress brought out the order and immediately asked if I ordered the salmon roe (I had done the same order like 4x with her before this) and she immediately took it back and came back with the right order. The dude who made the mistake kept saying in his language which I interpret it to mean \"oh salmon roe not salmon roll, ikura not salmon roll). Wasn't even the least bit apologetic and when he came back with the order he low key snidely said \"salmon and IKURA\". Like bro 1. it says on your own menu salmon roe. 2. Don't ever think that the customer is wrong 3. Really pissed me off with his attitude. So in conclusion, nice joint with good waitresses but Small sushis( they do have a pretty extensive ayce menu though).",

    "text": "Great sushi. And really open, fresh atmosphere. However, I won't be returning. The owner/chef came to our table about four times, interrupting our conversations. It was fine the first time but after that, it was distracting. Also, I've eaten at SEVERAL All You Can Eat sushi places and they've all been really chill if you have a few pieces of a roll left over. Not this place. We were told we'd have to pay if we didn't finish. Mind you, we only had about 6 pieces left. So my friends had to help me finish to avoid paying. Another thing: my friend and I ordered the same appetizer and the waitress asked me if I wanted to share with my friend and I told her no, I wanted my own. Maybe I'm sensitive but that bothered me. And she also kept forgetting to bring out some items we ordered, so we had to ask for them again. Overall it's a good place but I've been to other sushi restaurants and had a better experience.",

There is an all you can eat option and a la carte. They have very high end fish and Kobe beef as well as more entry level priced options. If you are craving some exotic fish he will order it in for you. We have been here 5 times now and it never disappoints.",

You can eat all you can eat and not only eat sushi but eat entrees like fried rice and soups. All the food is made fresh to order. The service is great! I love yama sushi but this place beats it cause again the food is fresh and service is great. I was very impressed with meeting the owner as he was walking around meeting his customers and getting feed back. Now that's great to see as he takes interest with what the customers has to say. You don't see that in alot of place. Andy's pretty cool to talk to, his humble, and very down to earth. Their quality of sushi is very different, you can taste the difference. And that difference is that there quality is fresh. Trust and believe me when I say Andy is a proud chef and did explain he like everything fresh and clean. Here at Hanabi you can taste the freshness and how exotic there sushi is. It will leave a taste on your taste buds wanting more. I highly recommend this place to all the sushi lovers!!!!",

We opted for the AYCE option which was more than worth it. They have a couple of interesting appetizers that we tried. One of the was the monkey brain or something to that effect. It was like tempura fried avocado but it was tasty. Sushi was unique and fresh. I had the red tiger roll and the baja roll. Red tiger was a spicier version of a typical tiger roll. The baja was a play on a special roll with addition of cilantro. Also tried the coco salmon roll which was interesting and almost sweet. Ended with a dish they called honey toast. It was tasty but only if it was warm because that's what I expected. Service was good granted we were the only ones in the place at a point. I would go back because I felt the AYCE was a good value for what they offered.",

I'm not much for AYCE since I'm not a big eater, but I have tried the a la carte menu several times and have been impressed every single time. The fish is fresh with a reasonable portion and the amount of rice is perfect. The menu is extensive and the only struggle is trying to narrow down what I want. The pricing for a la carte is in line with Summerlin, and I realize I *could* drive a few blocks and find something cheaper, but the food is good enough that I don't feel the need to. They also have a variety of specials if you're on a budget. But the thing I like most about this place and what keeps me coming back is the service. The staff are friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel valued. Vegas is saturated with sushi places, and many are just as good as each other. What sets a place apart is the service, and Hanabi gets 6 stars for that. It's the kind of business I want support even if it costs an extra dollar or two.",

When she arrived in the U.S., she wanted to try some sushi here. We had found a couple of good but just above average Japanese food since coming here. We decided to try out Hanabi since it was close to the movie theater and we were in a hurry to catch a movie. We tried a couple of rolls and got out since the movie was about to start. Needless to say, we went back to Hanabi and tried the all you can eat. We brought my brother and sister-in-law along with us from L.A. My wife was so delightfully amazed by their sushi. I myself was shock on how high the quality of fish they use. They are so fresh!!!  All we can say is amazing and delicious at the same time. I really can't recommend anything since all of the sushis and rolls were great. But if I have to choose a couple of items, I would go for the giant scallops and bluefin tuna. They are that good!  Andy, who is the owner, is so friendly and attentive. I can't say anything negative about his restaurant nor his staff. Jay, Jun, Jason and all the others were awesome. Thank you guys for having us. It was a wonderful experience to eat at your restaurant. This will be our only Japanese restaurant to go to. If they are close, we dare not to go elsewhere.  Lastly, this restaurant is simply just short of being in Japan. IT'S THAT GOOD!!!!",

She was great and explained the menu to me.  I ordered a $13 bento box that had miso soup, a salad, sashimi, sushi and tempura shrimp.  It had a little bit of everything in it and hit the spot.

    "text": "Idk where to start the staff was so weird and pushy and wouldn't let me or my mother look up without rushing over and asking us if we were ready to order. Even when we first sat down this girl stood behind me while I was first looking at the menu making me very uncomfortable, they didn't give us any time to decide anything to drink so we got water thinking they'd leave us alone but they just stayed circling our table. When we got our food the sushi was mediocre nothing amazing, too much eel sauce on top. But I ordered their beef ramen and it was pretty tasty but I got it to go and when I got home the broth had separated and the egg that was in it dyed blue! There was some sort of blue coloring in my broth. I don't know what was in it but it made me feel kind of sick afterwards. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I'm definitely not coming back",

The tables consist of 70% picnic table (yes, hard, uncomfortable picnic table seats) and 30% comfortable chair seating.   Tonight we came to find all the comfortable tables taken! I was adamant that we make a statement and find another restaurant; however, my companion had his heart set on all u can eat sushi!  My main complaint is this: they MUST change the seating arrangement!!!  WHO wants to go out to a dinner and sit on a picnic bench?",

    "text": "This little sushi spot located in Village Square used to be 808 Tapas...from the get go, the place is small but familiarly cozy. Nothing too special or out of the ordinary in decor, but a little on the modern side without getting too contemporary. Upon entering...greetings by staff welcome you like most Japanese places. All seem to be nice and helpful. Food wise, the sushi portion to rice ratio is a little off, sometimes more rice than other sushi restaurants. Food taste is pretty good to mediyoker depending on what you order.  This place doesn't seem to get overly packed, but it's a decent enough place to go to if you are craving sushi and in the area. Look for Yelp check in to unlock offers like sake. They also have specials going on on social media so be sure to check it out or ask to save on price.  Would I come back? Probably, but as a back up. Nice place to try though...you may have a different experience.",

Her actions made it possible to have an excellent dinner at Bachi Burger.   We have been there three previous times with the worst sounds made being the little soy sauce dishes being tossed on the floor.  We were seated at the last table in the restaurant closest to the restrooms at the time. The same person sat us that time as well. She is a shorter Asian woman with glasses.  Our boys are not children who cry throughout dinner, in fact they do not cry at all when they are out eating. Because they love food! They are the type who flirt with the other very friendly tall server and wave at the man who brought our iced teas.  You lost repeat customers who will take every chance that we get to make sure everyone knows what kind of a person you choose to employ.  Very rude and poor customer service! I have never had heard anyone works in service industry would talk to customer like that.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, everyone in this town is a sushi expert.  There are just a couple of rules you are going to have to follow if you want to roll out a new AYCE sushi bar in Las Vegas:  1 - Keep your prices competitive ($3+ more than everywhere else? Why?) 2 - Keep your fish fresh (if you cant sell it before it starts to turn, don't try to pass it on to unsuspecting customers) 3 - Don;t be cheap (buy sushi quality fish - believe me, we can tell the difference) 3 - Offer what everyone else does (if you wont serve me sashimi with AYCE, why should I come here?) 4 - Don't skimp on portions (look, stop being cheap, your fish is going rank, use it before it goes)  I will say it not the worst place I have tried in Vegas, but if I am paying piece meal instead of going AYCE, I expect you not to give my tiny little sliver of fish.  I'll be honest, the salmon tasted like crap. Sushi grade salmon doesn't taste like the cheap, color added, farmed raised crap you buy at Vons.  We are all sushi experts in this town - if you want to succeed, respect that.",

I really like the benches they have as tables, like an old camping table on a hiking trail. It's funny!. The food itself is pretty fresh, and the wait isn't too long from ordering to receiving. They are also pretty hidden, I literally stumbled across them by sheer coincidence a couple weeks ago and had to search yelp for over an hour to find the restaurant. Hidden gem? Definitely! The 1 bad mark I have is that this last time I came in, they were actually very slow, so we had multiple waiters dealing with us, so we would order from 1 person, he would leave, and 30 seconds later another guy came up asking if we needed anything else. But they didn't talk to each other. We put in 1 order, and both waiters brought us that roll. It was funny, but was also mildly annoying. I won't let it stand in the way of coming back though. I will definitely return, they are just too good!",

Personally, all you can eat/drink is a bad combination but whatever floats your boat!  The one thing I have to say about this place is that my brother and I both ordered the baked salmon roll and his came, but mine did not. I asked if mine was coming and the server said it was. 15 minutes later, the rest of our orders came and my baked salmon roll was still missing. So another server came and asked if we would like to order anything else, I then asked about my missing baked salmon roll, she said she would check on it & never returned for the rest of our dining. THEN, my friend ordered 4 rolls and only 2 returned.   Once we all decided we were finished eating, we STILL had not received our orders. My baked salmon roll never came and neither did her 2 other orders.   All in all, I enjoyed my dining experience here, but I wish that they servers here put in effort to correctly bring out food out.",

Really good pointer is that they actually have a salmon or tuna poke or octopus for AYCE even during lunch, which is a plus because not all AYCE places serves that.   Their shrimp tempura to die for. Hot and crunchy. Lunch is only 19.99!! They even have skewers which are my fave. I got the scallop and bacon which was SO scrumptious. Also ordered the salmon and white tuna nigiri. The salmon was okay. But the white tuna was super good and melts in your mouth. Decent sushi to rice ratio. Also ordered miso soup which was yummy and flavorful. And a spicy tuna hand roll which was also good. But if u want like avo or cucumber with it, u gotta ask for it.  Then for dessert, I ordered of course the green tea ice cream which wasn't too frozen. It was good and tasted authentic.   Service was nice. They never rushed us or bothered us while me and my girl were chatting away. They always came at the right time to ask if we wanted anything else to order. Also I think the manager would ask us randomly if we were doing okay during our time there which was nice.   The environment is simple with tables and a sushi bar. But I do like the type of tables they had. It was wooden benches and wooden tables which felt kind of Japanese traditional.   If you're in the area, I would def recommend this place. Food is great. Service is great. Price is even better!",

I didn't do ayce because I wasn't planning on getting a lot of raw fish and I feel like it's worth it when you order sushi/sashimi.   Clam miso soup: 5/5 great flavor. Didn't taste like it was made out of instant powder. Came with enoki mushrooms, yumm. And the bowl had about 5 Manila clams. $3.50  Sunset roll: 3.5/5 spicy tuna roll with salmon on top drizzled with a sauce that tasted like spicy mayo. They used too much sauce in my opinion and the salmon on top was skimpy. But each piece was a perfect bite size which I liked. $12  Hamachi Kama: 4.5/5 smelled a little fishy but it was soft and tender! $9  Gyoza: 4.5/5   Habachi steak: 3.5/5 had an interesting sauce that I cannot describe. But I smelled butter and I'm not a fan of that. The steak itself was ok, not that tender. It was a good portion though.",

Although The food came out VERY quickly, it was your average run of the mill sushi.  Very plain and bland tasting fish. We found ourselves using lots of soy sauce and wasabi in efforts to add flavor to the fish. Be warned, if you prefer soy paper to seaweed, be prepared to pay an extra $1.00 per roll.

Was not a fan of the beef teriyaki or the bacon mushroom that someone ordered but cannot mark them down since generally I do not order those dishes when I go to sushi.",

I liked the oysters, they were decently fresh. The spicy garlic edamame is good. The agedashi tofu was good.  The rolls were nothing special. The soup was overly salty.

Can take and give a joke, would definitely recommend to everyone and anyone whether or not you've had sushi before.",

Quality wise, hanabi can be comparable to a place like oishi sushi also on sahara or even naka sushi, on lake mead and rampart. Nothing spectacular, but a solid neighborhood sushi spot that has tasty good quality fish and friendly warm service. It is, when in proximity, the go-to place to raise your blood sugar to the gods, especially when stranded in a crazy random and ridiculous flash flood.",

I expect a lot more from a restaurant -- especially a new one listed as \"hot and new\" (at the time).   Yep, I will go on about this, anyone who reads my reviews will hopefully get it.  1. MUSIC.  Im not just saying I didn't like the music.  there was something  REALLY wrong with the sound system like someone disconnected a wire and only half of the frequencies were coming out of some fried wire behind the furnace(??).  I swear it wasn't just me.  My friend who was with me works in music and even offered to go fix the system for them.  It was SO bad i felt kind of queasy or bad trip or something. Completely distracting, especially combined with........ 2) YELLING! Every time anyone would walk in the door there was some sort of yelling they did. I understand if it was one of those places that had games or an mc or whatever (they have this crap in north hollywood but this is like the outskirts of las vegas)  and also florescent lighting,  Totally please NO.    3) the \"all you can eat\" rules and regulations.  Im not an \"all you can eat\" person.  First of all, i can't eat very much and second because i don't like rules!   These rules were so confusing and restrictive.  They could not totally explain them (maybe because its a new place?) yet, anything we asked for seemed to be impossible. Also, there were all these stipulations written in chalk on some blackboards near the ceiling.  I just wanted a tuna roll with avocado, but that turned into a humongous discussion i finally gave up and got shrimp hibachi.  Then I spent a long time looking for a shrimp within a sea of diced zucchini.   On the more positive side, its 2 for 1 saki and  there was some sort of shrimp ROLL that everyone in the entire place was going crazy for.  I just don't order shrimp rolls.  So maybe IM the problem!!!?  I feel a little bad saying all this, hence the 3 stars rather than 2, mainly because the staff was super nice and obviously trying very hard to please everyone.  I hope they can work out the sound system thing.  Also, its right next to a big movie theater so its technically a good dinner and a movie place!     follow chalk instructions, wear earplugs, the theater is 2nd run movies so tix are cheap.   I would go again, but not on purpose...... or get take out.  truth be told, we were aiming to go to the thai place next door which is for some reason closed on tuesdays.  wow.",

Everything was very fresh, delicious and nicely presented. I loved the atmosphere - very clean, modern and welcoming. I really liked the contemporary decor with the bench seatings, nice and fun huge blackboard on the wall they can utilize for house specials and all-you-can-eat rules (which btw the rules are the same as any other all-you-can-eat sushi places. I didn't find it unwelcoming). The staff, especially the owner Andy, was all so enthusiastic and pleasant. Andy went above and beyond to make sure our dinner experience was to our satisfaction. Another nice thing about Hanabi was that they have cartoon channel up on 2 of their 4 TVs which my 7 year old son enjoyed watching while we took time enjoying the all-you-can-eat to the fullest! Normally he gets bored and ask to go home. He didn't this time and even said, food is good here let's come back! This will definitely be my family's designated AYCE sushi restaurant whenever we crave sushi. So glad we found this place!!",

Owner was extremely attentive and helpful in recommending rolls based on your likes/dislikes in regards to fish, spice tolerance, etc., even asking if we had any allergies to be aware of.  He used to work at Nobu and is now branching out in his own!! They were very accommodating as some of the rolls we were interested in were spicy and switched it out with something simply delicious that worked for us. Absolutely loved everything we ordered and wouldn't be surprised if there was something you could order that would actually be bad or even mediocre. Would recommend for sure. The owner obviously is passionate in putting his heart and soul into this business and he surely deserves success in all his hard work.",

Nigiri is the way to go here. The quality is pretty good for an AYCE place. Rolls on the other hand weren't my favorite. Some, like the yellowtail special with cooked shrimp, jalapeno, cilantro, cucumber topped with yellowtail, ponzu, habanero, were too hot for my tastes. The Tiger roll (shrimp tempura, crab topped with spicy tuna with eel sauce) was the best of the bunch, the Mad Caterpillar (fresh water eel and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, spicy eel sauce) was decent, and the Crispy tuna scallion was not good with tuna that looked and tasted liked canned tuna. As a whole, the rolls seemed hastily crafted and lacked the precision of superior rolls found elsewhere.  2.5 Stars",

However, quality here is among the best AYCE I've had and the majority of lower-priced businesses in town have significantly lower quality to match.  APPETIZERS: This was our favorite section of the menu. The Jalapeno Popper dish that is commonly found around town was nicely presented here and actually had a good kick of spice for once! Salmon poke had a great spicy chili sauce, both were offset by the seaweed salad. We really enjoyed the grilled mackerel and the soft shell crab, but I did not care for the oysters. The real standout was the Rock N Roll appetizer, which is a riceless roll!  NIGIRI: Nigiri selection was ample, and fish was typically pretty fresh. The super white tuna, scallop, golden eel, and squid were good options, but I felt the salmon and yellowtail weren't that great and lacked flavor. Rice was an average portion, fish was cut on the thin side. ROLLS: We tried the Twilight roll and the White Dragon roll, both had several sauces and fishes, both were tempura-shrimp based. I generally try to be more adventurous with my roll picks but by this point I was too full to care. Rolls were solid and they had a lot of new specialty options, but I wish they had more riceless options.  The space was another sushi spot before Hanabi took over, but the modern, clean decor and chalkboard specials menu are a bit different. Service at the bar was attentive and we were frequently checked on by both chefs and management, though our empty dishes stacked up- this didn't really bother me, as they were pretty busy.  For those who are outraged by the higher AYCE price here- if $3 is really a deal breaker for you to drop your rating over, you have no business coming here. Stick to the Dollar Menu. The quality of dishes, freshness of fishes, and variety on the menu are more than enough to warrant the difference in cost.

The dessert selection was more on the small side, but the dinner selection compensated for it. We were celebrating a birthday and the chef came out with a special custom birthday plate of fresh cut oranges. He definitely went above and beyond. I will definitely be back!",

If I had paid their \"standard\" $28 a person, I might have been pretty upset. The food just was not good; it wasn't well made, and the quality was subpar.  The service was fine and our drinks were refilled in standard time intervals. The atmosphere is slightly hipster with wood benches and thin cushions. Honestly, I liked everything but the food here. If I had to describe the flavors, it would be as if you handed me a recipe for sushi and I went to the local Food4Less to get my fish and tried to make the dish I home. Please keep in account that my cooking skills are almost non-existent.   It may as well have been sushi you buy at Smith's. Not even in my top 20 sushi spots in Vegas.",

We've been spoiled by going to Oyshi ( we don't have any personal relationship with the owners) a few miles down on Sahara, where the fish has always been high quality and fresh    Hanabi doesn't offer a wide variety of non sushi choices ( like sashimi or other Japan dishes). There AYCE prices are less than Oyshi, but you get what you pay for.  Their seasonings are very mild.   Hanabi is a nice, clean restaurant. My personal tastes however prefer paying a little more elsewhere.   Just our personal preference. Try and compare.",

The host was super accommodating and kept updating us on when our table would be ready (we waited for about 15 minutes or so). We sat at one of the tables with benches...which tbh, I'm not a huge fan of benches. I prefer regular chairs because then I can at least lean back. However, the food made up for it. We ordered mostly appetizers and nigiri. I also ordered a half roll (bonus for offering half rolls!) called Golden Knight which came with spicy crab, shrimp tempura, and fried onions. It was pretty tasty!   Another big thing for me is the rice to fish ratio. It was perfect. The fish were cut with the right amount of thickness and wasn't overly packed with rice. Out of all the dishes that we ordered, my favorite was the soy braised pork belly. It was seriously melt-in-your-mouth! I also recommend getting the soft shell crab (downside is that 1 order = half a crab). You can't go wrong with any of the nigiri so I say get them all!   Dessert was pretty standard. I decided to try the green tea cheesecake. It was alright. It was a tiny slice. I ate it in 2 bites. That's how small it was. It was just eh for me. Didn't taste much of the green tea so it tasted like a regular cheesecake.   Overall, I recommend this place. With so many other dishes to try, I will for sure be back!",

My little boy didn't get their ayce because it's just not worth it and enjoyed their French fries! Their French fries was great too.   Their were only 2 main female servers that took our order and they are very friendly and always smiling.   I have been to another AYCE sushi place (by flamingo) But got turned off because that other place's tempura was really soggy. So with that being said, everything I ordered was perfect! From the nigiri sushi, to their special rolls, to their cooked food like tempura, calamari, garlic fried chicken and combination fried rice. Everything was A+. Oh sorry except for one boo boo. I ordered one order of green mussels which came out over cooked because it was rubbery. On the other hand, my husband ordered 5 orders of their green mussels without the sauce and all his mussels were perfectly cooked. So I still give this place 5 stars.   I was so full I wanted to order more food but couldn't anymore. So Hanabi, keep up the good work. Be consistent in handling seafood and u will keep me and my family as loyal customers.",

In reality the portions they sent over are TINY. You are not getting the alacarte size.  2)You get one hour to order, although they aren't super strict about it.  3) Service was good, no problem there. Friendly servers all around.  4) when you order the roll, they PACK that thing with rice and you get full quickly. 5) rolls on the menu are very similar to each other, adding 1 or 2 ingredients and calling it some other roll. I think the taste gets old quick .  6) Finally, was the food good? It was OKAY. For an Asian, we are accustomed to know what's good Asian food or not. This place is definitely not mind blowing or to be too excited about. It was Okay , most dishes I've tasted was about a 4/10 . A 6/10 in an AYCE place is pretty good in my book.",

Unlike other sushi spots that always seem annoyed when you order \"All You Can Eat\" , Hanabi always gives you a great big smile and always asks if you would like more.

Our food took a while to come out, we also ordered a King Crab Miso from our waiter which was a la carte, we later had to request it again because it never came, we were both really excited about the King Crab Miso and both woefully disappointed by it, it had so many mushrooms in it that initially we thought that was the crab, the crab we did find in the soup was grainy and just had an unpleasant texture.  The sushi overall was good, we both enjoyed our food, my boyfriend wished the rolls had been bigger but I didn't mind the size of them, more room for more food in my opinion.  Overall we would come back, probably during lunch time though, it was a little expensive during dinner pricing.",

The restaurant looks a lot different than its previous incarnation (808 tapas), it looks a lot more modern and feels more spacious and open.   The food itself is great. I am no sushi connoisseur, but have enjoyed everything that I have eaten from here. I mostly eat rolls (being pretty new to the sushi game) and the waitstaff has recommended some great options for me to order based on things I liked previously. My husband loves sushi, knows a lot more about it, and maintains that the quality of the food is great. He has taken advantage of the 28$ all you can eat offer, and it was a great deal for him. If you're hungry, it's the way to go! The staff brought the food out very quickly, I don't think they put any limit on how many items he could order at one time, and he ended up really pleased with the all you can eat deal.   On two separate occasions the kitchen comped us appetizers, the spicy garlic edamame and a seaweed salad. Both were very good - I would expect a sushi place to slack a little on appetizer quality, but they did not. The cook also came out personally to talk to us once about our food, and he generally seems to care a great deal about the restaurant and quality of his food.  We've brought friends here a few times and have been really pleased with the atmosphere, price, service and food.",

    "text": "Going to leave the most accurate review I can.   Price: This place is pretty pricey which is expected with sushi, but I paid 16.50 for 6 pieces of sushi it that gives you an example. They do have an all you can eat for 25$  Quality of food: I've been to 16 countries and eaten sushi in about all of them, ifs there's something I know and love its sushi. The sushi here was really sub-par it the rice did not stick at all causing the sushi to fall apart as it's picked up, not allowing you to eat it all together and enjoy it. Both of my orders had this issue. The flavor was as usual but nothing I'd expect with the price.   Service: The service here is actually really good, its not a big place but still the servers are very attentive and always check in. I believe one of the chefs made a round as well.   Atmosphere: The atmosphere is is nice, not crowded and has nice design a few TVs up playing sports channels, and seems like a nice friendly place to take the family.  Overall: The place isn't bad it's in a good location and has good service. The price vs the quality is what brings me to 2 stars overall when you go somewhere to eat those are my biggest factors. I'd recommend trying some other sushi place, you're in Vegas and can find amazing sushi anywhere so keep looking and save a few bucks for some good quality sushi!",

Anyway, great flavors, very hospitable service and a great array of choices. You really should give it a go. It's now my sushi spot.",

    "text": "We have been here 3 times.  The 1st experience was great!  We sat at a table instead of the sushi bar and had AYCE.  The waitresses weren't as attentive as I would typically like, but we did get all the dishes we asked for and the variety of side dishes available with the AYCE is great!  We even recommended this restaurant to some friends that love it.    The 2nd time we brought the kids along and they enjoyed it.  The 3rd time was date night and it didn't start off great.  We sat down and they brought us plates, 1 of which was really dirty.  We sent it back and a couple minutes later she returned with the dish.  Again, it was like pulling teeth to get them to come to the table to order more food.  It took about 20 minutes before she came back to get our 1st order and there were only 2 other tables there at the time.  I ordered a side dish of the vegetable udon and have had it before there, but this time there was something in it that was severely irritating my mouth.  Needless to say, with the poor service and inconsistency in the food, we won't be back.",

    "text": "OK so I love this place. The staff are talented, kind and humble... That's a great combination in my book. I have been twice since they opened. On both occasions the quality of the fish was excellent, extremely fresh. I know in Japan it's customary to judge a sushi restaurant on the Tomago, my litmus test is typically the yellow tail and it was as good as I have eaten anywhere.   It's not just the fish though, they have a great menu which brings together many different styles of cuisine from Japan.  I have been to quite a few all you can eat sushi places in Las Vegas, they usually bloat you up with a bunch of rice and overdone rolls. Not here, the all you can eat option includes regular sushi as well as rolls (including almost all of the special rolls) and other options like Japanese curry and Korean BBQ beef (which we didn't get to eat because our 1 year old devoured it, the guys were cool about that which was another plus in my book).  I go by my gut when it comes to most decisions in life. My gut told me these are guys who have integrity and they care about what they do. We will be back here at least once each week.  Thanks guys for an awesome experience!",

No real complaints about this place, the bench style seating was good and so was the Honey Toast dessert! The sushi was just average, nothing super special about it. Probably won't go back again though because Sushi Koma tastes better and is the same price if not cheaper.",

Also, the waitress was super sweet and I liked that the owner was there walking around asking how everything was. My two favorite rolls were the white dragon and coco salmon! Amazing!",

My husband, 7yo, 3yo a friend & myself had experience the worst service in our lives no joke. order a kids meal for my son the chicken was so spicy it made him throw up we asked if we could exchange it out for something different Bcuz my son didn't like the chicken it was way to spicy & I swear to you the 2 ladies who work there went off at us, saying \"why you returning the food huh you already ordered it I not taking that back nothing wrong with my food it's good your son is the problem k not my food\" we explained that it was spicy & it made him throw up & again she went off \"spicy? kids love spicy food something must be wrong with you son if he can't handle spicy food\". so after the argument she ignored us for the rest of our stay we tried to order more sushi and she kept saying I'm busy SMFH so my husband just walked up to the sushi chefs and put in all our orders then she comes over after and says we can only order one more round then we gotta leave , we was only there for 40mins ok and she's kicking us out already, I explained to her the time we got there and she said \"oh well you can order only 1 more round sushi cuz I got people waiting for this table\". Ugh I will n never ever eat there every again in my life I don't understand how people can be so rude to others expecially behaving like that in front of my kids is we're they crossed the line with me..",

Garlic yellowtail - garlic tuna - yellowtail special - tuna poke - just name some items - Also , to sweeten up the deal, they have a \"daily sashimi special\" so everyday it's different sashimi special- only two pieces but it's very premium - They have honey toast for dessert which is always a joy no matter where it's being served - This place is truly something great - CHECK IT OUT!",

There are a few restrictions, but, still have a wide variety of sushi and other items you can enjoy. It also includes dessert too lol. Service was amazing and food wait was quick!!! We managed to order quite a bit and the sushi chefs did an amazing job with taste, and food presentation.  They do have a yelp offer when you check in on Yelp which is great.  Now I definitely know why they are named Hanabi which means Fireworks! :) Overall experience excellent!!! I highly recommend dining here for great food and awesome service!!!",

We loved the variety....especially if you want to venture outside of sushi. Try the grilled skewers or the soy braised pork belly which were to die for. The sushi highlights were the seared spicy salmon and salmon avocado handroll. We came on a Friday night and it was very busy but we didn't have to wait. We did the all you can eat dinner for $25 which is a pretty standard pricing for Vegas...for lunch it's only $20 which is a steal. The fish quality is very good here, the slices are a little thinner than we would like and a little too much rice but were nit picking at this point. We just moved here and this is going to a regular spot for us.  Seriously a fun and great meal and they couldn't be happier to be having us for dinner.",

They also have a bunch of TV's so you can watch sporting events. Our favorite time to come us during the Golden Knights games. They show it and have $2.99 draft Sapporo. AYCE dinner is $25.99 and the menu is huge. They also have weekly and nightly specials.   My pictures are horrible because we started eating immediately. The sushi is so fresh and good. One thing I love about this place is the sushi is cold. I hate getting hot sushi.   We always order a ton of stuff and have loved everything. They even had Ocean Trout on nightly special tonight. Woo hoo for us.   We normally don't get Dessert because the menu is so big here and you will leave in a food coma but they did have pineapple ice cream tonight and I desperately wanted to try that. Maybe next week.",

AYCE for every menu item, extensive list of regular sushi options (loved the super white tuna and garlic albacore), really fresh and flavorful special roll options without the usual buckets of sauce. Service was fantastic. We sat at the bar and ordered item after item, chatting with the very friendly sushi chefs and trying new things. Every regular sushi was fresh and with that butter-smooth consistency, but the highlight was the order of scallop - best I've ever had. AYCE sushi is always fun, but it's a real treat when you get really high quality fish and fresh flavor profiles. Topped it off with a green tea mochi and my belly is happy!",

Well we paid $25/person but I went to different ayce with the same price but fish is better. They have the sashimi but it doesn't even taste fish and doesn't even look like a fish, ended up not eating it. Hopefully they will improve their fish quality.",

    "text": "Not sure why there are so many positive reviews!! We went for lunch and the place was completely empty- that should've been the tip off. Our server was a young, bubbly woman who despite trying to be pleasant and helpful, rushed us through our AYCE lunches. She kept taking plates away before we were finished and threatening the \"leftover food gets charged\" policy (we had zero leftovers and I was still working on a plate with a couple pieces of sushi that she tried to take away before I was done!!). If you want details or her name please DM me.  The food was mediocre at best. Definitely not sushi to write home about. The tempura squid was not fresh, really the only thing I liked was the tempura shrimp!! I ordered as much sushi as possible (I love raw fish), but it wasn't that fresh. The ikura/salmon roe was a bit slimy in texture and tasted like it had been marinated in some sake or wine to disguise a lack of freshness. For sushi aficionados, any really quality item was off limits according to the menu (uni, amaebi, bluefin tuna, toro, oysters, etc). Dessert was decent (Mochi ice cream and regular ice cream), but there's a one item per person limit. There are plenty of AYCE places in town so I'll keep looking. I wanted to like this place but felt rushed through the meal and had to worry about so many restrictions (one item per person, off limit items, dinner only, etc) and the leftover policy that it did not make the experience enjoyable. I want to dine somewhere where we and our business are welcome, and where I can sit down and have a leisurely meal and be happy:)",

Prices are reasonable compared to where we used to go and I very much like that they have a children's menu!! They offered a variety of sauces and had a nice selection of sushi!! The staff was very very nice!! Thank you!! And please add low sodium soy sauce!!",

Met Chef Andy, who was a delight and also provided complimentary champagne for my birthday.  - Took a while to take our orders, and for some reason took only the AYCE orders first (majority), and didn't come back to get the a la carte people until much later. One of our party did not get even half of their AYCE order brought to his table, nor was any apology given or ammends made when he brought it to their attention. We did not get all of the AYCE items the waitress wrote down that we ordered. I didn't appreciate being asked who in my party left a poor Yelp review, and nothing done to encourage that person to return. A comp'd meal? A gift card/certificate? Dessert on the house? A birthday card of mine was trashed, not saved by the staff.",

    "text": "Undoubtedly the best sushi I have had in Vegas for many years! With the coming and going of so many sushi places on the west side, it was a real treat to find Hanabi. It was recommended by a friend, and has become one of my regular stops when choosing a place to dine out. The menu has a wide range of appetizers and rolls, some unlike other standard joints. My favorite has become the Coco Salmon roll. Coconut shrimp tempura, cream cheese and cucumber wrapped up in sushi rice and seaweed. They top it with fresh salmon sashimi and that wonderful spicy Japanese mayo. Finally it is topped off with shredded coconut. Can't get enough of this one! The staff is beyond friendly and Andy, the owner takes his time to greet all the customers and take personal pride in the dishes being served. He, himself, was Nobu trained. Any sushi lover knows the quality that entails. Don't forget to try something different here, like the seared pork belly appetizer, or the honey toast dessert. Your palette will thank you over and over again. They stay open until 11pm, so not really too much of a late-night spot, but perfect when you get the craving for quality sushi for lunch, dinner or that late dinner when you're too busy doing other things and don't get the chance to eat until 9pm!",

They only had one server and 2 sushi chefs during the lunch rush...at least I don't think I saw anyone in the kitchen. I believe the owner came in a hour after we were seated and he started helping out so it was a little quicker.   Overall, the fish is good. There's a good selection of cooked and raw items.  You can also order half rolls. There's all you can drink sake as well. I liked the food and thought it was a good choice for AYCE. The benches are a bit uncomfortable so I would try and grab a seat at the bar if you can. I would definitely come back more often if the service was a little better, but sometimes you can overlook that if you have a lot of time on your hands.",

    "text": "First Review from 2016 (5stars): I took my parents here with a Groupon deal they had. It is conveniently located next to the movie theater. Pretty and modern deco inside gives you a clean feeling. Food was delicious and fresh, service was nice and quick. We didn't do the AYCE, and the price was decent with the groupon offer. Definitely recommend the AYCE, it actually includes plain sashimi, not just sushi.   Updated Review: Girls Day out, four of us decided to go out to lunch together. It is hard for us to gather, not to mention on a week day. We manage to do it today and I recommended we come here. What a total disappointment! Other than the server lady was super nice, I really don't have anything good to say. We ordered two AYCE lunch and two AYCE dinner; extra ten bucks of dinner AYCE got us extra four pieces of uni and four pieces of Yellowtail sashimi. Please see the attached images for the portion. Ten dollar difference. Rice was falling apart on all sushi ordered, no fragrance and not sticky. We couldn't even pick it up without it falling all over the plate and table. Wasabi was like a green flour paste with no spice to it. We started trying plain wasabi and not even spicy, all four of us was surprised. My girlfriends all complained the small fish portion on all sushi rolls ordered as well. Wow! What happened Hanabi??",

First night was Wife, 4 year old, toddler, uncle, aunt, and I for dinner after the indoor playground across the parking lot around 6 on the Saturday of memorial weekend. There were about 4 open tables and a few seats at the bar, so we were seated immediately. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and attentive and knew we were there to feast on some AYCE.   My kids love Udon noodles so we ordered them with the drink order and they were very content slurping them up off their plates while the grown ups enjoyed a buffet of nigiri and rolls. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri is slightly more than what you would expect to get for $25 AYCE.   On the Sunday night of memorial weekend, we made reservations for 10 people around 6 and met up for another round of \"stuff yourself silly with sushi.\" This time around we tried a bunch of appetizers in addition to nigiri and rolls. The staff was excellent again. Definitely on the list of places to suggest when figuring out where to eat.",

My only two complaints would be that the cucumbers are cut way to big and also it's weird that you can only get one item for dessert. You would think that they wouldn't mind giving you two scoops of ice cream since maybe you will fill up on cheap ice cream instead of expensive fish. But besides that it was great.

We ordered two kids meals for the kids while the hubs and I had AYCE dinner. The rolls we ordered were good!! Honestly forgot the names, so I am sorry for not being helpful with that part. Between us two, we also ordered the shrimp poppers (bomb), oysters (fresh), sweet shrimp, calamari, shrimp and soft shell crab tempuras (all yummy), baked mussels (good), sauteed spicy chicken (okay), and enoki mushrooms (I never even got it haha).  Two stars docked because...... the service SUCKED!!! My husband's rice took the longest to get to our table, and everything else already took long to arrive. Mind you, not even many customers were there. I can't imagine if the place was full. I understand, quality food takes a while, but this was ridic! Even after the owner came out and we complained to him, he said he was pushing our orders out asap..... uhm. Nope. Same shit! Took forever and they'd keep forgetting our orders. I never even got my darn Enoki.",

Pros: -Small nigiri cuts, but also small rice portion...fair balance -Halibut on the nigiri menu...YES! -Shrimp appetizers done 3-4 different ways -Overall good quality of fish -They have a loyalty card where your 11th is free  -Honey toast tasted better here than at Sakana and the ice cream wasn't rock hard -Friendly owner, Andy, came to ask how everything was...also friendly servers  Cons:  -I miss all the no rice sushi options that Jjanga and Sakana offer, they only had one on the menu and you can order it once as opposed to other places that give you 5-6 options to order (and I order them all) -They had two specials written on the board of which you could have one of each...they were out of one, so I figured they'd make up for it by allowing me to order two of the other. Nope. -Haven't found my favorite roll yet of the comparatively limited choices offered, but I'm a nigiri guy anyway... -The raw oysters need a small dab of cocktail sauce or sirarcha or something for flavor ...someone else pointed this out in their review...gotta make that happen  Anyone moaning about the $28 price tag for dinner...if you do the math (and you like the place) it comes back into the $25-$26 AYCE dinner price range...completely in line with the rest of the AYCE sushi joints in Vegas.

It did not taste fresh like you would think, there was a black spot on one of the white fish pieces. The seaweed salad did not taste fresh either. So did not finish that.

It was overly spicy and fishy tasting. No where on the menu does it says that it's spicy! Then we asked for gluten-free soy sauce and fresh wasabi- we were told the wasabi is $3 extra charge and said OK. In addition the two regular rolls that I ordered had a ridiculous amount of rice and very little fish inside. Upon receiving our bill we were charged FIVE dollars for the fresh wasabi and $2 for the gluten-free soy sauce! Are you kidding me? We paid because we couldn't wait to get out of there. The chairs are uncomfortable with no backrest, and the music is loud and obnoxious. They need to get their act together if they want to last. The entire hour we were there there was only one other table that filled up.",

The service was good, it is one of those restaurants with a team serving mentality. All of the servers would check on us and we could order from whomever walked by which was nice. The decor of the restaurant was cute as well.  I had to knock of stars based on the food. I am an avid sushi eater and the quality of the nigiri was mediocre. The salmon nigiri was especially small and thin. The rolls were okay but had limited fish and an abundance of cucumber in them, nothing too great. I do have to say that their unagi was delicious and crispy, but once again small. I ordered honey toast which was an exciting addition to the menu since I've never been to an AYCE that serves that. It was just okay also - it seemed like a hawaiian roll from the market that they drizzled with honey and plopped a vanilla ice cream scoop on.",

Tuna, bluefin tuna, (i call BS on that one. Ive worked with bluefin and the tuna we had was definitely Ahi. Still good though). White tuna AKA escolar, snapper, and yellowtail. They offer a nice buttery scallop, but limited to 1 per order. The hot apps were not as good as some other places that ive been to. The soft shell crab was severly overcooked. The mussels were ok, but still really overcooked. The tempura was well fried. They offer hamachi collar, which i usually like to order, but there was a $4 upcharge for that item so we passed. All in all a decent  AYCE sushi, just as good as most AYCE. they are having a promotion right now for $20. So the price is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Sashimi Salad: OVERPRICED & UNDERWHELMING!!!  I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table.   After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty.  Most sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.",

    "text": "First let me just say that I've been to my fair share of AYCE Sushi restaurants, and this one just did not make the cut, i actually made this Yelp account because i was so disappointed!  Overall presentation of the place is decent, looks clean etc.    We ate here on a Saturday night around 7pm.  Place was a ghost town, so we were seated quickly.  Menu looked promising so we were anxious to try out some of their stuff!  Let me add real quick, that when i go out to eat, i take my 4 year old son with me as well, and EVERY other sushi place i have been to has AYCE options for children, whether its children's pricing or just half off the adult price. They have no such option here, and my son, who LOVES sushi and seafood, was extremely disappointed that he was not allowed any of the things that he enjoys !  It was pay full $30 (adult dinner price) for him, when he doesn't eat that much anyway or order one of the few meals they had designated only for children. He got stuck eating a very plain Kids Meal option. (California roll, miso soup, and 2 pieces of tempura for 8-$10) While i applaud that they have Kid's Meals at all, i wish they would've had an AYCE option for him as well. Some kids enjoy the flavors and variety.  We had some difficulty ordering from the staff/waiter who didn't seem like they spoke very much english, which happens in quite a few sushi restaurants around town, so we didn't think much of it. UNTIL After ordering appetizers and rolls to get us (ADULTS) started, i tried to order Edamame for my son. i asked the waitress if i can get the Edamame A La Carte so my son could eat them.  i told her i would pay for it separately and everything ( Since he was not an AYCE ) and she said no, at which point i was confused and didn't understand why, so i tried asking again. To which she just kind of shook her head and winked at me and said \"shhh\" with her finger up to her mouth.  Either this place is just not KID friendly or the waitress REALLY does not speak English and had no idea what i was saying.  So at this point, before we even got any food i was already really disappointed with the way dinner was going. (we never got edamame for him)  Once food arrived, i can say that it was \"fresh\" in the sense that it was hot and seemed freshly cooked/made.  But the flavors on most of the rolls was quite bland and nothing amazing.  Even the appetizers were disappointing. Its not the worst sushi i've tasted, but it wasn't anything worth commending.  Also, we ordered my sons \"Kid's Meal\" first and his plain California roll came out AFTER almost all of our rolls did! Which just bothered me more...   I think one of the biggest things that irritated us the most was at the end of the meal, we were left sitting there for about 15-20 minutes. They had cleared our table and still had not brought us our check which isn't necessarily bad, but once we did get the bills,  We noticed an added Gratuity. Which most sushi restaurants will add on for big parties. (We had a party of 5 plus the child who did not eat AYCE)  usually 12%-15%, NOPE! this place took an automatic 19%-20% Gratuity out of all our bills, totaling up to about $50-$60 in tips alone.  This irked us quite a bit, especially because we did not think the service or the food was up to par with such a generous TIP!     I will not be dining here again. it was not worth the drive or money.",

    "text": "They say the Japanese eat with their eyes.  A lot of that comes through in sushi preparation and service.  You want your nigiri to be sharply prepared, with tight rice and well cut and presented fish.  When you take the piece in your hand or your sticks, the entire nigiri should be as one piece - a combination of visual flavor and delicious colors.  This was a second choice for us tonight, since our usual sushi joint was overflowing with customers and had a 1 hour wait.  There is a reason for that.  When we arrived at Hanabi, there was no wait.  Indeed, this is usually a positive, but in a foodie town like Vegas, this sometimes means that the fare simply does not match up to a discerning palate, and the punters go elsewhere.  I wish the presentation was better, but I can deal with that as long as the food is good.  Unfortunately the sushi tasted less than fresh, and this was especially apparent in the mackerel, the tuna and the salmon nigiri - all of which are especially unforgiving of poor preparation and in which freshness is paramount.  You can understand why I did not want to try any of the rolls, which are usually designed to mask bad fish behind heavy sauces and creamy bases.  The nigiri had a paucity of quality fish, overwhelmed by too much under-seasoned rice underneath.  The servers were attentive but frequently intrusive - standing around very close by while we tried to enjoy the meal.  Unfortunately, they had to go back to the chef's station multiple times to check on overdue orders that I asked for but only sometimes received.  It did not help that the chef seemed to be more focused on supervising and guiding a trainee or novice chef instead of getting orders out promptly.  Hanabi is a laudable effort but it doesn't work in this part of town.  Unfortunately, all the empty chairs on a normally busy night bodes poorly for this spot.  808 Tapas also did not fare well for the same reason - it could be the unforgiving location with high rents, but also the picky customers in Summerlin.  The Grand Opening sign in December when the restaurant has been open since June also is topic for a laugh.  I wish them well but there's a long way to go to be successful.  My recommendations:  1. Lower your AYCE prices by 10-15% immediately in order to stay competitive. 2. Add Happy Hour specials to include generous drinks along with the food - they don't have to be expensive drinks, well-grade sake is more than enough. 3. Groupon all day every day. 4. You need to get a better sushi fish purveyor.  Something is not right about the nigiri and the sashimi. 5. Include sashimi in the AYCE. 6. Loyalty program to keep the locals coming - buy 4 AYCE and get next one free.",

    "text": "I ordered delivery from Hanabi through Yelp; I've never been to the restaurant.  Generally, I don't think that sushi lends itself well to grocery stores or delivery. Take out is only minimally better. Sushi is not just about the food, it's about the experience.  I also learned to appreciate sushi in Japan, where I lived for 17 years. It follows that I'm unfamiliar with what has become sushi in America. All the different rolls, the decidedly un-sushi flavors, like jalapeno, confuse me! So we only ordered traditional nigiri, no rolls or specialties.  That said, one expects a restaurant to do its best to overcome the inherent difficulties in offering sushi for delivery. Presentation is important, maybe not for showy spider rolls, but for traditional sushi. Ours arrived in typical styro boxes, with no garnish or decoration, no eye to arrangement. Our order looked so unappetizing, I was tempted to throw the whole thing away.  So, on to the actual product. Sushi is not about fish. Although fish plays an important role, undeniably, there are many varieties of sushi that have no fish at all. Sushi is about the rice. It should be very sticky, slightly sweet, shiny, and just about room temperature; neither too hot nor too cool.  The rice that Hanabi served seemed to be nothing more than steamed white rice. It had no cohesion, so the pieces were difficult to pick up. Chopsticks, fork, and bare hands were equally ineffective. And the rice was tasteless.  Any \"itamae\" worth his ginger will tell you that he spent upwards of ten years perfecting his knife skills, and still practices regularly. The slivers of fish we received were poorly cut with ragged edges that made us wonder if the chef's knife maybe needed sharpening. I am by no means a sushi chef, but I could probably have done better with a sharp chef's knife.  Finally, the order came out wrong. Sushi I ordered wasn't there, and sushi I didn't order was.  For the price, which was not in the realm of \"inexpensive,\" this restaurant disappointed with its delivery. But I must again state that this review is for delivery only, and in-house quality may be vastly different. Based on the other reviews here, I may visit the restaurant, but I won't be ordering delivery from them again.",

I got the sushi bento box which included miso soup, ginger salad, 2 small gyoza, 3 small pieces of sashimi, 3 small nigiri, 3 California roll, 4 pieces of fried tofu (or tempura). It all tasted so good too! I'll definitely come back here for lunch. My only worry is that the sashimi and nigiri is way too small. I understand of its just for the lunch special, but if I order an al a carte sashimi it better be bigger! Overall great special and great service too.",

Loud noise just doesn't mix well with dinner.  Either owner allow or so, however church functions just don't belong within restaurant during dinner time.  Sushi rice should be blended with chef's special vinegar mix, instead just stander cal-rose rice which fall apart when pick up every time. Tempura batter bit thick and not really crunchy.   Imitation crab is bit over use, I mean over pile inside or on just about every rolls, and over power by sauces. We can not even taste the fishes.   All and all decal is nice, services is great.. Food needs lots help!!",

However, the quality of the tuna nigiri was subpar. The tuna was mushy and the flavor was off. Additionally, I opted to try their signature roll, the Hannabi and it was just okay. The asparagus on the inside was hard, and the roll completely fell apart. Also, they charge $8 for a draft Stella, which is a bit much!

Rolls and sashimi we ordered at the beginning came until we asked them 3 TIMES, and then once we did get it they forgot the second order, rolls we didn't even order would come to our table, drink rarely being refilled, water was poured in sprite drink, waiter at one point just flat out dropped us for a bigger group leaving us only the bussers that always needed to get him, but the one thing that threw me over the edge was I ordered the honey TOAST and the gave me a untoasted Hawaiian roll with ice cream and when i asked for a new one it came back with BURNT stale breas on purpose. At that point I didn't touch it. When the waitress gave it to me I actually giggled in disbelief and she giggled and said \"its okay now right?\". When we built up the urge to complain the manager smiled and said sorry gave us uncomfortable hugs and continued further. Love the sushi just wont be back with that service.",

This place LOOKED NICE so hubby & I thought we would make a quick stop & have a little bite... the interior was clean & small. The staff was nice.   We did not get the AYCE because we had already ate & just wanted some UNI & SALMON for dessert.... we made the wrong decision... we went in and sat down at the bar since we would be quick.  We might as well have gotten AYCE instead of A LA CARTE since our bill ended up being $45 which $7 short of the AYCE total.... then we could have at least tried some of the hot food to give the place some justice.  UNI $7 - tasted like the scrap part of the uni... the parts of the UNI you can't even tell it is uni... I REALLY don't want to say this but I thought I was eating in a SEWER when I put it into my mouth.  So I had to force down the other piece with a WHOLE bunch of kizame wasabi & soy sauce.  SALMON BELLY - this was their special for the day... hubby said it was super fishy.... this I'd coming from a man that critiques every sushi JOINT solely based on their salmon.... the most common fish that sells the most....  I wish I could go back but if you ruin someone's palate w/ bad uni.... it's hard to go back... the quality was BEYOND hiding behind the excuse of AYCE",

Courteous chefs and a very very very polite hostess made the visit pleasant. Especially after a long day at work. Great spot to come for late night sushi craving if you are in the area. Plus, unlike most kitchens in the area that close 30-45min before they close at 11pm, theirs takes orders until they close it seems! That right there is perfect for us folks getting out of work after 10pm.",

    "text": "Upon scrolling on the Yelp feed I came across this sushi restaurant so me and the beau decided to check it out. This place actually took over where 808 tapas used to be. I didn't know they closed down! Everything looked the same when we walked in though. Maybe different stuff on the walls.  It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away, AYCE dinner was 28$. A little more pricer than the usual. Once you check in you can get BOGO free house sake so I took advantage of that. But I decided plain sake isn't for me.   The fish was pretty fresh. The rice/fish ratio was pretty even. That's always a pet peeve of mine at sushi restaurants. The menu had some amazing new items that you don't usually see BUT they weren't part of the AYCE which was a bummer. They did have oysters on the menu 1 order per person but they didn't have tabasco or the cocktail sauce you usually put on oysters.   The jalapeno poppers were amazing and also the rock n roll was bomb. It's a rice less roll which I love love those! Looking over the menu again I forgot to try the Monkey brains. Dang it.   I ordered seaweed salad, it had a really distinct Taste to it that I didn't really like. I got the green tea cheese cake and it was so small! I had to laugh because I saw pictures of it but didn't think it really was as small as it looked in pictures until it was in front of me.   The service was quick and efficient so no complaints there. 3 stars because it really wasn't mind blowing but overall we had a nice dinner there.",

They do not skimp on the fish- all portions are very generous. They do not overload on rice either.  But what really sets them apart is their delicious and wide variety of kitchen items. I don't know how much work it is to maintain such high quality food of so many kinds, but they do it so well. Try the pork belly- in addition to being so tender and delicious, it comes with mango slaw which was just incredible. We also had octopus skewers which was fun, and the daily special was a citrus fish which was also great (in addition to tons and tons of sushi rolls).  The service was fantastic- we had a friendly and attentive male server who gave us good advice and was super prompt. The lady who seemed like the owner always had a smile. Everyone was really nice.  Protip: we came here 3 PM on a Saturday- great time to get AYCE service as we were the only ones in the restaurant.  We will definitely come straight back here for our AYCE fix. It was also really reasonably priced at $25/person for dinner and in my opinion offered way more than the standard AYCE sushi experience",

    "text": "Alright, so overall, a great place for AYCE sushi. Awesome price.  Sushi- so they call the ngiri sushi, so I will too. The sushi is always great- two tiny pieces (NOT WORTH IT UNLESS YOURE DOING AYCE) I always get 1 bluefin, 2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 superwhite, and a yellowtail. In my opinion, solid food. Decent quality- for 25.99 AYCE, worth it.  Rolls- be careful. If it says habenero, it's not a good roll. The habanero rolls literally have no flavor. They don't put any good sauce, just dumb horrifyingly hot sauce on it. Rock and roll is good, as are the dragons. If it's spicy, be wary.  Other stuff- oysters not good, but what can you expect, pork belly AWESOME, chicken good, jalapeno poppers delicious, shrimp poppers good, ice cream good.   Again, it's crazy that they can sell all that ^ for 25.99 for everything total. That's ridiculously good prices for good quality food. The service is nice and the food comes out SUPER FAST.  Update: when I went here with someone they ordered the shoyu ramen. I tried the broth and it had a really nice, clean flavor, so when I came back, I decided to try the tonkotsu ramen. It came hot, like it should be, and the broth was nice. Noodles were cooked well and tasted like they had just been cooked. I personally prefer thin noodles instead of these thick ones, but whatever. I do have a few criticisms: first, usually they have an egg with a liquid yolk, which is always nice to mix into the broth. Also, the ramen literally had broth, meat, and green onions. Nothing else that I could see. Lots of pork meat, however for some reason it wasn't seared? Normally it has a crispy skin and then soaks in the broth to a crispy outside super soft inside that melts into the broth. Instead, it was just soft.  Now onto the important part: the broth. At first taste I loved the broth. It wasn't a clean flavor like the shoyu- instead it was a thick, flavorful broth. Both broths seem good and different. The broth was pretty awesome. Once it cooled I got a clearer taste of the broth. It wasn't as porky, though... it tasted a lot more chickeny. Personal preference, a thick porky broth is Best, but a thick chickeny broth was good too (it is tonkotsu though... maybe I'm wrong and there was no chicken flavor)? It almost tasted like a super high quality top ramen in a way, very chickeny. Anyway, I enjoyed the broth, just needs a little more. Please sear the pork skin to make it a crispy outside!!! Add a little more into the broth, like some bamboo, to make it more interesting in my opinion.",

    "text": "Very nice establishment for sushi. What brought me in was the fact they have Cajun albacore sushi! I swear, I could order 40 orders of those and I wound up ordering 30 or so? I went during lunch for AYCE and on a Wednesday afternoon it was empty so our service was fast. Their rolls are slightly larger than I'd like but we did our damage. As with any sushi establishment, I would not recommend the panko roll. I can't do fried rolls, but my friends who ordered it could barely finish it- it was too large!   I really liked that they had honey toast for dessert, but their honey toast wasn't so much toast but a honey roll- I wouldn't order it next time.  Tldr; Clean establishment, friendly service, keep the Cajun Albacore sushi coming!",

The only thing that was a little weird is they put asparagus in a lot of their rolls. Not bad, just different. Overall great experience and I'll definitely be back.",

The first thing we noted was it smelled a bit burnt. There was a sour taste that we could only identify as lemon after biting into a few seeds.  The meats were overcooked and everyone, even my 7 and 9 year old children, were hungry after finishing this less than stellar meal. The only bright spot was the miso soup, that was delicious. Don't think we will be back for seconds, even though they leave you with plenty of room for them!",

The atmosphere and decor was welcoming and my father (who I was treating to lunch) was particularly fond of the K Pop music playing on the sound system.  The AYCE (all you can eat) sushi menu was pretty impressive and reasonably priced. $19.99 per person for lunch. We ordered SO. MUCH. SUSHI.  I usually like the nigiri instead of the rolls, and when I received my order, I was BLOWN AWAY by the quality. The garlic tuna salmon nigiri LITERALLY melts in your mouth. The ikura (raw squid) was tender and not chewy.  I could not help but order more of the garlic tuna. It was so good! We also ordered the Japanese lasagna to share and it was perfect. I mean, truly divine. I wish I could remember our server's name because she was so sweet. She was a petite Latina and  was running the whole restaurant flawlessly!",

I got the dynamite nachos or the volcano nachos? Something like that the name is not important just know any nacho/sushi hybrid is bound to be amazing!

They have tables for 2, 4, or 10 and if your looking to sit at the counter-- they have that too.   My sushi was so fresh and tasty. They have so many different rolls to choose from and also a whole list of other dishes if your not feeling sushi.  I thought the prices were extremely reasonable considering the quality!

My friend ordered a refill of tea and they didn't come back 'till the check came.

Speaking of, I ordered takoyaki last second, and it wasn't even on the menu yet, and they made it quickly and it tasted great! Nice and creamy. Now, one of the the takoyaki was slightly, very slightly, cold in the center, which is understandable since I think I may have been one of the first, if not the first person to order it from them. When I told the owner so he could improve it in the future he apologized profusely and even said that he'd give one to me next time I came in! I'll come back next time I fly into Vegas, although it may be a couple of years....",

    "text": "I always love the yelp reviews and I have gained a lot of trust over the years of using Yelp service, for the first time I am doubting the yelp service and reviewers in Las Vegas.  ** Important ** Before I give my reviews, I must say sushi or sashimi (i.e. raw fish) is something we have not tried. We just could not have them, because my wife was pregnant.  Ambience Nice and clean restaurant with a lot of screens, maybe little too many. ****  Service Generally pay attention to our table good. We were in at 3pm so with very few tables to serve, that is expected, but still nice. However, I was shock with what server said. One of the food that we ordered was Cold Soba, after 5 minutes, the server comes back and says \"sorry we are short on cold soup so we will not be able to make Cold Soba\" this was something that my wife really wanted or the baby inside really wanted lol she then continued by saying \"the one on desert inn is good for this\" To me it sounded like \"no one order those and you should go to that one, if you want Cold Soba\" Just sounded very rude. **  Food We ordered Cold Soba, Japanese Hamburger Steak and Baked Salmon Roll. As I mentioned above we ordered Cold Soba, but it wasn't available so we cancelled the order. Japanese Hamburger Steak, we ordered well-done because of pregnant wife. The food came out burnt on the outside and very salty. What does this mean? Instead of cooking in the medium heat for more well-done inside and not burnt outside, they cooked in full flame. Salty means, they just cooked it for longer period of time to get it more cooked without changing any level of sodium or adding water. Hence mushroom and onion that were with the meat was also salty. Baked Salmon Roll had some more expensive ingredients in it, such as cream cheese, salmon and some more cheese on top, but again they could not balanced the flavours. Other side dishes were not best either. Wasabi was pretty low quality or was not stored in right temperature. Iced green tea was green coloured iced water instead of tasting green tea. Salad was fresh, but too much dressing. Overall, the food here is a kind of food that you would find in a mall food court, no expertise or love in cooking. *  Price Japanese Hamburger Steak should be sufficient for $4 Baked Salmon Roll should be sufficient for $6 just because there are some higher priced ingredient in it. So total bill with tip should have been about $14, but instead the bill was over $30 *  Recommend for People who loves watching sports (if they use the TVs as watching sports) and just eating sushi as finger food in unlimited sushi. ($22 for lunch $28 for dinner) Sushi cannot be too bad if they are using sushi rice making machine and putting fish on top.",

I guess my only thing i wasn't too happy about was that there was quite a few items on the acye lunch menu that was restricted to only dinner & only one order person. The chef came by and checked on us during our lunch as well.  Will return in the future for dinner",

We ordered oysters, yellowtail , green muscles , Alaskan king crab, and Toro which was all fantastic! The Sharaku sake was extremely smooth and sweet. My only complaint is that there isn't  6 stars to give to this place!!!",

    "text": "I can't comment on the food so I won't give too low of a rating. But this place wasn't comfortable upon walking in. We walked all the way from the front to the sushi bar and no one really looked at us until we walked out.   The restaurant is clean but that's not a surprise for a brand new spot. The most prominent thing in the restaurant is a chalk board that runs along the entire right wall and is covered with All You Can Eat rules (or All You Cannot Eat rules):  -No sharing -No sashimi -No customized rolls -No a la carte then switching to AYCE  I don't eat shellfish and my wife can't eat avocado. This sounds like a very limiting situation for us. We eat tons of sushi, so it's not normally an issue. I won't list other sushi places on this review, as that's pretty mean. But it doesn't cost much for a restaurant  to accommodate a guest, especially if it's not busy.   Note to owner:  I understand that you're running a business, but it's a hospitality business. Before you worry about your money, I recommend making your guests feel welcomed. I strongly urge you to erase the chalk board on the wall and put up a pretty picture of something that makes your guests feel happy. Put the rules on the menu and people will understand.",

She was friendly, efficient and took very good care of every customer. Sashimis came out fresh and hot appetizers taste excellent! Will come back again, with the family next time. They really do a great job here! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Overall the place was pretty average. Long story short, the appetizers were awesome, the sushi was subpar, and the desert was horrible. The place was really loud too. The prices are also more expensive than other all you can eats and too many items are a la carte only.  Long story long, read on.  First, the restaurant itself. It has a nice, modern, clean vibe and look to it. The staff were friendly. One complaint was the music was way too loud. It was hard to have a normal conversation without raising our voices, so we kindly asked if they could turn the volume down. Instead, the waitress asked if we wanted to move to a different table. Since the volume level is pretty much the same no matter where you are there, that perplexed us and we stayed put.   Prices are steeper here. Lunch is $22 and dinner is $28. That's $3 more than average. Several items are a la carte only that are typically included at other all-you-can-eat places (albiet often one order only), though that have some special items that justify it like real kobe beef. House sake was also $6 for a small and $9 for a large, which is also about $3 more expensive than other places. Note that there is a 2 for 1 deal for sake or beer if you check in on Yelp, so that helps.  Onto the food. They have a decent variety of appetizers, including some with enoki mushrooms which you don't usually see. We tried a wide variety of them and everything was well prepared, well portioned, and delicious. The tempura based items were particularly tasty. We were happy campers so far.  Our nigiri sushi orders came out and our enthusiasm dropped. The quality of the fish was fairly good, but the pieces were fairly small, and the fish was cut very thin. They were about 90% rice and 10% fish. The rolls we received were also pretty stingy with the fish as the cuts on top were equally thin, and the fish inside was small compared to the other filler items. When compared to places like Sakana or Sasa who are very generous with their fish portions, it was very disappointing.  After getting full on mostly rice, we asked for dessert. This is when things got pretty dire. I got the vanilla ice cream with macaroons, and my friends got green tea and strawberry mochi. My ice cream was partially translucent and looked more like a sorbet, like it was dairy free. Worst vanilla ice cream ever. The macaroon also tasted kind of like garlic, which was really strange. I'm guessing it had been stored next to it and the garlic flavor creeped in. The green tea mochi was horrid. The rice covering was crumbly and had a rough texture. The ice cream was neon yellowish green, had a weird texture, and tasted funny. The strawberry mochi was better at least, but not great.  One other minor gripe was with the men's bathroom. The urinal wouldn't flush, and the toilet paper felt like it was from 1970's Soviet Russia. At least it was clean.  The staff were friendly and attentive outside of the issue with the loud music, and one of the chefs personally said goodbye to us as we were walking out.  We give it a 2 1/2 out of 5. Definitely not the worst place I've been to, but there's definitely room to improve, and there much better places like Sasa and Sakana, which are also cheaper. If they do a better job with fish portions, desserts, bring the prices down a bit, and turn the music down, we'll be keen to return. Until then we'll stick with Sasa and Sakana as our main places.",

    "text": "This has been one me of my favorite places to eat sushi for a long time now.. the owner Andy is amazing and very friendly! However today I experienced something no one should have to ever go through. One of the server's ( small lady with glasses) was really rude and embarrassed me in front of my friends that I haven't seen in a real long time today. The situation started because I was taking the rice off of the sushi because Lord knows it was just to much rice on the sushi role.. lol Sorry( I had no idea ..I had to eat all the rice on an all you can eat menu lol! ) She came over to our table super aggressively and told us she was getting us our check with her hands in the air looking exacerbated..I became defensive and replied we are not finished eating and can you please prepare another sushi role. She replied back saying no.. and if I do I will grab you a half a role. I said why?.. she went back in the kitchen where our plates were.. brought it to the front of our table around my friends and other customers!   Saying(you didn't eat all of the rice on your plate!!!!) at this point I was just mortified!!! I replied by saying  if i violated your policy.. pull me aside or you explain that I will be charged more and I would have totally understood! I immediately went over to the chef and asked is this how you treat your customers. He quickly apologizes for her action! He came over to the table to defuse the situation and the bad experience from his employee. Please understand my rant.. This is one of my favorite places in the city to eat!! I tell all of my co-workers, friends, and family to go there. So to get treated like this was horrible! As we signed our checks I guess he sent her to tell us sorry.. but I refused to accept the apology because I knew it wasn't coming from a genuine place ( the boss told her to do it)  Andy no one should ever be treated like this in any of your restaurants... And if these are the people you are hiring, then it says alot about you!  You are the company you keep.",
