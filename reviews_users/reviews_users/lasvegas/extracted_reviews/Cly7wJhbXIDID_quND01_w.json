The menu offers a variety of vegetarian options, but also gives you the option of adding protein so you're sure to get your fill. The employees excel in their customer service. They're really helpful in explaining the menu more in detail, and helping you make your choice by giving recommendations.",

I really like this newer style of walkup ordering and then the staff brings it to the table - I've noticed it more and more. This place does not disappoint. Inside is clean and fresh and bright. The staff was helpful and pleasant. And most importantly, the menu was first-rate.  Grain and veggie bowls included roasted vegetables. The protein options are all responsibly farmed and sustainable. Good sides too. They also serve draft kumbucha and beer.   Everyone had a good meal. Well done!",

Waitstaff is most professional and educated in the quality and prep concerning this most healthy dining experience. The wraps are delicious! Our salads and bowls are  huge and we were able to add chicken or salmon to fit our desires! The children's menu is a delight. Ample seating and parking also add to the experience.

When we were picking them up we watched a cashier that handles money stick her bare unwashed finger in someone else's Togo order and move the food around, and then put the lid on and put it in the bag for the customer.  Luckily not us.  So I kind of ignored that and the following week only I ordered another forbidden rice bowl with chicken.  I got so sick that night and it has been 5 days now and my stomach still is a little off.  I can only attribute it to that bowl and then I remembered watching them stir a Togo with their finger!!  Yuck!  Food was great but no thanks.  Until they clean up their food handling we will not be back.",

Touting themselves as locally sourced, all natural (a meaningless marketing term anyway), and healthy, this \"new age-y\" eatery has many challenges. My biggest peve... their menu says, \"Our proteins are naturally raised... because happy food makes healthy food.\"  Me to manager: Is the salmon farmed or wild caught?\"  Mr Manager: It's farmed. Me: How is this natural? How is a constrained fish a happy fish? MM: The fish are raised in their own environment. They are just restricted. Me: Seriously? Ok, now you're just spinning words. I'm sure the restricted salmon are not \"happy\" salmon.  A note. The server asked if everything was ok. I showed her where it said \"naturally raised\". Her reply was word for word the same as the manager. Someone was coached.  The noise level was almost an intolerable cacophony. No sound-proofing materials on walls or ceilings.  So now the niceties. A lovely atmosphere visually with lots of pastels and artsie pieces. The patio is large and airy. The selection is varied.  I would recomend a visit to make your own decision.",

And I am not big on cutesy or overly curated establishments that focus on aesthetics vs. the food. Also, I have a thing with Summerlin...  That being said, a fancy friend of mine invited me to lunch once at Flower Child and I confess that I've been coming back ever since! I've had most of their small plates, with a couple of misses, but the Brussel sprouts, corn and quinoa and sweet potato were all very tasty. The sauteed broccoli is literally that (and costs 4 bucks for like 6 florets). The soups have all been very tasty, a standout was the chicken and rice. What blew my mind and I continue to order is a Thai cashew quinoa bowl with zucchini, snap peas, cashews, Thai basil, jalapenos and other goodies. OMG it is a flavor explosion, so tasty! I get it with salmon and feel quite good with myself (which is probably how the people in the neighborhood normally feel about themselves).",

    "text": "\"The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Summerlin\"  I had to whip out the laptop to write this review as I was determined it was going to be the best review I will have ever written. I liken this place to the second coming of Jesus. I have never in my existence thought that healthy food could possibly taste as good as it does at Flower Child. Every. Damn. Time.  To put it into perspective, I've been here four times in the last month, twice in the last week. I've made it my personal goal for 2019 to try every single thing on the menu. My girlfriend says she would support me. That speaks volumes, because my girlfriend is not one who usually suggests eating out at a healthy restaurant. I LOVE this place. I love every single thing I have tried on the menu so far. This place has made me fall in love with tofu and seriously consider going vegan just for tofu. I doubt I would be successful though, because of my undying love for cheese.  The first time: Vegan poke- I feel like I was eating a poke bowl without all the guilt. I do not usually pick a dish with beets as an ingredient because I do not like the color of beets, but I was so glad I had this as my introduction to Flower Child, beet-colored poop and all. :)  The second time: \"Forbidden Rice\"- If this rice is forbidden, I would gladly go to prison to eat this for the rest of my life. This dish had so much flavor and so much healthiness that I would be willing to serve a life sentence just to eat it one more time.  The third time: Thai Dye- Spicy!! I would gladly shed tears just to have a taste of this spicy tofu wrap. Mouth and eye watering. We also shared the crushed avocado toast. Simple, yet very flavorful with the egg on top. I could probably make that at home, but I'd rather eat the Flower Child version.  Today: Brussels & Squash- Seriously, does this place have anything that doesn't taste good? This is my fourth try and I have yet to find anything that I don't like. I love the combination of everything in this dish. I was telling my girlfriend that whoever came up with this place, and this dish, is pure genius. Oh man.  I'm already thinking about the fifth visit and what I'm going to have. I'm thinking of the Flying Avocado for next time.",

Every detail is there!  The only thing I wish they had was more Vegan options or an entirely separate Vegan menu  and prepared desserts, rather than just pre baked goods.  A hot brownie with ice cream on top would've made me an extra happy girl. Just saying!  All in all, I'm definitely coming back!",

Sure the ambience is relevant and location is ideal but the layout and execution of the food is near catastrophic. Let's take the $7 avocado toast for example, this can be made at home on the same generic multigrain bread slice from any grocery store and still taste better...why not elevate the experience with a high quality bread slice that someone can't make at home. Other dishes tried were chicken tortilla soup (mostly a light broth overloaded with corn), and the vegan ingredient salad which showcased a Dijon mustard-y flavor beyond anything else. No thanks...2 people for lunch and $40 later, I'd rather enjoy their other sister restaurant next door - NorthItalia.",

Their coconut curry soup is to die for- by far the tastiest thing I have had in so so long, and the salads, wraps are good but nothing crazy or super notable. There can be a line pretty quickly almost always so you could also do pick up if that works better! The staff is not super friendly- just seems like they're trying to do their job and go home, which can be understandable. I've come here a few times because I live super close but if not, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here. The atmosphere is cute and it's an awesome place to meet up with people or somewhere to go if you're trying to be quick, the food comes out super super fast.",

Once I ordered a muffin and they have me an empty container but no muffin. Don't get me wrong, they'll make sure the item is put on the next time I dine, but I still don't like that my order was not made correctly. Once or twice is fine, but every time?

I came at 6pm hoping I wouldn't catch the dinner rush, there was no line and ordering was simple. I opted for the mix and match with grass fed steak, corn quinoa and a side of tofu. They have a little area with their own house made drinks and I was interested in trying them. I went over to the drink area but none of the flavors sounded appetizing but I did try the watermelon mango lemonade. The drink was okay but not a wow factor. The food came pretty fast but one at a time, I feel bad waiting for the other persons food. The avocado toast came and the presentation was off, it also needed a little more flavor. When my dish arrived I was SHOCKED at the portion, I had seen pictures online and it was way smaller than I even imagined. I could eat my steak in one bite! The corn quinoa was flavorful and paired well with the steak. As for the tofu, it had a weird texture and did not have any flavor, which is upsetting because I love tofu anything! I would not recommend coming here if you are looking to be full, its more of a snack or lunch time meal.",

    "text": "So I consider myself a flower child growing up in the generation that I did and have been looking forward to stopping in here for a bite. We had a lovely dinner here on Saturday evening.   Ordering is a breeze, you just walk up to the counter and let them know what you want, grab your number and find a place to sit down. When your dish is ready, a server will bring it out to you. Staff was not overly friendly but you don't have a lot of interaction with them except when you order. I did speak with a staff member while pouring my tea, and she was super outgoing and bubbly. She was educated and helpful with the tea selection.   The dining area is large and you can choose to chow down inside or opt for the patio dining which is what we chose. This place is so bright and airy. Great use of color through out the interior along with the groovy patio. You can't help smiling as you enjoy the good vibes emanating from this cafe'.  This cafe is primarily vegan but you have the ability to add protein to any meal. I chose the Strawberry Fields salad and added all natural chicken. The salad included organic strawberries, wild arugula, shaved fennel, toasted oats, dried mulberry, goat cheese, and the most delicious chia seed vinaigrette. It was a healthy choice for dinner and I also tried their Japanese mango sencha green tea.  My daughter tried the Flying Avocado wrap featuring smoked turkey, gouda, romaine, tomato and avocado hummus. We were both pleased with our meals. Everything tasted fresh and the produce was crisp. The avocado hummus was so tasty! The menu has such variety. They have salads, wraps, bowls and plates. For the kids, they have some healthy choices for them which you don't see often enough at restaurants. They also serve organic wine and some Nevada brewed beer as well.   I will definitely return here often so I can try more dishes from the menu. In addition, you can order food to go and they are offering e-bites!",

The price for what you get can be a little high...which isn't surprising. The mark up on healthy trendy food is actually really sad...  but this review is more about the take out and service.  We have ordered take out twice. Once we got the curried quinoa bowl and the second time each of us got the Mother Earth bowl. Both times portions were much smaller than what you get when you dine in. Presentation is pretty awful and unappetizing as well. My bowl was missing the pesto which is a staple in the dish. I called to see if I could possibly come back and the response that I received was a bit scary. \"I'm not sure what you would like me to do? I can talk to a manager but I don't think we can take it back.\" I literally hung up the phone in disbelief. Who says that to a paying customer? Will I ever come back? Possibly to dine in, but their food isn't difficult to make at home. I am highly against ordering take out from this place. I'd rather eat a kashi quinoa bowl than the slop they throw in a container and make look like dog food, honestly.",

The fresh, healthy menu is perfect for hot summer days and anyone who cares about what they put into their bodies. They have tons of options for customizing orders or compatibility with specialized diets, with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free logos on the menu, making it easy for everyone. Location is super cute and staff are helpful and friendly- when the line is out the door (their lunch rush is no joke!), they expedite by reserving tables in advance.   So far, I've liked everything I've tried- the Strawberry Fields salad is fresh and I love the addition of mulberries, the Thai Dye wrap with spicy tofu is perfect for Meatless Mondays, Skinny Cobb tastes better than the full-guilt versions elsewhere, and the avocado hummus is a must-get every time. Check out the bowls and plates if you have a heartier appetite.   I'm usually a water-only kind of gal, but this is one place I'll splurge for a drink- they have a variety of house-made concoctions with fresh fruit, no sugar, decaf, etc and they've all tasted great so far!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a friend sporadically after helping her with some stuff. This place is mildly away from where we live but i had been wanting to try this since finding out this place from another friend of ours.   Located on the NorthWest corner of Charleston and Ft Apache/Rampart, it sits next to Williams Sonoma on the north end of the shopping center.   Its a very casual place but you can tell the restaurant is run like a high class kitchen. Casual in a sense that you walk up to order and pay, and wait for your food to be delivered at your table, but high class that the kitchen is run with individual stations and timings. Flower Child has plenty of locations across the nation in 7 other states which is amazing and makes sense to be able to pull this size and quality off.   While waiting for our food, i had looked around noticing the details of the place. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Some under a small lip with umbrellas, some under a complete cover with fans. I hope one day we can come here when we have one of those rare beautiful days out and sit outside !   Menu has similar starts, salads, plates (pick one/two/three), bowls, and wraps. Selection of housemade drinks, nevada beers, and wines to pair as well !   As a fan of strawberries, the \"Strawberry Fields\" had caught my eye. With it including organic strawberries, wild arugula, shaved fennel, toasted oats, dried mulberry, coconut, goat cheese, and a chia seed vinaigrette AND opt'ed for an additional of some salmon to it too, i had liked it more than i had expected.   Light, bright, and flavorful vinaigrette tossed salad with a nicely cooked piece of salmon, it was pretty yummy ! I wanna copy this at home XD goat cheese was surprisingly mild but creamy. Dried mulberry and oats added a nice crunch. Wished for more shaved fennel and coconut as it seemed like they were quite rare in my dish.   My friend had gotten the \"Forbidden Rice\" which includes black pearl, red japonica, snap pea, bok choy, broccoli, carrot, onion, toasted sesame, red chili hoisin w/ choice of adding shaved beef or chicken (at additional cost).   Typically not much of a fan of anything but white jasmine rice, and having not so good of a history with wild rice or anything in that nature, surprisingly, this was pretty decent. With the \"typical asian flavors of sweet and spicy\", overall it tasted nice.   My friend and i both wish it was closer to us but its not too bad for me. I don't mind swinging over here once in a while to pick it up for lunch for us. This was like the higher quality version of Cafe Zupas for me but gave a bit more of a lasting impression ! dang now im hungry...",

Ordering was easy. We got our number and sat outside under the covered patio. Hardly any time passed and our food arrived.  I was a little trepidatious about the menu as I've rarely had a great vegetarian meal, this one was awesome. We split a pair of bowls. We had the Forbidden Rice and the Thai Cashew Quinoa. Both were delicious. The Forbidden Rice had a great flavor with the soy sauce balancing out the textures and flavors.  The Thai Cashew Quinoa had a little bit of heat, make sure you have the water ready. All the bowls were awesome. My only regret was that the bowls weren't bigger. I may have to add some protein next time I'm there.",

For context, though, I'm not vegan myself; my sister is, so I can't really review from that perspective.  Anyway, I really loved the atmosphere and decor and all that; it felt very calm & refreshing. I didn't take as many photos as I would've liked, but I wanna note that there were lots of windows, so I loved all the natural light coming in.  I ordered the Flying Avocado wrap and a lemonade, and both were great! I especially liked that there were 2 different lemonade flavors to choose from, and both flavors seemed pretty unique since I'd never heard of either one before. If I'm remembering correctly, I think the first one was some sort of floral/rose type flavor (I tried that one) and the other was apple spice, I think.",

The restaurant was very welcoming like the sort of atmosphere that you would go to moms and have dinner after being away for a while. The service here is stellar and so is the restaurant itself! The chairs and tables are so quaint and homey.   I ended up ordering the chopped veggies salad and the strawberry fields salad. For only $8 the portions are so large. I spilt two salads between myself and my twins, with extra left over. We also ordered the side orders simply sauteed broccoli. The broccoli sides were done to perfect and everything was so fresh. My favorite was the strawberry fields salad the strawberries were fresh and I paired it with a NV IPA beer. Magnificent is all that resonates with this hot new business!",

This place is clean and trendy, and perfect for those who love to take photos of their food- their food presentation is excellent.   I had the Viet salad with tofu- never had tofu with my salad but it was an amazing combo! My mother got the forbidden rice with shaved beef and she loved it. My sister ordered the Thai wrap and it was good- just wish that the wrap was a little thicker (it came really skinny).  I also ordered the Avocado Hummus as suggested on yelp and I'm so glad I did.. it's so good! As for pricing, it may be a few bucks more than regular places but it's well worth cause you're getting quality food. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh just by looking at the dish, and when you taste it you can confirm your assumption.",

I ordered the Cobb salad with so many toppings that my mouth was watering and tomato toast for myself and tofu, mac n cheese, and fruit for my son.   I know I'm hormonal but I nearly cried when I got my salad. It was a huge bowl of arugula with literally two almonds, two slices of cucumbers, and a measly slice of avocado. The toast was tiny and completely burnt. My kids food was fine but just a few bites of food. The only thing wasn't a tiny portion was the salad but like I said, it was 99% arugula. With delivery and tip it was over $30 and we basically got a snack. All in all, I think I received about $8 worth of food. Not worth it at all.",

The menu has a lot going on and offers lots of options for vegetarians (while still providing some meat choices). The staff is super friendly and helpful. And the food is ready fairly promptly without sacrificing quality or freshness.  However, I would recommend they clarify ingredients. They offer two soups: one clearly states mushrooms (among other things) while the other, an Indian curry with lentils, lists what I thought were all the ingredients (sans mushrooms, which is what I was looking for). Unfortunately, the soup arrived at the table,  fragrant and full of mushrooms. I counted two lentils. So I think Flower Child should list their ingredients clearly, particularly for those who might have allergies, in this case to said mushrooms, and also offer two distinct soups, with less shared ingredients. Also, they should probably dip the ladle deeper into the pot since this lentil soup was lacking lentils.   All that aside, everyone was very nice about replacing it. We traded it for the avocado toast, and that was delicious. The black sesame is a nice touch. We also shared The Rebel wrap which has grass-fed steak, onion, cheese, arugula, and a nice flavor. (I would recommend that the cheese is evenly dispersed on the wrap - my half had no cheese, the other had all the cheese.)   Flavors were good and the place interesting enough to warrant another visit. We left with a gf lemon olive oil cupcake, and that was tasty. Thanks to everyone for making the soup situation right.",

I also tried some teas but none of them really caught my attention so in the end, stuck with my usual jasmine tea. Also wanted to try their fresh juice but $7.50 for it hurts. Maybe one day.

    "text": "Flower Child hit the spot today. I had a chopped salad with tofu. My friends had the strawberry salad with chicken and brownie and lemon cake. My salad was perfectly dressed - meaning it had just enough dressing to cover it. For most, it might seem a bit under-dressed, but I like mine that way. I wasn't a fan of the avocado dressing, but it wasn't bad. I might try a different dressing next time.   The only reason I didn't give a five star is because for $4, I got probably 3 oz of tofu, which isn't a lot. I had to pay $8 to tofu... and that seems a bit outrageous, considering 18oz of organic tofu cost less than $2. So, my salad cost $16 for a regular bowl due to the double tofu. I could go to Wolfgang pucks and get an amazing salad for $20 with wild salmon on the side. At Flower Child, if I had gotten a side of salmon, it would have cost $15 which is less than what I paid with double tofu. Even if they had to grill it. There really isn't much to do. It's a better deal for salad if you don't get tofu and get chicken or something else.   Otherwise, I think this is a great place. Everything seemed fresh, and the staff were super friendly. I'd go back, but would make  different selection.",

There will never be enough healthy restaurants in our area that taste great and have an enjoyable atmosphere. Try this place!  There is a poster of Twiggy on the wall in the dining room that just shocked me. Life is great and enjoy the flower children.",

    "text": "Flower Child is my new favorite! I've been going at least twice a week since I discovered it. Such amazing options and such a diverse menu with every diet to choose from including low-carb, vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free menu options. I generally get the 2 or 3 side plate and add a protein and I am always more than satisfied. I have been wanting to try the wraps, but haven't gotten around to it...they do look amazing though from what I have seen through the open kitchen concept at Flower Child. The restaurant is beautiful and the teas are great as well. My favorite sides are the brussel sprouts, green beans, and the sweet potatoes. They all have great flavor! My only complaint is that the proteins are extremely plain and lack flavor so I always have to ask the kitchen for some sort of dipping sauce...so my tip would be to skip out on the protein or ask for the sauce like I do until they update their seasonings/marinade.",

The lemonades are very good. The portions are small, I guess that's the healthy aspect of it. The avocado toast has a very thin layer of avocado and a lot of eggs and cheese. I was disappointed. For the ingredients and amount of calories I could go to north Italy across the parking lot. At least there I am not being lead to believe that I'm eating healthy when I am not. Lol",

We got there around noon and parking was terrible. I would recommend ride sharing when coming so you can get dropped off right in front. Normally I'm not a fan of restaurants that have you order before and then find a table, but they made it super easy and helped us find a table outside. I ordered a plate combo with Mac and Cheese, Asparagus and Salmon. To drink I went with the seasonal basil lemonade which was delicious. Everything on my plate was good, but next time I will get the asparagus without the ginger. This was probably the best salmon I ever had -- it was cooked perfectly. Restrooms were clean and private and the decor overall was super cute. I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "I was super excited when this restaurant opened. I love healthy options and this place is just beautiful. Unfortunately, our food and our experience was lack luster.   When my husband & I came in the front was very unorganized. People just kind of standing around everywhere not knowing where to order, if they needed to seat themselves or what was going on. We waited about 10 mins just waiting on people to figure out what they were doing and order before we could get to the woman taking orders. The girl was not very welcoming and didn't even really greet us. She just stood there waiting for us to tell her what we wanted.   The restaurant was about half full when it comes to occupancy. We waited fifteen minutes for our food to get to us, which was fine but all of our food did not come out. I actually had to look at our receipt to make sure the order was correct, which it was. We ate what we had for another 10-15 minutes and after no one brought us the rest of our meal I had to actually walk up and ask where the food was. The waitress I stopped apologized and got us the rest of our order fairly quick and she was very kind.   When it comes to the food everything was good, except for the beets my husband had in his bowl. They tasted like straight vinegar, so we had to push those to the side. I got the steak, garlic mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese and the Parmesan broccoli. Everything was actually incredible, except for my steak. First off it was extremely small, like 3 oz worth of steak and I know my portion sizes. Also, the cashier stated it was be cooked medium but it came out well done and chewy. The drinks here are really good. I really loved their teas!   Overall I'm not sure if I'd try this place again. I love the decor, the ambience and some of the food but my overall experience just missed the mark. Having a healthy option in town is great, especially since my husband & I are heavy in the health/fitness world competing, personal training & him running a local nutrition store but I feel like it's just not worth the time or price to come here. I expected a lot more.",

    "text": "Decided to come here since some members of my family were on a diet - this place is great if you are on one. Healthy and delicious, but you can still stay on track with your macros. I'm going to say it straight, the flavor is BIG, but the portions are SMALL.   The restaurant itself has such beautiful decor. Hip and modern. It's great that you walk up and order your food, given a number, and you pick a table. So much better than waiting around waiting for servers. Water is self serve as well as utensils. Yes, food comes out quick!   Drinks - mostly teas and lemonades. Most sound amazing! I have to say the teas are on the bitter side because no sugar is added. Totally natural. The Lemonade is more on the sour side.  Food - like I said previously, the food is BOMB. So much flavor, you wonder how they do it and still keep it healthy. I got the Strawberry Fields salad with added chicken - which comes out to about $13-14.  The salads are a generally bigger portion since you're getting so much greens - so definitely more filling than the plates. The rest of my family members opted for the protein and sides  (these can go up to $15+). If you order the steak you only get 4 pieces (4oz approx) and for the chicken approx 6 pieces. We had a plethora of sides. Broccoli parmesan which you don't really taste parmesan, red glazed sweet potatoes - on the sweeter side, cauliflower - crispy and delicious. Can't really go wrong with the sides.   I'd come here if I'm willing to go for something more on the vegetables and good carbs and take a hit with protein. The price kind of will keep me away since it won't fill me up.",

I've only tried the Thai Dye wrap because it's so good, I order it each time I return.  When I take my children, they enjoy the steak from the children's menu.  It does look pretty darn tasty.  My mother is in town visiting, so we stopped by for lunch.  She ordered the salmon and cauliflower.  She said it was so good, that she wants to return next week, before she flies back home.  The counter service is quick.  They keep the floors and tables clean, even though it's a very busy lunch spot.  Employees are all over the place, bringing food & keeping the restaurant clean.  They are also friendly and whisk your dirty dishes away when you're finished with them.  There aren't a lot of healthy places in my neighborhood to eat.  This place does not have the typical menu and has a lot of options to choose.  I also appreciate that they have stevia available for their iced tea.  I always forget to bring my own and most places only offer Splenda type sweeteners.  On my previous visit, the employee taking my order made a personal joke.  I hadn't been there for at least a week so I was surprised she remembered me.  This is a top-notch quick, healthy lunch spot in Vegas :)",

    "text": "I have really enjoyed the food here but my last two visits have left me feeling disrespected and disappointed. My second to last visit I ordered a side of chicken for my salad, which costs around 5$. They forgot to bring the chicken back to my table, so I calmly reminded our server about it. Still, no chicken 20 minutes later. After that, I went to the woman who took our order and reminded her about the chicken. Another 15 minutes passes and still no chicken. At that point I was tired of reminding them about the food that I ordered, so my girlfriend and I left.   At our next visit I presented the receipt and told the employee taking my order (glasses, dark hair, female) about our last visit. She was extremely unpleasant. Reluctantly she decided she would give me an order of chicken. She didn't apologize and was the definition of rude. Our chicken did come but then my keen girlfriend noticed her salad was without avocado, which is one of her favorites. I get up yet again to inform our server we're missing avocado. He informs us that they're out, which the lady at the cash register failed to inform us. He was polite enough and asked if he could replace it with anything but I declined. I'm a very reasonable individual, but this is just unacceptable. I have worked in the food industry and have never treated paying customers in such ways. I'm not sure why the woman at the cash register was so rude and pretentious. It's baffling as I'm an extremely nice guy. That's what makes it worse. Going forward I'll be voting with my dollar and avoiding this place. In the spirit of being objective, the food we did receive was delicious. However, I can't subject myself to this place any longer. Hopefully management can prevent some of these issues going forward. Thanks.",

Add proteins and cheeses are available for those looking for a richer experience but the primary flavors are coming from the dressings and vinaigrette's.  The space is industrial granola yet somehow feels pretty good. Clean and well maintained dining areas even though it is not a full service concept.  We tried the avocado \"hummus\"  crudites, green beans with chili, a salad with lemongrass vinaigrette and herbs, and a bowl with a mix of grains and sweet potatoes etc. for the price the value was good, side of beans maybe a bit small for $4.00. Seasoning was apparent on everything but could have used a little more attention.  Service Team was really great, the young ladies taking orders were brilliant!",

I got chicken with mash potatoes and asparagus. I loved my sides they were very good. My chicken was so so and a little pink around the edges, I NEVER like to see pink on my meat especially chicken. Why didn't I complain or ask the waitress to cook it a bit more... That is where things go down hill. When I first walked in I told the lady behind the counter that I have never been to this restaurant before, normally that's when you maybe explain a little bit or give suggestion, no she was like let me know what you want to order (which it's walk up order then sit which was also not explained.) Then after seating myself I went to the bathroom which was trashed, I was going to tell the girl who brought my food when I got back to my seat but she just put the food down in a hurry and walked away. I needed silverware which she ran to grab but again tossed on the table and walked away. I was never asked if I wanted a drink which I myself had forgotten to mention so I found the water station at the end of my meal. I just couldn't eat that chicken so I walked up where the food was being prepared (a spot I knew wasn't meant for me but come on the waitress kept avoiding my table) and asked for a to-go box which was met with one person ignoring me and the other handing it over as if I was an annoyance. SERVICE. It's as if we've all forgotten what that is! Price: good Portion size: ok Taste: good but Service: terrible and that's enough for me not to want to go back.",

It is in a great location, and the food is healthy.  I do like the fact that they have covered patio for outdoor eating. There are very few restaurants, that appreciate their out door space and make an effort to make outside patio just as nice as inside!   I ordered the \"plate\" option. I got the grilled chicken, sweet cream corn mixed with quinoa and sweet potato. It very cooked perfectly and tasted good! I was very happy that they offer water with cucumbers, free for their customers. I do believe they have different types of iced teas- as I saw everyone enjoying their large cups! When I ordered my lunch, I was asked if I wanted to also order dessert, I didn't get it this time around. However I am very interested to know how their desserts are and how they go along with their healthy theme!   I will definitely be back. I do recommend it to others, definitely nice to try something new, fresh and healthy in Vegas!",

You must check this place out! I should've taken pictures but I was so enthralled with the food.  I had the wrap with steak, caramelized onions and a few other things. Absolutely, melted in my mouth!  I don't live in Vegas but when I go to town I will definitely be stopping here!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this restaurant and plan on coming back soon. The atmosphere was very nice and everything was very clean. The staff was very polite and respectful. When the meals came out they both looked great! We were both surprised; just like a lot of the advertisements restaurants strive for. They both tasted great. I read some reviews about the food being bland or flavorless, but I couldn't disagree more. So many restaurants look for excuses to add sugary, salty, or fatty ingredients to improve taste, but as far as I'm concerned just add calories. Maybe these people would be happier with fast food. All of this wasn't the case here. Both of our dinners didn't seem to have any unnecessary additions, but rather just the right balance of wholesome ingredients. I'm very conscious of my health and diet and this is the type of thing I'd strive to make for myself at home given the time and ingredients. The only downside was that it was a little more expensive than I was expecting, nothing egregious, but worth mentioning. Will be visiting again.",

It can definitely get pricey if you start adding protein but no more than any other sit-down restaurant.  After checking out the reviews here, I couldn't not get the avocado hummus. It's pretty darn tasty though the bread-to-hummus ratio could be better with more bread. The hummus itself was hearty, fresh and a wonderful blend of several different flavors. I'm pretty sure it's made with witchcraft, but the jury's still out on that one.  I chose the wild mushroom pho and added shredded chicken for my main dish and the fresh flavors continued. The broth was a bit plain compared to pho from Vietnamese restaurants but this was still a tasty bowl of liquid sunshine. The other downside was I'm used to pho proportions; this was a bit smaller than a standard pho bowl.  The fresh taste of all the ingredients is really what makes this place stand out, and on a nice day the patio seating can be delightful. If I'm in the neighborhood again I'd stop by.",

Flower Child is quite airy and pretty inside, and the patio setting outside is attractive as well.  Five of us ordered:  - Chicken with Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, and Smashed Organic Potato.  - Chicken with Clementine & Organic Apple and Sauteed Spinach  - Thai Dye Wrap  - Flying Avocado Wrap  - Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon  We liked it so much that we came back for: - Forbidden Rice Bowl - Mother Earth Bowl  Flower Child serves healthy, simple, clean food...one might have thought the flavor to be simple as well...CERTAINLY NOT!!! Especially the Quinoa in the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl that I shared with my love...it is so good that I almost snuck into the back of the house to try and get the recipe. The salmon was cooked perfect. The Thai Dye was wrapped in a house made, whole wheat, flax & chia seed wrap that was warm and soft. Inside the wrap, the main protein is spicy tofu...spicy enough to notice the spice, but not so much to overpower the taste of all the vegetables inside of the wrap.     There is a self serve drink station with some of the usual suspects as well as a couple of lightly flavored lemonades that our girls enjoyed. Napkins, utensils, togo boxes, and bags are all organized right next to drink station...so if you need a box to go for the left over, just go grab it.    Unlike another health-oriented restaurant located across the street, FC's food has a decently good portion for the price...and it is so flavorful! They use local produce and Gluten light ingredients...but you can have many options as gluten free as well, though sometimes for an extra charge in the case of  the gluten free pita for $1.50. Their protein choices are all natural chicken, sustainable Salmon, grass-fed Steak (they serve medium), and organic non-GMO Tofu.    Flower Child is a popular spot right now for good reasons. Make a point to stop by if you haven't already done so.  -2018 review #8-",

    "text": "Lots of healthy/healthier options that taste great, wrapped up in a fun, whimsical space.   Flower Child packs a punch in the flavor department. In spite of the tastiness, the items are generally light and feel-good in nature, so you leave feeling good about what you ate. The portions are a little on the small side, but that tends to be the norm with food in this vein. An adult is typically going to pay $17 - $23 for food, if you're looking to fill up on a normal size meal, though you could spend as little as $9 - $13 if you're eating extra-lite.   Flower Child offers assortments of salads, bowls, wraps, and build-your-own plates. Lots of California, Asian, and Mediterranean influences are found throughout the menu. You could easily come here over and over again and not get tired of the food, based on the numerous options available. The menu is also clearly marked with Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten-Free options to make those choices easy to find.  My love and I came in with our girls and one of their friends. We order: - Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon - Thai Dye Wrap - Flying Avocado Wrap - A Two Item Plate of Sauteed Spinach and Clementine & Organic Apple, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on - A Three Item Plate of Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Smashed Organic Potato, Gluten-free Mac & Cheese, with Chicken as an additional Protein add-on  On a return visit I tried the Forbidden Rice Bowl, and The Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potatoes, and the Mother Earth Bowl. These were a couple of my favorites, though I also really enjoyed the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl, with Salmon.  The ambiance is nice. I was expecting a little more of a hipster feel, but I was pleasantly surprised with equal parts hipster, sunshine, hippie, flowers, and of course, the unavoidable big box modern food corporation overtones. There is a large indoor dining area, as well as a huge patio that includes a large covered, highly-protected portion, surrounded on three sides.   Flower Child is certainly a place I'll be back to.",

You order your food at the front counter where you're given a number and an empty cup to fill your beverage.  Next, you pour your drink at the self serve station and grab your utensils before selecting your table.   Pros - Fresh, healthy food at extremely reasonable prices. We had quick and friendly service as well. The menu has a wide variety of options for health conscious folks. In addition, I liked that there were both indoor and outdoor seating options.   Cons - For beverages there's really only tea, lemonade, water and a limited selection of alcohol. Personally, I like a few more beverage options. Another \"con\" I thought was that you tip your server before you are even \"served\" due to the fact that you pay first. I like tipping after my meal as I gauge my tip on the service I receive.   Overall, it's a great new spot and I will certainly return. Our food was fresh and tasted great --- not to mention you can't beat the reasonable prices!",

    "text": "Great for the taste and the ambience is nice and I feel that after speaking with them about their menu, they say it's 90% + organic. It's not bad if you don't mind paying a little more and getting somewhat small portions.  What made this place a 3 for me was that they said \"we will try our best to not cross contaminate for your gluten free option\" after I told them specifically my girlfriend has celiac disease. This really turned me off and to be honest, it makes me question everywhere I go now. If the menu says Gluten Free, that should mean there are practices in place to maintain that there is no cross contaminates happening so we don't go home and have a flare up, which COMPLETELY SUCKS. This is restaurant 101 honestly, to keep your customers safe. So although they may be an organic restaurant and the food tastes great, I would not go in there hungry and short on cash or with Celiac disease because you're playing with fire. People who are just not that educated on handling something with real consequences for people who cannot have gluten in their diet, SHOULD NOT OWN A BUSINESS. Gluten Free should not be passed off as a \"preference\". It is a legit health concern and the fact that places like this can only try their best to not cross contaminate means they're not Gluten Free. So how can they put it on their menu and charge more for it?",

The decor is adorable and the atmosphere is fresh and bright. The line was long to order but moved quickly. We were able to sit outside on the cute patio and enjoy a beautiful Saturday! Unfortunately my husband ordered a dish with steak and after waiting quite awhile we asked. It seems they had run behind on steak and no one told us that it was taking extra long (most of us were almost finished!) The manager (I think, but sadly I don't know his name) came over and apologized profusely for the error. Not only did he refund the item from our check, he also brought us some lemon cake muffins with a smile! Can't beat that kind of customer service. The food was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to go back again.",

This is their first Flower Child in Nevada. They certainly deserve a warm welcome.  I'm always in search of high quality food that is nutritious and healthy after my workouts. Flower Child did not disappoint.   I was greeted by friendly workers that seemed happy to be there. I was immediately told that if I had any questions about the menu, they'd be glad to help as they admitted that Flower Child has an extensive menu with a lot to choose from. They wanted to make sure I wasn't feeling overwhelmed.   There is something for everyone here whether you prefer to eat vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, gluten free, or paleo. Everything seemed pretty self explanatory to me, so I ordered one of the more popular dishes on Yelp and was given a number to place on my table while I sat and waited for my food. The seating area is comfortable and the decor was nice; boho/hippie meets farmhouse. My food came out promptly.  I had ordered the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with Chicken added (pictured). The presentation was nice, the produce was fresh and the food tasted as good as it looked. My tastebuds have been thoroughly enlightened! I will be back and am looking forward to trying more things on the menu.",

I've been here a few times since it opened and it's never been a disappointment. I've tried the Organic Kale, Mother Earth & Vegan Poke with Salmon. They all been great and I've tried the Kombucha on tap.  Today we went in on Mother's Day and it was the prime time for lunch, but they took care of my mother and I with the line and table. It was great touch to their service and productivity!  Also, Ashley is a great cashier, she has a great personality and has a lot of recommendations on the menu! Definitely going to try lemon cake next time!",

So far, I've had the salmon, Indian cauliflower, mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, butternut squash, the corn quinoa side, tofu, and the brussel sprout salad with chicken.

I got there earlier than her, so I went inside to look at the menu. They had some lemon infused water up front cause it was really hot that day, so that was nice!  They have a lot of healthy choices - bowls, wraps, salads, etc. I got the Mother Earth Bowl and added the salmon option to it. IT WAS SO YUMMY! I wish the portions were a bit bigger, but the colors of the dish and the overall combination of flavors was refreshing and delicious. I got a drink that you could fill with any of their three lemonades or three teas; I think they change the options everyday. I tried two of the teas and they were both good!   The vibes here are really chill and friendly and it's a cool place to sit and catch up over a quick, yummy bite. Definitely recommend!",

Anyways, this is a cute spot and definitely lives up to its name 'Flower Child' as a hippie chic restaurant. The menu is on a board hanging over the counter. You order, pay and then they bring the food to you. Let's just stay I stood in front of the menu for what seemed like forever, indecisive of what I wanted because everything sounded so good. There was options that catered to everyone: vegetarian, vegan and carnivores. So, it was a good thing there was 4 of us in our party because we each ordered something and we all shared. This place did not disappoint! The Indian spiced cauliflower and the Brussels sprouts were amazing! The spices that they used really brought out a great flavor!! The steak was cooked perfectly medium, and the salmon was cooked perfectly crisp on the outside! Seriously, I'm impressed! Everything tasted delicious!! This is definitely a must try, and who knows maybe you'll see Carlos Santana when you come in.",

We came as a group of 5 and only one meal came out. The whole time only one person of all 5 is us was eating their meal the rest of us just had to sit their and watch. We kept waiting and waiting. It took very long. The person eventually finished their meal and they still didn't have any other meal out. Even after the person in our group finished their meal we still kept waiting another 10 mins. I was very disappointed after raving so much about this place and having family from abroad visit and have to wait so long for meal.",

Often, you have to watch out for someone leaving just to dine-in.   But the food... The food is what makes it work. They use quality ingredients and you know you're really paying for good food. While it is a bit of the pricier side of my budget, I will say that I don't mind paying a little extra just because I know my meals are going to be great.   Often, I opt for grilled asparagus, salmon, and spicy eggplant. The whole thing sounds so basic but they have a way of elevating each entree to the next level.   Overall, I would recommend them over and over again!",

    "text": "Flower Child reminds me a lot of the healthy restaurants in Pasadena. Located in a very busy plaza by Honey Salt, North Italia, and Pottery Barn, Flower Child offers healthy food options that's made from scratch and can satisfy even the vegetarian, vegan, or paleo eater. And they use fresh ingredients that can be sugar-free, dairy-free, and gluten-free. So if you want to geek out over healthy food options, Flower Child is THE place for you.   So Flower Child actually has several locations around the US. There's a few in California, a lot in Texas, and some in Arizona. I was able to visit the Las Vegas one with a friend for an early dinner one Friday. With healthy comes a higher price tag that you're paying for dishes, but just looking at the interior of the cafe makes you want to dine-in and order away.   There are soups, salads, plates, bowls, and wraps. All options come with no protein - you can add that on for an additional price per the item of your choosing. I really wanted to get something hearty, but I didn't want to pay too much for dinner. I ended up going with the Strawberry Fields salad ($8) and substituting goat cheese for parmesan cheese instead. My friend ordered the Vietnamese Crunch (also $8), which looked just as tasty. (Menu on-line says $8 but I vaguely remember paying $10.)   If you're dining in, you order at the front and take a number to your table. Utensils and water are all self-serve. Food was delivered to our tables quickly. I think the salad is a decent size. It definitely tasted fresh - I could taste the coconut and toasted oats, but I especially liked the chia seed vinaigrette. This dish is also vegetarian and gluten free, so I felt pretty happy about my meal after I finished. My friend's salad was tasty, too. It has more of a zing when eating it - probably due to the spicy lemongrass vinaigrette.   I kind of wish I ordered some protein with the salad or maybe a bowl instead. The dish was definitely pretty and healthy, but I was hungry maybe an hour later. And I ended up devouring my leftovers from lunch. I still highly recommend checking out this place though. They don't have too many restaurants in Vegas that are similar to Flower Child. And the interior was decorated so nicely - super bright colors, flowers at every table, mismatched yet color coordinating chairs. It's all helps add to the ambience of the restaurant.   tl;dr - Pricey healthy food that tastes good. I would recommend going all out if dining here - since everything is so healthy, you don't have to feel guilty about it afterwards!",

The gal at the counter was so friendly and patient while we decided what to get.  I love the casual \"seat yourself\" atmosphere. We chose to sit on the patio by they back door of the restaurant.  Our food came out so fast and everything was amazing. My husbands steak was cooked to perfection and my Vegan Ingredient salad was delicious. We also got the Mac & cheese (a must every visit!!) and a few other sides. All the food was perfection.  It was casual and delicious!! Flower child is always a good choice to dine in our book!  Oh! And get the cookies!!",

I often have a hard time finding a lunch spot with vegetarian options beyond a spongy black bean burger, so this place was an absolute delight. Majority of the menu is vegan/vegetarian and you're given the option to add a protein (chicken, steak, tofu, or salmon). I didn't add a protein, but my meal was still filling. Some reviews gripe about the price, but I feel like the quality and generous portion justifies spending the extra dollar or two.",

Place gives me Cali/Colorado vibes... guessing because it reminds me of hippies, nature, and happiness. I really enjoyed the fact that they offer out door seating. With temperatures finally dropping in the LV Valley, this is a perfect spot to eat lunch with your crew/date out doors. It is absolutely adorable that they have a Lemonade stand outside for complimentary refills. I love it!  I had their mushroom beef barley soup, crushed avocado toast and fresh coconuts!!! OMG, the coconut drinks were the best! They are legit from an exotic island, freshly presented to you in the comfort of your desert home, no need to be beach side in a far away place.  The reason for the 4 stars is because the soup was not 5 star quality. Everything else is delicious, healthy, and lovely. I felt happy leaving this place. The vibe makes you feel warm and happy so check it out, you won't be disappointed!",

They have a dog friendly patio and other cute touches like yoga mat parking.   For food I had the Mother Earth bowl with tofu added. It tasted AMAZING. The ingredients were all very fresh and all of the flavors blended well together. My only complaint would be the price, it was pretty expensive for what it was. I get it that all the ingredients are top notch, but I'd definitely come more often if it was more affordable.  You still have my heart Flower Child and I can't wait to try something new. I'd love to see more kombucha flavor options.",

Today, my friend ordered the pho and realized he wanted to change it to Mother Earth and the cashier says it's too late but he can order it to go... what? I've never been anywhere where the customer wasn't accommodated. I work in the service industry and customer service isn't handled that way. He basically told us too bad eat what you ordered originally just because he rang it in. All he had to do was void the order, or the product was the same price, I'm sure he could've told the chef since he was too lazy to void the original order and start over.   Next time I think I'd rather go to vegenation instead.",

    "text": "I stop here for take away a few times a month. Love the ease of their menu & offerings. Every time I order I include the skinny Cobb salad (I adore the dressing). About half of the time my order is made correctly, the other half of the time it's missing ingredients. I'm baffled how they can manage to mess up an item with such few ingredients, but it's a let down every time they do. I'm finally writing a review because on top of them leaving out ingredients in my salad today, it was full of browned romaine. My advice would be to double check any to-go orders to avoid a let down.",

We are a busy office just 5 minutes away, yet on multiple occasions we have been delivered someone else's order, and once, the food was never delivered! Management keeps apologizing, but their corporate office needs to step in and change delivery vendors -- every time there's a delivery mistake, we lose time, get billed for food not delivered/wrong order, have to go through management all over again, etc. Not worth it. As much as I like their food, we won't be ordering delivery until their management gets it right, which is a shame because we place orders for hundreds of dollars worth of lunches every week.",

The dining area was a bit chilly, but the sun shining in through the large windows made it livable. I ordered a plate with Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and spicy eggplant for $9. My mom got the avocado toast, which comes with some kind of white shredded cheese, a medium boiled egg, and sesame seeds on a slice of warm and toasty grainy bread. The best item on my plate was the eggplant, which was spiced in a Thai style with some pepper slices and a sweet and hot glaze. The Brussel sprouts were filled with lemon yuzu flavor and well caramelized, but I found them to be a bit salty. Otherwise everything else was seasoned perfectly. Free cucumber lemon water at the front was the perfect accompaniment to our fresh and reasonably light lunch. Will definitely be back when I'm in town again.",

The cashier was very apologetic and went several times to check on it. I saw her approach a supervisor who apparently didn't think I was important enough to address in person. If you eat in, you get your food fast! What is the difference if it goes in a container or a plate?  The portion of hummus was smaller on my take out.

She's a short Hispanic looking woman and she drives me NUTS. You wouldn't think the back of house employees would even be seen much or heard by us trying to eat, but my GOD, she is extremely unprofessional. She was speaking and cursing so loudly about other employees, I assume, on more than one occasion. I recently heard her vulgar screams from the cooking area again that my son and I just had to pack up and leave. We did return a couple days after this incident, and she was passing through the entrance cursing loudly and was still talking smack about who knows what!  She needs some therapy, beer, d*&^, a Valium, SOMETHING. I do not know what's going on in this lady's life but I don't want to return because she makes me dread going there. Flower Child now seems like it's got an incredibly low, unprofessional environment because of this woman. The girls up front and the servers have been great, and the meat and sweets specifically are so amazingly tasty, but I'd rather just learn the recipes myself than hear that unhappy lady again! I really wanted to be a regular here, but I would never allow any of my employees act this way in my place of business. You think you're Gordon Ramsey honey, but you're not!",

The steak is delicious and the Japanese eggplant is out of this world.  And I've never had better quinoa anywhere else. My favorite part is how reasonably priced the kids meals are and it's basically a smaller portion of the regular entrees and sides, as opposed to the usual boxed mac n cheese, chicken nuggets, burger or hotdogs you find on most kids menus at most places.",

Good energy and service, but the food just doesn't do it for me.  It's not bad, just nothing I crave.   Just a simple, overpriced lunch in a chain restaurant that tries very hard to be cool.

My favorite is the curry option, had chicken to it and it's really on point. Very healthy and well prepared.  The salads are also excellent, very fresh and a lot of different options. If you want something quick and healthy, this is a good option. If you have a sweet tooth, their baked goods are really really good. Great vibe in the restaurant, and also very easy to take out. Well worth visiting this excellent place.  Tip: go for the different lemonade options. Very refreshing and perfectly made.",

On my first visit, I dropped by for some take-out lunch, and I was incredibly impressed. This restaurant is a chain running throughout the Southwest, and I absolutely love that Las Vegas is getting more dining spots with great design.   Since I didn't have much time, I grabbed a quick bite to-go. The Mother Earth bowl (not pictured unfortunately) was an incredibly filling and affordable dish. A base of rice was complimented by avocado, sweet potato, portobello mushrooms, greens, and a lot more. I felt like I had my fill of healthy food for the week, and I actually loved it.   The menu is simple, with lots of healthy and seemingly tasty options. Next time I come, I think I will have to do a yoga class before-hand. I would love to know how it feels to be a full-circle healthy gal!",

So food is pricier but less tasty and hopefully better for you... if I have the get my own silverware eh, that's just not gonna make me too excited.

I knew Flower Child would look at me cross-eyed if I attempted to return it, so I fought through to finish it. So sorry I ordered 2. Immediately after consuming it \"I did NOT feel good.\" Racing heart, slight headache (which I never get). So as soon as I arrived home I took my blood pressure and sure enough it was SCARY! 160/105, heart rate 94! What I feared was TRUE. I drank plenty of water to attempt to wash out the salt. I THREW THE OTHER SOUP IN THE TRASH! Just 2 days prior my blood pressure was good at 135/90, heart rate 78. Examine my Flower Child receipt and you will see that in approximately 2 hours that shit soup almost sent me to the Emergency Room! Is Flower Child's too salty soup against the Board of Health?  Other than the STROKE SOUP, Flower Child does have some delicious dishes that are not dangerously salty.  One other area they can improve on is the Women's Restroom, because the non-handicapped stall is so small you are SURE to rub your leg on the toilet or have your purse accidentally fall in the toilet, as there absolutely NO more than 1/2\" clearance between the door and the toilet...terrible.

There are a ton of options- salads, wraps, even ramen (which was not bad) AND if you don't add a meat protein (an additional $5-$8), you can have a very reasonably priced lunch. They also have some pretty great lemonades and unsweetened green tea that I would recommend to get. Service is also great.   Now the reason for the 4 instead of 5 star. I get it - eating quality ingredients is expensive. Health is wealth. All of that. But when I am spending over $20 on lunch for an entree and a drink - in comparison to other lunch spots, I do find it to be on the pricier range.   The food is good. I enjoyed my rebel wrap and was full but it wasn't like $15 for a wrap good. There was a ton of steak in there, the dressing and arugula were good but the portion for the price is whatever. The ramen is also good. Great for non meat eaters. I did add chicken to mine, which was tender (reminded me of sous vide chicken) but my noodles were undercooked and clumped up at the bottom of the bowl. The broth was fine and I would probably think about eating it again but I also spent like $16 on it.   The food is great for the gram. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing. It's super clean. The service is great but the food was just not my thing.",

For starters, I feel that this place is very affordable for what they serve. If I'm not mistaken, a lot of their foods are vegan/vegetarian and that usually signals that the prices are going to be on the higher side. But not here! I ordered the Healthy Kids (they didn't mind me ordering from it even though I'm older than 12 lol). I chose the chicken protein with broccoli with parmesan and the gluten-free mac n cheese. For being a kid-sized portion and the price, I was very content with my meal. They were very generous with the portions and the food tasted great (especially the mac n cheese!!) My cousin ordered two plates: the sauteed spinach and sweet potato with tofu and she was very happy with her order too.  The inside is very spacious and a great place to hang out with your friends. There's a lot of seating so I don't imagine that you'd ever have to wait. I loved the decor and earthy theme that they had.  I can't wait to come back here and try their other dishes!

If you're trying to lose a few pounds, then Flower Child is definitely for you since the portions are small.    I don't know what it is about this place, but I always leave feeling better about myself and extremely hungry.  There's no doubt about it.  Flower Child specializes in \"clean\" healthy dishes.  They also do a great job serving delicious food.  The menu is kept simple. They have a few apps, salads, bowls, plates, and wraps.  Everything that I have tried has been good and worth it if you don't mind the small portions and expensive price tag.  Bird is the Word is my go-to meal here.  It's a wrap made with grilled chicken, broccoli, and cheese.  This wrap is big enough to be snack, but too small to be considered a meal.  But like I stated earlier, the portions are small and extra protein for an additional cost is highly recommended.  Overall, I'm a fan.  I just know better to have a few extra calories before dining here.    2019 Yelp Review #24 .",

    "text": "In a nutshell: Fantastic food, wonderful, chill ambiance.  This place is beautiful inside and out. Inside was buzzing with happy people. The kitchen is open and guests are able to see food being prepared. There is seating outside, and food gets brought out to you. Ordering is done at the counter from a huge diverse menu. One thing that stood out to me was EVERYONE was smiling. Guests, staff, everyone. The energy of the place was electric yet also calming if that makes sense. The menu has a ton of options, and is suitable for vegetarians, vegans, GF people, and meat eaters as well. I had the steak wrap and the flavor was something unexpected, earthy, clean, and delicious. Perfectly put together, not too much of any one thing.  I will definitely return and will definitely recommend to friends .",

    "text": "I love Flower Child. If I could afford to eat there everyday I would. However, that is definitely one of the cons, you can spend a good $20 with a wrap, a cookie and a drink easily on just yourself. However, the food is good. Sometimes the turkey wrap that I get is dried out but I end up always ordering it again because the avocado hummus is too delicious! My main attraction for coming here is that I LOVE their chocolate chip cookie. They use coconut flour, etc. so if you have allergies make sure you check the ingredients first! The line can be a bit of a wait to order, but you can also order online if you are on the go. Seating is never a problem since they have plenty of patio and indoor space. The bathroom is cute and the vibe of the place is my type of place to hang out at. They have a bunch of different drinks that you can order too plus alcohol.",

I came with a friend that comes here often , we came in and ordered our food. 50$ ok not bad, plus a 10$ tip for a self serve restaurant, No biggie. So we sit down and grab drinks .. our appetizers came and i asked \"Hailey\" for it utensils and she pointed to the back and said \"they are back there\" and walked away rudely. No big deal i got up and got us both silverware. She was Extremely rude , no smile when delivering food . Her hair was swinging everywhere and not tied up. When i ordered my food i asked for butter and lemon , Hailey then again pointed to the lemon in the back of the room as her next stop was a table near the ice machine . Just ridiculous! I will not be back !",

The prices to add protein is pretty high, 6 dollars to add 5 very thin slices of overcooked steak or 7 to add a tiny piece of salmon to an entree seems steep.   This place also serves the latest trendy food item... avocado toast! Nothing like 8 bucks for a slice of bread with half an avocado on it! However, I gotta say flower child has the best tasting and generally the best avocado toast I've ever had. They put a soft boiled egg on top and man oh man ... It's a game changer!",

I've enjoyed several of the salads, soup and my most favorite is the plate option. I usually get the salmon, sweet potatoes, and mac n cheese. I could literally eat this particular meal at least once or twice per week. The juice is made fresh daily. They have a carrot and ginger juice that is refreshing and should be bottled and sold. If I knew what days they had this juice I would drive there just to get it every time.  The pricing is decent. Less than restaurant pricing and more than fast food.",

In other words ramen isnt there specialty. The broth was good and vegan. The noodles were thick and kinda chewy. The pickled cucumbers were not a good addition to this dish and recommend that they dont pickle it or that they replace It with a different veggie.   There are definitely a few more items on the menu that look appealing and this place seems to be a local favorite in this area.   The staff were very nice and attentive.   Overall I would definitely back to try other dishes.",

I ordered the strawberry fields and made a few changes.  Not a fan of arugula or goat cheese, so I substituted mixed greens and feta.  I also added almonds and pistachios.  The chia dressing was very good!  Overall I love the food and service.  The biggest negative for me (and the reason I didn't give five stars) is how LOUD it is there.  I eaten both inside and out on the covered patio, and the music is so loud it was hard to have a conversation with friends.  I'd recommend this place for fresh healthy food and hope they adjust the volume of there music soon so I can enjoy my company as well.",

I love that it has healthy and delicious food and many options for people that are vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, paleo, etc.   It's my go-to lunch spot during the week and I always suggest this as a spot to meet with friends as well.   The gluten free mac and cheese, smashed potatoes, steak, brownie and lemon cake are definitely worth trying. I also love the glow bowl, but I think it's seasonal and isn't on the menu anymore. The vegan ingredient salad is yummy and would recommend getting the spicy eggplant and butternut squash if you're looking for healthy sides.  I'm so happy that they have organic wine as I always get it to drink at home, but can rarely find it when I eat out. If you don't drink alcohol, the ice tea is a great alternative!!! If you're debating about trying out this place, I'd highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Flower Child is the new hot restaurant in our area. We have tried it a few times (including opening week) and each experience has been fantastic. It's a fast casual concept, so you seat yourself and get your own drinks, but food arrives to your table quickly.   The decor- bright and colorful. Great indoor and outdoor spaces, with comfortable seating.   The staff- really friendly and always greets you with a smile. They have been able to describe menu items and make suggestions based on our likes.   The food- so awesome. We have tried several items and each has been worth returning for. Some of our favorites are the thai cashew bowl with salmon, the avocado hummus, and the mac and cheese.   This is one of our new favorite spots!!!!!",

Decided to see what the hype was all about with this place and I'm totally with the hype on this one! I'm big on the atmosphere of places and this place just gave me all the healthy, new, fun, friendly, market place vibes! Lol this place was super modern rustic totally Pinterest worthy. With as busy as it was there was no shortage of indoor and outdoor seating!  Now the food...SO FRESH. Everything tasted like it had been pulled right out of a backyard garden, seasoned and cooked to perfection, and served beautifully on your plate! I'm sure when some people think \"healthy restaurant\" they associate little taste/joy out of eating well, but this place has both the \"good for you\" and \"tastes good\" on lock. The fact that Flower Child is vegan friendly too is a HUGE plus for us!  *Love this place to pieces, just a tiny bit pricey - I assume it's due to all the freshness - but it won't keep me from coming back!",

I've been about 4 times now, and tried about half the menu. I love some of the creations they have, however my go to is the create your own plate. There are so many options! You can have 1 single serving of broccoli, (which is my fav with the parm-garlic-lemon crust), or you can get creative and have brown rice, avocado, salmon, and green beans. So many lovely meals to be discovered!  I indulged and had a glass of wine on my most recent trip and even that was organic and of high quality.  The prices are reasonable, everything is recycled or recyclable, and they even offer non paper straws that are still not plastic! How's that for not cutting corners?  One last tip, mix the flavored lemonade and black tea. Just do it.",

Since I worked at a school and have a very short lunch break my coworker called in our order around 11:10 and asked that it could be ready for pickup at 1:15. All day looking forward to trying my meal from here, we both were actually. At 1 I decide to head over to pick up my food on my limited lunch hour and guess what? It's not ready. My order hasn't even been put in. There was no explanation, no apology. I had to get back to my students and now I'm leaving without my lunch.   Back to Shenker I go and hope that there's an extra lunch because this establishment has wasted my lunch break. So thank you for not only ruining my lunch and not providing it but also for wasting my 30 mins that I get off. Definitely letting people at the school know not to go here and letting them know about the horrible customer service.",

You order,  get a number, the server brings your food over and a semi self serve service with everything you need on the shelves in the back. You can customize your sides + protein or get one of their many dishes. The open kitchen let's you see everything being whipped up fresh from scratch.  The food itself is simple but made with good quality, you can really set the difference vs Skinny Fats. Portion and quality are well worth the price.  Everything we had was delicious.",

It has really yummy pesto, and a great acidic flavor. They also do a really good job of cooking the tofu so that it's not rubbery.

They have lots of vegan and vegetarian options that look super tasty. I tried the Thai Dye wrap with spicy tofu. it was really spicy and tasted amazing. The ingredients are fresh and it didn't take long to be ready.   The few things I would comment on are just how the staff interacted with me. They didn't seem to care very much and kind of rushed me through my order. I wanted take out-but the person who took my order rushed me out so quickly she had no idea. They were not super busy-so i was a little irritated to see she just wanted to continue her conversation behind the counter.   The hostess also had very long hair that was free to roam about her head and she went back and forth between where the food was being prepared and the register...mmm i'd rather not.   Though i will return...it's because the vibe and food are independent of the front of house staff. I'd say it's worth checking out...maybe call in your order.",

If you haven't been here before, there's two lines: one for take out and one for sit down dining. You order your food at the counter and you get a number. It's open seating! I bet the patio seating up front is great during the spring time when it isn't 100 degrees outside.   I tried this place out for restaurant week because they had a 2 people for dinner for $40. Which is like getting a cookie and a drink for free. Both my friend and I came here together for a double date and my friend ordered first. She was offered choices for everything as far as soup and drinks. I specifically heard her offer kombucha to her. When it was my turn to order, I told the girl that I would like the kombucha to drink and she said that it wasn't part of it. I was like ok and opted for wine. My boyfriend and I were not offered the same options yet we were also doing the same restaurant week offer. To make things worst, they ran out of cookies and offered $5 vouchers to be used the next time.  As for the food, we tried the steak and the salmon serving. We tried both of the soups: curry and chicken soup. Their chicken soup was just broth with a shiitake mushroom. The curry cauliflower soup was rather tasty. The steak was cooked perfectly but it was tough and chewy, even though it was medium rare. The Mac and cheese had a very unique flavor and texture, which I felt indifferent about. The salmon was pretty good. I enjoyed the vegetables with it.   The best part was their cookies!!! My friend shared one with us and they were really good.  I give 3 stars to the cute ambiance, the salmon, and the cookies. Take down 2 for bad service and tough steak.  I hope to give this place another try. Hopefully the service improves and treats everyone the same.",

Flower Child nearly does everything better than most healthy places, introducing an environment to lift the spirit with its decoration, open kitchen, and so much more - all the while maintaining the charm of a healthy place with an outstanding menu.  Despite the cost going up as you start to include additional items to your dish, this place is a well oiled machine.  You can see anywhere from 15-20 people working all at once.  But Flower Child is much more than just a place that pushes your meal out to you quickly and efficiently: they are run by, through my observation, awesome and good-hearted people.    I don't know where to begin with that.  Maybe with a personal story.  Growing up as a child, I remember one time where my mom brought me to her workplace because no one was able to watch me at the time.  But her boss had sent us home even though I was behaving!  Okay so back to the people who run Flower Child, I believe I once saw a mother working on the line while their child was sitting out at one of the tables in the restaurant, I could be wrong but I don't think I am.  I want to say that I even saw the person in charge bring the child a drink!  I'll continue to come here at least once a week and have started to branch out on the menu, not.  I still love my Mother Earth or Forbidden Rice!  Cheers Flower Child!",

    "text": "Never in my wildest hippie dreams did I think a place like this would ever exist in Vegas. This has got to be one the cutest, hippiest spots I've ever seen. The green decor throughout and flowers everywhere has to be every influencer's dream. I don't take myself as an influencer, but if I were, I'd definitely be making my Instagram boyfriend take shots of me throughout this place.  One of the best parts about this place is that is almost runs like a casual, sit down restaurant. You go up to the counter to order, but then wait staff will bring all your food out to you, so you don't have to be listening attentively for your name. They also have a separate line for to-go and online orders (order online? LOVE!). I popped in here inbetween meetings and as I'm not a Summerlin local, I just had to have it today so I opted for the to-go line, which went rather quick.  I decided on the flying avocado, and don't worry, it's not actually flying. Only sad thing was that they ran out of wheat tortillas, but honestly, probably a good thing for me. I opted for the gluten free tortilla, which to be honest, I've always hated gluten free anything. Not this time. This tortilla truly tasted like it had all the gluten in the world (can you taste gluten? I'm not sure, but most gluten free tortillas and pastas I've had have been gross beyond reason). It was absolutely incredible. The flavors all complimented each other - gouda and avocado - what a beautiful combination. One the side, you get mixed greens with their house vinaigrette which I am now desperately needing the recipe to. It was sweet and not too tangy.  To go along with my wrap, I decided on a their house lemonade. It's pretty sweet, but probably because it's made with real lemons, which of course, are extremely sweet.   I will definitely be back again, and this time, I'll be sitting out on the covered patio because it's DARLING. Hope I make it out for a road trip to Summerlin soon because I'll be dreaming about this place until then.",

The look of the entire place Super cute and trendy - the green look that's in right now. The staff at this location where really the best - so nice and so helpful and I get annoying asking tons on questions about everything on the menu, so always a nice when they go alone and help.   We got the kombucha on tap- really good!   We liked it a lot and would come back",

The forbidden rice was perfect cuz the hoisin sauce just enough not too much not too little and the little extra greens from Broccoli and snap peas crunchy good enough for me to eat almost all the rice all at once and I don't usually like rice alone have to have tons of protein !",

The decor is very 'flower-power-modernized', The freshness of the veggies are great and the colorful spread of my Glow Bowl lived up to its expectations in my mouth. I came from a fresh-detox of no chewing, so going back to chewing--I did lot of it, crunch and munchin on the glow-bowl. The taste was fabulous. The spice was great, I added Sriracha to it to add more of a kick but I loved it anyway. I paired it with their house-Rose and I had the perfect afternoon and date with myself!

    "text": "Running errands on the West Side had me going crazy all day in excitement wanting to try this adorable dining spot. After months and months of dying to come here, I finally decided today was the day!   After asking the cashier the best options, we settled on the \"Build your own plates!\"   Plate 1: Chicken with Brussels Sprouts, Sweet Potatoes, and the Mac n' Cheese!  Plate 2: Chicken with Eggplant and Brussels Sprouts!   Before I get into how all the food tasted, I want to say that the atmosphere is completely adorable! The staff is filled with good vibes to match! I just wish the food matched my emotions on the decor.   Unfortunately, when we received our food it was lukewarm! This may have started the bad taste in our mouth about the meal.   The Chicken tasted like Tyson Frozen Grilled Chicken Breast Strips and was extremely watery. The Brussel Sprouts tasted like the oil they may have been cooked in. The Mac n' Cheese tasted like a box of White Cheddar Cheez-It's! The Eggplant and Sweet Potatoes were the best on the plate and even those were only half-way decent.   To sum up the meal, it wasn't anything special. The meal tasted like it was from a microwavable box from Whole Foods. Therefore, I could make the meals for half the price and the same taste in my own kitchen! Which 100% saddens me to say because I really wanted this to be a new \"must have\" spot on my list.   I would love to give this place another chance, however, I don't see that happening in the near future.",

I understand there are different chefs working each day, but  it's not rocket science to taste your food multiple times throughout the day.

Their deal was 2 for $40 dinner. So took my sons to give it a shot.  Their menu was 3 courses and drink. Soup - they tried the Thai chicken, entree - grass fed steak with smashed potatoes, gluten free Mac and cheese and sauteed broccoli. Dessert was a chocolate chip cookie.  The drink choices was one of their in house made lemonade or a local beer.  The entrees that the boys had were good. They enjoyed the steak and mashed.  Mac and cheese not as much. I had the wrap which was on their menu for restaurant week but I bought separately as we had 3 people in our party. The wrap was good, the tortilla was a slightly different texture and was filled with lettuce avocado hummus tomatoes and a small amount of turkey. Could have been more turkey.   The side was a spring mix salad that was lightly dressed.   Overall the flavor of the food was good.  A one off for me. Would be enjoyed by those looking for gluten free, vegan healthy overall options.",

The use of super food ingredients in most or all the menu. The interior design feels spring in the air.   I ended up ordering the forbidden rice bowl add beef. It was very healthy, light, refreshing, and colorful. The different carbs not only added lot of flavor, texture, and color. Really great idea! Add beef gave it more volume and hearty. The beef had great flavor! I could have got bowl of beef over rice traditional style be happy. Portion size was decent.  Overall would recommend Flower Child looking to eat healthy.

The rose petal lemonade was just okay, I could taste more of the rose petal than the lemonade.  Place cute inside, although very noisy. Eat outside or in other room if you do not like it noisy.  A little pricey about $35.",

Had the Med Quinoa salad with perfectly cooked, moist salmon ~ maybe a bit over-dressed but that's 100% on me for forgetting to ask for it on the side as I usually do. With a glass of Rose and a lemon cupcake the lunch felt guilt-free and decadent at the same time. Decor and service? Fabulous too.",

The food... ok so we had: Avacado toast- I feel that toast society is much better and I was honestly surprised how small of a slice of toast it was for the $7-$8  Spicy Japanese Eggplant- if you like eggplant then this was very tasty and enjoyable. Maybe because I had all these different foods it seemed a tad over powering as far as flavor.   Red chili glazed sweet potato- hands down the best item, I would order that alone it was so good.   Mother Earth Bowl with Chicken- I mean it was a salad and it was good... I was surprised how well the broccoli pesto and miso vinaigrette tasted together as I would never put those flavors together.   Overall Flower Child was okay... I personally wouldn't drive from Henderson to Summerlin again to have it, but my best friend loves it so I'm sure I'll be back. And I'm more of a soda fountain consumer so the kombucha on tap threw me off as I was really looking for a nice cold Diet Coke.",

I was so excited that we were offered the chance to join them in Soft Opening / Training Day for Flower Child! I was already anticipating amazing food just by their IG! But when we checked in and saw the menu I couldn't just order one thing!   It was my co-workers and I, who were able to check out the new spot. We ordered the Avocado Hummus, Crushed Avocado Toast and Vietnamese Crunch Salad to share at the table. We loved the toast and hummus! Those were two items that we would come back for time and time again! The toast had the perfect amount of avocado and the sliced egg was in every bite! Yummy!!! The hummus came with thin pita slices, but that avocado hummus was well made and it was so smooth and delicious!!   As far as our meals, we had 2 3-side plates and a Rebel wrap. The portion size is excellent! It's enough to get you full and satisfied but not overly stuffed! I had the green beans, sweet potatoes, and eggplant with steak. The best side I had was the eggplant! I loved the sauce it was served with plus the cashews were an amazing addition to it!! The steak was well prepared and it was the perfect amount for all the sides!  The staff was friendly and super helpful with the ordering process and they always made sure our plates were cleared and we had everything we needed as we enjoyed our meal.   I'm intrigued to try the rest of the menu and their different flavored lemonades! Though it's a little far for me, I'd definitely come back! It's a beautiful location and the layout is super cute!",

They also have an outdoor shaded sitting area if you're wanting a little more fresh air which is just as nicely decorated as the inside.   The service is impeccable and I received my food in a timely manner. I had the Mother Earth bowl which had ancient grains, sweet potato, portobello mushroom, avocado, cucumber, broccoli pesto, charred onions, leafy greens, red pepper miso vinaigrette, and hemp seed. It was the perfect blend of flavor and was very fulfilling. They give you the option to add protein but it was just fine as is. I also ordered their seasonal lemonade. They hand you a cup and you have the option to choose from the 3 different flavors they have displayed. I went for the cucumber mint lemonade which was so refreshing and you can really taste the cucumber. Refills are allowed so I definitely went back for more before I stepped back out into the Vegas heat that day. I look forward to trying more of their other food options.   I was quite impressed by how fulfilling their food was. Considering most vegetarian/vegan or any kind of healthy food spot leaves me hungry after 5 minutes, I actually didn't have to eat dinner after this place. If you do go, I recommend getting the Mother Earth bowl. It didn't seem like much but it was actually the perfect serving. Enjoy!",

Friendly service folks. Nice avocado toast appetizer (a bit on the small side). We enjoyed our salads and plates. The only catch was it's not cheap. $18 per person without any drinks or tip. I would hesitate to come back - \"it's good but do I want to spend that much?\" Maybe or maybe not. Ps It was packed for lunch on Sunday.",

    "text": "OK, THIS VENUE IS LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR!  I LOVE everything about this place!  The ambiance, decor, service and especially the food!!   The large open dining area is casual yet very chic, comfy and very inviting.   You walk in and there are two areas to order. One cashier (far left) is for carry-out, and the other two cashiers (right) are for dine in orders. They were quite busy, and I appreciated how patient the cashier was with me as I tried to decide what to order from their extensive menu. I'm not a fan of raw kale, but my girlfriend highly recommended it so we ordered the kale salad and avocado toast, which I love. You pay for your meal and they give you a number for your order to place on your table.   Even before the food arrived, I enjoyed just sitting there and soaking in the upbeat, vibrant atmosphere! I tried a bite of the kale salad and instantly regretted that I did not order it for myself! The fibrous, chewy spine of the kale was removed and the leafy green was finely chopped and I loved it, raw, to my surprise! The citrusy light dressing, mild cheeses and seeds made it an amazing flavorful and textural combination, and a culinary delight for my palate! I'm craving it now as I write about it now.  If you are in the area, definitely check it out. However, it is worth checking out regardless which side of town you are coming from!",

The food was great- health choices, taste good, only thing is a little bit expensive for what you get.  Service is great.  Clean and sleek place.  Tried the pick 3 with grass fed steak- got the sauteed spinach, sauteed eggplant-yum-, and green beans.  No soda but have local beers. Definitely coming back to try other meals in the menu.",

I didn't get to experience the dining yet. I will definitely come back to try. The place itself is very cute. I instantly felt joyful when stepping foot inside. The restaurant is very spacious and the decor is a mix of floral (hence the name of place) and greenery arrangements. I ordered the Strawberry Fields salad which was the perfect combination of yumminess and very light yet I was still full after eating it. I knocked off a star only because when I arrived i didn't know the drill since I was picking up. People were kind of standing around but no direction given as to where to pick up our food?! I just happened to glance over and saw my salad sitting on the side on a shelf. Other than that I truly enjoyed my salad and the place itself is just too cute! I can't wait to come back with friends to dine in.",

You order at the counter and choose a table-many seating options both inside and outside. The decor is reminiscent of a farmhouse-albeit modernized. Food came fairly quickly. My daughter had the forbidden rice with chicken. She describes the chicken as being cooked to perfection. Her veggies were very fresh and the flavor was impeccable. The Mac and cheese was quite tasty - made with a sharp mixture-a good tone of Parmesan. The vegan poke bowl was filled with fresh, well marinated veggies. Kombucha on tap - delish. We finished off with a gluten-free brownie which was good yet crumbly. It needs more moisture and less time in the oven. Very chocolatey. We will certainly be back!! Can't wait to try more dishes off the menu.",

The Free Spirit chicken wrap ($12) was very good BUT had a lot of whole almonds which were all too hard, after biting into a couple of them, I had to pull and throw them all away before I break a tooth.  Very expensive but I wanted to try Flower Child for several months now.  Big disappointment.",

I believe that the turkey used is a processed turkey similar to the packaged turkey I could buy in Walmart, if I chose to buy such low-grade turkey.  My friend had a tofu wrap.  She said that the mixture of flavors wasn't well thought out.  She finished her wrap reluctantly.  The lemonade was good, but I won't be returning.

Their main categories consists of salads, plates, bowls and wraps. I ended up going with a plate that consisted of three options. The three options I picked were Indian spiced cauliflower, red chili glazed sweet potatoes and spicy jalapeno eggplant, I topped it off with tofu as my protein. To sum it all up WOW! All of the choices for my plate where amazing 5/5 stars. My sister had bird is the word and she added avocado hummus. She didn't enjoy the grilled onions in side but loved the side salad 3/5 stars. We also had a fresh brewed beverage. I tried all of them and alone non of them were really that enjoyable. However, if you make an Arnold Palmer it's ok. Finally, customer service was amazing very friendly and helpful staff.",

The menu caters to all facets of your dietary needs/wants.  There is optional protein choices (steak, salmon, and chicken) to add to any dish you choose.  The choices for Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten Free dishes was extensive and not boring as you may find in typical Vegan or Vegetarian restaurants.  I had the Mother Earth bowl with added chicken.  Not only was the dish aesthetically pleasing, it was an explosion of flavor that my taste buds couldn't get enough of!  I felt like I couldn't get the food in my mouth fast enough.  The atmosphere was vibrant and fun, decor was perfectly quaint, and the staff was absolutely wonderful.  A definite must if you have been on the fence about going.",

    "text": "My review is titled \"Faux Avocado\".    Here is the rub.  My wife and I both love fresh avocado.  This restaurant is new in the Summerlin area and we were excited to give it a try.  When I saw \"Smoked Turkey Wrap with Avocado\" and she saw \"Avocado Toast\" on the menu we were sold.  Here is the sad part...Don't advertise \"avocado\" unless you are going to use real fresh avocado.  We were very disappointed.  What they served me on the wrap and her on the toast reminded us of the frozen stuff that came in a plastic dish in the market.  It was watery, tasteless, and resembled very little of fresh avocado.  They concocted some form of mixture that just didn't work.  I am giving this place two stars (not one) because I love the concept of healthy fresh food and atmosphere.  When they decide to serve real avocado instead of faux avocado I will certainly come back.  In the meanwhile I really want to give them a second chance but will stay away from the smoked turkey wrap with \"faux\" avocado and \"faux\" avocado toast.",

It was pretty busy inside, but I was in and out in less than 10 minutes for my to-go order. The staff was so friendly and upbeat, making it such a great atmosphere - a positive little break in the day. The Vegan Poke was so perfect. It's got a lot of beets, which I've never been fond of, but this might put beets back on the menu for me! I added tofu, which had the flakey consistency, acting as a convincing pass for salmon. The Rose Petal Lemonade was refreshing, but not quite enough Rose - just seemed like regular lemonade. Add more Rose, Flower Child, please!!  So thankful this gem is so close to work",

    "text": "New. Favorite. Restaurant.  Discovered Flower Child just a day before they opened, in passing. Then, miraculously *cough* an ad popped up on my Facebook letting me know that it was to open the next day! Excited, I took my sister and her boyfriend with me on opening day and we all loved it SO much that I brought my boyfriend with me the very next day!  The atmosphere is wonderful. Very Instagram-y and it really has this cute California vibe. When you walk in, you will find a to-go ordering counter and a dine-in ordering counter. Dining in, you'll place an order, they'll give you a number stand and you find your own table where they'll bring your food out to you.  The menu is medium-ish sized, but the number of combinations you can make with all of the items are endless. In the two times I've gone, I ordered the Avocado Toast (10/5!!! AMAZING) and the Mother Earth bowl (5/5). I can't tell you just how much I loved both. I added two proteins to my bowl: the Tofu (5/5) and the Salmon (5/5). The Avocado Toast is the best I've ever had (and I am a HUGE avocado toast fan) and all of the ingredients of the bowl are PHE-NOM-ENAL! The Tofu is a super firm, seasoned tofu. It's delicious and unlike any store-bought tofu I've ever tried. The Salmon was cooked perfectly with even a little crispiness around the edges.  The Avocado Toast was and will likely always be my all-time favorite. The avocado is roughly mashed, still chunky. They top it with crunchy sea salts (yum!), black sesame seeds, white cheddar (I mean, WOW) and chunks of soft-boiled eggs (droooooool). The coolest part is that they cut the toast into 3 slices for easy eating! NO mess and NO falling ingredients!  Opening days for restaurants can sometimes be pretty obviously hectic, stressful and a bit of a chaotic mess (even for the patrons). However, despite the line of customers out the door, service was quick, friendly, polite and extremely seamless! I was very impressed and I couldn't wait to come back the next day with my boyfriend to share in the amazingness that is Flower Child. (FYI: he LOVED it. And he didn't think he was going to!) I will be back. Again and again and again and again...",

I didn't complain or anything about it taking a long time.

I decided to try it today after a hard workout at the gym since I felt like I should eat something \"healthy\". I got the mashed potatoes, spicy eggplant and salmon plate to go. Wow. It was so delicious. I have been missing out on this all this time! Now, how healthy is this? I'm not sure. I wish there's calories listed on the menu. It's healthy probably because the portion size is SMALL. The $7 salmon is about the size of the palm of my hand. I feel hungry after my meal, and that's already after letting the food \"sit\" for awhile. And I'm not even a big eater (I usually cannot finish my meal in one sitting). I will definitely come back again, but might have to add on more items, although I'm not sure about paying $20+ for simple mashed potatoes and salmon in a casual fast food type of a restaurant. Ok, I'm seriously still hungry. I need to go look for more food now.",

My steak wrap was filling and the sweet potato side hit the spot. Good place for vegans and meat eaters alike. Easy going ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating.  I don't think they have an official military discount, but when I asked they gave me one anyways. I was impressed by their customer service. Staff was friendly and helpful.  I will be returning here for sure.",

And Flower Child far exceeded any expectations we had. It's definitely a laidback environment from my perspective.   As for the food, we all ordered different items. But I ordered a plate with 3 sides and a protein (salmon). My sides were sweet potatoes, mixed fruit, and spinach. I don't know what mojo they put on the spinach, but I'm definitely craving more. It makes eating healthy fun and easy, can't wait to come back!!",

This takes to the backseat of the food.  The food portion is average, who said health food has to be average portioned?  Engorge me on health food, please.  Make me fat!    I ordered the grass fed beef wrap, a bit on the salty and saucy side, I really wished I got a bit more food.  Tasted good, like a yogurt braised roast beef kind of meat sauce.  While I liked everything, it's just not something I would feel a serious craving for.",

    "text": "Coming from an actual flower child, I absolutely love this place!!  I visit Flower Child at least once or twice a month. I have tried almost every item on the menu and love the quality of their products. The items that always keep me coming back is their Bird Is The Word wrap & their Organic Kale salad. I've had my fair share of salads, but there's just something about their cheese, almonds, and kale that makes it really unique. I also love how they shred/chop the kale so I'm not eating a whole leaf.  It isn't often that I see an establishment that has kombucha on tap and that's something I love about Flower Child, too. I would also recommend trying their lemon cupcakes. They're just the perfect amount of sweet and lemon that you need! In regards to their vegan options, you can modify items in the menu to substitute or even take out. So that gives me a peace of mind if I'm ever wanting to try something \"vegan style\".  The ambiance of the restaurant is fun and playful. Every decoration in this place definitely shows that someone really put the time and effort to make everything come together.   The service is fast, efficient, and friendly. I feel like I'm at a friend's house when I visit here! It can get really busy during lunch time but the staff there still remains chill.   My only concern would be the slight confusion of getting served. The first few times I came into Flower Child, I didn't realize the drinks were self-serviced, along with the utensils and sauces. The only thing really being delivered to you is the food! The way I compare this store is to Skinny Fats. You get a table number, you sit anywhere that's available and you get your own drinks and what not!",

As the name suggests, it's a healthier, fairly pretentious(they have a \"yoga mat parking spot\" possibly for those coming from TruFusion) joint in Summerlin falling smack dab in the middle of two of some of my favorite other restaurants North Italia and Honey Salt. Its menu boasts fancy salads, wraps, grain bowls, and vegan or gluten-free versions of popular dishes, along with a plethora of simple sides. What I absolutely love about this place is that all the food possesses wonderful flavor and quality, which isn't compromised by how healthy it is so you feel really good walking out of there, and it's very reasonably priced (a full tummy for around $10). My favorites include: the yuzu brussel sprouts, the butternut squash, and the mac and cheese, however I've tried so much of the menu and I've really never been disappointed! It has a cute, casual, and bright/refreshing atmosphere inside and to sum up how I really feel about this place...if I had to give up all the unhealthy food I indulge in for a healthier diet, I would gladly do so if all healthy food tasted like how it does here.",

Everyone sampled each others dishes and the verdict was the same....\"Oh my gosh this is SO good!\"  We all ended up adding salmon to our bowls or plates, and it was fresh, flavorful and delicious.  Plenty to the serving size...two of us took home leftovers, two pigged out and ate it all.    Very casual atmosphere, and also a covered \"open air\" dining space.  The staff was friendly.  The price was reasonable for the exceptional quality of food.  We went on a Wednesday evening and there was no trouble getting a seat for our group.  I noticed a few posts made comments about the service, which is kind of an oxymoron to me as you order at the counter, get a number and pick your own table, self-serve drinks if you aren't purchasing alcohol or a bottled drink, and then the food is delivered to your table.  Not much customer service involved in my mind but...  If you're open to new tastes and like to try different foods - don't hesitate to check this place out.",

This restaurant is fast casual, so be prepared to wait in a short line to look at the menu and order before sitting.  The menu consists of a few salads, bowls, drinks, and sides. Lots of typical, trendy, \"millenial\" buzz word foods like avocado toast, quinoa, and hummus. Most items are vegetarian/vegan and then you have the option of adding a protein like salmon, grass fed beef, or tofu. I liked that the menu clearly labeled foods that were vegan and vegetarian and had the option of adding meat. I got the Vietnamese Salad, which ended up being a bit underwelming. The bulk of the salad was crunchy white cabbage strings that just arent satisfying the way greens would have been. I liked the avocado and pineapple in the salad though!   As we were eating, I started to notice details. Every table had a bottle and a little plant (we had thistle flowers), the restaurant's token hashtag was prominelty displayed, and every corner felt \"instagramable.\" The more I looked, the more I realized this place is like a character of what they think 20-somethings want. I think they ended up trying too hard to please millennials and it just started to feel forced.  The food was decent, atmosphere is decent, it just felt too cliche for me and so we probably wont be back. Unless I need a cute avocado toast shot on my instagram.",

    "text": "Cheers and more power to restaurants that offer healthy options that actually taste good!   When I try a place during their grand opening, I set low expectations and bump my patience level all the way up - I expect things to not go perfectly since they're working on kinks and all that. But Flower Child managed to pleasantly surprise me. They got their act together and things are going smoothly like a well-oiled machine. Service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious. The place was packed but no errors/ chaos occurred.  They have daily soup, salads, plates, bowls, wraps which you can add your favorite protein (chicken, salmon, grass-fed steak, or tofu) to. They have sweet treats as well. To drink, they have seasonal lemonade, iced tea, kombucha (on tap), wine, and beer.  Thai Cashew Quinoa with Salmon Bowl: My bowl came out smoking hot - I got a good facial. Very tasty Asian flavors with a bit of a kick from the jalapeno. Lots of textures and flavors. The salmon was nowhere dry or over cooked at all - it was perfection! 5/5  Spicy Japanese Eggplant, Sauteed Spinach + Grass-fed Steak Plate: With their plates, you can pick 1, 2 or 3 veg/ grains and add a protein. The steak is lean but tender and flavorful. The veggies were delightful with a bit of heat and refreshing tang. 5/5  Brownie: Gluten-free...I don't have celiac disease so, I'm not afraid/ avoidant of gluten. But if you do have celiac disease, this is the sweet treat for you! Good texture and very mo!$t. 5/5  Lemon Olive Oil Cupcake: Not only did we try 1 cupcake, we had to get a dozen! I've had lemon Olive oil cupcakes before that only have a hint of lemon and olive oil + regular oil - not good. These cupcakes were so good. Strong flavors. Sweet and savory at the same time. 5/5  Chocolate Chip Cookie: Another gluten-free item. Made with cashews, coconut and other ingredients without tasting too coconutty. Crunchy. 4/5  One of the highlights for me is their drink station. They have different kinds of teas and lemonades. They're all good and you can get creative by mixing different flavors.  They have neat wall murals, flowers, and little details such as a \"yoga mat parking\". So, after a good sweat sesh, this is a good spot to eat at with your gym squad.",

The service is very friendly and you cannot go wrong with this place. You order at the counter and then you go sit down with a number at your table and the food is brought to you. You are not rushed and this place is great for families, including little kids whose parents are encouraging healthy eating, and great for friends and even couples. The prices are a little high but worth every penny. This is not a cheap place yet it is not exorbitantly high either. Highly recommended!",

I just think for the price there's a lot of other places and things I'd rather eat. My daughters wanted to try it so we went.   One daughter had the skinny cob and loved it. My other daughter has the strawberry fields salad and liked it but the said she preferred cafe Zuppas salad...and my other daughter and I thought she was nuts. This was way more flavorful and who wants to repeat their order 50 times..this is better...order take a number--take it to the table and they Bring it there.   I would eat there again.

I shared the Bird Is The Word and gluten free mac and cheese when I brought my mother and while the mac and cheese was pretty good, the wrap was basic. Something I didn't expect was to feel very sluggish after eating since usually healthy foods make you feel better but perhaps that was just my experience. Furthermore, for the price of the food I was expecting more from my service than having to get my own forks, knives, napkins, and drinks. I suppose that's the theme of the restaurant but as much as the restaurant LOOKED like a luxury, the service was quick and impersonal. Not a total deal breaker, but you generally expect more from a restaurant in this area, especially given the other great spots just feet away.   Overall it feels like you're paying more for the kitsch of a cute healthy place with vegan options rather than an actual restaurant or even high end cafe. Good place but probably wouldn't go again, especially for such a hefty price tag (25$ for a wrap, drink, and side of mac and cheese).",

It is visually appealing and very cute and well decorated, they offer a great variety of world flavors & colorful dishes ranging in salads, soups, clean protein options, the price point is very reasonable, the establishment is clean, as the employees are well groomed, young & kind.     I do feel indifferent about the quality of the food.  I can taste the emulsifiers used in many of their dressings, sauces, marinades.   As cute looking as this restaurant is i highly suspect they use a lot of preservatives, this place is a chain restaurant, deff not a scratch kitchen, I like my food to be cooked by people, not mix in ingredients in bowls with pre doctored sauces made for mass production.    For that, I could just stay at home & toss a Wal-Mart vegetable quality chopped salad w/ a pre made mix, which i never do.   I left today with a stomach ache but that's only because of sensitivety to gmos, sugars, guar gums & processed junk.     I probably won't come back here because I love organic, farm fresh food, i love real traceability in the food I eat.   I don't feel I get that from Flower Child.  This place is created to run like a well oiled machine, too corporate for me, i prefer to dine at mom & pops / sole proprieter restaurants that put True soul in their food. I wish Flower Child the best in it's endeavours, it's just not for me.",

It really offers something for everyone from desserts to build-your-own plates to vegan offerings, to different types of cuisines. But you're f-ing up if you don't order the Thai eggplant and their kale salad with grapefruit and white cheddar at least once. Seriously. I tell people it is my favey fave salad in the city.  Get a drink and mix the teas together. Also their tofu is bitchin. Whatever witchcraft they are doing back there to make it so tasteyyyyy is working.",

I don't even know how else to describe it:  The crunchy corn, fresh arugula, nuts, cucumbers...and gorgonzola dressing...all the flavors mix incredibly well! And it's healthy! Add some salmon/ chicken/ tofu/ steak to up the protein factor and it's a full on meal.   I've also had their Mother Earth Bowl, which is super yummy too! Veg friendly and packed with garlicky goodness. The broccoli pesto is awesome. It's earthy in all the good ways.   My only complaint is that the portion sizes are quite small, so without the additional protein, the salads and bowls are not a filling meal.   Decor is super fun and fresh.

I get that their food is fresh and organic and all that but for that price we didn't feel like it was a satisfying meal. Most of the items tasted pretty good but portion was on the smaller side, even if you get a protein and three sides you might not be full. I like the concept, you can choose a protein and some sides to make a dinner plate but it just didn't do it for me.",

The last few visits I've been dissatisfied. I ordered the Thai Cashew Quinoa and there weren't any cashews in the entree. Today I ordered my regular Kale Salad and it didn't come with the black currants or the smoked almonds.  It makes a big difference when key ingredients are left out of a entree. It's especially noticeable in something as basic as a salad. There should be communication between the kitchen and front of house so that they are able to inform customers of missing ingredients so they know what to expect, or at least have the opportunity to order something else. Just sharing constructive criticism in hopes of improving the experience.",

    "text": "Decided to try something new with a couple gf's & my mini me -- Flower Child was definitely a good choice. The decor is super cute & the place is very spacious. Of course, I went with the most basic and ordered the avocado toast & a Prosecco + Lemonade. My daughter had the kids meal -- she picked chicken, mashed potatoes & the fruits (strawberries, apples & clementines) and she had a Mango Pineapple Lemonade. When the food came out, I was a little shocked at the portions. I mean yes, I only got an avocado toast, but it was just so dainty. Anyway, my avo toast was very 'toasty' (overly crunchy), but the amount of avo & egg made up for the 'toasty-ness'. The Prosecco + splash of lemonade was spot on. On to my daughters meal -- she said her chicken was dry, but there was yummy flavor to it. She loved the fruits because they tasted fresh and sweet. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves & will be going back to try other things.",

I've had the vegan poke (many times) and the build your own plate with the glazed sweet potato and cauliflower. All amazing and 10/10. I wish they would work on flavoring their tofu a bit more. But many places don't so I won't knock a star down for that. Just a thought! Really busy during lunch and very instagram worthy for us millennials. I hope they bring a location to Henderson so I can stop driving so far for this place!   Also forgot to take a photo of my food. *fails at being a millennial*",

Unfortunately, the quality of food was good but it didn't meet our expectations. Maybe it was hyped up too much, but we genuinely wanted to enjoy flower child. When we arrived the place was packed. We decided to order the side of eggplant, broccoli, asparagus, and the avocado toast because we weren't too hungry. The sides were very small and they were $4 a piece which was a little pricey. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so over priced. The avocado toast was pretty good other than the fact that the piece of toast that it was on was a little burnt but the toppings had a good flavor. The restaurant has a trendy feel and overall is beautiful. The service was outstanding as well but I wish we enjoyed the food a little more especially for the price.",

    "text": "The most two recent times I have visited Flower Child on rampart in Las Vegas Nevada I was extremely disappointed as they had run out of essential ingredients that are in many of their dishes. The first instance they had run out of avocado and asked me what they might replace the item with. I ask for bok choy as a replacement for the avocado. After picking up the order and returning home I realized there was no bok choy in the dish I had ordered. The most recent instance they were out of tofu. This time I decided to let a manager know that this was not the first time they had run out of seemingly essential ingredients. I spoke with the manager and she's recommended that I replace the tofu with another item that they had available. She offered to comp my meal to which I told her that was not necessary I just wanted to let her know that this was the second time in a row they did not have ingredients offered on the menu. She insisted to comp the meal and we agreed to replace the tofu with sauteed spinach. After driving home and unpacking the meal I realized that the sauteed spinach never found its way into the bag.  I called back to the same manager and she apologized that it was a mixup. Flower child does have pretty good food when they actually have the ingredients, however that seems to be very rare lately. Furthermore the forgetfulness of the staff and management is unbelievable.  They receive a 9 out of 10 on quality of food and a 3 out of 10 on customer service and information retention.",

    "text": "Just a fantastic healthy meal.  It's only been open a few weeks and already the lines are out the door for both sit down and takeout on a normal Monday afternoon.  I ordered a forbidden rice salad with added tofu.  Large and full of different vegetables which made it nothing basic.  I saw broccoli and green beans and many other colorful fillings with additional jalapeno to spice it up.  Though it wasn't spicy whatsoever, it was still a nice dish to get the afternoon rolling.  The tofu was grilled nicely and tasted fresh.  Some of the better looking tofu I've had and presented well even at takeout where it was sliced thin and layed on top of the forbidden rice.Inside is pretty, kind of a sleek brunchy vibe.  Plenty of parking available and service was very fast with a takeout order called and picked up in less than 15 minutes, even during the rush of lunch.  Very impressed by Flower Child and will be back.  More of a higher end price-wise, at $14 for my salad with additional tofu, but well worth it for quality and taste.",

It tasted like crap and it looked rushed. when I complained the employee told me sorry the trainers left that's probably when you enjoyed your food. I told them they can keep my money they probably needed it more than I do and left pissed!!!!",
