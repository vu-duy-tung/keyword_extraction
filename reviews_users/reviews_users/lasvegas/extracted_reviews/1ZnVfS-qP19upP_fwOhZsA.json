I would be eating here regularly if I lived close by.   Really enjoyed the salt and pepper fish, ramen, and chicken curry.  All the dishes were nuanced and thoughtfully prepared. The chicken curry was entirely different from an other curry I've had.  Normally, I tend to ask for spicy \"punch me in the face\" flavors and look forward to them when going out to eat asian food.  Here, there was great nuanced flavor and spice without a bite. This is a new experience for me. Great food.",

When I made my order in chinese which I thought is appropriate since it is a chinese restaurant afterall.  The waiter just being so rude and said, \"What did you say?\"  Then when he bought out the food, and i asked for egg noodle and he thought i said no noodle.  When I told him, he bought in another bowl with egg noodle, and poured the original bowl of noodle soup into the other bowl and splashed the soup all over the table.  Talking about he food, they were awful.  The congee is like glue and has no flavor.  The noodle soup is just average.  I wouldn't come here ever ever again.",

If you happen to catch this review soon enough, you can drop in and get a free entree with the purchase of a $1 soda or bottled water. It's for dine-in only and is valid through May 18.  I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice. This dish normally costs $4.95 but was free with my $1 can of ginger ale. So how was it? It was actually very good. For $4.95, it's a great deal. For free, it's a steal!  Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.  I'm inclined to give this place four stars based on the one dish I've tried so far, and the extremely fast and friendly service. Add in the fact that everything is under $5 - oh and that's tax included - and I'm glad to bump that up to a fiver.",

    "text": "I went to Big Wong Restaurant for a Meetup (Sushi & More) gathering, met some diverse and interesting folks and we for the most part enjoyed the meal we had during their opening $1 promotion.  My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.  The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.  Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more \"seasoned\".  I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.  The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.  The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the \"greasy\" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.  Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.  And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.  ------Version 1.0.1 Update------ Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).  I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.  The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant. 5-29-2011 ------Version 1.0.1 Update------  Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.  ------Version 1.0.2 Update------ Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self.  12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P) ------Version 1.0.2 Update------  Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.  Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!  Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.  Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant.",

I would honestly pick a run of the mill Americanized Chinese restaurant over this place. So what went wrong?  We ordered fried shrimp wontons, stewed beef in oyster sauce, pork ribs in black beans sauce and the salt and pepper chicken wings. The wontons were greasy, the beef stew had too much cornstarch so the sauce was like jello, the ribs weren't cooked long enough and had no flavor, and the chicken wings weren't seasoned. Am I being hyper-critical? I don't think so, my white husband also thought the food was below average.   Then there's the service. I know many Chinese restaurants don't win over customers with friendly service but this guy really takes the cake. He doesn't greet you, just points to a table and tells you to go sit. I heard him speak Chinese speak with his kitchen staff but when customers speak to him in Chinese he pretends he doesn't understand. Then an old man comes in and asks to sit in a corner, but he forces the customer to sit at a table by the kitchen and shakes his head like the customer was a pest. Why open a restaurant if you can't be bothered to treat your customers with basic decency?",

The lady server we had gotten didn't seem friendly. If anything, she seemed annoyed when she took our order. There was 10 of us so maybe that was overwhelming, but it just looked like we were troubling her by our order or something.   The styrofoam cups should have gave me a clue. Besides their plates and bowls, everything else we had gotten was plastic. I had ordered their hoi nam chicken rice with white breast meat and oh man, it was... super dry. The sauce they gave me for it didn't even help hide the dryness of it. Ugh. I washed down the rest of the chicken while promising myself that I will never get this again. The rice it came with was good, but it didn't save the chicken.   At least the bathroom was clean.   1 star for being opened on thanksgiving when everything else was closed.  1 star for not charging for tea.",

Got a great flavor and it's made to order.   We also got some stir fried bok choy that was really tasty and 2 of their congee.    I love the preserved egg congee and pork.  Their fish congee was just ok, the fish smelled and tasted slightly fishy....  The congee is the thick style and it's like $4 for a big bowl.    In the midst of all the pricy places to eat in Vegas, this place is a nice break on your pocketbook if you want something simple and tasty.",

Items ordered:  Beef Ramen - Don't expect Japanese Raman or anything near that.  The broth in this soup taste like beef stew and its yummy.  Very tasty and yummy.  Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - Nom Nom Nom.... I love the chicken wings here.  Fried to perfection and the wings were season to perfection too.  Shrimp Won-Ton Soup with Udon - This noodle soup was a little bland, but that is how these kind of noodle soup is supposed to be.    Will recommend this place to anyone who want some authentic Chinese food.",

    "text": "Keep it simple.  That's what Big Wong is about!  Concentrate on doing a few dishes right and that's what I like.  =)  Overall their menu is only about 20ish items but really they are only various combinations of a base of 10 dishes?  - Hoi Nam Chicken - Basic braised chicken dish that is simple to make but not everyone can make tasty.  They got it right here.  The rice had a nice essence of chicken, the chicken was slightly salted and when paired with the sweet and tangy sauce of the side, it was quite scrumptious. - Beef Stew - Oh comfort food.  This is it!  It had a slightly spicy kick with the sauce.  Even in warm weather, this was comforting. - Veggies and Oyster Sauce - This dish was a little sub par.  Veggies were chopped to 2\" chunks which left the fun out of eating our greens! - Bonus:  Fried Shrimp Wonton - They served us these fresh out of the fryer!  Great shrimp flavor and happy surprise.  Conclusion:  Big Wong is a great place for simple dishes with good taste. 3.5 stars",

It's cheap, it's good, it's fast, it's served piping hot & it hasn't made me sick the 3 times I've tried it.  Easily my favorite wonton soup in the valley.  The added greens are a nice touch.  All the other times I've had wonton soup, it was just the wontons.  Granted, I need to try other things on their menu, but I always fill up on the wonton & am satisfied.  Don't expect anything fancy when you arrive.  I simply come here for a quick & delicious bowl of soup...not the decor.    If you don't feel like waiting to be seated at Monta...give this place (in the same strip mall/parking lot) a shot.",

From the food to the wait staff to the cheapness TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NO SHAME IN THEIR GAME AND THE KITCHEN DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THE PLACE.   I just enjoy it.  One broke Sunday I decide it's worth the drive to explore China town and end up taking the BF into BW.  First of all, he loved his food. He had the Hoi Nam chicken. When the waitress brought it out she took one look at his giant-ginger self and explained to him how to eat it. Which he highly appreciated.  I got the chicken curry and man they do it well. The flavor is deep and the meat is so tender it becomes a gravy for me to slather atop rice.  We also split the shrimp appetizer can't fail there.  When the bill came to 15 bucks I thought he was gonna faint. Good times.",

I haven't tried a lot of their other items because I only come here for the curry, but their vegetables are also very tasty. I recommend ordering the Bok Choy with your curry.  Their curry has the perfect amount of spice for me and a good ratio of meat/potatoes/rice. I usually get the beef curry or chicken curry w/ roti pancakes (only 4.95)  Now I have read that people don't really get the best service here, which is True. Personally, I just come here to quickly satisfy my curry craving and the food comes out so fast that I don't even care about extra service. This place is definitely worth the price and even if you don't like it, your wallet won't be crying.",

Pictures and menu posted on their window looked good.  Yelped it and it had four stars but some Yelpers were complaining about service.  We were their first customers and the waiter greeted us politely.  I ordered the fish ball with rice noodles, broth was delicious!  Clean and sweet!! Hubs got beef ramen (generous portions of beef) and we shared Hainan chicken over rice and Chinese broccoli.  I originally wanted on choy but the waiter shook his head, and recommended  the Chinese broccoli.  I appreciated his honesty.  Veggie came out tender. Hubs wanted fish congee but it wasn't ready until an hour later.  Good thing they didn't have it ready otherwise we would be taking it to go.  Met Big Wong, he was raving about their ginger sauce for the Hainan chicken with a customer over the phone.  We didn't get any with our order so I asked for some.  He was very nice and brought us a dish of fresh ginger sauce.    Good food and you can't beat the price.  Didn't expect any service but we received excellent service!  Will have to come back for the fish congee and chicken wings (Big Wing recommended).",

Not the most flavorful, kinda bland actually.  I think I can make a better curry than this (and it's made from curry cubes ala box!).  * Shrimp fried wontons- The hubs and I don't normally order wontons but the waitress recommended so we gave it a try.  Mostly fried wrapper with a little ground up shrimp inside.  We ate the tasty shrimp and tossed the rest. Meh.  I'd be open to giving this place a second try but I'd def. order something else...",

We stumbled onto Big Wong and made our ways there. The placed was pretty empty, which was a plus for us. But I believe we arrived at an odd hour on a weekday. But either way, I was starving and I didn't have to wait long. The friendly waiter/host took our order. He didn't really recommend anything for first timers, but he did have a few pictures on the wall, that allowed you to see what some of the dishes looked like. I ordered Wonton Soup with Ramen, it was pretty good and the size of the bowl was definitely enough for two.  I definitely loved the wontons, they had a pretty good amount of shrimp inside and they were very flavor-able. I will definitely come back to try more dishes, the prices were inexpensive.",

Walked in... it is an empty restaurant at peak dinner time. This is the first red flag but I pressed on and hoping for good faith, support small local business, and trusting the reviews. Again, all wrong.   An Asian looking guy in a tall white chef hat walked out without a word and instructed us to sit. He brings the menus over without a word.   The menu is listed in both English and Traditional Chinese. This is like a Hong Kong Cafe menu (cha Chan Ten). I spoke Chinese to him to tell him that we are ready to order when he put down the tea. He said, what did you say?  I responded quickly and say sorry and speak in English. He took the order and left without another word.   Our orders arrived. The wonton noodle is soft and the broth is like instant noodle soup. The wontons  are ... don't know if it is fresh or not.   Yelpers bragged about the beef over rice is so good and stuff. That's what we ordered. WTF!  What's wrong with these people!  The dish came in with white rice, skinless boiled potatoes on the side. In another smaller dish is one paper thin Beef looking thing and a small bowl of brown sauce next to it.   After two bites of each dishes, we paid and left.   The same guy returned the changes to us.  He tossed the money on the counter for no reason. We never exchange another word other than ordering food. I never complain about anything. We were discrete. What is up with the attitude!  BIG WRONG:  you should closed the door if you do not want to do business.",

    "text": "Swung by here for breakfast since it's one of the few places that open at 10 am on a weekday. Ordered the following: 1) Hainan chicken: this portion size was huge but the chicken was basically just boiled and then put on the platter. good thing they give 2 different sauces to dip the chicken; otherwise - it wouldn't have been tasty. this is not a usual hainan style chicken we've had in los angeles! 3 stars 2) beef ramen w/ shrimp wontons: soup was quite flavorful and shrimp wontons were legit; beef cubes were very soft and tastes great. the ramen noodles were plentiful; couldn't even finish 3.5 stars 3) noodle soup w/ shrimp wontons + fish balls $8; this was egg noodle in a light broth, covered with shrimp wontons and chewy fish balls. I enjoyed the shrimp wontons, but could have done without the fish balls. I was hoping the fish balls were filled w/ minced meat but nope. egg noodles were chewy but soup was lacking in flavor. 3 stars  I think the main reason why this restaurant received 4 stars overall is because their food is very cheap / affordable and portion size is generous. The 3 dishes we got were only mediocre at best.",

Would definitely come here again in the future, especially if the ramen next door has a super long line and I'm not feeling like $24 for korean bbq or japanese curry.  We ordered a pai gu mian - fried pork chop with noodles and then some more noodles for my wife. They were simple, cheap, and delicious plates. My previous place where I went to go get fried pork chop noodles switched cooks/recipes about a year ago and I've been looking for something to fill the void ever since. This place is much more in a cantonese style restaurant with their recipes reflecting this. However, it's close enough to the taiwan version that I still prefer this over my previous place.   You're not coming here for something fancy, you're coming here for cheap comfort food. Don't expect good service or a fancy ambiance. The menus seats and tables will be just a bit sticky. Come here for the food, and the good times you'll have with your friends, significant other, or just to relax by yourself if you're flying solo. If you're a tourist maybe try something else, but if you live here, it's worth dropping by.",

It's located in probably the best food plaza on Spring Mountain so it easily gets overshadowed by Monta, Curry Zen, and Raku but wow! If you were to ask me to grab a quick bite to eat, I would choose Big Wong every single time now.   The menu items are based off of each other so if you're a lover of let's stay pork chop, you can literally have pork chop with rice or pork chop with noodle soup or even pork chop on its own! It's how they keep their prices so low but hey, I'm not complaining.   My go to order at Big Wong: Rib-eye over pasta and a side order of Roti. Whatever is in the rib-eye sauce has got me hooked. You get a good portion of meat, pasta, and potatoes for only $5! The Roti is a pancake that basically can go with anything (and it's only a dollar!!!).   The service is great as well! They seem to have only 5 people on staff per shift but they make it work. The older gentleman who seems to be the owner is able to cook, serve, and clean! He's quite the animated man whenever he interacted with us.   So thank you Big Wong. I'll be back soon!",

I decided to get the noodle soup with the white meat fried chicken with a side of roti. SO HEARTY; I originally wanted the dark meat fried chicken, but they were currently out, but the white meat fried chicken was still so good. The noodle soup was MASSIVE, but I enk nded up finishing it all because the broth was tasty and comforting for the cold weather. I also tried their salt and pepper chicken wings--YOU HAVE TO TRY IT OUT. I honestly can say they are the best chicken wings in town.  \\_()_/    The service was awesome, our waiter was attentive and friendly.  Friendly note: the plaza that it's located in is always super packed, so parking is a bitch to find~  I am so looking forward to my next visit to Big Wong!",

So I began frequenting somewhere familiar - I had been to Big Wong several times and it was the perfect fit...  The downlow: It's cheap, filling, and tasty.  I don't know what's better than 8 pieces of salt and pepper chicken wings (topped with jalapenos) for 4 dollars. That's 50 cents a wing!! Cheaper than BWW's 60 cent deal and also much larger and more delicious.  Besides the wings, I like to get shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles ($4) or the chicken with rice ($4). You can even choose the cuts of chicken you want, so I always go dark. When I'm eating with others, I like to get the sizzling ong choy ($5) which is a surprisingly HUGE hot plate. It's stir fried morning glory and tastes just like home. Portions are always generous. Seriously, I ordered the shrimp wonton soup thinking it would hold me over until my next meal but it got me stuffed! That little bowl is quite deceiving.  Other notable dishes are the chicken or beef curry, which you can dip roti (Asian crispy pancake) in and the sirloin beef with rice. Pretty much everything you order here will be good or reeeaaally good. It's no-frills food for those that are on a budget. The only thing I don't like that much is the salt and pepper pork because it isn't crispy.   Fare warning, the service isn't that spectacular. It's always the same lady working as cashier and serving/bussing tables so be patient. Aside from that, her brusque manner of speaking can be off-putting for those that put service as a priority. Bring cash unless you intend on spending a lot (which is nearly impossible).",

The shrimp in my noodles were still cold & the salt and pepper pork was soggy and lukewarm. The only thing I liked was the curry and roti.  I think they pre-cook and re-heat the food.

    "text": "Small little restraunt in China town next to Trattoria Nakamura in the same parking lot as Monta and Japanese Curry Zen.   With prices so cheap you really can't go wrong here and if you hate the food at least you won't break your wallet.   Small little restraunt but always enough seating. The owner doubles as cashier and waitress as well as the cooks. Even though it's not heavily staffed I've never had an issue with customer service or any problems here for that matter.   Small menu probably to keep prices down and it makes sense.  Everything I've had here is yummy never had anything here that wasn't good and for the price it's well portioned. Nothing is huge here just remember that.   Beef Ramen - I'm not a ramen fan so this I actually did enjoy. Not salty with chunks of beef brisket and tendon and noodles not overdone. I hate soggy noodles. Broth has a different flavor that I can't explain but is very comforting to the palette. Almost has a star anise flavor to it.   Baby bok choy - not sure if it was stir fried or steamed but I love veggies especially chinese greens. Still has bite which I liked.   Chicken Curry - not overly spiced has dark meat chicken and chunks of potato served with roti.   Roti - you could order this alone and be happy it's so buttery and flaky perfect for dipping in the curry. I could eat this all day everyday it's so bomb !   Fried chicken - this is an 18 minute wait and they will tell you before you order. It's crispy chicken they serve with a gravy. Kind of reminded me of jollibee fried chicken except jollibee has crispier KFC kind of crust on the chicken. This chicken is coated with a flour mixture. It's ok. Nothing too special about it.   Fried Shrimp Wontons - crispy wontons stuffed with shrimp what's not to love. I don't even like shrimp and I liked them. Mostly I liked the crispy fried wrapper.  Pork chop standard pork chop fried served with rice also served with gravy. Nothing too stand outish about this either.   Everything here is ok. If you're not looking to spend a ton of money big wongs is the way to go. It's definitely budget friendly",

So I was rewarded with some me time and decided to just drive. My stomach reminded me that it was way past dinner time and I unexpectedly ended up here. After looking at montas storefront with the crowds and long waits I figured, why is nobody giving Big Wong some love? I looked in my wallet and I had a crisp $10 bill waiting to be spent so I said to myself why not?  Now  I'm not Chinese but if I were I would assume that this is pretty much comfort food. I had their fried chicken over seasoned rice($1extra) and it sure hit the spot. It takes longer to cook the dark meat(about15 minutes) but I was ok with it. You get a generous portion of whatever ever dish you get. So far I've only had the fried porkchop over rice, hoinam chicken over rice, and the fried chicken over rice. I'll be coming back because I feel I should try everything on the menu especially the fried wonton shrimp. Some people across from my table was having that and I was compelled to ask those strangers if I can try a piece lol. But alas, I did not.  The guy at the register is a no frills no bs server. You come in, you order, you eat. Sometimes that's just what I need. No bs. Eat here. Give the guy money. And leave with a Happy stomach. A++. Thanks Big Wong. You're always coming through.",

Out of 200+ yelp reviews I've written, this is the worst service I've ever experienced in my entire life, from the owner nonetheless.  Let's start with the prices. Yes, this is the cheapest food you'll find on the planet. $5-6 for a full size entree including rice, meat, and veggies. Food comes out hot and fresh and presented nicely. Because of the low prices, the restaurant itself looks shabby. Sticky tables, uninspiring lighting, crappy chairs.   The food tastes decent. I wasn't blown away by it, but for 5 bucks I could come here for lunch every day and leave happy.  Now, the service. The instant we sat down, hungry with expectations, the owner strutted over wearing his white chef's hat. He threw the menus on the table without even looking at us. Lazily, he strutted away without uttering a word. He deposited water on the table. We asked for hot water. He scowled and left without a backwards glance.  We ordered and he wrote it down, again silent. No smile, no acknowledgement we had even been heard. When the food came, he shoved it at us. A member of my party was reading a newspaper; he shoved the food into the newspaper. Disgusting.",

Pros- authentic Chinese food, speedy service, and low prices.  I told them I was hungry and the dedicated chef(I've seen the same guy cooking every time I've eaten here, making great and consistent dishes) served me my dish right away.  The curry has it's standard delishesness, but unlike other restaurants, this stuff was authentic Hong-Kong-style flavors.  I've tried the wonton noodle, and they gave me the biggest wonton in my soup.  The value of this restaurant is amazing.  (5 stars)  Cons- I can see how people expect a fancy restaurant with Dragon statues and large Chinese symbols to display \"prosperity\", but I'm more about the \"mom and pop\" shops with home-grown flavors that can reminds me of childhood.  (5 stars)",

On the other hand, if you come with an open mind (and maybe an empty tummy) you'll leave satisfied.  At Big Wong (gotta love the name)I felt far removed from Vegas and more like I was in SF (this place was reminiscent of my old hood). I was pleased with our choices the salt and pepper shrimp (I ate the heads, tails and all the sliced chilies too) and the shrimp soup with wontons. This little place, be it simple, was alright in my book. I would definitely go back and with my kids next time to share the \"experience.\"",

But don't fret, there are pictures of the dishes on the walls. I got the chicken curry with noodles. It was really good and I think it was like 6 bucks. Really dude? Dinner for 6 bucks?  We also feasted on the garlic broccoli; yeah, you might want to hit that too.  Ok, all you ingrates who are whining about the service, get over it.  It's China Town.  They don't smile too much and they take their time.  So what. The food is good and ridiculously cheap. If you want good service go to the cheesecake factory and try to get some authentic Chinese food there.  Go on, leave, right now and go to the cheesecake factory. Yeah, I didn't think so.  Just enjoy it. You're lucky this place is here.  Make sure you try the shrimp won tons and when you leave tip them and be grateful they don't cut you.",

This place really hit the spot. We ordered the Chicken Wings, House Seafood Noodle Soup, Curry w/ Roku, and Han-Nan Chicken. All I can say is damn. The Chicken Wings were freshly fried, hot and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Well seasoned and packed with a lot of flavor. The house seafood soup was a very generous portion - loaded with fish, crab meat, tempura/oden/fish balls. Great chewy consistency on the noodles and served in a light seafood broth. The curry was tasty, loaded with spices, but I think the large chunks of potatoes took away from the meal. The Roku pancakes it was served with was a delicious dipping tool. Lastly, and probably my favorite, was the Han-Nan Chicken. Tender cuts of steamed chicken served with two dipping sauce and accompanied by the most tasty chicken broth rice I've ever had. The best part of this place is our total for 3 entrees and a side came out to be 18 dollars total. I will be back!  A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

She suggested some of the more popular dishes like the fried shrimp wontons and the fried chicken wings. We ended up ordering both of those along with Ong Choy (water spinach) Thai style, mango and almond pudding and the sweet roti pancake.  Everything was so good! My friends had never had Ong Choy before and loved the first plate so much were ordered another plate! We didnt know how big the roti pancakes were going to be so we ordered 2 to start but ended up ordering 2 more because they were small (about the size of my hand) and very delicious! Did I mention they were only a dollar?!   The bill for the 5 of us came out to be 35 including tip! Another reason to love this place, it's so cheap.

In my three visits here, I have tried the beef ramen, beef curry, chicken wings, salt and pepper pork chops, garlic chinese broccoli, mango pudding and almond pudding.  All were pretty good with the stand outs being the chicken wings and the almond pudding.  The chicken wings were crispy without being breaded and nicely spicy since it is served with hot peppers.  The almond pudding takes me back to growing up in Hawaii.    Overall, the decor and ambiance would normally get a deduction of a point from me, but the LOW prices get extra credit earning the star back.",

The service is lacking (we didn't get water refills and were thirsty for a good 10 mins), but hey I'm willing to deal with that in exchange for price and taste. We kinda felt bad anyway because it seems there's only one old guy taking everyone's orders and bringing the food out-- he was everywhere. They serve you with a styrofoam cup and plastic utensils which is weird for eating in, and disappointing because of all trash it must produce. When it comes to food, we've had the chicken curry, beef ramen, chicken wings, fried chicken, and almond pudding-- all of them delicious!!!",

We stumbled upon Big Wong in this plaza when the sushi place we wanted was closed and I refused to eat Japanese curry (I can't acquire the taste for Japanese curry although I've tried numerous times). I was very glad we came across this place for a number of reasons: 1. I was hung over and spent a lot of money buying drinks at XS the night before, so cheap food is a win. The items here were super affordable. 2. There were 6 of us and the place was not crowded, thus we were seated as soon as we walked in. 3. The food was very good for this price -- I had the beef ramen and OH, HOW TENDER IS THE BEEF? SO TENDER. It was the perfect hangover food. As soon as I finished, my nausea was gone and tummy was fulfilled. Service was quick, and our server was friendly and helpful.",

I also enjoy the salt pepper chicken wings, pork chops but the best is the salt and pepper fish. The house chicken is simple and great with the two sauces they are served with, a sweet chili and like a soy sesame oil sauce. My wife digs the fried wontons because they are fried golden crispy and delicious. The curry is good. The sweet roti kicks taste bud ass. That's mostly what I've tried.

THIS is a reality show folks!   The food is O-K. Nothing that wows, but for the price, I'm not complaining. On a cold Vegas winter night, the wonton soup will warm you up and fill you up for the rest of the evening. The wings were CRISPY but a bit salty. Pork chop was a bit soggy and salty for my tastes. I'll definitely come back for the wings though.   We'll come again when our wallet and stomach is empty.",

The lady who works there was ALWAYS friendly to me. In fact, I remember her being warm and jovial. However, the last time we went, it was like she did a 180 and was a totally different person. She was curt, short, awkward, and borderline rude. In fact, I totally agree with Steven P's review of how she acted.   If it wasn't for the first few times, I would probably also give a lower rating, perhaps 2 stars, based on this last interaction. But with my past experiences, and the fact that I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, I took away only one star with the intention to go back again. However, if service was anything like the last time, I would probably pick another spot in Chinatown to eat from now on.  To be continued...",

After a quick Yelp search, we were on the way to Big Wong. Unfortunately, we found out that they were out of jook when we got there. What a bummer!  We ended up still ordering wonton noodles, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and Hainanese chicken. Everything was good, though nothing was spectacular. The noodles in the wonton noodles were a bit rough and they do not serve the ginger sauce that traditionally comes with the Hainanese chicken.

Kind of reminds me of Sam Woo BBQ in Irvine, but with a more limited menu.  We ordered #2 (Hainan boneless dark meat chicken with special seasoned rice), #5 (Special boneless dark meat deep fried chicken with rice) and #15 (Special Beef Stew in oyster sauce).  The Hainan chicken is similar to the white cut chicken that I make at  home. It came with 2 dipping sauces: the red was kind of spicy, the other was more soy sauce-based, and more to our liking. The seasoned rice was flavorful.  The special deep fried chicken is like the crispy fried chicken served at Cantonese restaurants, but without the seasoned salt, lemon  wedge and shrimp chips. It came with another dipping sauce.   The special beef stew is like Hubby's favorite Ngow Nom (Chinese Beef Stew made with star anise and often with daikon radish and tendon), but this came as a soup with noodles.  Overall, good food with familiar homestyle flavors at reasonable prices.",

On top of that, the several items we ordered on the menu were okay. I had the authentic chicken curry over rice which looked like a popular item on the menu, but my friend and I agreed that it tasted kinda bland. Other items that we tried were the curry beef with noodle soup and the beef ramen with tendon...all of which were okay, nothing too fantastic. The one item on the menu that served to redeem this place were their fried shrimp wontons. Those came out freshly fried and crispy with a soft shrimp filling that reminds you of dim sum in the morning mmm. I also liked that everything was decently priced for the amount of food that you get.",

    "text": "Located on Spring Mountain Road, a street of constant turnover featuring approximately two-hundred eateries at any given time, it was in an intentional attempt to avoid Las Vegas Boulevard that New Year's Eve was spent at Big Wong Restaurant, the casual Chinese spot located in the same plaza as the likes of Raku and Kabuto proving both affordable and appetizing in addition to offering surprisingly efficient service.  Originally opened in the middle of 2011 and largely unchanged in terms of decoration or menu over the intervening 6.5 years as judged by photographs, the interior clean and brightly lit with images of the Restaurant's cuisine hanging on walls, guests entering Big Wong can expect to be greeted quickly by a man standing at the counter, his directions as to where to sit gauged by party size with a server quickly emerging to provide laminated menus.  Small in size and more limited in scope that other nearby Restaurants, the double-sided menu featuring some sixty choices largely revolving around items such as Chicken, Beef, Pork or Shrimp in a variety of preparations including a Starch and Curry or Soup, it was after being told that no Congee was available at 7:00pm that the decision was instead made to focus elsewhere, a total of three plates plus Rice, extra Noodles and Water tallying just $30.  Unsurprisingly not packed given the holiday, but still doing brisk take-out business to an almost universally Asian clientele, it was just as Water was refilled by request that plates came forth from the kitchen one after another, the portion-sizes about what one would expect for the area with the bowl of Curry Beef and Ramen easily enough to feed two given the ample amount of springy Noodles and tender braised Meat floating in a pool of Orange Broth.  Having not really paid attention to tablemate's orders after being disappointed regarding the Rice Porridge, a second-choice of store-bought Fish Balls presented similar to the Beef but without Noodles for $1.50 less, it was atop a Soy-slicked scoop of Rice that the mild orbs made rich by Curry and Turmeric were enjoyed before turning attention to a smaller cup of boiled Chicken, the blend of Dark Meat and Breast well-cooked, juicy throughout and delicious whether on its own or atop crispy fried Roti.",

    "text": "I'm super disappointed with this place. Not only was service almost non-existent, the food wasn't even great. I don't know how they were able to get so many good reviews. We went in around dinner time but there were only 2 other tables. There were several workers (I think one of them was the owner) just chilling at the front counter, and they didn't say \"hi\" or anything to us when we walked in. We awkwardly said \"hello\" in a polite tone, and they didn't say anything back.. well I guess we shouldn't have been expecting much from a Chinese restaurant when it comes to customer service, but a greeting is a basic when you work in a restaurant industry. I know this because I was working as a server during my early days!  The food was also very bland, no particular flavor. My beef in ramen was undercooked, I'm so glad I didn't finish them. I honestly think I could have cooked better myself. There are many restaurants out there that serve better food with great customer service. Do yourself a favor and skip this place.",

I was initially a bit suspicious of a place with $5-10 meal options near a $50-150 restaurant, but while it is different, in its own way it is just as good -- I now happily go to both.  Standard popular-in-America options (wonton soup, various noodles), and good filling food like chicken curry; you really can't go wrong. Most dishes are $6-8 in 2017 in a city which is otherwise far more expensive. Big fan of Big Wong.",

First, the positives: 1) The prices are reasonable 2) The Latino gentleman who delivered our food was professional and courteous. The negatives: 1) Why would you put a MAN suffering from PMS as the hostess?  Seriously, he doesn't want to be there.  He exudes discontent for life and negativity.   2) I think they are trying to make fusion food (definition: they can't cook authentic food).  The curry has something sour in it.  I have had Indian/Malay/Japan/Chinese curries and their version is completely unique in flavor.  As for their beef stew noodle soup, the temperature wasn't even near hot.   3) This comment is not the fault of the restaurant but it is extremely difficult to find a parking spot during meal times.

That said, keep in mind that it is a $5 restaurant...this is neither the time nor place to try new, interesting food. Stick with the basics and you'll be just fine.  I thought my shrimp wonton noodles (4.5/5) were just as they should be. The wontons weren't very big, but they did contain an ample amount of shrimp. The broth was a very simple chicken broth with nothing special added (not even scallions!) and there was a decent amount of noodles. Solid comfort food if you ask me.  Other entrees ordered included: Fried pork chop noodles (2/5) - incredibly salty. House special steamed chicken over rice (1/5) - just terrible. Do not order. Shrimp wonton and beef stew in clear broth with noodle (4.5/5)   Additionally, the salt and pepper wings were very good (4.5/5). While flavor didn't penetrate the interior very well, the wings were perfectly crisp and amazingly juicy inside. Also for $4.95, this plate came with (9) jumbo wings - unheard of!  In regards to people claiming the hostess as rude, my family hardly had that experience. In fact, she was rather attentive...granted, we did all our ordering in Cantonese, which may have made a difference.",

Chinese service is pretty notorious for not being friendly and efficient, so keep in mind that you will not be treated like royalty.    My recommendations would be the Chinese bok choy or ong choy with garlic flavor, and a must try would be the salt and pepper shrimp, pork, or chicken. Those final three items come with a little bit of spice, and probably some heroin because they are so addicting!    I hope you give this place a try based off of price and flavor.",

So, pass on this.  Garlic chinese broccoli was tasty.  It is served in a sizzling platter so you get the crunchiness of the sear. Curry chicken is good with the roti.  Fried chicken wings are tasty but pass on the salt and pepper pork.  Also lacking in flavor. I'd definitely come back for a bowl of wonton soup. Will try some other items next time",

I've frequented Snow Flake Shavery which is just across the parking lot, but I never quite made it into Big Wong's, until now!  Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by all the great, CHEAP eats!  We ordered  Salt and pepper chicken wings: these were nicely fried and MOIST! Is that your favorite word?! They were JOOOOSAY! And they were accompanied by sliced jalapenos. YAAAS!  Salt and pepper pork chops: these were also nicely fried with the lovely jalapenos as well AND they came out SLICED, unlike other places, so I really did appreciate that!  Steamed Chicken and rice: this is a pretty basic dish. Steamed chicken! What do you expect?! You can feel nice and healthy eating it tho and it comes with a dipping sauce. The chicken rice thingy was very good too! Had a hint of chicken flavor and MOIST!  Ong choy (light garlic): This veg is SO damn good. I mean REALLY!!! I believe it's called Water Spinach in the English language and i could just it ALL damn day!  Wonton Soup: I'm not really a fan of wonton soup anyway, this wasn't very exciting for me, but I forgive them! Bottom line is this place is GOOOOOOD and it is CHEAAAAP! Everything is around $5-6/plate. I definitely recommend this spot and will mos def be back!  Nom nom nom!",

The noodle soup was amazing - giant portion, lots of shrimp, and your choice of noodle. Mild spice. It was only $4.95!  The congee was around $3 for the biggest bowl of rice ever.

It is not the \"yellow\" chicken that normally serve with chicken rice but instead it is the regular chicken foster farm chicken.  It is only $8-$9, you get what you paid for.  But I would rather pay more for the \"yellow\" chicken.  5 stars for the rice but 1 star for the chicken.   Wonton noodle soup- surprising it is not as good as the deep fried wonton, 3 stars.

Our 2yr old loved the shrimp wonton noodle soup and devoured the wontons and soup. Nibbled on the noodles but we ended up finishing it for him. Was tasty and simple.  While I love ong choy, wouldn't order it here again. It was a little too oily and they weren't as fresh as we would be liked.

My grandpa and father, who are very traditional Chinese and often hard to please, actually really enjoyed this place (which garners towards their authenticity).  The parking was a little difficult, but we eventually found a spot.    One of the biggest selling points was the price point of the food for the quantity you get.  The restaurant was a little empty, and they ran out of congee (rice porridge) but overall a great experience, with authentic home cooked Asian food.  All the silverware provided was plastic, which felt a little cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.",

I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now.   Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.  Anyways they give you super small water cups.  So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it.   So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.  The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?  And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.  I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.  But we are all positive that they got chicken.  She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.  No arguing with that right?  So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.  Needless to say she messed up.  There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.  Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.  Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks.   Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party.   3.5-4 stars for the food and price but 2 overall.",

The guy was very thankful for our business, too.   A word about To Go orders: They use the high quality black plastic To Go containers with the clear lids that you can reuse over and over. They're much more expensive than the standard Styrofoam containers. That makes their prices even more amazing   Now,  if they only had a drive through,",

Don't come here expecting the best customer service- lady up front I've seen is running around by herself, so don't be too harsh. The hearty food and low price that goes along with it makes up for their lack of customer service. Everything I tried (Hoi Nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, won ton soup, salt and pepper wings (YUM), and curry with roti) was surprisingly authentic tasting. Definitely fulfills your craving for Asian food without putting a dent in your wallet. I'm more than satisfied! Will be back for the salt and pepper wings! Not taking their customer service into consideration, 5 stars for food and affordability.",

    "text": "Mr. Wong, the man himself, spoke with me today. First time in a year. Kudos to him for the original name of the restaurant and not falling into the trap of Big Wang. I'm serious. Do a search. There are about 5 billion results. Now search for Big Wong. It's the first result. Now, it could be that I'm in Vegas and the local results are being pushed to me, but I prefer not to think in such pessismistic terms. Being the #1 Big Wong is a massive accomplishment.  Of course, I don't come for the conversation. I'm a frequent diner here with my classmates. Why? Where else can you get salt and pepper chicken wings for $4.95? This kinda thing doesn't even happen in the SGV. My friends from Taiwan and China approve of Big Wong. That's gotta be worth something. It's comfort food at its finest. They even accept credit cards.   -The wings come out smoking from the deep fryer the second they're cooked. I've personally witnessed this. The chef in the back makes a hand signal, the wings are rushed onto the griddle, and the owner rushes it to your table. They're extra crispy with just the right amount of salt and copious amounts of thinly sliced peppers.  -The Ong Choy is always crunchy, fresh, and would not cause me concern if it were to come from my mom's hands. Multiple options are also offered -- get it garlic cooked, Thai style, or with soy paste. All is not perfect though -- the dish is sometimes served with too many stems, and not enough leaves. Still a great value at $5.95.   -The seasoned rice tastes great. I would eat it by itself. Combine it with ribeye for $4.95. FOUR-NINETY-FIVE. See the theme yet? Extraordinary. Just extraordinary.   Thank you for all you do, Mr. Wong. You are a real man of genius.",

It was quite nice because my dad who has worked in a Chinese restaurant for over thirty five years himself is a very difficult person to please when it comes to eating out and he had nothing but praises, especially for their gravy, saying they did everything right.  Pro: Great affordable prices, perfectly deep fried foods, home cooked style, personable service.  Con: Smaller operation, therefore service can be slow at times; or it can even be more of a hustle and bustle type of place.  Unique: Mango pudding and the almond with lychee, both desserts made with real fruit and not artificial like most Asian places.  They have the best Thai Coffee in town, works better than any other coffee out there in all of Clark County.  This review was last updated on 10/23/2015.",

But you really can't go wrong with fried foods until I tried the salt and pepper shrimp no seasoning or flavor. Maybe there was a new chef but this place sucked really bad I would not recommend this place at all. Maybe it was to authentic for me. No it sucked",

    "text": "After an exhausting weekend of alcoholic sins and gluttonous,late-night dining, my friends and I were looking for a simple, wallet-friendly meal before heading home.  Thanks to our trusty Yelp app, we fond Big Wong's and was impressed by the # of positive reviews for a place that has seemingly RIDICULOUSLY low prices!  I'm from the San Gabriel area so I'm accustomed to cheap food, but Big Wong's pricing is almost TGTBT and makes you question what ingredients they use....  However, 3 days after my meal, I have survived w/o any gastrointestinal isues and in fact, feel pretty good (thanks to my cheap meal @ Big Wong's!)  As for the venue itself, it is located in the heart of the Las Vegas \"Chinatown\" (but feels more like Westminster) area and is within a smal strip mall with numerous other asian-based restaurants and businesses (foot massage anyone?)  Once you enter Big Wong, you'll see a traditionally simple restaurant, clean, bare, and most likely somewhat empty.  However don't be offput by the lack of lines like at Marquee or XS, this is a good thing :)  The menu options are actually quite expansive, and include many many recognizable (and comfortable when you're tired/hungover) items.  I had the \"thin ribeye with rice\" dish that was okay in taste; a bit lean on the meat, heavy on the white rice, but my standard were so freaking low that I was still happy.  The sauce it comes with is a bit bland....so I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you are really looking to eat light.    My companions tried the Hainan chicken, which was average..but my standards are based on Savoy's kitchen which has the best Hainan Chicken known to my existanec.  My other friend had a pho-like noodle dish that he said tasted good and it was pretty sizeable.  Finally, we all shared a portion of crispy chicken wings which I actually enjoyed! Not too oily or greasy, nice and flavorful with unidentifiable spices/seasonings.    Every single item we ordered was $4.95 which INCLUDES TAX!!! OMFG deal of the century in las vegas (even better than the $6.99 steak and eggs @ Bills).  Total cost after tip  $23  VIVA LAS VEGAS AS AN ASIAN!!",

She gave us the menu and asked what we wanted to drink. I was craving some shrimp and I was debating whether I should get fried shrimp wonton or house special shrimp wonton soup in the end, I decided to get the fried shrimp wonton. The fried shrimp wonton comes with one big shrimp in each of the wonton wrapper. It was so delicious and had a lot of flavors. The serving was big, it comes with 10 pieces.   I got to try some of the other food they serve in their menu. I had to taste the other shrimp-- house special shrimp wonton soup. The broth is tasty and not too salty. The wonton also has one big piece of shrimp in it. I also tried the curry beef over rice, it's very spicy but I can still tolerate it. The beef is tender and juicy. The curry has a lot of flavor, it taste different from what I had before but it's very good.    How can I forget about the sweetened roti, this is one of my favorite dessert since I tried this. Roti is an Indian flat bread that is bake like a pizza, they put condense milk and powdered sugar on top of the flat bread. Yes, it's unhealthy but I don't usually order desert whenever I dine in to a restaurant.  Yes, I'm in love with this place.",

My bf ordered the beef ramen with tendon. It was a fish comparable to Monta soy broth noodles. The also ordered the ong choy sauteed with garlic. Very good!!!

It takes 15 minutes to make but well worth it.   AND, hate to disclose this since it's in limited batches, but the best BEST thing on the menu is on the wall as a special. Steamed Chicken with Mushrooms, served with rice, veg, and chinese sausage. It's the owner's family recipe and it's just brilliant. It's like what your mom (if your mom was a loving caring chinese lady) would cook to make you feel better after getting fired from work, car broke down, got a divorce, dumped by your mistress, lost all your money to a ponzi scheme, and stepped in a deep puddle in your brand new Ferragamos you bought retail. It's soothing, especially in our chilly desert nights.   Go. That's an order.",

It reminds me of Big Wong's in NYC that we went to when we were slepping around from Boston to NYC.  The place is in a crappy shopping center but the food is great. It's cheap and good. The restrooms are clean as heck. The staff very friendly. No, you white folks, no need to worry about rude asian servers here. Yes, I get them too. I hate when they throw my food at me. I intend to try every dish that they have. Took my coworkers here and they loved it too. So maybe they will help with the business. I hate to see another good place go down the tubes in this economy.  So what do they serve besides a friendly, non-pretentious atmosphere? Well for starters, the walls do have a lot of stuff on them, menu items, like a lot of other Chinese restaurants. But wait! They are written in English unlike the ones that will remain nameless here, Anna's Garden, Noodle Palace, KJ's Kitchen. Oh the waitress speaks great English too btw. My Chinese is bad so I'll keep a lid on it.  My friend really liked their pancake and curry chicken (roti pancake). It's more like nan bread then a waffle or whatever pancakes are made of. I hate pancakes so I cannot relate.  I have had their wonton without the noodles and it's really good. I think all their noodle dishes are good and tasty. Most items are less than $5 so you might was well eat here versus spending it on a Big Mac. Spend it on a Big Wong instead.",

    "text": "I seriously love mom and pop places and this place... I LOVE THIS PLACE. I imagine that this is the kind of restaurant that the parents of David S. would open up if they ever decided to do so. It feels homey, and all the food tastes like it's made by someone who seriously puts his/herself in the place of their customers when they make it. Plus, all the dishes arse pretty much in the $5-10, which is freakin' amazing since the other Chinese place that my family likes to frequent doesn't even come close to that kind of price range, especially for the quality and portion of food that Big Wong has.   Let me just say that those chicken wings are super addicting and I've been dreaming about them since I first tried it 3 weeks ago. Crunchy, crispy, hot, tender and juicy on the inside... totally to die for. The beef ramen had nice big chunks of tendon-y cuts of beef that taste like they've been stewing for a long time. They're tender and are NOT chewy, AND they ask you if you want tendons in your soup. (UH, HELL YES I DO!) The broth is clear and perfectly seasoned, and the noodles are the eggy hong-kong style that I wish I had more experience in reviewing. But they were really tasty to me.   Between my cousin and I, we had the ramen, one of the chicken specials that was a steamed chicken with sauce on the side served over rice, and the chicken wings, and not only was everything way under $20, but it was delicious and filling as well.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas, and as we were driving up there he was telling me about this great restaurant called Big Wong he's been hearing about from a friend. We decided we would give it a shot due to all the great reviews we read about..  When we got there, there was a hostess/waitress who looked really irritated to see us. She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the double Fish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas.  We got our drinks in a styrofoam cup. It was weird but I guess that's their norm. I drank it pretty quickly since it was small, and had to ask for a water within 5 minutes. Also a styrofoam cup.  We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny.   Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional.  Also, the waitress who was unfriendly the whole time, was on the verge of unpleasant. She seemed like she didn't want to be there serving us the whole time and I felt the negative vibe.   Overall, this restaurant is cool if you're looking for acceptable quality in the food and cheap prices. Our total bill came out to only $20 so it wasn't bad. Make sure if you do go, try the wings. It'll make the trip worthwhile",

In fact, I was shocked that this restaurant was getting such rave reviews.  Perhaps I had come on a bad day.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes.  Anyways, I decided to give it another try because I was craving Ramen and the wait at Monta was ridiculous.  And I am now grateful that Monta was so busy because I am a converted fan.  My husband and in-laws ordered the Beef Ramen with tendons.  The broth was so delicious, the tender beef was plentiful, as was the tendons.  Just a perfect bowl of soup on a cold winter night.    I had plans to order the Ramen also, but when I saw the \"Special shrimp soup with wontons\" advertised on the wall- I just could not resist.  The broth was just bursting with shrimpyness.  My husband didn't  like it for that exact reason, but I was swooning.  It must have taken a lot of shrimp heads to pack that much flavor into that bowl.  I usually never ever finish my bowls of soup, but I just could not stop eating it.  I was already full, but thought it would be such a shame to let this deliciousness go to waste.    Thank you Monta for being so crowded because Big Wong has found a new loyal fan in me.  Even my VERY Chinese in-laws who we literally had just picked up from the airport after a long flight from Hong Kong gave it 2 thumbs up.  And trust me, that is no easy feat.",

Already tried a few dishes: the beef ramen $5.95, the pork chop with udon $4.95, 2 different chicken and rice dishes $4.95 ea., steak and rice dish $4.95... the chef is more than willing to adjust a dish to your needs (for example, I order everything extra spicy. He doesn't just throw in hot sauce either, he actually cooks the broth spicy!).   There is a great selection on the menu... rice, noodles, soups, curries, vegetables, etc. A daily special is listed on the wall.   Their ramen and udon noodle soups are FANTASTIC; however, they are missing vegetables. It's just noodles and broth with meat in the bowl or on the side. They do provide a metal container of green onions to add to the soup, but I think the dishes would be 5 stars if they had more substance (onions, cabbage, bamboo, etc..) However, if you don't like vegetables, this place is definitely for you!  So in a nutshell... great food, decent service (authentic Chinese-style), unbeatable prices, and dishes come out quickly. I most certainly recommend it!",

Service is attentive and food is out quick. Soups are all fabulous: the wonton skins used are not cheap and the quality is evident when you bite into the shrimp-packed parcels. Broth was very flavorful and had just a bit of a spicy kick to it. Strongly prefer the udon noodles to the ramen noodles that are your other option. Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.  BEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender. STEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens. Flavorful sauce is light, sausage is salty, and flavors complement one another for a balanced dish. SALT AND PEPPER WINGS are very salty and very peppery. Pretty sure this is not a dish you could order by itself, as even to eat just three of them I had to space out bites of wing with that of other dishes- if you have HBP you might want to steer clear, as the salt in this dish was quite high.  Vegetable dishes here are solid: the baby bok choy in garlic sauce is my favorite (second only to the one at Ichiza but the portion here is  three times the size), and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is a staple as well.",

I ordered chicken curry with roti, the stir fry vegetable dishes (all 3), udon with fried chicken, lamb egg noodle soup, mango puddling and the dessert roti. My family and I ordered roughly 12 dishes and the bill only came out to $67. The owner of the restaurant (who wear a chef's hat) speaks English so anyone can come here.  The prices per dish were $5-$11, but the quantity is more than fair for the price you are paying. Definitely will come back here again and their prices are unbeatable.",

Extremely affordable food that is also super delicious! Hainan chicken just like my mom makes. It is steamed chicken, very juicy and tender, over a bed of garlic rice. It comes with a ginger sauce and is absolutely excellent with the chicken broth, only $1! The salt and pepper porkchops were also very yummy. Not as crispy as I would like, however very flavorful and no bones. We also ordered the garlic Gai Lan which was cooked to perfection..   The prices are great an the proportions were still large! My fiance and were each able to pack a box to eat for lunch the next day. Can't wait to go back!",

There is usually only one guy working, which I have come in when the place is full and I feel so bad for him, working all by himself. They need to hire at least another person.   The food and the price you cannot beat! I always get their Hainan Chicken and Rice, the two sauces that come with the rice are so good!! The black sauce is sweet and savory and the red sauce has a nice kick to it but not crazy spicy!   Their fried wontons are delicious, usually can only get those exact ones when I go eat Dim Sum, but it is nice to be able to order them here.   Their wonton soups are also really good... haven't tried much else because I always come for the Hainan Chicken.",

Eats:  Ong Choy (Thai style) - It's some green veggie that is super crunchy and served on a sizzling plate. I love garlic and they are quite generous with the garlic In this dish!  Shrimp Wontons - There is hardly any fillers in there, it's almost all shrimp!  We're pleased with every visit, the female waitress kind of knows us and is starting to warm up to us lol.

    "text": "Big Wong is that 1 place my family & I always find ourselves going back to. Their food is  good, but affordable ($5 dishes) & fresh. They are consistent: the quality of their food has remained the same since we discovered them over a year ago.  Hubby & I always order the same thing: seasoned rice & fried shrimp wontons, which are both phenomenal. They know exactly how to make the FSW's (ancient Chinese secret?), & seem to have the recipe down to a science. While I don't know the recipe for it, I believe they roll out the fresh wonton wrapper to a precise thinness, & then fry it in fresh oil at a specific temperature, for X number of minutes. This method results in a crispy (yet not exceedingly greasy) wonton wrapper. If you've eaten a lot of mediocre & MSG-laden Chinese food, you'll notice the difference.  The place itself is small & simple, so unassuming that it's the perfect facade for a magical kitchen where the chopsticks & wonton wrappers (probably) come to life to sing & dance at night. Srsly though, we saw Nicolas Cage by Big Wong once, & that's made Big Wong even more memorable for us. We've eaten at Big Wong so many times that we've kind of become friends with the main server, a Thai guy named Paul.  What does baffle us about BW is how it never seems to be as packed as we figure it ought to be. In a way, we like that, but we honestly believe that anyone that hasn't tried their food is missing out.",

They get all their ingredients fresh every morning and everything is made to order. Average price for a dish here is about 6 dollars so definitely a great option if you're ballin on a budget. Their salt and pepper pork chop is different than other chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain but just as yummy- if not even MORE yummy! Their seasoned rice is a must have too. This time around we also tried their beef ramen. It's not the whole shabang like what you'll find at dedicated ramen joints but the broth is delicious and they are very generous with their super duper tender beef. I knocked off a star because service is mediocre - had to wait for water and was acknowledged multiple times when said we were ready to order but took quite sometime for someone to actually come over and take it. This won't stop me from coming here though - ITS JUST THAT GOOD.   FYI parking in this shopping center can be a pain to find.",

We walked inside and were greeted by a woman who sat us and gave us two thin one page menus , we thought it was just the lunch menu so we asked for a dinner one and to our surprise that was the only menu they had . They are very \"authentic \" no Americanized items at all , they didn't have any fried rices or multiple beef options or chicken options , no egg drop soups no eggrolls nothing ! They offer things like fish head soups and lots fish dinners , Chicken in a bowl with veggies and other weird stuff . We got two hard boiled eggs soaked in soy sauce as a complementary appetizer, and they were disgusting and smelled spoiled ! Our food came out and it was disgusting meat floating in a bowl , random sauces nothing was explained it was all horrible ! I understand \"authentic \" but they should have American traditional items as well as all types of people go to Chinese restaurants . Are server never came around or acknowledged us , we left and didn't eat anything ! This place is extremely authentic with very few options and limited menu ! Many many other places in area and around Vegas pick anyone of them over this place !",

I ordered their noodle soup with egg noodles and wonton. I was the happiest person because the broth was just SO SIMPLE yet delicious!!! I felt like a kid again haha. My room mate ordered the steamed chicken with rice and they really give you a good amount! Plus it was delicious with the sauce they had. Drool!!   We also tried their salt and pepper fish, which I love how they had so much jalapeno slices in it. Every bite of fish, you had some chili with it. Yum!  I love their sizzling veggies they offered. You can season it with garlic as an option. Kinda hard to describe but they serve it in a sizzling plate. It was great!  The roti and curry was also delicious. I'm such a sucker for roti and curry sauce. Maybe it's the pleasure of eating with my hands which I feel like it makes food fun and taste better lol. Maybe not in public.. do it at home haha! I'll update the review once I try more things. I just keep ordering the same things. Happy eating!",

We did get our order quickly, but the food was lacking flavor. The meal was very average and I could easily make the same meal at home. We ordered the authentic hoi nam chicken over special seasoned rice and wonton soup. Both dishes were very bland. The use of plastic forks and cups for dining in made the place very cheap in terms of profit wise.The only good thing about this restaurant is that the prices are very cheap, but I wouldn't come back here again if I was craving for something delicious.",

If anything (you think) it's more along the lines of 'Little Saigon' (due to amounts of delicious Pho places), or, maybe one could even call it 'Seoul Town' in relation to great Korean BBQ -- or, 'Taiwanese Town' in relation to its spectacular Boba Milk locations.   But when I stumbled on #BigWongs, man, their chefs turned everything in knew upside down, putting an exclamation point on 'We ARE China Town!' with their traditional simplified plates, and sizzling Chinese broccoli.   So, if you're on the hunt for real Chinese food, take it from me, you'll not need look further. FIVE STARS BABY!",

The skins were not too thick.  The Chinese greens in the soup were tender and a perfect accent. Even the stems were soft. The noodle portion was enormous-I couldn't even finish it! The atmosphere was spacious, clean and quiet. The staff was very friendly and efficient.  When I finished, I knew I would be a returning customer when I saw my bill. $7.04.  For the win.

    "text": "The food is not great but the food is not bad either. However, one thing is definitely certain...the food is CHEAP.   I don't go to Big Wong very often but sometimes I do when I want some cheap Chinese food. My most recent visit, my brother and I came here for lunch after he picked me up from work.   My brother got their wanton noodle soup and I settled for their hainan chicken with rice. They have several options for it: you can get white meat, dark meat, and each of those also have a bone in option. I went with the boneless dark meat version because I'm lazy.  They gave such a hearty portion with the dish. It's a dish of rice and a dish of chicken. They give you some hot sauce, soy sauce, but they don't automatically give you the ginger sauce? I had to ask for it. Their rice was really yummy -- it had enough flavor. It was a bit on the softer side though. Chicken, on the other hand, is very normal. It's just boiled chicken but they cooked it too long I think because the texture was a bit tough.  Their wantons were really good though! Very classic -- full of shrimp goodness instead.   Sometimes, I actually like to just stop by and buy some stir fried veggies to go. They sell tong choy for like $7 a dish versus $15 like some places. I have also had their congee but unfortunately, their congee needs more salt hahaha.   Good portions. Good price. Decent places to have a cheapo meal :)",

Waited a few minutes and looked at the staff if they were going to take or orders, everyone just looked away and looked miserable. Host took a few of peoples take out orders that came after us and watched 3 of them leave with their orders before we decided this customer service wasnt worth the wait. The staff just watched us leave and the host didnt even bother, just stood there looking at his papers. Im not an impatient person but this place just felt sad and miserable.

The hostess/waitress today was extremely rude. She was probably in her late 30's early 40's, had moderately long black hair, wore glasses. I had asked her if she could heat up our toddlers food (which we brought because he has severe food allergies). Her response was \"We don't have a microwave, look at our place, we don't have room for a microwave. What is that???!! I don't even know what that is?!\" (as she pointed to the food we brought). She had terrible attitude and manners. She then proceeded to pick up a personal phone call as we just stood in front of her in shock.  The hostess finally asked the chef to heat up our food and we quietly sat down at the table. She saw our toddler playing with a pair of chopsticks that were in a tall container and she quickly came over and without a word, snatched the container of chopsticks away, took out a handful of chopsticks and threw on the table in front of me and walked away. We have never felt so disrespected. We just stood up at that point, before even ordering, and left. This particular lady needs a class on customer service. This business is going to go downhill if this type of service continues. I would give zero stars if I could.",

    "text": "Big Wong is BIG on value. Though we missed the \"Dollar Dining,\" we are very happy to have discovered this place. Luckily, my parents saved the flyer and after seeing the prices on their menu, we asked, \"why not?\" We went there this past Sunday evening and met the owners Wai (or was it Wayne?) and Connie and their \"regulars\" Judd and Lynn. Luck would have it, we are all avid cruisers. Woo Hoo...one can never have too few cruising buddies!   Back to why we are here: the food. Big Wong's menu is limited to one page and some posted specials on the wall. After discussing the menu with Wai and Connie, their philosophy is to keep the menu simple and ensure their food is always consistent and at a reasonable price. Mission accomplished!   I had the Hainan Chicken and my wife had the Curry Chicken. The flavoring of the Hainan style chicken was delicate and tender. You dip the chicken into the accompanying chili sauce or soy/sesame oil sauce. The included seasoned rice was fluffy and also delicately seasoned. The chicken curry was wonderful and included potatoes, however, I like a little more \"kick\" in my curry. Spiciness is such a subjective matter and I understand you cannot please everyone. Some people may just complain that it is too spicy. You can't subtract spiciness, but you can always add. Connie also brought a sample of their beef stew and let me tell you, the beef was so tender and delicious! Both of our portions are satisfying and don't let the price fool you. You definitely get your money's worth here!   Looking forward to becoming regulars at Big Wong and try out their ramen and wontons.  Update 6/5/11-Since writing this review, we have been back two more times and today with my parents. I have had the Beef Ramen, Ribeye over Pasta, and my wife had the Shrimp Wontons twice. Big Wong's Beef Ramen is exquisite. They spend a lot of time preparing the bite-size chunks of beef and tendons by trimming out the fat and un-chewable membrane that you find in Chinese style beef stew. Every piece is satisfyingly tender. I asked Wai how is the broth prepared and he told me directly from the stew. Delicious and hearty. No MSG after taste here.  The wontons (immersed in a flavorful broth) are loaded with shrimp and no pork filler used here. The ribeye is also very tender and juicy (cooked medium) and comes with a pepper style gravy that you pour yourself and a sliced herbed potato.  6/17/11-Went to our first UYE here at Big Wongs. It was great to meet other Yelpers.  6/19/11-Wai has been telling me about his Dungeness Crab over rice noodles (horfun) special and I had to give it a try so we came back today. The fresh crab is steamed with ginger and served over the rice noodles with it's natural sweet crab juice. Simply delicious.",

The beef was really tender and juicy, the noodles perfect. The broth wasn't really strong enough for me, but good. I would have liked more condiments to add to it, instead of just onions and chilli sauce.The fried shrimp wantons were DIVINE, though. Absolute love at first bite!  The waitress was super sweet, taking her time to explain the menu to us, and always appearing whenever we needed something. The food was really inexpensive as well,  which I love.. Since I'm cheap.",

My friend was not impressed with the #1 either. I don't think there was a waiter or waitress either. The guy cooking (one of them) appeared to be doing both. Is that a health code violation??!! My hands have that greasy feeling....was the table not clean? I didn't eat with them. We were given plastic utensils. I simply won't come back. I didn't give it one star simply  because the food didn't make me sick. Spend your money where someone cares about their establishment is my advice!",

Didn't know what to expect but saw that the prices were affordable. I ordered the thin slices beef over rice! I was blown away by the flavor and wasn't expecting much considering the low price. The flavor of the beef and rice were tasty and it includes potatoes which was a tasteful delight.  I will come back here again!",

The hai nan chicken rice my mom ordered was nasty. The white meat was so tough? Whatever they did, even the dipping sauces didn't help. Fish porridge, it was pretty thick. Didn't look that appetizing. Overall, given the price of the food, it was ok, but I doubt I'd be coming back. Looking at the four star on yelp, I feel like I really got cheated. :( I had to give this a two star.   On another note, why do these food places ALWAYSSSSS forget my drink? Food #2 place that forgot my drink during my trip in vegas.",

I've tried majority of the menu, but I find myself almost always ordering the same thing these days, which is the deep fried chicken over rice. I haven't had anything bad to date.   I will get the Shrimp Won Tons, sauteed veggies Thai style, deep friend chicken over rice, and sweetened roti pancakes, but take most of it home.   I like their almond and mango pudding, but the mango is really sweet compared to their almond, which is expected, but be warned if you can't handle super sweet, stay away from the mango and go with the almond! The Sweetened Roti pancake is another good choice! It's only $1 while the pudding are $1.25 each.   Basically would recommend anything and everything on the menu! As the prices are pretty cheap too, don't be afraid to make this a regular spot!",

Everything was delicious. The gravy that came with my order was really good. Overall we paid $29.02 which is very reasonable for everything we ordered.

This is a super casual (read, not fancy), but very affordable restaurant in the Chinatown area. They have lots of choices, and everything we sampled was really tasty!  The chicken curry with roti was delicious. I could have eaten the roti by itself all day long, but the curry was no slouch either!  The shrimp wantons.. .Give me more!! Amazing!  The salt and pepper chicken wings.. You can't go too wrong with chicken wings, but these were great!  We also had the stir fried Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  As everyone else has said, the prices are VERY affordable, so you can try quite a lot without breaking the bank.",

I was craving noodle soup so I decided to try the Shrimp & Wonton Noodle soup. It was good, but it was a little bit salty. The bowl is a pretty decent size for what you pay for ($8.50 for the wonton noodle soup). Their service is decent, the person that took our order didn't really talk much but just took our orders. I think I'll come back next time but I want to try their rice dishes instead.",

    "text": "Pardon the novel, but after reading through many of the negative reviews, I decided I needed to write my own, because I've grown to love this place after feeling the same sort of way, as many of the less than 3 star reviews, in the beginning.  Here's the deal...the prices are amazing, the food is consistent and delicious, the portions are well beyond their prices, the service could be improved (from a new guest's standpoint) and no, they don't serve their drinks in fancy glasses or give you nice silverware. I'm a big fan of good food and a bigger fan of good food at a great price (this is not to say I don't enjoy my fancy meals, too). I don't care that I'm not drinking out of crystal...and for those of you that complain about the plastic forks...maybe you should learn to use chopsticks. :P  Yes, when my friend and I first started going, we were hesitant to think much of the place because it seems to be a crazy environment. However, after going time and time again, it's just how they work. They work morning through night with little help and still manage to keep the doors open. How many of you could do that day in and day out?? After building a rapport, I see the kind and humorous side in Connie (the lady that we all know) and Paul (the guy with the \"fluffy chef's hat\" ). Even the guy who gets louder (whose name I don't know) can have a softer side when he's not going crazy with orders.  No, we don't always have our water refilled, yes, the orders sometimes do take long to even be taken, and we used to comment among ourselves, but this place has become a staple for us to dine in during our lunch break. We gave it time, not just one...or even three times...but more because the food/prices kept us coming back. But each time you go, you understand the dynamic more and learn to appreciate, or even find the humor in it.  Many of the negative reviews are regarding their service standards and that some of their dishes being bland. One of the main dishes that I noticed people commenting on is the Hoi Nam chicken, better known as Singaporean Hainanese chicken. The chicken is meant to be prepared that way (bland) with sauces to accompany. And that sauce that goes along with...delicious! Do I like the dish? Let's just say that I don't hate it, but it's not something I would typically order for the very same reason that many of you have commented. But this does NOT mean that all foods are created equal.  But, I do recommend some of the following dishes as they are also our go-to's:  Salt and pepper chicken wings - they're crispy, salty and the addition of the jalapenos (usually) pack a good amount of punch!  Salt and pepper pork chop - same as the chicken wings in flavor - 99% of the time, it's been the most moist pork I've ever had  Thin rib eye - yes, it's fatty but some people like that; yes, it's served with potatoes and it seems odd; no, it doesn't seem like Asian food - how many of you like Asian food but have partners or friends that don't? Well, then maybe that will answer your question as to why this is on their menu...  Curry Chicken - you need to realize that this isn't your typical Thai or Indian curry chicken, it's Malaysian, and yes, it tastes different than what you're used to, and that's amazing - stop comparing apples to oranges  Chicken with mushroom and Chinese sausage - this dish takes a long time to prepare, so be warned, but it's worth it; the chicken is tender, the broth is rich, and Chinese sausage as well as some veggies are just served on the side. The veggies have no seasoning, but it's meant to be dipped into the broth. (In fact, I left during this review to eat there and had it.)  Steamed fish filet - we got this only because we saw it on the new picture menu on the wall and again, without the sauce, it would be bland, BUT it's tender and delicious with the ginger soy sauce. I've ordered it twice, now.  So, for those of you that gave negative reviews...I suggest you give it another shot and get something you know will be good. For those of you that haven't tried, go with the S&P wings and/or pork chop and Steamed chicken and mushroom w/Chinese sausage. Though, I'm sure some of you will still be tough to please.",

Located in Chinatown, this place is mixed into a shopping plaza with Monta Ramen and Kung Fu Tea.   Service: thought it could have been better. Although the lady provided the basic service- I thought it was a bit aggressive and non welcoming. We asked for extra sauce and even though we got it without any complaints- she seemed annoyed. Just a basic smile and or a \"no problem\" would have been nice.   Food: Again, very basic. It's good but nothing worth raving about. These are dishes that I can do and I think my haianese chicken tastes better. No offense. Theirs was very bland and you do need some sauce to make it tasty! The curry chicken with roti was a bit on the salty side but the rotis were very nice! Freshly made.   Price: very descent and the portion was huge for the price point. Good for a quick fix meal.",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a try based on a good friend's love of it, and wanting to try a new place. The shrimp wonton noodle soup, as previously reviewed, was VERY good. I actually added a bit of soy sauce to it as I thought it a bit bland, and I rarely have that problem, but still give it 5 stars.   The 3-star review is for the fact that they gave us BURNT chicken wings. Burnt. As in my husband picked up one of the pieces and said \"What is that?\" And he's one of those people that don't mind if something's slightly burned. He calls them the \"toastier version.\" He said the flavor was good enough where he didn't mind the fact that they. Were. BURNT! We got the chicken wings based on the photos we saw on Yelp and nope, ours didn't look like those at all.  We got our order to-go, and while I hate to think it, I feel like they purposely gave us the burnt order as they knew it wouldn't \"fly\" if they were to serve it to someone dining at the restaurant. It's like they knew or hoped that we wouldn't bother to drive back to ask for another order.  In spite of the wing incident, we'll go back, because the wonton soup is damn good. We'll most likely order it to-go again, but I'm gonna make darn sure I check the food before leaving the premises!",

Once we walked in, the establishment was nearly empty and a cashier looked tired, yawning at our presence. It was 7:30pm, really?  We were seated and our menu was brought to us. It had no pictures but pictures of the food were on the wall. My parents don't speak or read Chinese or English so it was difficult for them to convey what they wanted to eat. After about 15 minutes, after going through and explaining what was available, we ordered about 4-5 dishes to try.   The waitor came to give us our drinks then the next half hour in 5 minute intervals, they brought out the food. Everything was just ok. Some items weren't seasoned well or didn't have the flavors we were expecting. The shrimp wonton soup was the most delicious item we had that night. It was flavorful and hot, cooked to perfection.   Overall, it's a nice place to try but my parents thought it was the worst meal we had in Vegas because everything was so bland. Our drinks (just ice water) wasn't refilled and the waitor wasn't attentive. We left disappointed. May give it a try again but more than likely not. There are so many other places to eat in Vegas.",

Not long after being there the whole place got pretty packed. When I saw Chef Sheridan of Fat Choy and Flock n Fowl come in and sit at the table next to us with his family I knew we came to a good place.  Price and portions are GREAT!! Average price for most dishes were about $5-7 for most. Hopefully they don't try to raise their prices up like other restaurants do after it starts getting busy. I remember when Asian BBQ and noodle was that cheap when they first opened but their prices started rising not long after. Bummer.  Boneless dark meat Hainan Chicken - delicious! Chicken was nice and moist. Rice was slightly seasoned. Both dips were good and portion was big enough to share for $4.95.   Crispy Shrimp Fried Wontons - Amazeballs!! Light crispy perfectly seasoned goodness   Wonton noodle - Good could add more seasoning to your likings   Curry Roti - Loved the buttery crispy Roti!! Curry could use some salt tho lol  Ribs in black bean sauce - bland nothing special pass on this   Sweet Roti Dessert! Delish!! Better than most Thai restaurants   I will be back again very very soon!! I really can't stop thinking about those damn fried wontons!! Already have other items on the menu I want to try next",

For one, the food is not drenched in oil or extremely salty... everything has a unique flavor I can't say I find in any other Chinese place. Everything is extremely reasonably priced as well!   TO START: Get the SHRIMP WONTONS. Fried to a perfect crisp, these babies are so flavorful. I can't put my finger on it, but they are just so addicting. One order comes with 10 pieces, are a good size and comes with a light sweet n' sour sauce. Do it!  FOR HER: I swear by their HOUSE SPECIAL SHRIMP WONTON WITH NOODLE SOUP. The soup is a broth that is not too salty but so savory. Comes with thin noodles, Chinese broccoli and steamed shrimp wontons. So extremely satisfying every time!   FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF RAMEN WITH TENDON. The beef was so tender and was seasoned perfectly, and the soup again was not too salty but absolutely perfect. Not a fan of tendon texture, but he ate everything and said it was all so good!  TO FINISH: We tried the ALMOND PUDDING just to get a little sweet fix. A small cup portion, but it wasn't too sugary! It almost had a tinge of fruit flavor I couldn't figure it out until the end... when I found a lychee hidden inside! My favorite fruit ever, so it was the cherry on top to a great meal! :)",

It's great when you don't want to eat anything heavy or if you have a cold. The wings are crispy and not too spicy.   Price: so cheap! $5.50 can't be beat!  Service: same guy is always here and returns my smile!  Location: same plaza as Kung Fu tea and Zen Curry so parking can be challenging at times.",

Luckily I wanted to try their Hoi Nam Chicken (white meat, deboned) over rice and was available! Even though the chicken and rice wasn't made-to-order, it still tasted good (lol)! Their seasoned rice was very good. The chicken was a bit overcooked though it came with sweet (i believe) soy sauce which made it better. Have to definitely come back to tryout the rest of their yummy looking cheap/big portion size menu!",

I have a deep appreciation for this restaurant as it shares the same last name as me so I held it to very high expectations.   The place inside definitely reminds you of a \"cheap\" Chinese restaurant as it is pretty basic inside and they use styrofoam cups for water and plastic utensils. They actually just got new menus and some new pictures on the wall I think. Passing the savings on to the consumer? I am all for it. One small thing is that the prices have increased on their menu over the past year or so.   All in all, you can never go wrong with their hainam chicken or soup noodles especially for the price! (~$6) I wouldn't come in here expecting even a four star quality meal but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. I recommend getting the dark meat with the rice since it's a lot more tender than the white meat and not typical dark meat in chicken. Also the stir fried veggies always smell SO good when it comes out on the sizzling platter and the smell permeates of garlic throughout the restaurant. I always gotta stop by BIG WONG'S when I am in town!",

    "text": "So I was looking at Chinese food in Las Vegas, and this was the first one that popped up. Okay yeah sure leggo try it.  It was a big and very wong mistake to do so.  Came in before leaving to go back to the LA area and had a lunch here. I looked at the empty place and I was like ummmmm. okay. I see 4 stars and this is close to Kung Fu Tea so we'll stay and try it.  I ordered #8- roti with a curry that included chicken and potatoes. I forget the name of the dish but that's what I remember eating.  The positives here are that the roti (similar to a green onion pancake) was decent. It had the bread taste. The potatoes- the curry supplied all the flavor. When you bit inside and ate inside, you got absolutely zippo taste. Nothing, Nada. Zilch. It was bland. The chicken was a bit better, because it was soft, and it was in strips so the curry could actually soak into the chicken, but wasn't too impressed. Curry was watered down. A lot.  Had one shrimp wonton because there were many reviews about it. You can taste the shrimp but it was just missing some flavor to the point of being decent.  The reason why Big Wong is popular is because of them having really cheap prices. Which they do. Shrimp wonton is $4.95, and most of the prices do go along that route. The food comes out in a timely manner and service comes quickly.   so here's my tl;dr: You get what you pay for.",

I had the fried chicken with noddles and I wasn't a fan of the noodles simply because there wasn't too much flavor but I do understand that in China and Japan they don't have really flavorful broth so I expected it.

The Hoi Nam chicken with rice, on the other hand, was a tad bit dry.  The rice was delicious though.  Maybe because we got the white meat??? Either way, I will give dark meat a try next time.  Pork Chop over rice...the main star for us, however, is the egg.  How did  the chef got the yolk of the hard boiled egg to be soft and fluffy beats me...it was definitely interesting in the good way.  The pork chop tasted good with that gravy that accompanied it.  Beef ramen was actually tasty.  I am not a big fan of beef, but I thought it was season nicely, with tender tendon and beef brisket.  There was a lot of noodles in there too.  We got really full.

    "text": "We couldn't resist Big Wong's Grand Opening special - Purchase $1 beverage and get your meal free!  We were concerned with how packed this place would be during their opening week, but we easily got a table with no wait.  Lucky us...the news was just spreading!  What surprised us most was the pleasant and welcoming reception we received when we walked in.  Yes, it may have had to do with the non-Asian face smiling at us as we walked in, but it definitely gave us a different impression of how our meal was going to be.  Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.  I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.  The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.    We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.  This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.  The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)  When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that!   Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!  3.5 stars.",

(#5-6b) It does take 15 mins to make so i warn you if your super hungry and are super impatient, but it is 100% worth the wait. This is my 100% go to because the fried chicken tastes so freaking good with the gravy that comes with the plate...ask for extra gravy sauce because its that delicious. (I always get #5 because i like dark meat)  I've tried almost everything on the menu from the hoi nam chicken, shrimp wonton noodle soup, and the salt and pepper chicken wings. I ALWAYS go for seasoned rice as well. This is the place if your on a budget and its good portion size.",

The interior of the restaurant was bright and clean with tables spaced out evenly without an overcrowded feeling.   The items on the menu all looked really tasty including Hainan chicken (with the choice of white or dark meat), fried chicken cutlet and udon, shrimp and wonton noodle soup (and it comes in a spicy version too!), fried wontons (it looks delish), chicken curry and roti (i ordered this one, i love roti!), and taiwanese beef noodle.  Most of all, can't really beat the price here, most items are only $5.95-7.80.  So you can easily sample a couple of items at the price tag of one in most other places.  Bottle and soft drinks are only $1.  I'll definitely recommend it to friends who's looking for a good bowl of noodle and wontons.",

    "text": "Not bad Big Wong. I was able to satisfy my appetite under $5 bucks and wasn't disappoint. That goes without saying that it really wasn't anything spectacular.   So I got the Special Shrimp Soup and added shrimp wontons for an over-the-top shrimpy meal. The food came out fast and my first impression was the broth was pretty shrimpy w/ a little bit of spice to it. It also contained udon noodles and chopped Chinese broccoli.   Coming in, I was starving and at the end I didn't even finish all my noodles. So don't be fooled! The portion size is deceiving because of all the substance they throw into the bowl.   On the minus side, they serve their drinks in styrofoam cups. And that's something I'll always frown upon. I guess it's cheap but couldn't you save more with washable plastic cups? C'mon guys.   Service was abrupt but attentive. The restaurant was arranged to sit groups of up to 6-8 people.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I'll be back w/ friends to try more of the menu.",

If it were not for Yelp recommendations, I probably would have never gone to this restaurant.  Looking through the menu, most of the items are under $5.00... my college fund definitely goes a long way in this place!!  I decided to try out their hainanese chicken since that is what the restaurant is mainly known for.  Being it my first time having such dish, I thought it was actually quite delicious!  The chicken breast was really tender due to the method of how it was cooked; also, the condiments (hoisin and chili sauce) add a great taste to the dish.  Also tried their chicken curry with roti and a fried pork dish... but thought I would rather get those elsewhere.  Overall experience? Big Wong Restaurant is a great place for lunch due to their affordable prices but definitely do not walk into this place with high expectations--YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR.  I actually like how the restaurant crews were yelling at each other half the time I was there since it makes the experience more authentic.  I will definitely be back!",

Not flavorful at all. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong things but I doubt I'd give it another try. There are too many places in Vegas to eat good Chinese/Taiwanese food. This isn't one of them.   I had their chicken special which was boneless chicken over their \"special\" rice. There was nothing special about the rice - it was just rice. Chicken was boiled chicken. If I was sick and needed bland, flavorless food, this would have hit the spot.   Also got the salt and pepper chicken wings. Neither salty nor peppery and I felt the wings were kind of burnt.   Also got the wonton soup. So very bland.   Did I mention the food was bland?",

Chinese food craving kicked in big time one night, there was no way that i was returning to (I will not mention the name of the other chinese establishment, just scroll through my reviews) but I was not going back. So I get on my YELP app and look up cheap ($) chinese food (don't judge me) BIG WONG'S pops up.  I'm all about supporting the local family owned business.  I rate 3STARS for one reason only...the SHRIMP WONTONS, um DELISH yea!  It's nothing super fancy, very simple item.  I came across this item by default, I actually walked in for a killer egg roll but this restaurant does not sell EGG ROLLS.  and the lady looked at me like I had 2 heads and I asked for egg rolls. \"I'm sorry lady, my mistake, I thought all Chinese Food restaurant serve egg rolls, they do in California.\"  Ok, I'm getting sidetracked here.....so no egg rolls but she suggested that I tried their Shrimp Wontons instead...   -Shrimp - Wonton Wrappers - Deep Fried Goodness - served w/ a sweet and sour chili sauce.  all for $4.95 - 8pcs  Crispy, not soggy or saturated w/ oil.  Made to order, I always do take out, they are sealed in a foil heat bag to keep them warm and crunchy.    This is so a MOM and POP joint, no fancy digs here.  I have never tried anything else on the menu because it does not appeal to me, I go there for one thing and one thing ONLY!!! SHRIMP WONTONS (simple deliciousness)  Try it out, you might find something other than SHRIMP WONTONS on that menu that you might like  -ENJOY ;-)",

I ordered the famous Hainan chicken rice, and my friend ordered the chicken curry. We also got an order of the roti and chinese broccoli to share. The Hainan chicken rice was...mediocre. I really wanted it to be amazing. The chicken was OK. It wasn't quite a moist and silky as I was hoping. The rice could have been a bit more fragrant. I know I can't really be that picky when it comes to Hainanese Chicken rice as there aren't too many options. The chicken curry was flavorful, but would have liked it to be a bit spicier (or spicy at all). Finally, we ordered the stir fried chinese broccoli that came on a hot place. It was actually my favorite part, but they did leave some of the tougher parts of the veggie, and I personally don't like that part of the vegetable, but for the most part, the Chinese broccoli was nice and crisp.",

So I turn to Big Wong for a good/cheap meal after an expensive night out.  $4.95 for hanan chicken  $0.75 for a bowl of broth (perfect remedy for a hangover) $3.75 for a bowl of bomb vegetables  I love coming here on my frequent visits to Vegas. Helps cut the cost for my trips. and the service is really good! The lady working there is always attending to the customers. Definitely a nice family business.",

The Shrimp Wontons were great! Crunchy and the flavor was bold but not over bearing. Now for the greatest part, the price is hard to beat, $5.50 for most items. My wife and I had two appetizers and two entrees and with a $5.00 tip our bill was still only $30.00",

Not sure why such a popular restaurant would not get extra staff during the holidays but there were only two people doing the cash register, bussing the tables, and serving food in a restaurant that was completely packed and with a line waiting at the door.   The woman who normally is the only person in there started getting frustrated and had a sullen mood as people began to complain.   Good food for cheap but I would never go during the holidays.   While I doubt my complaints on their service will not matter as people will still go here for cheap, delicious food-- to me, they would be earning more money if they could serve people faster and get them out the door with 1 or 2 more waiters.",

It comes with rice with a spicy sauce and a soy sauce base. The chicken (I got the white meat) was fresh and made so well I just wanted to get more.

Ordered a bunch of things on the menu including the Hainan chicken and rice, braised beef, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed fish fillet, and wonton soup, as well as various stir fried veggies.  The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge.   The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food! So we asked for more rice, which was brought over in a huff and slammed on our table. Kind of made for a tense dining experience, if you ask me.  Might be worth it if you love hole-in-the-wall joints like this and have thick skin to boot!",

    "text": "With so many stellar dining options available to one in Chinatown, it's very easy to gloss over some of the seemingly nondescript restaurants such as Big Wong. But you'd be making a mistake by glossing this place over -- what it lacks in flash decor and well-known dishes it more than makes up for with its inexpensive but delicious food, proving that sometimes simplicity is the way to go.  Big Wong can be found in the same plaza as Sweets Raku, Abriya Raku, Monta Ramen, and Japanese Curry Zen -- all amazing restaurants with their own following, as my previous reviews on Sweets Raku and Curry Zen can attest to. This is probably why when you come in, Big Wong is not so overly busy. But again, their food is spectacular!  Big Wong is well-known for its Asian street fare -- Hainan chicken rice, chicken curry with roti, salt and pepper wings, and noodle soups are among the cheap but delicious fare on offer. I ordered the Hainan chicken rice and stir-fried Chinese broccoli for my meal.  Everything tends to come out fairly quickly, and with generous portions to boot -- which is great for sharing, but not so much if you're by yourself. ( On the upside: leftovers! ) The Hainan chicken rice comes out with two sauces: a soy sauce base and a spicy one that both work really well with the chicken. The chicken itself can be bland at times, but the dish does a good job of highlighting the chicken by itself. The Chinese broccoli was stir-fried perfectly, coated in a fragrant mix of garlic and oyster sauce that can be admittedly difficult to eat with the plastic utensils they use here.  For the price point, the food at Big Wong is surprisingly very good and very filling. Of course, there are some dishes that could be better, but overall this restaurant is a very good place to go if you're running low on cash -- or if you want something cheap and filling. It's little wonder that Big Wong is one of my personal favorite places in a block known for its more luxuriant offerings -- but don't take my word for it! Come out for yourself and taste why sometimes simple is best.",

So go to Big Wong after some walking in the strip and did not want to eat too much while it was late.  I had the shrimp Won Ton noodle soup and my other half had the Won ton fun which was flat rice noodle.  The shrimp won ton was very good, there was a whole shrimp in there, altogether there were five won ton in one bowl.  The noodle was over cooked and too soft which is perfect for old people.  The broth was just OK.  Price was cheap only 6.5 plus tax. The old man who had a kitchen hat who I assume was the owner was grumpy755 W Garvey Ave, Monterey Park, CA 91754 and did not  want you be there.  When I left I said thank you he did not respond.  They have attitude to customer who came too late so you better do not go there after 10pm.  It was Thanksgiving after all so I did not take this into consideration while making the rating.",

So we found a ramen place on Yelp in this plaza and drove the 5 minutes off the Strip to get here. The waiting for seats was about 45 minutes there so we had to find a faster way to get soup. Big Wong next door looked good and had plenty of seats open, they even have newspaper excerpts in the window, so you get the idea they are famous and what some popular dishes are before you even go in. So we were confident to order one noodle soup with breaded pork and one with chicken. The soup was oddly flavorless and bland and the chicken was just a ton of boiled chicken on the side. Again, with no flavor or any kind of spices. The pork was good, but nothing special there either, just salty, breaded pork. Service was fast and polite, but our soups had a lack of flavor or sophistication of any kind, try something else.",

The beef was cooked well but the tendon was lacking flavor. The whole dish was lack of flavor. My friend ordered the Hainan Chicken, which was also flavorless. Nothing really bad, but neither did anything stand out. It's a good place if you just want to have some cheap Chinese food.",

    "text": "Yelpers, rarely did you let me down...  I was excited about this place after reading the reviews, and even patiently waited for a parking space to open up in order to eat here...  Hainan chicken rice:  tasted like the chicken was just boiled in water, rather than with lots of aromatics.  The soy sauce was not the dark/thick kind, and the chili sauce was blah.  This was a huge letdown.  beef noodle:  not bad, good portion and flavor  chicken curry rice:  not bad, but tasted like butter chicken you can get at Costco  fried pork chop over rice:  was expecting crispy batter, but it was...like stewed?  I think it was fried and then dumped in sauce.  The accompanying dipping sauce was also a \"meh.\"  Service was friendly but haphazard...one waiter was serving the entire restaurant (owner was cashier/kitchen helper/waiter), and one guy was the main chef I believe.  For our party of 4, two people nearly finished their food before the last two dishes showed up.  When I waved at the owner to inquire about our 4th dish, he just waved back dismissively.  Well at least we got our food.  Overheard two customers got their take-out orders wrong,    Price:  inexpensive, but I realized that this is truly what you pay is what you get.  Of all the restaurants in LV Chinatown, I am disappointed that Yelp pointed me to this.  Advice to owner:  it's okay to raise the price a bit (people who choose to come to Vegas usually come with a full wallet), and hire an extra helper, and increase the quality of your dish, cut down the menu a bit to focus on quality rather than quantity.  You will have many more satisfied customers.",

My bf and I ordered things mostly recommended on Yelp, the Hainan chicken, wonton soup, chicken curry with roti, salt and pepper wings, sweet roti, and almond pudding. The food came out quickly and was hot, however all the utensils were plastic which really threw me off. My bf described the Hainan chicken as really bland, wonton soup broth was also bland but the actual wonton was good because there was a whole shrimp in each one. Chicken curry and salt and pepper wings were average, and the sweet roti and almond pudding were pretty good. Service was excellent as everyone in the restaurant was very quick, attentive, and friendly.",

    "text": "I want to give this place four stars, but based on service and what we ordered, I felt it was a bit of an injustice.   First off, we decided to come here based on the idea that it was cheap, had great reviews, looked good and was far from the strip (I.e. We'd get a table fast and wouldn't break the bank for brunch).  Walked in at about 1p and there were about two or three tables with customers, so we asked if we could sit at a larger table bc we planned on ordering a lot. The person who seated us said they were busy and couldn't do that, but we ended up getting a regular four person table (since there were two person ones too). What? That was such a bizarre comment to me.   Upon ordering, the waitress/employee rushed us through and was SUPER Chinese about it which means, she was pretty rude. We had a couple of questions and everything we asked was answers in haste and with attitude. But I mean, I guess we have to expect that a Chinese place would be that way. It's all good.   We decided not to get too much and we were glad.  Our items: Fried porkchop  Fried chicken wings Bokchoy Rice  The porkchop was quite juicy, almost as if it wasn't cooked enough (soft soft texture). It wasn't crispy at all, but in general, it had a good flavor. I decided against eating it because it was too pink and too soft for my liking. It came with rice and a marinated egg, though - good stuff.   The chicken wings were the best thing on our menu. They were super crispy, but really oily and very salty. The jalapenos in it were a good touch. It was also the most expensive part of the meal, which is weird.   Bokchoy: good, as expected. They ran out of ong choy (water spinach), so we opted for this veggie. Good, but not mind blowing.   Rice: so old, not fresh, and we had to pay extra for it! Blah. I hate places that charge for rice because it really doesn't cost that much to make and to supply it! Darn you, 21st century capitalists!  Prices are darn cheap, though, so that was a huge plus. It ended up being $20 after tax and tip.   Parking is plentiful - there's a shared lot for the businesses, but if that gets to be a cluster, park on the street, you'll be fine.   I don't mind going back to this place, but I'm not sold on the food. Maybe if we get better things next time, I'll consider the change in rating.",

The only reason I can think of why this place has a decent amount of good ratings is the food proportion to the price. They give you a lot of chicken for like $7. The downside? You trade it for poor service and bland food. The chicken had no taste. The fried version of the chicken plate was no good as well. Tasted like you were eating flour. I would choose lollicup or tapex fried chicken over this.   It took a long time for the waiters to provide us menus for us to order, and when we ordered, they didn't serve the last person in our group until we were all about half done with our food. She was one of the first to order. When we were all finished eating, we were unable to waive a server down to get us our bill. Had to pay up front.  I wouldn't recommend this place to any friends.",

They brought me the wrong dish at first and when I told him it was incorrect, he made some comment under his breath and when I said, \"What?\" he waved his hand and took the food away. The wonton noodle soup wasn't that great.  Overall, all the food was just very average but the service puts it at a 2. I don't mind horrible service at hole-in-the-walls when the food is spectacular, but when the food is super average AND the service sucks? No thanks, I'll take my business elsewhere.",

    "text": "I like coming to Big Wong because the food is cheap for its quality and taste. I usually get the #1 Hoi Nam chicken (white meat) for $5.50, which I recommend. The dark meat is better taste wise but white meat obviously healthier. The yellow rice is very good (not greasy at all) and remember to use the sauce. The waiter recommended the #15 Beef Tendon Ramen, which I thought was average. The broth was OK, the noodles itself were generic. The brisket was good and tender but the tendon pieces were too rough and hard to be edible.   If you like authentic Chinese food with a little twist (not much though) and are on a strict budget, come to Big Wong. Note there seems to be 1-2 people working there who handle everything (counter, cashier, serving, etc) and can get slammed and overwhelmed at busy times",

Thoughts: A side from the cheap price in food, I don't know how this place would get a 4.5 star rating.  Do not order congee. As all 5 members in my group did and were very disappointed.  Then again it was mid-summer in Las Vegas with 114 degree who would want to have congee in such hot weather?  The congee were  terrible, as some of the rice was sticking like a lump of melted coal with very little for topping in the soup. It could be mid-day, so they might not have a fresh pot of congee, but avoid ordering if possible.   I had ordered the traditional wonton noodle soup. The soup was like warm and very bland even for me, leaving displeasured for our 1st meal in Las Vegas. Each dish was approx $5 dollars, so it was super cheap but disappointing.   Service was also very slow and poor. I would not go back, unless you lost all your $ in gambling and need a cheap meal.",

I ordered the salt and pepper pork chop. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was soft and doused in some sauce (soy?). I wouldn't get it again.  If you're looking for something quick and cheap and you're in the area, this is fine. Otherwise I'd skip it.",

However, what you can expect is a super delicious home cooked meal, for a very low price.  The service was good, but a little slow because they are obviously understaffed.  All the items we ordered are $8 and below.  The portion is quite large, and we were stuffed.  We ordered fried salt and peppered chicken. ong choy, 4 bowls of wonton noodle soup with fish balls, and 1 Haoi nam chicken that came with a side of vegetables and steamed chicken.  All the food were delicious.  If you are on a budget or craving for a home cooked meal, this is definitely the right place for you.  Don't be shocked that your  water does come in styro foams cups though, but hey at least you know that your mouth is the only one that has touched it.",

Not always easy to find over here. Heard the spicy wings were great and they were! Perfectly done! Had a huge punch. Had to get something my picky son would eat and he likes curry so got him chicken curry with rice. It was good just like how my mom would've made it. Homey and a bit too much potatoes. I am not a huge fan of Hunan chicken but it's not easy to find a good one so I wanted to introduce that to the rest of the family. This one was done perfectly and they liked it. My fishball loving son of course loved the soup. It was actually recommended my the waitress/owner? Since they ran out of porridge :( the soup base and noodles were great and the shrimp wontons were one of the best we have had. My kids loved noodles so we got another soup noodle dish, beef tendon. It was fatty but tasty.  We enjoyed it all a lot despite it being a very small place and even though our family was large she sat us by ourselves but the tables were very near so it didn't feel that comfortable but hey we came here to eat. Water tasted fine and restrooms weren't that dirty. But yes it seemed like she's the only one working there but still the food came out quick. She seemed very busy and a bit stressed and absentminded but still got our orders and dishes as prompt as possible. Felt a tad bad for her lol The price was reasonable even though the dishes weren't that big. But we just had a huge lunch buffet so if it wasn't for that we may had to order some more.  This was a fun find. I loved it most because I knew how these dishes were supposed to taste and they were on point. May try out other places next time we are in town but this was good :)  Located in Chinatown and after headed straight to kungfu tea for a sweet fix ;) Worth the trip away from the strip.",

I tried the beef ramen, salt and pepper wings and the roti dessert pancake. The ramen was good, the wings were great, and I'm definitely coming back for more dessert roti. The other people dining with me loved the shrimp wonton soup and curried chicken. Everyone was full and happy by the time we left Big Wong's.  This place has a very casual ambiance, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if plastic cutlery isn't your style, this place might not be for you.  The parking, however, is terrible. Just thinking about trying to find parking on a weekend in the lot in front of Big Wong's is enough to give me a panic attack. So many aggressive, hungry drivers, and WAY too few spots. That's the only True downside of Big Wong's.",

    "text": "Big Wing prices, first off, are insanely good; especially for the plaza that they're in.  Situated next to Raku and Monta, parking will be impossible.   Now to the review. Big Wong specializes in regional cuisine, as such the menu is limited. Though it looks long upon first sight, most Re just renditions of the same chicken or fish dish and then a different sauce, cooking style, etc.   We ordered the basic white meat chicken, salt and pepper fish, and baby Bok Choy stir fried. The chicken was very basic considering it was their regional specialty. The salt and pepper fish came deep fried (unexpected) but was remarkably good, especially dipped in one of he provided spicy sauces. The Bok Choy was relatively basic taste wise but cooked to perfection.   All in all the food came out quickly, the prices were great, and the experience went well. A downside is no alcohol, but for a quick meal at a good price I think you can handle it.",

    "text": "Big Wong has the perfect Vegas meal for anybody on a budget who might not have struck it rich with lady luck. Their amazing menu has most items for around $5. This is the type of hole-in-the-wall that Bourdain would rave about. How cheap is this place? Even their hot tea is served in styrofoam cups. The fried chicken aside, most of their dishes don't classify as \"greasy Chinese food.\" Here are some of my favorites:  - Hoi nam (Hainan) chicken over rice: This is one of my favorites. The seasoned rice is the bee's knees. It comes in three variations: white meat, dark meat, and bone-in dark meat.  - Special deep fried chicken over rice: This rice isn't seasoned, but it does come with a pretty tasty sauce. The fried chicken is more flavorful than the steeped Hainan chicken, but also more greasy. I like the dark meat version of this dish.  - Curry chicken served with (3) roti pancakes: The roti pancakes are amazing. A great curry dish if you're craving something more Malaysian.   - Beef ramen: This is possibly the most underrated dish on the entire menu. The eggs are perfectly soft-boiled and I love the beef. Each piece is super tender and probably braised for a long time.   - Salt and pepper chicken wings: Perfectly fried and a great appetizer or side to share with the table.    You really can't go wrong with any of these dishes. Order a couple of dishes if you're paying with a credit card - the minimum charge is $10.",

But the curry beef is just soso. Oh yeah we also ordered the fried shrimp wonton and it's really gooood :) ! A must have if you go there !!  Aside from the stem crab rice noodles, the other dishes are pretty cheap and also the person who served us ( i think she's the owner ) is really nice :))))  I gave this restaurant a 2 stars when i first went there since they really disappointed me. But  im giving them one more since they really improve a lot :) !!",

If you are like me and find those prices outrageous for very average tasting food, then head a couple miles to Big Wong's on Spring Mountain Road!  Everything is under $10, with most items under $6.  I enjoyed a late lunch with my family here & we ordered a couple Shrimp wonton noodle soups, one spicy shrimp wonton soup, the salt & pepper chicken, the salt & pepper shrimp, chicken curry roti, and the hainan boneless chicken with seasoned rice.  The food was excellent all around but the broth in the spicy shrimp soup was the best I've had in a long time!    One thing to note - the roti bread that comes with the chicken curry is not the typical South Asian variety you find at an Indian restaurant.  Rather, it is a flaky sesame \"bing\" (Chinese pancake) - the type you can buy frozen from the Asian market for $1.  Still very good, just FYI.  Next time, I'm going to try the soy sauce chicken. The table next to ours ordered it just before we finished our meal and it looked delicious!",

Speaking of Paul, he provided incredibly personalized service. His recommendations, friendliness, and attentiveness were top-notch.

But we don't go to restaurants for the service we go for the food, and basing this solely on that, it is excellent. My partner and I had just gotten massages at the foot spa down the street and had planned this meal in advance. We got there around 2:30/3:00 on Jan 2, and were seated immediately. I ordered the hot tea with lemon, and my partner also wanted that, but said hot tea and his was different. The HTwL is slightly sweetened the HT is not. We both got the house special shrimp wonton soup no noodles (my absolutely favorite thing right now) which is heavy on the shrimp, I got the salt and pepper pork (omg wow) and he got the chicken and mushroom with rice (super tasty). Everything was absolutely delicious. Took forever to get a to go container and the check. It was basically us sitting and playing on our phones for like 10 to 15 minutes waiting for attention. But again, food was excellent. We decided we are most likely going to use this place for delicious take out rather than dine in. Oh the best part...the prices were AMAZING for what you get. Will definitely be coming back.",

The soup had no flavor and wonton wasn't great it tasted frozen not freshly made.  The chicken wings were ordinary wings I could get anywhere else.

The workers are so happy and welcoming to any customer that walks through the door, the food is prepared with bountiful ladles of love, and the prices are definitely budget-friendly. A perfect place to eat alone or with family and friends.   The menu itself is small, with new menu items displayed on the walls. I noticed that there was only one vegetable dish: Fresh Vegetables in Oyster Sauce ($3.95), but I have a feeling if you have a hankering for something non-Oystery (?!?), they will be more than happy to whip something up for you that's not on the menu.   I ordered one of the new menu items: the Fried Shrimp Wontons (10 for $4.95)- Large pieces of shrimp only lovingly wrapped in delicate wonton wrappers, and then deep fried to crunchy perfection. Served with a sweet & sour sauce. Delicious! I would order this again!  I also tried some of the Chicken Curry and Roti, which was yummy. The curry was spicy and full of hearty potatoes and quality chicken. The roti was both crispy and chewy, and was the perfect dipping tool for the curry.   The atmosphere is casual. After you're done eating, you pay up front, so splitting the bill is quite easy. I'll be back!",

The first time I had the Hainan chicken and the shrimp won tons with ramen  The hainan chicken and the dipping sauce was  solid and the rice was flavorful.            Shrimp won ton ramen was tasty, the won tons had whole pieces of shrimp inside. I know some people rave about this but I prefer a  minced shrimp filling with water chestnuts , green onions etc.  The broth was clear and flavorful , the ramen was cooked perfectly.                              My second trip ordered the crispy pork chop, but got the crispy chicken instead, no problem I can adapt. The problem was the chicken lacked flavor and the dipping sauce was the pan drippings and was not very good.   I also had the beef curry  with rice and no tendons,  ,glad they asked  if I wanted tendon's given choice I rather eat meat then tendons.  I'll eat tendons if I'm still hungry and its the only thing left on my plate.              The beef curry was very good and more then made up for the crispy chicken.  I rate the food a very solid  3 stars and with the great service and super value it gets another star . Big Wong you get a 4 star review , thank you I will be back!!",

    "text": "I came for the \" Little Big Trouble\" UYE.   The special was 2 for 1 Beef Ramen so I partnered up with Paolo to grab the deal. The whole thing was a cross of different kinda of soups- between a pho soup and oxtail soup with ramen noodles. The meat and tendon (you can ask with or without) was plentiful and tender so it was stewed long enough. Ramen noodles was quite a lot (more than Monta next door) and had good bite. Soup base was clear and clean broth, but that meant to me I needed to dress it up a bit with green onion, soy sauce, hot sauce to suit my taste. I was hungry since I didn't have lunch and this was super filling.   Some people came at different times so we just kinda sat and hung out for hours. By the time people were trickling out the BF was there off work so it was dinner time.   We shared-  Deep Fried Pork Chop (asked crispy)- Pretty good meat and I like the gravy sauce they give you and the soy boiled egg.   Thin Sliced Ribeye- it was tender meat with a bit of fat on it so it's not for the lean beef sliced people. C'mon- it's ribeye. This also came with the gravy sauce and I think it went even better with the ribeye than the chop.   Chicken curry w/ roti- the curry had good flavor and had a good sized piece of chicken (bone in) and potato. The roti was light, flaky and very hot so it's made to order. This was both my BF and my favorite and I will definitely grab this again.   I had lunch here (about $3 for my half of the 2 for 1), dinner here and the BF had dinner here ($16 for 3 plates and 2 drinks).  I spent about $25 total with tax and tip....that's crazy! Food ranges from $4.95- $8max so its cheap and filling.   The service here was friendly and good. We were checked on, water cups were filled often. We weren't rushed out even though we were there for hours on end and I really want to give a shoutout for the hospitality from Wai, Connie and staff!   You cant beat the price for the quality nor the staff so I will be back.",

The wontons were exactly as described - light, crispy, and very flavorful. I had the special deep fried chicken over rice. Very good. My son had the special shrimp wonton soup and Mr. Picky-eater scarfed most of it down. We brought the leftovers home & he just finished off the last of it. My husband had the beef ramen and salt & pepper chicken wings. He proclaimed it all delicious. We split the fresh vegetables in oyster sauce and I have to say, they were perfectly steamed with just the right amount of oyster sauce, not swimming in it. Lastly, I topped it off with the almond pudding. Heavenly with a nice amount of lychees mixed in. 2 appetizers, 3 substantial main courses, 1 side dish enough for all three of us, and dessert came in right at $30. Anywhere else would have run us $50-$70.  The restaurant was small, but very clean and they keep the kitchen open to view, and it was very evident the owners take a lot of pride in keeping things clean and hygienic. The ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and very clean. Usually, restrooms in most restaurants can be a bit scary. I say if the owners put this much attention on cleanliness and quality in their restrooms, an area often overlooked by other eating establishments, then they must put even more emphasis on cleanliness in the kitchen and the quality of the food. In this case, I'm right. All through the meal, I heard the chef (owner?) directing the cooks with cautions on not to overcook this, oversteam that, etc... It is clear they take a lot of pride in their business and are committed to delivering quality at prices that are extremely easy on the wallet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

    "text": "Funny how many people complain about the service? Seriously what do you expect? Everything on the menu is about $5 dollars? This isn't a five star restaurant. I found this place by asking the dealers and staff at the various casinos I went to. Where's the best and cheapest authentic Asian food around? Good number of them said Big Wong. I started to laugh since we had one in NYC.    I decided to check it out with my friends.  Yes I admit the service is a bit slow but then again we ate there on a Saturday night when the place was full. One waitress working and she looked stress out. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I can relate. Food came out hot though and was surprisingly tasty. I was very surprise since I'm from the East coast and I think Asian food there is the best in the USA. Yes I'm a little bias.   The environment was plain and not flashy, nothing spectacular about it.  They didn't rush us out and we just hung out talking about our plans for the evening.  Our total cost was about $40 dollars for 4 grown men and trust me we can all eat. I was laughing about the price. It's unreal and I don't know how this place can stay afloat with these prices. We tip the waitress $8 dollars bringing each of our totals to $12 dollars for a full meal. Still cheaper than any restaurant I know in NYC. The waitress was shocked and thought we made a mistake. I ask her why?  Standard tip in NY is about 15% to 20% so this was right. I guess people in Vegas tip much less? Perhaps it's a West coast thing. Maybe that's why you get the service you do. Who knows?   As long as the food is good and served hot. I really don't care too much about the service. The food did come out pretty fast even though I didn't get a smile.   Any event if you want good Chinese food.  I would suggest this place. It's as good as it gets for the price and not the decor or the service which many complain about.  Try the Chicken Wings! It's totally AWESOME!",

QUALITY of ingredients is 5 Star, I mean c'mon - Shrimp in the fried wontons, not filler - Choice ribeye, not some strip steak. PORTION size, well . . . you shouldn't leave hungry. PRICE . . . $4.95 (5.95 for the new one)?? Wow. I took a large handful of flyers to help do my part to get these guys started, and I'm telling everyone I know. Definitely a 'will be back'.",

    "text": "3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the price, 1 star for the service. Ambiance? Well, it's a classic 'cheap eats, hole-in-the-wall joint', so nuff said. Read about the place in an old Las Vegas Weekly mag and put it on the list of 'places to try'. My guy was hungry for beef ramen, so we had beef ramen, hoi nam chicken with special rice, and salt n pepper chicken wings. The beef ramen was tasty but um... it tasted like pho. The broth had that distinct 'anise' flavor that adding 'five spice' brings. Our first tip off should have been when our chubby waitress said \"you want tendons with that?\" (we did). If you want your ramen to taste like pho, this is the place. The hoi nam chicken came with special rice and 2 sauces. The rice and sauces made the poached chicken very yummy. The star was the salt n pepper chicken wings. I would go back for them wings and for anything else they serve 'salt n pepper'  style. That was the winner! Our 3 orders set us back about $15, less than a drink at a hi-style restaurant on the Strip, so no complaints about the price. The service was a joke. The chubby waitress with the pony tail and glasses was/is the quintessential inefficient wait help: slow to come over and take your order, slow in bringing the check, all the while acting flustered like she is overwhelmed (the place doesn't have a zillion tables). The party next to us finally got tired of waiting for their check so they just left money on the table and walked out, the chubby waitress barely took notice... guess she figured they left money, so why rush over. How's that for slow service?",

I also like the fact they bring out the green onions, and hot sauce condiments so you can add more flavor to it as needed. The fresh diced green onions add a fresh flavor to the rich soup.  Since their opening, they have added more menu items but I can't eat the special shrimp noodle soup and something else because their portions are more than enough for one person.   Next time I will have to come back with a group so I can try their other items.",

    "text": "The price for all the food selection is descent. Everything is under $12 and the portions that are given are generous. The only thing price wise that I believe didn't make sense was the fact that my fried fish dish didn't come with rice so they charged me an extra dollar for a side of rice. Most Asian restaurants have the protein come alongside with the rice. But it was still fine. I just found it odd. My husband ordered the beef tendon noodle soup. He said it lacked flavor but he asked for soy sauce and sriracha which was an easy fix. We ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer. It was crispy and good. It was packed in this little restaurant but the food came out in a timely manner. My food came out a little bit later than my husband's, but I was fine because I wasn't at the point of being hangry, HAHA. Anyway. The reason why I would give this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because it was hard to enjoy the meal due to the people yelling in the kitchen. There was a man yelling at all of the kitchen staff very aggressively. He kept yelling for the cooks to hurry up and same with the food runners. I suppose there was a moment when the cooks asked for the next order and the main man who was yelling yelled at the server, \"SPIT IT OUT! THEY'RE READY!\" Really? Just looking and hearing from the outside, it is like their establishment is noy organized at all. I work in a restaurant too so I know how it feels to be under pressure and I know myself that I could not handle a work enviornment like that. As my husband and I continued eating, I even heard the lady who took my order yelling. She told the staff that how busy it was today compared to Christmas is nothing. She yelled, \"If you guys can handle Christmas, you can handle this too!\" It just didn't give a professional outlook. When I went to the front to pay, I asked him to break my 20 dollar bill so I can tip and he didn't have cash in the drawer so he pulled out his wallet to give me change. I was stunned. I had never seen when employees have to use their own money for exchanging for change for the customers. All in all, if you want something cheap that is not fast food, then I would say this place is for you. But be warned that it is not professional and their service is very quick paced and they do not come back to check on you. And the kitchen is very noisy with everyone yelling at each other about what orders they need and what needs to be done rather than just getting things done.",

The food is rather simplistic, not too fancy but, it has it's uniqueness.

With things like Fish Balls (it's basically a fish meatball) which is really good in curry and again, it's not too fancy but very different.. a good different. I'm posting this review after my first Time at Big Wong and I had the Curry Fishball, the Curry was a little bitter but not in bad taste, it added a nice texture to already good Curry. This is definitely a dish I'd recommend, especially with added green onion. The employees were pretty cool and chill and were respectful to their fellow employees and the customers. And also, the name Big Wong is very unique and memorable. Definitely a good place to grab some nicely priced, good food in Vegas! I definitely recommend it!",

I got the fried pork and rice, which I loved. The rest of the table ordered the beef ramen, fried shrimp wontons, and the salt and pepper chicken. My fiance said they were all equally tasty. In lieu of fried rice we ordered the seasoned rice for the child in our group, she may not have cared for it, but I enjoyed it with my pork.   Will have to come back and try again!",

But this place is all about good food, good prices, good quality. Most Chinese restaurants are overly greasy and leave you with a less than satisfactory taste of MSG. But you'll leave Big Wong's with a full tummy and they won't put a dent in your bank account.  Right next door to Monta, they're not there to have a ramen battle. Their ramen is NOT Japanese style; its a cross between pho & oxtail soup with ramen noodles thrown in. But there's so much variety, be sure to try the rest of the menu--99% of it is $4.95. So don't be cheap and order a few different dishes. A few suggestions: crispy shrimp wontons, salt & pepper wings, & the chicken curry.  Happy NOM-ing.  TIP: Call ahead! They do take-out and they use quality containers, not those cheesy chinese-y boxes.",

You really can't beat it.  I could probably eat three plates of the chicken curry roti, if left to my own devices.  No alcohol, but some folks in the back were doing BYOB.",

The wontons cooked and seasoned well but the shrimps were mushy and a bit chewy. The rice noodle soup kept absorbing the broth and grr to fill the whole bowl leaving very little broth. Easy fast or ask for more broth in side. Overall, it was good.   House wonton soup had a light broth and only wontons with chinese broccoli. It was tasty.   Salt and pepper chicken was crispy and needed some more pepper. It was still worth getting.   Pork ribs and black bean sauce tasted like chinese sausage and had few black beans. It was okay. Needed salt.",

Did a quick yelping and saw that the beef ramen was supposed to be good and since I was already in the fixing for ramen anyways I decided to give it a shot.  It was at best...mediocre. The broth had an average taste with nothing unique about it, however, the beef was very fatty and not enjoyable to eat. Next time I will definately choose to wait for the other ramen joint rather than be impatient.",

We were craving good ol' home cooking, so we ventured down Spring Mountain Rd. We stumbled into Big Wong's and couldn't have left any happier. We got the fried wontons, fried chicken wings, and a noodle soup for right around $15. Wait, why do we wait 2 hrs and pay $50 for buffets again? The wings were perfectly crispy with a subtle sweet and spicy glaze. The wontons were light, and the soup was the perfect cure for our 7 PM hangover. There are so many great spots in Chinatown down Spring Mountain, but I definitely won't forget to stop by BW the next time we're in town.",

The first time was while we were at an Eastside Asian restaurant where the Hainan Chicken was $18/half $25/whole and I thought to myself, \"Man, for this kind of money I could be up to my neck in Hainan Chicken at Big Wong!\" And the second time was just now. Talk about slow simmer, it's been a couple months since I've eaten there and I want to go back.   \"You don't know what you got till it's gone.\" - Cinderella (1988)  I will do my best to campaign for Big Wong to be on our Mr. Tofu Circle Of Frequent Eats (I just made that up, we don't actually have an official Mr. Tofu Circle Of Frequent Eats, but it sounds cool - like a Disneyland ride.) I am happy that Big Wong exists. The value is undeniable. It will be my next solo meal mission for sure!",

We ventured here for lunch and had a Shrimp Wonton Egg Noodle Soup, Hainan Chicken with Rice, Gai Lan with Garlic, and the Curry with Roti.  The Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup.  Hainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry.  The rice didn't have that great hainan chicken flavor to it and the sauces they gave were just a spicy sauce and what seemed to be the soy sauce chicken marinade.  The Gai Lan was good with lots of garlic.  The Curry with Roti might have had to be the best dish.  They were out of a lot of things, but not going to ding them on that.  I'm not sure if they even had the items, it would have changed my mind much.",

Poor service and mediocre food, I can make better food at home. Wouldn't have given this place a try but thought hey they got pretty good reviews. Sorry yelpers, not sure why it was great? 1st visit there with a party of 6 during dinner hour and was greeted by a grumpy middle age woman, she was busy calculating tickets and told us \"you have to wait\" when I told her we have a party of 6, her awful tone of voice made me feel like I was scolded by mom! Not the way you would greet your guest! Took her forever to service us after we got a table and they were not super busy. Just gave me the feeling she didn't like working there. The food was very simple, basic and bland! That's why I think I can make better tasting food at home. Maybe because the price was cheap thats why people are okay with it? Another time was just our family of 4 during a late lunch hour around 3:00 service was slow because there's only one guy running the show for maybe 3 tables there. Felt bad for him having to do tables and cook the food but he wasn't too friendly either. Well came here 3 times and my husband said \"shame on us for not learning the 1st 2 time\"! Don't waste your $5! That's how bad.  A side note, if I was the owner I would at least provide a bit of friendly service to my customers. A smile and Thank You wouldn't hurt, we are paying customers and not beggars for us to be treated this way. IMO",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Big Wong for a while now. After talking hubby into trying out \"a place I found on yelp\" he agreed so on we went. So we enter BW and only 2 tables have people. We ask for 3 plus a high chair. She goes to the back and grabs the high chair but as shes placing it at the farthest table she yells \"I'm seating you in the back okay!\" uummm sure. Now I don't give a crap where we sit buuuut don't yell at my family please, thank you. This is about the time my hubby started giving me the stink eye. Took all of about 15 seconds after walking in. The lady comes back with the menus and I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted but hubby had to peruse. We ordered tea with lemon, sprite, and a water for my kids. She brought our drinks and my daughter(shes 4) started taking the lid off the lady was like \"no no no, I spent all morning cleaning the floors, keep the lid on\" now if this lady had been playing around it would be one thing. BUT SHE WASN'T!! Don't parent my children!   Now on to the food. Salt and pepper chicken wings-awesome. The only really good thing we ordered.   Deep fried pork chop-it was ok. The sauce that came with was down right gross. Thank goodness it was on the side.   Shrimp won ton soup with udon-easy to explain, are ya ready? Shrimp wonton, udon, and a few greens floating in water. This soup had ZERO flavor.   Ribeye-so my hubby ordered this and I don't know why. It was excessively fatty and pretty tough. They tryed to pass off raw as medium. I work at a steak house so um when the meat is purple it's definitely not medium. So he asked for it to be cooked longer. Came back burned.   All in all I guess its cheap and you get what you pay for. The cashier/server lady needs some customer service lessons. Sorry Big Wong you get a worthy one star.",

What it is - a beefy broth with ramen noodles cooked to a nice al dente with lots of beef chunks (brisket type cubes.) While a great deal for the money my personal preference would be towards less beef and a softer cut - but I dare not ding them on my \"opinion.\"  The wings were a real surprise. Thin crispy skin and juicy meat inside with a gentle heat that builds. A nice change from sauce laden buffalo wings.  In all a filling meal of fresh ingredients for about $10-11.",

    "text": "I was finally able to try this restaurant after reading so many reviews about it. As advertised, their beef ramen dish was prominently displayed on the walls . The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived so it was surprising that there was no one at the counter to seat me. After a few minutes, the hostess appeared from the back and allowed me to choose my seat.   I didn't bother to look at the menu and just asked for the beef ramen. The waitress mentioned their other new items, such as shrimp wontons. I was tempted but decided to wait till next time. My order was brought out after a few minutes. It is basically a version of my favorite dish: braised beef in soup with noodles only the soup in this case is clear[er] instead of dark. The soup was just okay, you could definitely tell it was a beef broth/stock and it wasn't too salty. I do wish there was more beef flavor in the broth. The noodles were okay as well, not too chewy or soggy. I had the waitress add some tendon in addition to the meat since I wanted to see if they stewed the meat long enough. Big Wong did pass with flying colors in this department. The meat and tendon were cooked until nice tender and soft. The dish also came with a small dish of chopped green onions and hot sauce if you wanted. I did notice the waitress giving other tables small containers of chopped green onions as opposed to the small dish I got. *boooh!*   Overall, not a bad lunch for about $8 with tax and tip. Service could use a little polish though.",

He probably didn't speak Chinese and just answered, \"I don't know\". When my wife asked him questions in English, he became impatient and started walking away from our table.  I told my wife to forget it, he's probably not liking his job or having a bad day.  We just ordered a several items based on pictures on Yelp and were okay with the food.  However, the Salt and Pepper Chicken came out pretty dark.  They may have over-fried it or re-fried to reuse some leftovers.  The kids didn't finish all their food for that reason.  We left with giving him a 15% tip, which I think he didn't deserve, but I was later told by my wife the next day that he called us 'cheap' on our way out.  Wish I knew at the time so I could give him a piece of my mind.",

The curry has just a tiny bit of heat, and the chicken literally just falls apart (in the good way). Another favorite of my would be the fried pork chop rice, because it comes with this awesome awesome dipping sauce which tastes kinda like porky gravy. A great dessert item is the sweetened roti pancake which is only a dollar! (!!) It's a roti pancake covered in condensed milk and powered sugar ( along with rainbows and sunshine and all things delicious)",

I struggled a bit & still decide to order the hainan chicken.  My husband ordered curry! We were both surprised & satisfied!  The hainan chicken's \"rice\" is really good & yummy too!  The meal portion is big.  Never expected, and price & taste way exceed our expectation!  Already told all my friends who travel to LV that this is a must visit restaurant.

I  order a few things. The shrimp wontons I order and then I order the fish balls, then the deep fried pork on white rice, then I order the beef noodle ramen. I'm not that impress. I see why it's cheap cause you get what you order from the price range. The beef ramen has a strange weird smell and taste. Its fresh but it just had that strange taste and smell. The fish balls wasn't real fish, it tasted very generic and fake, almost like a hot dog shape like balls, the texture is like the hotdog inside texture. The shrimp wontons are great as I said earlier, the deep fried pork on rice was good. I feel like I wasted money, I spent 24 dollars and I tip them 5 dollars and so altogether 27 dollars. The best thing I like was the food was packed pretty good, nothing will fall out. The food tasted fresh. The lady that took my order didn't have a personality but she wasn't rude and so that's good, a least she wasn't rude but no personality. I guess  this is a learning experience to be careful and do my research on a restaurant first before going over there. Lesson learn for me. It just sucks when you have your hopes up high, in hopes that you will get great food and then you eat the food, to find out the disappointment of wasting money and not enjoying the food that I order. I'm sure they have other great things on the menu but I won't ever be back at that place again. I tasted way better. A least there is some positives about this restaurant. I'm not going to even sweat the negatives thing, I just laugh and keep moving. I'm just thankful to have food. Life goes on, we learn, That's what makes us better people.",

Needless to say I wasn't too impressed with the shrimp.  I also ordered some of the Beef Ramen it tasted somewhat buttery with an after taste of what I can only describe as Vaseline intense care hand lotion. I know that sounds weird but I could barely eat it with the after taste it left me.   The Curry Chicken Roti was probably my favorite thing that I ordered. Hot and flavorful!

    "text": "Folks, Big Wong is now batting 4th in this line up.  $4.95 OUT THE DOOR for their chicken and rice that is literally enough for 2 meals and is all cooked healthy, LOCK that sh*t up!  This is a masterpiece of a Restaurant. Food is always out quick. The employees are nice and speak good English. One lady actually had an east coast/Asian accent which I found just awesome.  I had some pita bread thing with curry sauce that was great. FREE hot tea the entire experience.  I thought I was going to get some garbage food for a cute little hangover; NOPE.  I couldn't believe the price for such lean good food.   The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was a bad odor in the joint. It could have been the area but I', not sure, just being safe with my rating.",

My family eats out a lot, all kinds of foods, but we will now stop going to Big Won't and their Big Waitress Attitude, she is always rude. She acts like she's Big Won and you're nothing won. She treats people like she hates her life or something. I have taken my family there for over 2 years or so, maybe once a month. She was rude starting day one, we ignore it, hoping that she becomes more polite. But she's the most horrible server.  Her energy is almost hateful. You have to make a loud noise to request any attention from her and sometimes that is not enough, she will ignore you talking to her sometime as well, and then you have to get up and go to her with any request, including if you want to order extra food. She never ask if you need anything, she acts like she's pissed off even when you try to pay. I feel a little sorry for the owner, she is costing him money because if people want to order extra food, his restaurant will profit more but the waitress always treats you like she's angry if you ask her for anything, including ordering or paying your bill. I guess losing profit is what he deserves, he's responsible for her being there. Her bad attitude is weird because it never change even though we keep being nice to her and even give her good tips, hoping she will realize what's going on but it doesn't work, she just always remains rude. Her disrespect, has never ended, so it's not worth the cheap food. We're done, she BIG FAILED, long time.",

They were like thin, flattened out croissants. When we were leaving there were a bunch of people eating the said \"pancakes\" outside. I guess people come order them to go and they serve them with a sweet cream sauce to pour on them. So sad we missed out on that.

Quality of food is still good and the food comes out quick. Restaurant still looks clean. We had the chicken curry, chicken and rice, and the wonton soup with egg noodles.   One of the reason why I do not want to come back is because our waiter is not friendly. She never smiles. When we say thank you, she doesn't make eye contact. We use to go very often, but every time we go, it's as if she never met us before. No matter how good the food is, customer service means everything to me. We were actually going to have lunch elsewhere, but we decided to come here because of the quick service.",

(I'm not a tendon fan but it was pretty decent.) And it's under $6!  They also have a steak special that is Under $10, the steak is good (cooked on a flat top so it's a little different) and the sides are fresh (the baby bok choi is amazing)!  Also they've been serving up a mango pudding, I don't know if it's on the menu officially yet, but it's really good, and I'm sure they'll serve up an order for you if you want.  I have to go back to try the Soy Sauce Chicken and the other new Chicken Special.  The staff is friendly and the price is cheap, it's hard to beat Big Wong.  you know I'll be back",

It took quite a bit of a wait and I was super hungry at the time, but once I got my food I forgot all about the hunger and just dove in. The service was great. I happen to visit on a busy day (even though it was around 2pm) but there was no problem tending to my needs. I also ordered their chicken wings to go. Their almond pudding with lychee was a refreshing break from the oily food I just consumed.   I don't know if they changed the minimum amount of $10 for those paying with a card, but I honestly find it inconvenient for me since I never carry cash and use my debit to pay for everything. So I was somewhat \"forced\" to order more that I wanted. *shrugs* I guess I shouldn't be surprised since most places have that $10 minimum =/  Other than that, this place is great. Everything was affordable, which is a good thing for a college student like myself.",

My husband, however, wants to give it a second try bc the prices are so cheap. Let's hope we can find something good on their menu.   The lady serving was rude... But I think that's pretty typical of Asian restaurants, so I didn't find that too offensive.  Also, i wonder why they can't use reusable plastic cups when they clearly wash their plates. All beverages are served in styrofoam cups. Ugh. I hate styrofoam. Not just bc it's not eco-friendly, but I might have an irrational fear of styrofoam. I hate the sounds and texture. It's just gross. :( Please get real cups!",

First time we had the wonton soup (good), chicken curry and pancakes (mediocre), chicken wings (yummy), and something else I can't remember.   The next day, before driving back to SoCal, my fiance and I picked up some food to eat that night since we knew we would be tired after the long drive home.   We got their Hainan chicken,  fried wonton, and baby bok choy.  Holy cow!!! Everything was so yummy (even though we munched tirelessly in the car and the food was cold by dinnertime), especially their chicken and bok choy.      Im glad i discovered Big Wong and told friends and family about it. Their price is extremely reasonable and would confidently recommend Big Wong to anyone wanting some good Hong Kong style cafe foods in Vegas.  Ps: there was only one server when we dined in.  She seemed a little overwhelmed but the service is like many other Asian restaurants.   It's yummy, hot food for the price of a burger and fries- don't come expecting a red carpet service.",

Curry has a slight kick and the cjicken is moist and tender. Some giant potatoes. My favorite dish.  Beef ramen ($5.95): strong star anise scent but not bad.   Located in a plaza with a lot of great food options including ramen, curry, sushi, and Japanese Italian. Plenty of free parking. Restaurant is clean and spacious. Service is quick and efficient albeit not terribly friendly. At the same time, there was only one girl doing everything so she was pretty busy.",

The entrees were prepared on the bland side but it does come with sauce that makes up for it. I was so amazed that places like this still exist.   The greeter/owner? had a wry sense of humor that I found funny but I can imagine that it can easily be misinterpreted as rude by someone else.   I got the: Hoi Nam Chicken & Rice, steak & pasta, sweet roti Pros: Price, just enough portions, sauce Cons: Parking in an always full lot",

    "text": "Great service, good food, and cheap eats. If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that won't break bank, Big Wong is an ideal location for you because they offer an assortment of dishes for under $6.   I ordered a special shrimp soup wonton with udon or ramen, I asked the guy if they had egg noodle, they did, so I went with that. I might have misread the title on the menu, because I was expecting regular wonton noodle soup with shrimp, which is what my other two friends had gotten, but what I got was actually shrimp soup. The broth was a rich red color and tasted exactly like shrimp. I probably wouldn't order that again because it was just too much for me to enjoy the soup, my mistake...but other than that, the noodles were great, wish they gave more wontons, but also I feel like the wonton were a tad overcooked, and the shrimp seemed mushy, but it actually wasn't.  They had bok coy cooked 2 ways I believe, decided to go with garlic, and I thought that was their best thing there, also under $6, most Chinese places would probably charge like $9+ for that, unless you get it during like a special lunch item. But ya, the bok choy was flavored well, didn't taste or look old, it had that nice bright green color, good crips, I would definitely order that again. The curry beef looked good, didn't get to try it, and my friend said the beef ramen soup was delicious.",

I asked the ladies next to me what i should get. I wound up with the shrimp dumpling wonton soup and asparagus.DELICIOUS. I couldn't get enough of the broth.  I had a small order of the thin ribeye. it was very good just not a lot of it and i could do without the rice and potatoes. The rice however looked like a big scoop, but it all fell apart and tasted so fresh. t wasn't a starchy ball on y plate. Details people. I had the wings. So good. i mean they are salt and pepper wings with jalapenos and I'm telling you they were delicate. i mean some of the best wings i have ever had.  I finished off with the Roti pancake with powdered sugar and condensed milk. It was good but not great. glad it was only 1.25.  All in all it was a great meal and I will be back.",

    "text": "Finally had the chance to try Big Wong with David S, Jade W and Angela T after working up quite an appetite volunteering at Clean the World. Even after a very hot August day doing manual labor in a non air conditioned warehouse: I HAD to try the much lauded shrimp wonton with ramen.   So many people bitch about Yelp hype...these delicate dumplings filled with perfectly cooked, whole shrimp were in a word: divine. The noodles are firm and springy and hold up against any of the hipster noodle joints IMHO. Such a simple dish that is the best I've had outside of Asia! Being a big fan of bok choy, I was going to order it, but the very friendly waitress suggested I try the Chinese Broccoli: fantastic. Each of us enjoyed our respective dishes and I left with two large take away boxes for a treat later on. And, since it is in Chinatown = inexpensive and made fresh under $10 for 2 meals!  Lives up to and beyond the hype. I'm all about the Big Wong. Parking can be tricky as it shares space with many popular spots in a very busy lot but get yoself over there ASAP. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, all ya gotta do is call and I'll be there at the Big Wong, yes I will, you've got a fan ;)))   Yelp 100 Challenge",

Waited in a short line (I was hanging out of the door) at 1 PM, and I see the backs of the guys at the front of the line, and it is Anthony T. and Tien N. no less!  I yelled out and they had me join them.    After being seated, we got our orders in pretty fast and my food was cold (I expected that after reading Bobby Y.'s review) so I got to eat first!  I ordered #1 Hainan chicken white meat - it came with cucumbers, the rice cooked in chicken broth, and 2 dipping sauces.  The spicy sauce was killer - after I finished the chicken and the cucumber I poured the sauce on the rice and ate it last.  It was pretty good.  The only time I had similar food was at a food cart in Portland.  Tien had the curry chix with roti and Anthony had the thin ribeye with rice/potatoes.  Definitely worth the buck.  Tien graciously treated me with his stack of quarters.  I probably would not rush back but it will be cheap even once it goes up to $4.95 per dish, and the rice and spicy sauce *are* pretty tasty.",

Big Wong is located in a shopping plaza with other very popular restaurants(Snowflake, Raku, Monta) it is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss. The menu is short and simple but the food is all tasty, especially for being so inexpensive. The Hoi Nam Chicken (Hainese Chicken and rice) and the deep fried pork chop are currently my favorites and I highly recommend trying them along with the rest of the menu. Only negative is the food can take a while when they are crowded as their staff number is small. I highly recommend trying big Wong(and then go to snow flake for dessert:))",

Anyways, we love this place, especially my 4 year old daughter. Her ultimate favorite is their Fried Shrimp wontons. We pretty much tried everything in the menu, but I myself always get thin rib-eye over rice and soup, either beef ramen or house shrimp soup with udon noodles. The hubby usually gets curry chicken with roti and soup, either their shrimp soup with wontons or seafood noodle soup. For those who say that the service sucks, we'll get to know Connie she's actually a nice lady. Although sometimes she has an attitude it's because there are some rude customers too. We have witness quite a few when we were there. Lastly it's clean I like that they use disposable utensils. I know it not Eco-friendly but in my opinion I feel safe that the spoon that someone put in their mouth will never be the same spoon that I'll be using. It's just I'm cool with styrofoam cups too :)! Oh yeah I almost forgot the price is so affordable. Every time we go here it's around $35-$40 with tip and I still have a little bit of left over for breakfast the next day.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Flavor - The slow cooked beef in the beef ramen is definitely a head turner. Some of their other items are a bit hit or miss.        - Value - You can't go wrong with most of the dishes being under $5. This place is, without a doubt, a good value        - Decor - The inside is simple and reminds me a lot of the hole in the wall restaurants in cali. However, those places are also really good. **Ordered**        - $5.95 #15 Beef Ramen - Slow cooked fork tender beef brisket in ramen. The broth really has the flavor of the beef in it. This is a must try (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=_Ol_FjEJS3TDp11m7amNLQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnV...</a>).        - $4.95 #21 Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - The chicken was moist and delicious. I tend to like salty foods so this was perfectly seasoned for me (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=MOolbZ9HluooQUfoGXmCeQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnV...</a>).        - $4.95 #2 Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken Over Special Seasoned Rice - The chicken comes with a soy based sauce and a chili sauce rather than the usual ginger and green onion sauce. The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce and rice were tasty (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=vLkVcA20AojLDusn38f2fA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnV...</a>).        - $4.95 #8 Authentic Curry Chicken Service with 3 Roti Pancakes - Chicken was a little dry and the potatoes were under cooked. The curry was OK, but the roti pancakes, if you don't mind a bit of oil, were spectacular. I'd order the pancakes alone if I could (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=Mrul8D6-5mwJ-26rna6d5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnV...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place for a cheap meal. The beef ramen is probably one of the best I've had.",

    "text": "I was gonna give this place a 5 star rating for their awesome curry chicken, but the service really made a difference. There was only one person working in the front trying to handle 7 tables. I'd be irritated if I were in their place, but wasn't an excuse for her unfriendly attitude towards customers.   She ended up spilling a cup of water on my cousin as she arrived with his food. Then she left the empty cup on our table and spill on the floor for about 5 minutes before doing anything about it, which seemed potentially hazardous.  My bill was $9.90 and when I went up to pay, the lady was like, \"minimum $10 to use a card.\" I said, \"What if I add tip to the card?\" and she said, \"No.\" I was like, \"Really? Why don't you just add 10 cents to my bill then?\" She proceeded to give me a dirty look, and just swiped my card and charged me $9.90 - but wait a minute, I thought $10 was the minimum, Lol.  Anyway, service aside, the food is excellent and the prices are really cheap for the portion that you get. If you can look past the quality of service and some of the tackiness about the place (it felt like they weren't using A/C, their water and tea is served in styrofoam cups, and there's multicolored posterboard [the same that people use for yard sales] with menu items written down and taped to the wall), then I'd recommend coming here to eat if you're in the mood for various, cheap Asian-style food.",

    "text": "I totally echoed with some other reviewers, the service really sucked there! They never smiled and sometimes I feel that customers are paying them to treat customers badly. It's like they don't care if you give them business or not. The price is very attractive but then after visting there for couple times, I eventually figured that it's not worth it because I never ate comfortably in the restaurant when their faces (the only lady who served customers and the kitchen staff, especially the female cook) always look upset. Why can't they smile a little more? Like another reviewer said, we always said thank you, when being seated, when the drinks came, when the food came, we said thank you. But there was no acknowledgement of our thanks, and the face was like \"whatever\".  The first time I went there I asked very politely if they have a bathroom (i asked after placing orders), and the lady was giving me an irritated look, as if I was a fool to ask.  I think the food is cheap because they only have so few employees there. And I guess that's why there is no good service, I think anyone could go postal if one has to do everything with no help. I did see that \"only lady\" taking orders, serving drinks, bringing out food, sweeping the floor, etc, all by herself. Poor thing.....and poor customers too. I guess that's why the \"only lady\" always has an irritated face. Though I can be empathetic, I still disagree with such kind of service. But I still can't figure out why the female cook has an irritated face. The male cook doesn't have an irritated look. But then he works in the kitchen mostly, so can't really compensate the unpleasant aura caused by the other 2 ladies. By the way, the female cook doesn't come out often either, but for that one time she did came out, she looked at me as if I was an eye sore for her, and I was just eating, not doing anything wrong though.  I think I would rather be starved instead of going back again....way too much discomfort to eat with that unpleasant aura. It's not worth it though the food is cheap.",

    "text": "Like most others who have written a review, I came here for their fabulous grand opening specials. Nothing really beats a meal and drink for one dollar.   Would I go back to this place with their normal prices? Probably.  Would I come back here often? Probably not.   On my first visit I indulged and ordered two items. First off was the fried pork chop. It was disappointing to say the least. It was kind of bland and chewy. The sauce that accompanied it was pretty tasty though.The highlight of the dish was the perfecly cooked boiled egg that came with it, which provided for a nice surprise. The second item ordered was their wonton soup. This was actually quite good. The wontons were cooked well and the broth was good. It had nice flavor without being too salty.   The second time going, I ordered their hainan chicken [which is served cold by the way, as it helps keep the chicken tender]. The chicken was mediocre. But how nice can cold steamed chicken really get? The rice that accompanies it is supposed to be 'seasoned.' I didn't taste much of a difference between that and their regular white rice though. I guess the highlight of the dish were the two sauces that come with. Mix em together, and you have a killer sauce which makes up for the rest of the dish. I'd probably order this dish again, just to get the sauce.   All in all, the service is pretty good. I was surprised that everyone was being so friendly, considering the hectic days they must have had opening the restaurant. And the quickness of the food coming out was great as well. Their prices are pretty decent as well. There's nothing for more than five dollars, and all prices are tax included.   So, if you want a cheap Chinese meal, definitely come here. And just a side note - if you go hungry, I'd avoid ordering the pork chop. The serving size is a lot smaller compared to the chicken. When I ordered the pork & wonton soup, I easily ate both [& I hate to admit it, because it makes me seem like a fatty, but I could've eaten more. =p]. However, the day I went and only ordered the chicken, I was completely content.",

    "text": "This place is great for authentic Chinese food at a very reasonable price. I have been here several times. I usually get the hoi nam chicken with seasoned rice (boneless dark meat). The seasoned rice is a nice steer away from plain white rice. The chicken is always tender. The two sauces that comes with the dish is what really gives its flavor. The chicken wings are also da-bomb. They're so crispy and are seasoned very well. I also like the sliced jalapenos that comes with the wings. The fried pork with rice is also pretty good. I would also recommend trying the pork congee if you're able to get your hands on some (they are usually out of it). The flavor is decent but you can't beat the price (about $4!) I wouldn't get the fish congee... It was a little too fishy taste for me. The beef ramen could be better. I would recommend either paying a little more to go to a ramen place or making your own ramen. Overall this place is a must try... You will be pleasantly surprised and won't break the bank. Warning: parking here can really suck.",

To me, it tasted a little water down. But the chicken make up for the curry sauces. I felt like he chicken was the curry it self. But overall all the other dish were great for under $5.",

It's a nice small restaurant in Chinatown,not crowded which I like. I didn't realized how cheap the food is here! When I mean cheap...it's cheap! What I would recommend when ordering a steak dish...if you like rare steak, I would recommend ordering the steak medium rare to medium well-done. And their sauce...the black pepper sauce is the bomb!!! I don't like sauce in most Chinese restaurants/cafe because I'm very picky on the taste and sometimes or most time it's a little sweet. But this one...just hit the spot! So delicious...I even dunk my potatoes and steak in the sauce plus drenched it in my rice. So good in the white rice. We also ordered wonton soup with no noodles and egg noodle soup. Everyone enjoyed it. We also order spicy salt n pepper shrimp which is actually spicy because they use Serrano peppers. I like it!   Service was awesome considering the lady was the only person in the front and waiting tables. She was very attentive. Food came out accordingly and fast! I will definitely come back if I want Chinese food. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a>   Btw, I was so hungry that I had no chance taking pictures of the food...sorry not sorry.",

    "text": "This is a good choice if you're looking for inexpensive food on the way back home from Vegas. You actually get a good amount for the price you pay, and the quality is good too. Some Chinese restaurants can be cheap with their wonton and only have a pinch of meat in there, but Big Wongs isn't cheap about that. I highly recommend their salt and pepper chicken wings.   Parking can be difficult to find, but there's a lot right across the street you can probably park at.   The atmosphere is a whole different story. I would have rated this place with 2 stars if it weren't for the good food. It's a smaller restaurant where the kitchen is right by the seating area, and there isn't a door or anything that separates the 2 rooms. The service isn't bad, but there is only one main server running the entire restaurant with 2 other guys helping. The wait time to order, have our food served, and everything overall was short considering how short staffed they were. Then there's the main guy who seems to be the manager, directing everyone what to do and what tables to serve. Except he isn't talking to them in an indoor voice... he's literally shouting at them and the entire restaurant is listening. It's like they were putting on a show for us. I get that he's trying to run the restaurant efficiently, which he was, but they need to have a door separating the rooms. He needs to understand that this does not create a peaceful dining experience for his customers.   I've been here about 4 times and this has only happened once. Hopefully they'll read this and change their methods of interacting with each other so their customers will have a more enjoyable experience.",

I went with a Beef ramen with shrimp wontons. I knew very well this isn't what they specialize in but my stomach was leading. It was decent and hit a spot of what was needed. I hope to return to try some more of their specialities. Overall, 3 stars",

Very reasonably priced.  Easy parking. Why not a \"5\"? Service was excellent but the main waitress with glasses (think she was one of the owners) just gave us the sense that she didnt care either way for our business. I would order one dish and she would say \"next?\"..order total of 13 dishes and after each dish she would follow it with \"next\"  Felt like I was dealing more with a drill sergeant than a waitress!  She never smiled.  I complimented the food a few times and no response or smile.  Told her it was our first time..brought in a party of 10 and how happy we were to find this \"gem.\" No response or acknowledgment of what I said.  She was attentive but we felt sense of aire... \"eat and leave\" and \"I hear that all time how good we are.\"  Waitress at one point became annoyed when we asked her for extra plates.  She said \"ok..I'm not going to keep coming back.  How many more plates do you want?\" That was quite shocking!  So..for food..definitely.  For price..yes.  For service..yes, but DON'T expect service with a smile.",

Ironically the dish that they are next known for, hainan chicken,  is just not that good.  Very average.  The chicken, rice and ginger sauce are under flavored. The soy sauce is just soy sauce...doesn't have the sweet flavor.   The restaurant however does have several stand outs.  The shrimp broth noodle soup is delicious.  Sorry i forgot to take picture before I ate. You can really tell that the broth has a rich shrimp stock and the noodles are never ever cooked. They also have a fantastic morning glory vegetable dish. It comes in thai style, shrimp paste or garlic. I love the Thai style. It is so good. I would come for this dish alone. The curry and roti are also on point. The curry sauce is thick and flavorful, while the roti is crisp and airy.",

    "text": "Great place to come for good, cheap food but because of recent service experiences I'm sad to have to downgrade them because it's no longer of 4 star quality overall when you factor in their terrible customer service. If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.  I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.  People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!",

I ordered the ham nam chicken with rice and a side of salt and pepper wings. The waiter was both the cashier and taking orders as well. He didn't seem too friendly and was quick to get our order but did not ask us what to drink at first. This place is simple has styrofoam cups for water and disposable fork and spoons.  The ham nam chicken is okay. It was bland. There was 2 sauces on the side which I thought was very tasty. The salt and pepper wings are really good though. Too bad they don't have ketchup. I eat all my fried chicken wings with ketchup. My friend ordered the chicken curry, the Naan bread was soggy and the bread is supposed to be plump. Overall this place rates as a 3, worth the price for a cheap meal!",

With hungry old people not willing to wait, I had to search for the next best place that didn't have too long of a wait, yet offered some good good.   At Big Wongs, we were seated right away! No wait, with maybe 2 other tables in use. The first thing that caught my eyes, which I ordered with the quickness was the salt & pepper spicy wings! Uhmmm, yes please! Man, these babies were not only crunchy and good but the price was so reasonable! 8 pcs for $6, not bad.   The concept of this place is individual plates, so the prices per person is within $7-$13, SO reasonable! Someone can order two dishes for the price of one from a restaurant on the strip, like freal!   Majority of us ordered 16T: The Spicy Beef Curry with Tendon. I got mines xxxxxxxspicy! SO Dark Red! I loved the sauce from this. Oh&by the way, the portions are hella big. You get a big bowl of the beef curry with tendons and a plate of rice. This is worth $7.50!   Overall, this place is a good option for the restaurants in this shopping center!",

Finally I decided to go back again to see if that was an outlier, and was pleasantly surprised by a quality meal at a very good price.  I ordered three dishes to get a broad sample (and because they are individually cheap!)  The chicken curry with roti is fantastic. The chicken is nice and tender, the curry flavor is close to Malaysian but less spicey (basically non spicey), and the roti is a great addition to the dish. 4.5/5  Hainan chicken: better than my last experience--I think the dark meat is more juicy and flavorful. Still definitely not the best version I've had but one I would eat again (though I'll probably try something else next time). 3.5/4.  Dark meat deep fried chicken: it takes a while to come out but it is tasty. Heavy, very heavy. But nice flavor. Definitely worth getting. 4/5.  Overall, I had a very positive experience and I'll definitely be back again. The place felt cleaner and more harmonious: probably better staffing.  Big Wong might be the best bargain in Las Vegas. Practically food truck prices for good food.",

It was New Year's Eve and I had forgotten that a lot of restaurants were closing early, so Curry Zen was out of the picture. I didn't want to continue driving, so I looked around the parking lot and saw the illuminating lights of 'BIG WONG', and decided to try my luck at this place, and I am glad I did.  It was delicious, cheap and service was prompt.  When you first walk in, you see a few tables against the wall. It isn't a big place, but luckily there was a few tables and we were seated instantly. Our waiter gave us glasses of water and gave us our menu and quickly took our orders shortly after. He looked like the only one working the front of the house, so it was impressive how quickly and effectively he was able to remember everyone's order and deliver it right when it came out of the kitchen.   My husband and I were in the mood for some curry so we both ordered the curry with the 3 roti pancakes. I ordered beef and he ordered chicken. The curry was incredibly rich in flavor. You could tell that the beef was stewed til the cubes of beef fell apart and infused with the curry flavor. It was very delicious.  The meal only came out to $15 for the both of us. Talk about a deal. If you're looking for some authentic Chinese food at a great deal, this is your place!",

We also got a wonton soup and one with noodles. My dad got the fried boneless dark meat chicken (15 min wait). We also got salt and pepper chicken, stir fry ong choy - Thai style, and I wanted a roti.   The ribeyes were great! I didn't really touch my pasta because it was kind of bland (literally just pasta - I should have known). The wontons were so good! Well seasoned and had a great bite. The fried chicken was juicy and flavorful! The wings were slightly salty for my taste, but my family loved it. The ong choy was one of my standout dishes for the dinner - it was packed full of flavor and we finished every little bit! My favorite thing honestly was the roti!

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise! The food was delicious and the prices so reasonable that we each ordered at least 2 items. Four of us, 9 items. Appetizers included fried shrimp wonton, a must. It has a nice crunch and chunky shrimp patty. The wings were ok, maybe too cooked. Pancake had the right flavor and fluff. Shrimp wonton noodle was full of flavor. Even without the noodle, spicy shrimp wonton soup was just as delicious, if you like sate. Chicken & rice had yummy ginger sauce with good luck.  Both beef noodle soup were consistently good.  So much food that we could not finish the rib eye over pasta. Looks plain but don't let it fool you.  Attentive staff. Barely anyone there which is a surprise since it's has many wonderful items and the costs were cheap. Restroom is ok. Parking is limited because it's in a plaza with many other shops. Should still be able to get parking in the general area, but a bit of walk. It was a very cold evening so any distance is too far. It's a given, will be back & recommending it to everyone heading in that general area.",

Pros: -Really affordable -Delicious food of a good variety -Almond jello  Cons: None really, it delivers exactly what it promises.  This is my go to restaurant for cheap eats that taste great. The thin ribeye over pasta is really flavorful. The ribeye is really tender, the pasta has a good flavor and it's a simple dish. The Hoi Nam chicken is also very juicy. These are great dishes.  There is a huge selection here, and most of the other food is good. It isn't going to cast a spell on you but for the cost, you are getting good bang for buck. Try something that appeals to you. It may not suit you but I don't think you'll regret the adventure.  As for some comments on the service, I find it's really straightforward. I spoke with the owners once, they're from New York and have that vibe. I don't take it personal if they're a bit short. Part of their culture. I've never had a bad time here.",

The food was average, and service was okay. We had to grab some of our food from the kitchen area and clean off our tables on our own because our waiter barely served us. Granted, our waiter was the only waiter in the restaurant, and was also the host and bus boy. For this reason, we were lenient on our service expectations.   As far as food, we ordered the grilled eel, salt and pepper shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and thin ribeye. I would definitely recommend the eel because it comes with rice, bok choy, and soup. Salt and pepper shrimp was good but we had to peel it on our owns which was tedious. Won't recommend the thin ribeye. They also didn't have a soy sauce chicken when we came.   Overall, if you're looking for a quick decent bite to eat that is cheap in price, this is your place to go to.",

We were so tired from traveling that we didn't even bother to flag them down and too tired/lazy to go to a different food place. We chose this place because there was no line compared to all the other restaurants in the plaza.   Food ordered: Shrimp wonton: this was good! big wontons with big pieces of shrimp, fried to a nice crunch Shrimp wonton noodle soup: I'm a sucker for soup and the wontons were big. Soup was a little bit salty. Garlic Ong Choy: This was really good, the best thing that we ordered Salt and Pepper wings: VERY salty Beef Ramen soup: This was not good at all. Very disappointing. Hainan Chicken: This was the worst hainan chicken I've ever had. Even the ginger sauce I asked for was not good. I was so disappointed because this plate is one of my favorites and i'm not too hard to please. But it was VERY bland, and it was DRY and the actual sauce was tasteless as well.  It was very surprising because the reviews were so good for this place.  At the end, we ordered a sweet roti to go, which was quite tasty. Not too sweet and simple. I liked it.   I would not come here again, as we all ordered the most recommended and popular dishes recommended by the reviews here. We may have come at a bad time.  Not to mention that the service was extremely slow, a fast 45 minute dinner took eons. We just wanted to pay and leave!",

So the front guy pointed to a table for us to sit.   We sat down and he brought some waters for us. He gave us the menu and we looked at their options. There is a variety of the same stuff. It was a protein with a different sauce over rice.   My friend got a curry base dish and I got this dish with chicken and two dipping sauces.   There is definitely authenticity to the dish they make at this restaurant. The chicken had no flavor because you are supposed to dip it in the two sauces provided. The interesting thing is just lack of service. They didn't go around refilling the our waters.   I don't mind returning and trying other dishes just to explore; maybe I'm not ordering the right stuff. I'll update as I learn more about the restaurant. :)",

The funny thing is that we arrive to find that there was ample seating in a mom and pop establishment.  We were seated immediately.   Ambience was of a typical hole in a wall Chinese take out restaurant, entrees written in Chinese and English on paper taped to the wall, and cafeteria table and chairs.   Paul was our host and server.  Not super friendly, but not mean either.  He warmed up a tiny bit, but was pretty docile  Using my trusty yelp app, we ordered the following: (Rating is * = poor to ***** = awesome) ****Two orders of #21 salt and pepper chicken wings (8 pieces) ***#7 curry chicken over rice *** #15 beef ramen ****#31 salt and pepper fish (Paul's recommendation since I initially wanted the fried fish.) ***** Two orders of #19 fried shrimp wontons (10 pieces) **** Seasoned rice ***White rice *** Thai tea  Beverages came in styrofoam cups.  The coke my mommy ordered was a can.  She was happy about that bc she doesn't always trust soda fountains.   Food came in a timely manner.  We even ordered to go and they were pretty swift.

I no longer frequent this restaurant because of my last visit. The older gentleman that took our order was extremely friendly and our dishes came out quickly. I then noticed that he spilled something on the floor, cleaned it with paper towels, and then proceeded to grab food from the kitchen with the same gloves on to bring out to customers. To my surprise, he even boxed up our food for us with those same gloves on. We decided to just ask for the check and leave. Again, the money was handled with the same gloves on...  Later that night and the next day I had extremely bad stomach cramps and \"issues\".   It may have been something I ate earlier or it may have been from this visit to Big Wong's. But either way, I would rather not go to a place that doesn't practice cleanliness and proper hand hygiene. If they do this in plain view for all to see, I can't imagine how it is in the kitchen.",

The prices were super cheap...I was interested in the curry squid so we made a decision and ordered, then he asked \"are you Chinese?\" And then he recommended we not get that, he instead recommended the salt and pepper fish... So I got that and we also got the authentic curry chicken with the roti pancakes... Then we waited for our food and while waiting we got Thai coffee and that was really good. I've never tried it before, but I would order that again.  When we got home with our food we were very surprised at how delicious everything was. I said \"wow\" out loud and I'm not easily impressed. This is really something different and if you haven't tried this place out, you definitely should! I think this is a more traditional food rather than your Americanized Chinese menu....

Being raised in a Taiwanese household and spending my formative years in LA's second coming of Chinatown, Hacienda Heights, I had high expectations of this place.  Typical Asian hole in the wall joint.  No decor expected and menu items plastered all over the walls on bright colored paper.  Perfect.  We ordered the Hainam chicken (boneless dark meat), salt and pepper pork chop, and the ong choy in garlic sauce.  I'll say the food is pretty legit Taiwanese.  The veg was cooked to perfection with loads of garlic, my favorite.  The Hainam chicken was awesome, especially with their chili sauce and the seasoned rice.  The salt and pepper pork chop could have been a little crispier but was still quite tasty.    Quick service and no wait (we were there around 3pm), tasty authentic Taiwanese food, great prices...definitely going back.  I've got my eye on the pork and preserved egg congee next time.",

You even get a choice of dark/white meat either boneless or not. Common, with all the high prices in vegas, this place definitely saves your wallet.   The dish is served with season rice, spicy dipping sauce, soy sauce, and ginger (upon request). For an additional $0.75 you can get a nice steaming bowl of broth to go along with your meal. All this for under $6!  This sure beats out the $10+ meal i shell out for Pho at Pho Kim Long down the street. Can't wait to come back to try the other dishes.",

    "text": "What a disappointment!  With all the great things said about this place by people's whose reviews I respect, I thought it would be better than it was.  I just barely give 3 stars.  I was contemplating two and a half.  I was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.    The curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.  As I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.  I was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.  After waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.  I don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.  And as for dessert, I drove up Spring Mountain Road and stopped at McDonald's and had a McFlurry!  Better than her pudding I'd be willing to wager even sight unseen!",

They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side.

Nowhere can beat their price! Reason I only gave it 3 stars?? I am a foodie and I care about how food tastes more than its price. Their food comes in big portion but flavor is okay. \"Dungeness crab over rice noodles\" only serves by order in advance. You have to call in the morning and place order in advance. Then restaurant staff will buy fresh crab from market and do preparation before you come in. I gave it 3.5 stars in my opinion.",

We parked in front of Big Wong and joked that we would go here as our back up. We were so hungry and the wait at the ramen place would have been at least an hour, so we reluctantly came to Big Wong. Lo and behold, it was a GREAT decision. There was no wait and the food is delicious and fabulously priced. We ordered wonton soup, soy sauce chicken, and a few wonton soups with noodles. My only food critique was that the egg noodles we ordered with the wontons was undercooked and somewhat tough, not soft and elastic like it should be. Great portions and great prices. Fed my family of 5 for under $40 (including tip!). We were so satisfied that we came back AGAIN during our 4 day trip to Las Vegas. Plus, how can you not go to a place called Big Wong while in Vegas, right?",

We went in and there were only a few customers in there, but oh well we went pretty early on a weekday (about 6pm). The prices are the lowest for chinese food I have seen in the LV area. We ordered  a curry chicken pancake as appetizer, beef noodles, and wonton noodles. Of course we were way too greedy, we couldn't finish everything for the 2 of us (not to mention my husband also a mango pudding for dessert).  Everything taste great and the prices are too good to be True. The only disappointment is my husband wanted some taiwanese beef stew noodles and the one from big wong is not quite it (even though it tastes good).  The owners are very friendly and attentive. Big wong is a must go place if you want some cheap HK style food.",

When it came, it looks so fresh, i felt the crab' soul was still there and begging me not to eat it, but i did eat it. Taste very good. The curry beef was not bad but i felt that it missed something. i didnt know what it missed, dont ask me. I perfer u and me cafe's curry. and the dishes are very cheap. so it worth to try.",

    "text": "I can't really say that I'm a fan of this place from my first visit. But hey, it was a dollar, so I can't really complain. Even at their standard $4.95 prices, this turns out to be a decent stop for a quick lunch. Sure, it's nothing memorable, but it's got value on its side.  For starters, I ordered an regular iced tea to go with my meal. Disappointingly, it just turned out to be a canned Lipton Brisk tea. Not my usual forte; but then again, the meal was too cheap to make any complaints about. Service still remained to be prompt and friendly.  For the entree, I went with the chicken curry. It tasted a lot like my home cooking. You'd think that'd be complementary, but I am a terrible cook. In terms of flavors, it was average. But, it ended up being a filling meal. Don't count on waiting for your food, since it was practically served to me as quickly as the drink came out.  As I mentioned earlier, this place was nothing to write home about. I needed a quick lunch fix, and I got it for a good value. I will probably give it another go tomorrow for the last day of the $1 promotion. Maybe a better tasting dish will up my review to 4 stars.",

Wonton lovers, you won't be disappointed. :D    We also tried their fried pork chops served with a freshly made sauce,  excellent and their Roti (a sweet fried crepe Thai dessert) was to die for.  Owners were very friendly, prices very fair. Overall, this will be one of my favorite Vegas eats.",

I try to get in and out the door as quickly as possible, they got no love for the round eye.  update just got back worst service ever never going back they got my order wrong and they said I ordered wrong I know what I ordered!!! left because I didn't want to get my food spit on and dropped on the floor. never going back to these racists fucks",

In a move I was almost ashamed to make steps from Monta, I got the beef ramen.  It was as good as I've had anywhere.  The broth was delicious and the slow cooked beef was tender and delicious.  It was the first time I had beef tendon and I was pleasantly surprised.  We also got the curry dish with pancakes and that was very good as well.  Most of the dishes are around $5 and are very generous portions.  We were there when they were not busy and the staff was super friendly and helpful to us picking out dishes.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and even discovered a delicious type of chili sauce that they have on the tables that I have since purchased and use at home.  There was not much fault in our experience, but I have to mention that it smelled pretty bad in the dining room the night we were there.  Not joking, the restrooms smelled better than the dining room.  My wife wanted to walk out right away the smell was so strong.  Get that figured out and I'll go back.",

The  Chinese waiter wearing a big fluffy chef's hat did not say anything to us, until I said table for 3. He then pointed to a table, and tossed the menu onto the table. He did not say a word to us. Not even to say welcome to Big Wong's or what can I get you to drink. Not a word. My dad then ordered tea and water. The tea tasted was cold and tasted like dish water. Then my dad tried talking to the man in chinese, and he replied in a rude manner saying I don't speak chinese. And my dad also asked in english what number was the prata, and he said sharply and rudely #8 and my dad didn't like his tone and we walked out. Horrible service, Its more like BIG WRONG than BIG WONGs... WILL DEFINITELY NOT RETURN, AT LEAST NOT UNTIL THEY FIRE THE GUY!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Hey, if you're going to have a Wong, make it a big one, right?   The incentive to quality control this new eatery was that if you paid a dollar for your beverage (and mind you if you're reading this review 5/17/11-5/18/11 it's still going on), your entree was FREE!   No, that's not a typo, it's True. FREE. The three amigos ate for $3 dollars (plus tip) last night.   Newly remodeled with fresh yellow paint and ZERO items on the wall (perhaps not to distract from the food?), Big Wongs appeared to be clean and hoppin.   Seated at the very last table, conveniently located next to the hallway leading to the restrooms we placed our beverage order. Our canned soda's arrived in a timely fashion, unlike our food.   The number list of menu items was pretty small, but based on observation, I believe their is an \"off the menu\" option for things such as bok choy (which we found no where on the list). We chose our \"numbers\" and placed our order then commenced witty conversations amongst ourselves.   .............OK, so there's not enough time, or A.D.D. medication for me to input enough dots to represent the length of time we waited for our meals, but it was a while (*clears throat*, 40 minutes). We received our food, one dish at a time and about 5 to 15 minutes in between each other, but I would say despite the wait, the food was actually quite tasty!   I will give them a small exception that it was in fact their opening night and all, but common..Your menu is tiny, your items are numbered and the Restaurant seats about 10 tables MAX. Perhaps I'm being harsh but I don't see what the struggle to get food out in a timely fashion was all about..just sayin.   OK, OK, enough of that. The food itself was very delicious and everything on the featured menu is UNDER $5!!! Yes folks, that's right, UNDER $5.00!!   Would I eat there again? Sure. Would I go out of my way to get there, bring anyone there, or recommend it? Prolly not.",

The noodles came with soup in a big bowl. They just opened so everything is clean. Service was pretty fast considering there was a bunch of meal there. I placed my order went to wash my hand in the restroom, got back all our plates were there. they did have a long line out side but its because there wasn't a waiting area inside wait, just put ur name on the list and waited 15 mins checked the other stores around so it was quick. I think today is the last day for their special so ill probably go there and try something else. Meals regular are about $4.95.",

We had tickets for Love so we had to find a place to eat and fast.  My Mom Yelped this place and suggested we give it a try.  I'm super happy that we did.   They had a short menu.  But I can understand that - just have a few things on the menu and get it right.  Everything we ordered tasted great.  I ordered the Hainanese chicken rice.  I've traveled to Singapore and had chicken rice at chatterbox among other hawker stores.  In the US, we just don't have the chickens like they do in Asia.  Big Wong did a good job at sending me back there.  The chicken skin had a nice crisp.  The rice was super flavorful just like S'pore, they used the same authentic hot sauce, and the plate even came with cucumber slices.  The kids got the roti and chicken curry.  The roti was great and the sauce robust.  The roti was so good we ordered an extra order of it.  But with these kinds of prices you can splurge like crazy and still come out spending comparable to a cheap fast food joint.    When I got back, I was telling my co-workers about this place.  I mean at Mickey D's you can get 20 pieces of nuggets or come here and get some home cooked ramen noodles - I think the choice is a no brainer.    The place is super clean serving up the honest, good food.  Next time I'm coming to Vegas I'm sure to make a stop here!",

That's probably how they keep their prices insanely low.  Almost every dish was under $5.  My group of 10 ordered at least 2 dishes per person and everything was delivered in a timely manner.    Highlights   - Get the salt and pepper chicken wings.  Best I've ever had.  Seasoned and fried perfectly with thinly sliced peppers.  I could eat these all day.    - Hoi Nam Chicken with chicken rice.  Love you can choose dark or white meat.  Great dipping sauces.  The rice is sooo good.  Make sure to ask for ginger sauce too.    - Thin Rib Eye - Thin cuts of rib eye with dipping sauce (like teriyaki, but not as sweet?) and potatoes.  I don't know if this is Chinese, but it was good.  If I were to do it again, I would probably go for the thick rib eye.  - Roti w/ Curry Chicken - Tasty roti, but wish the curry was a bit thicker.  Big chunks of chicken in the curry  - Surprisingly good Thai iced tea.  We over-ordered for 10 people, the bill still came out to $90.  I wish I had a Big Wong's in Seattle.

    "text": "Whenever I'm in Vegas & I want a filling cheap eat, Big Wong is one of my favorite places to go.  Big Wong serves the type of food your grandparents and parents cook for you growing up in a Chinese household. The food is not super fancy, but it's the type of food that's comforting and nostalgic to have.   Some of my favorite things that they offer here include: - Chicken curry with Roti: if you haven't had roti yet, you're missing out. Roti is flaky and soft in the middle, but has a crisp surface. Dip your roti in curry (or even condensed milk if you wanna have some dessert) & it's seriously bomb. The chicken curry here has mild spice too, for those who can't handle spicy.  - Hainan Chicken: for $7, this is SUCH a good deal. I personally prefer dark meat, so I always get the Hainan Chicken & Rice w/ only dark meat. The chicken is honestly not super flavorful, so it's great that they include dipping sauces for it. However, the rice is yummy, as it's got some of that broth flavor alongside with some ginger.  - Fried chicken wings: delicious! It came out piping hot, fresh, & the meat was super juicy!! Sometimes I get annoyed at places that fry their wings and the meat becomes super tough to eat & dry, but they definitely fry it right here!  Customer Service: pretty quick and minimal interactions with the server (he'll take your order & refill waters as needed but he won't be trying to chat that much with you in my experience)   There's plenty more that you can try and can't go wrong with here, but of the times I've been here (basically go at least 1-2x when I'm in Vegas), I just stick to these basics & have been very content. Thank goodness for small cheap eats off the strip!",

    "text": "Great hole in the wall spot for Chinese food in the heart of Las Vegas.  The prices for dishes can't be beat anywhere in the city and portions are a good amount for family style dining.  Big Wong has a great selection of dishes for every palette.  My usual go to dishes include the salt and pepper shrimp, chicken curry over rice, Ong Choi garlic or Thai style (when in season usually summer).  They're also known for the beef noodle soup that you can customize with types of noodles including thick white rice noodles or egg noodles.  Sometimes I like to add the tendon to the beef ramen but it's personal preference as the texture is very jelly like.  The roti pancakes are very tasty so I recommend those first time out.  Very clean restaurant with a casual vibe.  Parking is a pain sometimes in the plaza but you can always park across the street and walk over.",

The prices are affordable and flavors are always consistent.    If you are looking for a cheap Chinese restaurant with an americanized menu - you won't find it here.   There is no fried rice on the menu.    First timers, try the salt and pepper wings,  fried shrimp wontons and get there early for the soy chicken... there's a limited amount made daily.    Dinner time gets busy but you can opt for take out. I found this place in 2012 amd have been coming here almost weekly ever since.    If you're on a budget but still want to get full,  this is where you want to be.   But please don't come in and expect fast service.   There's usually one person waiting tables so patience is the key,  but its totally worth it.",

You don't come here for atmosphere or service or for an \"authentic\" dining experience but you do come here for Asian comfort food and Big Wongs cheap cheap prices.   I think everything on their menu is 10 dollars or less. They have preserved egg and salted pork congee for 4 bucks, lots of chicken and pork dishes for 5, and sliced ribeye and seafood dishes for 10. Their portions are huge!  I ordered the deep fried pork and it came in two plates!  Pork was crispy and delicious. The egg that was served was cook Japanese style where it's soft boiled so the yolk is still creamy on the inside.  My friend ordered the hai nam chicken. Again huge portions. I think she got at least 1/4 of a chicken. I love the sauces that come with this dish and the garlicky rice is sooo satisfying.   This place accepts credit cards too, which is hard to find at places when the total bill comes out to be $10. Will definitely come back for good cheap food. The guy who served is was also very nice and refilled our water cups without even asking. :)",

Crunchy and deep fried, it's almost impossible to screw this up. These tasted great with the sweet chili sauce.   We also requested the stir fry bok choy. This ties with the fried wontons as being my favorite item. I loved the strong garlic flavor and aroma.    Thin Rib Eye Over Rice was another dish we shared. This was pallid with dark grill marks (how does this happen?!) For a rib eye supposedly cooked at medium rare, it was surprisingly dry.  I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Soup with Noodles as my main meal. I liked the wontons, noodles, and Chinese broccoli. As for the broth, not so much; it was bland.  Lastly, service was peculiar. When I asked our server if the food was large enough to share between two people, he told me to look at what the other patrons were eating (nope, not going to be a weirdo). Once all of our food was delivered, he never returned.   On the upside, I'd say the the majority of the food on the menu is affordable, and the restaurant stays open until the early morning hours.",

Everything we had was so good. The beef in my ramen was so tender & I've never had better wontons in my soup. The seafood noodle soup was also delicious but I wasn't a fan of the big fish balls! But the broth was so flavorful & there was a variety of other seafood in there as well. I was super impressed with the ribeye over Noodles. The sauce they serve with it on the side was so good, it pulled the noodles & ribeye together into the perfect bite. We weren't expecting such a big plate of food since the price was quite low, but I would have been full if I ate the ribeye over noodles on my own! But together we finished everything & loved every bite!",

In short, things just don't taste fresh, and they aren't Chinese ENOUGH.   Salt and pepper chicken wings that people rave about? They're okay. Coming out of the fryer sizzling hot, they do taste good, but nothing about them makes them great. They lack a fresh element. Everything here appears that it can be purchased and stored in bulk via freezer or dry storage.   Ordered the beef \"ramen,\" which was overly cinnamon-y in flavor and lacking of anything else, including any sort of vegetable or garnish. Even a toss of chopped cilantro could have spruced this plain dish up some, but instead it's just one note and unenjoyable to eat.  Staff was quite angry at each other. Angry, passive-aggressive Chinese guy cooking needs to NOT yell at the woman working front of house. I can understand all of it, and no one else certainly needs to speak Chinese to understand that you're yelling at someone else that you work with.  All in all, a no-go from this Chinese chica.",

The waiter brought out styrofoam cups with ice water, which made me question why the restaurant didn't use reusable cups. I ordered the hoi nam chicken without bone and with rice. The food came out quick, and was good. I liked their sauces. The waiter was friendly.  While I was eating my food, all I could hear was the older guy in the kitchen yelling at the staff/waiter asking if a order is ready or if something is made yet. Everyone and everything seemed rushed, even when the lady took our order, she had an attitude when my mom asked her a question about what kind of noodles they used for a specific dish.   Overall, I would recommend this inexpensive restaurant despite the rushing and bad attitude.",

Most restaurants in NY is good. Some in California is good. Vegas if GOD AWFUL.  All the head chefs in Vegas are the untalented sioux chefs from the real restaurants in NY or LA.  This is FACT not a rumor. Anyone who says otherwise has never tasted what real standards are and also give \"in N out burger\" 5 stars.  Big Wong's is a hole in the wall but its cheaper and actually does taste better than 95% of all the other restaurants in Chinatown. Its a super casual honk kong style wonton noodle joint. Its real Chinese fast food, and the food is FAST. So if you want service, HOLLAR.  What's rude in the US is normal in a cheap place.  Its supposed to be informal, noisy, WTF do you want, Don't waste my time, attitude.  You're not paying top dollar and they don't expect huge tips, so don't get annoyed, get loud, and get service.  The Hainan chicken rice dishes are good. The cheap rib eye is decent. Shrimp noodle is very flavourful. Curry is a unique traditional style.  Its not thai or indian or malaysian. I can't explain it, but their curry is different,  its not bad, its just different. It's not coconut based.  Remember,  this place is a Hong Kong style fast food noodle joint. It's not comparable to other Chinese joints.",

The first time we came to this lovely establishment we were the only ones there and were given a half-assed, curt as hell greeting and the chef threw our menus on the table. Thinking he just had a bad day, we thought nothing of it and continued to order. Food was decent but the customer service gave us a sinking feeling in our stomachs (not unlike incessant gas)  We then decided to come back, craving some curry, however, the chef decided to up his petty ass game and decided to give not only waters to the three tables of ~6 people but also took their orders even though they came in about 10 minutes after us.  We decided to leave and as we exited, we heard the chef laugh.   This came as a surprise seeing as I, an obvious Asian, frequented this place nearly every day with my ASIAN FAMILY and were treated with utmost respect and even with occasional jokes from the chef.   Honestly, I hate playing the race card but my party wasn't 100% Asian. We were the only group comprised of non-asians and it was blatantly obvious that we were treated differently.   If y'all want some quality food, just go across the plaza to Japanese Zen Curry. We were seated immediately and enjoyed the great customer service that made us feel welcomed and the entire place has a 10/10 vibe.   tl;dr: if you're not Asian, don't.",

At the last two years, I have referred many friends, families and the people I know to them! Come here for dinner after my last visit two years ago and I guess thing does change after time! The parking lot is very busy. Very hard to find a parking 6 o'clock at the evening. This should be a good sign. Finally found a parking spot just in front of the restaurant. The first thing I saw is they have one table with two customer eating only. All the cars in the parking lot is for the other restaurants in the same parking lot! I normally knew this is no good! But because the good experience two years ago. I still designed to eat here. Big mistake! The service is bad! Very bad! The waiter (I think he is the owner) is very rude. When he come to my table to take the order. He want the numbers only. So I needs to look for the numbers on the menu. Instead wait for a second, he just walk away and not come back for a long time. I should be leave at this point. But because the foods was good two years ago. I convinced myself he is just too busy. Okay, we order a congee and a beef tender noodle. This is the worst foods I have in Vegas! The congee is look like mixing rice and water, no favors at all! The noodle is also so bad, the noodle is so soft, the soup is tasty like water. The beef is boiling by water. Time is very changing this at one time one of the best restaurant in Vegas for me. I will not come back or referring any business to them anymore!",

    "text": "Big Wong: not to be confused with Big Wong King, Big Wang's Sports Bar or Lucky Chengs Drag Queen Cabaret - My pal Chan wanted to throw together a little UYE (unofficial yelp event) at Big Wong's; but in his message to me, it indicated we should eat at: his Big Wong? Hahahaha. I died of laughter. Good thing I've had \"Big Wong\" on the radar so our miscommunication was short lived and our friendship was spared.  The UYE was a success and of course, we over-ordered: have you seen those prices!?! The restaurant is a small, unassuming, very hole-in-the-wall, but tidy Chinese spot located in the prime of Chinatown near the likes of Kung Fu Tea (my go-to Boba shop) and other heavy food-hitters like Raku and Curry House Zen.  I ordered a nice dinner-sized portion of (Hai Nam or Hoi Nam on their menu) chicken rice and it was only $4.95! Other known as Hainanese chicken rice, the chicken is poached and then the rich stock cooks and gives aromatic flavor to the rice. Here you can choose between all white meat, dark meat without bone, or dark meat with bone. I went for the dark meat without bone and it was pretty legit. The chicken was plentiful, very moist and the dark meat had lots of flavor. I felt that the rice could have used a little bit more seasoning and aromatic flavor, though the 2 dipping sauces made up for it. There was a slightly sweet, dark soy sauce and also a reddish ginger sauce - that was my favorite. The ginger was extremely aromatic and gave the chicken a lot of freshness and pops of character. Flavor rating: 4/5  We also tried: Garlic steamed bok choy - very good! The steamed bok choy, still had a slight bite to them and soaked up a lot flavor from all of the garlic bits. Flavor rating: 5/5  Shrimp and wonton noodle soup - We felt that this noodle soup was average. The wontons committed the worst offense: not enough filling. Don't skimp! The egg noodles were abundant and cooked al dente and the broth was simple, but decent. The whole shrimp also had a strange, off-putting mealy texture to them. Flavor rating: 2/5  Ribs in Black Bean sauce - the meat was tender but overall flavor was muted so we weren't too sure what to make of the black bean sauce? This was our least favorite dish. Flavor rating: 2/5  Roti with curry $4.95 - Malaysian style crispy and buttery flat bread/ pancake that is served glistening, crisp and hot. The curry had lovely spices and a tad bit of heat. Plus, they did not skimp on the chicken and potatoes - there were huge chunks in the bowl. Flavor rating: 4/5  The crispy Roti pancakes were my favorite and truly the best I've ever had. They are super flaky, not too oily, and had an extremely addictive butter flavor that almost tasted like a buttery croissant! Flavor rating: 5/5  Big Wong is doing something different in Vegas; keeping it homey, keeping it simple, keeping it affordable. This New York style Chinese joint is a welcome addition to our diverse Las Vegas Chinatown!",

    "text": "I give this place 4 stars because whenever I'm here with a party, we get pretty loud and the workers or other customers haven't complaint once. I'm telling you, this place has a very chill atmosphere. You don't feel like you have to rush when eating here.   If you're ever driving down spring mountain with friends and thinking of where to eat for comfort, stop by at this place! The food selection is inexpensive and the portions are fairly decent. They have everything from salt and pepper chicken wings that's crispy, fried shrimp wontons (about 9 on a plate), stir fry baby bok choy, seasoned rice and chicken dishes, and soups! Your orders would take about 10-20 minutes. The only down side is most of the time, I feel that the one taking the check, getting orders, and cooking is the same person because he's all I see on the floor.   When you order the salt and pepper pork, they give you a lot!! Like a mountain of sliced fried pork with the sauce and don't forget your side of rice.   Also, don't be hesitant to ask for green onion or sirrarcha for flavor especially on your soup and noodles.   $10 will get you full.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for this place based on the 4 star review.  I ordered takeout and the food came out quickly and was so nicely packaged.  As I was waiting for my food, I read another yelper say that the soup for the wonton was unusually sweet. They were so right!  It was oddly sweet, but lacking flavor at the same time.  The noodles and wonton tasted like cardboard.  It was bizarre.  I literally poked one of the wontons and it deflated.  When I bit into it, the wonton skin was almost leathery.  It was as though the wontons were freezer burned and super old.  All the other dishes were equally bland.  So unfortunate.  They need a new chef.  The garlic Chinese broccoli stir fry was good though.  That was all I enjoyed.",

    "text": "I have never given a 3-star review until now and hold on, I can explain.  After a long 13 hour drive from Colorado, I wanted real food. No more beef jerky or gas station hot dogs (nothing against gas station hot dogs because they're not that bad). I was craving a nice bowl of noodle soup and after an intense 20 mins searching for a Chinese restaurant on Yelp, I came across Big Wong Restaurant. I skimmed the menu and the pictures and I knew exactly what I wanted when I got there: a shrimp wonton noodle soup bowl.  To keep this easier to understand, I am just going to list the good and the not so good: Good  - I got my food within 5 minutes of ordering which I was happily surprised about because I was super hungry  - There was a good amount of wontons and shrimps  - The flat rice noodles were cooked right and there was a decent amount  Not so good  - The soup was too sweet and it wasn't a seafood type of sweet, but more like a pack of sugar that you'd put in your coffee type of sweet  Now I know you are probably wondering why I am giving this place a 3-star when there is only one not so good thing about my bowl of noodle soup. I truly believe the broth is the most important aspect of a bowl of noodle soup and if the broth is not done right then the rest of the stuff in the bowl does not matter. I enjoy eating my noodles with the soup together and I could not really do that with this bowl. Even when I am super full, I always finish the broth at every restaurant that I order a bowl of noodle soup at and I could not do that at Big Wong Restaurant.  The service was fine. The lady asked us how many people we had when we got there and she took the menus and walked over to a table and my family just stood there because normally the server would ask us to come and so we were kind of thrown off when she walked off without saying anything. When we left, my mother said bye to her and she did not say anything back or even looked at her. She was talking to another customer at the front desk so she may not have heard her but a quick glance of recognition would have sufficed.  Overall Score: Price - 5/5 Taste - 3/5 Service - 3/5 Quality of ingredients - 4/5 Portion size - 4/5 Restroom - 4/5  I am 100% sure that Big Wong Restaurant has better tasting items on the menu, but the shrimp wonton noodle soup was just okay to me. The service was fine but you do get your food pretty quickly if the place is not packed.  *NOTE* This is an authentic Chinese restaurant so if you are looking for sesame chicken or General Tsao's chicken, please go to Panda Express or PF Chang's. Half of the 1-star reviews are most likely those who misread Big Wong Restaurant as the two Americanized Chinese places that I mentioned.",

Rice had good flavor, chicken was not dry, and the sauce was a good compliment.  The Miscellaneous The restaurant is in a plaza amongst others, it has a private lot but gets packed during peak hours. The restaurant is average sized with good amount of seating. The interior is like a typical Chinese restaurant, but their restroom was very clean. It was pretty empty during dinner hours, but might be because peak hours are at a different time? The service was pretty quick and employees seem pretty nice. They have a decent selection of dishes on their menu, focusing mainly on rice, noodle, and curry it seems. This was a good first experience of Asian food in Las Vegas.",

I just read that the owner or the cook or somebody had passed away from when they originally opened. I'm sad that he passed bcuz we had been coming here since almost the start of their restaurant before they had reviews and awards given to them. I'm sad to say that the standards may have fallen since then. The chicken we ordered was unfortunately dry and seemed like it was over cooked. That has never happened to us since coming here ever. We ordered 4 orders of the same chicken. I hope the standards have not gone down but I will warn people that my hainan dark chicken was dry and over cooked. I'm gonna give it another chance eventually but I'm hesitant to recommend this place now. Wait for my update.....",

    "text": "Big Wong...more like Big Right! We were hungry for some real Asian food after visiting the Mob Museum (which is also a 5 star experience), so we looked through Yelp to find our way and this restaurant with the headline name and favorable review caught our attention. We headed over there into this small shopping center to find this underwhelming looking yet clean restaurant. The first sign we knew this place was going to be awesome was the menu. It was small and handy and got right to the point. We ordered enough food for lunch and dinner along with four orders of dessert (mango and almond jelly were so yummy!).   This is what I remembered ordering: Three Treasures Rice Curry Fish Balls Curry Beef Over Rice (spicy) Shrimp Wonton and Fish Ball with Noodle Soup Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Rice Stir-fry Ong Choy    Next time we're back, we want to try the Roti since we found it interesting to have this Indian bread on a mostly Chinese menu. All the food we tried were delicious and affordable, and we also got great customer service. You can't go \"Wong\" at Big Wong Restaurant!",

I ate the wholeeeeeee thing BEFORE going to dayclub. No regrets. :) Although the chicken was probably only delicious with the orange ginger sauce, the seasoned rice had me coming back for more.... probably because it was full of chicken fat and other goodness.  I cannot say the same for the Salt and Pepper Fish. They were SOGGY, limp pieces of fish. I will be back for the rice...*drooling just thinking about it*",

Food came out in less than 15 minutes and our server Jimmy was helpful and attentive. Between the depth of the soup broth, the subtle seasoning and flavors in the perfectly steamed rice and the tenderness of the salted chicken, everything was awesome.

    "text": "Big Wong's in Las Vegas has no relation at all to Big Wong's in NYC.  It piqued my interest solely because of the Big Wong's I'm familiar with Manhattan's Chinatown.   This place only lives up to 50% of its value proposition.  Let me explain:   - I ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice.  I liked the rice, but not the chicken. - I ordered the shrimp wonton soup.  I liked the wontons, but not the soup. - The food is pretty inexpensive, but food is pretty mediocre.   Get it?    Hainanese Chicken Rice - The rice was really good. Well mildly flavored from the chicken and not overly spiked with ginger, which can be common.  The chicken, on the other hand...Not.  Over cooked with a coarse texture.  Not at all moist like Hainanese chicken should be, whether it be a Thai, Singapore, or Cantonese, etc. version.  Also, I had to ask for the ginger and oil condiment that usually accompanies Hainanese Chicken Rice, but it was served as just plain minced ginger.  No oil or anything.  Very strange.  As many times as I've had it everywhere, they always serve it with the traditional ginger, oil and green onion mixture.    Shrimp Wontons - Pretty good and plentiful dish with generous portion of fresh Chinese greens.  I was craving wontons, so this satiated my craving.  The soup, not so much.  I'm not sure if it was made from an instant mix, or just poorly made.  I didn't drink any of it!  It also had some strange sweetness to it, that I've never ever had in wonton soup.    As you can see, my experience with the food was less than something to write home about.  However, the inexpensive price tag of the meal was impressive.  Literally $14.00 before tax for both dishes, which is a steal by Bay Area standards.  In fact, that's what lured me into getting both of these dishes for just myself.  So, sometimes cheap doesn't lead to good things.  After all, did I really need two of these dishes for lunch?  Answer to that question is a definitive \"no\", especially when I really only enjoyed 50% of it at every turn.",

I recognize when walking in that I was here before on my countless trips to Vegas back when I came for nearly every UFC event from 2007-2012.   I came here with a Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity member I had not seen in over 22 years. He moved to Vegas so I looked him up and both found time to meet for lunch.   We got:   beef noodle soup with tendon $7.50 (the beef could have been cooked longer to make it more tender. It was leathery. The tendon was good. Noodles were ramen variety)   hoi nam chicken with seasoned rice $6.50 (Chicken was not served with garlic sauce that is traditional. I guess I didn't request it. It comes with 2 different types of sauces. It was ok. Small pieces and it was slightly warm. It should be served traditionally COLD. The seasoned rice was great though.)   salt and pepper fish $9.50 (tasty, light batter and perfect seasoning)  Overall, pretty good quick eats and reasonable prices. I would definitely come back when in Vegas. The menu is pretty extensive with congees (porridge for the gai lows :-)), noodles, noodles soups, rice dishes, curry, wonton soups and many other options.   Want to fill up on the cheap with solid Chinese food? This would be it. Not 100% authentic on all items, esp. the Hoi Nam Chicken, but pretty authentic on many of the menu items. It is in a small strip mall with ground level and upper level businesses. This one is on the lower level. Easy parking. Give it a shot my fellow Yelpsters!",

You could spend more and get far less at any fast food restaurant.  I got the Hai Nam chicken and my wife for the shrimp soup with udon.  Both were very tasty and filling.  We finished up our meal splitting an almond jello dessert for a whopping bill of $11.20.  Great, friendly service too.  The staff knew a lot of the guys in the group by name.  The owner came in to say hello and gave us a few plates of shrimp wonton appetizers on the house.  There were so many other dishes that looked great.

But that did not make up for the runs I had after consuming 3/4 of the bowl...  The won ton egg noodle soup was the most bland I've ever had - and I had pretty high expectations since this is rated 4 stars on Yelp - disappointing. Everything was subpar except for the shrimp won tons.  If you're looking for dirt cheap food and don't care about the quality, then this is your place. There are definitely other places nearby that serve much better quality and authentic food.   I can't believe how highly this is rated... maybe it's the noodle soups that suck.",

    "text": "Cheap and super fast delicious food.   I wanted to try this place because everyone was raving about how cheap and delicious they are-- and it is SO True.   I tried the chicken curry with roti (4.95) the flaky roti was so delicious and it had been exactly what I had been craving for, since I haven't had roti in a long time.   I also ordered the chicken on seasoned rice, to my delight, the chicken was steamed and seasoned rice was so addicting. They also place 2 sauces on the side, a soy sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. ($4.95) I was happy because this seemed like a healthy choice on the menu.   Since it's not too far from UNLV, this place makes a great place for the po' college student. I wish I knew about this place when I was goin to school.",

    "text": "First thing: They just have really darkly tinted windows, but hop right in! They're open! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Commitment to fresh and good-quality ingredients, low-priced meals, nice plastic containers (New York style), and most dishes for only five dollars with tax included wins Big Wong's five stars.  I  first came during their dollar extravaganza days, tried their chicken roti, hoi nam chicken, beef ramen, wonton soup, and have since those days gone back about three different times. They do most things quite well, and probably do most things best in Las Vegas.  They are a cafe different from KJ's Kitchen, Wendy's Cafe and U&Me Cafe. Different doesn't mean better. Different just means different.   I enjoyed their salt and pepper chicken wings. I heard from the owner that his recipe is 25-30 years old. The skin is very crispy, and the chili slices add much flavor to the skin. But to be fair, how can you go wrong with chicken wings and salt and pepper?  My favorite dish is the curry chicken roti. The day that I went, they ran out of curry chicken, but they let me do the beef curry and just pay $1.50 more for extra roti. It was so delicious! The curry is not too thin or thick, just the right texture for you to dip your roti. The chicken is tender and moist, even beneath the curry.  Another notable offering they have is the fried wonton. The shrimp inside was so juicy, the skin outside was so crisp, and everything just worked so well together with the tangy sauce.   The hoi nam chicken can come on the bone or deboned with dark meat or white meat, so it's up to you to choose. We got dark meat on the bone, but have also tried boneless. It comes with no extra sauce. The rice is pretty good. I'd have to say that my favorite Hainan (Hoi Nam) chicken rice is still from Savoy in Alhambra, CA. However, in Las Vegas, this is a pretty good version. U&Me Cafe also has an okay version.  Definitely, when you're done with your meal, order their mango or almond jello. I have tried both. The jellos are extravagance in a cup. There's real fruit inside of the jello cup, and it looks so simple, but if you really think about it, the flavor pairings are simply culinary genius: real longan inside of almond jello. Mm... yum!  My favorite thing about Big Wong's is that the chef really prides himself in not compromising in quality for quantity. He provides both those things.   Service is great. Connie is very quick to take your order, and quick to deliver your food. I believe another waitress, Winnie, is also there and she helps to run food as well.  This place is great for large groups, couples, or for a quick solo lunch. Prices are so affordable, that I can go back again and again without my wallet hurting, unlike its surrounding restaurants.",

    "text": "Big Wong is one of the best ways to get a $4.95 lunch in Vegas.  Most of the menu is $5.00 and under.   Price. Price. Price.  If that's what drives you come here.   I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with udon noodle. I found the broth to be too lightly flavored, but there was plenty of shrimp packed wontons and noodles to fill up.   None of the food at our table was spectacular, but all of the dishes were fine.  I may have judged this place too harshly, but it's hard to eat mediocre food when the best ramen in Vegas (Monta Ramen) and one of the best Japanese restaurants (Raku) are in the same shopping center for only a few dollars more.  I will certainly try Big Wong again and try not to dream of tonkatsu ramen.",

That would be enough for me to turn around and show myself out, but I remembered how good the food was the last time. Instead of turning heel, I sat in the corner table upfront. 10 minutes pass, no one came in. I really had this place to myself. Out comes my beef ramen with tendon and I questioned why it was dead at 4:30 on a Thursday.   The beef was plentiful, tender, juicy, large chunks. The tendon were melt in your mouth good. There were double takes to make sure I was not devouring colossal pieces of fat. The noodles had more of a chew than my tendons. Take that as a compliment, because there is nothing worst than over cooked noodles. These had the perfect bite. The broth is simple and flavorful. Sriracha and green onions are the condiments provided and that was enough flavor to get me to pick up the bowl and slurp down every last drop. I ended my meal with a mango pudding. The bits of mango floating within was a nice touch.  Now let me go all Rachel Ray on everybody; Beef Ramen $5.95, Mango Pudding $1.25, and tip=$10. That is a meal that is easy on the wallet.  The waitress is very soft spoken and meek. With that being said, she was extremely nice, very unlike other Chinese restaurants.",

This is owned by a Thai & Chinese couple...from what I can gather.   My bf overheard the main chef talking (big Wong) and that's how we started talking to them and finding out more info.

Yeah, we're here so often that we might as well be considered locals. Heck, ask my sisters for directions and she can point you in the precise direction.   I'm going to  just come out and say that I'm not exactly a big fan of Big Wong in terms of food. Everytime, the food just looks so darn appetizing. And then I bite into it and am filled with disappointment. I'm not a fan of the Hoi nam chicken, the pork chop with rice, and the ribeye with pasta. The Hoi nam chicken is underseasoned (but the sauces and the rice are delicious), the pork chop can be more crispy, and the sauce that is supposed to go with the pasta provides no taste for the pasta. So yeah, there is a huge lack of flavor sometimes.   So why 4 stars? Lord, the prices. Most of the dishes are $4.95. Yes. There is still a place in Las Vegas you can eat for $5 that does not consist of In-n-out or tiny slices of pizza. Despite my less than stellar experience with the foods previously listed, there are some standout dishes that you should definitely try. The chicken wings are superb. the ribeye is actually pretty good and I usually just order that and take the noodles to go (then douse it with something else), the sizzling plate veggies are amazing (ask the old Asian guy who does everything for it!), the shrimp wontons hit the right spot, and the beef ramen is a combination of college dorm life and fancy gourmet ramen shop. You are guaranteed to leave STUFFED.  Just a warning though. Don't come here and expect perfect customer service. This is a Chinese restaurant son! The one guy who does it all, the old Asian guy with the white hat, doesn't smile (unless you have a giggling baby in your arms), and doesn't speak Chinese. Expect comfort food at insanely cheap prices and you'll leave a happy customer.   The parking also sucks because Big Wong shares the same parking lot with Vegas favorites, Kung Fu Tea and Monta Ramen. Be patient and if that doesn't work out, there's a deserted furniture store to the left of Big Wong's. Take the risk and park there if you want. We haven't had any problems but you never know.",

The service wise was okay...The restaurant is Chinese, so you get Chinese service (where they service your order and food fast, and without a smile or anything nice).

    "text": "I think I am addicted to Big Wong.  After moving to Vegas I was initially turned off by the silly name.  I didn't think that a restaurant named Big Wong would serve good food.  Boy was I wrong.  My friends went here and told me that the food was legit and the prices were amazing.  After finally giving it a taste, I came back 3 days in a row.    Getting full off of a $5 meal?!?  ADDICTED!  Here are the dishes I tried:  1.  Thin rib eye over rice $4.95 - Thinly sliced rib eye is served with yummy dipping sauce.  The rice comes on a separate plate and comes with some steamed potato slices.  A great deal for rib eye!  2.  Steamed chicken, mushrooms, chinese sausage, and vegetables $5.95 - There are a lot of components to this dish that kept me from getting bored.  The chicken is served in a bowl of broth separately from the sausage, rice, and veggies.  Pour it over your rice to get some soupy chicken rice.  Gotta love the lop chong (spelling?) - 5th generation Chinese, I apologize.  3.  Hoi nam chicken (dark meat, boneless) $4.95 - Excellent!  Soft steamed chicken without any bones.  Comes with the yummy flavored rice and 2 dipping sauces.  A soy based sauce and a red spicy one.    4.  Salt and pepper chicken wings $4.95 - I love the saltiness of this one.  Tiny jalepenos are sprinkled on top as well.  Great appetizer to share with the group.  5.  Salt and pepper pork $4.95 - Thin slices of pork deep fried and then sliced.  Very similar to the salt and pepper wings but a little less salty.  I prefer the chicken wings.  6.  Beef ramen $5.95 - Ok.  Cantonese style beef ramen with all the tendon and chunks that you can ask for.  Not my thang personally.  7.  Mango pudding $1.25 - So good!  A great way to end your super cheap meal, with a super cheap dessert!  Chunks of mango are actually in the cup too :D  8.  Sweet roti $1.25? - A thin roti or bread thingy with condensed milk, powdered sugar, and other sweet goodness on top.  Gotta try it at least once.  Other random tid-bits: They always give you extra scallions in a metal tin. Easy parking. Cheap everything.  Tax is included in the price on the menu! Mom and pop store.  The wife is the server and her husband is the chef.  He wears a giant chef hat too!  Definitely recommend to anyone who is in Vegas in search of some good cheap food!  Cheaper than Earl of Sandwich haha.",

FYI, it means good business or being prosperous. \"big wong\" is actually MISTA LEE. lol. good people :) - Smells like raw eggs upon entering. goes away tho. you adapt the asian smell. - No bone! easy eats for shovelers. pork chop cut in small pieces.  - Chicken curry was great. comes with chopped potatoes. Not golden curry brand. where the carrots at tho? - pancake tasted like a crepe! crispy! sweet! delicious! must get! 1.25! the price of a gum. BIG JUICE! probably less! - Almond pudding was also a hit. 3 lychees tho. not bad. - service is a bit slow. waterless for awhile. i get thirsty -___-. where my pork chop? - Ms Lee takes pictures! - So cheap! AYCE got nothin on this",

My favorite dishes include #1 hai nam chicken, steamed chicken with chinese sausage or curry chicken. Most things on menu is under $6 and the food is amazing. The hai nam chicken #1 is the best after a good workout gives my body the protein it desires! My favorite place, travel from Aliante every chance I get to eat here! :)",

We ordered the salt and pepper wings which were sooo juicy and crispy for appetizer and then had chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, white meat chicken and rib eye. The chicken was a little bit too dry for me but the rib eye and the broccoli was superb. The prices are unbelievably cheap. Our bill was $23 and that was with thai coffee.",

The curry has just that right amount of spice to kick up the favors. I didn't think I would like rice patty's with my curry but this placed changed my mind. I can't eat curry without rice patty's anymore. It's just too beautiful. Only grip about this place is that its not open later, if it stayed open till like late night (drunk) hours then this place would be rolling in the money. Check this place out and try that curry and let me know if its as good as I make it seem.",

    "text": "Talk about cheap with a Capital C. In a town where you have to pay a premium for anything you get, this place is certainly the exception. What's even better than cheap food? Tasty cheap food. With most items on the menu at $5.95 and under, you can't beat it. I'm not sure if it's Mr. Big Wong taking our order, but he certainly looked like the owner. Some of my favorite items we've tried were the chicken curry with roti, fried wontons, salt and pepper chicken wings, and hainan chicken. The chicken curry more Malaysian style rather than Chinese style.  Overall if you are looking for an affordable and tasty place in Vegas to grab a quick bite in between your gambling sessions, this place is it. The only problem you might run into is the parking. While the lot is decent sized, there are so many other restaurants packed in this strip mall that parking could get difficult during peak meal times. I will definitely be back to this Vegas gem.",

But look, if you want something hearty, yummy, and cheap, it's like... as good as it gets (assuming you want Chinese food lol).  We arrived to Vegas during our recent trip pretty late (a story in itself) and missed our reservation in another restaurant.  After a quick browsing in Yelp, we decided to give Big Wong a try.  Because it was pretty late for dinner, the restaurant was pretty quiet.  There were maybe 2-3 tables.  We ordered several dishes to try, including salt and pepper shrimp, hah-nan chicken, curry dish, wonton soup, and probably something else that I forgot.  Everything was really delicious.    Mind you, it's not a fine dining kinda establishment.  So there is no 'excellent service', 'artistic plating', white table cloth to speak of.  But you get a great, down to earth, delicious meal for a fraction of what you would otherwise need to pay for, it's pretty kick butt.  I'd definitely go back again the next time I go to Vegas.",

The Chicken rice is alright, their porridge was good, big portion and tasted legit.  The high light must be their beef ramen.  The soup is not as bold but since they put different type of spices in it, thats why it is not as bold taste as others but it is definitely good.  The ramen was a bit letdown since i wish they can use thicker noodle but for the price, I am not complaining  Their shrimp wonton is good!!  All shrimp wonton in a bowl for $4.95. Crazy.  I wish we have similiar quality wonton in LA but the last good one shut down years ago.  I think if they can let me beef soup with wonton will be the best match but I don't think they will let me do that.  I will try next time when I go and will give an update.",

I'm on a low carb and low sugar diet so it was hard to find something on the menu that didn't have any rice or noodle. It took me a while to decide. I ended up with the steam mushroom with sausage and veggies. The chicken with mushroom came on its own bowl and the rice with veggies/sausage/rice on another plate. This was good so that I didn't have to pick the veggies or sausages from the rice. We were a total of three guest and the bill came out to only 18.76. Soooo cheap. So cheap that it makes you wonder what type of quality are they using????",

    "text": "I always try to find something good about a place, even after a bad experience. My \"love / hate\" relationship with Chinatown continues as I explore all of its places to dine and enjoy all things spicy and unbland. The love part is the incredible food and drink, which is often so very affordable, and hate is the sometimes incredibly horrible service from the wait staff. I often chalk the latter up to \"cultural differences\", which I often have to remind myself isn't personal, and push through, because more often than not, the food is simply worth it!. But last night was different...  Our usual spot was dark for some reason, and the backup location was jam packed, so a quick check on Yelp revealed Big Wong Restaurant. The reviews were solid, and the food appeared somewhat authentic and non-standard, as some menus tend to be. Big Wong shares a parking lot with a few culinary heavy hitters, and despite the lot being full and crowds waiting outside of a few other restaurants, we entered the restaurant and found several open tables and no wait.  Let me fast forward to the food. The prices at Big Wong are very low, and despite this, the food is good. We ordered deep fried shrimp wontons, pork chop and chicken, and enjoyed the food. The menu is not your standard Chinese food, so don't bother looking for sweet & sour pork or chow mein.   From the moment we stepped foot inside the restaurant, the service was terrible. The woman who was behind the cash register was not only the hostess, she was also the waitress and food server. And she was completely overwhelmed, to point of being overtly rude to the customers, especially me and the family! Like I said, I try not to take it personally, but after being sat down with such haste, there wasn't even a drink order taken. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes while she scurried around and struggled to figure out how to triage the food service. Keep in mind, the restaurant was not full and half the tables were well underway with eating dinner. Just as we stood to walk out (there was minimal eye contact the whole time, as though if she didn't look at the problem, maybe it would just go away!) she came over and took the food and drink order.   Once the order was placed, the food and drinks actually arrived fairly quickly. But there was no follow up during dinner, and I, along with all the other customers had to walk over and grab condiments and napkins from the counter. The best part was when a family of about six walked in. The waitress escorted the family to the table and then turned so quickly to get away from them, she actually crashed into the dad who was still directly behind her, causing quite a ruckus! Another couple entered the restaurant, were seated, and after being ignored for 10 minutes, finally got up and walked out.  Not sure if I'll try this place again with so much to choose from in China Town. If you decide to go, hopefully you'll have better service.",

    "text": "Great Chinese food!  It's like I went over to my uncles house and he cooked for me.  That is how amazing the food is here at Big wongs.  The street Beef noodles are great.  The beefy broth with the melt in your mouth meat is delicious.  Just the right hint of beef flavor, star anis and other great ingredients.  The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.  The rice was not too greasy and it had the right hint of ginger and chicken.  Fabulous!  Dip it in their 2 dipping sauces, and you have perfection on a plate.  The garlic braised chinese broccoli on sizzling plate was great also.  Cooked to perfection where it was crunchy and notes of garlic with each bite.  The chinese pancake (both savory and sweet) were both delicious.  Just the right amount of crunch without being too burnt.  Get this, the amazing part with all the food we ordered, it was under $20!!!  Great food at amazing prices.  How can you beat that?",

    "text": "Fast and super cheap. Big Wong looks pretty questionable but actually turned out surprisingly good.  The menu is short and sweet with maybe a total of 30 items (15 items per side). The prices are ridiculously cheap- everything is around $5-6. The portions aren't very big though, so I would suggest 1-1.5 dishes per person.   Everything we ordered happened to only be $4.95/entree ($20 total) and was enough for 3 people: - Shrimp wonton soup with mustard greens- pretty standard, broth on the lighter side - Dark Meat Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice- this is pretty much Hainan chicken, which is cold/room temp chicken served with a delicious chicken broth-flavored rice and dipping sauces of soy sauce and oil and mild chili garlic paste, great portion of chicken, would say they could add more rice though - Fried salt and pepper chicken wings- comes with some fried pieces of jalapeno, maybe 10-12 wings per plate, pretty flavorful and not too much batter - Authentic curry chicken with 3 roti pancakes- perhaps my favorite dish. This one is Malaysian curry so it's darker and more liquid than Japanese curry. The curry has dark meat chicken and potatoes. The roti that it comes with is delicious and perfect for dipping in the curry.",

We got the spicy shrimp wonton noodle soups and the curry fish balls. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were big. I was sad I didn't find out about this place until the last day when we about to leave Vegas. The place was pretty clean and the service was good. I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "I made a special trip to Chinatown to visit Big Wong based on all the great reviews. It's a solid, cheap neighborhood spot. We tried the things that everybody mentioned: beef ramen and shrimp wontons, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Actually, the beef ramen isn't really 'ramen' per se, but it is a beef soup with noodles. Actually, that's all it is because there literally are no other ingredients. Same situation with the wontons - yeah they're fine, but I can get a fine fried wonton lots of places. And I can actually get a good one some places, too! The main thing Big Wong's has going for it is the price - everything's pretty cheap. For 2 dishes and 3 drinks, our bill was like $10. Also, the service was very fast and friendly. I asked if they had milk for the kids, and even though they don't serve it, the waitress was nice enough to get a couple glasses for us for $1 each. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, but there are a ton of better Chinese fast food places that aren't all the way across town.",

All dishes are pretty cheap but u get what u paid for: I ordered a hainan chicken dark meat and it appeared that the waiter didn't catch my word and gave me the white meat. From the appearance u could easily tell that it's not going to be delicious. And indeed it was tasteless at all!  Service was ok. But because the food was terrible I couldn't wait for the waiter to come to me but went to the counter and paid my bill. Don't visit this restaurant guys if you want the real Chinese foods. U can find better restaurant in the Chinatown!",

Big Wong fell short of my expectations but I don't think it's bad at all, just not as great as everyone else thinks it is.  The chicken wings and shrimp wontons came out hot & fresh but not super crunchy, almost like the grease wasn't hot enough.  I felt that my shrimp wonton it could have just a little more veggies, maybe a few spriklings of green onions even would have been good.  the wontons itself was really good, fresh shrimp with a hint of sesame oil but so boring. My husband's beef ramen was not good.  There's strong beef flavor but tastes to me more from boullion than slow cooked beef broth.  And once again, plain, beef & noodles and no garnishes... It's not bad but not the best either.  And sadly they did not have the congee that I really wanted to try.  The service was just that 1 man and it was pleasant, no complaint there.   Not sure if I'll be back since I've had much better.",

Do NOT come here for ambiance or white glove service. The place is not pretty and service is spotty BUT you aren't paying for it either.  Parking can be a headache as the center has a bunch of other popular restaurants and also a popular bubble tea shop. The staff works efficiently and service may seem spotty.  They do everything from being the host, waiter, cashier, bus boy, prep cook, etc. Now that expectations have been set..... Do Come here for quick, good, hot, tasty comfort food....bowls of noodle soup or rice plates.  A good place for friends and family to hang and have a meal.  Take out seems to be a big part of the business so it must be decent.  The food is not gourmet but does taste good and is filling.  For the same price as a fast food burger place....choose this place instead everytjme.",

Usually, when I go to an asian restaurant for the first time I am mostly confused and the waitress usually can't help you.  I was super hungry and  I asked if these were full size dishes because the prices were so cheap.  She explained everything.  She sold me on a house special.  The dish had rice, a side of something like spinach, Chinese sausage and a bowl of chicken and shitake mushrooms.  This was a house special for $5.95 and it was a hearty meal.  The chicken was silky tender in a nice broth.  The broth was a little fatty which some people may not like, but I like it.   It was real simple and homemade tasting.  If you consider value and the quality of the food this place is amazing.  I would go back fo sho.",

I kept trying to convince the others to instead go to the Ramen place next door but they were stuck on this place. After eating here they wished they would have listened to me.  We were seated pretty fast, the waitress was kind of rude but no biggie. The prices looked good. We ordered and got our food pretty fast. We all got an order of shrimp wontons, first bite was full of grease and the shrimp was rubbery. I tried the beef ramen, it was no better than the kind you buy at the store for less than a dollar. My friend got a shrimp ramen and everyone who tried it said it tasted like dog food. The chicken wings were OK, not great but OK compared to everything else we ordered. Nobody ate more than a couple bites of what they ordered.   We joked that if we ever wanted to dine and dash this would be the place as we could not justify paying for the garbage we were presented with. Nonetheless, we made our way to the counter to pay and as we walked passed the other tables there were full plates of food left on almost every table. Guess we weren't the only ones who felt the same.   We were convinced we were all going to get food poisoning, surprisingly we didn't.",

When I entered the restaurant I was greeted by a nice lady hostess who is also your waitress! She was pretty nice, the first time I went I ordered to go, it took about 8 minutes which was pretty fast, I ordered peppered chicken wings and deep fried pork with white rice. I ate my food at home and everything was still hot and tasty!  The peppered wings had little bits of jalapeno on them, they were crispy and juicy and a perfect amount of spicy! The deep fried pork was alright good texture thoroughly cooked, and the rice was the same, like I said previously the amount of food was really great for the price! It also came with some sort of garlic sauce? I haven't asked what that is but it has a really strong taste, makes the pork even juicier.   The next couples times I went to eat here since there was only one waiter, the nice lady, so even though staff was friendly, I went thirsty for most of my meal.  Overall I love this place, the food has yet to disappoint me.",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about Big Wong and so I wanted to try it out after attending a conference in the area earlier in the day.  My craving lately is for salt and pepper anything.  So I ordered salt and pepper chicken wings and bok choy.    The server was very friendly.  From where I sat I could see directly into the kitchen and that entertained me watching the chef prepare the dishes.  Everything seemed to be clean, orderly and efficiently handled by both the server and the chef.  My food came out and was very satisfying.  The chicken wings had a generous amount of jalapenos and that made me happy.  The bok choy was generously seasoned with garlic.  It was good but glad I didn't have to kiss anybody that day!  I liked that the bok choy was very young and so it made it easy to eat.  As I was sipping on my tea looking around I began to notice a few things.  There are a number of brightly colored posters on the walls.  A suggestion to the management if I may:  I don't see your patrons going around and reading the posters.  The posters don't send a positive marketing message overall.  I think it would look better to take them down and either don't replace with anything or maybe a few pictures on a theme.  I also noticed that while the kitchen and the table I was eating on seemed very clean, the backs of the chairs were not clean and the floors and baseboards need a good scrubbing.  I hope management will think about my suggestions.  I was very satisfied with my meal and I look forward to going back to such a friendly restaurant.",

The wontons were nothing special. Not to mention the person who brought me the soup had part of his thumb in my soup. He was wearing latex gloves however I saw him picking up the dirty dish bucket prior to picking up my soup. The place doesn't seem very clean, the people who work there are not very friendly either. I definitely won't ever go back to this place.",

We tried the ribeye and it was delicious as well.  We also ordered the friend shrimp wontons and Ong Choy greens.  Thumbs up on everything.  Big Wong is our must stop each time we visit the City of Lights.  There is also a bubble tea and a snow ice establishment in the same strip mall.  How convenient is that?",

The curry and chicken wings are pretty standard, but the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars was because of the pork chop dish. I felt bad for my friend who ordered it because it looks super greasy and not crispy at all. This is a pretty standard Taiwanese dish, so I'm not sure why they didn't get it right. Also, I wish their \"roti\" which is like a Taiwanese pancake had green onions in it.  On the flip side, the beef in the ramen was the stewed kind and was pretty tender if you're looking for a soup dish. Overall, the food here is dirt cheap with most dishes around $6, which is what probably keeps people coming back.",

First of all the food was okay, it was little saltier than expected. The biggest pet peeve was the service. Being Chinese I know I shouldn't expect the service to be good because that's how most Chinese restaurants are. But this one, they don't give a damn about their customers. I asked if the could get a specific sauce and some lady server gave me attitude. I know you're stressed and all, but you have stay calm in these situations. Also, their tea was literally just water...  NEVER AGAIN",

Water refill sucked though which is why they're getting 4 stars instead of 5. I was so thirsty quite often but didn't get enough refills.   I ordered the curry with rice, curry with pancakes, salt and pepper chicken, shrimp won tons, and the boneless chicken!!  Curry with rice: average. Nothing special. Def didn't give enough curry sauce because the bowl was quite small and lots of chicken was in there. 5/10. Wouldn't order again bc I'd rather try other items.   Curry with pancakes: same as above. 5/10. Pancakes were smokin hot though haha  Salt and pepper chicken: 9/10 grab this. Order it. Suck on the bones and the skin until you crave more. Spicy as heck but delicious as heck too. Put this shit in ur mouth. Bite it. Swallow it. So good man. Enough said.   Shrimp won tons: 6.5/10 nothing special. I am from Orange County so we have Westminster which makes better stuff than this so its prob good for Vegas but eh for where I'm from.   Boneless chicken: 8/10 wow the two sauces are awesome. Chicken was tender and juicy. Order this for sure guys  Also I thought this place was family style but it looks like each item is for a person except for the chicken wings. Everything is cheap, like $4.99 for everything so I couldn't resist not ordering many times.   Worth the drive from the Vegas strip in my opinion. Yummy. Snowflake shaved ice is in the same area so that's a plus too.   Will be back.",

The food is ridiculously good and the prices are too good to be True (but they are!).     I stepped away from the norm of ordering the chicken hoi nam and tried the special shrimp soup with shrimp and wontons after reading Nelson Q's review.   It was spot on.  Seriously, a really good bowl of soup.  It's a broth unlike anything I could compare it with.   The wontons were made with all shrimp filling and the shrimp on top of that makes this a super value at under $8.   I also ordered some veggies this time.  They did not have any ong choy so I ordered the gai lan cooked in garlic.   The sizzling plate it comes with was nice to see and the aroma of the garlic was in the air.  Loved it.  Gai lan is a bit bitter with the leaves and next time I hope they have the ong choy.  The service was very fast for a friday night.  You order and your dish comes up in about 5 minutes!  Wow.    All the food is good here so far and the prices keep me coming back!",

It was a little bland for me for an egg noodle dish but once I added my own fish sauce, it was perfect. The wontons were what made the dish worth it though. I also replaced the egg noodles with ramen noodles which was perfect texture mmmm  Beef Curry--It tasted more like a beef stew with curry hints to it. Keep in mind, I love curry but I don't like beef stew so I didn't really like this dish. It was a bit salty for me.   Hainan Chicken-- You can't go wrong with it but I've definitely had better. The rice wasn't flavored as much as I would have liked it and the chicken was decent. I like the sauce that comes with it.   All which were okay but because of the price, I don't mind.

Without it, I would have given them 2 stars.    My in-law enjoyed his wonton mein.   Price was very good.  A message to the owners, please use the authentic way of making Hai Nam Chicken.  That starts within boiling the chicken in a pot of ginger, rice wine, etc.  Then cooling it quickly in a bath of ice and water.   Hai Nam Chicken should be served cool, not refrigerated cold, and definitely not warm.",

When I arrived, I ended up ordering chicken rice, chicken wings, and Chinese broccoli.  I ordered all of this with the plan of taking half of it home as leftovers.  The rice itself was very tasty, but the chicken was on the dry side.  You can pick between dark and white meat chicken - but can't do half and half.  The dipping sauces are tasty, especially the sesame oil sauce.  The chicken was not the best, but for $5, you can't lose.  The fried chicken wings were absolutely delicious - 8 for $5.  The Chinese broccoli was very good - sauteed in garlic and oyster sauce.  The food here wasn't the best ever, but it was really cheap!  The service was a little weird.  All of the food came out at different times and the employees are pretty cold and unwelcoming.  But, this is pretty typical of Asian restaurants, right??",

    "text": "Potentially the cheapest and most delicious Chinese fare I've had. Service was dismal, but isn't that always the case at the some of the best Asian joints? Food was incredibly cheap and good. We tried the choy sum with oyster sauce, fried fish filet, special seafood noodle soup, salt and pepper wings, salt and pepper shrimp, and of course the Hoi Nam chicken. There was nothing we didn't like! My favorites had to be the Hoi Nam chicken and the choy sum. The seafood noodle soup had real crab and tasted a lot like lobster, fried fish filet was soft yet crispy, and the salt and pepper dishes were done very well. I love how they leave most of the head of the shrimp on - it has so much flavor. The rice that accompanied the Hoi Nam chicken was very fragrant and you could taste the chicken broth and ginger. I honestly don't know why rice isn't cooked with chicken broth more often. With the Hoi Nam, definitely get the boneless dark meat option with the seasoned rice! I'll be moving to Vegas soon for school and I can't wait to come back to Big Wong to try other things on their menu",

Service was slow since the owner was also the cashier, the cook, and the server, and dinner time was crowded. I would recommend dining at a non-busy hour.  Pretty much everything I sampled was delicious!  Decor was small, cramped, and very uninviting, one of those hole-in-the-wall places. We used plastic spoons and forks!",

    "text": "I was a regular here. Almost every week my friends and I would make our way throughout the chinatown, as us Asians tend to do. It always a question of where to eat every time. We'd drive up and down spring mountain from Jones all the way down to Wynn and almost every time we'd give up on finding a place we were all craving and ended up at Big Wong. It was like our safe bet. Back then in the beginning I would give it a 5 star. Great food. Great price. Great service. A table always ready. A  clean bathroom. That's 5 stars. They still have all this but their food is kind of lacking as of late. It's still good but it's definitely not like it used to be. Maybe it's the change of cooks. Who knows. I still come by every few months when I can during my trip. If I don't though it's no big deal anymore. I do have to say that my usual is Special Shrimp Udon Soup. I love their appetizers. When I used to eat pork their pork chops were always a go to as well as their salt and pepper anything. The fried shrimp wontons are good but sometimes they taste weird. Like something they use to wash their shrimp. I've pretty much tried 75% of their menu and there was 1 maybe 2 items I didn't like. Not that they were bad, just not great. Also if you get a chance try their sweet roti. Essentially it's a parantha with condensed milk poured on it. Basic but really hits the spot.",

The Hainanese chicken sauce is good but the chicken tastes like it was only boiled in water.   The curry chicken wasn't bad, but it could really use more kick. The fried pork chop and fried chicken were really flavorful.   All in all, for 5 bucks an entree you can't complain. If I were in school, I'd prob be here all the time. It's really decent fast Chinese food. Nothing spectacular but cheap food.  ------------------------------EDIT---------------------------------------------------------  I came back and had the Shrimp Soup with Shirmp Wonton.  The soup was really flavorful, the noodles had great texture, and I am definitely a fan of their shrimp wontons.  I was a little harsh on my first review but I should cut some slack since I went during their Grand Opening special.  Value-wise, everything is under 5 bucks with tax so it's a hell of a value.  I'll be back espeically for their fried chicken and fried pork chop.",

    "text": "I had been itching to try this place because of all the raving reviews on the great prices Bing Wong has to offer.   My friend and I came here Monday during our lunch break from CSN. Perfect prices for starving college students. To our surprise the interior of the place was really nice and clean. My friend was expecting something iffy inside since the windows were all black on the outside. Right when we walk in, a man sitting at a table points to tables that are apparently hit with the air conditioned well. Then our waitress asks for our drinks, when she came back she immediately asked if we were ready to order. Since we were both first timers we asked for more time to look over the menu. She left as soon as we answered and then she literally walked to the cash register and came right back to ask us if we were ready to order for the second time. This was kind of irritating especially since the gap she gave us was practically 30 seconds. None the less we ordered. I ordered the rib eye over pasta, while my friend ordered the curry beef. The orders came pretty fast, which was good since we were both hungry. However the food wasn't as pleasing as we had hoped.   steak over pasta- no special char on the steak, which makes me think it was cooked on a regular skillet (similar to how my parents would cook it in the kitchen) and then the pasta was angel hairwith some sauce on the side. We both expected some type of asian noodles rather than angel hair, oh well . The sauce did give the dish a little flavor but overall it was still kinda bland. This dish was okay, I don't think I would order it again.   curry beef- the color of the beef was brown while were expecting a mustard color.  None the less there was still faint taste of curry. It wasn't as strong as we like. Yet again another dish I don't think I would order again.   Although the prices are extremely cheap, I don't know if I recommend anyone else to come here. But I always do like to give places with great reviews a second chance and I probably will since it's so cheap. I mean what do I have to lose, right?",

No.  But was hoping this was that rare place that served good food at super low prices.  Basically, a place where they realizes their prices are too low but are too afraid to alienate their new customers.  Verdict?  Kind of.  Had the pork chop over rice and beef ramen. 1) Pork chop over rice - I'm told you have to ask for it crispy to get it...crispy.  Not sure why they do that.  I did not know this when ordering so was disappointed at the lack of...crispiness.  It was also underseasoned.  Definitely added a lot of salt to this bad boy.  Otherwise it was pretty good.  The egg that came with it had a nice, soft yolk in the middle.  My mom just learned how to cook the eggs that way and we both agree it's awesome.  Ask for this dish crispy and you won't be disappointed. 2) Beef ramen - Again....underseasoned.  But have to say this is some of the best beef I've had here in Las Vegas.  Nice and soft with a lot of flavor.  Just wish they added more salt or soy sauce to the soup base.  The noodles themselves aren't great - basically the ramen you'd get in most instant ramen.  Nothing like the ramen at Monta.  But the overall dish is pretty awesome.  Definitely a step below Monta but at half the price.  I could eat that beef with any dish and be happy.  Overall....a good option and happy they opened.  I can't say that about most of the Asian restaurants in town.  Most of what we have is a dime a dozen.  Big Wong stands out for quality for the price.",

Next time I'd order the curry with rice not because the roti was bad just because I missed the rice. Though, we came for dinner. I think this would be a great lunch spot.",

Salt and pepper chicken wings were good, and so was the chicken curry with the roti.  The Hainanese Chicken rice was just OK.  The chicken was over cooked.  I must say it's cheap but the food had better be good too in order for the people to keep flocking here.",

Then you try Chinatown food looking for a familiar setting you can find comfort in while being away from home, but all you find are high priced food ($8-14/dish) that the tastes good enough. Until you find Big Wong!  This authentic restaurant screams, \"feed my soul with your warm food.\"  You will find specials postered on their walls, a small joint that seems like only locals know about, to appreciate the scent of satay pan as you bite into your garlic infused ong choy, and enjoy the classic no b.s. attitude of the waitress ( which reminds me of ok service, but great food).  No glitz, no glam kind of place. Just sit back, chill, and dine until it hit the spot! On average their price ~$4-6/item, can of pop $1, rice bowl $1. Can't beat that. They keep the menu short and serve quick. Waitress says, \"we have a lil bit of everything, but we don't have everything.\" Meaning= Pan-Asian menu, no fried rice! Don't ask, you'll get yelled at. Hahaha... Everything was great! We ordered: salt n pepper chicken wings, wonton shrimp w udon noodle soup, satay garlic ong choy, good soy sauce.   Cons: wooden chop sticks, plastic spoon",

I've had a few things there that were quite good and a few things that were mediocre, but the food is so cheap that I could pick and choose on the menu and be satisfied. I'd have to say that I did like the special curry beef. Dark, Indian like curry sauce. The menu indicates that it is spicy, but I was disappointed with its heat level. The salt and pepper chicken wings and the shrimp wontons were excellent, but I think this  place definitely needs to improve their dipping sauces. I think they handed me some Sysco generic sweet and sour sauce with my wontons, and it ruined them. Like I said, it's decent, but I wasn't \"wowed\" or anything.",

    "text": "First off I wish you could give half stars.This was a solid 3and a half stars for me. Went last night with the hubby around 10:30 pm (they close at 11pm) there were two tables of customers one of which the owner was sitting at. She got up quickly and welcomed us in. We ordered several dishes to share. Beef ramen, shrimp wonton soup(no noodles), salt and pepper chicken wings and fried shrimp wontons.The order of fried wontons came out in less than 5 minutes! they were all shrimp and delicious but just a tad bit greasy. Beef ramen and wonton soup came next. Hubby started to eat the ramen and I could tell after two bites he was so not into it. My wonton soup was great..filled with tender all shrimp wontons nice greens and a very soothing broth. I said lets switch. He gladly gave me the big bowl of ramen( have to say the portion for 4.95 is quite large) The noodles were okay(not overcooked which for me would be a huge sin for ramen) the beef was tender but fatty and the broth..eww just not for us. Then came the chicken wings just in time to save the day! OMG! So delicious! Perfectly crispy skin and amazingly juicy with just the right amount of spice. Would go again just for the wings! The chef and owner came by to ask how everything was and noticed right away the still full bowl of ramen and asked what was wrong. We told them the noodles were good and beef was okay ..the broth just not to our taste. They explained to us they use plain broth in their ramen (not seasoned and no msg). We said no problem three out of four is not bad . We were soon finished and got the check. I was a little surprised they didn't take the ramen off the bill but I didn't feel that bad cause it was only 4.95. But having been a small business owner myself..I would have instantly taken it off the bill. Nonetheless I think they might get a second visit from me. Three out of four dishes being good and the prices being so affordable..I am eager to try more dishes especially the whole dungeness crab.",

There was a new person that was working as the waiter/ host it was not busy but the lady that seemed to clearly be giving the direction did not have full control of the establishment. She seemed overwhelmed. It took until 7:15 to get our order in. We asked the gentleman if we could order and he stated that he couldn't put in orders only the other lady could. Also the other people that were seated after us got their orders in before we did and it is ridiculous. It is extremely bad customer service and I have never been to a place more unorganized than this. She was overwhelmed and orders were missing. There is no communication and sync between the front of house and back of house. I am very dissatisfied with this place and its service. All in all the experience was horrible as we hear the main lady yell out orders to the kitchen and the cooks yell back in haste and confusion.",

The first thing that will catch your attention will be the price, with each dish averaging around $5(tax is already incorporated in the price) you are probably asking yourself...is this a Kid's meal? Will the food be good? What the heck, all I've got to lose is 5 bucks...so why am I hesitant to give it a try? & tried we did (Monta was packed & the wait was long & i was hungry!) The Star of our dinner was definitely the fried chicken, definitely worth the 18 minute wait! The beef ramen was ok, the fried pork chop was ok, would've been better if it was golden brown & not pale, I loved the plain udon soup, salt & pepper shrimp ok, Mango pudding ok...roti with chicken curry ok...in short, this place is AVERAGE, not super great but not bad at all as well. It is a retry decent meal considering the price. I would probably come back here, but as far as craving it, not really. This would be PERFECT though to have blind dates because what if \"You are just not that into her/him?\" at least you did not spend that much! (be sure to bring your own set of utensils though and your own glass!) they only have plastic spoons & forks etc.  and styropore cups???? Tsk, Tsk, Tsk... hey beggars can't be choosers!",

The person serving us was very busy, but ensured we were taken care of. I could see in the kitchen that they were busy cooking for the people seated and also the take out crowd.   I always liked places like this, when you order a coke and it comes in a can, or like I did ordered a Thai iced tea, and the ingredients are mixed right in front of you.

I think I liked the chicken curry better than the beef because it had potatoes.   It was $16 for the whole crab, and was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again. It was a steamed crab served over flat rice noodles with a soy ginger dipping sauce on the side. The crab itself was kind of small and the head was emptied, which is a shame since the best part is mixing rice into whatever juice is in the crabs head.   Chicken wings were as delicious as they look -  crunchy, slight heat from the jalapenos. I'm thinking it has a lot of msg, which is fine w me. It was prepared basically how salt and pepper pork chops are in Chinese restaurants.   I was a little disappointed in the noodle soup. The brisket was great just like in the curry - fork tender and full of flavor. Noodles were good, but the broth was pretty bland. I just tried some of my friends, but its probably good if you add siracha hot sauce and soy sauce.   They've added the specials written on the wall to their menu, which is a huge help. Another positive is that they have fun soft drinks! We had Welch's grape soda and Sunkist orange soda! Can't go wrong with that.",

I was too hungry to wait, so we decided to give the Beef Ramen at Big Wong a twirl.   We were greeted super warmly and given two big cups of steaming, delicious tea. We didn't want to go all in on the ramen, so we ordered one ramen ($5.99) and one garlic stir-fried choy sum ($4 and change).   Just to be clear: this is not beef ramen. It is really more of a beef noodle soup prepared with thin ramen-like noodles. As beef noodle soups go, it is decent for a quick, cheap fix. The flavor is pretty rich, and the beef is definitely tender and tasty. Overall, the soup is very simple: broth, beef and noodles.   The vegetables were delicious, just like I like with heaps of garlic and not too much oil. Granted, there are only 2-3 green vegetables to select from, but any green is delicious when prepared with this much garlic. When the chef brought it out, he told us next time we should order the vegetable \"Thai style\" because he is Thai. I didn't get the specifics, but given his warm smile and clear passion for preparing the dish, I definitely want to go back and try.  I would consider returning just for a lunch of well-prepared vegetables! I took my glass of tea with me, and as we were leaving, they were eager to top off my glass with hot tea. Such attentive, happy service makes you feel great about supporting a business. Thanks, Big Wong!",

    "text": "I am SO glad that we made the \"fortunate mistake\" of coming to Big Wong Restaurant! We came here because yelp listed this place under dim sum. This is NOT a dim sum restaurant where they serve the small tasting dishes like Asian tapas, but I'm SO glad I stayed.  First, I'm NOT a fried won ton fan, because I can make them better than most Chinese restaurants. (True) BUT THIS PLACE makes won tons like they are SUPPOSED to be made! These are NOT the usual fried thick, greasy won ton wrappers full of over-seasoned fillers of minced indistinguishable shrimp mixed with egg white and minced bamboo shoots. Instead, THIN, delicate crisp wrappers, and the flavor of FRESH REAL plump chunks of shrimp are allowed to shine through in each bite. When you use fresh, quality shrimp, the flavor of the fresh shrimp is what shines through!  I had the steamed chicken accompanied by gai lan (Chinese broccoli), lap cheong (slices of Chinese sausage) and steamed rice. The vegetables were perfectly crisp tender, the sausage was of good quality (meaning not fatty & salty), and fluffy steamed rice. The dish was a great balance of flavors with the delicately flavorful broth from the steamed chicken.  The prices are cheap, and portions generous, but that does NOT mean this place skimps on quality! If you want Chinese food made with FRESH ingredients and not full of bloating MSG, come here! Even the tea is great: a slightly sweet jasmine tea!  And you MUST MUST MUST finish your meal with the SWEET ROTI! (See my tip for more on the SWEET ROTI!)",

At first, I was hesitant to dine there because I thought it was going to be the same as most other Chinese restaurants. It took me several times passing by until I finally gave it a try and now, I dine there almost every week! (no joke!)  This place is AMAZING!  Granted, upon walking in, the establishment is not as nicely decorated as most other restaurants. BUT DON'T LET THE LACK OF INTERIOR DESIGN FOOL YOU!  The food here is delicious and the cheapest in town (NO TAX ! )   I always order their fried shrimp wonton ($4.95 .. 10-12 pieces) The wontons are served with sweet chili sauce. What makes them so good is the whole shrimp that is stuffed inside. They are also super, super crispy and delicious as appetizers.  I also suggest getting their beef ramen, or wonton soup. ($5.95) .. The broth they make is very sweet and flavorful. It isn't bland like other places. The portions they give you is also very considerate.  I also love their sizzling garlic sauteed vegetables. (only $6.95) They serve it on an iron plate that they bring out to you smoking and sizzling. Every time someone orders it, the whole restaurant smells like garlic! It is so delicious and perfect to eat with rice! You can also order it with thai chili which adds an amazing spice. The blend of garlic and chili is absolutely perfect.  The last thing I would definitely recommend is their Authentic Hai Nam Chicken. The rice that is served is cooked in chicken broth so you get the full flavor of chicken in every bite. The chicken itself (cut in pieces, either dark or white meat) is steamed in ginger and garlic. I love this plate! The aroma of the marinated chicken is so flavorful in your mouth. You get two different types of dipping sauce with the dish. A semi sweet soy sauce and an amazing semi sweet chili dipping sauce. Both of these sauces are great with the chicken!.. The portions are also very filling!  As for desserts, I would recommend their sweet Rotti ($1) .. It is pretty much a crispy fried tortilla with condense milk and powdered sugar. I was super surprised how delicious these 3 combinations taste together!I It is very simple but very tasty! ---  The only con I would give to BW is that they don't have a very extensive drink/ dessert menu. Just be prepared for can sodas and about only 3 selections of desserts. However, the entree selections are plentiful.   Overall, if you haven't tried BW yet, you are missing out! My girlfriends and I always overindulge ourselves when eating there and every time, our bill is under $25 (we always go with 3 or more ppl!)",

    "text": "Today was the last day of the grand opening special so I dragged a few of my coworkers to join me.  We arrived about 3:30pm, the place was packed but the wait wasn't very long, only 10 mins for a party of 5.  Seems like they turn the tables over pretty quickly for a little place.  They only have 14 items on the menu so we had already decided what we were going to order before we sat down.  I got the Hoi Nam Chicken over seasoned rice, my friends got deep fried pork chop over rice, fried pork chop with udon noodle soup and curry chicken over rice.  My Hoi Nam chicken was moist, the dipping sauce was delish but the seasoned rice was the best!  We all tried each others dishes- the curry chicken had great flavor, it was more Japanese style (which I like) but was a tad greasy.  The fried pork chops were also good, but better when you dip in this sauce they give that has a beef stock taste to it.  We also ordered some vegetables in oyster sauce that was okay, nothing special since it was just steamed/boiled Chinese broccoli with sauce.  Overall, it was a success cause our meal came out to $7.95 for 5 entrees and 4 drinks with the special.  I would defiantly come back since the regular prices are still not bad at all- $4.95 including tax.",

But if you add the fried chicken in it, it gets better. I don't know if thats normal or not but overall it was pretty good. The staff doesnt really say anything or gives a greeting, or checks up on you while you're eating. You just do your own thing but I think thats expected since it is Chinatown. I'd come back though to try an entree w/ rice. :)",

Staffing appeared to be a husband and wife with one other person in the kitchen.  My wife chose the shrimp wonton soup which was salty and pretty much devoid of flavor though the wontons were good.  I ordered the steamed chicken with mushrooms, Chinese sausage and choy som which was just okay.  We also shared a mango pudding that also was just okay.  Service was good and prices low, but I do not consider our meal a bargain because the food quality and ambiance were below average.",

    "text": "Yesterday, me and my girl were in search of a cheap place for lunch in China town. Fueled by good yelp reviews and low prices, we found ourselves at Big Wong.  While the reviews rang True:  the place is 'cheap,' the portions ample, and the service friendly, I found myself disappointed with the lack of color and flavor in each dish.  None of our dishes came with ANY type of veggies, and common sauces found in Asian food (General Tsao's, Sweet n Sour, Orange, etc.)were completely absent from the selection.  We started with the Salt n' Pepper wings, which were the only item I tried that were actually quite tasty.  The downside is they only serve the smaller wing piece, no drums.  Then, we ordered a smorgasbord so that we could sample a bit of this and that.   Beef Ramen:  The beef was tasty, but had just as many pieces of fat as actual meat.  The noodles were a great consistency and the broth had hints of cinnamon.   We realized almost too late that they did give us some green onions on the side to amp up the flavor.   Chicken Curry:  Sandra said it was delicious.  It looked too unappealing for me to try, plus I could tell it was made with stringy dark meat. Fried Chicken with 'Seasoned' Rice:  This was one of the many times our server told me 'NO'.  No, they don't have a fried rice option, No, there are no veggies in the dish.  No, I can't add a few pieces of broccoli to it.  Instead, if I wanted any vegetables, I would have to pay an additional $5.95 for an entire veggie stir fry lunch.  I paid the additional charge for the white meat chicken, which actually had a nice light crunchy coating but had absolutely no seasoning on it.  I found myself wishing I could have this flavored like the Salt n' Pepper wings.  The 'seasoned' rice seemed to have been cooked in a simple broth.  Again, no actual seasoning, no hints of veggies, nada.  This was also served with a questionable looking 'partially boiled egg' that neither of us was willing to try. The Veggie Stir fry:  Because I actually LOVE veggies WAY more than most people, I sprang for the extra full-price charge to have the veggie plate, which was a simple dish of some cross between broccoli rabe and spinach.  There were just as many huge chunks of stalk as leaves.  I cut up some of the leaves and some of the jalapenos that garnished the aforementioned wings, added that to my chicken and rice dish--now I had some flavor.   Did I love Big Wong?  No.  Did I hate it?  No.  Did I take the leftovers home and doctor them up with some peppers, onion, mushroom, sesame oil, soy sauce, pepper, garlic, and cayenne?  You better believe it----that shizzle was delicious.   Bottom line:  If you don't mind your lunch plate consisting of several different shades of beige and/or are eating on a budget, you should find this spot ideal.  Keep your expectations low on the atmosphere and accommodations (we even ate with plastic utensils and drank from Styrofoam cups which were never refilled).  We limped away with a $30 tab for 2 with 1 app, 1 soup, and 2 entrees.  It would have been a bit less, of course, if there were some damned veggies included in the food.",

Fried Shrimp Wontons - yummy! just like a shrimp ball in a different form Mango Pudding - it has mango chunks! Almond Pudding - it has litchi and longan bits in it. Sweet Roti Pancake - this is AMAZING! Roti with condensed milk and powdered sugar on top!

Really 2.5 stars because the food is so cheap.  My coworkers always talked about this \"good Chinese food\" place near my work, so I figured why not try it out on Thanksgiving since it's one of the only places I could find that was open.  To my amazement, most everything on the menu was $4.95. Score for awesome prices, but of course you get what you pay for.   Ordered the steak with rice, salt + pepper chicken and the shrimp wonton soup. The steak was soft, like it was boiled ,and it didn't have that lightly charred crust. Salt + pepper chicken was ok - nothing to rave about.  The wonton soup was pretty bland and so were the egg noodles I ordered with it.   This food is AVERAGE/sub-par at best.  Not sure why people think this is a hidden gem? My mom certainly cooks better food than this. I can cook better food than this.   Would I go out of my way to eat here? NO. I would only come here if coworkers wanted a cheap place to eat during lunch hour...and even then I'd reconsider and suggest going to Monta Ramen next door. HA.",

We went with the pepper chicken wings, a bowl of shrimp wontons with noodles, and chicken curry with roti- and all were on point. The freshly deep fried chicken wings came out piping hot - almost too hot to even hold. There was a very thin batter and just the right amount of salt and pepper, exactly how I like it. The shrimp wonton and noodle soup was perfect for the chilly, rainy morning. The wonton were packed with fresh shrimp and the wrapper was thin and delicate - exactly how I like my wontons. The chicken in the curry was so tender - meat easily falling off the bones as the fork went in. The accompanying roti was nicely pan fried with a thin delicate browning - perfect for dipping in the flavorful curry. Could not have hoped for a more perfect breakfast. The server (owner?) was also super prompt, responsive - not a ton of chit chat, the food is the name of the game here. I was also impressed that the place was cleaner than expected. They even had a premium version of disposable chop sticks and napkins - quite impressive for a Chinese joint!",

    "text": "So my time in Vegas I wanted good Chinese food and I found my self looking up yelp reviews and found this place. This place had 800+ reviews so it was decided, where we were going to eat. I went there right when it opened. So me and my girlfriend were the only ones at the restaurant along with another couple a few tables away from us. We order the Chicken wings, beef noodle wonton soup and curry with Roti. Since it looked pretty good on yelp. Tue pictures made me wanna order it and of course the reviews of the wings. The wings was good!! The beef noodle soup was warm when it came to the table. I didn't really like it. Every time I order any kind of soup. The soup is usually hot. Which gave the food a better taste. The curry Roti was okay. The worst part was the service. When I asked for more water she ignored me. So I thought she didn't hear me. She walks into the kitchen and has her back facing toward us the entire time after we order our food. The service got very very poor once the food hit the table. If you would want better Chinese place, I would say go somewhere else. This place shouldn't be 4 stars.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to amend my previous review a bit because of one menu item.  I was talking to a friend about how I didn't enjoy Big Wong at all, and he told me that he really likes one particular dish on their menu. Fast forward to this weekend when he suggested that we hang out. I asked if he wanted to \"show me how good Big Wong can be,\" and he obliged.  This game-changing dish was the ~$5 Hainan boneless dark meat chicken with seasoned rice (#2 on the menu). We actually split an extra order of seasoned rice, leaving us plenty to go around. The chicken and rice were both quite tasty and sufficiently seasoned, and I liked both the soy and the spicy sauces that accompanied the dish. I would certainly recommend this place as a cheap lunch (and an excuse to hit up Snowflake Shavery for dessert).  We didn't get appetizers, but I'll stand by the curry chicken with roti and the salt and pepper chicken wings from my first visit. Just avoid the shrimp wonton soup and beef ramen like the plague.",

I came in a group and we had the Hoi Nam Chicken which came with a plate of the chicken flavored rice, 2 sauces and cucumbers and then a whole different plate of just boneless chicken pieces.  If I wasn't sharing, this alone was totally enough food for 2 meals for me.  We also got the pork with  preserved egg (1000 year old egg) congee which with a little soy sauce and white pepper was super homey, comfort food.   We also ordered the pork ribs and salt & pepper fish which were both well made.  We'll make sure to be back again on our next Vegas trip.",

Prices are great with everything under $10 and the orders come out fast.  Appears popular with the Chinese speaking crowd.   Beef Ramen - several reviews mention this so we had to order.  In reality, it's just Chinese beef noodle soup but using ramen noodles.  Perhaps an attempt by the owners to capitalize on the ramen craze. Overall, broth was clear and tasty but not as flavorful as most top ramen places in California or NYC.   Beef pieces were very tender and the tendons were melt in your mouth.   Hainan Chicken - tender boneless dark chicken meat.  Had to ask for the minced garlic.  Overall found the dish a bit muted in flavor but better with the sauces.   Baby bok choy - stir fried in wok.  Standard fare.    Salt and pepper chicken wings - delicious.  Nice slices of pepper.  Perfectly deep fried. Good stuff.   Overall we had a good meal.  Big Wong isn't in the league of any joint in SF, LA, Vancouver or NYC but for Vegas, it's a nice find.  Their soy sauce chicken looks fantastic...maybe next time.   Big Wong accepts credit cards but not Amex.",

    "text": "Cheap and delicious food for the poor college student.   My boyfriend and I come here every so often and order the same appetizer, entree and dessert every single time.   Appetizer: 10 piece fried shrimp wontons. These are quite addicting. Just like how you open up a box of Pringles or start munching on some microwavable popcorn and you cant stop? Yeah, that addicting. Each simple wonton has a huge piece of shrimp and are perfectly fried, accompanied by sweet and sour sauce.     Entree: Just when we're about to order more shrimp wontons, our Thin Rib-eye over Pasta is sent to our table. For $4.95, this dish is absolute heaven, both for our bellies and our wallet. They don't skimp out on the meat and comes with a side of steamed potatoes. We like to pour the brown sauce (some type of beef broth thing) all over the plate to tie the rib-eye, pasta and potatoes together.    Dessert: Sweet roti drizzled in condensed milk is the way to go! My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so I end up eating most of this myself. The almond pudding is also divine. So refreshing - it's the perfect end note to the meal. You can't go wrong with these two items for a grand total of $2.25.   This place is located in a small strip mall with minimal decor and menu items handwritten on neon poster boards all over their walls. Don't judge a book by its cover, though. The food is seriously amazing for what you pay for.   Oh yeah, if you end up ordering to-go or box up your leftovers, their to-go boxes are top notch and reusable. Fancy plastic to use again and again!",

    "text": "You must try this restaurant if you are visiting Vegas. If you want to fill your stomach with good food, then you are at the right place. If you want relaxing, excellent customer services, then you are at the wrong place, the strip is the place you should go.  I came here due to the Yelp's reviews for dinner, it is not a very big restaurant, the table seating setup is good for group of 4 to 6 persons, if you have more than 6 in your group, then you are expecting a longer wait, or separating into 2 tables.  Now for the food, we ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the fried shrimp wonton. The Hainan Chicken Rice is the best I tasted so far in West Coast. Their Hainan Chicken Rice is very similar to Thai style chicken rice, I would say about 95% similar. The chicken meat has very good tender, not too soft or too hard, and I believe the rice is steam cooked with the chicken soup, because by just eating the rice itself, it is already very tasty. For the fried shrimp wonton, it is very crispy and the shrimp is fresh too. I would recommended these two choices.  For services, I would agree they are out-staff, so you have to be patient with them. Especially the lady waitress, she has to do everything from taking order, serving, cleaning/setup table, take phone order and cashier. So be patient.  We even came back the next day for our lunch. For the food, I would come back again. Oh! I forgot to mention one more thing, the price! it is unbelievable cheap!",

We ordered three dishes and while we were eating. I notice the lady doesn't wash her hands after she touches the menu, take orders, answer the phone, serve food, and clean tables. With her unclean hands, she makes Wontons. I felt so uncomfortable and disgusted. I will never come back to this place. I hope the owner read this review and instruct the workers to mandatory wash their hands before making Food!",

The owner was so cheap that when the waiter left ample napkins for us, he actually took some back and while taking our order and then went back to the waiter to apparently tell him that he left too much napkins. Also when the owner/chef came to take our order he appeared impatient cause I guess he was short staffed or too damn cheap to hire enough wait staff even though they weren't very busy. Food was cheap I will give them that but nothing is worth horrible service. I'm one and done with this place.",

It almost felt like I wanted more seasoning, but then I change my mind because of how gentle the crisp is. It came with tons of jalapenos so I was happy to get my fix for spiciness.  The price is insanely low, especially for the quality and portions of food. I overheard other diners raving about the food.  If they delivered, my life would be made. I will definitely be back soon.",

There are certain items that are tasty: thin rib eye over rice (best item hands down), hai nam chicken, soy sauce chicken, salt and pepper wings/pork, vegetables with oyster sauce, and any of the desserts (mango or almond pudding, or sweet roti).  To avoid: the beef ramen. People rave about this in reviews, but I think it's pretty bland. Probably better to go with something else.",

I can come here and we can get a meal with drinks and get out for under $20 with leftovers and stuffed!  I have tried a few things but love the Hainan Chicken (boiled chicken) with dipping sauce (sauce is a spicy chili and sriracha and a more mellow soy based sauce) and rice.  The rice they must add a broth or something to it because seriously I could just eat the rice it is that good!  The boiled chicken is healthy I just skip the skin.  We like to get the On Choy (a water spinach) with fermented bean curd (you can get it without the bean curd as well) very flavorful and good!  I have also had the wonton soup the pork udon soup and a few other things, however I keep coming back for the chicken.  My boyfriend says it is a comfort food for him and reminds him of growing up.  I don't think I could buy all the ingredients needed to make this for that cheap!    The place is clean the staff is nice I believe it is family owned so they don't have a full staff so sometimes the service is slow but I don't mind that because I know it is a small business.  It is always clean and orderly.   I always leave happy and full with money left in my pockets so I am a happy girl...",

The Thai tea is cheap but comes in a small styrofoam cup and filled half with ice. Also, if your group orders the Thai tea, some will have a good amount of milk and some will not. I chose the house seafood special with rice noodles. The soup was not spicy at all and the soup base made me feel sick. Everything is cheap, but that's all the quality food you get.",

They were good.  I really enjoyed the beef ramen.  We also got Thai iced tea which were in small 8oz styrofoam cups.  Everything about this place screams ASIAN!!!

I know... this is Vegas and who the heck would want breakfast 10 in the morning?  Their Beef Ramen is essentially just the typical Chinese beef brisket noodle soup. If you are looking for Japanese ramen you will be very disappointed. You can even 'substitute' the ramen with the normal rice noodle. It wasn't bad. The brisket could be more tender.  The specialty Hai Nan Chicken Rice was reasonably tasty. For those of you not familiar, the rice accompanying this dish is just as, if not more, important than the chicken itself. I found the rice here quite nice. It has right amount of subtle flavors and not overly greasy. The sauce for the chicken was mellow. The flavors could really be stronger. As for the chicken I opt for the bone-in dark meat version which I found likable.  Overall a good place for a quick snack.",

We tried the chicken curry with roti cause I read soooo many reviews about it but unfortunately, nothing about it wowed me! :(  We also tried the salt and pepper shrimp and I won't say it was horrible...but I was not impressed. Leaving the head and shell on was quite a deal breaker for me.  The pro is that this place is more than affordable but unfortunately the lady/probably owner isn't that friendly. Another thing I found really weird was that they would use real plates, but give you plastic utensils, which is a strange concept to me. This place is really only 3.5 stars worthy but thinking about the dessert roti makes it 4.  Here are the priceless reactions for the roti and chicken wings <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FISQtcRiSMU&s=f9fb21eb6a4a9ae92179402c9d348e523fa104cc6c1983f0ae102b338c38e7fd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">t.co/ISQtcRiSMU</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2F1xGG31eeTL&s=a78cd1b8154f3b4f4eeaf5a0173dc598a87daf4dda28fac0d520dd56212cf478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">t.co/1xGG31eeTL</a>",

    "text": "We're two of the few Yelpers who are not habitues of Chinatown, mostly because when I eat out I like atmosphere, and when we want Chinese food we usually do take-out from the local place.  But we came here after our Airbnb friend and fellow Yelper, Chan, hosted a Meetup for LV Airbnb hosts and also set up a UYE for Big Wong.  And we were delighted to participate in this trifecta:  meeting new local hosts, meeting Yelper Antonia R., and getting to try a new Asian restaurant to add to our woefully inadequate go-to list.  True to form, Big Wong lacks atmosphere, but makes it up with an interesting menu and very cheap prices.  Sure, some of the dishes are small, but the low cost lets you try a greater variety of their offerings.  I ordered the Shrimp Soup with noodles.  My husband, who was suddenly gripped with some mysterious illness (not food related!!), needed some broth, so he ordered a plain cup of chicken broth and I shared the huge quantity of noodles in my soup.  But after seeing the wonton in someone else's shrimp soup, which looked fabulous, I was sorry I hadn't gone for that one.  Still, my soup was amazing, and a great size for the 4.95 price.  Next time it'll be the wonton version.  We also got a Curry Chicken with Roti pancakes, and I loved that combination; it was a big change from the usual rice. Unfortunately for me, the hubs wasn't so sick that he gobbled it all up before I could get more than one bite of chicken, but that one nibble was moist and tender.  I also got to sample the baby bok choy in garlic that Chan ordered, something that I had never knew existed, and it was astounding.  We probably would have ordered another dish if hubby had been feeling better, but it was a good start to what I know is going to be a regular stop on the Silk Road.",

It was obvios too that the cooks were not happy because I can see how they worked and I am a chef myself. No harmony . No team.   I liked the fact that there was no fried rice, egg rolls, chow mein, sweet and sour or orange chicken. Pretty authentic and prices are $5.50 for an order of eight wings. $7 for 8 little nuggets of black bean pork ribs. The to-go boxes were high quality plastic. However, they were too small. The Chinese box containers would hold more and are more affordable. Soy sauce,salt, sirracha, and pepper are not on the table but are available on request.   So with no front of the house staff, this place gets only 3 stars due to service operating only at 20% of where it should be and that unhappy back of the house means super slow service too. There was only 3 other tables(maybe a four top , two top, and a one top). I do not recommend dining here if you don't have more than a hour to spare and if there are more than 12 people total dining here(including you).",

We responded, and without a word he grabbed our menus and threw them on the table, then left. Later after coming to our table he asked us if we were ready to order. When we didn't respond right away, he looked as if he was going to go to the table next to us. He then took our orders and talked to us in terrible English and a soft voice, so he was barely understandable. He seemed indifferent and impatient, with horrible manners. We suspect that he is the owner.  After the food came, we noticed that the presentation of the dishes wasn't appealing and the temperature of the dishes weren't very hot. The food also wasn't very tasty, and the table setting lacked basic condiments. The shrimp wasn't fresh, and other dishes had a strong overwhelming pepper taste. Water was served in styrofoam cups, which looks cheap. The waiter didn't warn us about the heat, and someone was burned.  All in all, terrible service, okay food and a lack of basic things made for a unpleasant experience that we wouldn't recommend to anyone.",

The utensils are plastic forks and spoons and the water comes in paper cups.  Since we were just visiting and couldn't take leftovers with us, we came here for a light dinner.  We ordered the salt n pepper chicken wings, wonton noodle soup, and steamed chicken with mushrooms.  The chicken wings were tasty.  The wonton meat was a bit soggy.  I liked how they chopped the veggies in very small pieces for the wonton noodle.  The service needs a little improvement since it seems like there is only one person handling the front and phone orders and the dining area. I felt bad each time I had to ask for something.  I saw someone just getting his own refill on the iced water.",

After a weekend of lavish and expensive dinners (kidding), it was quite nice to end the trip on a deliciously homey and cheap meal.  The GF and I came for lunch on a Monday.  There were several other tables eating.  The menu is simple, with only a front and a back.  I appreciate this because it allows the cook to fully master each dish.    We decided to order the shrimp wonton noodle soup, curry chicken, and the chicken wings.  The food came out in a timely manner.  The soup and curry came out first.  The wonton soup was spot on, and was everything I could hope for.  The curry was definitely one of a kind.  This was literally the first time that I have ever eaten curry chicken without being fearful of biting into pieces of bone.  That was so awesome.  The curry was thick, and tasted hearty.  The chicken was moist and slow cooked.  The chicken wings were top notch.  They were crisp, and the seasoning was on point.  The diced jalapenos added a kick that tied all the flavors together.    The best part of the meal was the price tag.  I will definitely be back, and make it my mission to help spread the word that this place exists.  Keep up the good work Mr. Big Wong!",

No other restaurant can beat Big Wong's combination of comfort food, cheap (and great) prices, and no wait for seating.   My favorite dish here are the salt and pepper chicken wings (as many other Yelpers have already mentioned). On both occasions I've been to Big Wong's, the wings come out fresh and hot. They are perfectly crispy and tasty and are only $5.50 for one order.   I also like ordering the noodle soups, which come in various combinations. My favorite is the House Special Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup ($5.50!!!). As a salty- flavored lover, the broth can be a little bland to me, but still good. The wonton is very tasty.   Big Wong's is the place I always suggest when people ask what to eat in Vegas. The prices are incomparable and it's always nice to have some Chinese comfort food.",

    "text": "So if you are expecting traditional Chinese food you will probably be disappointed. The majority of the menu was Taiwanese, Malaysian, and Singaporean. These are a little different from Chinese food especially American Chinese food. I got the fried chicken and noodle soup. At first, I really thought it would be chicken in the noodle soup. But it's actually two dishes. A bowl of egg thin noodles with broth and a dish of fried chicken thinly sliced with a cinnamon breading on the chicken. It was ok but definitely different and not what I expected. My friends ordered a Malaysian curry dish with red sauce broth. Not what he was expecting either it was ok he said. My other friend ordered rib eye with rice. Pretty much what you'd expect, though ribeye is thin. The best thing we all agreed were the wonton shrimp appetizer. For the money and if you are feeling adventurous it's worth trying. But know this will be an adventure, don't come thinking it's something you've had before, I think that's where we went wrong. We should have been more open minded and sought an adventure and not prejudged. Ask questions to see if it's the right direction for you tastes.",

We are now insisting that she has more birthdays each year so we can come back again. And again. And again. We're all fans.  Six people in our group and we all ordered something different. An order of fried shrimp wontons. Ribeye over roce with potatoes.  Curry chicken with noodle soup (that would be my order). Beef ramen. Stir fried vegetables with Chinese broccoli. Shrimp wonton soup. We didn't really share so I can't tell you about the five dishes I did not order. I can tell you that everybody seemed please with their meals and for the most part finished everything.  My curry chicken with noodle soup was absolutely perfect for me. I had been craving curry and this satisfied the craving without fail. There were big chunks of tender chicke and potato. A rich red curry sauce/broth. Different than other more pungent Chinese curries I've had. This was more of a cross between Indian and Thai curry. My two favorites. Beneath the curry chicken goodness was a dense bed of thin rice noodles. I topped it off with copious amounts of green onion and called it soup. And when I was done I slid deeply onto the post-curry zen zone so typical of when I eat a good curry. And life was good. At least until we all got back to the office.  Big Wong does not appear to have lunch specials. But with the prices and portions they are serving up, they don't need lunch specials. Six of us ate a filling and phenominal lunch for a grand total of $42 and change. It is hard to beat that. My boss said it best, \"we've found a new lunch spot.\"",

The wings were tossed in just the right amount of seasoning... and were piping hot. I kid you not, big Wong Is the real deal if you don't know.... now you know.",

    "text": "We came here because of the glowing reviews.  And we needed something quick and delicious.  Not the case.  The six of us (5 adults / 1 toddler) came last Friday for lunch around 11:30am.    There was only 1 cashier/waiter (young guy with tattooed arms and two ladies cooking in the kitchen).  I noticed a health inspector back there writing documentation.  Not sure if he was the reason, or if the staff were the 'back up' crew.  But the food SUCKED.  Our family ordered Hainan chicken, beef tendon noodle soup, beef noodle soup, and wonton noodle soup.  The Hainan chicken was dry, tough and tasted old, like it was made the day before and reheated when we got there.  Only 2 sauces were given to us, a sweet soy sauce and a hot sauce.  There was no ginger and scallion sauce.  Very disappointing especially since I had a really good one at Cluck2Go in Pasadena just a couple days before.  Beef tendon had that \"unwashed\" taste, like dirty feet (you know that taste), just didn't taste fresh or edible.  The noodles must've been sitting in it's broth for a while before being brought out to us, because they pretty much filled up the bowl and left very little soup.  The place was dark and greasy and service was slow.  Yes there was only one guy, but yo dude - you are young and you should be able to move faster than that.  Or show you have more control of the front of the house.  If you have time to lean, you have time to clean (or at least check every table if they needed anything).  Even the most 'under' average places in the SGV would run circles around this place in terms of food, price, and speed.  I was outside walking my toddler when a Filipino lady came up to look at the picture menu.  She didn't want to wait in the long line at Monta ramen (in the same plaza).  She asked me about the food.  I told her my opinion and recommended SK Seafood a couple of blocks away.  She immediately jumped in her van and left.  That was our experience.  Will never come back.",

We saw the people behind us eating the boiled chicken and had to try it. You've got to get the #2 when you're here. So flavorful, including the rice. I know. Boiled chicken for $6? and how could could it possibly be? Well, it's real good. Lots of protein and flavorful sauces and a few slices of cucumber. Yum.  We also split the shrimp dumpling soup with noodles. In hindsight, I could have skipped the noodles, especially since we had carbs from the rice. Broth was very clean and delicious tasting. Chinese broccoli was a very nice touch. Dumplings were tasty.  Barking can be a b*tch, but if you wait around, you'll find something. Lots of good restaurants in this little strip mall.",

If you haven't dine in here, it's worth checking out their extensive menu from a pretty small establishment is absolutely impressive! The prices here are ridiculously cheap with awesome speedy service.   The beef ramen is a must try and it's one of their popular items on the menu. I can never finish the bowl no matter how much I was hungry on that day. They give you lots of chunky proteins and a tasty broth that goes along with it. The shrimp wonton noodle soup is not as flavorful as my other favorite Chinese restaurant. However, it still does the job.   Although the chicken curry had a good amount of tender meat, potatoes, and a mild curry flavor, the curry wasn't smooth enough to me. I can feel some grittiness when eaten slow. And then there's their baby bok choy that I absolutely love! It has lots of garlic with enough bite without overcooking the vegetables.   This place is a must try at least once. I try not to order the same dishes when I dine in because there's too many options to choose from. I should really go out of my comfort zone.",

    "text": "When I visit Las Vegas, I like to escape the hustle and bustle of the Strip once in awhile. I find it soothing to step away from the fancy buffets and flashy celebrity chef restaurants. What I desire is a simple, authentic Asian meal. The photos of the Hainanese chicken served at Big Wong's tempted me. The parking was horrendous because it is next to a popular Korean and ramen restaurant. Pro tip: I did not spot any \"no parking\" signs at the Jack-in-the Box and Auto Zone next door. After parking blocks away, I was worried as I stepped into a nearly empty restaurant. Usually the places I go to in Vegas have a wait time out of popularity. I ordered the first item on their menu, \"Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken over special seasoned rice\". As expected, the chicken was very bland and poached with very little seasoning. It's the dipping sauces that do the trick. The two sauces that came with the meal are a soy-based sauce and a mild chili sauce. The famous ginger sauce that usually accompanies Hainanese chicken is served only when requested. I'll be sure I get that next time! When I took my first bite of the rice, I was immediately taken back to my youth. I was suddenly sitting in my childhood home. I awaited my mother to brind the chicken, steam it, and serve it lovingly alongside rice for the entire family. I would devour it voraciously; nothing could beat my mother's cooking. The chicken drippings always added a wonderful savoriness and depth to the rice. As I ate my meal at Big Wong's, it felt like the chef's unknowing tribute to my late mother. I wanted to hug the cook but held myself back due to the awkwardness that would clearly follow. Thank you Big Wong's for an exceptional meal that I never knew I could experience again.",

Beef stock was flavorful and semi reminded me of a pho but much stronger! Huge large pieces of tendon. Made very well and tender.   4. Wonton noodles - simple basic and gets the job done. My dads a vegetarian and can eat 2 big bowl of noodles so the noodles were for him. The wontons are very basic not a huge piece of shrimp or anything. I do think it has more skin than meat but it was not bad. I probably wouldn't order this dish again and try the other ones!   5. My dad got noodles and veggies. It's basic too for your average vegetarian! Lol   I'd be coming back the next time I visit Vegas!",

    "text": "Overall: Big Wong serves pretty damn good Hainan Chicken for an astonishingly low price (at least to this Californian). If only there were one in Orange County...  Food: 5  Hainan Chicken with Seasoned Rice: I don't think that they use Vietnamese free-range chickens (Ga Di Bo), but they do an excellent job of cooking it as if it were. The meat is moist and it retains the firmness of free-range chicken. The meat portion is HUGE. The rice is also perfectly cooked. The grains are separated but not dry, and it taste like chicken and ginger.  Salt and Pepper Wings: Although it's a little fatty for my taste, this is a good option for those who like wings. It's crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. It's a good appetizer, or it can be eaten as a meal if you order a bowl of rice.  Service: 3  I don't expect much from Asian servers, so the service was alright to me. The waitress was a little brusque, but she got our order right and brought us anything that we asked for. That's good enough for me.  Ambiance: 4  It's located in a small plaza with several restaurants and a boba shop. You can already see how parking might be a pain, but we didn't have a problem on a Saturday afternoon. Inside, the restaurant is surprisingly clean for a Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "The bountiful glowing reviews for this place greatly confuse me. I came with my family on Friday night; it was pretty early, so there were only three other parties in the restaurant. The setup of the place is very clean and simple; nothing to complain about.  On to the menu, the dishes here are obscenely cheap! Especially considering that this is a mom and pop shop, I wonder how they manage to make any money. We ordered four \"Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice,\" large ribeye with a side of bok choy, and choy sum with oyster sauce. Portions were generous, which I also appreciated. And....that's about all of the accolades I can give this place.  I have not had hainan chicken anywhere else in Vegas; HOWEVER, I have had this dish plenty of times at multiple different places in Southern California--and it is a dish frequently made at home. An AUTHENTIC version of this dish uses free range chicken where the chicken does not feel very tough when boiled. That was not the case here. I get that it's probably what's keeping the price so low, but c'monnnn, can you not advertise it as authentic then? Additionally, the rice was overly mushy--too much chicken stock/water was used to cook it. The rice was not very fragrant; they could've benefited from throwing in garlic and ginger into the mix. Sauces were okay--nothing to write home about. The ribeye was a great deal for $12. It was pretty fatty, but hey, it's $12 bucks, so I won't complain too much. Choy sum was literally just blanched and then had oyster sauce poured over it; it would've been better if they had sauteed the veggies with the oyster sauce. Pouring it directly over just makes the dish super salty. I know I'm being super nit picky, given that this is a super cheap place. Food was passable. If judging on food alone, I would come back every so often.  So why the 2 stars? My biggest gripe with this place is the service. I've been to plenty of Chinese restaurants and know that service is not priority. What annoyed me the most was that we never got a friendly smile out of our waiter--and I definitely saw him smile at other patrons. My aunt tried ordering in Chinese (because hellooooo, Chinese restaurant with part of menu written in Chinese)--and the waiter rudely interrupts, \"English only. I'm not Chinese.\" Okay. I have nothing against not being able to speak a language, but there's definitely a more tactful way of conveying that to your patrons. Then, as we were ordering our dishes, he stops us mid-order and tells us we are ordering too much food and that three chicken dishes + extra rice is sufficient for our party of four. O.K. So if I overorder, can I not bring it home? Isn't it beneficial for the business for patrons to order more food? More orders = more money? If I was concerned about portions, then I would ask you about the portion sizes, no? But okay.   TL;DR Super cheap food. Passable food. But you better have super thick skin x239028390 for the awful service/free advice on how much you should be eating.",

The prices here are super affordable and the food was good quality. We didn't order any vegetable dish but the dishes we did ordered came with plenty of vegetables which was nice. All the dishes came out good. The steam fish was so soft and tender. I liked the sauce and ginger that came with the fish. Wonton soup was good, it had a lot of vegetables with it as well. The curry beef was good but just to warn you the sauce was spicy! They have pictures of their food on the wall to help you order which was really nice because it helped us order. :-). Overall it's a good spot to go here for affordable Chinese cuisine. I would just have to add that they can work on their friendly customer service because they didn't really check up on us and they seem to occupy themselves doing other things while customers were there.",

    "text": "Like a dubbed old school low budget kung fu movie, Big Wong keeps it simple with good menu selections and low prices.  Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it.   First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.  I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.    The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.  The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned!   Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills.   So if you want good food at low prices with decent service, you can't go wrong at Big Wongs! (Pun intended)",

Unique roti experience.  1 star is because we specifically asked for dishes without MSG for my partner because he is super sensitive. He had the Hai nam chicken with plain rice. Asked specifically if the dish and sauces that came with it had MSG. He woke up at 3am with an MSG stomach ache. DO NOT eat here if you have an MSG allergy. The waiter/owner admitted to using msg in my dishes when I asked, but denied it's use in my partner's dish. But he still got a stomach ache. Should have just ordered a fried egg for my partner since it is the only thing he can eat in restaurants that use MSG.",

    "text": "5 Stars for the Price!!! But as for my Pork rib with bean sauce and wonton soup is only OK to me. Service is slow since there's only 2 people working hand in hand and that just means I have to time to look around  and observe this place. Well, I found that the server was doing everything in the front from giving utensils, order, bills, and cleaning it up. But, hmmm one time he was picking his nose and then grab the plastic cups and then serve it to the guest. It would have been ok if he grabbed the bottom part from a stacked plastic cups but huwaaa it was on the mouth part. And I just bowed my head coz this is the part I am really expecting it to happen. I know sanitary wise this place won't meet my standard.   I think they should hire another employee who will deliver the order to the table/wash the dishes so that the host would only touch base the billing, setting up the table. Bad part of it if there's only 2 employee, the host goes to the kitchen and grabbed the food while there's a line for guest paying their bills and that's how he is touching money again and then grabbed another order which he just touched the bill and onto the plate. It's okay if he can do everything like this as long he would sanitize his hands every now and then. But overall, I am so glad there's a place like this where the price was really inexpensive and affordable.",

I asked if customers usually come up to the front desk to pay, he didn't understand my question and didn't reply to me.  We didn't get to-go boxes either...had to ask for them.

While we were eating, there was a bum guy that came in. He asked to use the restroom and she said the restrooms were only for customers. He said he was going to order something but needed to use the facilities first, and could he have a copy of the menu to take to the bathroom with him. I was like o.O. This lady did not skip a beat and even though complied, when he came out and tried to leave, she asked him if he was going to order anything (of course he never was going to) and basically embarrassed him in front of everyone.

However, Vegas doesn't serve very tasty Hainan chicken but Big Wong definitely will satisfy your craving if you cannot make it to Savoy Kitchen instantly!   I always order the Hainan chicken rice and seasonal stir-fry vegetables. I also really love the salt and pepper chicken wings, chicken curry with roti, and the sweet roti with condensed milk. There are quite a few things I don't particularly like from here, such as the beef noodles thatt tasted very bland when I tried it. However, the good things weigh out the bad and you cannot beat the price of their dishes!   I don't suggest coming here if you are someone who is looking for a spot with excellent customer service, as many authentic Asian places don't carry that to begin with. Give this place a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy the food and won't leave with a hole in your wallet!",

Thai style Ong Choy, Roti, all of it was amazing.

Also, being from NYCnand having frequented Big Wong in Chinatown there, I really was hoping to find a restaurant here to call home. I was pretty disappointed. The prices are definitely easy on the wallet but the food was just bleh. The service was also crummy. When I was waiting for my food, the cashier (owner?) was in a heated argument in the kitchen  with the chef, who seemed like a relative. I believe the care that goes into cooking is affected by one's mood so I was  not too thrilled to hear the heated exchange. I may return to give it a second chance though not sure when that'd be.",

The waitress recommended the Salt and Pepper Chicken for an appetizer so we agreed. The food came out super fast. My husband enjoyed the Curry Chicken and had some leftover to take home. My soup was good. I enjoyed the seafood-y broth. I found some shrimp poop in a few of my shrimp so that was a little turn off. I just scraped it out and continued eating. The Salt and Pepper Chicken was also good but not the best I've had.  I gave this place 3 stars because the food was solid and good portioned. The waitress was a little short. When I asked if they had dungeness crab, she simply said no and walked away while I still had another question. I'm used to that type of service in Chinatown so that didn't bother me much.   This place is good for cheap eats and satisfying your hunger but I don't think I'll be craving it much.",

    "text": "After spending a lot during our vacation, we just wanted something simple and fast. We saw the reviews for this restaurant and since I usually trust Yelp reviewers, we decided to visit. There was 1 server and 1 cook and only 1 other party of 8 in the restaurant. We should have left at this point. After 10 mins, our server brought us water in styrofoam cups. One of the cups had a pin hole leak and slowly wet part of the table. We asked the server for a new cup and some napkins to wipe the leak. He told us to move to the next table back. Again, we should have left. But we stayed. Dad got #1 - it was dry. Mom got the steak pasta - it was ok. (Very fatty, low quality meat). Brother got curry chicken - also very dry. I got beef ramen - flavor was good but again low quality meat. After bringing the food, our server never returned to our table. We had to get up and ask for water refills. The food was inexpensive and definitely not worth the wait or the lack of hospitality. I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "Ok, so...I gave it a second try before writing this review.  I would say that for the beef ramen...I love the noodles that they use it is really good.  Not much broth flavor but you can doctor it up with the condiments if they had the right kind...may be they will get some like what pho restaurants offers.  The beef is tasty and they will ask if you want tendons or not...cool...  Hainan chicken w rice...it was decent, sauce could be better.  Of course I am judging this with my experience from eating this famous dish in Thailand.  I will come here for this dish bc again I will not make it at home due to too much work, and I like that you can ask for white meat w/o extra charge.  I had Ong choy vegetables this was decent too.  Then we ended with sweet roti, it was ok.    2nd visit...  Good wonton soup, I would get this again.  Fish ball curry, well I guess I don't like Malaysian style curry I won't get any curry dishes since Malay is the base for their curry. Chicken wings, umm...really salty and not any other flavor...  I want to like this place.  The restuarant is really, really clean.  I think the lady owner has OCD in a good way, she spays and clean table right after customers leave...a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  They are really nice and courteous and the cook is constantly asking me what he can do to make this place better.  I told him the price is right so far, they will have more business if they can improve the flavor of the food.  Nevertheless, if you are hungry and want something fast to eat and not Mcdonald's...it's an alternative:)",

A trendy food truck might charge a buck a piece but here at Big Wongs you get a plate full for 5 bucks.  I'm writing the update because of how friendly the owner is.  We had my girlfriend's son with us and he made sure to get the kid some chicken he would like and recommended us to try some very good things.  The shrimp wonton udon and beef curry were awesome.  We left, bellies full for around 20 bucks.  See ya soon Big Wong's!",

    "text": "For what it is and what they serve this place rocks. Thanks Yelpers for steering us this direction. We came about 3pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy at all. Only 5 patrons at the time so our food came out quick.   From the outside, Big Wong's looks kinda iffy coz it's in a semi-ghetto looking strip mall and the windows are all blacked out. Plus the signage outside makes you think twice but on the inside it's super clean, cute and newer! Yay! Looked more like a cafe setting than your typical Chinese food place. You can tell they're still messing with their menu coz they have hella neon signs on the wall advertising what's NOT on the plastic menu. They really should just quit playing and invest on new menus. We got:  -Steamed fished 2 large fillets: $9.95 - Very good and super fresh/fluffy like a steamed fish should be like -Fried Salt Pepper Shrimp: $7.95 - Excellent dish, lots of good sized shrimp for the price and so nicely crispy without being oily. They even cleaned out the head and snipped the \"whisker\" of the shrimp so you could eat it all!  -Won Ton Noodle Soup - $4.95 - Enough to feed two people with other dishes but was bit underwhelmed by this one. It was good but wasn't exciting.  -Garlic stir fried Gai Lan- $4.95 - This had to be my favorite dish, it was unbelievably flavorful and came on a sizzling platter.   Pros: -CHEAP! Super freshly made food at cheap prices. Cheaper and better than a Panda Express that's for sure. -Everything was tasty and fresh, good portioned, not too big, not too small but just right. -Quick service (coz nobody was there) -Inside is light, bright and clean  Cons: -No curb appeal but eh, who cares, the inside is nice",

We ordered the curry chicken with roti, beef ramen and sweet roti for dessert. They have a much more extensive menu than before and they also have daily specials that look delightful. All the food is still incredibly cheap for the portions and quality, which you just can't argue with. I enjoyed this visit quite a bit more than our first visit and I'm already craving some more of their cheap eats.   There aren't many places that you can have a sit down meal, including dessert and a drink for under $14 and still leave satisfied. Sometimes good prices makes food just taste that much better.",

SERVICE: We came at 4pm on a Monday so it was dead inside. There was only one other party of 2 and 3 empty tables left with dirty dishes on them. After receiving our order, which came out pretty quickly, we waited to ask for water. However, no one came out for a while, so we had to go up to the register and wave into the kitchen for service. Actually had to get up and wave them down a few times throughout our meal. Not cool. ALSO can they please get some real utensils?? The plastic stuff bends when you pick up food. No bueno  -__-   FOOD: -Chicken and Rice: I got this because of the good yelp reviews. Compared to a lot of other places that serve this, Big Wong does it all wrong! It comes with no condiments, unless you specifically ask them for each one. Chicken was dry and didn't seem very flavorful and the rice wasn't hot.  -Wonton Soup: The portion size is good, not too huge, but enough to fill you up. The soup was bland though, we added soy sauce, pepper, ginger sauce, chili oil...basically whatever was on the table just to give it some flavor.   PASS. Don't waste your stomach space.",

When the Asian guy with a big white hat came to take our order, he looked really irritated every time I asked him a question. I understand if you do not speak Chinese, but was it really necessary to reply back with rude tone?   Anyways, we ordered the Hai Nan Chicken rice plate - avoid ordering this because it is not authentic at all. The chicken and rice was not Hai Nan style at all. There was no flavor what so ever. We also had the salt and pepper chicken wings - they were OK. The shrimp wonton noodle soup - the noodles were probably not cooked because they were still stuck together. The \"shrimp wonton\" was basically shrimp wrapped in wonton wrapper.   After trying to flag a waiter to get the check, we just decided that it would be a lot faster to pay at the counter. It would have been better to look for other restaurants in the chinatown plaza.",

Salt and pepper fish (catfish) came out very well and pretty bland but. I tried salt and pepper once before, many years ago and they came out very salty and peppery but this place is all about measurement-control, they don't give you too much of any ingredients, so suck it up and eat! We had wonton soup as our starter, this one did a superb job! Try it! The place is clean too, note the chefs prepare food with gloves on. I went to the bathroom to check the cleanliness and confirmed it's well-maintained. The kitchen is viewable from a distance. Service, they can do better, maybe with more smiles. Not too smiley here until hubby breaks the ice with the host then he started to smile and talk with hubby. He told us that he used to live in Astoria, Queens. Small world! OK I recommend this place if you want to try salt and pepper style fish or chicken, food is pretty bland but \"attractive\".",

We ordered 7 dishes total cost less than $40, so worth it!  -Garlic chicken wings -Salt & Pepper pork chop -Roti & Curry chicken -2 Wonton soup -Heinan chicken & rice -Salt & Pepper chicken over rice All of them taste delicious. We stuffed ourselves before heading back to home. We'll miss you. +++for super clean bathroom",

Their curry sauce has a deep complexity of flavor that only a real chef can make -- this isn't just curry store bought curry powder thrown into coconut milk.  The chicken was super tender and juicy.  The SALT AND PEPPER FISH WAS THE JAM.  Also, the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  Do yourself a favor while in Vegas, forego the $200 one night and get this instead.  You'll be glad you did.",

Perfect, especially in this chilly weather!  No other bowl of noodles compare, IMHO.....Taiwan Deli? Nope. Pho Kim Long? Not even close. Monta? try again. Ichiza? No way. Haven't  tried Bejing Noodle Cafe yet, but Big Wong has my vote...  Even more awesome is that Wai was nice enough to go ahead and SUPER SIZE our bowls, doubling up on everything!!!! Salt and Pepper Shrimp was perfection as well. Connie told us about the new Dessert Roti, and right away, we got two orders because neither of  us was gonna share our dessert!  Soft, warm, and the perfect amount of sweetness with condensed milk drizzled on top with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar. a nice sweet ending to a meal. Even sweeter is that they are just a dollar each!  Thanks again Connie and  Wai for such great food, and even greater hospitality.....ALOHA!!!",

It's affordable, delicious and clutch.  I've been here a few times, but I'll share a little ditty about my first visit. I was in the mood for some soup, and was in the area. I had walked by once after a meal at Raku, so I figured I'd actually make the visit this time. Probably the funny name  I ordered the Shrimp Wonton soup. Steamed wontons in a very delicious broth. I was recovering from a cold, so this was very necessary.   Everything was simply perfect, down to the addition of baby bok choy in the soup.   The staff was very friendly, and because I was so enthusiastic about my meal, I ordered a second order to go. Each order is about five bucks.  If you want to splurge, order the dessert roti. It's a mindblowing hand stretched roti sprinkled with powedered sugar and drizzled with honey.  So, whatcha waiting for? Hit this place up.",

Ordered the following items: - curry chicken w/ 3 roti pancakes (curry was flavorful, but it's small dish with about 3 pieces of chicken & 2 potatoes) - house special shrimp wonton with ramen soup (came with 5 shrimp wontons; loved the broth - just the right taste to my liking, wasn't too salty; did not skimp on the ramen) - special deep fried chicken over rice (chicken was fried just right.. really juicy and really liked how it was boneless.. however we weren't not crazy about the sauce it came with. We just dipped our chicken in the curry from the prior dish.)  Our meal with an order of 2 sodas came to just over $16.00! What a deal! Our server (who may be one of the owners) was pretty friendly as well. Not an extensive selection of items on the menu, but we are still looking forward to our next visit & trying different items.   So if you're looking for cheap eats, this is the place!",

I am assuming one of the guy back there is Mr Wong himself. Everyone there work very hard. I guess he could use more hiring help but then again he prob can't keep his price down low and /or making any profit The restaurant's a plus for it low price, noodle soup is bland but the shrimp wonton is good according to hubby. Kids like fried shrimp wonton so we ended up order two portion of that. Wonton was very crunchy,shrimp was moist5/5  Fried  pork chop  was ok 3/5-pork chop wasn't crunchy and bland but the sauce they gave help it taste better HaiNam chicken 3/5 again it was bland but the portion chicken is adequate  Fried chicken wings were juicy but slightly salty4/5 Sweet  pancake roti 5/5 you would think it belongs in  a Mex restaurant   rather than Asian since it looks like fried flour tortilla smothered with condensed milk mixed with honey and dusted with powered sugar. Our fav dish would be sweet roti and fried shrimp wonton. Oh and we love the prices for 4 that come up less than 50$",

    "text": "Beef Ramen is so delicious. We liked it so much that we went back the next day:). Best of yet, it's only $5.95.   Hainan Chicken rice (boneless dark meat) is also very good, though we had better chicken.   We also ordered vegetable with Hoisien sauce. Fresh and no disappointment.   To sum it up, great comfort food at great price.",

    "text": "One of the better Chinese restaurants I have been to in the US, with super cheap prices to boot!  The beef ramen was great; Chinese vegetables (greens) were a bit too overcooked for my personal taste; the salt and pepper shrimp came with full-size shrimp + heads (not your popcorn shrimp variety from Chinese buffets); the fried pork chops udon soup was fantastic (fried pork pieces were juicy and tender, the sauce actually had complex flavors, the udon soup was clear but flavorful. Despite being a \"fried\" dish, everything was light and not at all greasy).   We were disappointed that the curry dishes had been sold out that night, but overall, we were very satisfied and the meal was very kind to our wallets. Great find in Las Vegas!",
