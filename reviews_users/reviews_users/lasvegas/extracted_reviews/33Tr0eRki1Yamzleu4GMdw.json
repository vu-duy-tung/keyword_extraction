    "text": "I first visited Rosallie for a Cheese and Wine Event they were having. It was $26 per person and we got 2 glasses of wine each, a plate with a variety of cheeses on it as well different breads and some grapes. I came with a group of friends and we all enjoyed learning about the different types of cheeses that the owner, Jonathan, had on display and plated for us. Staff here is very friendly and inside is spacious enough to accommodate small and large groups. I arrange brunch often with a group of friends and since I enjoyed the Cheese and Wine Event, I decided to choose Rosallie for our next brunch meet up.   Jose was great about reserving and pushing tables together to accommodate our brunch. For the most part everyone enjoyed their food with the only complaints being from a few who got some of the sandwiches and felt the bread was too hard. Some commented that they have had the sandwiches before from here and it was softer and that the bread appeared to be a different kind than they had on previous visits. All of our orders came out quick except for the last few, which sat behind the counter plated for far too long. I personally went to the counter and asked Jose if those plates were for people in my group and he said \"yes it's coming right out\" so I went back and told the people waiting what he said. Several minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, so I got up again to ask what was going on and noticed the plates of food still just sitting there. At this point I said \"I can deliver these plates if it means they get their order\" and he quickly picked up the plates and brought them to our table. I believe he meant well, but with a new girl working who was having all of us point out what we wanted from the paper menu because she wasn't familiar with the menu items, it seemed to leave him trying to pick up the slack. This is a known popular spot, especially on Sundays, so having the right amount of knowledgeable/dependable staff is important.  Macarons ($12 for a dozen) - I'm not a huge fan of these in general, but I know others love them (shout out to Rohlin A.!) so I figured they would be nice to put on the table for my guests to snack on. They seemed to be well liked by everyone with some people going back to try other flavors.   White Truffle Latte ($5.50 large) - The latte art was super cute, but the flavor was a bit too intense and not even lightly sweet like I'd hoped from the white chocolate. Wouldn't personally order the white truffle latte again. I also had a Hot Chocolate ($4.60 large) and it was delicious and chocolaty!    Petit Dejeuner ($9.99) - Toasted French Bread, Butter, Homemade Jams and your choice of a Croissant or Chocolate Croissant with Orange Juice and any large drink of your choice. Yes, you get 2 drinks with this one. This is a very fair price for what you get, if you get the order correctly. I picked a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, so that was a bummer. Also the menu says you can choose any large drink, so I ordered a hot chocolate since the first one was so good except this time it was a smaller size than the first one. Not a huge deal, but getting the order right and serving what the menu describes should happen. Croissant, bread and jams were very tasty.   Croque Rosallie ($8.30) - Paris Ham, Sweet Onion Bechamel and Mozzarella Cheese on a Croissant. This tasted so good! I shared half with hubby and didn't like doing so because I wanted to eat the whole thing myself it was that good. I'd for sure order this again and recommend others try it.   They have a patio area with tables outside. You can check their Facebook page for updates on future events.",

I had the Tartlin Angelique....It was their special that they had by the register....It looked great and I couldn't resist...  It was DELICIOUS!!! I devoured it. :) the bread was perfect. They toasted it and it had the perfect amount of crunch with a chewy texture to compliment the hardboiled eggs and the fresh green mix on top of the toast. Delicious. I would definitely come back for this. :)  I also got a tea to drink with my meal....I got the earl grey and it came out in a French press....I love a good earl grey and this did not disappoint. It was DELICIOUS.   Seriously everything about this meal was great. I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu.  So glad to have another gem in the SW....yay!!!! :D  And before I forget....the staff....the girl at the counter that took my order and brought out my food....very very friendly!!! :)  Ambiance 4.5/5 Food 5/5 Tea 5/5 Staff 5/5",

As pretty as everything was I was not greeted or offered help until I started asking for help. I think they were busy making drinks, but an acknowledgement would be nice. I bought some coconut macaroons and vanilla meringues to go. They were tasty and well made. I would of bought more goods or even a coffee drink, but was not offered even to do so. One would think it would be a basic question at the counter, but nope. After my total, I handed my credit card and the employee was looking off somewhere so I had an awkward moment where I was left hanging until I said, \" Here's my credit card.\" Maybe it was just an off day, but kinda disappointed in the service.

    "text": "I went here over the Memorial Day weekend and was very happy to see another French cafe pop up on the Westside. We had just eaten at Baguette Cafe the day before (still one of my favorite spots), so I tried to replicate my usual order at Rosallie to compare. I got their Quiche Lorraine, which was not as bacon-y as Baguette Cafe's, but came with a generous portion of salad and featured very fluffy eggs. Not too much actual bacon in the piece we got, so I might opt for a different quiche in the future. My husband devoured his Nord sandwich (smoked salmon, cucumber, sweet onions and capers, but I was able to sneak in a bite or two and loved it as well. The salmon portion and the salad portion again was very  generous with this order. The bread paired so well with all the other ingredients and was at the right temperature to enjoy the sandwich. My husband was still thinking about how delicious it was the next day. We ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup, which I would not get in the future - watery and lacking in cheese, definitely not the hearty and rich bowls of soup I'm used to seeing, but good if you did need something milder in flavor. The Nutella croissant was a big highlight for me and so hard not to devour before the rest of my food actually came. Nutella is drizzled on the outside and there's so much oozing from the inside within the perfectly flaky croissant crust. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I opted for the peach iced tea, which I will pass on in the future. They had a hot chocolate though that I'm curious about for next time.   The restaurant itself was very spacious, the cashier assisting us was very friendly, and the owner checked in on every table that was there. As others have mentioned, signage says \"Le French Cafe\" instead of \"Rosallie\" so it's easy to miss. If you find yourself at Jaburritos, definitely pop into this place and pick up a pastry for dessert!",

I got in line and waited, waited, and waited. Neither one of the associates looked up. You had 1 making sandwiches like it wasn't PRIME breakfast time, and the other making a coffee drink like she had never worked the machine. The women in front of me was never helped and I walked out after waiting in line for a few minutes. Get it together, pouring coffee doesn't take but seconds, and while your spreading mayo on bread you can look up and greet your guests. And put some pep in your step. It's breakfast time, your a cafe, and you aren't busy.  Oh-and there is menu for food anywhere.",

Maybe I haven't tried the \"right\" ones on the two visits I made.",

I ordered the duck confit sandwich with some island berry tea. The sandwich was absolutely delicious with some in store fresh made multi grain bread, and the tea was a perfect compliment to a great lunch in such a quaint little French cafe. While we were eating the chef/owner stopped by our table to talk for a moment about the food and how we liked the place. He had an accent, so I can only assume that the food is authentic. Either way it was delicious and he was extremely friendly. I will definitely go back to try some of the other options on the menu, as well as recommend this cafe to friends.

The food was not pleasant to look at and as everyone knows  you eat with your eyes first! I had the Quiche Lorraine, when it arrived the top was completely burned and in their defense I did not send it back. I scraped the burnt part off the top, the remainder was very good, the crust and eggs adequate. I spoke with two of the employees about the dish being burned and they just \"blew me off\" one actually said that it HAD to be burned so the middle would be done??? Ludicrous! No apology or offering to make it right. They do have great lattes, with very artful designs and very tasty! As we sat and stayed for quite a long time because we were celebrating a birthday, the smell of burning food was very pervasive! That was a constant smell all the time that we were there. I will not and cannot ever recommend this place due to the complete lack of trying to please the customer and the terrible burning smell of food!!",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast w/ my friend Mara. This place is different from our usual everyday breakfast , but I love trying out new places.   Visually , this is the cutest cafe we have here in Vegas. I loved all of the French decorative touches & the very cozy and roomy atmosphere. There's plenty of natural lighting (perfect for photo ops !) and variety of areas for seating - they have wooden & white marbled tables , a lounge area w/ couches and even an outdoor patio. I'd love to come here on a sunny day or on a rainy day. Their music playlist is very nice too.  Soon as you walk in , you are greeted by their friendly staff. You order at the cash register and they bring everything right out to you :) They have beautiful glass displays of pastries (the croissants !!) , desserts , and quality loose leaf teas (so cute they have their tea leaf samples displayed on the counter under small glass domes). They even have homemade jams to buy & a wine cellar. For their menu , they have a decent selection of sandwiches , salads , soups , etc. So there's healthier alternatives as well as options for all your carb/sweet tooth needs.  Everything was presented lovely and the food was excellent ! I got their veggie quiche (8.70$). Quiche was very fluffy and delicious. It perfectly paired with the salad it came with. Keep in mind , their portion size is just enough to satisfy smaller stomachs.  I must comment how much I love their desserts too. I have been here just once so I only tried one of theirs but it really made a good impression on me because it's not overly sweet like American desserts. We shared their chocolate raspberry tart which was the right amount of sweetness and tartness. You must try their creme brulee latte (3.75$ for a regular). Again , not too sweet and it's the perfect blend of caramel and coffee.  It is a little out of the way for me , but well worth the trip. It's right off the 215 Rainbow exit next to Jaburritos. One of the top places for breakfast/brunch , catching up with a few friends or even studying. They provide free wifi & have phone charging stations too. I much prefer this place over Sambalatte.",

My parents are picky on cafes as they are originally from Europe and ever since we have stumbled upon Rosalie no where else compares or comes close in the fad of them all over town. From the charming whimsical decor, amazing owner Jonathan, staff, and all the exquisite divine food this place really is a dangerous addiction on the SW near me and so many friends I have also gotten hooked as well for our weekend lunches lol. You have to grab a croissant sandwich or flatbread with delicious herbal iced tea and ofcourse follow with a perfect cappacino and some decadent desserts. I adore rare local non franchise businesses like this run by people who truly have a passion for what they do and it shows in every detail/quality that franchises dont have. My piece of paradise in Vegas and feeling like I an abroad on vacation after a long work week lol. Always a relaxing, clean, mellow vibe with more than one table or super loud/overcrowded as many similar type Euro Cafes in town. No one manages the balance like Rosalie and couldnt recomend them more. Thrilled they expanded out of state and they deserve all the praise for being so unique! :) A++++",

    "text": "We read about this darling French bistro in one of the Vegas blogs.  It sounded too good to be True!  Parisian croissants and pastry in Vegas?  Not possible!    But unbelievably True!  Rosallie captures the essence of a French cafe in Sin City!   Perfectly textured, flakey crisp croissants on the outside layers and tender sweetness on the inside.  A taste of heaven.  Butter croissant and Pain au Choculat were flying out the door early on in the morning.   We had a lovely breakfast pastry paired with a wonderfully warm ambiance.  If you've never been to Paris, Rosallie will give you a taste of the pastry that you're missing!   Vegas locals are lucky to have this gem in their backyard.   Simple menu that speaks volumes of the French culture.     Magnifique!",

    "text": "About time I reviewed this place since I come here every week after work in the morning. And oh, hey! Duchess of this place after a few rounds of check-ins isn't bad either. Sweeeet.   Arriving at the Rainbow Boulevard and Patrick Lane intersection at a small unsuspecting plaza next to Jabburitos is a quaint french brunch cafe called Rosallie. Upon entering, a look on your right and you'll see an array of shapely wooden and white marble tables. To your left are the baristas, dessert displays, tea leaves, and cursive scribbles from their chalk board wall menu. There you have it: a comfortably simple, Southern French atmosphere. Almost nine times out of ten I am greeted by a friendly barista. After placing an order, towards the back you'll notice a small sitting area with couches, more marble round tables, a charge station, and a large shelf of books for you to immerse yourself in. There is also a small see through wine cabinet called La Cave for the wine lovers out there who want their daily fix.  I always drop by for their 'Nord' in salad form instead of sandwich, sans the sweet red onions. You get a mix of the usual spring veggies, spinach, capers, sliced baby tomatoes, mandoline sliced cucumbers, carrots, topped with smoked salmon. The dressing they have on it can sometimes be salty (and somewhat sweet/citrusy?) so a request for them to keep it on the low is highly recommended if its too strong for your tastebuds.   Oh and let's not forget their creme brulee latte here. I quite like it; the aroma after a having a whiff of the whip always makes me happy because I honestly believe I'm sniffing a confectionary. I take a few sips of it, and the flavor is smooth, creamy, and slightly buttery but satisfying. Call me ridiculous but if they ever add strawberry or blueberry fruits next to it (or even in it), my insides would leap with joy.   Their charcuterie isn't bad, but neither is it overtly delicious. The prosciutto was a bit dry and some cold cut meats were either salty or too chewy. A suggestion would be to add an array of cheese that best compliments the meats. Other than that I wouldn't really bat an eyelash for this and settle for a pastry instead.   I'm a bit taken aback that I have yet to try their soups, teas, and desserts (I have a guilty sweet tooth, oh dear...), but I'll try them eventually! Apart from that, whenever I just can't be bothered to make my own, Rosallie tops for my early morning salad cravings.",

There are areas with couch like chairs to sit and get somr work done and there are tables to eat all around the place as well.   The workers were very nice and even brought our food and coffee out to us. Since we've been here a few times we know that our favorite thing to get is the Nord. This time we decided we'd also try the sud since it has prosciutto and my friend really loves that stuff. We split both sandwiches so we could compare which was better. I also decided to get the americano coffee which was pretty tasty. The Nord was delicious as always and I love how they also provide a salad with the sandwich. The sud was too salty for me so I ended up leaving half of the half sandwich I was given by my friend. Later on we actually also tried the peach green tea and that was really good.   Overall, we enjoy this place and the fact that we can go there to get some work done is great. They do provide free wifi like Starbucks which is great, but isn't so busy as a star bucks which is also a plus for us!",

It's a cute little cafe but the food definitely is their biggest charm. Everything I've tried, from their Almond, Chocolate and butter Croissants to their Madeleine's and Canele's have been outstanding but I'd have to say my favorite here is the Nord Sandwich. Smoked Salmon, red onions, cucumber and capers with homemade spread on a pretzel roll made in house. Oh myyyy! My head is spinning just thinking about all the deliciousness in one bite, perfectly pairs with the side salad it comes with.  Also note worthy are their latte's and specialty drinks. There are a lot of varieties they offer and seems like the list gets longer every time I come in. Drinks that will surely appease the coffee fanatics and comes with fancy latte art to boot! C'mon, tell me a Nutella S'mores latte does not stop you in your tracks?!?! You had me at Nutella! The last sip? WOW.  4 stars because there are more goodies I need to get my paws on like the Quiche Lorraine, macarons and various French pastries because where else would you try it but a legit French owned bakery right? Now if only I can find balance and exercise more lol! There's a lot to be said about this place but you just have to try it for yourselves, what are you waiting for?!?! GO!",

It isn't displayed anywhere and nobody knows about it. Not even half the staff. I would definitely come back again to sample more pastries but I'm on a diet and I'm cutting weight. Until next time.   The photo attached is from the bathroom. I don't know who that is, but I like his jacket.   Au revoir",

Rainbow and Patrick, across from the firehouse subs and tops and bottoms yogurt place.  They have a beautiful tea selection with quality loose leaf tea. None of that cheap bagged garbage. Everything is priced very reasonable and you're paying for the quality. I also got a quiche lorraine. It was SO fucking delicious and pretty I can't even explain. It came with a huge salad and the quiche was perfection. The interior is so pretty and the workers here are so kind and helpful! They constantly smile at you which is such a good vibe.   Good food, beverages, people, atmosphere, and vibes!  I'll be spending all my money here :)",

We got the croque Rosalie - was ok and improperly reheated ( cold in the middle)- served with some wilted tomotoes. I got the French onion soup - bowl was $6.. not 1 shred of cheese in it just some croutons floating on top?! The cheese is the thing about french onion I love most so very disappointed .All the tables we tried to sit st were dirty and hadn't been wiped down . I don't think we will be back although there is good potential - management needs to step it up .",

Very simple but it gets the cute job done.   The only problem I had here was they forgot to put an almond croissant in my friends order. But that was easily remedied. Really it's just super solid place to get with friends.",

I am currently trying to eat a low-carb diet, and even though this is a French bakery, they were able to make me a fantastic salad with ham and cheese and a house made vinaigrette. Technically, the salad was also supposed to have egg, but it's not a big deal that they left it off. Their iced tea made with Earl Grey tea leaves was fantastic. I had a small bite of my friends croissant and it was probably the best croissant I've ever had. My total check for an iced tea and a salad was $10 and change. Considering the quality and the freshness, I thought this was a great deal. The service was also very good, and if this matters to you like it matters to me, their bathroom was clean and well lit.",

We shared the Croque Rosallie,  and it was absolutely delicious! Such flavor! And the croissant was so buttery and flakey! We enjoyed it so much, that we decided to go back for lunch! This time we shared the Centre sandwich...again, wonderful flavors and the homemade bread it is on just totally makes it amazing! We also shared the Quiche Chevre which was delectable...so light and creamy, with an excellent flavor and perfect crust! We also love their balsamic salad dressing! Can't wait to try more menu items from this place! The decor is cute and quaint. I just wish they had some soup on their menu...to me a nice cup of homemade soup is the perfect companion to a sandwich or salad!",

My girlfriend and I got there around 4pm, there was 2 other tables lounging around on their laptops. I was starring at the menu like a deer in headlights. Confused and overwhelmed with their menu. I asked the gentleman behind the counter to recommend and explain some of  the popular lunch items. The first thing I knew I wanted to order was their almond pie, but unfortunately I came too late that day and they had already sold out. I asked about the soup of the day, and again..... No more soup! :(  I finally settled and ordered:  Chevre Chaud (goat cheese pastry) Salad with a piece of melted Brie cheese. IF YOUR ARE A CHEESE LOVER... YOU WILL FALL INLOVE WITH THIS!!! I had two is my favorite cheeses together on one plate! It was heavenly!!!!  My gf ordered a Brie sand which. She said it was also really good!  I can't wait to go back and try other dishes! Maybe next time I should go earlier, before I'm too late again!",

They were a little busy.   We had a Brie and pesto sandwich, a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich and a ham and cheese croissant. They were all served with salad with teardrop tomatoes, shredded carrots and a yummy balsamic vinaigrette. There was no shortage of greens. The sandwiches were piled high with greens as well. Both sandwiches were delicious and served on fresh baked bread. The prosciutto and mozzarella with peppers was slightly superior. It had a little more balance. The Brie sandwich was tasty...rich and stinky with lots of melty Brie.  They were both a mess and absolutely impossible to eat without looking like a savage.   The menu is simple but sufficient. There's 4-5 sandwiches, 3 salads, quiche, soup and of course goodies. I had a scrumptious hazelnut praline latte. It was not too sweet and, of course, had a pretty heart in the inch of rich foam.   The food took longer than necessary to come out. But, again, they were busy. It's cute inside for sure. There's more seating than your average French bakery.   Food was good abs I'll definitely return.",

This is a great place to do homework or any type of work away from work. The owner, Jonathan, is a very nice guy and is more than willing to accommodate to any needs.  I recommend this coffee shop without reservations.",

We ordered to cups of coffee, \"Late\". and two pieces of pastry. ($12.25) We were given a number and was told the coffee would be sent over to our table shortly. The pastry was delicious.  After waiting at least ten minutes for the coffee, I want back to the check on it and the gal behind the desk told me that she is very busy and our coffee would take another ten to fifteen minutes. Apparently the owner is an excellent baker but is clueless about running this type of business. I don't know anyone that wants to wait 20+ minutes for coffee. Not me!",

The owner remembered me upon arrival, apologized for my previous experience, and did not charge me for my macaroons. I told him it wasn't necessary for him to do that but he insisted and even gave me a complimentary assorted macaroon box.  Aside from macaroons, I also got an almond croissant, regular croissant and an Americano. The croissant was perfect, light and flaky as it should be. The almond croissant was one of the better ones I've tried in Vegas. The macaroons are like little bites of heaven; perfect amount of filling, and the outside has a crunch to the bite but soft inside.  Once again, I appreciate the quality and flavors of the food. This is one of the better French cafes in Vegas.",

For the cost you get two wine tastings and all the cheese types you want, pick your own breads and crackers & fruit (grapes).  The tasting is about 1/3 glass full.  You can order a bottle or full glass if you wish.  After trying to be a connoisseur, and chatting up or listening to funny and great stories, you may start feeling full.  Those carbs do their expansion thing in the bellies pretty good.  Food for thought: Why in the world do the best tasting cheeses stink like heck though?  Swish with wine and don't talk directly at someone :P  Nice thing about the space in Rosalie is the cafe environment.  Yeah a bookshelf and comfy corner is in there.  But for big groups of 8-10 it's easy to pull tables and chairs together for a family gathering feel.  I recommend the tastings.  Keep a watch out for their postings on their tasting events.",

The tea was some of the best tea I had ever had. We wanted to buy some of the tea to make at home but we didn't ask if they sold it.  My husband had the butter croissant it was nice and flaky and tasted buttery.   I had the Almond Raspberry croissant, it was really sweet and seemed a bit over baked for my liking.   The inside of this cafe was cute they decorated it like a french cafe, there is a cute window where they have freshly baked goodies.  They also have a little private area perfect for a date although we didn't notice it until we had already been there a while.  I am definitely going back to have the tea and try another pastry.  They had several different french pastries the lemon tart looked delicious, that will be what I try next time.",

Their chocolate almond croissant was crispy on the outside and heavenly on the inside - best I've ever had! I look forward to spending my mornings here whether sit down or grab-n-go!",

We started off with free samples of almond croissants which were delicious. My son had the Madeleine which he enjoyed. He wanted a macaron but they only sold them by the dozen. I had the Tartine L'Americain and my wife had the Quiche. Both were  savory, and delicious. The quiche quality, texture and taste was above any others we've had around town. I had the Nutella S'mores Latte, she had the Hazelnut Praline Latte. Mine was pretty good. She said it was the best Hazelnut Latte she's ever had. They have a great variety of pastries to choose from. We will definitely be back and recommend you try it out.",

I came a second time early in the morning nearly 25 minutes after they open (7AM), and I didn't receive the greatest customer service. The employee serviced a girl after me because she wanted an assortment of pastries and I ordered a drink. Now, on to the drink - I get the Provence latte (lavender honey) and it is delicious, HOWEVER, it is incredibly overpriced. I do get a non-dairy milk and there is an upcharge for that (which is unfortunately to be expected) but there's also an entire $1 upcharge to make the drink iced. I'm sorry, but that just doesn't sit well with me. So now my regular sized latte (which has to be somewhere between 12-16oz) is nearly $7. As good as it is, I can't justify the expense which is super unfortunate because it is very good.",

I had expected seating for the 26 adults, who we expected, the table was set for 18?!  Drinks were ordered individually, at the table, but trickled in slowly and way after the food arrived upon the buffet table.  We had a wonderful shower, with great food and drink but I felt that the staff was overwhelmed by us, considering the place was open to the public as well.  Jonathan is conscientious about his product, so perhaps, that had something to do with the inconsistent flow.  Overall, we are happy we discovered this venue, the food is very good and drinks artistic, we enjoyed ourselves.",

    "text": "This review is only on a sandwich no pastry- which look AMAZING! I ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich. It was decent. In my own opinion, I want to mostly taste prosciutto in a prosciutto sandwich. Here, there was a lot of cheese and tomato to overwhelm the flavor, which I love don't get me wrong but it was too much. The mozzarella was too salty and I like my prosciutto to be the saltiest thing on the sandwich. Again just my take on it. I just love taste of prosciutto and theirs was soooo good I wanted even more and for it to be the star of the dish.There was a great salad around the rim of the dish and the dressing was really good!! Actually, fantastic. I'd definitely eat it again. The employees were so sweet and I love the atmosphere. The father and daughter ahead of me in line were both so nice and gave me opinions on what to order, which was so sweet knowing they support and love this place! It is definitely a home-y place and that is what sold me on it. Also, I got a free coffee refill! YUM. I'm definitely coming back to try to duck because the only reason it did not get five stars is because of the salty mozzarella(well and long wait time)! Definitely give it a try if you're in the area. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich though. I didn't know that coming in so I was annoyed but if you know ahead of time it makes it better:)",

    "text": "This review is based on one visit only. This used to be a 7-11, they did a nice job converting the space. It's simple and spacious (maybe even a little too bare and spacious). I got a few  macaroons and a tried their la madeleine cookie as well as the duck confit sandwich. The sandwich is a bit overpriced at above $12 and to be honest, it was not very good. The duck was kinda cold and dry and there wasn't much of it.  The sweets fared better. The macaroons, though small, were pretty good and reasonably priced at $1.10. I really liked the la madeleine cookie as well. Will probably be back to try some other pastries and maybe give the cheaper sandwiches a try, they are after all conveniently located close by...",

They have only been opened for 2 months and I wish this family owned business many years of success. Highly recommend.",

The customer service here is well above average.  Sometimes they are slow to make their drinks but it's not their fault that they are popular.  It gets busy so come early.  They just need to hire an extra hand part time just for the morning rush.  The food is phenomenal and Genuine French.  They have an excellent selection of coffee and the taste and presentation are all top notch.  Definitely worth it just for the Authentic French experience",

But, beyond that it is an authentic French experience smack in the middle of Sin City.  I can't recall a time where a dining experience was SO beautiful & SO delicious that I teared up over it. But, at Rosallie, it happened. It was as if all of the stuff of my foodie dreams had magically come to fruition in one perfect moment...wine, cheese, bread, quiche, walnut tart, fig jam, honey, candied pecans, blackcurrant cocktails, macaroons. Every single bite was better than the last.  Jonathan's service and attention to detail was flawless. It is clear that he is passionate and knowledgeable about French cuisine. It showed in every aspect of our meal and it made our experience truly spectacular.  On occasion, I am impressed enough my a restaurant to where I know I will be back. But, almost never do I plan my next 2 visits before I leave or even finish my meal. I already can't wait to go back. I want to try every single thing on the menu.  Rosallie has taken a coveted spot in my \"Top 3 Best in LV\".",

I had the Rosalie. It arrived looking so promising and delicious, it ended up being just mediocre. You see this melted cheese, bechamel sauce, you expected the ham and croissant to be hot and toasted. So was not the case. The ham in the middle was cold, and the entire meal was warm, creating a disappointing first bite.   I also ordered the coffee, which was decent. Nothing exciting, probably need to try the flavored espresso drinks next time.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is cute. I'd definitely go back again and give them another shot.",

    "text": "Nice authentic French coffee shop in the neighborhood. When they first opened, I used to see the owner working in the kitchen, behind the counter, serving customers. Talked to him about his passion of baking, etc. Later on, he was gone. Then I never saw him again. He hired two employees to take care of his business. I'm glad he is doing well!  The little pastries are made by him, displayed nicely on the counter or in the pastry case. Also, there are samples of tea leaves displayed on the counter under little glass domes. I never ordered tea, but  I tried their coffee. I love hazelnut cappuccino or latte, so I ordered it. I don't know if the coffee is not strong enough or just too much milk added to it, but it is not the best coffee I ever had. It tasted like milk.  The chocolate croissant  is very light, good flavor. It's much smaller size than you can find at other places. Probably I could easily eaten two of them. The almond croissant was a little bit dry. I am sure it was just a coincidence. The macaroons were delicious! I bought the little box containing 12 varieties of macaroons ($12.99)  I tried one of the breakfast item at one time: Quiche Lorraine (bacon) with organic greens on the side.  That was very different from our everyday breakfast, but I liked it. It was very refreshing! I had their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, also I liked a lot!  Free wifi is provided. There is a password on the wall. Also complimentary lemon water customers can enjoy, can be found on the service station area, next to the condiments.  I really like the separate section of reading area with comfortable couches. I saw people working on their laptops or reading magazines or books. The background music is very beautiful French music.   My recent discovery is that they are now serving wine, too!",

Finally got a chance to sample the food and have fallen in love with the madeleines and sandwiches, particularly the Est (brie cheese, tomato, pesto, and greens, all on a fabulous brioche bun).  I haven't camped out with a mug of tea yet, but as the colder weather settles in, I'm coming by more frequently for grab-and-go coffees, which are always just right.

    "text": "I've been here about two times now and I've had enjoyable experiences on both visits.   For our first trip, we tried their almond croissant, creme brulee latte, and an eclair that strangely reminds me of the Chinese pineapple bun pastry. The almond croissant was beautifully made -- buttery, flakey, and sweet. However, it is a little too sweet for my taste buds so I would probably recommend getting some coffee or tea with it. The creme brulee latte was pretty average for me. Perhaps it's because everything is sweet so the coffee just blended in with everything else. The eclair was fantastic. They had three different type of fillings: vanilla, caramel, or chocolate. We got the vanilla filled and it was really yummy. It was definitely on the sweeter side as well.  On our second visit, we got the same vanilla filled eclair. Instead of an almond croissant, we opted in for a regular croissant -- I do believe that it is better than the almond version just because it is not sweet at all. We also grabbed an Ouest (West) sandwich, which consisted of duck confit, sweet onion jam, and tomato. I have to be honest -- the sandwich didn't blow me away. It was just another sandwich to me .. and it was flooded with greens -- not that it's a bad thing. Or maybe I just can't appreciate a French sandwich!?!  Rosallie is a very cute place. It's very cozy and carries a warm atmosphere. If you want a place to just have some snacks, coffee, tea, etc with some friends, definitely consider Rosallie. The location is very convenient as it is off the 215 Rainbow exit.   I would definitely be back for their croissants! And I do hope to see more bakery/pastry items on the menu in the future.",

I am originally from London and I am grateful for small business like Rosallie, who bring a profound sense of warmth, culture and tradition into the local community here.   Rosallie for me is like stepping into a home away from home. Walking into the cozy aromas of freshly brewed coffee, the freshly baked pastries you could smell through the display, the quiet bustle you can hear from kind conversations with china plates and cups clinking in between. Samba music from the likes of Bebel Gilberto surround your thoughts. Wait a second. Where am I?  It is an escape. Whether you are catching up with a friend, or going on a first date or trying to find a good place to study. I urge you to try their Nord sandwich and Provence latte (with hints of lavender and honey) hands down best I have had! Grab a book from the bookshelf, put your phone away. Soak it all in.",

Whatever it was it looked like it wouldn't fill you up however it was so rich and full in flavor that it was enough for even me....  The Chipotle Chicken Sandwich was the other one and it was a bigger looking portion and was just as good.  As far as drinks we ordered the Creme Brulee Latte and the Green Passion Fruit Tea.

    "text": "I read somewhere that Rosallie had the best macarons in town, so we set off for the west side to judge for ourselves. First off, it's a lot more than JUST a bakery. Rosallie has a full menu of salads, sandwiches, and French cafe-type things like quiche. They also do wine by the glass, and selection seemed above average at a quick glance.  The ambiance is cute, and they've managed to make it cozier than its strip mall location suggests, including a free phone charging station, wifi, and lots of books. Prices were pretty high for desserts, but I kinda expected that: ~$1 each for the mini macarons or medium sized sugar cookies.   Most important: the macarons are delicious. We most enjoyed the caramel and pistachio, but lemon and raspberry were also delicious.   My complaints: macarons are only available in a multi pack of 12, including 2 chocolate, which we really didn't like at all. It would be great to be able to buy singles or at least set our own variety. Second, while they have a wide selection of loose teas, they don't really have any specialty tea drinks.   Overall, a super cute place with delicious cookies.",

And of course it doesn't hurt to have an assortment of baked goods, sandwiches, teas and coffee drinks, and so on. It always smells great inside.  One of my favorite items here is the Centre it's their delicious tasting chicken sandwich. I've had this many times. My only complaint would be that occasionally the bun is harder than I preferred. Another favorite is the Creme Brulee Latte served hot. I just enjoy it so much.   Honestly everything I've tried here I've enjoyed so if you're in the area you should definitely check it out. Just don't bring everyone with you because it's not a huge place and the last time I was there all tables were taken. I'd be back for sure.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of trying out this cute little french cafe this past Sunday. It did not disappoint! I had the Nord which was a smoked salmon sandwich garnished with a nice salad around it with a balsamic-esque dressing. I was torn between ordering the Nord and the Sud (a prosciutto sandwich) but the lady at the counter recommended the Nord. It was filling and light at the same time, with lots of flavor. They gave you an ample amount of smoke salmon and it had kind of a slaw type garnishing in it. I can't really explain the taste but it complemented the salmon really well. It sort of reminded me of a chipotle mayo slaw.   I also ordered their chocolate mousse brownie. It was very, very rich! It's definitely something I recommend you share with someone and also offset the sweetness with their amazing rose latte. It definitely balanced it out! I'm sure any of their lattes or coffees would compliment the chocolate mousse brownie but the Rose latte was perfection.   What I loved most was that Rosalie had this private little area off to the side with a few tables and some reading chairs to enjoy your coffee or pastry. It was nicely decorated and cozy which went with the french cafe theme. They have real marble tables which are perfect for taking that IG worthy photo of your meal/dessert/latte. They offered a lot of different varieties of desserts and baked goods as well as tea. So there's a little something for everyone. I will definitely be going back here!",

There's normal table seating as well as a section with couches and books if you want to lounge or do work for awhile. We got the quiche Lorraine, the croque Rosallie, one of their iced teas, and the rose mocha. The croque Rosallie was definitely the winner of the day, but everything was still delicious. The quiche crust was so good that I ate it by itself. I can't wait to have another rose mocha - the rosewater was great, and the little thing they put on top gave it a sour note that I loved. I didn't have the chance to get a pastry, but I'll be back either with friends or on a date night to try that raspberry chocolate tarte.",

You're welcomed by fresh pastries billowing over themselves behind glass. At least that was the case when I was one of their first customers. I literally ordered twelve pastries to go. From cinnamon rolls to almond croissants. We sat and ordered quiche and the Egg Au Gratin. Everything tasted delicious although I was expecting potatoes in the au gratin but I didn't care because it was so good.   They have teas, coffee, a selection of beer and wines. What's not to love. You order at the counter and then grab a table once you get a number from the cashier. You could grab your friends and make your way to this place or post up solo.   Big fan. Huge!",

Who would guess an authentic patisserie in this area?  They have been around for a while, and I wonder if the baker spent time in France to master the craft.  Other offerings: macarons, madeleines, St. Honore, cookies, and some fancier dessert pastries, light lunch beer and wine.  My kind of place. I'm stingy with my stars..this was as good as it gets.",

The partners here have another location in orlando florida called Winter Garden. Christof came to our table several times to make sure everything was to our liking. If you ever get tired of standing in line every day at Starbucks and want to really treat yourself to a very authentic european dining experience in a tastefully decorated and cozy area, be sure to check it out. Strip quality food without the parking & crowd hassles. Christof was the head pastry chef at Jean Philip at the Aria. And judging on our experiences here, you can tell. He is very customer centric and solicits feedback from all his customers. Not the cheapest but you really do get what you pay for in terms of freshness & quality.",

    "text": "[UPDATE 8/20/17: The owner did see this; I received a private message. I stand by my praise of various foods in this and prior reviews and my criticism of the service on this particular day. I will return and hope for a positive experience so that I can write a better review then, but I won't change my rating as of this time.]  Look, it's plain and simple. They fucked up.  I'm usually not so harsh on my ratings or reviews, but I think my dining companions were being far too generous to Rosallie based on their experiences, so I'm willing to drop the hammer with the justification that yes, \"I've experienced better.\" I have little sympathy when two employees look at the register and at the pastry case and then enter the wrong order in, which cost less and probably tasted worse than the item which I'd intended to order, so I'm not mincing words. (To be fair, it doesn't appear that the business owners use Yelp, but I still want to make sure that we're collectively making enough noise to be heard.)  For what it's worth, the food is quite good when they get it right. I've made a fair amount of visits without really bothering to update my review because my rating hadn't changed much, but I recall such pastries as the Madeleine ($1.50 last I checked) and Pumpkin Cannoli ($3.50, maybe seasonal) being quite delicious, and the Canele ($1.75) was pretty good if a little small. The Croque Rosallie ($7.90 then, reportedly now $8.30) was also a very strong breakfast sandwich when I had it last year, with a ham, onion, and mozzarella in a halved croissant, plus a fresh salad with a nice dressing and some delicious sliced oranges served as the garnish.  On my visit last weekend, I also highly enjoyed the Normandie Tartine ($9.20), which is more of a layered dough flatbread than an open-faced sandwich here. The Normandie in particular has Brie, onion, and tomato, with a small side salad and a little bowl with additional tomato.  It was pretty obvious that they were struggling with the huge crowd though, and the lack of knowledge of the food / register caused them to ring me up for an Opera cake ($4.90) rather than a passion fruit cake ($4.10) that I'd seen in the case. I didn't look at my receipt until after receiving my cake because I'd assumed that they'd gotten it right after taking their time, but they didn't, and I sighed and ate the cake anyway because it would've gone to waste otherwise. It's not a bad cake, with plenty of chocolate and coffee flavor, although I wasn't a fan of the ground nuts in one of the layers. It wasn't especially memorable in flavor intensity or sweetness though.  The double-shot espresso ($2.50) tasted fine and had sufficient caffeine, but it wasn't served piping hot. I found that odd at the time but shrugged and enjoyed not burning my tongue. I don't think that's how it's supposed to be presented though...  Thanks to Christie L. for letting me try a Chocolate Macaron (part of a $12/12 pc. tray). It's smaller than typical macarons and didn't have all that much chocolate flavor, but the textures were fine. However, I would rather save my macaron investment for a place with unique flavors, like Suzuya.  And for that matter, I'm able to get much more stunning and properly identified savory and sweet food at places like Cafe Breizh, or the various patisseries on the Strip. They know what they're doing.  Would I come back to Rosallie? Yes, probably. I'll have to watch everything like a hawk though and I sure as heck won't show up for a Sunday brunch (unless Christie organizes it again, then I'd say yes). They were fine when I visited at times during which they weren't so busy. Let's hope that the owners haven't forgotten about us in the midst of their Florida expansion.",

    "text": "First time in review. It's a cute place. It is. Annnnd the pastries are all so beautiful and appealing. So if you ask me will I ever return? YES! I would love to give their pastries my attention, and perhaps try something else...BUT never again their sandwich. Why?  The buns they use is way too thick.   The hubs and I met up with a group of other foodies for brunch. I've had this place bookmarked forever, but coming from the north we've never been able to make it just because of time constraints and opportunity. Opportunity and time wasn't a problem this day...and so we arrived.   Back to food. You stand in line, order, get a number, and have a seat at whatever table suits your interest given its availability. I felt like I was standing in line forever with 3 people ahead, but then again...hunger was real so idk which part of me was doing the thinking. We finally order and I tell the cashier what I wanted, and she then asks me to show her which one off the menu. ::crickets::. So I opened the menu and pointed it off to her. A Nord, an Est, and may you throw in a jam danish. Off to our seats we went.  Then we waited. And waited. Those that were there sooner than us got their meals, finished it, and even had to go. Kinda awkwardly waiting. But I was patiently okay! I was out sans the kids, socializing...im good! But we waited. It got to the point where one person in the group walked up to check on our dishes to find they were just sitting waiting to get picked up and served.   The sandwiches proved to have been waiting because the buns used were fricking hard. People, I couldn't even slice through it with my butter knife without my bun shifting and cracking. So I knew cutting through it wasn't going to work. Not only was it hard, I couldn't even get my mouth to grip on that thing. Quite frankly, there seemed to have been more bun than \"nord\".  Refer to pictures to get a better understanding of what we were served.   On top of that, I feel like I got served a plate full of spring mix. I ate my sandwich open faced, but didn't eat the bottom half. Someone joked about my food being rabbit food because it was just a plate of greens. My husband's sandwich looked almost worst than mine. His looked overly toasted, burnt...whichever. Again, refer to pictures.   But I made it through whatever I could and my husband out of upbringing...finished his despite the woes. The jam danish was the best part of our meal, it was beautiful to look at...but it ended up tasting basic. It was flaky in a stale way. Sigh, if that makes sense. I just felt like everyone I know who has been here ten million times has such a great rave for it...but first impression--disappointing.  I certainly wouldn't mind trying other things on their menu. What i do know for sure is I'll never order a sandwich from there again...id rather opt for something else. I won't count them out...just not a place I'd drive across the city for. Gatherings and what not...sure why not.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly if bringing the kids. I'd say leave the kids though. Might catch a better vibe over a pastry and latte without 'em.  Enjoy!",

Parking is blah. And what passes for outdoor seating is a joke.  But...you were waiting for this, it has some really great flavors going on. Rose mocha coffee? You bet that tastes every bit as good as it sounds. And I did detect honest to goodness truffle butter in the eggs au gratin. The La Reine was this buttery pastry concoction full up with ham, mushrooms and other savory goodies (you just need to try it for yourself). I can foresee many a trip here to sample through their menu.  I did like how the seating was cordoned off by little walls. The paint needed some texture, but the little touches were pleasant. And it blocked off the middle aged  ladies flashing selfies of themselves and feeling Continental. No offense to any True Lady.  I'd say this is a hidden gem, tucked away in retail hell, but well worth the effort to get to. Buy me a croissant and coffee to thank me.",

    "text": "Your basic simple and delicious French comfort food in a nice quiet setting.  We have been here three or four times for breakfast with friends.  The coffee is freshly brewed and the heavenly croissant so buttery and flaky.   We were luckily to be greeted by their manager Jose each time with his big smile.   We have also tried their salmon, and duck dish and it is highly recommended.  They make their Macaron fresh daily and we bought some as gift and for our enjoyment.  Parking could be tight depending on time of day.  Nov 13:  Not sure if it is the beans, the fineness of the grind, the Half & Half, or the temperature of the water... etc  Our usual French pressed coffee tasted sour.  The server offered to have it replaced but never made good on his promise or came back.  Sorry, but we will take a time out.",

The creme brulee actually has the burnt sugar on top of it, which is amazing! Best croissants and madelines. I love that they have a nice charcuterie, cheese and tart spread for breakfast, makes for a lovely time. I've also had their salads, also very delicious!",

We had them add scrambled eggs and the flavor was to die for.  For a sweet treat we had a fresh apple turnover.  Karen was excited with the amount of loose leaf tea options for hot tea.  I opted for the blended coffee and it was terrific.  Based on the food alone the Cafe deserved five stars but when you consider The ambience, I was wishing there was a sixth star option. Between the decor and the music you could close your eyes and feel like you are on a secluded corner somewhere  in France with the one you love.",

Like you said, yelp is to review businesses and not use it for personal vengeance which you just did. I wasn't insulting you by saying Mc Donald would be a better place for you to go, and looking at your past preview I was absolutely right about that.\"  I am posting this here because I believe in transparency and I believe Yelpers should understand who the owner is. My comments are here for all to see, while the owner privately messages me and insults me (I am blocking him after I post this). I am surprised at the owner's reaction considering his \"professional\" background. I don't think he handles criticism well, or maybe the stress from running his own business has made him too quick to react rather than to hear what is said. Regardless, I am done posting about this matter and I will not be sending any of my friends to Rosallie. I wish his business well and hope future Yelpers see him for who he really is. ( Maybe he is peeling too many onions )   c'est la vie",

It feels barren inside as the decor at this place is very low budget & plain... There really is nothing here which feels warm, French & inviting.   The girl who took our order was nice. The table was not clean & we had to wipe it off before sitting down.   The coffee was not anything I would order again. My husband had the latte & it was tasteless & I had French Vanilla Latte & there was not any coffee taste, but there was some creamy vanilla.  Very little foam on top. There was a pretty heart type design.   You order at the counter & they bring it to you. That's the service Level. No follow up, so it is much like a Fast Food place. Except the prices are more like a sit down restaurant.   Lentil soup was bland & had no texture.  Would not recommend. It was served hot.   Salad with quiche was tasty. Good dressing & they put on a nice quantity.   Quiche Lorraine was hot & tasted pretty good.   Quiche Chevre (goat cheese) was smooth & bland. Not something I would order again. It was ok & came out hot. Crust was bland. I had to add salt to make it palatable.  I love French food & was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  Will try again if I hear that it has improved.",

A little sweet but if you like coffee .... and creme brule.... you ought to love yourself and drink one.   The croque Rosalie was great as well! But I'll definitely be coming back just for that coffee, some macaroons/pastries, and some pleasant reflection time without my cell phone. The atmosphere is busy without feeling like you are lost in the crowd. Friendly and very helpful staff - you can tell they work hard back there!

The Decor is so cute and very French. Their quiche is soft and airy, like an egg souffle. The nord, which is basically a salted salmon sandwich taste really refreshing. The latte was good, but I wished it had more of a coffee taste. The charcuterie plate was awesome, however, I would have preferred pate on it versus two variety of cheese. The chocolate croissants was yummy and flaky.  I can't wait to go back to this place.",

It was my first time in and the staff was very patient with me as I looked over my options, and happily answered all my questions and offered suggestions. The chef even came out to talk about his lovely creations!  As a chef myself, I can totally relate to the way his face lit up when describing the pastries...that passion is rare and yet it is the most important quality in a good chef! It really shines through, you can tell when something is made with love vs just to collect a paycheck.  I loved everything I tried! I was reccomended the almond raspberry croissant, and it did not dissapoint!  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, with a perfectly crispy flaky exterior and a lovely moist interior.  Not dry at all! I also tried their regular almond croissant which was also lovely! These are the best stuffed croissants I have EVER had.  I also tried a madeline, which was delicious!  Who knew cake could be so tasty on its own without any frosting?! And last but not least, I tried the special easter nest cake, a lovely light cake surrounded with lovely whipped cream and topped with fruit, a maccaron, and malt eggs. It was so delicious! Not too sweet, just perfect! I love that after eating half of each item I am surprisingly not feeling heavy or bleh, like I usualy do after indulging in a lot of sweets. This leads me to believe they use real ingredients from scratch and minimally processed! I can't wait to go back and try their coffee and hot food, and alllll the pastries!",

I like to get the ham and cheese croissant with a french press. Honestly I think the food is okay, and also a bit pricy for the portion. But if you're looking for a healthier alternative this place is a good option. I like coming here more so for the atmosphere than their menu.",

There were eggs, salade, and croissant, and bread. It was more than enough for two. The French Press coffee was well prepared, and flavorful, and my daughter adored the hot chocolate, though I would say it was probably too much chocolate (if that can even be a thing).   I have been anxious to go back for an evening course, and some wine, as their selection was interesting, and their savory foods look equally delicious.",

I wish they'd gone farther and replaced the old flooring and boring white ceiling tile. The display area is nicely done and the baked items are impressive. I don't know if they bake them here or not but this is the difference between small shop and Starbucks \"baked\" goods. The quiche wasn't the best but the eggs au gratin was tasty. Lattes are good. Not quite perfect yet but better than Starbucks. Would recommend trying this place out if you're on west side.",

(1) First, the guy who was taking orders kept messing up and needed help with their computer. He had already taken a long time just taking the orders of the two people in front of me. When it was my turn, he was still flubbing and needed to find someone to help him with the computer. There were also no greeting from anyone in the cafe when I entered and when I started placing my order. I ordered a croissant, a cake, and macarons. (2) The lady who took my order, was rude, and suddenly left to get my order ready. I had to ask her if I needed to sign anything. She rudely faced the iPad to me so I could sign. Then she gave me three plates, one for each item I ordered. She did not offer to help me, or asked someone to help me. None of the workers offered to help me carry three plates as I picked a table to sit on. When I was about to eat, I realized that the croissant was cold. Not room temperature, but cold. Luckily, another one of the workers was serving coffee someone next to me, so I asked her if they normally serve bread that is cold. She said she could warm it up. She came back within a few minutes. (3) The croissant, cake, and macarons were nothing special. As other people have stated, the food is something you can get somewhere else. (4) I also went to the bathroom, and it was dirty. All of these reasons-- terrible customer service, mediocre food, and dirty bathroom--led me to not recommend this place to anyone. Please save your time and money and go to a different French cafe.",

They offer a great selection of baked goods.  From cakes to croissants to cookies and macrons and macaroons!! They also offer a great savory selection of things like quiche, sandwiches and salads.    The staff here is quite friendly.  Always willing to offer suggestions. Did I forget to mention they make an amazing cup of offer?  The espresso is great too!  If you are looking for a great meal at reasonable prices, check this place out!",

The restaurant is sectioned off into 2 sections, one section with tables and another section with comfortable couches with a bookshelf stacked with books.  They also have free Wi-Fi & a free charging station for your electronic devices.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I had their Centre, which is their oven roasted sandwich, which was plated beautifully. I also had their pomegranate mijito iced tea... Perfect on a hot summer day of 108 degrees in Vegas.   I will definitely go back to Rosallie!",

We are both french and I wanted a traditional french cake for her special day :) Ordered a fraisier for 20 The Fraisier was gorgeous, the Chef Pastry did such a beautiful detailed job! Chocolate butterflies, strawberries cut like little rose and added some sliced almond around the cake. BEAUTIFUL, gorgeous and Delicious! If you order in advance you can talk to the Pastey Chef and he can bake anything you wish!!! Next time I will order a Napoleon!!! Very pleased with the birthday cake, guest enjoyed it and we only left a slice for birthday girl breakfast (damned it lol) It was light, flavorful. Feel like we were eating clouds of strawberries   Tomorrow when you wake up you must try this French Bakery on Rainbow and Patrick (near 215) the decor is very frenchy, cozy and well decorated. Pastries are fresh and baked there! I enjoy there selection of teas.  instead of going get some pastries at Jean Philippe, try this great place outside the strip. This morning I ordered some pastries for my office since it was Christmas! Team was all excited and devoured the croissant, apple turn over, chocolate croissant...   bon appeti",

On my past visit, my boyfriend ordered a Croque Rosallie which was absolutely delicious and I ordered a green tea latte and a cheese danish.   Upon receiving my latte, I was a bit confused due to the lack of green hue in my cup. I double checked with the cashier and barista that I had received a green tea latte and they advised me that my drink was correct. I don't know about you but matcha green tea is green not white.   My latte tasted and look like just steamed milk. Starbuck's green tea latte is even better than what I had.",

Their pastry display puts me in an internal predicament knowing I don't have a large enough stomach to try every single baked good. Everything just looks so delicious! Their sandwiches, especially the centre, are great. The bread on them has the thinnest crunchy crust and softest inside with the right amount of chewiness. Almond croissants and fruit tarts are to die for. I had the coconut white chocolate (I think) latte the three day and it was scrumptious. Will definitely come back here for breakfast while getting some work done. You should too!!",

This place gets packed quick and it is seat yourself/order at the counter set up. The decor is eclectic, unique, and reminiscent of classic French fused with shabby chic. We opted for a quiche lorraine, salmon quiche, fruit tarte, lemon tarte and two glasses of champagne. Salmon quiche had me second guessing my choice until I dug in and finished it to the last bite. It was cooked to perfection and there was no sign of overt \"fishy\" taste or smell. Everything in the dish melded well together. Just as awestruck I was by their delicious food and incredibly scrumptious and fresh fruit tarte, I was equally amused by their decor. The staff was very friendly and the owner came by and said hello toward the end of our meal ensuring we had a satisfactory meal and experience at this restaurant. This is one of those spots that I want to keep to myself, but its just cruel to keep away from others, especially those who enjoy French bistro-style food. I would highly recommend.",

Also, they only have coffee and tea for drink options... so having some non-fat milk for the coffee would be super helpful.  Their staff seem pretty helpful, however, I mentioned to them today that I had a party of 5 coming for lunch.  I had to ask them if I could move some of the chairs, tables around.

You can taste the butter and it's very authentic.   Jonathan, the owner, is often present and he is just so warm, welcoming, and does everything right. Customer service is top notch.",

    "text": "We found this joint down the road near our church, so we decided to stop by and try it out.  The sign outside says Le French Cafe. I think they are still modeling the place because I heard some drills walking into the place.  When we walked in it was very open and welcoming.  I was drawn in my the itty bitty macaroons, costing $1.10 a pop.  Pass.....  We ordered the Ouest $12.90 and the Country plate also $12.90.  So for this price, I'm expecting a lot.  As I am looking around at everyone else's plate, I think I have already set myself up for disappointment.  There was myself and my infant daughter, so the only place we could sit was a table that had not yet been cleaned.  I had to request for the plates to be cleared for us to eat.  There were only 2 people working at the time, but its not like I would expect more for a little cafe.    Our meals were okay, for a snack, but the prices were a bit too high for me, hence my 3 stars.  I see that there are people that reviewed their Croissants, so next time I shall try that.",

Fresh crossiant. Flaky and buttery. Pretty good sized too. Wonder when they make it? Would be amazing to have a freshly baked croissant *_*   Quiche Chevre Salade - Tomato, goat cheese, and spinach quiche on top of a spring salad. Egg is light and fluffy. I know quiche doesnt require flour for preparation, at least not in the egg portion but i cant seem to shake the feeling of some like \"undercooked flour texture/feeling\". Expected the quiche to have a little more flavor with the goat cheese and tomato to give some freshness but seemed mildly plain. At least overall, i felt it was healthy? XD   Not a bad place. Location is fairly convenient, near the 215. Hope they will come out with more fresh bakery options and things for the menu in the future",

Decided to take a look and see if John Curtas and Michael Uzmann, local reviewers  have any idea what they are talking about when they said they love this restaurant  Honestly, when I walked in, the decor is a little bland, a little boring, so assumed was going to be a disaster.   However, I was pleasantly pleased by the Quiche Lorraine. Not going to do a full review, but while they wont win any awards for plating, it was very traditional, very French, and was happy to see the quiche made correctly, a little perfectly undercooked instead of the horrible fluffy egg crap americans make and call \"quiche\" or something.  I will going back for sure and trying some of the pastries to see if they are as good as everyone says.",

As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.  Quaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.  I love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly.   I sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home.   I'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't.   I wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!",

The line could have been better organized we were just standing there shrugging our shoulders near the cash register wondering if someone was going to come over and charge us or if it was something you pay for at the end? After someone finally came over and rung us up we were handed plates to get some cheese. Good selection of cheeses offered here and the breads were good too. I came back recently for brunch with friends. Service started out good but then changed. When my order came I had a smaller drink than the menu described, I asked for a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, and there was no jam or butter on my plate as the menu stated comes with it. After saying something to the girl working I was quickly brought butter and jam but my croissant and drink didn't get corrected. The breads and jam were good I really liked that and the croissant was flaky and delicious. I do wish my order came as it was supposed to I had been looking forward to trying the much talked about chocolate croissant here for months. Guess I gotta keep waiting. Some others in our group had to wait a really long time for their orders which was just sandwiches and they did complain of the bread being hard. I guess the owner was out of town and of the only 2 people working... it turned out to be the girls first day. They could have said something when we first arrived since the brunch was planned in advance to just simply give us a heads up that they might have some hiccups. The menu has a bit of something for everyone but I have to admit I was surprised to not see a traditional croque monsieur or madame on the menu since pretty much that's what people would expect to find at a French cafe. Their take on it is the croque Rosallie and it is damn good tho.",

According to Jonathan who is the owner he told me his dishes are inspired from his childhood home in France dishes like Chevre Salad, Quiche, Croquettes and sandwiches made on freshly baked French bread.   I've been here quite a few times and these are the things I've tried: The Nord sandwich is popular which consists of smoked salmon, capers, sweet onion and cucumber it was simply fabulous and healthy.   The Quiches are light, fluffy and delicious.  The Gazpacho soup is awesome, i can eat this everyday!  (Soup Verte) avocado, cucumber, zucchini, onion bell pepper and basil).   The staff was friendly and provided great customer service. Jonathan is a terrific host, very nice person, we got along pretty fast.     I told him I read his story in the paper and it's what made me drive to his cafe.  He was so pleased, he explained to me in detail how the name Rosallie came about, it was the name of the landowner who sold the farm house from his homeland Southern France. The name brought luck to his parents, so that's why he named the cafe Rosallie.   Conversations like that is why I comeback to his cafe, I just like meeting great people!  Rosallie is an wonderful cafe and I recommend this place to anybody!",

It's a good place for studying or socializing meals (and a plus with occasional French songs mixed Bubble-like songs, along with some French customers having their conversation).   Plugs are almost everywhere. Large window areas that brightens up the place. All tables are spacious from each other. There's a section with lounge chairs, and another table area that's to itself (great for group with a window wall). Bring headphone if you're studying in case there's a crowd like my current visit ( they're pretty loud being social and fun, but everything else is pretty calm )... There's patio seating, and I don't see any umbrellas.  The counter area is filled with pastry options (They're huge too!) you don't normally see, like Meringue bags. All teas are leaves/Herbal/it's not from a tea bags. They have smoothies and wine selections (they have a little glass wine room...it's so cute!) Their sandwiches are HUGE. The Chipotle chicken was delicious and excellent in quality (I ate half and now I have dinner also).",

    "text": "Although many love to tout the \"cool\" Chefs doing more daring food from DTLV to the 'burbs, there is perhaps no place that shows how far Off Strip dining has come than Rosallie, Jonathan Pluvinet's re-built 7-Eleven on South Rainbow continuing to outpace every other similar concept and single-handedly redefining French Bakeries in the Valley since August of 2015.  Truly a tale of skill and determination, 'Le French Cafe' since expanding to Florida, it was early Saturday morning that General Manager Christophe was found overseeing the Restaurant on its fourth anniversary, no special celebration but business as usual from a space more welcoming now than ever with a menu that continues to grow.  Located at 6090 South Rainbow Boulevard, letters on the facade beginning to peel from Southern Nevada's perpetual sun, it was almost entirely of old favorites that Breakfast was comprised, the lone novelty a Chocolate Chip Cookie with crisp rim and chewy center given a boost by crunchy Chocolate Pearls.  Still doing steady business during Sin City's slow season, several regulars making their way through and greeted by name, it was with house-blended Coffee and eight Pastries that Breakfast got started, Jonathan's Palmier shattering with Sugar and awash with Butter while an Apple Croustade and Apricot Danish each feature a lot of Fresh Fruit amidst flaky, laminated layers.  Offering a small library and private room with hand built furniture, both welcoming guests to sit and stay a while, it was after cracking the Crust of an individually sized Tart that similar flavors were found amidst a peerless Croissant, Rosallie's best item with or without Raspberries arguably without equal stateside while Bostock labeled as \"Blueberry Brioche\" sees Christophe's time at Jean-Philippe shine through using the same Loaf he created for Jean Georges Steakhouse.  Not about to leave without more Brioche, three golden slices baked and topped with Nutella plus pure Maple Syrup, those seeking something savory should not forgo the Croque Rosallie featuring one of those faultless Croissants topped with imported Ham, Housemade Bechamel and Mozzarella Cheese.  FIVE STARS: Always a case of the best getting better, this visit to the corner of Rainbow Boulevard and Patrick Lane finding Le French Cafe still pushing as it enters year five, Rosallie remains a cozy respite with the sort of environment, service and Cuisine one simply doesn't find many places these days.",

It didn't have that awkward taste of espresso shots sitting after it's get pulled. My favorite part about this place was the food! My sister and I bought a french toast with a nutella drizzle and a L'Americaine. The bread for the french toast was delicious and a touch of Nutella made it more amazing. It also came with a side of syrup if that strikes your fancy. The L' Americaine was perfectly balanced with bacon and cheese with a perfectly poached egg on top! It also came with a mini side salad and some seasoned tomatoes!   If you're a coffee lover don't be surprised if you're not wow'd by the coffee taste. This place is definitely known for their food.",

I didn't think the customer service was very good. One employee was welcoming but I received the cold shoulder from another. The restaurant decor seemed a half done. The area of the shop closest to the parking lot looked nice but the area in the back could use a little bit more attention.    The food itself was good. I, personally, didn't feel like it was something I couldn't have received elsewhere. I think they could work on the ambiance & theme of the place to make it more memorable & enjoyable.   This place isn't bad! I just felt like it was lacking in customer service and uniqueness/character.",

The dining area is broken up into several sections. The decor with comfortable wood french country chairs provides comfortable seating. In the rear is a lounging area with a sofa and table. The utensils and water are also self serve.  I ordered the special which was Salmon Quiche. Also French Onion Soup. I prefer a soup with a rich hearty broth, caramelized onions and lots of gooey cheese. All of these were lacking. Also there was way to much bread. The Quiche comes with a nice salad of mixed greens. The Quiche was cut into two slices and was very tasty. The portion size along with the salad was perfect for lunch.  Overall the lunch was OK with the soup not being as good as other cafes in town.",

    "text": "What a cozy little space with a French flair. I have enjoyed Rosallie's three times now and have enjoyed all my visits. My first visit happen to be in the month of December so due to the holidays, there was a holiday charm that filled this space.  Rosallie is easy to find located on the corner of Patrick and Rainbow and I thanks to many previous Yelpers check ins, I finally made it. The restaurant is a nice size with seating in the main room along with an additional room for overflow and it really does get busy here. What I like most is the reading/study/work nook they provide. So intimate and cozy. I can myself curling up on the couch with a good book and a cup of their rose mocha!   The menu is not too big, but the choices are many. They feature salads, quiche, sandwiches, croissants, french desserts, assorted coffee's and tea's. The first time I came, I tried the Quiche Chevre. The crust was so light and fluffy and the spinach was delicious with the goat cheese and tomato. I also drank a pot of their Peach Green Tea which was piping hot and warmed me up. I was with a large group of ladies and the service was very attentive. Once the server began speaking French, it made me wish when I stepped outside that I would see the Eiffel Tower again!  The second time I came I enjoyed the Centre Sandwich which consists of Chicken, chipotle spread, and melted mozzarella cheese along with a side salad. No complaints here. Juicy chicken with a mild kick at the end of each bite. The Rose Mocha I drank was a perfect accompaniment to this meal.  I haven't had the opportunity to try out their French pastries or desserts yet, but Rosallie is now a regular spot for me to stop at to relax, chat with a friend and enjoy a few simple pleasures.   Rosallie, you are so delicieux!",

But their fresh presentation of pastries call you over and gaze upon.  Your eyes don't fool you.  They taste as wonderful as they look.  After the hard decision of what to order, the friendly staff will take your order and bring it out when it's ready.    My close foodie friend had set up a wonderful brunch for a great group of women.  Of course that means I can sample more than just one item from the kitchen.  We opted to share two of the specials: the Tartiflette Quiche as well as the Brioche French Toast.  The quiche was so amazingly done with the potatoes, cheeses and fluffy egg concoction.  Every bite had the light layer of crust. Simply delightful.  The Brioche French Toast had a light drizzle of strawberry. It was very decadent which I almost felt guilty eating.  But you only live once! I enjoyed every bit of it.    I can't write my review without mentioning the Chocolate Almond Croissant.  The fresh filled almond wonder gave me a huge smile of joy.  Flaky and layered with almond is just what the doctor ordered.    For our large group, Rosallie displayed attentive service.  This was my first brunch enjoyed here and I look forward to many more.

French with a cottage flair theme with lots of croissant , Tarts and macaroons, sandwiches,Expresso, latte  and their signature dish was their Quiche.   The operation of the cute place is you walk up and order your food  and the cashier will give you a cute figurine with a number on it.  I am not a big fan of Quiche but I did order their sandwich Centre which is their sandwich highlight. I loved it! To Drink I had their Vanilla French Latte. Very Strong and I am still awake !  To even add more legitimacy to the French Atmosphere, French Toast, French Waiter! That's right! Our waiter is from France and has a legit French accent and can speak French! Made my morning and just hearing it made feel like I was in a cafe in Paris.   Cute spot to bring a casual date or brunch with the girls! Definitely would come back!",

The pastry and dessert cases have always been full of both delicious and beautiful treats. The variety is nice too, everything from chocolate croissants to tarts to turnovers. For those looking for something more hearty try the breakfast quiches, sandwiches, or French toasts. The menu also features a large selection of coffees and teas. Savory lunch options are also on the menu, but I can't speak to those. More reason to keep returning.   On my most recent visit I came with a group of 12. The gentlemen I reserved the table with was helpful and made the process easy. When we arrived we had a large table in the corner held for us. He added to the ambiance by speaking French and chatting with our group.   Highlights from my visits have been flavored lattes, Tartiflette Quiche, croissants, Brioche French toast, and Eggs au Gratin.",

However, now my go to is their Nutella tart. It is omg so delicious! There's a bit of a crunch and just enough sweetness that it makes it perfect. It's about $5 but it's well worth it. The ordering line can be a bit confusing as people stand in line to be seated and to order so it gets to be a bit of a clusterf-. One time I had a customer in front of me talking to another employee but the employee working behind the counter was waiting for this customer to order so I ended up standing there for a good 10 minutes even though I just wanted my Nutella tart!  They are always posting on IG which def works in their favor. For example, they now have pumpkin pies and guess who picked one up today! I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure it's delicious. Overall, it's a good place to have a bite to eat and grab coffee if that's how you roll.",

My favorites are the traditional croissants, almond croissants, apple tart and their la provencale.   Coffee is also good here but sometimes a little too sweet imo. That's a personal preference though. Next time I'll ask for less sweet if possible.",

Upon entering you get the great smell of pasties as it fills your nostrils and floats you to the glass display.    Butter croissant was light, fluffy, and just the right amount.  It flaked off nicely as I tear into it and melted in my mouth like it should.  Highly suggested.  Almond Raspberry croissant was a little dry and overly sweet.  My wife and I was a little disappointed, but it might work for others who likes super sweet pasties.  It just didn't work for us.  Ordered the tea press Pomengrante Mojito green tea and so glad we did.  This was super delicious as the flavor was perfectly blended.  This is a must try if you're nearby or feel like driving around Las Vegas to get away from the strip for a few hours to relax.  Keep yelping fellow yelpers. SYOY!",

I reminded one server that I had been waiting for it, another came and checked if they had brought it out yet... my party of 4 had then finished their coffees and food. We went back inside to remind them after 40 minutes and finally the cappucino comes out with the manager who told me, \"next time let us know you're outside.\" Which I did... 4 times.

Regardless, the food was great and I didn't really care much about the decor and ambiance because I came hungry.   What I ordered: -Ham and cheese croissant: warm, light and fluffy with a small side salad with oil/balsamic vinegar dressing ($6.90). I would order this again. It's not greasy and heavy like most ham and cheese croissants, nothing like the ones at donut shops.   -Country Plate: comes with a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a European breakfast and it looks exactly how it does in the menu photo. (12.90)  -black coffee: ok, a little on the bitter side  Service was decent, no complaints. You order and pay at the register and a gal brings you your order to the table.   I'd come back, but not rushing to come back.",

I love their walnut tart.  This was a first for me as I have tried many different types of tarts but never walnut until now!  I actually flew one home for this past Thanksgiving to share with my family. That is how much I love their tart.  It is not too sweet and is beautifully made.   The other favorite for me is their Chocolate Almond Croissant.  Some of the filling spills out as it bakes making the edges something I love to eat last. Delicious!    The pastry chef and owner is very pleasant as for the rest of the staff it has been a hit and miss.  The place is wonderfully decorated with a vintage French motive and offers cute seating and an overall an enjoyable experience!",

Greeted by the barista but was never offered a menu until another guy walked into our confused gaze on the chalk board consisting only drinks.  We ordered the Nord smoked salmon sandwich along with red onions and capers. Salad was a bit over dress for me personally. Beautifully plated, sandwich was okay.  The man recommended their most popular quiche. I wish it was cheesier? The consistency of it was runny like an egg custard. I've never been to Paris, so I can't comment on if that's how it's supposed to be. But I've had quiche else where and it was definitely not like that.   Lastly the charcuterie. $14.95 I got 4pcs of proscuitto, 4pcs of salami, 2 options of cheeses that tasted very basic, and few olives etc. to me, it was definitely overpriced for what it is.   It was a cute place,  I liked the atmosphere, would probably be back when I see my dentist in the next plaza. Didn't try any desserts, hopefully the pastries are more impressive than the lunch menu.",

It's a cute quaint place that has a pretty cute rustic French country decor.They also  have a really cool see thru glass wine cellar! Super cool! There is also small area with a sofa and chairs with a bookcase that makes it look and feel cozy comfortable to sit and drink with ur besties,  which I did even as we ordered some snacks with our lattes!  The Girls  really liked their lattes , I think that day I had a red velvet or hazelnut? It was delicious. I also ordered the salmon sandwich which came with a salad, that was yummy too! I also had their quiche which I shared with a friend, it had 2 pieces, good quantity and quality  for the price here!  We also had some of their desserts,it tasted fresh and oh so decadently rich and delicious! We cudnt finish the 2 desserts between my 2 besties and I so we had that to go, for my kids to finish, and they commented it was one of the best deserts they've had! Lol   Overall, I've alway had a great time when I go there with my girlfriends , so whenever my other set of besties from out of town or out of of the neighborhood want to go to a place that has good eats and cute atmosphere, this has been my Togo place, for my girlfriends and I!",

The almond croissant is different than any other in town. The denser, crunchier exterior may surprise some, but the flavors are still excellent. Many have raved about the walnut pie and I can confirm that it is excellent. It has such a subtle sweetness that makes it perfectly acceptable to eat for breakfast. Macarons are perfection. Delicate, crispy exteriors that give way to chewy and light interiors. On the sweeter side, their chocolate raspberry tart is pure, creamy chocolate overload with hints of tartness.",

The people who work there are incredibly nice, but the service is dreadful.  The place is small, and usually crowded.  And because it takes so long to get your food, people park at their tables for hours.  Also, the entire order doesn't get served at the same time, or not even close.  You end up with people watching each other eat, like this is a new spectator sport.  And no matter how much you like your meal-mates, it gets awkward.  The first eater has the guilt of knowing the others are hungry and envious of your food.  The last eater has to rush, knowing that everyone else is dying to leave, having already chatted, waited, eaten and drank.    While I really like this food, I do not enjoy going there because of the service.",

If your looking for an economically priced place for breakfast or brunch you'll like it here. Service is great and friendly too.",

We were there on a Saturday around 12:30 pm. It was not busy but had a steady flow of to go orders. The counter staff was friendly and efficient. The food server from the back was a little confused and had very bad English but she was very nice. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other items. The almond croissant was flaky and buttery. The ham and cheese croissant cam with a side salad and was equally delicious. The sandwich that comes on a roll is a little too hard for my tastes, but it was still good. The fruit tart was the traditional with an almond filling rather than a custard.",

I ordered a small croissant and bread plate for my meal, which was all really good as well. My wife ordered a quiche, which was not cooked properly (under-cooked).   Cost: I felt the cost was very reasonable for what we ordered.  Staff: The staff was very pleasant.  Cleanliness: Overall, it seemed fairly clean, however two incidents make me question that: 1) the person taking and handling money at the register stepped aside to show someone preparing the food what he meant by putting a paper between a plate and croissant. Three croissants, zero hand washing. 2) A couple at a table beside us asked for to go cups. They were brought over and one of the cups fell on the floor. Without hesitation, the server picked up the cup from the floor and put it on the table for the customer to use.   As a side note, if anyone from Rosallie reads this, either add some acoustic panels or stop banging the $h*t out of everything you touch. This is a large open space, all the walls in the middle are half-walls, and all these sounds bounce around eventually making it to your patrons in loud and piercing splendor.  I *really* want to like this place and return, but honestly, I doubt that's going to happen.",

I was charged .90 cent over than what I expected to pay!!! The workers have NO personality, but the owner or cook. he is very nice and friendly. its a clean place good hours, and they take cash or credit. Since my 3 experiences though I personally will NOT be back. over priced for the quality and quantity you get!!!!",

So, I opted for an iced ceylon tea \"with a little milk\".  What I ended up with was slightly tinted water/milk combo that was delivered to me in less than two minutes. My point in telling you that - you have to STEEP the tea. It's part of the whole \"tea preparing process\"... (uh, what happened to being 'authentic'?)  OK... so I won't get \"to go\" anything from there anymore except pastries.  But I will definitely be back because, again, AMAZING PASTRIES.",

The decor matches the theme perfectly and coming right before Christmas didn't disappoint. Decorations and Christmas cheer is everywhere. I ordered the Creme Brulee coffee and it came hot with a thin crisp on top of flamed sugar. The chocolate croissant will make you swear off any other croissants for the rest of your life. Flaky but not dry and the chocolate is just enough but doesn't overwhelm the butter which is key to a good croissant. Also ordered the Nord sandwich with was also very good. Will definitely be coming back and bringing friends.",

Not just Croissants the assorts of Croissants least over four different ones. Too many for me try one time. I order the chocolate, almond, nuttella, and regular one with the special of the day sandwich \"Croque Bosali\". I did get piece of the almond one before hooked my boys at bike store with the assortment. It was good. Croissants the whole key for me. BUTTERY and FLAKY. If you fingers get butter moist each time grab it. Beautiful thing in life. The Croissants one of the things place is known for can understand the appeal. Winnah.  The sandwich was solid. The ham and cheese (forget the cheese but not your plain cheese put it that way) was prefect combination. The Croissant for the bread is divine. The little side salad ok nothing special just basic organic mix greens with some kind house balsamic vinaigrette and couple slices of fresh oranges on the side. Eye appeal this dish is far from. Really at the end of the day about the food presentation could careless.   I really like the whole interior look definitely going for some of that Paris vibe from the artwork on the walls, the way they display all the Croissants in wicker baskets, signs each different pasty even the menu in chalkboard style, and the smell is great from the minute walk in. The prices reasonable I think for the pastries. Not that I go often to bakeries in general. Definitely great spot get some coffee, great book, and great fresh pastries. They also have little outside patio area that can chill at with friends. Service was awesome. It was my first time the lady was  helpful and gave great recommendations.  Since close by no doubt plan on coming back trying more of the fresh baked goodies.",

Dimmed lights, blinds turned up, and the sweet, sad notes of \"Careless Whisper\" blaring from my speakers on repeat start sounding like \"Carbless Whisper\" around the 25th time as I attempt to kill myself with a plastic knife.  Fortunately, Rosallie offers the carbs worthy of getting me out of any kind of funk.  The plain croissant is so simple, yet so awesome.  I cherish the slightly crispy and crunchy ends while the middle of it is borderline pornobutterography in my mouth.  In fact, I've created a special two course tasting menu only known to me.  I call it  \"Les Deux\":  1. Butter Croissant 2. Almond Croissant  With baked goods like these, who needs Le Prozac?",

However the young lady who brought them didn't know which was soy and which wasn't. She had to go back and ask. Very unnerving for the lactose intolerant. My other friend ordered the quiche. Nice presentation but the top looked burnt. It was cut into 2 slices, and looked microwaved. She ate half and took the rest home. I have another French cafe I really love and their quiche is to die for. So it's hard to feel objective. The pastries were plentiful and truly beautiful. I'd go back again just to try a second experience. Note: the ladies room needs a hook or shelf because there is no where to set one things.",

Quest: Duck Confit- 2 stars   I thought this sandwich would be mind-blowing, but the duck was overcooked and tough, hence ruining my experience.  Croissant- 2 stars  I have high expectations for croissants at a French bakery. It was alright.   The salad that comes with the sandwiches are generous.

Their croissants are crunchy outside and soft inside; you can choose from a selection of plain, chocolate or almond. The raisin roll was good; a little too sweet for my taste. Good coffee by our American standards, could be better by French standards (you know what I'm referring to if you had coffee in any European country). The tea selection on the other hand is pretty good: a variety of loose leaf teas nicely displayed for customers to smell before choosing.",

I work a 9am-5am job, and I would LOVE to hang out here after work and have a cup of their magnificent Creme Brule! It's always my go to drink. Delicious and savory. That with a piece of their Madeleine. So yummy!   I've also tried both of their quiche, and you wont be disappointed! It looks a little bit burnt on top, but there's no burnt taste or anything. Promise! I get them a lot. Also, try out their sandwiches!   My two favorites:   Quest, which is duck with their home made onion jam and butter. Scrumptious! So much flavor and so their breads are always soft! FRIKKIN YUM, MAN!   Nord, the smoked salmon sandwich goodness! Very delectable and you can never go wrong when it comes to salmon! Their home made jam must be it too! I about cried when I took a bite of this.   With those sandwiches, they do drown it with a generous amount of salad. All that color in one plates make it look so beautiful!   I have also had their desserts. Macaroons, Opera, tiramisu, and parfait. All were amazing. I know I sound vague, but I'm usually not a fan or all of those and  I gobbled it all up when I did have them.  Give this place a chance! I'm a happy camper every time!",

I could go into the freshness of everything but no need to go there what else would you expect from a classy, busy bistro? I'm just glad they are 10 miles away from me. I could easily spend to much time here.",

One recommendation is to have mustard (Dijon or stone ground) available for the sandwiches and meat platters.",

Today, we went in for tea & pastries. Their Tea is special. They serve it in a special teapot for loose tea. Keeping the leaves away from your tea. And, it is the tea stayed hot for about an hour that we were there.  They have an outdoor patio with about three tables, each table has about three chairs. But, inside, the place itself is very cute & cozy. I usually stay inside. I like the part all the way in the back, or southside if you well. It has cozy lounge chairs. Today, I noticed they had a sofa. I believe that it's new.   They also had a sign that they just started serving wine. Maybe, next time, we will try that. I have tried their food. I really love the quiche. I'm sure they that have many other dishes that are delicious. This is definitely a very special place that you should try... in case you haven't.",

They serve wine all day so no need to feel obligated to drink coffee at brunch, wine is perfectly acceptable.  Petit de jeuner francais: BREAD BREAD BREAD. Well actually, 2 breads. The chocolate croissant is dense, not your usually fluffy barely there bread. The toasted french bread was almost a sourdough to me. The homemade jams were an A plus plus. Order this and one other plate to share! Centre: Was the sandwich they recommended us. It was large enough to be split by 2 people and was a little more lunch, than breakfast food. The chipotle spread was nothing spicy, the cheese was light.  Lots of fun restaurants in this plaza, but Rosallie is my new favorite in not just the plaza, but all of Rainbow!",

They also have bottomless mimosas apparently everyday which is an awesome addition to any French bistro. No outdoor seating area but plenty of comfort and space indoors.   I came early one morning to fuel up and was immediately greeted and served by friendly staff working diligently to sculpt fresh bread and cook up tasty pastries. I ordered a croissant and coffee but really wish I paleo ordered a sandwich to go as they looked fantastic. Not to mention the free samples of almond croissants at the counter which I would never say no to.  Prices are typical for quality but still won't set you over $10 to get full and fulfilled. Rosalie's is a top notch French bakery. A must if you're craving freshness and you're in the area.",

Today, I ordered the (also) famous, Ham & Cheese Croissant which came with a side salad and oranges. To pair, I ordered a Cappuccino. So fulfilled, the way to my heart is definitely through my tummy and Rosallie does that for me! Food, 5 stars!  And as others have mentioned already, the environment and atmosphere of this cafe is perfect for getting work done, studying solo or getting together with friends for lunch. It's not too loud as I have my headphones on with music playing, I highly recommend this spot to come by yourself or with others.",

    "text": "Many visits later, Rosallie is one of my favorite places in town!  My favorite eats: + Nord Sandwich with smoked salmon, red onion, tomato, cucumber, capers, mixed greens, and housemade shallot spread on toasted Petite Tourte. + Tartine L'Americaine with hardwood smoked honey-cured bacon, cheese, and egg yolk; served with marinated cherry tomatoes. + Tartine L'espagnole with housemade tomato sauce, rotisserie chipotle chicken, red onion, and mozzarella. + Tartine La Reine with dried paris ham, mushroom, and cheese. + Quiche Veggie with roasted zucchini, sauteed mushroom, and sauteed onion; served with side salad. + Croque Rosallie: Paris ham, sweet onion bechamel, and mozzarella on croissant.  Basically all the Tartines are phenomenal; I love the flaky pastry crust and the combinations are amazing. The quiches are equally delicious and I've enjoyed all of them as well. I've just begun to venture into the sandwich offerings, but I was blown away by the Nord! The housemade shallot spread is insanely flavorful and works so well with the salmon and fresh vegetables. I love ordering a couple entrees along with a couple pastries to share with a friend or even to enjoy on my own and taking the rest home.  Favorite beverages: + Latte Provence (lavender and honey) + Creme Brulee Latte + White Chocolate Coconut Latte + Kir Royale  All of the special latte flavors are tasty and fun. I've really taken to the Latte Provence with its perfect balance of sweet and just a tad floral. With their new wine offerings, I've had the chance to try the Kir Royale and it is wonderful!  Favorite pastries: + Palmier + Almond Croissant + Croissant + Fruit Tart + Macarons  The desserts are fantastic, but I'm really a fan of the breads and pastries offered. The palmiers are fantastically crispy and buttery. Also, you can't go wrong with their croissants. The macarons are great, too and I had the absolute pleasure of their delicious Pistachio and Vanilla Macarons as party favors for my last birthday.  The location is convenient, easy to access, and the space is lovely. I love bringing friends or just enjoying a treat by myself. Jonathan is brilliant and very kind; it is a great joy to have him and the Rosallie family in our community!",

    "text": "Easily the best croissant I've ever had in Vegas, and I've been to every single French bakery in the valley. Their coffee is really good, smooth, and strong.   I wish they had a bigger selection of pastries though. They have 2-3 tarts which didn't look too appealing and a handful of other things. I need more goodies to choose from!   The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 starts which they completely deserve is because twice I've been overcharged for my order. Today I finally realized it was around $9.4 for my drink and croissant which didn't add up to the prices on the board--but it was the same amount I was charged the week prior. They reversed the charge and after calculating with tax, I still don't think I was charged correctly. I'm going to come back when I'm in the area, but will make sure to pull out my calculator when checking out.",

The reason why I'm giving 3 stars, it's because they do not sell baguettes, it's s little pricey and the big negative point is that the black girl who works there since the beginning never acknowledge us, never say hello, goodbye, never smile, it's almost as she doesn't wanna be there. She's not French and I feel like she doesn't represent this establishment very well. Maybe the owner should consider hiring someone nicer.",

Eric had the chevre quiche which had potential but was not warned up enough and he was wishing there was some hot sauce to give it that kick he likes.  We each ordered coffee,  his a double espresso which he enjoyed and I loved my hazelnut latte.   We also shared a piece of walnut tart which was okay but I think that if it had been warm would be delicious,  another thing I'll ask for next time.

But this bakery is a must try- way better and more affordable than say Panera or Bouchon. The croissant was huge and soft. Very cute interior and the tall cashier was really friendly. I think they could benefit from expanding their menu to have more items and heartier dishes than sandwiches. Cant wait to come back to try more!!",

    "text": "I'll start by saying the food a Rosallie is wonderful, I've been there a few times and have recommended it to many friends based on the quality of their food.  They are usually a bit slow but last time was too much.  I live far from Rosallie, and it is because of the love of food I drive that far.   I'm not one usually to complain about service but their service last time was inexcusable.  We ordered a coffee and a tea, the coffee arrived after 45 minute wait!  A coffee?  The tea never even came, even after asking about it twice after 30 minutes wait and being completely ignored by the girl working at the counter.  I noticed how she served the drinks of a table that arrived way past after us too. The food only partially arrived after 50 minute wait.  Even understanding that it was a Sunday at 11 am, they had only one guy working on the kitchen who was clearly overwhelmed and a girl taking the orders and serving.  The girl excused herself saying she was new, but that only shows a failure of management for not properly training their employees, why did she keep taking orders if she could not serve the customers she was taking orders from?  After having waited almost one hour, we had one food order to go and I cancelled the other food order, (it was the cheese plate which it would not have been ok to take out in the heat), the server assured me she would credit me for it--she never did, I was charged for food and drink I was never served.  This just left a very bad taste in my mouth and rather hungry, I'm never going back.",

I could tell that the execution was way off and just wanted to help him out. What a douche. Rosallie may stay in business or do alright since it's on Rainbow, but anyone who cares about food in general, much less French cafe items, would do better to move along to another spot--there are way too many good restaurants and beautiful cafes to waste your time here.",

But I made off with the French bread they didn't eat. I bought an almond raisin croissant, thinking of having it tomorrow, but I got a bit peckish around 3:00 and thought I would have a bite or two.

I went early on a Saturday morning when the traffic was light and the restaurant was empty--perfect. I had an Almond Croissant and it was wonderful--flaky and light and a little sweet and I could have eaten four of them. The coffee was a little strong for my taste, but it was nice to be able to have available some chocolate and cinnamon to sprinkle into it and with some cream it was almost like a mocha latte. I also tried a bite of the walnut pie and it was as good as many of the reviews say it is.",

They have a variety of coffee and espresso drinks that I have yet to try, mainly because I'm a sucker for their loose leaf tea. They serve it in a French press. The prices are reasonable. It is a counter-service place, so it is casual. It is also usually pretty quiet and it doesn't have the crowded feeling of the typical coffee house (yes, I mean you, Starbucks).",

But the drinks... Let me tell you how awful these drinks were. The black coffee was watered down, completely undrinkable, the creme brulee tasted like they burnt the espresso and the hot chocolate tasted like a cheap Hershey's chocolate bar melted in milk. Now the presentation of the hot chocolate was cool, they steam the milk and give you a cube of chocolate on a stick that you melt yourself in the hot milk, but this is definitely not worth $4.50 for THE SMALLEST CUP IN THE UNIVERSE! Disappointed with our drinks I thought we could tell the manger and see what they can do for us because I didn't want my money to go to waste. The register lady was very nice and said she appreciated the feedback and went and got the manger, or the owner, and so we told him what was going on and he just kind of stared at us like \"what do you want me to do for you\" type of way, we asked if we could get our money back and said \"no.\" That's it's, just no. No apology or anything, didn't offer to give us anything else, didn't bother bother with good customer service at all! Horrible place! Definitely do not recommend going there!",

We vacation often to Vegas from Australia and know the local place quite well, so when we saw a new spot we got quite excited to try. The owner was such a gentleman, the barista shy but efficient, the food and coffee were absolutely delicious. We both had cappuccinos and the petit dejeuner breakfast plate and it was so good! He makes his own jam and the coffee was so fresh! So many places don't know how to make a simple cappuccino so we were definitely happy with the experience. We are here for a few days more and we will be back Rosallie. Just a sidenote for yelp itself, we were reading these reviews from the 'yelpers' and we were shaking our head in unison, we understand the business of yelp and such a shame how the business works towards the owners. Yelping should not be a profession, it should be where customers are able to write our thoughts for the sake of our experience. In a sense yelp is using coercion methods.",
