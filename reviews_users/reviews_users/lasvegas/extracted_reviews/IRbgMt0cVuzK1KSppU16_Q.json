It had some herb in it which was just so strangely magical in the roll. Wow! Everyone else enjoyed the special cucumber roll more. But  I'm just little wary of rolls without seaweed wrap..  Had the seared sea scallops with garlic noodles. Lots and lots of noodles but no scallops to be found.   Thank god this meal was free, I wouldn't normally dine here. Pretty restaurant and nice staff though!",

I wasn't originally enthused about it because I'm eh on the whole Asian fusion concept, but I was told by the Wynn concierge it was a good place for solo diners. This is definitely True. My whole meal was recommended by Jeremy the bartender and he did not steer me wrong. I had the shrimp tempura, avocado and mango roll and the \"velvet Elvis\" desert which wasn't even on the menu, plus a bunch of delicious drinks. So much fun.",

Seriously wanted to try everything. Had their rock shrimp tempura and their spicy tuna roll along with this really good fruity cocktail.  Nice and sweet just how I like it.  Service was on point. We made reservations and were immediately seated to this beautiful booth. Our waiter was very nice and made great suggestions. Will definitely be back again..",

    "text": "Food was great but service was awful. We ended up coming for restaurant week and ended up waiting for our food for the whole time. We ordered hamachi appetizer, two steak entrees, and two salmon entrees. The wait between the appetizer and entrees was bearable since we ordered sides. I will admit we do eat quite fast but we waited more than 20 minutes between our appetizers and the entrees which made no sense because the restaurant had just opened the hour before and only four tables were seated.The restaurant was not full but we waited patiently. After our entrees were finished we waited past 40 minutes for our ice cream dessert. I didn't understand why he did not check in with us or why there was such a long wait for then to scoop ice cream into tiny cones. As soon as they gave us te ice cream I asked for the check. Whilst looking at the check the manager decided to check in on us and ask if there was anything he could do since we waited for so long. Why did you ask if my bill was already paid? What should I do at this point? Seriously guys? I hope a manager ends up contacting us back. I don't think this is acceptable even if I am a patron dining off of the restaurant week menu. Why did you decide to participate if you weren't going to treat all your paying customers alike? There were more than enough servers to accommodate us but there wasn't enough staff to cover the kitchen? Please help me understand. I spent $360 for dinner for four and I did not get the same service. What didn't make sense to me was that despite everyone seeing us wait for a long period of time no one checked in on us and I don't think this is acceptable.   What a disappointment. Will not be returning.",

Though we had a 10:00 reservation, it was another 45 minutes before we were seated, so we grabbed a drink at the bar outside.    Feels a little like dining in a dance club, but the food was excellent.  I ordered from the vegan/vegetarian menu.  I loved the gardein lettuce wraps - so good, I could eat that every day!  I also had their most popular vegetarian roll.  I forget the name, but it had crunchy veggies with a spicy vegan sauce.  Boyfriend liked his sashimi and spicy scallops which had a solid kick.  They had good wine selections, and a very friendly sommelier.  We were assigned two servers, which seemed to help speed things along on a very busy night.  You will most likely dine alongside a rather interesting clientele - interesting to me, at least, coming from Seattle where your dining out attire consists of Chacos and a North Face jacket.  But even if you aren't a fan of sceney type places, I'd say the food here is worth a trip.  And it's probably a little less clubby feeling if you dine earlier in the night.",

The restaurant decor was so elegant,and beautiful especially the seats I got with my bf, it was at the side with two seats and it made me feel like a little love corner for us. Their waiters and waitresses were so friendly and helpful. I incidentally booked the wrong date but then they still managed to let us sit in. Their rolls were so good, especially The shrimp and The Tuna roll, also the Rainbow roll was very delicious. The waiter who served us gave us a lot of excellent recommendations on the menu. We listened to him and tried all of them and that they were all on point! Lastly, the dessert Flaming Fiji Apple, it was the bomb!!!!!! SO GOOD like you want more and more!!!! Everyone should order this for dessert, I swear you won't regret it. I wish I could go back to Vegas now and try this again! For the price, I know it's a bit high but its worth it , trust me. I guarantee you will go back there again when you visit Vegas.",

We loved the garlic garnish on all of the sushi/sashimi apps. Steamed seabass is also one of our favorites. Porterhouse steak was cooked perfectly to our request, medium rare, super juicy!

The server came over and begin her Intro. We told her that we were sat at a dirty table and we rather change tables since no one came by to clean it.   They finally moved us tables and everyone was apologetic.  We sit and we order a bottle of the duck horn. It was so good.   My BF wasn't hungry so I ordered for myself.  I ordered the hamachi with the crispy garlic. Wow wow wow!!!!! Order this!  I then ordered the side of corn with the sriracha. Amazing. It's so good.  I then ordered the tuna over crispy rice. I thought this was more of a bowl but it was presented as a sushi.   It was absolutely incredible.   The total was around $220.

We ordered about $300 worth of food and drinks. Our first server was either drunk or high or possibly both. He was so out of it, he couldn't get one thing right. After a few dishes I think he realized how much we hated his service. So then he turns us over to a waiter who probably wasn't a waiter maybe a clean up guy. Either way he was even worse to deal with.   He argued with my girlfriend about the drink she ordered. Seriously!? I wouldn't even expect this at a dive bar!   One of the dishes we ordered was the more expensive Wagyu Filet they have on their menu. After being passed between 2 idiot waiters, they took forever to bring the dish out. When the filet comes out its not even the one we ordered. They tried to give us an overlooked filet of their regular one.   We weren't offered anything for this experience or mess up between 2 absolute retards.   Attn: GM, please do not hire kids to serve at your restaurant where it's an average of $200 a person.",

We had Miso soup (you can taste the difference between cheap tofu and the high quality fresh tofu they use.) Tuna + Crispy Rice is a great pairing of the cold a delicate Tuna with the warm crispy rice, the size and proportions of a regular Tuna sushi piece but comes 6 to an order. Shrimp Tempura & Spicy Tuna Roll quickly became one of my favorite sushi rolls. Most are either too pedestrian, too big and wild or are an amalgamation of several seemingly random items that more often than not, just don't work.  This roll nails it!",

We were served \"family style\" dishes of really high end sashimi, steak, sushi rolls, and some random fried Chinese style dish that felt like it didn't fit.  Coming here was a friendly reminder of how lucky I am to have great sushi for a reasonable price where I live. Nothing that came out was something I couldn't get at a place near my home at a quarter of the price.  I'd totally recommend coming here, just be prepared to have you wallet emptied out.",

The ambience was very classy, but the blinds were not pulled up to see the nice view of the pool and the outside until we had already finished our meal which was a bit odd to me. None the less the experience was great and the service of the staff was very nice and friendly. My husband and I did look on yelp to try to find something good and within our budget to try so we chose the wagyu sliders (these were highly recommended by many other yelpers) crab fried rice, and shrimp pad Thai. Everything we had was great and very delicious. We even had room for dessert which we chose the chocolate orange sphere, the sphere didn't melt correctly like the other side of the tables sphere did so I was a little disappointed when I was recording but it was delicious. Overall, our party was a pretty big party and everyone enjoyed their food and desserts. I really loved how there was a a nice view outside but would've enjoyed it more if we were able to see if during our meal.",

The service from the moment you're greeted to how they seat you and begin to take your order. It's truly a wonderful and one of a kind experience. As far as drinks, for the ladies try out the Dream.... men, I'm an old fashioned type of guy, so up to you. As far as good, you seriously can't go wrong with anything! No joke! We've had almost all the steaks and all the sides. All amazing. My personal favs to start would be the hamachi sashimi, the rock shrimp tempura, and the tuna and crispy rice. As far as steaks, I'm a wagyu guy. Both the wagyu's they offer are A5 from Japan. Both phenomenal! With the sides, I like the XO shrimp fried rice, adobo crab fried rice and the charred asparagus. Enjoy!",

Yep the burger was very expensive as I paid $27 (cost + tax) for 3 small sliders and no sides.  Truly the sliders were purely delicious.  The texture, taste and look was spot on beef. I very much enjoyed this meal.  Having said all that, would I go back?  Perhaps not as it's just too expensive for the value.  You get what you pay for but I can't justify paying this price for such a small amount of food.  So I say if you're vegan, try it  once as you will like it and then be the judge as to whether or not this price point works for you.",

    "text": "We dined at Andrea's before heading over to the Jennifer Lopez concert at Planet Hollywood.. We were celebrating my 21st birthday.. We were slightly late for our reservation, but I had called ahead to make sure they would hold our table... They did so graciously and we believed the evening was off to a good start.. After sitting down and ordering drinks and reviewing the menu we order 2 appetizers and 4 entree's... Once we ordered we never saw another waitress again... We waited a while for the appetizers, but to our surprise our entree's came out with no appetizers... We waited again and finally flagged down a waitress to ask where they were.. She told us she would go check and that she was sorry... (We were at this point in a rush to leave because we had the concert after..) So, our original waitress comes to our table and apologizes and then very bluntly gives us two options 1. \"We can have the chef out the order out quickly.\" 2. \"We can cancel it for you.\" We were obviously shocked by the lack of apology and also by the choice we were given considering this was considered to be a \"fine dining\" restaurant.. (Even at BJ's Brewery if they forget an ordered dish they rush it out without question and comp that particular dish.. And BJ's Brewery is hardly fine dining.)  Out of all the fine dining restaurants we have ever been to the service here was by far the worst we've ever experienced.. I would honestly go as far as saying the service here was worse than the service I have received at places like Red Robin.  All in all - we were extremely disappointed by the service at this restaurant and we certainly do not plan on going back. A very large part of the reason you go to an upscale restaurant is the service, or when you dine out anywhere to be honest. Especially at places like this you're paying a premium for the service, and I can assure you the service here was not indicative of the title \"fine dining\" and certainly not to the standards that you would expect from The Wynn or Encore.",

We happened to sit next to the Wynns, while they were having their NYE dinner. We ordered miso black cod, tuna sashimi, and I can't remember... but we had a good combination of vege and meat options. We had fantastic cocktails, and they were almost better than the entrees themselves! Great service, great atmosphere, and great memories. Would go back again for sure. Highly recommended!",

I must recommend the beef sliders - the best I've ever had. This is a great place to take your friends before a night out at the club or at the tables. However, I was made aware shortly after arriving that they do not serve the blooming onion here. Sometimes life just happens that way - but with that warning in mind, I definitely recommend this restaurant!",

When I say super white I mean their booths and chairs, etc.   Anyway, I got the kimchi, edamame, tofu fried rice. When it asked the waiter if it was big or small he told me it was small and would need a side dish to fill you up, so I got a salmon roll that was only 6 rolls. I got my dinner and the kimchi, edamame, tofu fried rice, it was the perfect spice for me, everything was mixed in together and cooked just right and the salmon roll was small... But still legit! I wish it was bigger. So after I got my rice the waiter, as always Vegas has to scam you, told me to get a side cause the bowl was small. Oh it was small but the bowl was deep! So it got me hella full afterwards especially with the sushi. My friend got a side of asparagus and it was sooooo small. They gave her a lot but still, it was still delicious!    This place is expensive but the food is worth what you're paying for. I would come back. Although, the chefs took forever to cook our food and there was only like 5 tables occupied. It took them about an hour and a half to bring out our food and we were starving. Minus 1 star.",

The atmosphere is hip and upscale, meaning if you're \"with the times\" then you wanna be here. There was one problem we had. Our reservation was at 10, but for some reason it was changed to 6. We told them the situation and they got us a table within 10 minutes which was great.  Now the food: Bacon fried rice - Good, not great. Skippable Tuna and crispy rice - So good. The crunch was perfect with the tuna. Wagyu beef sliders - The best thing all night. Get 10 of these. Crispy brussell sprouts - Surprisingly tasty. Great addition as a side. Shrimp tempura spicy tuna - Meh. Nothing special. Pork belly - One of the best pork belly dishes I've had. Big portion as well. Sliced prime New York strip - Beautifully cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Andrea's has just sealed its place in my heart as a staple for ever Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Ate here on a Thursday night last week. My friends & I were at the Wynn pool and were approached by a promoter (very friendly young woman - I think her name was Erica) who was recruiting guests for a special promotion for the restaurant and the nightclub next to Andrea's (Surrender). It involved Andrea's 7-7-7 deal (special menu of a cocktail, appetizer, and entree, all for $7 each) as well as a free drink ticket for a glass of champagne and a pass to Surrender that included an open bar (vodka & tequila). We skipped the Surrender part of the deal because as it was our last night in Vegas & none of us wanted to be hungover the next day (I have officially entered the 1-2 day long hangover age - I can't recover from hangovers as quickly as I used to! Gah!).  We thought the 7-7-7 deal was too good to be True, especially for a swanky place like Andrea's. And we figured out the catch: (1) We arrived at our appointed time, but were met with some confusion over where to place us or where we could wait (2-3 different people told us different things). But that's ok, it got cleared up within 10 minutes. Totally forgiveable. (2) The appetizer and entree portions were not too big. The menu also included an optional list of entrees that can be added on for an incremental cost. A-HA!! We knew it was too good to be True! But seriously, overall it was not a huge problem at all, it was still a decent deal in general, so we bit - and did enjoy most of the food we got.  Going back to the portion size not being too big: I expected that since this is a very trendy & upscale restaurant at the Encore. Also, since I was wearing a tight dress, maybe it was better that we ate small - any more and I would've had to stop breathing!  I had: - Espresso Martini (it was good but a little too much espresso-taste) - Shrimp & Pork Shumai (these were not very good actually - kind of fatty and squishy) - Spicy Tuna Roll (pretty good) - 1 of my friends & I shared the Wok-Fried Chicken (YUM!!) and the Lobster Fried Rice (Also YUM!!)  Ambience was swanky and chic, lighting was on the dark/dim side. Noise level was average for a Vegas restaurant: Not too loud, but not super quiet either. We shouted over each other once or twice, but not the whole night.  Our server and the hostesses were very nice and friendly, very accommodating. Our server was also very helpful and always around when we needed her, and she also popped by to check on us periodically without overdoing it. I hope she liked her tip because we left her a decent one!  Very nice place, I would like to check out the full menu next time as most of the food was delicious.",

    "text": "PSA: This is in ENCORE not Wynn  This was some of the best service I have had in a long time. And let me preface by saying my 2 girlfriends and I were already late to our reservation (which I hate doing) and they didnt mind at all. Sat us at a gorgeous table, even took out photo like 4 times (we were also celebrating my friend Lauren's birthday.) we had a server, Kip, who was just an angel to us the whole time! took care of us really well and gave us good recommendations and was prompt to notice if we needed anything else.   We started with the Seafood on Ice and got the larger portion which had 4 GIANT grab leg, 4 jumbo shrimp, 6 (i think) oysters, scallop salad, lobster salad, and tuna poke. This was a pretty expensive app at $98 but I would say its well worth it. Not a single piece was bad. The crab legs were soooooo buttery and succulent. and the scallops were perfect and not fishy smelling. Those and the lobster salad were my favorite. I ended up having the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll and it was seriously amazing, the inside was super soft with the fish and avocado but the crunchy part was VERY crunchy so you had a multitude of textures the whole time you were eating.  This restaurant is definitely on the pricier side but the layout is so beautiful and the food was such good quality and everything was extremely fresh. They didnt rush us out when it was past close and I loved that you could see the encore pool club right outside. It made you feel amped and ready for the night rather than tired like i usually am after a big meal.  At the end we were way too full for dessert but they brought out cake pops as a \"Happy Birthday\" which was so sweet.  I would absolutely come back here and i would love to have Kip as our server again!",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate my friends birthday. Her husband called in advance to reserve a table and inform them it was her birthday... apparently the table was not ready when they arrived and they had to wait an additional 30 minutes...  My friend mentioned to me when they waited at the bar the bartender didn't even acknowledge them. He was to busy flirting with some girls.      Anyways, then they got seated and we arrived just in time.. our waiter was Daniel. He was so friendly and recommended the best dishes and drinks to order. Since I'm a big salmon lover but wanted to try something else he brought four mini samplers of it for us to try. I was impressed by that and it was good. The drinks came out and the food came out like like 45min later...     The main reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because we all enjoyed the dishes. However the customer service is horrible. Daniel starting off good, then peace out where is he? Looks like he was done for the night. I counted 11 waiters and not once did they come if we needed another drink or if it was time to clear plates etc. They were all too busy chatting to each other. It took awhile for even receiving the check. The worst part is my friend never got sang happy bday or a little dessert. That was the main reason!      Her husband eventually went to look for someone to share the experience. I guess the guy (manager) simply said sorry to hear that and walked away. Later he found us at the bar outside. He asked us if we had plans or would like another drink... We told him we were already on the guest list to Intrigue and that's where we planned on going next. He made sure we didn't have to make line and me and my friend would get a complimentary drink. I guess that was nice in his part for that but it still won't change the service you will receive when you come to eat here.      What's funny is before we went we asked a couple of locals who lived in the area if they recommended this restaurant and not all but some did say \"That place has awesome food but the service is horrible.\" Should of listened!!!",

    "text": "Finding fancy vegan friendly dining can be pretty hard but thankfully my bf found Andrea's to take me out for a nice birthday dinner!   We made reservations a few weeks in advance which was a good idea since it was Friday of Labor Day weekend, so it was super packed! We were seated immediately and couldn't stop talking about the ambiance of the place - very classy with a nice view of the Encore Beach Club right outside the window and the dim lighting was a perfect touch.   The separate vegan menu has a ton of choices so we had a hard time deciding but ended up getting the gyoza and sushi roll for appetizers and for entrees we got the side of fried rice, the tofu bowl with impossible burger meat (the famous burger that \"bleeds like real meat\"), and the pan fried noodles. All were super delicious (my favorites were the sushi roll and the fried rice!) but the tofu bowl was kinda salty. The portions are huge and very shareable! We ended the night with the vegan tart dessert and they were nice enough to even decorate it with a candle and a happy birthday sign.   Service was amazing; our tables were cleaned right away to prepare for the next dish, waters were refilled automatically, and they even provided us a avocado palette cleanser before our meals.   For locals, don't forget to check in for 30% off your cocktails!   Definitely a great first time experience & would love to be back again someday to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "When the phrase \"meal of my dreams\" gets thrown out, it's generally a figure of speech. That being said, I've dreamt about the dinner my girlfriend and I had at Andrea's twice in the past week - and it's been exactly one week since our meal there.   The attention-to-detail here is superb, and you very well might find yourself where we were, in that we spent basically the entire meal trying not to let our jaws hit the floor after having our expectations blown out of the water time & again. Your every need is tended to at Andrea's, and nothing goes overlooked. It's worth every last penny:   ____________  + I found the vibe here to be somewhat different from what I had read about in researching Andrea's prior to our visit. On one hand, the \"sexy atmosphere\" was all accounted for - dimly lit, beautifully sculpted light fixtures, and the signature shifting eyes at the bar all made for an edgy, inviting, and seductive dinner experience. My girlfriend pointed out how the whole environment feels \"geared towards women,\" but I'd argue instead that it's instead geared towards \"getting laid.\"   From our table's location, we could look out to the left and see Encore Beach Club at Night going off, LEDs and all. And yet - even with its proximity to EBC/Surrender, Andrea's remains perfectly insulated from even the slightest hint of thumping music & bass. Needless to say, the whole setup was both ambitious and spectacular.   ____________  + Andrea's boasts what I believe is the best server-to-table ratio that I've ever seen. What this leads to is a supremely attentive, alert wait staff. Case in point:   The GF steps away from the table momentarily to head to the restroom. In the few minutes that she's away, three servers simultaneously approach our table; one refills both our waters, another folds her napkin and places it neatly at her seat, and the third ADJUSTS HER MENUS and gently positions them right within her reach...I had to stop myself from squealing like a little girl.   + I almost felt bad as one server after the next would make way for me on the two occasions that I visited the restroom; even at my insistence that they move first, the staff members refused to budge. The VIP treatment was in full effect!  + Okay, okay, one more - when ordering up drinks via the iPad menu, you're given the option to send an email reminder to yourself if a particular variety/label catches your eye. Again, Andrea's impressed me not only because of the restaurant's overall ability to produce consistent excellence - but also because our meal fulfilled needs/wants that we didn't even know that we had. That's True luxury!  ____________  + Being that we had plans to visit XS after wrapping up our meal, we decided to dine with a focus on flavor as opposed to fullness. Our server (I wish I could remember his name, he did a stellar job) recommended that we start off with the Hamachi Sashimi, and we tacked on a Rainbow Roll to boot. I appreciated how Andrea's brought out a gluten-free menu to our table in recognition of the GF's allergies. Normally, I'm more keen on trying more adventurous types of sushi selections, but we were in a bit of a rush - being that we arrived for dinner close to 11 PM.   + The Hamachi Sashimi was (I'm running out of superlatives here) fantastic; this is the dish that I've dreamt about twice in the past 7 days (except, sadly, I recall the Hamachi being $15 in my dream, as opposed to its real-life $23 price tag). The clarity of flavor and freshness of the fish made for some very long, methodical chewing; the crispy garlic and pickled cherry peppers truly brought out every characteristic of the hamachi's flavor without masking the fish's natural taste.    We made the mistake of ordering a side of ponzu to dip the fish in; I'd advise against doing so, as that WILL overpower the natural hamachi flavor. Sometimes it's better to leave things untouched...  + The Rainbow Roll that we ordered up was also delicious. Not at all creamy or mushy like a cheap textbook sushi roll, this dish practically elevated my thinking of what a sushi roll could be. Every variety of fish placed atop the roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) shined with natural flavor.  ____________  Dinner at Andrea's makes you feel like a million bucks. It's got all the special touches that embody a real fine dining experience, complementing this refinement with lots of sexiness and character. Hats off to Steve Wynn, Chef Elevado, etc. - they knocked it out of the park and over the moon with this one.  PRO TIP:  Staying at a conventional Wynn/Encore room doesn't offer any advantage in terms of your ability to secure ideal dinner reservation times (can't say the same about the Tower Suites, as we haven't tried those yet!). We tried to book a table during the second day of our stay, and the only available seatings were at 6:00PM and 10:30PM. That being said, save yourself some hassle, and try to snag your reservations well in advance!",

This is the place to celebrate birthdays, the last \"single\" dinner (bachelor/bachelorette), pre-game, or just a simple & nice dinner.  I brought my friends from NY and FL here and they were impressed by the high-energy vibe. The staff was beyond attentive and even down to the sommelier commenting on the Woodford reserve drop-off. There's a touch of detail most restaurants tend to forget about.  We started off with the pork belly, spicy tuna crunch, salmon sashimi. The pork belly, with Filipino influence, was absolutely delicious. Something to remember. Spicy tuna crunch had the right amount of balance to not be over-powered by most popular rendition of relying on spicy mayo.  We continued on with the flash-fried brussel sprouts, sea bass, and a sushi roll (I forgot which one!). Whatever it was, we LOVED it. No complaints as we devoured it all.  To finish it off, we got three different ice creams which consisted of exotic flavors. My memory doesn't serve well on the exact flavors but boy, do I remember the experience.  I'd highly recommend this place as it is somewhere you will not leave disappointed.",

The menu is huge, the portions are very small, and the prices are a little higher than I like to pay. I still think it was worth it, because the food was soooo so good. There is a vegan menu with a ton of options! To start we had a crispy tofu sushi roll, veggie gyoza, and spicy peppers. I had the curry vegan chicken and veggies (it did not come with rice and I really wish it did). My manager had a pork belly... the portion was laughable and it did not come with anything else. It was delicious overall, just make sure you're prepared to order a lot of food!",

    "text": "To get the nitty gritty out of the way, I'll start by saying that the service at the bar was less than stellar. It took nearly 5 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone behind the bar after we sat down. It also didn't appear that our presence there was of any consequence. I would have enjoyed eating dinner at the bar if I had felt welcomed, but alas...I got my drink as I waited for my table and watched the bartenders talking to each other and not their guests.   We were whisked away by the host who took us to our table. You can transfer your bar tab directly to your table, but we opted to pay out the bartender directly so they received the full tip. Even when service isn't top notch, I always leave 20%, because the former server in me just won't quit. Tipping karma is real people!!  Out table side service was phenomenal. Our server, Christian I believe?, had a gentle elegance behind his service that was flawless. We sat in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and stairs. Great people watching views for me while my guest enjoyed watching the kitchen push out beautiful dishes.  The Asian Pear cocktail is to die for. Sweet but not overwhelming. For dinner, we shared the Bacon Fried Rice, Long Beans, Seared Foie Gras, Hamachi Sashimi, and the Waygu Beef Tartar. The highlights were really the Tartar, which had amazing mouth appeal and and incredible mix of textures, and the Hamachi. That crispy garlic on top was mind blowing. I also really enjoyed the decadent Foie Gras which melted in my mouth.",

Incredibly innovative menu options, with an Asian twist. I've tried the Impossible Burger several times in various restaurants, but I have to say that this was my favorite experience! Perhaps I'm biased because I have a more Asian palette, but everyone at the table really enjoyed the Lettuce Cups and Mapo Tofu.  Overall great meal - everything else we tried was equally delicious. We tried the hamachi sashimi, a variety of rolls, and the black cod. For dessert, we had cake pops and shaved ice. Even the midwesterners at our table whom have never had shaved ice, enjoyed it! Lastly, the wine recommendation the Som gave us was great! Surprisingly low priced and paired well with our selections.  Service was also noteworthy!  It's been 2 days since I dined there, and I've raved about my meal to at least a dozen different people! I'm sure I'll reach digger dozen before the end of the week.",

I was excited to finally try this place and was even more excited that I only had to cover the tip.   To start our meal we had the steamed edamame. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and we finished the entire bowl. After that was the house salad. I really enjoyed the dressing and crispy onion topping. Our next course was a plate of assorted sushi which contained a cucumber roll, tuna roll and salmon roll. My favorite was the tuna. I loved how fresh and flavorful the fish was. The cucumber roll was my least favorite, not very flavorful at all. Next was the beef and broccoli with a side of steamed rice. I loved the beef. The texture was spot on but, I felt the broccoli was just so so. To end things off we had cake pops for dessert. I chose the mint chocolate which was absolutely delicious.   I'm very glad I got to try this place out and would definitely be back again to try some more dishes.",

We started with the hamachi, spicy tuna crispy rice, edamame, book Choy and cucumber salad. Flavors we're great and they were easily able to make these dishes gluten free. Nice, healthy options before a night out on the town.  A friend and I shared the filet mignon for dinner and it was very good. A bit under medium rare and it was a quality piece of meat for $68.

The food exceeded all of my expectations, and the staff was 5 star all the way around! For dinner, I had the Spicy Jidori Fried Chicken, Saikyo Miso Black Cod, and some assorted sushi. For desert, my date and I shared something that was like a giant shave ice for two. Unfortunately, I don't remember the name, but it was pretty jaw dropping. It was very refreshing, and tasty. The bowl had an area where they put some dry ice, so the whole desert was in a fog the whole time. I will be back for sure!

It's a lounge feeling at a Asian restaurant with vegas style. The drink mixologist was great. Had an old fashioned and a glass of champagne.   The decor is beautiful and vegas chic.  Love the food. Had the steak tartar which was amazing. The cod was excellent. The Tom Kai soup was outstanding. The pad tie was wrapped in an egg wrap wonderful presentation. The servers manager whole staff paid attention to every detail. Enjoy the desert cheese cake wonton with the caramel sauces.  Enjoy a night in dinning opulence.",

    "text": "2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #6  Let me start this review by stating that we came here one evening for one thing and one thing only...to try their Mixed Berry Shave Ice.  5 Stars for excellent service and cool ambiance.  We didn't have any drinks or food at Andrea's so keep in mind that this review is only for their dessert and service.  Amanda M. recommended Andrea's for one of our challenges because their Mixed Berry Shave Ice had similar ingredients to Halo-Halo. That being said, we were also open to putting a little twist to our Halo-Halo madness.    There's two sides of this review. You got my thoughts on the Mixed Berry Shave Ice and you got Terri's.  For me, this dessert gets 5 stars for presentation alone.  What you have is a concoction of raspberries, strawberries, nata de coco, lychee's, white beans, condensed milk, lemon sorbet, and shave ice.  The only ingredients similar to Halo-Halo was the condensed milk, white beans, nata de coco, and lychee's.  Because I'm allergic to fruits, I had to dodge all the good stuff in order to taste this.  I thought it was pretty good. You initially taste the sweetness, followed by the texture, and lastly hit with the tang of the sorbet in it.  We were also treated with 3 cones of sorbet (Blood Orange Ginger, Sake Cherry, and Chocolate Chili), which was thoughtful and appreciative. Terri is one of the lucky souls out there that isn't allergic to fruits. She thought that the ambiance of this place, the presentation of the dessert, the amount of the servings, and the overall taste was pretty good as well. She also points out that compared to Halo-Halo, missing was the ube and flan.  I concur.  This dessert cost $21, which is about 4 times what Halo-Halo cost at most of the Flip joint out there.  But it's also big enough to serve two. Terri's thoughts...\"definitely an exorbitant indulgence that goes along with the price point for a place like Andrea's, but expensive for most\". Overall, this Halo-Halo hybrid was worth the try because we only live once. Halo-Halo Challenge #6 done!!!  PS:  I couldn't give this place any less than 4 stars because I didn't try their food.  The menu looked appealing and not everything on the menu was over the top.  I may come back just to try their sushi.    2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE: Contender #1 (Elena's):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74Qw\">yelp.com/biz/elenas-rest...</a> Contender #2 (Jollibee):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/jollibee-la...</a> Contender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQ\">yelp.com/biz/cafe-de-ceb...</a> Contender #4 (Salo-Salo):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-g...</a> Contender #5 (Thelma's):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXw\">yelp.com/biz/thelmas-fil...</a> Contender #6 (Andrea's):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDg\">yelp.com/biz/andreas-las...</a> Contender #7 (Chow King):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WA\">yelp.com/biz/chow-king-l...</a> Contender #8 (Fiesta Filipina):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/fiesta-filipina-cuisine-henderson#hrid:VLvYgY6ROsMh9q70tmkoHw\">yelp.com/biz/fiesta-fili...</a>",

If you have allergies to ANYTHING, they take it so seriously. Do not fret if you have nut or seafood allergies. Your food will NOT be contaminated.  The decor is ornate but not overly gaudy. One of the coolest designs and lighting I've ever seen in a restaurant. The pictures do not do it justice, it's not that bright in there.   There is a DJ playing some nights who spins music that is cooler than any resident DJ in Vegas. (Deep, Progressive, Future House & Funk). You definitely could get down in this place but you'll be setting the trend, not following it. Most people go here before the club.  Thank God, there are NO TVs. So people are focused on the food, the music, and the conversation. No one staring over you at the dinner table to watch some people throw a ball around.  The service is attentive but not invasive.  I usually order their house salad and the sushi. The sushi always comes out perfectly. It is always presented perfectly. The house salad has a wonderful dressing that I can't quite put my finger on, but I could eat it at every meal.  Oh, and there are frequently celebrities here if that's your kind of thing.",

The Portions are small, we went in a large group of 8, ended up paying $150 per Person, The Chef's Selection Sashimi was a joke, 6 thinly sliced almost transparent of very normal fish for $42, The Pork Belly Appetizer was a nothing to write about, flavorless, the Black Cod was good, but again a very small portion for $44, they forgot one of the main dishes from one of the group, did not even apologize, avoid the flaming merengue pie, unless you want to pay $50 for a flavorless dry cake. Even the espresso was bad, no crema just flat. Everyone from our group left like they just overpaid for a very simple non fulfilling meal. The Restaurant itself is nicely decorated, but with these prices I think they have to subsidize giving small portions of very normal food. Would not come back again ever.",

World renowned DJ Steve Angello (Swedish House Mafia) had put together a fantastic collection of old school rock mixed in with progressive house tunes. The mocktail was good - gingery & refreshing. Best to stick with the appetizers aka 'table shares,' which were truly delicious. The entrees (gulf shrimp, sea bass, salmon sushi, and crispy noodles) were a bit 'meh.' Cake pops were too sweet but fun to look at. The food took its time but at least the server had Channing Tatum's good looks.  Tip: if you get a table at Andrea's (Aan-dray-aaz), you can skip the line & entry charges for Surrender Nightclub.",

Being someone who works in customer service I can truly appreciate service like we had at Andreas!!! Daniel is amazing at what he does and has such a genuine demeanor!   On another note the food was outstanding. The sushi changed my life The rainbow roll, a classic, is out of this world. I don't think you can go wrong with any roll on the menu! The bacon Fried rice is also another must have!!  Needless too say we will be back very soon! And hope to have the same crew around when we are back! Thanks guys!!!",

However, Andrea's completely blew our minds and topped the list of the best dining experience we've ever had!  First, the service is impeccable. Your glass is never empty and our waiter was so attentive. He even seated us in a semi private part of the restaurant that felt like we were in our own space but still part of the dinner crowd. He was helpful with food recs when we didn't know what to order and remembered it was our anniversary and brought us cake pops and chopsticks with out names written on them!!!  Second, the chef surprised us with a complimentary tasting and it was insanely good. We  got the shrimp pad Thai, the ramen burgers, the miso cod and the coconut Thai soup and our absolute favorite was the ramen burgers. We still talk about them now. I would recommend everything we got, I'd say the shrimp pad Thai was our least favorite but I think at that point we were pretty full. Don't forget to get the cocktail with the flower, lychee martini I think, it was sweet, refreshing and delicious!",

    "text": "Oh man! What an experience! The service was on point. The waiter was amazing and fun. The place is beautiful and hip. The dishes were heaven.   I came to celebrate my graduation here the night before commencement. As a first timer, I was just in awe. With Andrea's eyes being the focal point of the joint, I found it kind of fun that they threw in this Andy Warhol vibe to her eyes. The restaurant was designed to appreciate beautiful women. With it's soft neutral colors to appeal to the taste of women, you can be sure to really see that pop. They also play fun hip music for you to get into that pregame party mode. To enhance a more interactive and hip experience you can flip through their alcoholic beverage selections through their fun ipad menu.  I admire their attention to detail and their ongoing efforts to make you feel special. With advanced notice of the occasion, they went ahead and customized our chopsticks with a nice announcement of my accomplishment. A cool secret tip: you can order a customized cake from the Wynn bakery in which it can be delivered and sent to your table during your dinner. All you have to do is request one. They'll even special design it for you.  The goods: Bringing Sexy Back Cocktail (Punch Bowl): this is normally made as a standard cocktail but per request they were able to make it into the size of the fish bowl. It's made with cucumber, blood orange liquor, lime juice, rock candy syrup, and their special cucumber soda. Oh...this punch bowl is served in this fun big sassy bowl with fun straws, and is big enough to share. Surely instagram worthy too!  Rock shrimp tempura: sweet and crunchy. A good recommendation.  Smoked Wagyu Beeft Tataki: It has pnzu, ginger, and green onion. It accompanies a nice table side presentation in which it is served with the smoke trapped inside a glass funnel and then released once served. It looks like smog released in a club. A smoke party. The presentation is just as good as the sliced beef tataki. Fresh and smoky.  Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna: one of their popular rolls  Saikyo Miso Black Cod: also known as butter fish. IS A MUST! You'll never feel the same way about cod ever again. It was fatty, sweet, soft, and melted in your mouth like buttah.  Sliced prime NY strip: 16 ounces of sizzling steak on a platter.   Sides: chinese sausage and pineapple fried rice with a sunny side up egg, and the pan fried noodles are a good suggestion. Also recommend the broccoli as a side.  We all ordered these dishes to table share for a party of 5, in which it was all more than enough to fill us all. The server also suggests to order the volcano chocolate cake due to taste and table presentation. As per the suggestion to the server, I second his recommendation by ordering to share with the group. It provides more variety and assortment when tasting dishes, and it makes it more fun. I was so happy to see that they also served filipino food! I never knew that Krispy Pata and Pancit can be served in a fine dining restaurant.   Expect to spend an average of $100 - 150 per person, including cocktails, tip, and tax. I cant wait to go back again!",

    "text": "Not one to leave Yelp reviews, but I feel compelled to do so after our experience.  04/07/17 Anniversary Dinner  After much research on potential dining options in Vegas for our anniversary, we decided on Andrea's.  Previous reviews had lead us to believe that we were to be \"wowed\" by an extravagant and memorable dinner on our special day.  Rather, we were \"wowed\" by the lack of service from staff and poor ambience.    Our waiter promptly came to our table and answered all questions we had about their menu.  The \"Happy Anniversary\" chopsticks were thoughtful as well.  The food: Tuna and Crispy Rice - 5/5 Diver Sea Scallops - 3/5 Saikyo Miso Black Cod - 5/5 Coconut Creamed Spinach - 4/5 Chocolate Orange Dessert (cannot recall name) - 5/5, added a point for \"Happy Anniversary.\"  Note: the runner did a fantastic job of describing our food choices. Restaurant busser was prompt.  Wine: Nice bottle list, but don't bother ordering.  The sommelier presented the wine and dropped the cap/cork (found it under my wife's feet)...things happen, not a big deal.  What bothered me more, was the fact that our glasses were twice empty for 10+ min periods and the bottle was out of reach (contemplated getting up and refilling our glasses, but felt it was inappropriate).  Though, the neighboring tables with groups of 6+ people had no problem with their glasses being filled.  We ended our meal still having 1/3 of a bottle of wine...  Ambience: If you're looking for a romantic dinner, this is not the place for you. This is a trendy, hip, \"sexy and social atmosphere.\"  I fully understand that a restaurant cannot control the conversations coming from the surrounding tables (incredibly inappropriate, to which I will not describe and loud enough for other tables to hear), but they can certainly control seating arrangements.  For instance, when a couple requests a dinner for two and include \"Anniversary\" on the reservations, please don't seat them between parties 6 and 12 people.    Based on our experience, I do not think that we would recommend Andrea's to friends visiting Vegas.  There are so many high-end restaurants that I would not suggest one that fails to \"wow.\"  Our experience was more 2.5 than 3.",

We had the pork belly appetizer, hamachi appetizer, black cod, orange sphere dessert.  Food was quite good,  sashimi and black cod were our favorites.  Volume of food was a little low.  They gave us wooden chopsticks that had \"happy anniversary ... \" engraved on them.   Little surprised that there was no complementary small culinary item (e.g. Dessert) for our anniversary.",

    "text": "The service at Andrea's (in Wynn Encore) is impeccable. Sadly, the food is not.  Really not. Andrea's claims to be \"Asian fusion.\"  As far as I can tell, it's fused the same way the top of a creme brulee is-- with a layer of sugar.   I showed up half an hour earlier than my reservation, by mistake, but the hostess graciously accommodated me.  After that, things started downhill. A common enough vodka on their menu was out of stock, despite being listed on the iPad (and thus updatable) drink menu.  No big deal; these things happen.   I started off with the kale and red cabbage salad. Tasty, with a sweet creamy dressing that complemented the slight bitterness of the kale and crispy garlic. A bit overly sweet and heavy on the dressing, but still tasty. A roasted vegetable sushi roll followed. Fine, if unremarkable and overpriced.   The main course was pailllard of Jidori chicken in an overly-sweet lemon cream sauce. Any hint of tartness in the lemon had been smothered under a huge scoop of sugar. The paper-thin piece of crispy yuba (tofu) on top overwhelmingly tasted of stale fryer grease.   Sides were: Crispy Brussels sprouts with another dessert-grade soy-sugar sauce (sweet far beyond what the balsamic vinegar provided),  Creamed spinach with coconut, pork belly cubes, shrimp, undetectable pepper flakes and garlic, and a heavy coat of Panko crumbs that went from crunchy to soggy in 3-2-1-mush. Like nearly everything else, the coconut cream sauce was so sugared that you could have used it for pina coladas.  The final side, baby bok choi was, thankfully, spared the otherwise-mandatory scoop of sugar.   Other items on the menu include Waygu beef sliders on....wait for it....sweet Hawaiian bread, torched marshmallow cake...well, you get the idea. This isn't a restaurant, it's a candy store.   Unfortunately, this is all too common a problem with even so-called \"fine dining\" in Vegas, where the kitchens seem to cook for Ma and Pa Kettle from Bumfuck, Iowa, for whom Olive Garden is the usual Big Night Out.   (Example: the restaurant at Trump sweetens their bearnaise sauce. Yes, really. As The Donald would say, \"So classy.\")  Needless to say, I skipped dessert, as I had already eaten it.   It must be repeated, though: the service is really excellent.  Too bad the chef isn't anywhere near the caliber of the waitstaff.",

The room is trendy and there's some nice intimate booths tucked away on one side. Service was top-notch, except a slow down towards the end (the bussers/runners really were on point though). Food was solid, although after dining at some other venues it's difficult to justify coming back over trying somewhere new first. For the food the biggest standout was the brussel sprouts believe it or not. They weren't very healthy, but they were damn good. My friend Roger said they were better than pecan sandies.",

I had a few strange requests and he was able to get creative and make them happen, without making me feel strange about having strange requests. One of which was asking for fresh horseradish, he answered with, \"we might have some in the kitchen, if not I'll run over to the restaurant next door and grab some for you. What?!?! Wow!!!!   The food was well prepared and tasty. Sushi was fresh and the sushi rice was perfect (which is hard to get right). Each slice of sushi was exactly of equal cut, - how good sushi is supposed to be. Very impressed.   Bakchoy was light and not greasy and with just enough crunch left.   Filet mignon was well seasoned and tender (that's what I wanted the horseradish for)  The overall experience was fantastic! Good for a fancy night out.",

We ordered the cucumber sunomono salad to start, then followed with spicy tofu sushi, fried rice, and maitake mushrooms with Kite Hill cheese- I was very impressed with the cheese!  For dessert, we had cookie dough pops, which were soft, perfect, cookie dough balls with firm chocolate exteriors, dusted with GLITTER!  Edible glitter, what?!  Note that it is very expensive here- the maitake mushroom and cheese dish was $29!  Everything across the board is delicious here, I would definitely come back!",

This gave me time to chat with Omar, the charming and well versed bartender. Cathy C came in a few moments later and after discussing mutual love for Italian Nutella, the Birthday Girl thoroughly enjoyed her Red Velvet Martini. Omar introduced me (by sample) and in a fabulous dry martini to the rare, limited edition Gold Beluga Russian vodka. We were off to a great start.  Cathy put up the whole menu on her review, so I'll cover my dishes and thoughts on the exceptional service and beautiful space. The hamachi sashimi was light with a little kick and a perfect start to the meal. Though usually not a fan of cooked salmon, their medium cooked preparation with julienned veggies was very good. Since our hostess, Amanda M works at this unique, upscale location, she filled me in on the delightful smoke aroma that would occasionally waft by. They smoke their own salmon, covered and when presented and uncovered the fragrant smoke fills the area. Your lox with fancypants presentation, if you will. Love it. Want it. Must return to have it!   Was kind of full by dessert, but went with the Cake Pop Trio. The Yuzu was delicious and I traded Michele my Red Velvet for a mini coconut ice cream cone. Eric R was happy to eat my third vegan chocolate something pop. Totally down with vegan, but chocolate I can take or leave. Crazy, I know.   So, the have a \"Music Chef\" errr DJ? Spinning some cool tunes which only adds to the whole dinner club vibe. It is a beautifully designed room, clean edges, mood lighting. No offense Steve, your wife is hot and all BUT the giant chryon light show of just her eyes facing the dining room from behind the bar was a tad creepy. But, his hotel, joint is named for her, so I guess having her eyes on the menu, too, is okie dokie with him.   The service was awesome: water glasses were constantly refilled, each dish was explained and presented with pride and professionalism. The waitress went out of her way to make sure a few guests were able to avail themselves of the 30% off drinks for locals Yelpy deal. Cathy's dessert was presented with \"Happy Birthday Cathy\" written in chocolate sauce; and they were accommodating of requests for different flavors on desserts.   So 4* for now, have a feeling when I order from the standard menu, I'll bump it up. Easily worth the $50.13 RW price and great supporting Three Square.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

Fresh, tender yellowtail sitting in a light soy with a bit of crunch from the garlic and pepper combination. Yum!  I think this is a $20 plate during normal prices.  16oz Sliced Prime NY Strip ($58): Wasabi Demi-Glace. This was pretty tasty, surprisingly FATTY, but tender and edible fats. The demi-glace was not spicy at all, but had a good flavor to it.  I found the sauce to be slightly overpowering but still good...at the price though, you are in the steakhouse category and can find considerably better quality/taste at that mark.  Fried Smashed Potatoes ($12): Thai Curry Aioli. THESE WERE AWESOME. Twice fried potatoes with a nice crispy texture, and the thai curry aioli was super flavorful! The combination was exciting!  Funny to think that this side dish would actually be the HIGHLIGHT of my meal :P  And to finish, we got hooked up with some gelato!  Banana with Shortbread Crunch, Creme Fraiche with Sake-Infused Cherries, and Honey Pistachio.  I LOVE ice cream cones, and these were yummy bites.  Honestly, the only thing I can complain about is PRICE.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all pretty good.  Check it out if you are in the Wynn :)",

It was an interesting twist executed very well, and our side of chicken fried rice went really well. We also had the hamachi sashimi, which was really simple but sauced perfectly. Their cocktail and wine selections were great too.  The service was top-notch.  Overall it was really good value.",

    "text": "Oh my sweet goodness. It's been five months since my life changing visit to Andrea's at Encoure and I swear I can still smell and taste the majestic food I enjoyed.  Mother's Day well spent that's for sure! My girlfriends and I left the kiddos in the hands of their Daddies and headed to Vegas for the weekend. We wanted one dinner where we could get dressed up, eat a hot meal, have a few drinks and savor every single moment of our night. We chose Andrea's and I thank our lucky stars!  From the moment we sat down the smells tantalized the senses. The drink menu and Sommelier on staff had us ordering more drinks than any of us initially intended to. We didn't regret even one as they were all wonderful. Although we'd browsed the menu prior to arriving, once we were there seeing food pass our table, smelling it all, we couldn't decide. The menu truly had something for all of us (sushi lovers, sushi haters, vegetarian, only eats chicken, doesn't want anything fried, etc) and boy did we order a lot! I don't quite recall all that we ordered, but I do know the sounds coming from our table while we ate probably made surrounding tables blush. Some of us tried bites of others choices and I can honestly everything was sensational.  The service was flawless. The wait staff floated in and out of our space removing plates, bringing new dishes, filling glasses, etc without us even noticing.   I'm pretty sure we floated out on clouds of happiness and splendor, although that could have been the drinks too (wink). Either way I cannot wait to visit Andrea's next time I am in Vegas and I strongly suggest you don't pass it by either!",

We were seated 25 minutes late although there were many open tables. The service was pretty bad and very slow. Our waiter was very inattentive and didn't check in mine than once and we had to get up to get the wine from the bucket because he was nowhere to be seen.  The food was a mix of great and just terrible. The sushi was very good and we can also highly recommend the wagyu chow fun and the lobster fried rice. My husband and I ordered different cuts of meat prepared with a wasabi Demi glace. It sounded delicious but, alas, it was completely bland with absolutely no flavor. Our waiter came by when we were done and asked a perfunctory \"how was everything\" and left...!  There are lots of great restaurants at the Wynn Encore resort and please avoid Andrea's so you don't end up disappointed like us",

We ordered several dishes from the sea bass, to the chow noodles, to the lettuce wraps, peppers, carrots and scallops.  I wanted to love everything, I really did. The sea bass was amazing!! Best dish we ordered. He sauces for most dishes was too over powering. And it's a shame, but  the scallops were over cooked.

Menu features fresh sushi and cooked Asian noodle and rice dishes. Portions are small and prices are predictably steep for seafood on the Strip, and it's known for being a good dinner spot before hitting up one of the clubs at the Wynn.    The sushi was fresh and the various dishes we had were well-made. The rock shrimp tempura and vegetable crispy pan-fried noodles are solid. The seafood items are their forte and the cake pop dessert samplers are a fun way to end your meal if dining as a group. Wear your cocktail dress and bring your credit card.",

FOOD: Sizzling pork belly sisig - the meat was crispy and reminded me of chicharon or carnitas. The combo with the egg was the perfect pairing.   Ramen sliders - if you've had these before at some small restaurant or fair, I wouldn't order these here. Don't get me wrong, these were quite tasty but I would definitely have chosen something else the rice never had before.   Salmon aburi - if you love salmon sushi anything, this is definitely your dish. The fish melted in your mouth and the rice to filling combo was perfect.   Uni sashimi - fresh.   SERVICE: Our waiter checked in with us often, like any other top star restaurant. They even gave us (on the house) a sample of some crab meat with cucumber foam, which was delicious as well.   PRICE: Def pricey and only a place to go to if you're balling or tryna impress someone!  I would definitely love to come back here.",

We ordered several starters to share, which I believe tasted better than my actual entree. The appetizers we ordered were Tuna + Crispy rice, Hamachi Sashimi, and Rock Shrimp Tempura. We also ordered a couple sushi rolls to share: Salmon Aburi, Shrimp Tempura + Spicy Tuna, and California Roll. The entree I ordered was Shrimp & Lobster Sauce. And for dessert, we had the Flaming Mt Fuji Flambe. From the many things I tasted tonight, I would definitely recommend the Hamachi Sashimi and the Tuna + Crispy Rice- the crunchiness of the rice really makes a difference. The dessert was also good, they light it on fire- can't go wrong with that. But all of the other starters/sushi rolls were mediocre, nothing to rave about. And I think the thing I disliked the most was the Shrimp & Lobster Sauce. It was pretty bland. The appearance is similar to an egg flower soup but it does not come close to having the strong flavors of it. The shrimp and lobster were also flavorless. Would definitely not recommend getting this dish, and definitely not worth the price point. Now the service was great and exactly what I would expect. I just wish the food was on the same level.",

    "text": "My family and I came to Andrea's before catching Le Reve in Wynn theatre. Our server recommended ordering and sharing multiple dishes family style - we went with seared foie gras, pork belly sisig, salmon aburi, yellowtail yuzu tobiko, shrimp pad thai, miso sea bass, pan seared red snapper, and rib eye in wasabi demi glaze.   For a table of 5 with not too hungry appetite - that amount of foods was just enough to keep us satisfied. Taste and presentation were on point! Personal fav - seared foie gras - that honey sauce was lick my bowl worthy! If only it came in an entree size! The steak was also very tasty - perfectly cooked and beyond delicious! The sushi rolls were forgettable however - def skip them and try another hot dish!   Service was a little lacking towards the end of our meal - took quite some time to find either of our servers (two per table) to submit our dessert order. We shared their elvis velvet with white chocolate cardamom ice cream. The ice cream was the highlight - could probably had been okay skipping the bacon caramel brittle and all the peanut overload.   Overall - Some very interesting, tasty flavor; Really painfully pricey for each dish.  Save it for special occasion but then again there are so many awesome restaurants on the strip... you decide.",

Cocktails are full measure and well crafted. My daughter and I shared a spicy tofu roll and the Impossible Burger sliders. Both were outstanding presentations of plant based foods and highly recommended. The Impossible Burger is truly a burger, just no meat! I had a veggie noodle bowl that was excellent and my daughter had the Foie Gras. She said it was now her favorite of all time, even surpassing the now defunct Rosemary's formerly on the west side of Vegas. Simply an outstanding meal, served by knowledgable staff, in a comfortable environment. The Wynn casino's take pride in their vegan/vegetarian options, and they should. They work hard to make a meal enjoyable for all types of diners.",

Multiple waiters were also assisting and left us feeling like royalty.   The food was delicious and the vegan menu was very appreciated by moi (the only veggie in the group). They also gave us a special little birthday surprise for my mom (whose birthday we were celebrating).   Everyone went above and beyond and it was a night we won't forget any time soon.

We ordered the edamame for the table which was coated with a truffle salt. The truffle flavor was a nice touch for the edamame. It set it apart from just a standard edamame starter.   I also had the beef tartar appetizer, it was served with a qual egg yolk in top. The beef was fresh and full of flavor. Once the qual egg yolk was mixed it pushed the flavor to the next level.   For dinner I had the New York strip streak in a wasabi Demi glaze. This was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The sauce was amazing. I couldn't get enough of it. I ordered my steak rare and It came out a perfect rare. It was server in a cast iron plate so it cooked slightly in the table. The chef prepared for this so even my last bite was still rare.   My fiance ordered the steamed sea bass.  I tasted a bite of it and it was also cooked great and the toppings all worked with the fish.   I would highly recommend eating here on a date or with a group. Our wait staff was pleasant and very helpful. The food didn't come out very fast but we were there to enjoy each other's company so we didn't mind. The price of the meals was in par for nice Las Vegas restaurant.",

The lights are a little dim, but it was still nice to dine at. It's a nice restaurant to definitely dress up for. It is more of an Asian Fusion restaurant. Our servers were very attentive and professional. They also recommended items and drinks on the menu for us to try. We ordered drinks, and the appetizer that we ordered was the Tuna Crispy Rice, which I highly recommend. We also ordered Wagyu Beef Sliders which was also delicious. I also enjoyed the house salad because it's always good to have some veggies on the side. We ordered the Miso Black Cod because we like fish and it was my first time trying the Miso Cod. Then we decided to order dessert. We got the shaved ice with fruit, condense milk and it comes with a cool presentation at the table. I definitely recommend that because it's not often or likely that you'll see something like this at a restaurant. Overall, the service is exceptional and the food was delicious. We had a great dining experience. I would like to come back in the future for a special occasion.",

It was a late Sunday night and we did not have a reservation, but the management saw to it that Mr. Sterling was taken care of. Within minutes eleven gentlemen were quickly seated and the service began.  Not wanting to overwhelm the staff as that many chaps can be a bit much to contend with I allowed the waiter to have the chef choose our meals. I said \"Just bring plates of your best dishes out and I will tell you when to stop.\" The flawless wait staff continually had our needs met. The wine selection was incredible, with many hard to find wines listed for excellent prices.   After at least 10 plates of food and that many bottles of wine I informed the waiter (sorry, I cannot remember his name) that Mr. Sterling would like something special for dessert and again Andrea's did not disappoint when the 'Flaming Mt. Fuji Devil's Food Cake' arrived and sent all of us over the top. I dine in the best rated restaurants all over the world as my boss demands such world class service and Andrea's is up there with the best.   The next time our team is in Las Vegas, Mr. Sterling discussed with me to call and let Andrea's know that we will be dining with them again. Bravo to a very excellent evening of delightful fare.",

There are a lot of reviews, so I'll just use this as a way to remind my future self what to (and not to) order...  Must Order: - Truffle sea salt edamame (large bowl, filling, who doesn't love truffle?!) - Seared salmon sashimi (wasabi kick which is great) - Fried rice tuna (the best bite!) - Brussel sprouts (delicious, almost dessert- like)  Depending on Party Size: - Miso cod (I'm on the fence about this one, it's pretty tasty, but never merits the price tag) - Shishito Peppers (I love shishito peppers, but for some reason these felt more like filler food)  Skip: - Ramen burger (everyone said \"interesting\", no one said \"good\") - Rock Shrimp Tempura (just meh)  Overall, Andrea's is definitely overpriced, but if you stick to the dishes you love, it will be a place you return again and again and enjoy.",

So my bill for two rolls (really one roll) and a two cup serving of fried rice and two beers was $80! My friend got a steak and his bill was $160. The food taste wasn't any better than your $6 California roll. So if you are fine with dropping a couple hundred per person have a blast,",

The restaurant is beautiful, quite open with a lounging upscale vibe.  We had perused the menu in advance, so we had a good idea of what we wanted to try.  I had the pear cocktail, which was beautiful and tasted pretty darn good to boot.  The Hubs got talked into a carafe of hot sake, which turned out to be pretty expensive, but he did enjoy it.  I found the service to be pretty slow, even with random waiters coming to our table off and on.  It didn't seem like we had one dedicated server, which may have slowed things down a bit.  For food we shared the rock shrimp tempura, ramen sliders, duck confit pad thai, and pork/pineapple fried rice with a fried egg.  The shrimp and ramen burgers were awesome.  Both dishes had great flavor and were good portion sizes.  The pad thai and fried rice were just OK.  I do wish we would have tried something else, but oh well... live and learn.  All in all we ended up spending double our credit, but walked away full and mostly satisfied.  Next time if we go I'd split some more of their appetizers as those were very tasty.",

Food might be pricey but well worth the splurge.  We had the tuna sashimi. It just melts in your mouth. And, I don't even like sashimi. I had the filet that was as tender as could be.  You must try the fried cauliflower. Oh my!!  So good. For dessert, we got the cake pops. Sounds like a strange thing to order, but they were amazing!  They were vanilla, chocolate, apple, maple and pumpkin-- so moist.  We were eating them for breakfast the next morning. Definitely can't wait to go back!!!",

The shishito (padron) peppers in a mustard miso sauce were fantastic - mostly mild but two with serious heat ...  Really enjoyed the battered black cod with yuzu pepper fries (shoestring) ... some pieces of fish could have been butchered a little bit better (I personally don't like the gray fish fat on any type of fish) and I didn't get any yuzu or pepper flavor on the fries - but that was okay with me.  My husband's scallops were fresh and well prepared, as was the accompanying foie gras - although he pushed around the edamame and farro not being a fan of either ... fingerling potatoes on the side were a bit of a flop.  My sister in law enjoyed her asparagus with preserved lemon and vegetable sushi rolls.",

Husband and I are here for a week and trying to work Andrea's back into our schedule for a 2nd visit it was so good!  - Specialty cocktails were perfect - I loved my Lychee martini - Seared Foie Gras is a must. We even contemplated ordering a second one but had to refrain ourselves to sase room for dessert - Tuna on Crispy Rice - I would come back for just this dish alone. So simple yet so perfectly paired together and the tuna was so fresh! - Pork Sisim - Make sure to stir it so that the egg is dispersed. This was flavorful but when the waiter delivered it he mentioned that they were Pig Ears and I just couldn't get that out of my head. I guess I am not as adventurous as I thought I was. Husband enjoyed it though! - Wagyu Sliders were heavenly. The meat just melts in your mouth and I loved the shoe string fries that they were served with. - Mt. Fuji Dessert - The presentation is WORTH IT! We were stuffed and concerned about paying $48 for this huge dessert when our server informed us that it came in a smaller size for $28. The small is still large enough to serve 4-6 people so we barely made a dent in it. I am glad we got to experience the awesome presentation of this but some bites were heavily flavored with the bacardi 151, and the chocolate coating made it a little too rich. We ended up just eating the inside which contained the 10 layer devil food cake.  *Ask for one of their private booths along the wall!",

Their classy and alluring style captivates you the moment you enter. They are able to combine dining with nightlife with views of Club Surrender.  The Asian-fusion styled menu features Seafood, Tableshares, Sushi, and more. I recommend to try one from each. My personal favorites:  Seared Foie Gras Toro + Tuna Roll Wagyu Beef + Lobster Wagyu A5  I haven't forgotten about their inventive cocktail list. Order their signature cocktail: Lulu - a delightful concotion.  Come dressed up and be prepared for impeccable service that matches their exotic menu.",

The beef was near raw when we received it..to the point that when I was chewing it, it felt like bubble gum. The shrimp tempura roll was excellent and the crab fried rice really didn't have any crab in it. The lobster sushi was missing lemon wedges and tasted like lobster you would get from a super market. But - again the vibes and layout was cool. Maybe this is a better place to grab some drinks at the bar.",

Andrea's is a fantastic example of class with a sexy edge.    Our group had a wonderful table and the wait staff--as is usual at all the Wynn/Encore restaurants--did a wonderful job.    Our meals included varieties of sushi, sea bass, scallops, filets, and sides of edamame, Bok Choy--and once we were done with the otherwise generally healthy dinners--we broke and had the flaming tower which is the most moist cake I have ever eaten.  This was a warm up and send off to an evening of wild fun and frivolity at Encore Beach Club evening show with Marshmallow!  A wild ride that didn't end until 4:30AM.  Our thanks to the incredible team of chefs and wait staff at Andrea's.  A perfect example of perfection.",

I wouldn't say it was a 'club' atmosphere as many other reviewers have said. We had a reservation at 9 and there were lots of tables open- but all of those filled up quickly. Our waitress was wonderful- helpful, not pushy, gave us space to enjoy our meal. We started with some Yelp favorites: tuna over crisply rice- really interesting texture. Rice reminded me of Mochi, chewy but crispy, tuna was thinly sliced, jalapeno gave a good kick (would/could skip the mayo). Hamachi sashimi- thinly sliced, nice texture with the friend garlic, light sauce. I had the scallops for my entrees which was fabulous. Cooked perfectly and the vegetable \"risotto\" was surprising good: sweet, and tender. The asparagus blew me away with the lemon preserves- and a refreshing change from the heavier entree. Canada had the ribeye and lobster. The steak was huge and perfectly cooked- he doesn't get steak often and was really happy with it. The lobster portion was small, but incredibly flavorful. And for desert they gave us cookie dough cake pops- these actually blew my mind. Would highly recommend. Wonderful overall experience, a must try.",

My party of six was seated by a window at a spacious table which had a great view of Encore pool and beach club. Great table!!  Dinner: We had edamame, mixed greens salad topped with crispy fried shallots, followed by three types of sushi: (tuna, yellow tail and veggie) orange glazed chicken, Jasmine white rice, steamed sea bass and for dessert a variety of scrumptious cake pops.   Everything we ate that night tasted fresh, of high quality ingredients and very delicious! The most memorable dish was the sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and very well seasoned! Even our starter dish of edamame was well executed. Tender with the right amount of sea salt. I have had edamame at other restaurants that was either undercooked, or over cooked to the point of where you are left with a bowl of mushy edamame pods...yuk!!  Service was excellent. Everything came out on a timely manner and very well presented. Our drink was well made which consisted of an elixir mixed cocktail with fresh berries served in a beautiful crystal dispenser with ice! It added an elegant touch of class to our table.   We ended our night at Surrender night club. We felt great and very satisfied after our meal at Andrea's. We will definitely return to Andrea's!!",

    "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember hearing one of CEO's of Wynn & Encore was a vegetarian so the restaurants inside those hotels have a good variety of vegetarian options. Went there with my colleague who was having a tough time finding good vegetarian options in Vegas especially since everything there's Meat! Meat! Meat! We made reservations, showed up a little early, and they got us a table right away and everyone greeted me by my reservation name. Their fine dining service was amazing -- with them pulling your chair out and putting napkins on your lap and always filling up your water. The waiter was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu as well. I got the vegetarian dish with the curry and it was amazing. A creamy consistency and the fake chicken tasted delicious as well. I got a side of the crispy noodles which was way bigger than I expected. The crispy noodles dish was mediocre but my colleague got this vegetarian dish with shiitake mushrooms and it was the best shiitake mushrooms I've ever tasted. My 2 dishes and a drink came up to about $70. Def worth it if you plan on splurging on fine dining in Vegas or for a special occasion. Def worth the service and price if your a vegetarian-- according to my colleague.",

My boyfriend and I came to stay at Encore last weekend to celebrate our anniversary and decided to dine at Andrea's. The customer service was impeccable. Our waiter was very gracious and even delivered us personalized chopsticks!! So cute!!! And the food... Was... Amazing (for lack of a better word). I'm usually not a huge sashimi fan, the fishy slimy texture weirds me out, but the albacore sashimi with the crispy onions were so good!!! The fish just melts in your mouth. If you're ever in Vegas, and you're a fan of sushi/Asian fusion yumminess, then you need to try this place out.    What to order:   Spicy tuna crispy rice Albacore sashimi Miso black cod My boyfriend had the beef sliders and loved it. Crispy rock shrimp   You're welcome.",

The ambiance is very chique and hip, great list of wines and cocktails, and excellent food choices. We had a large partry (10+), and they were very accomodating. We tried a bunch of little plates / appitizers, and they were all delicious (the Wagyu Beef Tataki was my personal fave).  For dinner, I had the Seared Ahi salad (delicious) and the Wagyu Rib Cap (most flavorful steak I've had in months) - however, it was only 6 oz....which is kinda small.   Come here hungry, cuz almost everything sounds delicious, and their dessert menu is something you don't want to skip! (we tried the trio sampler, and all three were awesome).",

No idea how they found them for us because that's not served here. We got the Brussel sprouts and Thai smashed potatoes. Brussel sprouts were tasty but probably similar to what you've had at other restaurants. The Thai smashed potatoes were different as it came with a side of curry sauce for dipping, delicious with or without the curry sauce. Everyone was very attentive and courteous. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and come back again.",

There is an extensive list of speciality cocktails - I tried several and they were all VERY tasty, unique, and beautiful.   Most nights they have a live DJ spinning the music - so the music throughout the evening was great, hip, (but not too distracting) and with a constant beat that put you in the mood to go out after or keep the evening going.  I love restaurants with a trendy, sexy lounge feel, yummy cocktails, and gets my evening started... Andrea's definitely gave me that.  On a side note, this would be a great place to rent out for a sexy and hip birthday party, event or engagement party.",

In my opinion the best service is the kind that the servers always there for whatever you need but they are not visibly there. Another words they watch you from a distance, before you even raise your hand they are already standing by you and ready to serve. This place is reasonably expensive, by saying so that means they earned whatever they charged you.",

Even though we were twenty minutes late for our reservation we were whisked right to our table where we selected drinks from an electronic menu. We had about five people taking care of us, which made it a bit difficult to get to know any one of them, but each was extremely accommodating and knowledgable about the menu. We started off with some delicious sashimi which was flavorful, but I'm not sure worth $20. The shrimp and pork shumai dim sum were excellent. So were the drinks, which although $16 each packed a good amount of booze.   But the real stars were the main course. I got seared diver scallops with garlicky noodles while my fiance ordered the most delicious and perfectly prepared sea bass I've ever tasted. I almost wanted to switch! Only downside was the sea bass didn't come with any sides. Small price to pay for a nicely sized slice of heaven.  The waiter didn't judge either when we ordered an espresso martini to share in lieu of their $21-$48 dollar desserts. Not only this but she personally walked us over to Surrender, a nice outdoorsy nightclub that would have set us back about 50 smackers in admission.  You won't be disappointed by the service and quality here.",

I lightly pushed my way through and came face to face with Steve Wynn. Yes, that guy. Then I heard a familiar voice, looked to the right and it was George Clooney. Ok we are off to an interesting start.  There was an entourage of about 20 people so we had to wait for an hour before we were seated -and this was with a reservation at 9!!  So we didn't even get to sit down until nearly 10pm. The people watching was interesting and the ambiance at the place was very hip.  The food was good. I had the misoyaki cod which is always good, doesn't matter where you go. The appetizers were just okay and they weren't flexible to changes.   Would I come here again?

Ok, this does happen so maybe a small pass until I get to the service. Our young server was distracted at best. He seemed unsure of his job description, almost uncomfortable at his task.

    "text": "They have Ramen Burger here. Not affiliated with the original New York guys, but if you've been craving some ramen burger, ask for it. It's not on the menu.  I dined there as soon as they opened at 6pm, it was empty. An hour later when I finished, they were about 4 other parties in the dining area and two ladies sitting at the bar.   If you ever took a taxi ride in Vegas, you're probably impressed by the \"eyes\". It's not something particular interesting, but it does stand out. If you randomly end up in this place, you'll be like \"oh that's the restaurant with the 'eyes' that Steve Wynn was bragging about.   They claim to be the first Asian restaurant to combine bar and restaurant together. I'm not sure if that's True, but I do know it's not the best restaurant with a bar. I'd think if they tried to put a bar and a restaurant together, they'd want to do it seamlessly. To me, the bar is really isolated from the main dining area. Maybe they don't want the drunk/over-social bar patrons to disturb their dinner guests, but it could be executed better.  Service at Andrea's is really good and professional. Many cute guys are working there. I kinda wish my waiter wasn't like a robot and lacked personality.   As for the food, I really can't say I liked it. The ramen burger I had (2 for $18) needed more flavors on ramen. It was my first time trying ramen burger, so I really didn't know what to expect, but one thing that could be said is that their ramen doesn't pair well with the meat patty, not in the way the ramen is (not) cooked. (no flavor) I was also disappointed when I found out the ramen used was probably made from fried ramen you can buy at a 99-cent store. They were all sticking together after I took a bite instead of breaking into a million pieces, good job chefs!",

We had a private booth with chain like curtain to draw for more privacy if we wanted that. We started with cocktails and they made great drinks. Armando was the mixologist that was tending the bar this evening and I gave him my specific instructions for my cocktail which he executed perfectly. Our server was very helpful in guiding us through the menu seeing it was our first time there. Every dish we had was delicious, one of our favorites was seared scallop with sauteed pork belly and it was delicious! We had a lovely evening and made another reservation to return 3 nights later for a repeat performance. Our server was friendly, polished, professional and really knowledgeable about their various dishes. It wasn't inexpensive, but the quality was there to justify it!",

It was more a joke because her name is Andrea so I thought it would be a fun twist. We made reservations and were promptly seated. Our waiter Christopher was extremely friendly and helpful. After taking our drink orders that was the last time he came back to us. The rest of the night we were juggled between three other waiters. It felt a bit odd. I had the sea bass. My first time ever eating it. It was nothing short of amazing. Best fish I've ever eaten. My wife had pad Thai which she didn't finish. It was a large portion. It was so expensive that I wish she hasn't eaten more. The sushi we had was like most sushi. Not bad at all, just normal. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the slow service from our three different waiters.",

We had the black code as well as the asparagus, dim sum and the rice with vegs and fried eggs!! The quality is good and the service very impressive, not to mention the incredible ambience experience...the only thing to not is that if you are looking for a red wine you will not find any bottle cheaper than 50$... Also they made us wait a bit but may be it was because of the very busy night. I would definitely recommend Andrea's!",

I'm pretty sure that babies   are safer in strollers than being carried when it's a lot easier to drop them. Then when we tried eating at Andrea's they refused us service due to bringing our 8 moth old son! Pure age discrimination if I have ever seen it.  Not only that there was not a sole customer in the entire restaurant and our baby was sleeping and even then they refused us! We tried to get take out but after looking for a place to eat it all the policies prohibit eating their food anywhere on the premises. The manager Roy suggested that we eat at one of their casual restaurants but when we tried to go to Red8 . As we walked up the hostess very rudely said no strollers and again we were denied service due to having a baby. I ask her very nicely what we were supposed to do with our sleeping baby and she repeated the phrase \"NO Strollers\"  At this point my wife was in tears and stormed away. I can't believe they treat babies this way.",

After searching (and searching) restaurants in Vegas, we decided on this place for a special birthday dinner. We sure made the right choice!! Amazing food with exceptional service.. this is one of the BEST restaurant experiences I've ever had.. from our private booth, to the engraved chopsticks, to the excellent customer service and amazing food! This place deserves all the stars it can get!! Ariel was our waitress and she was sweet, super nice, and very attentive. We ordered yummy drinks (Bringing Sexy Back and Cold Fusion), Tuna & Crispy Rice (best appetizer EVER! Could have just ordered this and been happy!), Crab Fried Rice, Philadelphia Roll, Rainbow Roll (so good!), and Crispy Pork Shank Pata. The food was amazing!! I think what did it for us, though.. in addition to the beautiful restaurant and good food was the wonderful customer service! Thanks for the great restaurant experience, Andrea's! We will definitely be back!",

The 2 Hostess seemed very disinterested in assisting any guests and felt like they rather be somewhere else besides working. Our group had time use the restrooms and do 2 laps around the Encore casino before we were even seated. The manager came up to the hostess and asked them a couple of questions and he proceeded to walk to the back of the house and still we were standing and waiting impatiently. Eventually one of the hostess came up and asked is your party here and I got a little smart and said we have been right here for the last 15 minutes past our reservation time. I was thinking you checked us in and saw that our group of 8 was here... Go figure...The 2 star rating was mainly for the poor service upon checking in and the wait time past our scheduled reservation. Hopefully they realize that Vegas is a tourist town especially during Super Bowl Weekend. The environment that they portrayed to our group was that they are a little stuck up.   On the other hand the food was excellent! Server was very nice and addressed our concern with one of the drinks. And the food came out quickly and hot! Checkout the pics...Everything tasted excellent.",

My husband and I came in very early right when they opened, and didn't realize how hungry we were. When this dish came out, we both devoured it. I'm telling you, you want these!  We sat at the bar, and the female bartender greeted us promptly. Unfortunately, we don't remember her name, but she was very pleasant. She informed us that they had just launched a new cocktail menu the day prior, and suggested a cocktail called a \"Trust Me, You'll Love It.\" And I did.",

I grew up in Louisiana and other areas of the Gulf Coast so I'm very familiar with a wide variety of fish. I wasn't expecting five star but this was sub standard by any measure. The \"hostess\" set the tone by saying there would be a wait for a table when only about 10% of the tables were occupied. By comparison our dinner following night at Le Cirque was amazing. Andrea's is a very forgettable restaurant. Do yourself a favor and find another dining location.",

This was a pleasant surprise.   We went with some Vegan friends and had not intended to eat ONLY Vegan, but we ended up 95% Vegan for the whole meal.  The first non-vegan item we had was the tempora Sprimp   This was not the traditional tempora,  It reminded more of a heavy battered shrimp with the traditional spicy sweet sauce served in all Asian restaurants.    The rest of our meal was all Vegan and let me tell you, it was delicious!   We started with the Vegan Gyoza.  It tasted like it was stuffed with sweet potatoes and had a beautiful mushroom broth that was a great compliment.  We had the Thai Chicken Curry...(Vegan) ....awesome!   and the Brussel sprouts were probably one of the best I have ever had...  Finished it all with the dessert Vegan Cookie Dough Cake Pops... Let me tell you, do NOT skip these.  They were awesome.",

Everything is taken in to account. All dietary needs are asked when ordering and they even have special menus for vegetarians and vegans.   I had the steamed sea bass and it was absolutely amazing. Friend had the $65.00 bone in ribeye. He said it was terrific. The sides are all ala carte, so when you order, that's all you get unless you want broccoli or potatoes etc then that's extra.   As we were sitting there, Steve Wynn walked in with his wife and body guard. He frequents the establishment a lot since he actually lives on the property. So don't be surprised when you see him walking around. The staff all day he is just so nice. Yes I would have taken a picture with him. The restaurant is actually named after his wife and the eyes on the back wall ate her eyes.   All in all it is a great place. Very expensive but worth it if you have the money.",

The owners ex-wife's eyes watch you from above the bar. An interesting conversation starter.   The predominantly white space with dim lighting is modern but elegantly appointed and well thought out. The attention to detail is apparent, but translates to the meal in addition to the ambiance.   We've always requested a private booth because it's a \"special occasion\" restaurant for us. In those, it's quite and very romantic.   The booths are private, individual high walled seats that line the side of the restaurant. You walk up two steps to enter and they have silver beads hanging along the edge. The lighting is dim.   Upon arriving they invited us to enjoy a cocktail At the bar. I had a delicious glass of sparkling Rose & my husband a manhattan. Made to perfection like everything here.  Before dinner cleanser was an avocado gazpacho. Loved it.  On this occasion my husband ordered the Crunchy salmon sashimi - it was out of this world. The crunch gave it a unique texture you don't typically experience with sashimi. The fish itself could not have been more fresh.  I had the sea bass for the second time. It is the best sea bass I've had in my life. It's exquisite in a very light butter. We also ordered a side dish of bok choy to share. Yum. I think it was steamed.   For the occasion they brought us two cake pops. They were super. I never eat those but delish.   Liked the novel Two way chopsticks- adorable and to add to their unmatched customer service, they wished us a happy anniversary by branding the message into a wooden take home set of chopsticks with our names. I love this place! They exceed my expectations every time! Thank you!",

We had: spicy tuna crispy rice, yellowtail, pad Thai, wagyu sliders, some coconut soup, Brussel sprouts, and s filet with an orange balsamic glaze. Everything minus the steak that was a warm dish came out cold. Have u had fried Brussel sprouts or Broccoli cold? It's gross    Nothing tasted special or extraordinary- but to me that's the standard of Vegas dining, especially at the Wynn. I really only enjoyed the filet and sliders- everything else I've had much better of elsewhere.   My other pet peeve: it's busy so prepare to WAIT for your food.   I doubt I'll be back.",

When we arrived we got seated immediately for a table of 19. It was a comp dinner so entrees were selected.   We had two huge fish tanks of alcohol with a pour spout for the table.  First to come out was steamed edamame sprinkle with a little salt (delicious). Next were three different rolls of sushi, followed by the main entree. They brought out crispy pieces of chicken paired with chow mein. Everything was really tasty.   For dessert my friends had something special planned for me. They brought out two different signature desserts. And one of my friends had a huge Minnie customized cake made for me. One of the desserts was a chocolate frosted mountain cake that they pour alcohol on and set it on fire. It is definitely a must if you go here. The next one was a delicate shaved ice with syrup and fresh fruit, underneath a dry ice display. Both desserts tasted fantastic. As for my cake we did not get to cut into it.   Thank you Andrea's for such a wonderful dinning experience, I cannot wait to come back.",

    "text": "Hello welcome to Andrea's. We were greeted  by a very friendly and confident hostess.We sat down and the nice lady pulled and put our napkins on our laps for us. Very classy, She said our waiter Alan would be along shortly. Before I could even think about how long that might take he was right there taking drink orders. Water for the table and he gave us menus and a drink Ipad, The decor here is not what I expected from the few photos I had sen in the past. I want to be able to describe it but I guess 70's fusion with modern accents, We made our drink orders. Josie had a drink, Cranberry crush our other friend Samantha got a pear blossum.  Both were well mixed and were not stingy with the alcohol. I ordered a beer Hitachino Nest Red Rice Beer. The notes in this beer really paired well with the Asian fusion meal we were about to experience. We also ordered a Sparkling Saki. I am not normally a Saki fan but this was quite good. Let's get to eating. This meal was truly an experience, it was pricey for my normal budget but well worth every penny. This is our splurge best friends dinner so we budgeted for this as we do all of our special meals out with friends. We started with a table share Pork Sisig. How do I explain this. Its pork belly, pork cracklin, Jalapeno and a few other spices. This also has a fried egg on top. Alan advised the best way to eat it was to cut the egg and get the yolk mixed in and eat it as a hash. So flavorful and rich, it went across the pallet and had great salty notes and pork goodness. So good we ordered another. We also had Salmon and Albacore Sashimi. Both with great cuts and knife work and a sauce I did not get the name of. Main courses. I had The Pan seared Salmon with smoked mussels and Maitake mushrooms, The Salmon had a real nice crispy skin cooked a perfect medium(a good restaurant knows to ask how guest wants it cooked), I could eat the mushrooms alone they had such great richness. Fish flaked nicely and was easy to take apart with chop sticks. I paired it with a Smoked Bacon Fried rice. This rice had Bacon that had an incredible deep smoked flavor. Every bite of both my dishes had me really wanting more. Josie ordered chicken adobo which had a great sour bite that you expect from Adobo food. Dalton had an egg wrapped Pad Thai, The egg wrapped steamed in the flavor and the noodle came across the pallet with a True Umami. I have never had Pad Thai this good,  We ended the meal with a flaming desert, Mt,Fuji, marshmallow covered devils food cake and chocolate moose. Covered with 151 and lit on fire. The campfire marshmallow taste added with the rich moose and devils food was amazing.This desert was so big we actually gave the couple sitting next to us a couple plates to share with us. This was a dining experience and worth the time and money. Our server Alan was very knowledgeable of the food and the drinks. He was ever present and our drinks were never wanting. We never felt rushed and enjoyed every second. Goodbye, and thank you for dining at Andrea's. As we left the exit was as friendly as the entrance, The staff here really promote the experience. We will be back and you need to check this out. You will not be disappointed.",

They seated us immediately upon arrival. They have our group a set menu that would stay within our price range. There was a vegetarian option.  We had 2 servers and one waiter attending us.   The food was delicious and they even personalized chop sticks for the bachelorette.   The decoration was beautiful. It was clean and such a great place to dine.   We will definitely come back.",

    "text": "First off - let me preface this review by saying I am NOT a fancy resteraunt type girl. I love comfort, sloppy food that's hearty and filling. I'm also a vegan so this makes this difficult at times.  I planned a suprise bachlorette weekend in Vegas for my bestfriend and I wanted to have every detail planned, including meals. Being vegan - it's hard to find places I can take my omni friends but I found out that the owner of the Wynn hotels is a vegan himself so every place in his hotel offers a seperate vegan menu (YAY!).   We got dolled up and arrived for our 6:30 reservation. It was a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty at that time. We sat at the bar beforehand and ordered a cocktail from their  ipad menu. Our server was SO attentive and sweet. I wish I remembered her name. The service was unreal - SO accomodating, which I'm not used to.   We ordered the truffle sea salt edamame (OMG SO GOOD), the vegan chicken lettuce wraps (that sauce is unreal), my friend ordered the pan-seared chicken breast (she said it was the best she's ever had), the Gardein chicken entree (can't even begin to explain how in love I was), and shared a side of the vegan smashed potatoes with spicy aoili. We ordered a vegan chocolate chip cake pop for each of us for dessert, along with the vegan tart.  Everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. From start to finish it was on point. The flavors are incredible and it was presented beautifully. We couldn't stop raving about it.  If I'm ever in Vegas again, will definitely be coming here. It is expensive, but you probably already know it before making a reservation.",

We ordered:  Hamachi Sashimi - it was super fresh and served with a sliver of dried garlic on top.   Seafood On Ice for 2 - Served with 4 oysters (2 from each coast), lobster salad, 2 king crab legs, Ahi Tuna poke and scallops.   Wagyu Sliders with shoestring potatoes - on Hawaiian bread buns served with housemade banana ketchup.   Crispy Brussel Sprouts -  just maybe one of the best things ever. OMG...so good  At the end of our meal, they brought us complimentary vanilla cupcakes with cream cheese frosting served with white chocolate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it.   The server we had (I forgot his name, but he had a shaved head and glasses) was the sweetest.   This place is worth every penny. They pay such close attention to detail and we enjoyed all of it.   Well done, Andrea's!",

    "text": "***************************** 1,028 *******************************       It was still CES 2014, Andrea's was 1 of the restaurant that my customer's held a happy hour here. Our team came in and stayed back for dinner at bar.        Andrea's is such a lovely place, swanky, modern, and so chic. The new hot dining spot in Las Vegas is Andrea's at Encore Hotel. Music popping, live DJs provide the night's soundtrack  and the LED displace with Andy Warhol art, the eyes continues changing colorful. The spacious 2 levels dining room, with booths on the side and more than 30 sits at the bar area, a little bit for everyone.        Chef Joseph Elevado combines hip Asian dining with a sexy atmosphere. Chef Elevado's menu features Wagyu beef and lobster roll, rock shrimp tempura, and NY Strip Steak with Wasabi demi glace.  - Delicious grilled calamari salad, off-the-menu, ordered by a nice bartender that was serving us.  - SHISHITO PEPPERS mustard miso and CUCUMBER Sunomono salad were both good.   - SEARED ALBACORE SASHIMI crispy onions, ponzu - The albacore was nice but was hidden under the pile of crispy onion. It was so overpowering for us.   - Uni, Otoro were over priced compare to other sushi places in Vegas, and trust me, I've been to plenty.  - BAKED KING CRAB HAND ROLL soy paper, sweet mayo -  this was quite pleasant, tiny roll like my 2 fingers together, but surely worth $18. MUST ORDER  - HAMACHI SASHIMI* crispy garlic, pickled cherry pepper, cilantro, sudachi soy - this was good. $20  - SCALLOP SASHIMI parsley salsa verde $20 this was very nice, MUST TRY  - KIMCHEE, EDAMAME + TOFU FRIED RICE - love it  - SHRIMP AND PORK SHUMAI DUMPLINGS - this was surprisingly good.   - TUNA AND CRISPY RICE* pickled jalapeno, spicy mayo, kecap manis - this was OK $24        The cocktails menu was very creative, pricey but well worth it to try. You got to slide through the iPad menu to see the picture of the cocktail before you order it, I like that. The wine list was impressive and wines by the glasses were reasonable. COCKTAIL: Mango sashimi cocktail is a MUST ORDER after dinner.        Our bartender was very attentive even though it was so busy that day during CES 2014.  The food was good but not as exceptional as other sushi that I've been to in Las Vegas, but still 1 of my top Asian Fusion food spots in Vegas. However, I love the ambiance, the drinks, and the whole vibe here. It's such a perfect spot for a large group to dine in or late night dining here on the weekend with live DJs.",

    "text": "Great food coming from the kitchen but too bad the front of house is an anchor around the neck of their good work.   Delicious appetizers, prepared well. Ingredients must be top quality for them to taste this good. Particularly loved the spicy fried chicken. Really crunchy with a very well-balanced sauce of sweet and spicy goodness. The steak entree with wasabi demi-glace was out of this world. Flavorful, tender beef, cooked to perfect medium rare. I would go back again and again to eat this food, if not for.....  The crappy service. Let's start with the fact that my water glass was refilled only once without me having to ask or request it. And then there is the menu. Is this a restaurant you're supposed to share or not? It's not clear. And the server didn't explain. I ordered a steak and when everything was delivered, it was all put into the middle of the table. When I looked puzzled at this, the steak was put in front of me. But they didn't bring me a side plate to have some of the side dishes that are clearly meant to be shared. My choice was to either dump spoonfuls of it into the wasabi demi glace that was on my cast-iron oval steak platter, or eat it directly from the shared plates. So I improvised by removing the plate from underneath the cast iron platter that the pork belly appetizer was served on. It was very bizarre to be at a table where some people were sharing and some not. If the server had explained, that could have helped. Or if those of us at the table were able to effectively communicate with one another in advance. But that was difficult because...  The dining room was loud. So much louder than it needed to be. And the boomp-boomp-boomp-boomp soundtrack is more appropriate for the nearby dance club than for a fine dining restaurant. Lively atmosphere is great, but somehow here it veered more appropriate for cocktail party than for sit-down dining.  I had such high hopes going in. And the kitchen didn't disappoint at all. They're pros. But too much thoughtlessness in the front of house. One last note on that. Coffee was delivered. But it took at least three more minutes for the cream and sugar to be delivered. And I had to ask for it. What the heck?  I'm sure I'll be staying at the Encore again. But this was so disappointing that Andrea's won't be visited again. They could learn a lot from the front of house at Mizumi.",

I was so excited to eat something gluten free for dinner that wasn't just a salad! My dinner plate was delicious and my dessert was just as appetizing.

Well we arrived and seated promptly. The waiter had to have been high on something because he was completely out of it to the 10th degree. We order two drinks. A crown on the rocks and the dream cocktail. I order the dream with little hibiscus. The drinks come some time after. The crown comes in a shot glass! No extra glass with ice no nothing. My drink comes with extra hibiscus. When I ask he tells me it's made correctly. I order this drink often at other establishments and know it was made wrong but wasn't going to sit and argue with the waiter. We order our food only to have our wagyu filet come out a completely different steak. When we let the waiter know he says \"oh yes it is let me offer you a different cut that is already prepared \" how about offer what we ordered that was the more pricey cut. After waiting over a hour for the wrong order we decline a cheap cut that was \"already prepared\" after another 300$ bill we left less then satisfied. I don't think we'll be giving this place a third chance!!",

The sauce was so good my wife was scraping up what was left with a fork!  It'll cost you to go here but I don't mind paying as long as the food and service are superb, and Andrea's delivered a great dining experience in all areas.",

Andrea is Steve Wynn's wife and it's her gorgeous eyes that are featured on the wall and menus. The service was very good and I'll surely be back!",

I order 6 different sushi/ sashi and it took over an hour to get served half my order. My friend that ordered a cooked entree, got and ate their dinner by the time my 3rd order of sushi came by.  Other than that, it's hard to go wrong with the non sushi menu.",

    "text": "ok i keep going back and forth 3 or 4 stars so lets say 3.5 i went with a group of yelpers for restaurant week and I'm definitely glad I did. the place is beautiful with great ambiance. All the lines of the place are clean cut and it is quite the trendy decor.  They have good music playing and we got good entertainment speculating on the couple next to us we claim were on their first date...lol.....people watching was great!  The service was excellent as they kept our water glasses full and were attentive to what we asked for.  They answered questions and worked well together as a team.   For the appetizer I got the chicken potstickers, and they were good and light and the dipping sauce had a kick but wasn't overly spicy.  Definitely needed the dipping sauce though for flavor.  Next I got the filet with the hollandaise on the side.  It came with potatoes on the side as well.  Now the meat was cooked well and tender but needed more seasoning so definitely had to use the hollandaise sauce.  I like my filets and usually I can eat them without the sauce and be quite satisfied.  Next came the ice cream trio.  I had coconut yogurt, sake cherry and pistachio honey.  I traded the yogurt with Christie O. for her red velvet cake pop.  The sake cherry was the best of the bunch but I love pistachio usually.  Thanks Christie for trading though as I usually am not a cake pop fan and this place makes them great!  Everyone at the table got different flavors though and as far as I knew we didn't get a choice.  I didn't drink as I was going straight to work but the drinks did look fabulous.   I did like this place and would recommend it, the fried rice varieties at the table did look great and the salmon on ice presentation looked great and I would like to try to that too.  So I would go back and get the regular menu items.   Thanks for a great evening and the invite; thanks to Amanda and her husband, Cathy, Eric and Lisa, Christie and Kevin.  First fall restaurant week 2013 was definitely fun!",

The hostess told us it was first come first served so we grabbed a table only to be told that since we were (the guys) wearing shorts that we couldn't dine there. I'm sorry but I work at one of the highest grossing restaurants in the country (in NYC) and people can walk into there wearing whatever they want! We are in fucking Las Vegas get over yourselves honestly!!!!",

The bartender was helpful in all of us finding something to suit our tastes. While we sat at the bar the bartender went out of his way to discuss wines with my Father and then let us try various wines to find the best one to go with our meal.  The waiter so also really helpful as we didn't want to eat meat they recommended a lot of other dishes including plenty of options for my mum who is a vegetarian. You MUST try the crispy rice and tuna - we wish we had have ordered more.  The desserts were also great as well. Fantastic espresso martini's to go with them and end the meal on. Overall really happy and will be a staple to any future Vegas trips.",

Their response was that they were really busy that night. It's Vegas...I'm not sure what they were expecting but that response won't cut it.   Food was good but doesn't make up for the rest. We had a selection of hand rolls.  There's a number of places you can eat on the strip and it's not exactly a cheap spot. I'd recommend elsewhere.",

This was Super Bowl weekend and the entire resort was buzzing as expected, but this place was absolutely packed! We checked in with the hostess and had a few cocktails in the lounge to start. There was a DJ playing the perfect mix for the environment, lights were dim and the vibe if the restaurant was nothing but energized. We were sat at 10:03pm so the wait wasn't that bad at all for our group.  Our server who did an amazing job considering how busy the restaurant was, he suggested we start with a sushi and sashimi platter that blew our party away, pictures attached!!! Andrea's easily competes with Nobu, Yellowtail, Shibuya and Kabuto in our humble sushi opinion. We then took our servers suggestions and ordered a couple NY steaks , panfried noodles, crab fried rice, ponzu broccoli and eggplant.   You have to trust me and order the NY Strip on the sizzling platter, the smell was absolutely out of this world and the flavor better than that. The group sitting next to us asked for a bite and ordered it after they also smelled it coming through the dining room. We didn't have time or room for desserts, but I'm not too concerned as we will definitely be returning to Andreas.",

SOOOO much better than SWITCH.  The restaurant and bar itself is gorgeous.  I am not a fan of everything white typically as it reminds me of Florida or my Grandma's house, however, this mostly white theme was done tastefully.  We opted to eat at the bar as we normally do even though we had reservations (I would probably suggest reservations as it was pretty packed).  The bartenders were super friendly and accomodating even though they were obviously slammed.  I honestly can't recall the names of what we had, but we had a few things to share and everything was sooooo good!  However, we probably ingested a little too much tempura as we felt SOOOO full for a good 2 hours after leaving, but quite happy.  We will definitely return to Andrea's on our next visit and will be sure to stay late to check out the DJ and the later crowd!!!",

    "text": "Boyfriend and I stayed at the Encore and were planning on eating at a restaurant at the Aria on Saturday night. On Thursday, we walked by Andreas just to check it out. An employee named Trevor there graciously gave us a tour of the restaurant, described the food and told us that if we dined there he would personally escort us to Surrender nightclub next door after our meal to skip the line. He has us sold; we canceled our Aria rez and dined here.   Trevor and his team served us; and it was likely the most exceptional service we have experienced at a restaurant. The passion with which Trevor described the things he suggested we order was outstanding. I don't even like cucumber but with the way he described a cucumber cocktail on the menu, I couldn't help but say no. Same with the dessert; we don't love chocolately things but the way Trevor described the \"orange sphere\" captivated us. He not only described what was in the desert, but the origins of the chocolate in it. Had us sold... Again. When we told him what an outstanding employee he was, he humbly told us that it was a team effort and pointed out his team members.   So now for the food:   * Tuna + crispy rice appetizer: this was so good and so flavorful I almost wanted to get another order. It comes with four pieces and is a good amount to share. The tuna is flavorful and the crispy rice gives it great texture.   * Shrimp tempura + spicy tuna roll: also fantastic. Loved the mango in it. The roll was flavorful, fresh, with just the right amount of crunch. And not too much rice which can ruin a roll.   *Shrimp pad Thai: this is very uniquely presented. Instead of having scrambled egg mixed it, the pad Thai comes enclosed in a thin pillow made out of egg. Almost looks like a crepe. I wish I took a picture! This was a fantastic take on pad Thai and I would definitely order again. NOTE: we orders this \"spicy\" and I'm glad we did, otherwise it would not have enough kick to it   *Toro sushi: at $40 for two pieces, this is a Huge waste of money. I've had much fresher, better toro at other sushi restaurants for much less. This is the one order we regretted.   *Orange sphere desert: this desert reminds me of a fancy version of those chocolate oranges wrapped in foil that you hit to break open. If you like those, and love chocolate, this dessert is for you. It is a but rich but the presentation is spectacular.",

    "text": "My wife and I were there for the opening night of this new Restaurant. Didn't think we'd be able to get a table but when we walked up they were very nice to accommodate us even though it looked fairly full.   While waiting, we were able to take a look at the decor, people, etc... I personally really liked the clean and hip look of the place and where the tables were in relation to the bar and other parts of the restaurant. The main dining area was slightly elevated from the lounge area, thus creating a separation but was close that it didn't feel like I was disconnected to the bar area where there were a lot of people to watch. It definitely isn't the place if you want a quiet-dinner-for-two, but for my wife and I, it was great.  Once we got seated, we decided to choose multiple small plates so that we can try different things. We had a sushi roll, a noodle dish with duck, crab cake/ball, and some items from the dim sum menu. The food was generally a 3.5 out of 5 for us because it didn't blow us away but we couldn't really say anything too bad about it. It was just what you'd expect at an Asian fusion menu and not much more...  There was one thing that we really didn't like -  1) Maybe because it was the opening night but they had way too many people working on the floor! Usually having enough staff to make sure that you are properly and timely taken care of is key to a good experience. In the case of that night, it was uncomfortably filled with workers where they were everywhere and standing around between tables, along the walls making it very distracting to have so much crowd stand around and walk between the tables. I sure hope that gets adjusted quickly.  With that said, our server, Ryan, was excellent - tried to give our space but was very attentive and informative.   All in all we would likely return especially if staying at Wynn/Encore.",

The waiters stand along side the walls at all times just to be available whenever you need them. It is pricey for sure but you are getting every bit of what you pay for. For instance my Filet mignon was $60 (the most I have ever paid for filet mignon) but it was the most tender, best flavored and cooked to perfection for my liking that I have ever had. It came with a trio of delicious sauces which it didn't even need because it was so good. We also had the crispy brussel sprouts, the fried mashed potatoes with thai curry sauce, the beef and shrimp fried rice, and the Ramen sliders.  Besides the filet mignon I have to say that the Ramen sliders were amazing and totally different than anything I'd had before. The ramen was  cooked and used as the buns on the slider and it was a really cool and delicious dish....brought back memories if you use to eat raw Ramen as a kid only this is not raw.  The drinks were all very tasty.  It has a huge menu to choose from sushi, steak and seafood, pasta dishes, etc. Best restaurant I have been to in awhile.  Everything was tasty.  Definately recommend getting reservations ahead of time.",

I went there on a Thursday and there was a local special which is $7 food and drink items!  I ate with a friend and we had amazing food and drinks for $35 at an upscale restaurant. I am also going again this Thursday! They had a dj and this is something that stuck out to me because most restaurants wouldn't dare try this.  The DJ played 80's, funk, and soul. I go out a decent amount and I kept saying oh I love this song I love that song! It is a really cool atmosphere when you can add some music without being intrusive. I think the dj added something great to this place.   The decor is outstanding! There are eyes that change colors on a giant screen when you walk in. There are tear drop lights throughout the restaurant and my goodness the chairs were so comfortable I didn't want to get up. It could have been all the yellowtail or dim sum that I ate haha! I give this restaurant 5 stars.",

I am a foodie, and this place offers a great atmosphere as well. They deserve five stars simply because first impressions make the difference.",

We had made a reservation for the earlier side after reading reviews here that it gets very loud and clubby later on, so our 7:00 res was on the mark to start off our first night. We were seated relatively quickly after grabbing a quick cocktail at the bar. An Aphrodisiac with Lemon Belvedere Vodka and Elderflower Liquer was my drink of choice and WOW, it was refreshing and delicious! So much so, my friend changed her drink order and we continued with those during dinner. Excellent!   We were seated near the Sushi kitchen where 5 sushi chefs were working away creating rolls and fresh sashimi. Our first appetizer was the Hamachi which was delectable and soooo fresh. Didn't want that to end! Next up the Shrimp and Pork Gyoza, also tasty. My friend then dined on the Rock Shrimp with Shitake mushrooms and side of lomein, which she loved while I had the tuna and shrimp tempura roll, a great pick as well. We were both pleased with our meals. Of course I had to try a little something sweet and enjoyed every bit of the Chocolate And Coffee dessert which had not just a beautiful presentation but was well worth the calories.   Throughout the evening, very cool clubby like music was playing, not too crazy loud but then again, we left around 9 so maybe it gets crazy later? Either way, we loved the atmosphere, the service and the food. This place is pretty hot to look at too, so I've uploaded a few pics as well...Fun night!",

I would make a reservation, as there are only a few tables near the bar for walk-ins, which are fine, but the atmosphere is better in the midst of the dining room. We sampled two of the sushi rolls: rainbow roll + shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll, both were excellent. The shrimp tempura and spicy tuna was the real winner in my opinion. Cocktails were also on point. I had a Hendriks and tonic, my friend had a dirty martini, we were both very pleased. At the end of our evening, the waiter also let us know the for dining with them, we received complimentary access to the adjoining night club, Surrender, which we did not take him up on, but handy to note..!",

We had some edamame, spicy shisito peppers, spicy tuna rolls, some kind of house salad, veggie friend rice and giant prawns! Everything was very tasty, but I wish we had gotten more! We also had some kind of Patron punch bowl and I typically stay FAR FAR away from Patron but I indulged and pretty much got wasted! It was super fun though!   Also, when I checked in an offer popped up for Locals - you can get an Andrea's discount card, 30% off all drinks anytime (except on top of another special). Good deal since drinks are rather spendy. I tried the White Sangria and it was DELISH!!   I am looking forward to doing another dinner there sometime in the near future!",

    "text": "I stopped by Andrea's at 10:30pm on Valentines Day for drinks and snacks before heading to XS. The place had a very lounge-y feel and everyone dining inside looked REAL good (cuz it's valentine's day). The place was dark and romantic and packed with people.  For food, we got the steamed edamame, seared foie gras bao and the wagyu beef sliders.  -The edamame had a really really strong truffle taste, which could be good depending on your preference. I thought the truffle flavor was a little too strong and over-powering.[$10]  -The wagyu beef sliders were amazing. The meat was soooo juicy and it went perfectly with the Hawaiian roll. I didn't really enjoy the shoestring potatoes that came it . It would have probably been better with regular fries.[$24]  -The seared foie gras bao was also really flavorful. I can clearly remember the pinepple in the bao that gave the foie gras a tangy taste. [$30]   The main reason we went to Andrea's was to try their punch bowls. We were disappointed when we did not find it on the drinks menu (on an Ipad), but after talking to our server, we realized that you can make any of the cocktails a punch bowl. We went for the Showstopper. The punch bowl was $80 and BOY it was strong. It was literally a huge bowl of dranks and it made 4 people buzzed. I strongly do not recommend this punch bowl to be shard only between two people but for $20 a person, not too bad of a deal.  My real problem with this place was the service. I was being ignored for a good 15-20 minutes where I had to actively try to wave down a server. I was so angry I almost walked out. Granted it was Valentine's Day, a restaurant in the Wynn, charging such high prices should not leave any tables ignored. The only reason why I didn't pursue this horrible service was because I got drunk off the punch bowl.   Honestly, I don't think I will go back to Andrea's for the food, or slow service. I will only go back for another punch bowl because it was tasty and it got the job done.",

    "text": "Have dined here numerous occasions on a comp dinner prior to going to Surrender Nightclub, and have always thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The fish tanks of alcohol, endless edamame/selected entrees, always made for a perfect meal prior to a long night of intoxication.   I am big on trying new upcoming foods and was ecstatic to hear Andrea's at the Wynn was going to be first in Las Vegas to carry the Impossible Burger!! We headed there on Thursday April 19th, excited and eager to give these products a try!!  The Impossible Burger is a vegan burger. It is \"made entirely from plants; but made to look, smell, cook, and taste like ground beef but with a much smaller environmental footprint...The Impossible Burger uses about 75% less water, generates about 87% fewer greenhouse gases and requires about 95% less land than conventional ground beef from cows. It's also produced without hormones, antibiotics, artificial flavors and is cholesterol-free.\"   Going into the meal, I was extremely skeptical among my excitement. I am not a heavy carnivore, and tread on the idea of being a vegetarian/vegan myself. I am extremely conscious of where my meat/vegetables/food are sourced from and always opt for fresh, organic, non-GMO options when available. When I look for vegan/vegetarian alternatives specifically, I look for fresh natural ingredients used, over any GMO/soybased alternatives.   We decided to order two out of the three Impossible Burger items on the menu. We would have ordered all three menu items, but were mislead by the menu title (we could not find it on the menu till reading the full descriptions; title labeled \"Ma Po Tofu\"). We ordered 1.) the Impossible Burgers as Sliders, and 2.) the Thai Crispy Rice Cups. The Sliders came as three sizzling sliders, topped with frisee, kimchee, pickles, kalbi sauce and kochujang aioli. The Thai crispy rice cups were made with Impossible Burger, along with mint, cilantro, chili, onion, ginger and peanuts served on miniature lettuce beds.   The Impossible Burgers as sliders come cooked medium, and visually I was pleasantly stunned. The sliders looked and mimicked the moisture/visual texture real hamburger meat portrays. They were extremely tasty, and the texture had a snap/bite similar to hamburger meat. The coloring and flavor profile were extremely accurate, and the combination of flavors on top of the sliders made the entire dish phenomenal. We decided to take the third slider off the bun, and removed all the toppings to see how the patty would taste stand alone. Though you would not be blinded into thinking it was hamburger meat, it had a completely unique flavor profile unlike soy/typical vegan alternatives. The patty was a somewhat sweeter version of hamburger meat, without the fattiness/iron profile within the mouth-feel you get in a traditional hamburger meat patty.  The Thai Crispy Rice Cups came second, and did not disappoint! This dish could make me vegan! SO DELICIOUS. It was crunchy and savory with wonderful umami flavor. We ate the dish in its entirety before realizing we should have dissected a cup to taste the meat stand-alone again. These beat out any meat-based lettuce cups I have had prior, and stood mountains over the tempeh versions I have had in previous locations as a vegan alternative.   As entrees we decided on the Five Spice Garlic Lobster Tempura, and the Vegetable Crispy Pan Fried Noodles. The Five Spice Garlic Lobster Tempura was freshly breaded, and you could taste how fresh the lobster was. It lacked proper sauce and was lackluster compared to the All-Star vegan appetizers. The lobster was so fresh that we did rip off the additional tempura breading to consume all the delicious meat. The dish would benefit with a dipping sauce or additional vegetables to accompany.   Next came the Vegetable Crispy Pan Fried Noodles. These were a huge portion, and the noodles left on top of the dish were perfectly crispy. The dish was over-sauced causing the majority of the noodles to be very soggy versus suggestively crispy.The sauce had a great savory flavor profile, just excessively sauced for my liking. I would order this dish with the sauce on the side to maximize the enjoyment.   Lastly came our cappuccinos, and the ultimate dessert. I am still dreaming about this dessert, it was that good! The Mount Fiji is offered on the menu, but suggested for a much larger party (6ppl). There is also a limited Mini Mount Fiji, perfectly gluttonous for two ppl. This dessert has it all. A+ Presentation, Flavor Profile and that \"wow\" factor. Similar to a Baked Alaska, it really gets the whole room intrigued on the presentation. Showstopper, and great way to end a really delicious meal..  All I can say overall is wow! Great Experience and so excited to see where the Impossible Burger product goes in LV. Really happy this product brought us to Andrea's and showed us this restaurant is much more then just a destination for a delicious pre-club comp'd meal.   A-",

Hubby had made reservations and the hostess who took our reservation really delivered.  We got seated in one of the private booths which was perfect.   It was a Friday night, so the main dining area was pretty rowdy at 9:15pm. The music was pumping and lots of fun, but had we not been in the booth we wouldn't have been able to converse at all.   The cocktail menu is on an Ipad, so it was a interactive start to a fun evening.   Our server was really attentive, and the only issue we had was that some of our orders didn't make it to the table at the same time (the side of rice and the shumai were tardy) but everything tasted delicious!    My Miso Black Cod was SPECTACULAR.  Seriously silky and luxurious and a fairly large portion.  I was surprised that it was truly a la carte, so the described accompaniments were more garnish than side.  We ordered the charred asparagus for the table - topped with lemon preserve which made it all really interesting!   Everyone loved what they ordered.   In my humble opinion, while the sushi was excellent  and of superior quality, if you can get amazing sushi locally for less dinero (as we can at Azuki and Sushi Ota) then I'd recommend you order the Black Cod - something you cannot find everywhere.  It was to die for!  Dessert was whimsical:  we ordered the ice cream minis - such clean flavors.  My fave was the white chocolate cardamon.",

When we arrived, we were given a choice between a table in the dining room or an enclosed booth for two. The restaurant is GORGEOUS, so it really was a hard decision to make...but since it was date night, we opted for the private booth and that turned out to be a real treat! The vegan options were incredible. I opted for the Ginger Kabocha Gyoza for my appetizer, the Impossible Burger Sliders for my meal, and the Crispy Brussel Sprouts on the side. All of them were absolutely incredible, but a special shout out to the Impossible Burger Sliders. They were the most meat like burger I've ever had. Excellent texture and flavor! My partner had the Braised Pork Belly and has been raving about it for days.  This was, by far, the best meal I've ever had in Las Vegas as a vegan...and, quite possibly, the best restaurant date my partner and I have had!",

Once inside the restaurant it overlooks the pool at Surrender night club. They describe the restaurant as combining dining and nightlife which it absolutely does. No I didn't feel like I was \"raging\" at a club while eating but it had a great vibe to get you in the mood for the evening.   We got here late, around 10 pm, and for having a large group our service was incredible. Sat down and ordered a plethora of food. Started with one of the punch bowls and the truffled edamame-which is as amazing as it sounds. We then ordered food family style. The salad with crispy onion strings, the cucumber avocado sushi and a chicken dish. We finished with the signature cake pops. Out of the butter pecan, chocolate, key lime and pumpkin spice the only one I like was the buttered pecan. Cute in theory but not awesome.   In recap, Andreas has amazing food and service and while being chic and sophisticated!",

Bathroom was clean and had an attendant.  The shrimp tempura ($14) and soft-shell crab ($16) sushi rolls were very tasty; I would order sushi over the listed appetizers (or \"Table Shares\").  Sushi rolls are lovely and nicely-portioned so you get a better bang for your buck.  The miso black cod ($36) was a solid choice, as was the braised pork belly ($32).  The pork belly was deceptively light and not at all greasy.  The listed sides (e.g., smoked bacon fried rice) did not appear appealing and sounded incredibly fatty.  For dessert the mochi sampler was relatively light, particularly compared to the peanut butter brittle.  I would get the mochi to share as they come in several flavors (red bean, green tea, mango, and vanilla).  Drinks are expensive and may be watered-down, depending on which you order.  Skip the Moscow Mule.  RECOMMENDED.",

We ordered drinks and asked the waiter about the discount. He went and spoke with his manager.   Manager came and said he wasn't familiar with the discount. He asked to see the special on our phone and so we showed it to him. He said that he wasn't familiar with it again and then went to speak with someone else.   He came back and reluctantly said that they would honor the 30% discount. We ate and paid and left.   Afterwards, I reviewed the receipt and noticed that they had only given us a 15% discount. I called the restaurant and informed them about the situation. The manager said he would call me back but he never did. I also noticed that they had removed the special on Yelp.   I contacted my credit card merchant and the merchant said that they couldn't do anything since the restaurant had removed the special from the Yelp site.   I hope that the restaurant is happy that they received a 1 star review because they would not honor the additional $24.90 legitimate Yelp discount.",

I will have dinner here every twice I am in Vegas (which is three to four times a year). The first time I went, I asked the waiter for recommendations. Our group had a mix of share plates including the a Hamachi sashimi and Tuna + Crispy Rice to start, Waygu Tataki (served by the oz.), crab fried rice, and wok lobster. Just amazing.  Mochi Balls are fantastic for dessert. I will usually change up the drink order - last time I had a Green Tea Martini which was superb and appropriately Asian inspired.   if you are looking a great, social dinner with friends, work colleagues, couples or just your spouse - Andrea's is a must visit place.  Excellent assistance with Saki as well",

We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party this past weekend, and selected Andrea's as our restaurant of choice for our last night out on Saturday and are so glad we did.  We were seated immediately (party of 10), and immediately helped by Adam who stayed with us throughout the entire meal (3 hours).  As this was our first time to Andrea's, we left it to Adam to select the dishes we should try - and did he rise above our expectations - as did the food!   For starters, we had the sliders, shrimp, sashimi, and waygu tartare.  If you get nothing else - order the waygu tartare.  It will absolutely change your life.  For mains, Adam brought us lobster, waygu filet mignon (thinly sliced on cast iron), sea bass (my favorite), fried rice, and more sushi.  The brussel sprouts were excellent as well.  Dessert was also incredible and very unique.  We had a sampling of their ice creams (japanese style) as well as the marshmallow/chocolate cake mocha tower which they pour several liquors over and light on fire.  It almost as impressive as it is delicious.    We selected our own wines for the evening, but Adam and those helping him made sure our glasses were never empty!  I truly cannot wait to come back to this restaurant in my next trip to Vegas - definitely a MUST whenever you are in town for a True dining experience!",

My wife had the California roll for a starter and the Scallops for her main course. She still raves about how good they were.   The service was excellent and the food was even better!

I don't know what is up with these interior designers in Las Vegas but they select the WORST chairs for a luxurious restaurants. Their taste in chairs is in their mouth!

    "text": "My friend raves about Andrea's. She said the food was fantastic and the service was excellent but I didn't experience it. I was incredibly disappointed with the poor service.   We didn't have a reservation and there were many open tables but it took us 20 minutes to be seated. A lot of the empty tables had \"reserved\" signs on the tables but no one sat down to eat or drink from these tables while we waited for a table and while we wait (keep in mind we were still eating after the restaurant closed because the serving of dishes were poorly timed).   Food: excellent and the only reason I gave Andrea's 2 stars. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the miso fish was incredibly flavorful.   Service: awful. Our dinner was poorly timed. We waited 20 minutes between our oyster appetizers and seafood main dishes. Yes, we timed it because it was such a long wait. No water service or update of our meal by or server. The wait staff are hardworking and hustled to help patrons but they didn't pay much attention to us. I totally felt judged. I didn't dress as nicely as others but I went to Vegas for gambling not dining. My money is just as green as other guests. Luckily we ordered drinks at the bar and brought it to our table because it took a while for our server to offer beverages including water. My friend apologized for the poor service saying it was better the first time she ate there. Generally, the service at the Wynn is good so it was surprising to have such poor service in their restaurant.   Price: expensive. I would be ok with it if the service was as excellent as the food but it was not. Our meal had very low value given quality of food and service.   Location: near the slot machines in the Encore. It was beautifully designed and the decor was stunning which was the other reason I gave the restaurant 2 stars.   Overall, I would NOT come back here nor would I recommend Andrea's given the many choices one has in Vegas. Don't waste your time or money. You can go to Jardin or Costi di Mari in the Wynn/Encore for a better meal and service.",

    "text": "This was truly next level stuff! I was expecting great food and service when coming to Vegas, yet this place not only met but exceeded my expectations. Sure, not everything was perfect, but that which was more than made up for it.   Everything, starting with the food and ending with the service was on point. They pulled out all the stops, which was especially surprising considering I was here on the package including a ticket to Le Reve (review coming soon). This package included everything, even gratuities!  P.S. If you want to see Le Reve, call for the package, it is absolutely worth it.  In terms of flavors, I have to once again reference B.B. King. I am told the man could play three notes that could bring you to tears. This is the case here: dishes are small and uncomplicated, but they play just the right notes to make your taste buds sing.   I can't remember too many specifics, but here is what I do remember:  + Salmon Sashimi - Quality of the fish was amazing. Fish is a delicate animal. Sauces and marinades can greatly enhance the flavor, but it is incredibly easy to overdo it. This is what I especially liked about this is that it wasn't drenched in sauce. You had the option to try the salmon in pure form and spread the sauce as you wanted. The little touch of green was also nice, especially for me, as a person who is always screaming about balance.   + Hamachi - Even though the fish lays on a small bed of sauce, I did not find it too overwhelming. However, in fairness, I must say I found the flavor a little astringent. The flavors were there, certainly, but they didn't really work for me. Also, what's with the peanut? it seems a little extra in my opinion.  + Five Spice Calamari - I really liked the different interpretation of this dish. All the calamari I've had previously was breaded and fried. Here, it was far purer. However, this dish was a little too delicate for my taste. The flavors of the calamari and greens were allowed to shine, but I found myself asking what these five spices were. A pinch more spice and spritz more sauce/dressing would have done this dish wonders.   + Miso Black Cod - Now back to things I enjoyed more! Unfortunately, this is also where my memory becomes a little more imperfect. Everything in this dish went well, the flavors, marinades, and combination of textures. My only critique is the rather large leaves of bibb lettuce. I'm just personally not a fan of large leaves in a dish.  + Pork Belly Poutine - I've had pork belly prepared two ways before here. I've had them fried (seasoned with S&P only) and braised in all sorts of sauces. Frying/grilling gives a nice crispness to the dish, whereas braising makes it much softer and more delicate. Here, you had the best of both worlds. It has some of that crispness but at the same time that delicate flavor of braising. The poutine was also extremely delicate and flavorful, as was the sauce!  Bravo! When I return to Vegas, I'll happily bring a decent chunk of my paycheck to eat from the regular menu.",

She told me about these tables are just for reservation so I guess walking guests aren't welcomed here. The receptionist lady has very bad customer service. We chose to sit at the bar because I still wanted to try out the foods for its pictures on Yelp. It was a very good decision when I decided to stay because the foods are very good with my order of crispy noodle & beef slider. We got excellent service at the bar area too. Until we finished our meal, there were plenty of opened tables & they were empty the entire time.",

The menu has just about everything so there is lots to choose from.  Some of my favorites are their hamachi sashimi, albacore sashimi, miso black cod (literally melts in your mouth), and so much more!  They have a great house salad and amazing sides as well! I love their twice green beans and their shoe string potatoes   I would recommend getting there after the day club has closed because of you go around 6-6:30 they are still rounding up the drunk kiddos and it can be distracting or it can be a show (up to you lol). They have these booths on the left side when you walk in that are fabulous and very romantic! So make sure to ask for those!",

It was more crowded than I thought around 8pm for a Sunday, but there was a huge conference going on so that could have played into it. I started with the edamame and hamachi crudo appetizers. The edamame was no different than your usual - steamed and salted. It was a huge portion! The hamachi crudo was delicious and very fresh. This was definitely my favorite dish. I then got a vegetarian noodle dish as an entree. Unfortunately, this winded up being oily and upsetting my stomach. If I was going back, I probably would order a sushi roll as they looked delicious!   I do feel like it was overpriced, but then again you are in a hotel on the strip in Vegas so can't expect much else.",

Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and gracious to assist! I had the Asian Pear cocktail, hubby had the old fashioned and both were fantastic. Asian Pear is a little sweet for me to have more than one so my server suggested a cross between the Asian Pear and Cosmopolitan, which was very good.   For our meals I ordered the Thai green curry off the vegetarian menu but added real chicken breasts to it (OMG. AMAZING!) the chicken was so moist and flavorful, the curry was amazing. I am still salivating over it! My husband ordered the pan fried noodle with pork and really enjoyed it too. There's no really spicy meals here per the server, but they have a house-made sriracha if you want more spice and it was great! I will absolutely be back on our next visit and every visit thereafter, it was that good.",

    "text": "My friend is obsessed with the Mt. Fuji dessert so we came in with a few friends just to get a couple of them! Mt. Fuji is a flaming chocolate, marshmallowy dessert that's definitely worth getting. I really enjoyed the dessert, but did not enjoy my dining experience at all.   First, it was a slow Sunday night, there was barely anyone in the main dining area and the service was bad. They were super slow, they were not attentive and not helpful. I know didn't order food and just dessert, but that doesn't mean we should get bad service.   Second, one of our friends is allergic to gluten. She is not on this gluten free diet thing, she literally has celiac disease so we asked the waiter for some gluten free dessert options. He told us there were a few and raddled off this berry cake first! it sounded good to us so we just went for it. Our friend had a taste first and said she didnt really like it so a couple of us had a try and it was BAD! probably one of the worst cakes I've ever tasted! It was not only dry but had horrible flavor, it tasted like cardboard. We maybe eat one third of it and left it. We told the waiter about it and he barely apologized. When the bill came they didnt even take it off. A restaurant of this caliber I would expect for it to be off. It would be one thing if we had eaten most of it, but it was barely touched. This isn't even the worst part though! This dessert was NOT gluten free!!!!!!!! The waiter misinformed us! It was vegan, which is much different than gluten free so my friend got super sick!!! She was throwing up later that night, had migraines and had to call in sick to work the next day!! Its one thing to make a bad dessert but its another thing to give misinformation that can be harmful!!!   There are so many choices of restaurants in Vegas and I would expect more from a place like this. Mt. Fuji is delicious but I just cant recommend people to come here because of the mishaps we had.",

We had no idea that it would be so fancy!  I ordered the edamame with truffle salt. Honestly, I could not taste the truffle salt, and my colleague, who considers herself a great lover of truffle salt, could not taste it either. It was still delicious. Once my main course of two vegetable rolls and one avocado + asparagus roll arrived, I was in vegan sushi heaven. Not only was the presentation gorgeous, but the sushi was absolutely delicious. The vegetables were super fresh, I almost felt like I was eating a fresh salad in sushi form. After I finished my rolls, I ordered another vegetable roll as my \"dessert\" while my colleague had actual dessert.  Not only was the food incredible, but the service was the most on point that I have ever experienced. We received such attentive service, from our water being refilled, to an individual solely in charge of leading diners to the restroom. Along with the overall simplistic elegance, beauty, and cleanliness of the restaurant, this was the highlight of our trip and the best dining experience of my life.",

    "text": "Somewhat underwhelming.  The suhito peppers were fantastic.  The environment is clearly one of upscale dining.  They have some private-ish rooms for celebrties i'm sure.  I went on a night where they didn't have a DJ, so the experience might be different at the supperclubs.  I would like to see a little more bang for the buck.  The staff was very courteous and professional, but still the food was underwhelming and I think it may be unfair but i've come to expect so much from the restaurants at the Wynn/Encore properties.  The again do have a vegeterian menu, but it was underwhelming in inspiration of entrees.  Hopefully if the menu continuously changes they can keep it fresh.  I will still return to check out the supperclub aspect as surrender is easily my favorite club.  That was another thing I liked, the view.  It was a nice sexy backdrop for a meal.  But as a resto I would say u could fare much better at another spot in the wynn.",

We had the sliders which were juicy and meat cooked perfectly. The rock shrimp were to die for with a sweet and sour taste. We tried the duck Lo mein and the scallop garlic noodles. The garlic noodles were better. The duck Lo mein had a bit too much sesame oil which made it a tad bitter. We also order the miso cod which is always wonderful anytime we order it from an Asian fusion restaurant. Andreas didn't disappoint. Lastly we had a soft shell crab roll and a rainbow roll which was fresh and great too, but we were too full to fully appreciate the rolls. We had 4 cocktails and our bill totaled $384, of which $70 was the tip. I look forward to coming here again soon.",

    "text": "The food was okay, but it was SO overpriced.  Beware of the 75 food credit given by Wynn to entice you into coming in here.  We ended up paying $400 for super tiny portions.  We ordered potatoes and lo mein noodles to share.  It was sad how tiny the lo mein was and was not any better than a small Chinese place that's on every corner of LA.  I was disappointed that I ended up spending so much money for so little food.  We were still hungry after we left. They didn't get our steak right either.  We ordered 3 filet mignon, two medium rare and one medium well.  My friend's medium well was a well done, totally cooked through, my husband's medium rare was medium well and mine was medium rare how I wanted it.  My husband hates anything over medium rare so i switched my steak with his because I don't mind too much, but at 50 bucks a steak you should be getting that right, no?  I'm not a cheap person I just felt kind of bamboozled into this and it may be partially my fault for not looking into the prices but the woman on the phone was pushing Andrea's so much and that I should make a reservation that I just did it not thinking it would be so expensive for so little.  I'm on vacation I don't mind splurging...but we want decent portions. And as for the 'asian fusion\" this was hardly that.  Putting an itty bitty tiny salad with some ginger sauce does not make asian fusion in my opinion.  You could either order american or asian dishes, not much fusion going on, but maybe I haven't gone to enough fusiony places to know better, lol.  We made the joke of the fact that if you put the word \"fusion\" in a restaurant name/description that automatically bumps you up in a dollar sign.",

We were there for over 3 hours just dining and drinking. Mood our server was so friendly and knowledgeable. They are exceptional at watching the table at Andrea's which I adore, that's one of the most important aspects of good service in dining. They have great wines by the glass and PJ by the glass which is rarer, I'm a champagne addict.   I prefer the food next door at Sinatra over the food at Andrea's, but the food was still very good. However, the food was not perfection in every dish which is what brought my rating down to 4 stars. The sauce on the scallops was too fishy for me and I wasn't a fan of the wagyu lobster sushi roll. I love foie gras though and I will always order it it if it's on a menu, and the foie gras here was possibly the best I've had in town. Also, my favorite sushi is fresh uni with a quail egg and two salmon roe - try it, you won't regret it! It was very good here, the sushi quality was good.",

They went above and beyond by offering the children kid-friendly meals and my 86 yr old grandmother something she's familiar to. Since we had a large party, they suggested doing family style with the chef's choice for everyone else so we could sample a bit of everything on their menu.  The flavoring of the food here is exceptional!! The sushi and seafood plate with caviar were particularly outstanding because of the quality. Seafood was very fresh compared to places like the Bacchanal (which we had the night before). For dessert, they brought us 12 different flavors of hand crafted ice cream! All of them were deliciousss and really unique (Sake Cherry, Jalapeno chocolate, etc). Overall it was a really memorable dinner!",

Pros: - I've been to Andreas several times for the Cosmopolitan Connections group and love the ambiance - The poolside view right outside of Andreas is amazing (feel like I'm in a music video or something)  Cons: - It's a little hard to get to if you've never been there before. You have to walk through the hotel (smells like smoke) to get to Andreas. I always feel like plugging my nose every time I'm on my way to here - They charge more for their food (I guess you can expect that for this type of place)  Final Verdict: Andreas offers a great location for groups or couples and has a great upscale feel to it.",

    "text": "As a part-time local in Las Vegas I and my brother Dan ate in this restaurant about a dozen times since January, bringing friends as guests because I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian menu has quite a few offerings- especially the meatless burger known as the Impossible Burger. Saturday night, May 13, 2018, having made a reservation many weeks before for 6:00 PM when the restaurant officially opens for dinner. That night I had a reservation for two. I checked in with the greeter at 5:58 PM and she said it would be a minute or two before the restaurant opened. A few minutes later a group of eight came in after me and they were immediately seated. Then a group of four came in and were immediately seated even though they told the greeter they had a reservation for 6 :30 and would rather eat at 6:00OPM. Then another group of six who came in after me were seated. Still there were the other thirty plus tables open and my brother and I were not seated.  I went over to the greeter and asked if there was a problem and it was ten minutes after my reservation and I and my brother were still not seated. At first she, a thin young lady ignored me like she was thinking about something and after about 40 seconds she looked up and said there was no problem as the people who came in after me had \"registered\" before me even though I arrived on time for my scheduled reservation and most of the restaurant tables were left open. The greeter should be disciplined for when she still had not seated me by two minutes later my brother and I walked out and went to another restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. Andrea's has lost a good local customer as I and my brother Dan will never ever return to this restaurant because of their poor customer service. They have lost a frequent customer. Suggest you never go to this restaurant because of the idiot greeter. Employing someone like that indicates very poor management from the top who cares not one wit about their customers as they believe there is an endless supply of tourists coming to Las Vegas.  Still debating whether to call the Encore Hotel general manager to let him know how poor is the customer service at one of their supposedly erestaurant though I doubt that the hotel really cares.",

We ordered their signature dish...the five spice lobster tempura for $58...and it was probably the worse lobster dish I ever ate at an Asian restaurant.  Their chicken adobo entree was extremely salty so I would avoid this one too.  The crab fried rice was good and my kids said the california roll and philadelphia rolls were the best tasting ones they ate.  I ordered the three sashimi chef sampler appetizer for $44 and thought it was just ok tasting.  The sashimi was sliced so thin like shabushabu meat which I found quite annoying considering the high price tag.  Overall I am not eatting here again.  I wish i could have tried their Mt Fuji dessert but the regular food here sucked to be honest for a top restaurant in Encore.",

I chose the sea bass and it was moist and flavorful.  My hubby ordered the black cod and it was also delicious. BUT... I thought the prices were outrageous. The dish was $40 a la carte. Sides were over $10. The cocktails were $16.   We presented our server with a Yelp offer for 30% off drinks for locals, but they did not take it off our bill. Even after asking about it, the server insisted it had been removed but it was not noted on the receipt nor did the figures add up to any discount. In addition, they charged our party a special fee for the group. Plus the expected automatic 18% gratuity.   Normally, I tip well for decent service but the service at this place was horrible, especially considering all these fees they charged us. It took our server 15 minutes to bring our cocktails. When we were ready for the check, it took 20 minutes for them to bring it. The servers were hardly around nor did they check on the table much.   Even though the food was good, I would not recommend this place to anyone based on poor service. Looking at other reviews, I am not alone in this experience.",

We shared five dishes, including Duck panang, charred asparagus, shrimp pad Thai (wrapped in a unique crepe-like egg), spicy tuna roll and soft shell crab roll.   Most everything had delicious flavor and the dishes were actually much larger than I expected.  Certainly worth a stop when you are in town.",

I didn't have drinks, but what the bartender was churning out all looked delicious. Will definitely come here every chance I get. Highly recommend the place if you're vegan/vegetarian. Tons of options. Wynn is known to have a vegan and vegetarian menu on hand at each restaurant, which makes their restaurants excellent choices when accommodating dietary preferences.",

Last minute dinner reservations at any decent restaurant on the strip is extremely difficult, but luckily, Andrea's was able to accommodate our party of 6.  Located in the Encore, Andrea's  decor has young, vibrant feel to the establishment. We sat near the entry and had a good time watching the pre-club crowds show up in their scantily clad outfits. Trendy music played over the speakers as we dined which kept everyone alert and carefree.  The Food? DELICIOUS!  A friend and I ordered the Saikyo Miso Black Cod based on the suggestion of our server and OMG..the cod almost melted in your mouth. Combined with the miso and the hint of lemon, it was a flavor combination out of this world.  A few colleagues ordered the wok seared beef tenderloin and raved over their dish as well. It's a hefty portion of meat, so only order if you're really hungry (or if you have a microwave in your room), chances are you won't finish it.  Drinks are super expensive, ranging from $15 - $22. I ordered \"The Dream\" cocktail and wowza, it was yummy! I will definitely add Andreas to my list of recommended Vegas restaurants.",

Started with a chef-gifted amuse bouche of salmon tartar in a cucumber-dill reduction.  Tasty!   Gael had the oyster app and declared  them the best she ever tasted. I had the foie gras (of course) and it was among the best ever.  Entrees were the scallops for my bride and five-spice lobster tempura for me.  Lioco Chard for her and Tsing Tao beer for me.  The staff heard (somehow) that it was our anniversary and comped us nifty little \"cake pops\" for dessert.  Pricey? Yes, but it's Vegas, right?  A wonderful experience all around.",

Not at all worth it, actually it was a joke and I felt screwed out of my money.  The appetizers were seasoned green peppers and edamame... For 9 people we got two small bowls as you would if you were a couple on a date at a sushi restaurant.   For the second round it was a salad plate I promise you enough for two bites per girl in our party. Oh and the sushi?? LOL one roll of avocado and asparagus roll and another of spicy tuna that tasted old -- AVOCADO AND ASPARAGUS REALLY? As if I went to Vons and grabbed a ready made sushi plate .  Main course you ask??? Salmon (delicious) or Chicken (dried and disgustingly salty) but that was it! Just a piece of salmon or chicken nothing else on the plate.  Dessert- Cake pops.... Really? Whatever   Oh and the atmosphere? Felt like an overcrowded cafeteria, waiters kept hitting my chair no matter how much I pushed myself in. And no I'm not a chubby girl so I was pretty annoyed.  Did nothing special for a bachelorette either so I don't know what the point of it was.  Never again! Sushi Samba in Vegas is MUCH BETTER!  CHERRY ON TOP!!!! They kept taking our plates away WHILE WE WERE STILL TRYING TO ENJOY THEM. We had a few sushi pieces left and they came and grabbed them LIKE OK???? Seriously!? Lmao at least ask if we're done.",

Like many fusion restaurants, they do sushi right: every roll was beautiful and delicious, the hamachi and jalapeno app was fresh, etc.  Where Andrea's shines is off the sushi menu. And I regret that our group focused more on sushi. I most certainly will go back and explore deeper into the menu, including the fois gras bao buns - they are calling my name.  I did appreciate the personalized birthday chopsticks.",

I ordered a dish that's been discontinued, although they should bring it back, it's the best- snap peas, pear and cloud ear. The server was great and asked the kitchen to made it for me anyway, which they did. It was fantastic!  The Seabass.... Oh no. This was terrible. I've never had bad food here, but this was a little pile of rubber. I didn't even eat it. Instead, I indulged in the gluten free fried rice which was really good.  Wine: Always fantastic, a good menu, the somm was attentive and put it on ice. Surprisingly that's a tough request in some restaurants, but not here. Always top notch wine service and selection.  Ambiance: We had a private little booth on the side. Always a sexy atmosphere whether in the middle of the room or in a booth.  This wasn't a bad experience but it's usually much better. Recommended for Celiacs though!",

This is my all-time favorite restaurant for vegan cuisine in Las Vegas. We always try to make a stop here when we're in town. The ambiance is chic and elevated. It's located inside Encore.   My favorite items here are the Impossible Sliders and spicy tofu roll from their vegan menu. The sliders have an amazing slaw with special sauce that gives the burger its umami flavor and the impossible patty is grilled to crispy perfection. The spicy tofu roll has a great balance of texture with avocado, mushroom tempura, and spicy mayo. We also got the special vegan cucumber roll but the spicy tofu really outshined it.   I ordered the slow poached prawn but found this quite disappointing. It tasted like a large shrimp, nothing special. Prawns are usually sweeter and crisper than your average shrimp.   Sadly we found out on our last visit that Andreas is closing in 2 months and will be replaced by a new concept serving Mexican fare. We're going to try to get in another visit before it closes.",

DONT GO HERE IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HIGH QUALITY SUSHI THIS IS  NOT THE PLACE TRUST ME! it shouldnt be rated a five star for sure....more like a 2-3 star....your better of going to Nobu sushi instead about same price but way better service and food is high quality!!! we eat sushi alot and this place was horrible!!! we are locals and decided to have a stay cation at the encore, this place had some good reviews so we figured it would be very good and it wasnt!!! so last night we came here for dinner around 9:15pm to pick up a few rolls to go to take back to our room to enjoy while watching a movie on netflix ;-) wow how we wish we didnt!   First, we ordered only 5 rolls and we WAITED  for 45 mins after waiter said it will only take about 20 mins. not to mention the place only had 4-5 tables to serve it wasnt packed at all. with maybe 10 waiters and 4-5 sushi chefs! the manager was walking around and saw us there waiting and didnt say a word! after waiting almost an hour a waiter named Armando brought our bag to us, he apologized for the wait and checked the bags to make sure everything was good and made sure we got enough soy sauce and chops sticks. he was very nice and helpful besides the annoying wait we had to go through!!   Then, When we got to our room and took our plates out & we were in shock to find our sushi rolls super tiny and nothing the way sushi rolls from a fine dinning restaurant    should look, they literally looked like sushi you get from the market for like $5 lol let me say we paid $120 for 5 rolls and we were starved after :-( our rolls barely had any fish on them. we would be ok to pay top dollar for sushi as long as its worth it and in this case it totally was a rip off!!! Our salmon roll had the thinest slices of salmon on top i have ever seen.... Each roll was about $25 you would expect the best of the best but no way!!! truly a disappointment....we've been to many fine dining sushi spots in town and out of town and never have seen anything like this before! for example, Nobu is about the same price but there quality and serving sizes are generous and worth the $$$$!!! The rolls didn't taste that good and fish wasn't as fresh as it should have been!  I highly recommend you DONT GO HERE for sushi! yes the decor and ambiance will make you think differ... its beautiful inside but the food and service isn't good at all! about an hour for 5 rolls imagine if we dined in our dinner would take all night lol  The management , quality, quantity and sushi chefs  need much improvement! sorry \"Andreas\" i will never return here during my stay nor just a night out for dinner and  i will be sure to let friends and family know not to go here as well :-(",

Nice piece of tuna on a little bit of crispy rice - definitely worth trying out.  Rock shrimp tempura and salmon sashimi rounded out our apps.  Everything was awesome!  We ordered the porterhouse for 2 as an entree.  They offer a wasabi demi glaze as a preparation option.  I could've done without it but the steak was tender and cooked perfectly - medium rare.  We added a side of charred asparagus to the steak.  A really nice option in the Wynn!",

The body itself is raw but the dish comes with the head which is deep fried and also edible.  The Jidori chicken breast is juicy despite coming from the breast.  The sauce adds extra flavor to it but the chicken itself is moist and does fine without it.  The avocado ice cream is ok, similar to an avocado shake.  Black sesame ice cream is amazing, and what surprised me the most was how good the waffle was!  We saw the chef come out to greet couple of customers which was nice to see.",

    "text": "What caught my eye about Andrea's is definitely the interior of the restaurant. It's chic and lounge-y and honestly the words Asian and Fusion together never bode too well with me but it was hard to say no when all the reviews were so positive.  We made a reservation for 2 on a Thursday night at 9 PM (We really didn't need one because half the restaurant was empty at this point). We were seated within minutes.   Our server was really helpful and attentive without being overbearing. He went through the menu with us since it was our first time and recommended us dishes to try.   We opted for:  Tuna + Crispy Rice (5/5): This was the chef's take on sushi which we found extremely delicious. The tuna had great flavor and the sauces were not overwhelming and had the perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness. The crispy rice paired extremely well with the fish (Think the rice at the bottom of a hot bibimbap). The contrast of the crunchiness went really well with the butteriness of the fish.  Diver Sea Scallops (4/5): The scallops were cooked perfectly and not tough at all. The lemongrass and cilantro flavors went well with it and the squid ink fried rice wasn't too salty and paired well with the scallops. The flavors didn't wow us but it was still pleasant and enjoyable.  Crispy Pan Fried Noodles (4/5): I'm a sucker for deep fried noodles drizzled in sauce so I had to get this when I saw it on the menu! We chose shrimp as our protein and I think we made the right choice. The saucy stir fry aired on the sweet side but still had great flavor and I think it was an interesting take on such a classic HK dish./  The dining experience was really comfortable and enjoyable and the food was also great. You're definitely paying for the ambiance and the location but I think the food is good enough so you don't feel so bad about the priciness. Definitely recommend!",

One of the best meals we have ever had with  service to match.  The meal started with a surprise, 2 small 'palate cleansers' which set the tone.  We probably could have eaten several dozen they were so good.   Our first appetizer was cucumber salad, not one of our servers recommendations.   It was good, but nothing special.  Things improved exponentially from there.  Next appetizer was an off menu item, vegetarian faux nagi which was beautifully seasoned, absolutely delicious.    The mains were Thai Cups and Basil 'Beef' made with impossible burger.  The Thai Cups were slightly spicy, and the impossible burger in the 'beef' did not look like burger, somehow it had the consistency of thinly sliced beef.  As an side we had another off menu dish, Brussel Sprouts.  Although this was too much food for the two of us, it was all so good it was difficult to stop eating...and we didn't, moving on to dessert.  For desert, a lemon berry cake which maintained the standards set by appetizers and mains, absolutely delicious.  We had beers from a very nice list of options which worked well with what we ordered.  The downside?  Apparently the restaurant is closing in August to make way for some celebrity chef (really?) to serve over-hyped food to adoring masses.",

Been coming here with my parents every time we're in Vegas.. and finally this time on June 8th of 2019 I got to take my boyfriend out to Andreas for his 24th bday. What I love about this place is they have PLENTY of vegan options like MUCHOS. And in Vegas on the strip it's really hard to find a Nice , boujee type of restaurant that carries a lot of vegan selections however Andreas has changed the game. It's not even like 2 -3 dishes this place has a WHOLE MENU list of vegan options! While I get to enjoy my steak :'). My server I wish I knew his name but he was OUTSTANDING. I believe ALL workers at Andreas are trained so well , they definitely know the TRUE definition of quality customer service. I had their filet Mignon, my boyfriend had the avocado asparagus roll (it's 11$ I know but hey it's vegas) , Brussels sprouts, vegan chow fun, house salad and miso soup. And everything we ordered was top notch! For two of us the bill was 188 plus tip it was 228 but it was DEFINITELY WORTH every $$$$. This is definitely a high end place so don't come here expecting to find cheap eats... this ain't no Local diner or sushi bar. So definitely come prepare with them cash... or cards haha. Also if u request before they do special customized chopsticks for special occasions :) they did one for my boyfriend. Thank you Andreas you guys are awesome and can't wait to come back to Vegas and done with you guys! This place treats you with respect and great quality service! Come!!!",

Turns out that taking an 'early' dinner on a Friday night was an excellent idea.  By the time we left, the place was packed and people were waiting in line just to see the hostess. The service was amazing.  We've come to expect a higher caliber of service in LV, and Andrea's is no exception.  We had a team of people assigned to our table, catering to our every whim. The food was outstanding as well.  I can personally vouch for the sushi - which was some of the best I've ever experienced.  The other guests at the table had rave reviews for the scallops and vegetable dishes as well. In my book the music was a touch on the loud side (I never thought those words would ever come out of my mouth), but I suppose that is just what happens at a trendy nightclub-esque restaurant on a Friday night. Overall, it was a great experience!",

Service was very attentive and our server was clearly well schooled in \"foodie speak\" to make sure we got as much information as possible on the menu items.  Well worth a trip to the Wynn if you are not staying there (we did not on this trip but plan to in the future).  Price is on the high end, even for Vegas so be prepared for that!",

I had the Red Velvet Martini and it was so delish, I dream about it. The waiter was super nice and gave us chopsticks that said Happy Anniversary:) Everything we ordered was superb, sushi, rice, steak, etc. Cool vibe, we were told if we came back later we could get into the club for free. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas. I'm counting the days. Please don't complain about the piece, you are in Vegas, in the Wynn and on vacation. Live it up!",

    "text": "My friends and I went to Andrea's last night, for the first time. We made a 10pm reservation, since we planned on heading to Surrender right after. We got there a little early, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. If you have a group, I totally recommend the punch bowls....they have about 4 different flavors and are great for sharing (you can get them with glasses to pour individual drinks or these really long straws so everyone can drink from the bowl in the center of the table)!  We ordered our food family style so everyone could try different things. Since, we are locals, we usually go to Kabuto or Haikado for sushi, but the wagyu beef and lobster roll at Andrea's is something that I haven't seen at our local spots! We also had the special cucumber roll, rock shrimp tempura, wagyu beef sliders, a seafood platter, a crispy noodle dish with chicken, and the New York Strip! We told out server that we were ordering for the table, so he was really awesome in helping us select dishes that were easy for us to share! We finished with a tower of 12 mini ice cream cones, which drew a lot of attention when it was being brought through the dining room!  Our server and the guy assisting him were extremely attentive and patient with us. They were really nice and we never had to wait for any anything.   Andrea's is setting a cool trend with their atmosphere! The lights were dim, the DJ was playing, and everyone in the place was having a great time! It's the perfect place to styart the night before heading out......and who knows who you might see.....Eric Prydz was performing at Surrender last night....and he was eating 2 tables over from us!!!",

When I checked in on Yelp it gave a 30% off on the cocktails for locals, but surely the manager accommodated us with the 30% off on all the cocktails we had. I can say they were very nice and tasty.",

Always pushing wine and drinks. Also We were there for my girl friends birthday. And we asked the waiter if he has any special desert or song or something for birthdays . He comes back with a boozy desert. We enjoyed it sang happy birthday , and then when we got the bill the desert was $48!!!  $50 bucks for a desert? When I looked at the desert menu most deserts where $10 $12, so why was it $48. We all left feeling taken and unhappy . At least tell us the price or bring one of the $12 deserts with a candle .",

Wagyu sliders were amazing, but the bread kind of threw me off. They used a sweet doughy hamburger bun rather than a brioche bun. The sushi rolls were good. I regret not getting the pad thai and the crab fried rice. Dessert was delish and well presented. The five stars is due to the stunning decor, chic ambiance, cocktails galore, superb service, and delectable food. Will definitely return and recommend.",

There's a DJ spinning chill tunes and lots of pretty people working and eating there. We had reservations for two at 8:00 and were seated promptly.  The service was attentive and friendly.  We ordered 2 Dim Sum apps: chicken potstickers and shrimp dumplings which were both hot and very good but standard fare.  We picked spicy stir fry chicken and chicken with noodles for our entrees.  Both were around $25 and were only OK.  Nothing different from what you'd get for a 1/3rd of the price at your local Chinese takeout.  For dessert, we had cheesecake balls which were quite yummy.

    "text": "I was so disappointed.  Went here with a party of 9 on a Friday night.  Environment:  Andrea's is very hip.  They had a dj playing in the corner, great music.  Nicely decorated.  Music was a little loud, difficult conversation for nine.  Service:  Service was slow.  They didn't have enough menus for everyone.  I am however giving 1 star for the fact that they did separate checks which as a one time server, I know is a total pain.  Food:  Had edamame app, and smoked salmon app.  Both of these were decent.  The edamame had truffle salt, which was pretty amazing.  I had the filet for dinner was was THE WORST FILET I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!  It was awful.  It was so dry, and no flavor.  It was like beef bubble gum.  Others had the miso cod, an noodles which companions said was pretty good... but a $60 filet.. and it was horrible.. so disappointing.  The last kicker was, we had purchased tickets from the hotel concierge to go to Surrender, and the concierge also made reservations for us to go to Andreas. What they didn't mention is if you eat at Andrea's you have a direct entrance into Surrender, we didn't even need the tickets and now they won't refund.  I guess that is more of a complaint for the hotel in general - but still bad none the less.   Maybe this place would be better for drinks and apps at the bar, but I would not recommend it for dinner.",

At these prices all restaurant's should make guests feel this welcome and special. The music (DJ) was fantastic, fun and turned our evening into a great 'party' (loud enough to make us want to sing/dance; soft enough for great conversations).  The service was terrific and attentive.  The food was DELICIOUS. Sushi was excellent; shishito peppers are a MUST as are each of their rice dishes & shrimp app; desserts were equally yummy and the cocktails were perfection.

The ambiance is beautiful with the chandeliers, tables, and chairs. The windows on one side overlook the pool. Everything we had was amazing. We had a few sushi items as appetizers including the albacore sashimi with crispy onions and soup. My entree was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection. The desserts were unbelievable, we had a combination of three different ice creams and fruit with shaved ice, which was prepared at the table. The staff were very courteous and respectful.

    "text": "Like a few other reviewers, I was also there on opening night. I had no idea what to expect (my husband made reservations without knowing anything about the restaurant).  The food was good and seeing that it is a fine dining restaurant in Encore, for the prices I was actually surprised at the portions. Many of the dishes are meant to be shared and this is exactly what we did. It was plenty of food for me though my husband probably could have used one more dish ;).  We had the fried pork pot stickers, garlic noodles with scallops, the shrimp tempura roll and the fun little dessert trio.  Everything was tasty, the scallops were tender and not sandy, and you could taste the individual ingredients (nothing covered in too much sauce or oil).   The drinks were unique, really yummy and comparably priced to other Strip bars/restaurants.   I liked the vibe of the place, decked out in mostly white with a lot of high top tables, wait staff in all black, lots of space and iPads to review and order your drinks. But among all this hipness (which I typically may not like) the DJ played an interesting mix of music (70s, 80s, 90s). For me this was the exact foil needed to make sure it wasn't too hip.  The bar area was roomy and the whole place comfortable enough that I would definitely go back just to hang out and have drinks.  I gave it only 3 stars because I've had the same quality and creativeness in Asian cuisine at other establishments for much less cost. I've experienced it once, I probably won't go back for the food. But you're not just paying for the food, you are paying for the ambiance so if you're looking for that nice combo, consider it a 4 and give it a chance.",

Long story short, they didn't do anything with a party of 6 ladies (and Encore hotel guests) with nothing more than a phone number to call for a lost credit card. After I complained that they should offer to do something for wasted time (over 45 mins), inconvenience and poor customer service, the manager Lauren Boylan, did nothing. Great. You lost the only credit card that I brought to Vegas and it's apparently my problem now. Then since we had to make another set of plans and didn't want to waste any more time of my friends, we said the least they can do is comp the meal. They refused and offered nothing. So then my friend suggested it's right to at least take drinks that came out late and 1/6 of the meal. The worst customer service ever!!!!! I will never advise anyone to go there and I will be speaking to the property manager about the lack of customer service on their property.  Do better Wynn/Encore and Andrea's!!!",

We had made reservations a few weeks before and were really excited to try the new place and then go out to his birthday celebration afterwards. We had no idea we would be waiting over and hour just to be seated and ended up missing our original plans.  When we arrived for our 9:30 reservation at 9:10 we were told it would be a few minutes to get the table ready. At 9:40 my boyfriend checked back in and was once again told it would be a few more minutes to prepare the table. 30 minutes past our reservation time and almost 45 minutes of waiting I finally asked the hostess what was going on and explained this was a very special occasion and we made reservations for a reason. She told me that people were at our table and we would need to wait. Finally after an hour of waiting I told her we would be leaving if we were not seated immediately.   We finally got a table set up for us, in the bar area, not even in the actual dining area. Overall this was NOT a good experience. The food was very mediocre for the price and the service was close to the service you get at fast food but extremely slower. In the end we ended up missing the event we had planned for after dinner and my boyfriend spent his birthday night waiting an hour when we had a reservation. We essentially paid $300 to waste our night away and miss his birthday event afterwards.   My advice would be if you are going to accept reservations make sure you hold them, not make people wait an hour. They clearly have respect for their customers.  After looking at other Yelp reviews this seems to be the norm for them. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want to waste an hour of your life.",

    "text": "Overpriced and faux-luxe..  I came to Las Vegas for work and met some colleagues for dinner.  We were staying at the Wynn and wanted a restaurant on the property, so we chose this one. The restaurant is nice - upscale looking and trendy.  Unfortunately the upscale neo-luxe features are a shallow veneer.  We sat down  and waited at least 5 minutes for our server to bring menus.  She dropped them off and then vanished for 15 minutes. She came back and took appetizer orders. I also ordered a beer which took almost 30 minutes to arrive.  This was on  Tuesday night and the restaurant was far from crowded.  The whole meal suffered from inattentive service, and that includes bus boys filling water glasses and cleaning dishes.  Basically the service was terrible.  Like frustratingly bad.  Absolutely not what I expected from such an ambitiously high-end restaurant.  We sat down at 8:35pm and didn't get food until almost 10pm.  The food was ok.  Certainly not bad, but nowhere near the best sushi I have had.  We ordered hamachi appetizers and it was sliced so thin it could have been a parchment..  It was garnished with a crispy onion straight from the supermarket and dripping with some sort of flavored oil.  Not refreshing or clean tasting.  Sashimi was $30 for 3 pieces.  Way too expensive!   Rolls were between $25 and $30 and comparable to rolls costing half as much at most sushi restaurants. The food was medium quality meaning not bad, but certainly not top of the pack.  Yet the prices were easily the highest I have seen for sushi.    Most of the dishes had a heavy sugary sauce on them too.  We spent almost $150 per person for food and service worth $35.  And left hungry.  I regularly eat at great Sushi places in both California and New York and I wouldn't go back to Andrea's even if the prices were reasonable.   But considering the price, my advice is to look elsewhere!  There are simply too many good restaurants to overpay for mediocre food and lazy service.",

The only part that we might have liked was the appetizer fish sushi, not recommended and definitely my first and last time there, last but not least the bill came out to 800!!

We were there at the restaurant opening tonight. Steve Wynn was also eating there with his wife and guests!   OK - to the food:  great balance of asian and fine dining!  We had the Rock Fish Tempura - generous portion, wonderfully prepared, more than enough as a starter for 2.  We had sushi - the eel roll and it was also excellent - my wife enjoys that particular roll and says that it was the best she's had.   Our main meal was the Wagyu beef sliced for 2.   It was awesome!  I normally shun any sauce on steak, but we had it on the side, and it was a wonderful complement.  We've eaten at SW, Botero, Picasso, Michael Mina, and the food was in this class!    The environment is way more hip.  Think cocktails vs. big wine lists and cool music vs. heavy upholstery.  One of the guys at the bar started dancing and tipped the DJ for more 80s tunes!     Highly recommend!",

We walked to the restaurant and they immediately seated us.  The ambiance is amazing, and the service is top notch.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  They are flexible enough to substitute meat with any veggies.  In addition, they have a vegetarian section in their menu that includes sushi rolls, entrees, and sides.  I ordered the following: - Steamed Edamame - Crispy Pan Fried Noodles: I asked them to remove the chicken, and they were very willing.  The noodles were delicious. - My co-worker order the vegetarian sushi rolls (cucumber, and avocado/asparagus): The sushi rolls were amazing.  I think I liked them more than my noodles. - For dessert, we ordered a trio ice-cream combo, where we could choose three flavors from a list of 10.  It was delicious.  I would have loved to try other things on their menu, but I just wasn't that hungry.  I would love to go back and try the other vegetarian options on the menu.  Our server was very attentive, and ensured we were well taken care of.  Overall, a great team dinner and a great evening.",

Skip the expensive drinks and go straight to their not-so-authentic but very delicious take on Asian Fusion!  - Sinatra Drink - 1 star: Medicinal and expensive - Steamed Seabass - 3.5 stars: Famous dish, served with a ginger scallion Chinese sauce. Flaky, delicate, flavorful but a little small.  -  Miso Black Cod - 4 stars: Delicious and buttery. The seabass and the cod were very different but I think I prefer the cod because it was more flavorful  - Bacon Fried Rice: 2.5 stars: Bacon was very thick and flavorful but chewy and tough; the rice tasted dry like pilaf. Beautiful, but do not recommend. - Brussels Sprouts - 4.5 stars: Crispy, deep-fried leaves sweetened with balsamic glaze.  - Tuna Tataki - 4 stars: Mixed reviews on this, but I really enjoyed it because it was flavorful and crunchy. The tuna could've been better quality but it was overall a tasty dish - Mango roll - 4 stars: Looking for a flavorful but inauthentic roll? This is it! Crunchy and delicious.  - Pork Adobo Sisig - 3.5 stars: Tasty, a bit salty. Not sure if I would order again.  - Peanut dessert - 4 stars: Three portions of peanut mousse on a crispy peanut brittle crust (you can order it with fourth piece if needed). It was very rich and decadent I loved that there was a crunchy crust  - Mochi ice cream - 3.5 stars: Good but standard",

I'll admit, nothing about this place says Asian. I had actually forgotten that's what we were going for until I saw the chopsticks on the table. It's definitely an impressive space, a great space for dinner with friends as you get the night started or for an intimate date. We sat in one of the booths on the side, which is excellent as it's the kind where it's your own little room. Helpful for two sometimes deaf people like us, especially in a place that I'm sure can get pretty noisy once it gets rolling.   The service is impeccable. Not only knowledgeable, but professional and possessive of that way of being able to read the table as to what kind of mood they're going for.",

Mixologist at the bar was shaking those drinks like aerobics...there was so much effort and precision to make each drink and they tasted so well balanced and delicious.  Ambiance is retro chic. Think mod squad meets 1960s Mad Men era lounge. You feel really transported. There's specail tables along the sides with curtains that give you a private room feeling...be sure to request for those!   Food was mind blowing. We ordered off the Vegan menu and it was end to end the one of the best meals we have ever had. We had the Gardein lettuce wraps (amazing lemon ginger flavor...best preparation of Gardein we have ever had), Kimchi fried rice with Portobello Galbi (mushroom was seasoned so well...sweet and spicy flavors) and the veggie sushi roll. We went silent at the table; the food left us speechless in a good way.  We told the waiter at the beginning we were celebrating our first anniversary and when the bill came, he brought out personalized chopsticks with our names on it and these amazing cake pops on the house. The service was perfect. Thank you for such a memorable evening, Andrea's!",

I'm glad I went as I enoyed the food and the company of Christie O, Michele H, Lisa R and hubby, Kevin P and of course, Amanda M and hubby.  Christie got me a Red Velvet Chocolate Martini since we got there early - it was absolutely delicious! The martini glass rim had freeze-dried raspberries - the absolute \"Cathy drink\" since I'm chocoholic. Christie made a friend out of the bartender, Omar who's very knowledgeable about vodka.  As soon as everyone else arrived and I was about done admiring the modern elegance of the restaurant, we got seated.  I got the hamachi sashimi, filet mignon and the cake pop trio.  Hamachi Sashimi: Thinly-sliced fresh hamachi in ponzu with crispy garlic, cilantro and pickled cherry peppers on top. So yummy!  The garlic is quite pronounced...and I love garlic! 4/5  Filet Mignon: 7oz filet with sudachi hollandaise. Very tender...cooked medium-rare as always although the picture came out looking like it was cooked well-done. Comes with potatoes. The hollandaise was delicious with a hint of citrus. 4/5  Ice Cream Trio: Sake cherry, chocolate and honey pistachio. I could've picked the cake pop trio since I'm lactose intolerant but I've never been a big fan of those. The ice cream trio was amazing sans the stomach ache. I enjoyed all 3 flavors. I saved chocolate for last - it was spicy and had a very mild hint of cinnamon. 5/5  Excellent service from the hostess, bartender and our server.",

    "text": "Being Vegas veterans, hubby and I typically eschew the trendy, hip, Asian fusion restaurants found in casinos.  So I wasn't too optimistic when we went to Vegas one weekend with some friends and decided to come here.  Hubby had been once before and gave it his most ringing endorsement \"Not bad.\"  Uh oh...  Cut to our evening...the place is beautiful.  It's exactly what you'd expect out of a hip and trendy Asian fusion restaurant.  They also have cool, semi-private booths built best for two people.  The decor is gorgeous!  At this point, still wary about the food...  Friend and I showed up fashionably late.  Our SO's had come by to check in and get the party started.  By the time we arrived, a nice bottle of wine had already been decanted and poured.  For apps, we started with the shishito peppers, the steamed edamame and the rock shrimp tempura and some grilled diver scallops.  The peppers and edamame sound pedestrian but the way they were prepared was really delicious!  The rock shrimp and the scallops were solid as well.  So far so good...  It was around this time we went onto our 2nd bottle of wine.  The sommelier was super friendly and shared his fancy Riedel decanters with us.  The \"boa\" was my favorite both in appearance and in how to pour the wine.    For entrees, we went with a crispy pata (a Filipino-inspired dish, I'm sure) and I went with the steamed sea bass.  Hubby says his was ok.  I had a small piece and thought it was amazing.  He wasn't a huge fan of the sides (pickled veggies).  My steamed sea bass was pretty tasty though after what we had prior to the entrees, it was a little light on the flavor spectrum.  Service was hit or miss.  Everyone was super friendly and, at times, attentive.  Towards the end of our meal, we saw less and less of everyone (which is ok) but eventually water and wine were harder to come by (which is why we learned how to pour our own wine out of the \"boa\"). Ok, I sound like a brat but they were seriously pouring our wine for us, constantly...plus we didn't want to break one of those fancy decanters.    Definitely better than I expected but I guess I shouldn't be surprised...this is The Wynn after all...!",

The service was great, servers check on you in perfect moderation. It's located in the Wynn, next to an Asian restaurant Mizumi. So first off, I had a great cocktail, off the menu. I asked for a skinny margarita, and what I got was incredible (props to the bartender). We ordered miso soup which comes in a huge bowl, recommended. Also cucumber sunomuno, tiger shrimp, and albacore sashimi, all of which I was very unimpressed by. The tuna salad however was delicious, as well as the ice cream sampler. Definitely recommend trying their mini ice cream cones.",

I try not to post reviews of my favorite restaurants anymore because when I do it becomes almost impossible to get a reservation.   We have eaten at Andrea's over 10 times.  I can guarantee you have never had to Tataki Kobe beef under a bell filled with smoke before,  and once you do you will crave it for years to come.    No jeans no tank tops just beautiful people having beautiful meals.   The drink menu is extensive as is the Decor.    The tables are always properly placed under the lights above in order to light up your dishes perfectly.     Now that we have moved to Las Vegas from Chicago I can imagine I will be eating here more often my mouth is now watering I'm just going to make a reservation for dinner tonight can't wait even if I must go alone totally worth it love this place.    Andrea is Steve Wynn's daughter and the encore hotel which houses this awesome restaurant is decorated in every corner to the highest amount of luxury you can imagine if you have the time and money splurge.",

There was wasabi, decorative sauce on the plate and ample amount of food. It was beautifully decorated and delicious. It was filling too. I tried the Brussels sprouts which had like a balsamic and soy reduction plus charred like. Very well done. A little goes along way and should be shared. For dessert we had the vegan chocolate cookie dough cake pop that was out of this world!!   I want to return. I reccommend this place. Must try it!    Won't disappoint.",

(served over wasabi demiglace)  The NY Strip is slowly becoming one of my favorite steaks.  This dish is not served like a typical steak, it's served in a log shape, and sliced into about 10 pieces.  The ends were fatty (didn't even eat them) but the rest of the slices were cooked to medium perfection.  Taking each piece and dipping it in the the demiglace, oh myy!!!  Although I am not a huge strip restaurant fan, I put this in the top for the area.  Highly recommended.",

I'm a local myself & I've been here on three different occasions & I can't get enough! I did my usual check in & I squealed when I received a coupon for 30% off drinks for vegas locals! The staff was happy to honor my discount :)  This review is a combination of my last two visits!  I headed to the bar since I was early for the reservation. I always go straight to the signature cocktails. I ordered The Lulu, which was awesome! It wasn't busy at the bar but it took quite a while for my card to be taken to swipe. Me & my girlfriends got a booth like we requested. They are very intimate & fit up to four people. I got the same server, Kyle as I did on my last visit. He recognized me which is always cool. Best server award goes to him! He gives so much detail about the menu & how to go about ordering. Family style is whats recommended & it is the best idea. Everything is shared at the table & everyone gets to try all the items. Through each section he pointed out some popular items & we ordered ALL of them! The items we ordered were the Rock Shrimp Tempura, \"Smoked\" Wagyu Beef Tataki (my absolute favorite & the presentation is the best), Saikyo Miso Black Cod (wow!), Sliced Prime New York Strip, Crispy Broccoli, Shrimp Tempura + Spicy Tuna roll (8 pieces). We also ordered other items like Tuna Tataki Salad, Shrimp Pad Thai, Chinese Sausage + Pineapple Fried Rice, Crab Fried Rice, & the Duck Confit Lo Mein which were all great as well. I ordered the Asian Pear from the cocktail list. It's a woman's drink for sure!  I hope it was in your game plan to save room for dessert cause you would be missing out if you didn't! Flaming Mt. Fuji! It's large, it's chocolatey & it's on fire! The four of us girls couldn't finish it of course. It's such a fun dessert to share with your friends. Devil's food cake & mousse inside with a toasted marshmallow outside that they pour Bacardi 151 over & light up! To accompany my dessert, I ordered an Espresso Martini. So far, the best one yet.   Andrea's is a good time. The room is beautiful, the staff is on point, the service is outstanding & the food is phenomenal. It's the perfect place to get the night started before heading out to the Wynn or Encore's best nightclubs.",

After walking across the open layout of the dining area and then being shown to our table, an iPad is placed in front of you displaying a nice list of cocktail and other beverage options. A few moments is given to glance over the list of drinks and then you are immediately greeted by your server for the night. Daniel (if I recall correctly) was our server for the evening and he provided awesome service. Daniel and the other servers at Andrea's go above and beyond and bring out a plethora of different options when something as simple as wasabi is asked for - a really nice plus. Other than the service, the food was really great as well; the sushi tasted very fresh and the entrees had tons of flavor. The portions at were also reasonably sized for the price and they didn't leave you hungry like some other high-end restaurants. Furthermore, at the end of the evening they brought out a nice dessert and birthday candle for my girlfriend. Overall, if you're looking for a top-notch asian cuisine experience in Vegas, you can't go wrong with Andrea's at Encore.",

I like the way our waiter proposed we order, basically we would order 1-2 small plates to share and they brought them out as they were ready. We ended up having the tuna-crispy rice, hamachi sashimi, ramen sliders and coconut spinach. I have a big appetite and sometimes end up with a huge bill at a fancy restaurant trying to get full, but we filled up fast as you had time to really enjoy each dish and even though the portions are not huge, they were certainly satisfying. They had a good beer selection with what I would call appropriate beers for the food, I had a Belgian pale ale that went really well with everything. Wife had a Manhattan that she said was amazing. For dessert we had the orange ball, the presentation alone was so unique I was already impressed. I think this may be my new favorite on the strip.",

Our waitress Mya was extremely patient and very helpful when it came to the menu.  My aunts had never been before.  We ordered the \"bringing sexy back\" cocktail.  Absolutely delicious! Then we decided to order a few things and share. 1. Edamame with the truffle salt- to die for 2. Chow fun- A very nice portion, more than enough for us to share 3. Salmon Sashimi- Extremely fresh and had a very smooth and creamy texture 4. Shrimp and Lobster sauce- I was actually under the impression that it was grilled Lobster but it was fried.  Good flavor but we all thought it was a bit chewy. 5. Rock shrimp tempura-  Will be a staple item whenever I go again.  Delicious!  Overall we had a wonderful experience.  They were able to fit us in for a reservation on a saturday night and I only called about an hour and a half in advance.  A plus plus for customer service! My aunt had a wonderful birthday dinner. Oh and lets not forget the cute chopsticks with \"Happy birthday\" on them as well as the yummy cake pop!  I will continue to come here.",

When people are spending this kind of money you expect quality and top-notch service. We had neither. Not only was the waitress unattentive and came back to get us another round of drinks every 20 minutes or so the food (which comes shared) came about 20 minutes between dishes. The sushi that was served was bland and a plain asparagus roll was one of the three rolls offered. Again for that kind of money you expect more than a sushi roll with just a piece of asparagus in it. The whole meal took roughly three hours and the entire party was unimpressed and $210 poorer. Like I said previously really was the worst meal I've ever had dollar for dollar.",

We had a VIP table which was a very private booth.   Food and drinks were amazing! We were given iPads to order drinks from. We started with the edamame and the bigeye tuna and crispy rice. Both were delicious! For our entrees we had the crab fried rice, shrimp tempura & spicy tuna, and the special cucumber roll. Everything was fresh and tasty!   Only negative, we kinda felt like they were rushing us out to turnover our table. Would highly recommend it to anyone staying at the Wynn or Encore. If you are going to eat at one place while staying there, Andrea's is the place!",

We enjoyed a majority of the food: Miso Cod - small but yum Tempura/spicy tuna roll- always a winner broccoli side - makes eating your veggies a breeze salmon tartare- preeetty.. oh. and it tastes good  We also ordered the Wagyu beef & lobster roll. My friend and I each had a piece and looked at each other funny. We felt it was either under-seasoned or just an odd combo. My friend had another piece just to check (so we ate 3 pieces of an 8 piece roll). She called over the waiter who got the manager and the blunt wonder that she is, stated flatly \"We tried this roll and it's not very good...\" (wow. thanks Lauren). without skipping a beat the manager said very charmingly (new word) \"What can I get you instead?\" we asked for a roll suggestion and bam one plate gone another in its place (the aforementioned delicious spicy tuna roll mmm.) long story short (too late) I appreciated the classy way our situation was handled. I mean, it was very expensive dish (thank you wagyu) and we were not charged despite admittedly taste testing it to an extreme.   Overall, if you're looking for the \"I'm in Vegas\" experience, look no further. I would visit it again, and given the many amazing restaurants in the area, that's really saying something.",

The decor is fiendishly nice as befits the Encore; decadent but not ostentatious, simple but radiant & bright - perfect for a meal of this magnitude. Again, expect to sit for at least three hours because they are always crowded and the haughty servers do you no favors, but this is dining at it's most fun - especially if you're on a business tab.",

They were completely understanding and sat us right away when we arrived. The hosts were so friendly and nice. Our server was also very informative and professional. Ambiance is very trendy and fun! Perfect for a girls' night out.  The food: AMAZING.  1. The asian pear cocktail was so sweet and delicious, a few of us ordered that.  2. Brussel sprouts and shishito peppers were amazing sides. 3. Filet was cooked to perfection and it comes with three delicious sauces. 4. Lobster jalapeno tempura was the star of the show for me - so delicious.  Overall, this place is fantastic.

Server : moon, she was amazing but timing was off... Way way off. We waited so long In between courses and cocktails. But she was lovely so Maybe the bartender or the kitchen was the problem.   Food: Shishto pepper: peanut sauce, some were soggy some were al dente some seemed raw.   Edamame: truffle infused... Best thing we had   House salad: really?? You'd charge for lettuce and some sort of vinaigrette?  Tempura; 6 itty bitty dime sized shrimp? Tempura rolls.   Pad Thai: the worst I've ever had. Tasted like soggy egg noodles with absolutely NO flavor.   Duck lo mein: gross tastes just like the pad Thai, bland, flavorless, and boring with tiny piece if dried duck    Chicken dish which was TINY and what should have been crunchy was soggy.   Wok fried broccoli: yum   Chocolate mousse: yum",

    "text": "Even though I am generally reluctant to dine at any of the upscale, non sushi-centric Asian restaurants on The Strip, I usually end up leaving pretty happy with the meals.  On a recent visit for my wife's birthday dinner, Andrea's continuously hit high marks, plate after plate after plate.  Yes, it costs more than Spring Mountain, but there's a quality of ingredients here that is unparalleled to most spots a few miles southwest of Encore.    The ambiance is really nice - the cool lighting, upscale late 70's furnishings with accompanying music that dabbled into the 80's as the night went on made me feel like this was the kind of place to pregame before going to Studio 54.  Andrea Wynn's eyes all lit up behind the bar were strangely soothing.  The 3 cucumber/gin cocktails only enhanced that effect.  With a party of 8, we opted to go omakase family style.  The waiter asked for a per person price to adhere to along with any items we were not interested in (ah-hem....$9 miso soup) and then we awaited the surprises from the kitchen.  \"Seafood on Ice\" may sound like the worst ice skating show ever (ok,ok a gigantic oyster doing a triple axle might possibly awesome), but these treasures from the ocean were excellent.  The slow poached prawns were shrimp cocktail for kings, and the initial bite of the marinated bay scallop totally wowed me with its freshness.  Crab legs, oysters, Maine lobster and tuna poke made life even better.     The \"Steamed Sea Bass\" was exquisite.  It started tender on the outside and got tendererererererer as you got to the center.  The ginger, garlic, mushroom, lemon and cilantro made for a simple but divine combination for such a fantastic cut of fish.  I bet Roger Federerererererer would like this.  Everything else was very enjoyable including the tuna+crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura, hamachi sashimi, sliced prime New York strip, adobo crab fried rice, and the Saikyo miso black cod among other items.     It was impossible to say no to the Mt Fuji dessert.  I mean....how do you NOT take photos and videos of this behemoth of sugar as they pour the Bacardi 151 and set it on fire???  I found it to be a bit too alcohol-y for my taste, but totally worth the \"show\" factor.  It was a great ending to the meal.  Color me reluctant no more!",

    "text": "Elegantly nestled in Encore, Andrea's was a beautifully luxuriant experience in fine dining. Service was impeccable, the venue was intimate, and the food was delightful. The price point was unsurprising in such a location and of such a caliber, but overall I felt that the quality and experience was worth the asking price.  Red wines: Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=NvDzV3rEHbrvKwQFJOBteA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=S8-aox-QgkpS95xAAOppew&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I don't exactly remember which years and vineyards these wines came from, as I went with my server's suggestions, but I liked both quite well. The Cabernet Sauvignon was very smooth but still retained some of its acidity while the Pinot Noir was lighter and sweeter. Both went exceptionally well with the wagyu steak, foie gras, and even the seafood in lieu of white wine.  Wagyu steak (4oz): (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IdIIv2oMKefa77_HvLFSjg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) Succulent and tender, this strip of steak was melt-in-your-mouth with every bite. 4oz was the perfect size, as it was generous enough to be satisfying while still left room for other tasty dishes. There was slight uneven marbling towards one end, but it was barely noticeable. I preferred the dish without the tangy acidity of the grilled lemon, but it was a nice way to cut the richness towards the end.  Sliced prime New York strip: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c2-pnJNESt8yjgNC6p0cWg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) Compared to the wagyu steak, which came before this dish, the New York strip paled. It was still well-grilled and a nice medium, but it was understandably leaner and thus a bit tougher. The sauce coating the top was also slightly on the salty side, but overall a pretty solid dish.   Seared foie gras: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=auLDDRVewxu6iNoTtalu5w&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I've pretty much loved every preparation of foie gras I've ever had, and the quality of foie gras here was exceptional. The slight sear on both sides was gentle enough to leave a good amount of foie gras sashimi-style in the middle, and its buttery nature paired well with the citrus. I understood the garnish on top, and it did add a pop of decoration, but I could have done without texturally. The taro chips, which were perfectly fried, were well-paired.   Diver sea scallops with mustard miso: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kMfOYixcnypCH5-fDp0fYA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I enjoy scallops, but they're not my favorite from the seafood group. These were not overcooked, but I missed that slightly smoky sear on either side. Not a bad dish, but not particularly memorable for me.   Crispy brussels sprouts with balsamic soy reduction: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ArbX0hOg2XQlTv_lcToPSg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) This is one of my favorite preparations of brussels sprouts, despite it perhaps not being exactly the healthiest preparation.. These were fried to a perfect crisp, and the thin layers of brussels sprouts were separated to become brussels sprouts chips, which may not sound appetizing, but they absolutely were. The balsamic soy reduction gave the chips a nice vinegary flavoring, which kept them from becoming too heavy despite being fried.  Saikyo miso black cod: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=utNkVOPcsKqLohOCGC8-hQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) This dish came as highly recommended, and it was nicely cooked, albeit a little salty. The black cod was tender and flaky, but it might have been marinated a bit too long. The blackened skin also provided a nice crunchy contrast to the softness of the fish.   Shrimp tempura and spicy tuna roll: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pRn4DH-1_7QOmhC8oTX1Lw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) We ordered this on a whim, but I would perhaps stick with the prior dishes rather than venture into the more fusion-y ones on my next visit. This roll was nicely made and quite tasty, but there was nothing super memorable about it for me. The mango on top was an interesting complement to the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna, but I have yet to find a roll that pairs fruit with seafood without making it seem rather dissonant.   Chocolate orange sphere with hot fudge poured on top: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OxkE_GCJf2AjBTMG7pe6ow&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rYxWBIbcd7ppAgEQTHfGwQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) This was an amazingly decadent dessert, and I'm usually not a fan of orange and chocolate combinations. It was served as an orange sphere, and then the hot fudge was poured over top, melting the outside thin layer of chocolate and exposing the truffle-like interior. The components were thoughtfully and beautifully made, and the balance between fruit and chocolate was spot on.",

    "text": "Yes, it is expensive but I'd like to put it into perspective. We went for my son's birthday. The 13 year old really enjoyed it and so did the parents. My husband and I shared the seafood platter. It was $55 and I thought that was a good deal: two Alaskan King crab legs, 4 oysters, ceviche, poke, lobster salad, and huge prawns. The poke was tasty, a little on the sweet side. Love the lobster salad. The ceviche was lemony. I can't remember what type of oyster... maybe Kushi? I've paid similar price for non-Strip restaurants that serve similar so I thought it was reasonable.   We had sliders, rock shrimp tempura, spicy jidori chicken, and pork belly. The guys gobbled everything up. I had a bite of shrimp tempura and jidori chicken - both were tasty. The chicken wasn't spicy for us, since we're Korean and handle more heat. I thought it was mild. They also allow you to order sliders in the number you need. They usually come in threes, but we were able to get four.  For mains, we had some rib eye and steamed sea bass, and shared a whole bunch of sides which come in very small sizes... so for example the fried rice is more like a single portion if you were to just eat friend rice... about 1-1/2 cups. We ordered asparagus - the preserved lemon on these are delicious and unexpected. It brightened them in a way that made me crave them the day after. The broccoli was just that.The fried rice was also not as impressive. The Crispy Pan Fried Noodles I'd order again. We said we'd order more but we were pretty full and still had dessert.   The main reason we went to this restaurant was for the Mt. Fuji dessert. The whole cake is lit and it goes up into a fierce flame. It looked amazing. The outer cover is marshmallow fluff and it gets toasted. It's a chocolate cake and was definitely worth the trip. I would have given it a 5 stars for the cake, but it lost points for some of the lackluster sides.   It's also very loud, but fun. Maybe I'd go earlier next time. We had 8:45 reservations and was seated at 9pm... but it was the only time that we would make after a show at another hotel.   I think the whole bill without alcohol including tip was close to $450 for 4 people.",

Recommendations: Crispy Brussels sprouts were a crowd pleaser along with the wok-fried broccoli. I would recommend definitely getting these dishes as appetizers or sides to a meal. The tuna + crispy rice, yellow-tail sashimi, and the spicy tuna roll were my personal favorite dishes. I would not recommend the punch bowl (very little hard liquor) nor the vegetable pan fried noodles.  Overall: great experience and service for a large party.

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night with 3 of my girlfriends, before the Britney Spears concert. We originally had a reservation for 3 but a 4th friend flew in from Boston to surprise me and the reservations were never updated (b/c I wasn't supposed to know about it - and I had made the reservation). There was no issue with this at all when we arrived at the restaurant. We got there about 15 minutes early and we were promptly seated at our table. The decor is so sleek, and I loved how open the restaurant is. It has a nice vibe. Our server was attentive and pleasant the entire time we were there.  The reason we chose this restaurant was simply because 2 of us wanted to try the Impossible Burger dishes they had! I am not a vegetarian but my friend is - and we were both very intrigued. So after learning about the Impossible Burger online and seeing it was on the menu, we couldn't come to Vegas without a visit to Andrea's!  As others have mentioned - Yes, everything is on the pricey side. From cocktails, to apps, to main dishes... you will fork over some cash. But from my experience, the food and the service was worth it. Plus, you are dining at an upscale restaurant in Vegas. Pricey menu items should come as no surprise!  We started with a round of cocktails at $16 a piece. I don't exactly remember what I ordered but it was damn delicious. Light and refreshing... I could have downed 3 of those babies, but I knew I would be drinking it up at the concert so I just had the one cocktail at dinner. We didn't bother with apps and got right to ordering. 2 of us each ordered the Impossible burger sliders (which is actually a $25 app), another friend had a couple of sushi rolls, while the other friend had a veggie stir fry dish I believe? Anyway, considering we didn't actually order entrees it was plenty of food for a meal. If you have not yet heard about the Impossible Burger, look it up. It is a plant based \"red meat\" (it isn't really meat, duh). But it is made to look, cook, taste and even sizzle like red meat. Seriously go watch the videos. The way the sliders were prepared were delicious! I am a meat eater through and through and if you had not told me that these sliders were not actually red meat, I don't think I would have been able to tell. Now, I did take some of the meat out alone so I could taste it without the bun and sauce and everything else they put on the sliders. When I did that, I could definitely tell that it did not have the True taste of red meat, since there is a bit of a different after taste. BUT - these sliders were fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to order them again if I ever found myself back at Andrea's!  We were celebrating 3 October birthdays out of the 4 of us that were dining that night. Our server brought 3 little individual dessert for each of us that had an October birthday. I totally did not expect that! It was a fun little way to end the meal.  Overall it was a great experience and delicious food.",

    "text": "Vegan in Las Vegas isn't always easy when you are on the strip. Especially if you want more than just a veggie burger and a boring salad. We were so excited to find Andrea's!   We stumbled upon the menu while planning an evening exploring the Wynn, and we were searching yelp for a place with Vegan options. We didn't have reservations, the place was packed on a Monday, but they were able to sit us at a bistro table in the bar area. Now, this was the first table by the host stand, which typically would make for a not so great dining experience. But from start to finish we had great service, amazing food and we have zero complaints.   We were greeted immediately and before we could even ask for vegan options we were presented with an entire vegan and vegetarian menu. You read that right, each table is presented with an epic separate veggie menu, no \"let me ask the chef\" with an eye roll or \"maybe a salad with no dressing\" after asking. We were in heaven.   We started with the shishito peppers and crispy ginger gyoza. Then split the vegan spicy veggie roll and the impossible burger sliders. Finished with a vegan cookie dough cake pop. Shared a bottle of yummy bubbly. Holy. Crap.   Now, the impossible burgers definitely lived up to the hype- we could have devoured about 40 of them. Surprisingly, the most delicious thing we ate was the vegan spicy roll! It had been so long since we had a veggie sushi roll that had actual flavor and different textures that we about passed out from pure happiness.   So the moral of this story. If you are a vegan in Vegas, and you want a more upscale dining experience that doesn't involve manipulating a menu or asking the chef to make something up then Andrea's is highly recommended.",

    "text": "With interesting Asian fusion flavor combinations, my mouth definitely left Andrea's happy!  With mysterious female eyes plastered all over and the hipster nighttime club vibe, I felt as if I were transported to a modern day Great Gatsby party.  With a full service bar and with a view of Surrender nightclub from the seats, the restaurant feeds into the opulence of Vegas party nightlife.  Although the menu touts an extensive cocktail menu that can be done on an iPad, I decided to focus primarily on the food.  Here is what my friends and I shared:  **TABLE SHARES** TUNA SASHIMI ON CRISPY RICE: Could easily have eaten a whole plate of this by myself!  What really makes this dish is the crunchiness of the slightly overcooked rice that perfectly offsets the smooth tuna sashimi.  When combined with the spiciness of spicy mayo and the slightly sweet sauce on the sashimi, I just loved it!  HAMACHI: Its simplicity is what makes this dish so amazing.  The thinly sliced yellowtail is delicately seasoned with a pickled cherry pepper, cilantro, and soy. With the crispy garlic slice on top, provides the perfect contrast and extra kick to each bite.   ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA SWEET PONZU AND ARUGULA: Enjoyed a lot!  Nice hot pieces of shrimp that had a nice crunch covered with a sweet and spicy sauce.  I loved that the sweetness was balanced with the bed of bitter arugula.  (Avoid!) PORK BELLY SISIG:  Although I enjoyed the nice fatty pieces of braised pork, I didn't particularly find the dish as a whole as special.  I could understand the subtle heat from the sauce and red onion, but besides these flavors, I did not find it amazing.  For this dish, the waiter told us later that you are meant to break the yolk and mix in with the other ingredients while the skillet is still piping hot.  Because we weren't told until after the skillet was cold, that could explain why the dish seemed a little one note.    **EXTRAS** CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS: As a big fan of brussel sprouts, I did enjoy this dish!  The brussel sprouts had a slight char to them and covered with a nice sweet soy sauce.  However, what made this dish great were the slivers of almonds to add an extra crunch to each bite.  FRIED SMASHED POTATOES:  Piping hot and well seasoned, these potatoes were pretty darn good!  The sauce was slightly spicy and added an extra kick to each bite.  **MEAT** JIDORI CHICKEN BREAST: Although the chicken was well cooked and tender, I was underwhelmed by this selection given the other amazing flavors I had experienced before this.  In the end, it just felt like a really fancy chicken soup to me because there was nothing about this dish that really stood out in terms of flavor.  The chicken sits in a light broth and garnished with ginger, garlic, and micro greens.    **DESSERT** FLAMING MT. FUJI: An amazing tableside service makes this a dessert worthy for ordering!  After seeing several other tables order this, we knew we had to have it.  The chocolate food cake is covered with layers or marshmallow shaped to look like a massive mountain.  When the waiter comes by, he pours some of the rum around the cake and then lights it up for an amazing visual spectacle.  As for the taste?  Also great!  Along with the chocolate cake there are slivers of chocolates to add texture to the creamy marshmallow topping.  In terms of service, the service staff was generally nice but the wait for food was pretty ridiculous.  Between the time we got our appetizers and our entrees was close to an hour.  I understand that the food is a delicate process but it really drained our time.  Overall, I would say that if you are in Vegas and looking for a unique fine dining experience, Andrea's is a great place to go!",

As a Filipino, I was happy to see Filipino inspired dishes on the menu.  I guess it's not surprising since the chef is Filipino.  All the dishes we ordered were on point!  Omi (MUST ORDER if available) - a special type of Kobe beef with an A5 rating.  Very rare to find outside of Japan.  Long story short, 8 thinly sliced pieces of this beef was worth $70!  Cooked to perfection and will just melt in your mouth!  Miso Black Cod (MUST ORDER) - rich, delicious taste but the portion might not be satisfactory to most since it's $32.  You're paying for the quality!  Crispy Pata (MUST ORDER if you're craving something fried) - fried to a perfect crisp.  The piece we got was very meaty and not too fatty which is key to a good crispy pata.    Crab Fried Rice (MUST ORDER side) - real crab pieces and they weren't stingy with the crab.  Brussels Sprouts - Full of flavor, pan-fried with some balsamic reduction sauce.  Very good!  They also have a great selection of craft cocktails and an extensive wine list.  And to boot, service was impeccable!",

There's nothing I can say about this restaurant that hasn't already been said. We got the cute chopsticks and a private booth for our anniversary dinner. Brennan our waiter was delightful and gave us impeccable service.  I would like to add that the impossible burger is a must try. As a meat-eater I was certainly confused when the slider wasn't rubbery and didn't have that FAKE meat aftertaste. The texture was very close and the taste is..like a diluted burger. Like someone rubbed a real meat patty on the impossible burger. Chow fung noodles were delicious and traditional. We also had their ice cream flight (apparently new on the dessert menu). All flavors-- ube, red bean, thai tea, Vietnamese coffee, black sesame, avocado cream, matcha green tea, and coconut sorbet (my favorite)-- were so good. The way it's served is also a showstopper as it comes on a huge tower!",

It's a nice upscale restaurant, but nothing out of the ordinary. The reason for my low review is because on our last visit made 12/25/18, three out of five of us at the table got tremendously sick to the point where we had to cancel our flights the following day. We are 100% certain we got sick from this restaurant and when we filed a report, they denied all responsibility. When we asked them to share their internal report to prove their fish was kept at the correct temperature or other problems that could have occurred such as the fish not being fresh, they denied access to evidence. For such an upscale restaurant, I was not happy with their food not their cooperation.",

At the table we had a very nice and subtle 2015 rose (whispering angel) and here is my final suggestion on the drinks....ORDER THE ASIAN PEAR!

Simple, delicate and flavorful w/ the miso.  - Yellowtail & whitefish tempura roll: 4 stars - delicious and buttery, but kind of forgot about it  - Seared scallops: 4.5 stars - I may be biased because I rarely meet a seared scallops I didn't like. Super meaty and big scallops that were seared perfectly.  - A5 wagyu smoked tataki: 5 stars - presentation was impressive. A5 wagyu.

Good, but not the best.  -Crispy pan fried noodles w/ shrimp: 4 stars - great flavors and similar to the ones I had growing up in SF -desserts: 4 stars - forgot the names of them, but they were yummy and had a good balance of flavors and textures.  Overall, great experience in a beautifully decorated dining room. The pacing was a bit off, but the waiter let us know that there are two different kitchens and they don't coordinate?

Andrea's is definitely a must do on anyone's list as many of you may know that the Encore and Wynn Las Vegas restaurants all offer vegan options and I must say Andrea's did not fall short at all. I enjoyed overlooking the beautiful restaurant from a private booth which was the best seating I have ever had being that I am a booth only person and do not feel comfortable sitting at a table in the middle of any restaurant. I tried two new recently added items from the non-vegan menu but is indeed vegan just on the wrong menu for some reason. Both were entrees but I selected the first one and used it as an appetizer with no regrets LOL, it was crispy lettuce cups made with the impossible burger...Mmm Mmm Good! The second one was a Thai inspired beef entree which I forgot the name so please forgive me but it was damn good also made with the impossible burger. Did I mention that Andrea's is an Asian fusion restaurant. Everything was so tasty and so good I even ate my edible flower that was the garnish for my tasty drink. The waitstaff was absolutely one of the best and I have to give kudos to Bruce and Thomas both were superior!!! I cannot wait for my return hopefully very soon.",

    "text": "The restaurant is beautiful and birthday celebrations were going off all around us.  Most groups were being delivered this torched marshmallow cone cake with candles, which looked impressive and fun.  Only three of us ate, however, so we didn't opt for such a large - albeit tempting - dessert. Our birthday girl had to make due with a chocolate globe filled with cake and ice cream.  I just saw a video of this online, so when I saw Andrea's had one on the menu, I knew we had to get it. The server poured hot chocolate over it, and the globe melted away to reveal the goodies inside.  Entertainment + food!  The three of us decided to go family style and ordered the filet with a wasabi demi glace, the black cod, the sea bass, the brussel sprouts, and the green beans with little shrimp.  Oh, we also split a $100 bottle of wine.  I didn't choose it, so I can't reveal the name, but it was lovely.   Everything was wonderful and different.  The steak was tender and well-seasoned, the cod was sweet, and the sea bass was herby and refreshing.  The green beans were a nice base to the meal, and the crispy sprouts were oily and salty - a great contrast to everything else.  Upon leaving we used the restroom, and the only available stall was broken.  Pardon the visual, but my friend and I both peed into a toilet that didn't flush, so we were just adding our touches to what everyone else left behind.  Yum!  The restaurant is also right next door to Surrender, so it's super convenient if that's your next destination.  We went over to XS, but it wasn't that far of a walk.",

What really stood out though and puts it at the top of dining options on the strip is how accommodating they are compared to most places on the strip.   1. They were able to easily accommodate our party of 15 (most places are not) 2. They had an extensive list of options for vegans and gluten free (we had a few)  I cannot recommend this place more for large groups, vegans, gluten free and anyone wanting a premier dining experience on the strip!",

Our server was super nice and brought out a huge bev dispenser for the table full of the most delicious cocktail I've had all year. Some apricot vodka concoction that gave me all the life. Extra points for convenient refills!  Our menu was prix fixe style, and the courses didn't take long coming out. They were super accommodating for the 2 of us who have seafood allergies and brought out different stuff for us.  A salad and some veggie rolls came out first, both of them good. Then some truly delightful chicken fried rice. Soon thereafter, some veggie lo mein...Now as a lover of all $5 shopping center chinese food spot lo mein, I wanted to be a fan of this stuff so bad. It was SO bland. Only took a few bites and let it sit there. Glad that part was free.  An assortment of cake pops came out for dessert, and my coconut pineapple one was quite lovely. Wish I had sampled some of the others, as a few ladies didn't end up taking one. I was a little jealous that we didn't get one of those flaming dessert thingies, but maybe next time.  Great tasting experience with excellent service from every staff member we encountered. Fat tip well deserved.",

The fried garlic they had on top had the perfect crunch. I also really enjoyed our steak. I got it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! So delicious! The only disappointing thing was our lo mein. When the dish came out, it was a bit cold. You can tell it had been sitting there for a bit because when it cooled down, you can taste the saltiness in the dish. Other than that, the experience went really well. I would definitely come back again.",

We were a group of 12, with eclectic tastes, ranging from vegan to pure carnivore!! But, most of of us bonded over our quench for good alcohol.   We had reserved a table for 7.30p a couple weeks in advance. The fact that we were unable to budge our reservation even by half hour a week later, is testimony to the huge popularity of the restaurant.  They insist on a casual formal dress code, and I personally think it's more of a reminder for the \"man-kind\" ;)  Once we made it in, the ambience struck us as retro chic, with low lights and decent music, and packed tables... it's definitely what is called as \"vibe dining\".  We ordered several dishes, but the ones that left us asking for more were the shishito peppers and the smooth, la extraordinaire, lychee flavored cocktail, Asian pear!! The dessert, flaming Mt Fuji, was indeed the crowning glory as it was alit for our dear friend's milestone birthday!!   We all appreciated how we could pace ourselves, and enjoy our meal and company! Service was prompt and accommodating.  It's definitely pricey, but the memories we made were priceless..",

I made rsvp for my boyfriends birthday, we came in 25 min early so we chose to wait and sit at the bar for a drink. Armando the bartender was very nice and friendly! The bar is pretty unique with a set of Andrea's eyes lit up in bright colors displayed largely behind the bar wall. I requested with the hostess a private booth and she did accommodate us in one which was really nice!! Our server was also great but the greatest of all was the food! The chef sent over some small tomato bite to try as a compliment and it was delicious! Thank you for that!!  Everything we ordered was phenomenal. We also requested the vegan/vegetarian menu because it has really great selections!! We got the impossible burger sliders since we don't eat meat and they were delicious! Just like the real deal. I had let them know in advance it was his birthday and they brought custom chopsticks for him that said his name and Happy Birthday on them which is a really unique touch!! For dessert they brought the Mount Fiji flambeed cake that blew him away! We will definitely back again to eat again since we are locals! Pricey but nothing crazy! Our favorite  dish was the crispy tuna rice and shrimp sushi with mango and tuna on top! Cake has some alcohol in it which isn't my favorite but nonetheless delicious  enough cake for 4-6 ppl, we took the ret home for breakfast! Lol",

    "text": "I have eaten at Andrea's during a few different periods in my life: As a pescaterian  As an omnivore and finally...as a vegan.  And I can categorically say, that I enjoyed my meal the most as a vegan. The problem is, I am not willing to spend exorbitant amounts of money for ingredients (vegetables and grains) that simply do not warrant the price tag on the dish. At least I'm not willing to do that on a regular basis. I'm not going to rant about paying $X for a dish that would only cost $Y at home. Obviously, with high-end vegan dining at Andreas (and other similar establishments) you are paying for the experience.   But with three of us (2 omnivores; 1 vegan), the famous flaming desert, sake, lots of bottled water, two entrees (including one huge shared steak), and plenty of appetizers/sides, our bill came to over $450.  As much as I loved my dishes, I don't know that I'd be willing to spend any portion of amount on a semi-vegan \"experience\" very often.  BUT..... I have to admit the food was outstanding.  Two dishes were exceptional: KALBI PORTABELLO MUSHROOM and the VEGAN SPICY TOFU roll.  I was not as moved by: the BOK CHOY and the GINGER KABOCHA GYOZA  VEGAN SPICY TOFU ROLL: Everyone who tasted the roll --all fish/sushi lovers--said that this was one of the best rolls they'd eaten in a long time. The variety of textures and flavors in the roll would satisfy any sushi eater looking for a slightly lighter fare. We contemplated ordering a second roll for the table after devouring the first.    I am a fan of the food that Andrea's is putting out and I thoroughly enjoy their decor. I wish they'd do something about the music, but maybe that's just a \"me\" thing. This place makes you feel like the meal is special from the moment you walk in the door. And the personalized chopsticks will tickle any patron new to the establishment.   I really loved my meal and, by extension, the experience. I will be back.",

However, BEWARE of the steep prices here (which you expect because you are in one of the nicest hotels in Vegas).  I came here because my girlfriend wanted to try the punch bowl (a giant bowl of mixed drink). We got a bowl of showstopper and finished the bowl with 4 people. For $80 bucks (fairly steep for a pre-game), we all had a pretty good buzz that didn't require the usually \"shots shots shots.\" The showstopper was good enough that my girlfriend did not complain that this was too strong or undrinkable even though it was made with wild turkey.  Other than the punch bowl, we also ordered the wagyu beef sliders to share. These came out perfectly! I expected the sliders to be ordinary, but the taste and tenderness of the wagyu beef took me on a taste-bud-rollercoaster ride. The problem here is that the wagyu sliders were $24 bucks, which is EXTREMELY expensive!  I also want to mention that the service here was subpar, mostly because our server (Christian) was inattentive. When you are paying these prices, you expect world class service. (The edamame was $10 bucks!) After greeting us and pouring us water, he was nowhere to be seen for the next 25 minutes. To add fuel to the fire, I clearly saw him walking around and helping out the other tables, all of which were right next to ours. However, he basically pretended not to see us because I was definitely waving my arms like an angry monkey (just imagine that for a second...). Anyway, I did not knock Andrea's for this one server's incompetence or prejudice, but this is something you should be aware of before you open your wallets and decide to indulge at Andrea's.",

At first I thought she was joking, but then some older guy gave me a condescending smirk and told me, in a snotty, sarcasm tone \"To have a good night.\" Not what I wanted to hear or how I expected to be treated from employees at the Wynn.

If you sit behind the seafood platter you can't even see what's on the other side of the platter you literally have to stand up. It was very awkward. Besides that drinks were not balanced and the chow mein I think it was was soooooo greasy and disgusting. Even the har gow was not even good. You would think for the price this restaurant would be amazing but nope it wasn't. I did like the decor it was beautiful and our server was really kind and was always present.  CONS: Food, price, seafood platter presentation, sushi PROS: Decor, ambiance, service",

But later that night I had really bad food poisoning from the fish (it was he only thing I had that my girlfriend hadn't). I was really sick for days. I went the next day to inform the manager since I was close by and he just didnt care. He didn't care what dish it was or when it happened, didn't even apologize. He just said we could fill out a complaint form in the lobby if we wanted. I'm disappointed a 40 dollar fish got me that sick and the manager didn't care, as if it's something that happened there often. Needless to say that meal ruined my whole trip.

We had a reservation time of 9:45pm, when we walked in the restaurant was absolutely packed!!! The hostesses greeted us immediately and asked us if we would like to have a cocktail first in the lounge, we did just that and some what a great atmosphere and vibe.   We were escorted to our table and sat approximately 10:03pm, not a bad wait considering how busy it was. Our server was spot on and recommended that we begin with a sushi and sashimi platter, I have been in F&B for year and rarely take pictures of food but had to and will attach to this post. The sushi is right there with Nobu, Sushi Roku, Yellowtail i.e. it was outstanding in presentation, flavor and grade \"A+\"!  Our server then insisted we try the NY Strip we ordered three and they could have been the best thing I have smelled coming through a dining room in a very longtime. The group sitting next to us even asked what we had ordered so we shared a piece and they ordered the NY as well. My fiance ordered the lobster entree unbelievable presentation. Our friends had ordered a variety of seafood dishes, crab fried rice, rock shrimp, ponzu broccoli and stir-fried Japanese eggplant. We are definitely coming back not just for the amazing food and service but this wasn't your typical vibe dining restaurant much more chic and comfortable.",

The place is beautiful and elegant, with a cool retro/art deco feel to it -- the waitstaff are all very professional and friendly.   We started with some cocktails -- I had their version of a margarita, which I ended up having 3 of us because they were so good! Not too sweet.  Since we had a pretty big group I asked the waiter to put together a \"chef's choice\" menu and they did not disappoint.  So many highlights to cover here...but for appetizers, the shishito peppers were a standout, as was the wagyu beef tartare (so beautifully prepared!) and the tuna + crispy rice.  We had a few sushi rolls that were quite tasty and beautifully prepared, as well as the lobster tempura, which was just spicy enough to deliver a kick. We also had the brussels (excellent but could have been crispier) and some really well-prepared fried rice.  The shining star of the meal was the sea bass -- so buttery, melt in your mouth, flavorful, everything.  Didn't try the dessert, but will definitely need to the next time I'm back in Vegas. Highly recommend this place and will absolutely be back!",

The staff was very helpful and professional - always makes bland food better.   Drink menu was on an iPad, which although cool, seemed strange. The place is so dim lit, you could tell who was about to get hammered from the bright iPad screen. I was one that gave in an tried an under-poured martini for $12 - OUCH.   We ordered the peppers as an appetizer. Just bland, with a burst of spice from the mustard.   Then I proceeded to order the Duck Lo Mein.   I was very, very excited to see duck on the menu. When my dish arrived, it was a very large proportion. I almost couldn't finish! But the Lo Mein was so....bland....(like this review?)...that I felt like I could have gotten better at the buffet. The duck in the lo mein did not stand out at all. Was hoping for a burst of flavor, but I was unfortunately let down.   My partner ordered sushi and dim sum. He said it was good, but had the same reaction...bland.  Overall, Andrea's had so much hype - but for the Wynn - this was nothing more than \"OK\" food that came with a hefty ($100 for 2) price tag.  I suggest skip it.",

It was one of the best oysters I've tasted here in town. For the entree, we ordered the sizzling pork sisig. The serving is enough for two people to snack on. It was really good. They also brought everything we ordered really fast. After the bar, I walked inside the restaurant to see how it looks like. It's very modern-looking and the hostesses were really nice and professional. I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and I'm looking forward to coming back again.",

We went it late at a Fri night 8/24 since we were juz arrived in Vegas that night. So we had to order in the late night menu. The sushi rolls we got were pretty amazing, the cocktails -- sinatra smash and my passion fruit mocktail though i added patron tequila tasted so delish.   Our servers were great and very friendly. One the most stood for me, Christopher, because he recommended which clubs to go and the best nights when to go and suggested foods that would go great with our drinks. He was super friendly.   I would go back again..",

The service was extremely attentive, even to the point where my water glass was never emptied past the halfway mark.   The ambience is nice and I really liked the clientele of this place. People who eat here dressed impeccably. One thing to note is that they play music that is clearly audible and while it adds to the positive vibes, it may interfere in your conversations somewhat.",

We came here with a big group of girls and it was perfect the venue was perfect as we were able to chat across a big table without talking over too loud music. The shrimp pad Thai was awesome and a unique presentation. The rock shrimp tempura was literally to die for! So yummy. All the rolls we had at the table were also delicious. We all indulged in the lychee martinis which were perfect. We ended the night with the biggest dessert ever! I don't know what it's called but it's a giant tower of cake, mouse, chocolate, whipped cream and lit on fire! I highly recommend this place and plan on returning.",

    "text": "This place just isn't very good. We came here last night for my girls birthday dinner and were expecting at least good quality food but instead I got what felt like over priced Panda Express mixed with subpar sushi from a food truck. The service was ok they did come around often but words can't describe how disappointed I am with coming here. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and she ordered the crispy noodle with chicken. When they brought her plate out I literally looked at it and thought they had just opened one of those ramen bags you buy at a. Grocery store and dumbed some frozen chicken and veggies. Also mine was about as much onion and fennel as anything, by the time I was done with my chicken I still had a full plate of onion. Forget about the price of you come to Vegas you should know it's going to be expensive but spending 100 dollars on two tiny disgusting plates is not how you get people to come back. I'm staying at the encore and have been delighted by other places in here but I'll never recommended anyone to try this place.",

I had a date with a lovely lady here who just happened to be a biggest diva in the world but anyhow I digress, even she loved this place. I love the decor of this place, very friendly staff and unrivaled food for the  price. I always have to break the white Tony Montana when I come here. I will be back to this restaurant/bar when I get back to Vegas. Thanks again Andrea's.",

The Brussels sprouts were also a party for my taste buds. We also ate the flowers on the plate ,everything  is edible.  Oh ya, can't forget to tell you about The  Boba  Kai drinks .If your in the mood to get tipsy and have something unique in your mouth then try this drink. Hey, it Vegas we all want something unique in our mouths. They have tons of these jellies in them and you will get a bunch with each sip. Don't forget to eat the flowers too. It's better than a breath mint.  We made the waiter try it because he was shocked when we ate them. He actually brought us more, then tried one.. That's all she wrote!!",

I ended up ordering the stir-fry shrimp course along with a side of smashed potatoes. I have to say that the food was outstanding! Andrea's is expensive, but unlike many pricey restaurants on the Strip, they delivered top quality. I left impressed and would recommend the restaurant highly based on my experience there.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place with my husband. We had some time to kill before watching a show.  You definitely need reservations for dinner (not sure about lunch) and the doctor is posh with great ambiance. The host was super sweet and offered for us to sit at the bar where they serve a full menu.  We were met by a genuinely sweet bartender named Marv. He was super helpful and made me a yummy passionfruit mocktail since I can't drink at the moment. Marv made great suggestions about dinner and his service was friendly and attentive. The food took a little longer than expected but I know Marv kept checking to see if it was almost ready. He made great conversation and recommended a few shows and nightclubs. The whole experience at this restaurant was pleasant and the food was so delicious! I ordered items from the Vegan menu: edamame, chow noodles and an avocado/asparagus roll. My husband ordered steak and bok choi. Everything tasted really fresh and savory. I love it when a good meal leaves you feeling satisfied. Thanks again to Marv because he really gave great service! Define key coming back here again. The experience was impeccable.",

Call me weird but i have a thing for nice and cool bathrooms and this just isn't nice or cool.  service wasn't that great, it was good, but not great. our food took an incredibly long time (the table next to us also a party of 4 finished eating while we were still waiting and they arrived after us) no one came over to excuse themselves for the wait. but the chef did come out to talk to my husband about his food allergies which was a nice touch!  now onto the food.  we each ordered a couple things and all tried each others dishes - my dish seemed to have been the favorite of the night. the shrimp pad thai... out of this world!  the ice cream cone dessert was just ok. cute presentation but eh on the taste factor.",

We have been to so many asian fusion places in NYC and they just don't work...This really works! We had delicious hamachi, tempura shrimp, Miso Cod (!!!). Mo pu tofu - was interesting. Service was also really great - our waiter gave us a flight of Saki so we can taste different kinds. And the drinks were wonderful!!! Amazing actually. We love the personalized chopsticks....",

We had reservations for 10pm - but got here around 9.30 , and they were flexible enough to get us in early.  Since we'd informed them that we are vegetarian, they told us that they could make anything we wanted without the fish or the meat. We ordered the veggie rolls for starters and had their spicy fried rice and pan fried noodles. It was delicious. We were too full for dessert , but were tempted into the chocolate orange sphere and I'm so glad we ordered - it was a piece of heaven in your mouth. Since it was my birthday, they also brought a complimentary orange sorbet and a little cupcake with a candle on it. That was the cherry on top. As a little token, they also gifted me chopsticks with \"Happy birthday From Andreas\" inked on them...it was such a sweet gesture! Loved the place, totally worthy of 5 stars (just because I can't give them any more) , will surely visit again.",
