I needed to eat gluten free, they were more than ready to accommodate that. The servers were super nice, the food was delish, and yeah, did not disappoint at all. Kinda felt guilty for ordering the sweet and sour chicken for each of the three (or was it four?) different times eating there. Safe, worry free for me, couldn't ask for more :)",

    "text": "Normally, I'm a fan of PF Changs. This experience was quite mediocre.   I guess it's because they will get tourists no matter if they're good or bad being on the strip. That is disappointing--I will highly recommend you go somewhere else. You have so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. Even Panda Express if you want Chinese-ish food down the street. If you have access to a car, head over to Chinatown for some good authentic food.  A few unforgiveables here--my tea was lukewarm. That's awful for any restaurant. No one served our soup--another thing that servers do even in the ghetto-ist of Chinese restaurants.... Our server was kind of a ditz as well.   Sigh... I know I will be back at PF Chang's. Just not this one.",

The drinks that were ordered had to be sent back because they were horrible, maybe because they were using the wrong measure. It then took another hour to get our food, which it did not all come out at the same time. We were told that the drinks were going to be taken off our bill, that didn't happen. All we got was a sorry and a free slice of chocolate cake for my son that turned 14 years old today! Then we had to wait another 45 minutes for our checks! We were there for a total of 4 hours! Everyone's food was good but the service SUCKED.  Everyone that was in our party are good people and believe that you should treat people the way you want to be treated we all paid our bill in full and most of us still left a tip, but I know that tomorrow we will be calling the corporate office to make sure that they know that we were not satisfied! Unless you like frustration I do not recommend eating at the P.F. Chang's.",

Service was okay but nothing memorable.  The Plum sauce for the Crab Rangoon's was good though.   If you are gambling in Planet Hollywood and need some place to grab a bite, Id say check this place out.",

    "text": "We had such an amazing experience at this location. First of all we saw it walk the strip and turned around to head in for Happy Hour to get some food and cocktails. It was 4:30pm on Wednesday and we were sat right when we walked in. Our server was Ozzy and I cannot say enough good things about him. First of all he is an outgoing and very friendly guy. He gave many recommendations for both food and drink and we took his advice and ordered: spicy tuna roll, chicken lettuce cups, Singapore noodles, organize agave margarita and Asian pear mojito. He was personable and made us feel like friends not customers and made sure we knew about the PF Changes rewards program, which if you haven't signed up for you should ask your server next time you are in. We did not like the Singapore noodle dish because it has a very strong curry flavor which we are not fans of. When Ozzy noticed we didn't like it he apologized and without even our asking he brought over the manager and they took it off our bill. What a surprising treat their customer service is! They made sure we were happy with everything else and offered to make another dish if we wanted. We ended up ordering another spicy tuna roll which was AMAZING, thus the reason we ordered 2 of them. The happy hour menu is a great deal. We had 2 rounds of drinks and all that food and our bill was only$60 for Vegas that is crazy. After spending $250+ last night with terrible service and mediocre food we were more than thrilled with our experience here! I highly recommend this PF Changs location and request Ozzy as your server.",

    "text": "I know what you're thinking. \"You went all the way to Las Vegas just to eat at P.F. Chang's?!\"  The answer is yes, but let me explain.  My boyfriend and I were in town while my parents were also there. On some level I guess you could call them high rollers. That's different than being a baller. A baller would drop bills at a really fancy place. Not my parents, although they're not cheap either. Oh, and my grandmother was in Vegas too. She's cool, but simple. Nothing too flashy.  That's where P.F. Chang's comes into the picture.  It's a nice balance of fancy decor and unscale-ish food.  This is a big restaurant with a second floor.  That's where we sat and it was nice to be above the din of the casino.  The prix fixe menu is awesome. That's what Tyler and I chose. Two people get 4 courses for $45.  It turned into a lot of food and everything came out just as it should have (hot and well timed).  My only complaint would be about the batter on the shrimp, but I guess that's to be expected at a chain Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "This was the worst and only bad experience that I've ever had at P.F. Chang's. After browsing the menu, my friend and I discovered that it would be advantageous for us to order the P.F. Chang's For Two, because it included everything that we wanted to order and would be cheaper than ordering everything separately. Our server interrupted me while ordering and stated that it was too much food for us (unaware that we were going to order that much food anyway) and tried to discourage us from ordering that. The entrees come with white or brown rice, but we asked if we could pay an upcharge to get fried rice, which has never been a problem at other locations. Initially, our server said that we could do that, but then later said that we'd have to order an entire side or entree of fried rice. Maybe this is the restaurant's policy, so no fault to the server there, but it is a terrible policy and they should rethink that. We settled for brown rice, but we were given white rice because they were supposedly out of brown rice. Number one, you don't give someone something that they didn't order just because you ran out and assume that they'll be okay with it. Number two, this would have been a good opportunity to offer us fried rice as a substitute since that's what we really wanted. We also asked for extra crispy noodles for our soup. The soup comes out with no crispy noodles at all, so we had to ask for those. In the meantime our soup gets cold. Drink refills were slow. Both of our drinks emptied several times. Often he walked past our table with a pitcher of water, but didn't stop to refill our glasses. One time he refilled my glass, but not my friend's glass, even though they were both empty. The only positive thing that I can say is that he is honest, because I had more money on my gift card than I thought I did, and he returned the unnecessary cash that I gave him. I will not be recommending P.F. Chang's to any of my friends that are visiting the Las Vegas Strip. The only reason that I'm giving three stars is because the appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and entrees (crispy honey chicken and Mongolian beef) were delicious. The other two stars would've been awarded if we had good service.",

Love the scallops and fried rice with shrimp here. Nice and spicy on the scallops. The interior is great too. Most PF Chang's feel too large and cavernous. This one feels 'just right.' Service is great here too. They have a huge wait staff and are very attentive. They totally messed up drink order once, and just gave us a bunch of free drinks. It says a lot about the management, if you ask me, to have a stand out restaurant from such a lousy chain. Their prices are ok. Kinda steep, but welcome to Vegas, right? The wait times can be absolutely a turn off. We were told one day it was about 90 minutes. Next! But if you get there right when they open and eat dinner at a senior citizen time, you're in luck. A surprisingly decent place, very unexpected. I wouldn't visit it in my home area, but here, not bad!",

This dish is usually amazing. The sweet and sour chicken was not crispy but soggy.  Again this dish is usually amazing but was terrible. The Thai pate was tasty. We enjoyed the lettuce wraps. Our favorite was dessert. The fried bananas were delicious. Kids loved the coconut pineapple icecream. Hopefully we get a different cook the next time we eat here.",

    "text": "We had a large group and were celebrating the day after our friend's wedding.  We were fortunate to get one of the private rooms on the back so we could enjoy catching up without the noise of the other diners.  Our waitress right off the bat acknowledged us and welcomed us but she definitely seemed annoyed.  We aren't a rowdy group so every time our server, Tiffany, left we were like, \"Did we say something?\"  She came off as very passive aggressive and when we would ask for extras or request water she wouldn't acknowledge that she heard us so we would repeat and she would say, \"In a minute please\" with a forced smile.    At the end of the meal she didn't bring us fortune cookies even though there was a child in our group that mentioned how much she loved the fortune cookies while Tiffany was in the room.  As we were all leaving the restaurant we all grabbed a cookie from the front desk where Tiffany was standing.  She replied, \"Oh, I forgot to bring you cookies.  Sorry\"  with the same forced smile.  Her off-putting demeanor really put a damper on our dining experience.  Although she didn't do anything way out of line, she didn't do anything to go above and beyond and made us feel like we were making her life difficult.  PF Chang's is always good but there are so many places in Las Vegas that provide better service it may be worth it to skip this place and try something new.",

We ordered three dinner entrees which included the pad Thai chicken, honey walnut shrimp with melon balls and the Chilean sea bass with mushrooms and veggies.  The Chilean sea bass was amazing, as was the walnut shrimp.  The pad Thai noodles were tasty, but the chicken was a bit tough and chewy.    This location is always super busy but we had a great waiter, Ricky, and he took excellent care of us.  The service was great, the food was pretty tasty.

Growing up in the San Gabriel valley surrounded by real Chinese food I sometimes wonder if I'm allowed to enjoy this candy-like addicting concoction they serve here as food.  Proper or not, I like PF Chang's!  Although it's not the best food, it's tasty and it sure makes my mouth happy.  I mentioned in my previous blog that mom was visiting from Korea.  We went to Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood.  While my hubby was playing poker, mom and I decided to eat at the PF Chang's located inside the hotel.  It is here that my mom's obsession with this restaurant starts all over again.   We always order the Garlic Noodles.  We LOVE this dish.  We also ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps that we enjoy.  We sat out in the patio and blissfully soaked in the fair weather while munching happily on our lunch.  Even our strange & annoying server who kept complaining to us about her other table of customers and kept trying to overcharge us (I had to tell her to fix our bill twice) couldn't ruin our meal.",

    "text": "On a Sunday afternoon, we were buffeted out and Dennys was a long wait. Remembering positive P.F. Chang's experiences, we gave it another try.   The visit started off positive, when there was no wait to get in. We sat in an elevated booth, with a good view of the football game on TV.   I was satisfied with the shrimp lo mein, and shrimp fried rice. I had one gripe with the won ton soup. I felt that a bowl that serves three people was short on won ton.   In my opinion, this is a restaurant that is ideal for eating with others. It seems that popular Chinese food staples including fried rice and won ton soup are only served in family size portions.  The visit ended off positive. One day we'll probably return here when my family is in town.",

We tried a few places but they all had a two hour wait. We go over to PF Changs which had an hour wait so we put our name down. Out of nowhere a bartender comes downstairs and says there are seats at the upstairs bar we can sit at, and we wouldn't need to wait. SCORE!! That's what I call being in the right place at the right time.... We head upstairs and order our drinks plus our food. The bartender was very nice and had great customer service. We were able to have a few drinks, eat, and still make it to our show on time.   I give this bartender 5 stars.... And we gave him a hefty tip! The flying kiss in my profile picture is for people like him.",

I was the only one at the bar. What I liked: the consistent menu choices The bartender The Mongolian Beef What I didn't like:  Very noisy place Sushi - only average Sake selection - limited Staff - there is service elevator right next to the bar. The staff hangs around this area, talks loudly, and seemingly are oblivious that patrons are trying to enjoy their meal. Some serious training and management oversight is needed here.  I love PF Changs, but this is my least favorite one.  Ps: Yelp reviews are biased toward paid advertisers.",

It was our last meal in Vegas before we had to Pack and go to sleep for our flight back to Buffalo the next morning, so we just enjoyed it (It was my first time actually being in a P.F. Changs).  We walked in and we were sat down, For our Appetizer we started off with a bowl of Egg Drop Soup (Egg Whites cooked in Chicken Broth) when it came out it was an Emperor Sized Bowl, The bowl was huge it was delicious and I'm glad they added some bite sized carrot pieces for Texture. Then we ordered some drinks, I got the Coconut Lemon Sour (Pearl Coconut Vodka, Coconut Water and Fresh Lemon Juice) Very Refreshing, something to sip on in a Beach Chair (somewhere Tropical like Hawaii). My dad just got a Plain Margarita with a Salted Rim (he said its his favorite drink).  For our Entrees Dad got the Pepper Steak - Flank Steak, Bell Peppers and Onions marinated in a Black Pepper-Garlic Sauce (Steak was nicely done, I didn't care that much for the Peppers and Onions and we both thought it was a little Salty).For my Entree I got the Sichaun Scallops - Scallops breaded, fried and then coated in a Red Chili Pepper-Garlic (Perfectly Cooked, Nice Crispy Breading and a good amount of heat from the Sauce). Then I ordered another Coconut Lemon Sour and Dad ordered another Margarita, Service was Terrific, Food was Pretty Good (My first ever eating at P.F. Changs and I had a pretty Good Time), not to mention that this was my last meal in Vegas (for a While). Less than 4 Years from now I'll be return back tasting more of what Las Vegas has to Offer, Who Knows ?",

One friend lives in Henderson and the other Summerlin so we always met halfway at the Paradise location. That location is no longer open so we went to the new one at Town Square which opened in November. Plenty of time to work out any kinks. I suggest to never dine here. The A/C was barely working. It was so hot that we ended changing tables on to the other side of the restaurant. Took forever to get drinks, water, food etc. The service was beyond terrible. If you ever go to Chang's, it's either Summerlin or The District. This location was a joke.",

We got there about 4 p.m. and were told that it was about a 45-minute wait. The buzzer vibrated about 15 minutes later letting us know our table was available. The hostess was not all too friendly, maybe she was overwhelmed with the amount of people waiting for tables? Our waiter got to our table in a reasonable amount of time and took our drink order... we also ordered right away because with the amount of people in the restaurant, I was afraid that it would take him forever to come back and take our order. It was happy hour time and what I did notice at this location is that happy hour prices are about $2 more than any of the other locations in Las Vegas and Henderson. If I'm not mistaken the entire menu is also higher priced than the other locations. Our happy hour appetizers came out in spurts.. it took about 15 minutes to get our first appetizer after ordering and another 10 minutes to get the second appetizer. We didn't eat them because we wanted to eat it all together with our main entrees which came about 15 minutes later except for one dish that  was missing because our waiter said he misunderstood and didn't include it in the order. He said he would have it out shortly and it probably took about seven minutes to get it back to the table but it was nice and hot and fresh in fact all of our food was nice and hot and fresh even after sitting and waiting for a while they were still at a good temperature. All in all a good dining experience and we would probably be back more often if it weren't for the parking situation.",

    "text": "Ok, we have not been there for a while. The last time we went, this particular location was on Paradise & Flamingo Road. Food quality, flavor and service was excellent.  We discovered last night that they had relocated to the Town Square on Las Vegas & Sunset.  We had a couple of friends in from California and so we agreed to meet there.   So, first of all the actual facility is pretty bland. Not as picturesque as other P.F. Changs we have been to. It was all glass, black lacquer and tables that are blocky and squashed together. We really hated the seating, as it felt like we were sitting right on top of other parties next to us and behind us.  Next our server was pretty bad. He was personable enough, but kept forgetting our orders.  We asked for water and lemon, he brought us water.  We asked for straws once, then again, and again - it took a while before we got straws. Two of us had to ask for our drinks a second time - a simple iced tea and Shirley Temple.  We ordered pot-stickers (pork and shrimp) after about 15 minutes, we got a single order of pork ones. The shrimp ones never came and our server told us we only requested one order.  It was a long drawn out process ordering them and then he forgot, but told us we never requested them. By that time our food was finally on the table, so we let the pot-sticker issue go.  The food arrived and compared to other P.F. Changs, it was mediocre. The Mongolian beef was tough and the Crispy Honey shrimp was soggy... Not at all tasty compared to other P.F. Changs. I would say the move to this new location was not a good thing. The quality and service have definitely gone down. Giving them 3 stars, only because I can't give 2.5. But I truly felt this experience was closer to a 2 than a 3. Shame cuz we really like P.F. Changs.",

We started with Cecilia's Shrimp Dumplings (Served pan-fried or steamed, drizzled with a light chili sauce). I guess the default is steamed because our waiter didn't ask and that's how they arrived. Anyway, they were actually really tasty and the \"light chili sauce\" is quite good (albeit not spicy at all).  For our main, we went with the Street Noodles (Thin rice noodles, light curry sauce, shrimp, chicken, julienned veggies). Again, I was very, very impressed with the food. Although it was also lacking in spice, the dish contained a number of flavors that worked really well together and I should also mention that the shrimp was plentiful.  We also got a special Mai Tai for two in a Tiki glass and this thing was *enormous*. The glass is about the size of a small child's head and whoever made the drink used a very heavy hand with the booze. It was pretty great.",

I ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken. You know them, we've all eaten them, and when properly prepared are absolutely delicious. I was so grateful that the bar had open seating before we went to the club, I wasn't braced for how bad that taste was going to be. It wasn't bad per say, it was flavorless, the absence of flavor vs a bad one. I have managed to avoid this PF Chang 2/3 times that I have visited Las Vegas, I will learn to trust my instincts a little better next time.",

Their kitchen is by the front/door waiting area. Servers were coming out of kitchen yelling to move out of the way to the clients that were waiting to get seated. Just terrible! Some restaurants that have long lines seem to treat their clients as if they are not deserving to be able to dine at their  fine establishment. Rather go to a restaurant that respects the client and offers an experience that is a bit more pleasant. Don't settle for P.F. Chang's.  The food here is mediocre at best. I realize it isn't real Chinese food. The quality is more like a fast food style.",

    "text": "I have been to several PF Chang's locations, and this one 3-4 times while traveling for business. My experience here has been the standard positive PF Chang's experience. Located inside Planet Hollywood towards the very front of the casino.   PF Chang's as you likely know is a large semi upscale Chinese chain. Some people just don't like chains. I personally have no issues with chains that have consistently good food and service. To me, PF Chang's fits the category of good and consistent. Is it the best ever?  Probably not. But I find it reliable and quite tasty.   I love their crab Rangoon. Way better than most local Chinese places as PF Chang's actually uses more crab than cream cheese. I also like their version of shrimp with lobster sauce as well as salt and pepper prawns. The Chang's spicy chicken and sesame chicken is also always a hit with the family. My two daughters love their dumplings.   Having the choice of white or brown rice is always nice. And if you want to try their fried rice the combination fried rice is pretty darn good.   Yes, PF Chang's cost more than your typical local joint, but sometimes if you don't have a good referral, you are taking a chance with a local place. For consistency sake and the high quality, PF Chang's is tough to beat.",

Yes, every time I visit PF Changs, I hope it's as good experience as my first few visits and then I usually leave a little disappointed.   I ordered 3 items, and yes I know my eyes were bigger than my stomach but I wanted to try many items and they were on special.  I got the pork dumplings, 3 for $3.25, 6 crab wontons for $5, and lettuce wraps with chicken for $6.  I thought the dumplings were going to be like the ones at dim sum since they advertise it like that but it was they were more like potstickers steamed instead of fried.  The wontons were crispy and the filling was alright.  I did like the plum sauce that was served with the wontons.  There was a lot of chicken for the lettuce wraps.  I could barely finish 2, and was glad my husband was able to eat the rest of the chicken.  The service was good and the atmosphere is not bad, a little dark, but comfortable.  I would probably give it 3.5 if I could.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will likely try another restaurant for Chinese food.",

The ambiance is casual and relaxed, decor and menu are Chinese and Asian influenced with an expected range of dishes. Have visited P.F. Chang's in many cities. This location in particular has a lot to learn and improve. Menu is the same but dishes are not cooked in the same way. During our meal, we found food to be mixed. Chang Spicy Chicken was served with sweet chili sauce which is more usually featured in Thai cuisine but that was ok, the dish tasted not bad.  Kung Pao Chicken, which is a Sichuan style dish, was also pretty good. Chicken coating was interesting but we enjoyed the flavors of this dish.  The Orange Peel Beef was a bad serving. Dish was served luke-warm and with a thick sauce that tasted odd. Orange peels didn't complement the beef or heavy sauce well. This dish didn't make a lot of sense taste wise. We'd skip this one next time for sure. Dishes are Chinese and Asian inspired instead of authentic but that is ok.  Although the food was not bad, the atmosphere was lacking. I found it to be crowded and very noisy.",

The hot and sour soup was good, but not what you'd expect from typical hot and sour: this has a beef stock base, rather than chicken, so it isn't as light, but the flavor was good.

It was very disgusting, regardless if the cook washed his hands once he arrived to the restaurant kitchen,  it is still very disgusting for the fact that he didn't do it immediately after leaving the bathroom. You will never see me walk into a P.F Chang's again.",

I have never been in there and less than a 10 minute wait but also never more than 20 minutes and that is not because the staff was being lazy.  It's because they are busy and they are all working hard to flip the tables.  There is a great outdoor seating area that is my favorite in early winter or early spring.  It's cool at night but they have outdoor heaters that make it great to sit out there and people watch.  PLENTY to see as people walk by.  The service is usually great. Michael was our latest waiter and he was on top of everything. Drinks were served quickly and our glasses were never allowed to get empty   Our food was delivered quickly and was delicious. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and they were amazing.  The cost was very in line for the service and food you receive.",

The server also handed me the menu and didn't say anything. Although the waiter was kind, that's okay for now.  Sesame cucumber- under was soy sauce.. Really salty...  My entrees came and it tasted like the plates have been sitting there for seven minutes. Outside was warm/murky inside was a little hotter.  I ordered lo mein (chicken fried noodles) and coconut veggie curry.  Best was the curry but kinda salty and they give you a bowl of rice. With tips, Total was forty dollars. Blah.",

They informed us they were closing in about fifteen minutes. Although they were closing soon, they still graciously served us. George, our waiter, was a pleasant delight. He was attentive throughout the meal. Our glasses were always filled with water and our silverware and dishes were clean. The food was served hot and nicely arranged. The Pad Thai had phenomenal flavor and the fried rice was delicious. The Sesame Chicken was flavorful too. Our large group had a fabulous time at P.F. Changs.",

This restaurant is disgusting! My wife already did a detailed review and posted both pics and video of the mess in this establishment. I will add to it and say that none of the mess on the table next to us was moved until I had to ask for it to be done and received glaring eyes from the waitress upon my request. It seems all of the staff there and the manager seem it acceptable to leave tables filthy, with food particles on the tables and floor.   My wife asked for me to get her food to go as she up and left the restaurant. I stayed and ate my meal, which was a mistake as I developed digestive issues about an hour later. I'll spare you the details. So if the seating area is filthy imagine what the kitchen is like!",

My only gripe is that I called in for a take-out order and eat in my room.  I phoned in and they said it'll be ready in 15-20 minutes.  I get there at the time they said and I paid.  I waited an extra 30 minutes.  Almost an hour to get my food.  What?  And the best part?  I tried ordering a soda and the cashier for the take-out.  He still wanted to charge me almost 4 bucks for a soda.  No complimentary soda after standing in front of you for almost 30 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready?  Whatever.  It's not like the take-out line was super busy either.  I like this place out of convenience.  I think they deliver to your room too?  But I don't want to mess around with the service fees/taxes/every other fee they tack on.  Stop being lazy and pick it up and eat while you're getting ready for a night out!  Unless you want to eat there too.",

The food we ordered included lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles (not on the menu), broccoli beef, kung pao chicken, and Mongolian beef.  My hubby also had a cup of hot & sour soup,  We all loved our food!  An employee working on a new dish they created brought us a plate of the food, and asked us if we wanted to try it, which we did.  (it was a salad with peanuts in it, but I don't recall the name).  We each ordered cocktails, and those were delicious as well.  I hope to return here again some day when visiting Vegas.",

Make a reservation if you have more than 2 people in your party .  It gets very busy .",

We ordered the honey chicken, salad, and two starters and tea - costing not much more than $50US.   Our waitress was fantastic and very friendly, checking in on us every now and then.  Highly recommend P.F Chang's for anyone visiting Vegas.",

I had the Mongolian beef and the king pao chicken.  Both were good but I would have liked the king pao a bit more spicier.  Entree dishes cone with choice if white or brown rice.  Other people in group had some sushi and they loved it so much they ordered a sack d helping. Now what sets this place apart is that they accommodated our big group of about 9 people in a private room.  Also our server Lee was beyond awesome.  Kept checking on us, refilling our waters and had a great sense of humor.  He made the night for sure.",

    "text": "Yeah so I'm doing a review on a chain restaurant,  which I don't normally like to do too much but I have to review the worse experience I've ever had here unfortunately.  I work at Planet Hollywood and frequently eat lunch at this location at least once a week.  Food is decent and service is usually pretty good and it's convenient from the offices that I work at upstairs.  Since I dine at this location regularly , I've signed up for the rewards program and once in a while get sent offers for buy an entree and get an entree free.   Since several of my co workers also get these offers we usually take advantage of this by ordering 2 entrees and getting the 2 free so a total of 4 entrees.  We know this is a lot of food but we're ok with having leftovers for lunch the next day.  For at least a year we have both been using our coupons and getting 2 full sized entrees with split checks between 2 people, there was also a time we did it with 3 people and 3 entrees.  All 3 people paid full price and received an additional entree free just as the coupon states.  We have never had an issue in the past year but for some reason a sever that I've never noticed before was so rude and condescending that he would not allow us to do it.  Once explained that we've been doing this for at least a year he was so snarky and said \"you get free lo Mein every time you come here?\"  I was annoyed by his rude and smart ass remark that I calmly said to him, \" no, we use our offers here every time we get them without a problem, whatever the offer at the time may be\".   To make a long story short, we were so annoyed by the way the server spoke to us that we decided to leave, when I called the manager she brushed me off and said she just walked into her shift and was just made aware if the situation but I'm ore then welcome to call back in about an hour to speak with the manager that was on duty.  I declined, I decided to write a comment to corporate through the main website with no response.    It's very unfortunate that there are a lot of great servers at this location that we really like and never give us issues, but all it takes is one horrible experience to make me want to never return.",

There's usually a game on that my husband needs to watch. The food is always yummy. This time, we started with Edamame and moved straight into the Hokkien Street Noodles, something new for us.

It was somewhat busy, but after a half hour, most of the other diners had been served and left. Half hour in, the waiter apologized, saying that the kitchen was very busy, it would just be a little longer. Then a full hour in, the manager comes by. We are really hungry by now, it's 10:30 pm. He says he knows we've been waiting patiently & it would only be a few more minutes. You would think that a restaurant manager working at a restaurant with a reputation such as P.F. Chang's would at least offer us something to nibble on since we'd been waiting SO long. Apparently this manager missed the inservice on basic customer service. After looking at my phone and seeing that it was 11 pm, & realized we ordered 90 minutes ago, my buzz woke off, my hunger grew, & my patience was gone, as were we. I got better service at Panda Express than I did here tonight at P.F. Chang's!",

He kept checking on us and telling my boys age 5 and 7 \"I have a surprise for u\" (\"eat ur food so u can get ur surprise\"). I asked for our check and told the waiter I have to meet someone and I need my check. He asked me please wait 5 mins so the boys can get their surprise. I agreed. He came back with a tray that had 4 different types of desserts asking my boys to pick up whatever they like. My 7 yrs old took a chocolate cake. My 5 yrs old was about to take another cake but I stopped him since I don't give sugar to my boys that late at night. I told them to share but waiter was insisting that my 5 year old should get his own. I thanked him and told him no. He then gave me the check charging me for the cake. What the hell??? If I wanted to order dessert for my boys I would. Telling me to wait because he has a surprise for my boys then charge me for it wasn't right. I didn't say anything to him since I was sitting with my boys. WHAT THE WAITER DID WASN'T RIGHT.",

    "text": "Okay...this P.F. Chang's is very fortunate that I am giving it an okay review instead of downgrading it lower. Their saving grace is that the food is very good in which I had lobster fried rice with shrimp and also vegetable rolls for an appetizer. Tasted great and the portion allowed me to have it for an extra day. Another thing that saves them is that my wait time for a table was only about 5 minutes when I was originally told it would be 15-20. Thank you for seating me earlier than expected....  So why am I prompted to give a lower review you may ask...well despite being seated earlier than what I was told...it was the reverse of my order being taken. It took upwards of around 35 minutes...yes 35 minutes for my order to be taken. Mind you the time I was at P.F. Chang's it wasn't super busy, there were 2 other parties ahead of me, one of 2 and the other of 4 that got their orders taken before me and there after food. I had to ask 3 different people who worked there where the waiter was to take my order if there was a manager around so I can let them know that my order had not been taken yet. Luckily Justin, after taken a few orders decided to take my order after I was voicing my displeasure a little bit more vocal. Not sure if he was the one that was initially suppose to take my order. He said even before I uttered the words that he wasn't the one that was suppose to. I want to believe him cause he seemed like a cool guy and suggested my order also before I was set to order something else. Either way he apologized for me being overlooked (would had been nice if I just got a discount on the order overall being how long I had to wait) but either way it wasn't really costly so, whatever I guess...If it wasn't for that wait P.F. would had easily gotten a 4 which really would had been a 4.5 if there were half points here but instead is 3 which because of the wait and no discount for the wait is really about a 2.6  Hopefully better luck next time P.F....if I go a next time.",

They use to be friendly and also offer different sauces for your meal as well as mixed them if you wanted mild,medium or hot. No choices were given and i had to request them. We ordered our meal and some appetizers(fried wontons) they were good. Thus the one star for them. But it took a while for our order to arrive. A couple of our dishes came out cold. The sever said no problem I'll be right back with hot dishes. Well no lie 8-10mins passed we had to flag down another server who said he'd get ours. Of course our rice is getting cold by now. 15mins later out comes our other dishes. I'm starving at this point so I overlooked the cold rice and dark bones of my ribs (which indicates Old meat)! I took a few bites. Packed up the left overs that were eventually thrown into the trash of the hotel room. And I'll never return there again. Go to Earls of Sandwiches if you want friendly service n hot food. That's my new go to eatery in Planet Hollywood Vegas now.",

This time I got a whole new order of sushi, and I took it to go.

Never apologized for the bugs or the delay. Then waited over 20 minutes for my replacement. Too long. I have visited over a dozen P F Chang's  around the country. This is the worst. And this was my second visit here. My first visit wasn't good either but I never wrote a review. This location is too reliant on casino traffic since people could literally fall from the casino into the restaurant. So I don't think they care about service or professionalism given they have so much easy traffic. They need to retrain the bar staff.",

    "text": "Came here with my fiance after hearing some good things about P.F. Changs. The atmosphere is very enjoyable but the food was mediocre, and the sushi is a huge disappointment. To start we ordered a california roll, which is a pretty standard sushi roll in North America. It was very cold, quite obviously pre-made and refridgerated. Totally not how a restaurant of any kind should serve sushi, and why we often avoid buying sushi at grocery stores. Our entrees were the honey chicken and lo mein noodles, which took 20 to 25 minutes to arrive, only because our waitress decided to \"check up on our food\". She brought it to us right away after that, and it was luke warm, which tells me it had been sitting for a while. Half way through eating it had become cold. The waitress asked if we would like to take a look at the dessert menu, and although I said yes, she never brought it and instead just brought our bill. I don't understand how someone can ask to sell you something more, and the buyer is willing, and then the seller doesn't deliver. What kind of business is that? After this experience, I don't think we'll be looking to eat sushi in Las Vegas for a while as we can get it for cheaper back home and a lot more fresh and tasty.",

The only reason I am not giving this restaurant a 4 or 5 star, is because I though the food was a little too salty for my taste and P.F. Chang's tends to have a limited Vegetarian menu. This was no big deal, because the next time we are in Vegas and nearby, I would eat here again.",

I was here just last week and they had no problem with this.

Another server dropped off the meal, the meal wasn't fully cooked. When I tried to cut it the knife wouldn't go through because it was undercooked. Again, Ketowie, was no where to be found. I called the restaurant again, asked that they send a supervisor to table 24. I was shocked when the manager asked if I tried to cut the other pieces to see if they were cooked. Maybe he thoughtI should only eat the food that was cooked and leave the rest of the uncooked food... what a waste of my time and patience. Don't eat here!",

    "text": "Came in early evening with my family of 5 for dinner. We were seated right away in a booth. Our host and waiter were nice and helped us out the whole time. He was great at remembering our orders (we ordered a ton of food) and was quick with refills.  The reason I gave 3 stars: the tables were still a little sticky and it's very crowded in there. It didn't affect my meal or comfort of the evening in any way but we heard two loud crashes and shattered plates and glasses, twice. That makes the employees and restaurant look bad. So my recommendation would be to make more room so that the guests and servers can actually walk around without bumping into people and/or dropping their food",

    "text": "So we were on our way to another restaurant further down The Strip when we realized we wouldn't make it in time because we were pressed for time with show tickets and still had quite a bit longer to walk to the other restaurant (The Strip is very deceiving distance-wise!). We ended up eating at the PF Changs and they were able to seat us right away and we sat outside on the patio. The patio area was nice because it was right on The Strip, but had an enclosed area to separate it from all of the crowds walking by.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, however, it did take awhile for our entrees to come out. He went back and checked on them and did apologize that it took so long for them to come out. Our water glasses were kept refilled, which was important given how hot Las Vegas was when we visited in mid-May.   I ordered what I usually order at P.F. Chang's which is the Crispy Honey Chicken. The dish was good, but I wasn't able to eat too much of it due to the delay in it coming out and having to run to get to the show. We also got the 6 hand folded crab wontons from the dim sum menu (I had a coupon for a free birthday appetizer or dessert). Overall a good meal; however, being in Vegas, I don't know that I would pick to eat at P.F. Chang's again if we weren't so pressed for time and it wasn't right there just because there are so many other dining options.",

So you would think that all locations would posess the same state of mind when it comes to customer service!  WELL I thought absolutely wrong!! I have eaten at this location a few times in the past year but nothing compares to the experience I had here just this October.  We sat at the bar and it was early bout 2:00 and it was a lil busy but not overwhelming.  The bartender was sooo FREAKIN rude right from the start.  We sat there for literally 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged he would just walk right by us like we were ghosts! Not even a courtesy \"I'll be right with you\".  So were like watever right and then this couple walks in 20 mins later and sits right next to us and the same thing happenes to them, Well when the lady asked the bartender if she could just order a drink this is wat the rude bartender said \"NO not right now...I'm only one person here!!\"  I was shocked!!  And so was the lady!!  Of course I butt in and told him he shouldnt be so rude and then he just totally lost it.  I got up and went to speak with the manager but he didnt give a shit either!  I Love PF CHangs but I will NEVER step foot in this inconsiderate location again!!",

I know its a large restaurant chain and you should get the same product no matter where you go but this one USED to be better. We we were seated our waitress let us know that they have had allot of changes. The staff was all polite, and we were seated quickly because we had a reservation (45 min wait without one so call ahead. We after we ordered our food came quickly and looking forward to my meal i was disappointed because i learned what all the changes had been on my first bight. This PF Chang's was now just like the other PF Chang's that i had been to not much flavor in the food ( if you are going to put a warning on the menu the the food is spicy make it spicy not bland. If you like other PF Chang's you will enjoy this one too if you like flavor in you food this is not the place for you.  Overpriced for what you get.",

I decided to be safe and go for their famous lettuce wraps. I have to say the food was actually decent. The meat sauce wasn't too strong and the lettuce was very crispy. Portions weren't big but just enough to fill me up. At $8.50, it was the only reasonable value on the menu. What irks me is the rest of the menu. Almost everything else costs twice as much as it should. I realize the prices are gonna be high since Vegas Strip+chain restaurant=$$, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it.",

It took forever for them to make it. We went to pick it up like 10 min after it was supposed to be ready and ended up waiting another 20 or so. But to top it off, they got the order wrong. We called and they said they would make what we were supposed to have real quick an bring it up to us. After close to an hour, we had finished eating what we did have and called to check on our missing food. They told us it should be up to the room in 20. When we said to keep it and refund us, they got all hissy and basically asked us why did we ask them to remake it anyway. We said because you told us it would be up \"real quick\"..  Over all, the food was blah to mediocre (i would have rather had panda versus pay the price of that crap) and the service was horrible. Spare yourself and go to Panda Express. Same thing but you'll be able to throw $15 extra on the tables .",

Our waiter instinctively knew when to show up and when to leave us alone.  he was there to refill drinks, take plates but never hovered our interrupted us while we were chewing.  Oh the food!!  *facepalm* -_- Seriously fire the chef.  I know it gets busy but the flavor and the food should not have to suffer.  The first thing we had were the lettuce chicken cups for an appetizer.  This was ok but very greasy.   My dish was the shrimp and vietnamese noodles.  The bowl came out looking the opposite of the picture in the menu.  The noodle were gray and way too much of them.  The shrimp and some type of meat protein were kind of hidden under the mound of noodles and were sparse and overcooked.  There was no flavor to this dish at all.  Bleh!  My friend ordered orange chicken and rice.  I had a bite.  Still no flavor.  Even the rice was bland which is weird because Asians flavor their rice with salt at least.  Whomever is heading the kitchen obviously does not care about p.f. Chang's cooking reputation or the food in general.    This experience was sad because #1. here is Las Vegas it is so very hard to find good Asian fusion food in general, and #2. It was my very first time at p.f. Chang's and sadly the last.  I will never eat here again.",

You're never going to leave here thinking this is the best food ever, but you shouldn't leave disappointed either.  We came for a very late lunch and mowed down a ton of food on the happy hour menu, which is a relatively good deal.  The one major knock on this location is the service was very mixed - our food came pretty quickly, but the waiter never made us sauce for our lettuce wraps, forgot my drink, and pretty much went AWOL half-way through our meal.",

Chang's twice while in Las Vegas - during our first visit, we explained that my wife has a gluten sensitivity and the staff went overboard to ensure she was well taken care of, from recommending their favorite gluten free items to ensuring she had gluten free soy sauce.  On our second visit, we were pulling a large wagon full of equipment (my wife and I are photographers and were working that day in the casino) and they ensured that we were sat at a table where our wagon would be safe from accidental kicks and that other patrons would not trip over it.  Once more, our waiter made excellent recommendations and we received wonderful service.  It was actually one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had.  I'd like to add that it's little things like this that make or break a trip.  We happened to be in Las Vegas for business that day, but the staff made us feel as though we were on vacation.",

My hubby and I come here every year on our wedding anniversary for lunch. (4 years total now). As soon as we land and check in to our hotel we come to P.F. Changs! The service is always pleasant and the place itself is wonderful. The decor is great and very clean. Here are some of our favorite dishes. Appetizers: The egg rolls are a must try. Very crispy and taste so good with the choices of sauces. We also enjoyed the pork dumpling and the chicken lettuce wraps. Oh let me not forget the northern style dry rub ribs which are absolutely delicious. Now for the main course. You must try the Mongolian Beef with pork fried rice. The beef is so tender you can't stop eating it. The drinks and beer are really good as well. I personally like the cosmopolitans. Trust me you won't be disappointed. They also have a happy hour where you can eat and drink for a great price. After you're done eating you can go right outside the doors into the Planet Hollywood Casino and have some fun. Overall this is one of our favorite places.",

At this point, people that were JUST walking through the door were being told they had a 15 minute wait....  WAIT GUESS: 40 min WAIT TOTAL: about an hour and a half  On top of this, the lady who was at the front desk should not be a front of house person, on top of having seriously bad time guessing skills (which is part of her job), she had horrid customer service skills.

The food was just what I wanted. I can not say enough good things about our visit. Waiter (I wish I remembered his name, Has tattoos, used to have an old scooter in Reno) He did an excellent job! He recommended wine and cocktails for us, was friendly (hence how I heard he used to have a scooter, He commented on my scooter tattoo) and still very professional and attentive. We had a great time and can not wait to visit again.  Also please tell corporate we want PF Changs back at the races! We missed you in 2012!",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a conference in June and just happened I had some PF Chang gift cards (two adding up to $35 worth) that have been in my wallet for some time.  My friends and I walked over to PF Changs from MGM Grand - Very walkable distance and great spot on The Strip.  We had to wait for 20 minutes for our table, but we were given one of those vibrating, light-flashing coasters to let us know when our table was ready, so we went outside to wait and people watch until our table was ready.  Awesome dry desert heat, interesting people, and view.  We got a great booth and the service was awesome.  I asked if I could apply both gift cards to our total bill and he said of course I could. Win! :) The meals were reasonably priced and took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table.  We all ordered something different and I was hankering for some noodles.  Not sure what I ordered but I think it was deep friend noodles that were then stir fried.  What was I thinking...Anyway, the sauce was thick and the meal sat heavy in my tummy.  The food wasn't super duper in my book, but then I've only had one dish there so far.  Nothing super spectacular about the food that we ordered but we loved the restaurant, location, and service.  You can't beat that!  Oops, wait.  My friend ordered a shrimp dish that was actually fresh and delicious looking.  I will definitely go to PF Changs again to give it another try and we have one here in Seattle.  Next time I will try something less fried.  It's definitely worth checking out if you are in Vegas for the experience, price, and decent menu.  I did love the iced tea, though. Very refreshing. :)",

    "text": "Don't even know where to start with this place. Service isn't usually something that bothers me that much, I feel like the ambiance and the food are the most important factors. In this case, I just couldn't ignore the service (or lack there of). To begin, we had a reservation and still had to wait for a table (understandable, but still).   We are finally seated, given menus, and order our drinks and the lettuce wraps since we know already we are going to want that. At this point we hadn't ordered our main dishes yet.   So we browse the menu, and decide what we will have as main dish. Our waiter however, is no where to be seen. In fact, we couldn't even flag down another server to call our server. We wait and wait and wait, and he finally appears with our drinks. We order our main dishes, and one of the girls in our group asks for sugar. He leaves, and nothing. No sugar.   He comes back a long time later with our lettuce wraps and when my friend asks again for the sugar he says coldly \"It is already on its way- I asked for it already.\" Woah there, way to be friendly! He also explains they only have one kitchen for two floors and that is why the food is taking so long. I'm sorry, that is not an excuse in my book. There are way bigger restaurants in New York City that are able to accommodate a big space with a full house.   Our food finally arrives, and our friend the waiter once again makes a snide remark when one of us ask for something. I understand you might be having a bad day, maybe lost your paycheck at the Blackjack table, but don't bring your problems to work, buddy!   The food itself was really good, we had Singapore Noodles which I kept serving myself more and more of. We also had the orange beef which was good but not my favorite, was slightly chewy. The black bean chicken was fantastic-- delicious! And of course you cannot go wrong with the lettuce wraps though we made a huge mess.   At the end, my lovely girlfriends had asked the waiter to bring out a Birthday Cake and even gave them candles they had previously purchased. Our dear friend walks out with the slice of cake with the candles, and proceeds to light the candles in front of our table and just drops it in front of us. The cake was pretty good, chocolate cake is my absolute fav, but the raspberry sauce was a bit too overpowering for me.   I definitely recommend going to one of PF Chang's other locations. I had a great time at the Atlantic City branch, complete opposite experience to the experience I had here. Get it together, PF Chang's!!!",

But if you don't eat meat, this is probably a good option in las Vegas, where I've found, options are quite limited. The lettuce wraps have a delicious filling, but they'd be better on romaine (not iceburg). The ma po tofu is a really big portion of both broccoli and spicyish orange sauce on crispy tofu; it's good but kind of heavy to attack by oneself. Everything is priced okay, but still, I wouldn't have gone here if it weren't for the terrible vegan options in Las Vegas.",

However, being vegan, in Vegas...my choices were a bit limited, so I ended up eating here twice.  No wonder this place is one of PETA's top 5 Veg-Friendly Chains! Both times I was there, the servers were extremely knowledgeable about what menu items were options for me, and tweaked items to make them vegan.   As previous reviewer said, there is no price mark-up here, which was a nice surprise.   If you're vegan, or visiting Vegas with someone who is, put PF Changs on your list of food options.",

Their food is good but I normally wouldn't come back to eat all the time if it wasn't for the lettuce wraps ::cue the heavenly angel singing::. I love their lettuce wraps and even though I could successfully mimic them at home I don't want to have to go through the mess of all the condiments to make the lettuce wrap sauce ::cue singing again::.   They also give you the choice between brown rice and white rice. I bet that excites you huh? I know, I just like the idea of being able to go to a Chinese restaurant and eating a light meal that's good for you. Service is good and so is the rest of the food (which is family size portioned) but the only thing that I ever get are the lettuce wraps. They have a choice of chicken or veggie (I prefer the chicken but they are both just as good). I like it. I like it a lot.",

    "text": "So, I went to this P.F Chang's for my birthday dinner this past Saturday with a group of seven people, including myself. I've been to a couple of different P.F Chang's around the valley and I always have a pretty good time. This time...not so good.   Our reservation was for 8:00p and I'm not going to lie, I am notorious for being late. By some birthday miracle, I made it to the place about two minutes after 8. I know, late is late, but when my boyfriend made the reservation they told him that ours would be given away if we were 10-15 minutes late...a little confusing, but whatever. We got our table just fine. Food and drinks were good as well.   Our waitress was nice, but she seemed aloof - which is not something I would hold against someone. What I did have a problem with is her whisking my food away that was barely touched. We were sitting in a U-shaped booth and I was turned to face the group to talk. I wasn't watching over my food(I didn't think I had to) and I had a couple of drinks, so I was definitely very into whatever I was talking about. I could understand that maybe she didn't want to interrupt me...personally, I would have preferred her doing that instead of just taking the food away without checking. My other friends weren't talking, so she could have asked them about it and they would have asked me. We spent $200 that night. That's a fortune to me and to leave with no leftovers when there was plenty....well, I consider THAT a dinner time atrocity. I know I should have said something then, but everyone was leaving so I didn't. I really should have because it's been bothering me! 9/10 times, I always eat my leftovers the next day. Wasting food is a huge pet peeve of mine...and in this situation it severely irks me because it was food that I was going to eat. Maybe a good solution would be to re-train that server and make sure all of the servers are on the same page.  A warning to all who choose to dine at P.F Chang's in Planet Hollywood: Make sure to keep a steady eye on your meal if you are like me and want to get the most for your money by taking the leftovers home.",

Pork ribs were dry. Sweet and sour chicken was what you expected and the pad Thai was good. They give you a bag full of condiments which I thought was wasteful and ended up bringing a bag of unused takeout utensils and 30 packets of soy sauce back to them. My date has a shellfish allergy so the menu was limited. However a manager guided us over the phone on what we could order which was helpful.",

The server was cool and friendly . We ordered hot and sour soup which was great. We then had the lettuce wraps which were below standards . The lettuce was wilted and the server said sorry but did not offer to replace. The spicy chicken and noodle dish was good. Sorry to say but the poor attitude takes away from the good food.PF Chang's has to step up its game to their front line people",

We decided to order a few of the happy hour apps, we got the calamari, pork egg rolls, and crab rangoons. I thought the egg rolls we're kinda dull on flavor but I enjoyed the others. I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce for my main dish with brown rice. I really enjoyed it! There were tons of shrimp and flavor. My Mom ordered the beef and broccoli with white rice. She said that she liked the dish and noted that the broccoli was not overcooked. I can't remember what my Dad got, but it was a steak thing that he scarfed down. We really enjoyed the food. The prices are high but it's something you treat yourself to.",

Had both those items and I don't know which of two triggered it but I'm not suffering from some pretty serious food poisoning. It sucks and completely ruined my trip. I should honestly do a chargeback for those meals as they were okay but not great. The chicken tasted burnt and smelled a bit funny. Taste wise left a lot to be desired. Poki bowl was good overall. Obviously the big issue though is the food poisoning. I can deduce it was here based off the fact I hadn't eaten for about a 10 hour period before hand and drank no alcohol, only water.  Edit: Down to one star because I reached out to PF Chang's directly as instructed and they failed to even reply. They simply comment here to create the illusion they wish to help when really they continue to ignore you. Won't be returning, terrible professionalism.",

The food came in fast and tasted fresh. Food is usually consistent at most P.F. Chang's and no difference this time around. You already know that Chinese food is saltier than most and oily. It also probably contains MSG which isn't bad at all, in fact, makes it more tasty!   Had a great experience at this restaurant. Service was fast and the drinks were refilled without any trouble.

Why is it so hard for places these days to serve Hot Food. Last time at the P.F. Changs on LV Blvd, the Bill was $200. And the food wasn't even warm when it got to the table. We had stopped going over a year ago, but thought we would give it one more chance to see if the quality of the food and service was any better than the last time we ate there. Sadly, it was not. The wait staff was good, but the food was cold again which it has been the last few times we have eaten there. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the ingredients they are using, I just don't know why they can't get the Food from the Wok to the Table fast enough so we can eat it whiles it's Hot. So we won't be going back anytime soon. DW.",

I was like an addictive foodie trying to catch the original flavor and quality of the food; to dissatisfaction. Waitress Jackie was on point and provided quality services; however, service did not supersede the quality of the food . The beef a la sichuan (flank beef) is not tender over cook and has a lot of sodium rather than flavor and tasted sweet. It was supposed to be spicy  not at all. The Singapore black pepper chicken was horrible and like the beef was supposed to be spicy. The signature dish magnolian beef  tuff salty over cooked. Don't bother",

Food The Chinese American food felt fresh and made when ordered.  Definitely a lot of salt in each dish as expected for Chinese food.      Service This is Las Vegas so the customer service is always top notch.  New plates and new silverware for every dish with the pre fixed menu.",

She didn't come back to the table at all to ask if my food was ok. I left her a nice side plate with my mushrooms on it picked out. The food seemed like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Noodles were dried and chicken was not juicy. So...poor service....nasty food. I would not eat here again! It's Vegas...there are tons of amazing places to eat with amazing food.

Food is delicious in this restaurant and the portions are generous. Restaurant has two floors. It is located in the Planet Hollywood's complex facing the Las Vegas Blvd. Lots of shopping is in its immediate vicinity.  I generally order the Chicken soup along with a spicy dish such as General's chicken and/or King pao chicken. The food is really consistent in taste and quality throughout the P F Chang's chain of Restaurants. I have no issues with the food quality and taste. The only area of opportunity is to get seated in a timely manner and the time it takes from ordering of the food to its delivery. During dinner hours there can be long waiting periods in the above categories. The pricing is economical and competitive with restaurants within its class.",

Why didn't the server taking my order know this?    Why didn't anyone page my room to let me know! So disappointed.

I eat at Chinese restaurants regularly in the Bay Area and I'm not a fan of non-authentic Chinese food but I thought we'd try ordering take-out and bringing it up to our room at PH. I do have to say their take-out counter is very convenient and is located next to the entrance.  We ordered the shaking beef which was too salty.  I'm a fan of salt but this dish had way too much.  The Dan Dan Noodles were ok. It was a little mushy and lacking flavor. I've had Dan Dan noodles at a lot of other places but this one tasted different. Cheesecake was good but tell them to put the raspberry sauce on the side, it tastes gross.  Overall, if you 're looking for some take-out, staying at PH, hungry for Chinese, and have enough points on your Total Rewards players card so you don't have to pay for your meal then order here and try different dishes.  P.F Chang's is just too overpriced and their food is just ok. Total price for shaking beef, Dan Dan noodles and cheesecake was $37. We could have eaten at Gordon Ramsey's BurGr again for the same price and had a good meal but were too lazy to sit down and eat at a restaurant in addition to BurGr being super busy. I suggest going to the Rio and eating at KJ Seafood and Dim Sum if you feel like Chinese. They have much better food!",

I was worried that a casino location might have a bit of a \"feed the masses in a hurry\" formula, but I was wrong.   There was a brief wait, so we took advantage of the busy, but friendly bar.   Once our dinner table was available, our server, Jeremy, was a skilled, friendly, professional guy who was a delight.

The meal consisted of: vegetarian lettuce wraps, fried green beans, pork dumplings, lemongrass salad, Kung Pao scallops, honey chicken, mongolian beef, pork lo mein, and brown and white rice.   Perhaps it was because of the size of the group, but everything (except the Mongolian beef) seemed really greasy.  Greasier than usual.  And the scallops were overly fried and greasy at the same time.  Still, I left with a full stomach and satisfied taste buds.  Their Moscow Mule was fabulous, though.

We arrived for lunch around 11:15 and checked in. They told us there would be a 10 minute wait. I went back to request a booth as another group of 4 came in. They were shown to a table right away. I asked for a booth and why we were told to wait but the other party was seated right away. The hostess did not respond then proceeded to show us to a table, not a booth and apologized for the confusion.  It was a least 10 minutes before a server came. She apologized and said they were short handed and our server had not shown up. This server who took our table in addition to the rest of her tables was the only good thing about our experience.  Food was ok. Service below average.",

The Mai Tai we had with our lunch was great... a tad on the strong side for lunch, but would rather have it a tad strong vs. weak. We ordered off of the gluten free section of the menu. I was surprised at the variety on the gluten free section of the menu. The food was very good. In fact we ate a bit more of the noodle dish than we needed to. They definitely don't skip on portion. We ate maybe half of the food and our waiter boxed everything up in front of us. The prices were actually much lower than I had expected. I would most definitely, and probably will, eat here again next time we are in Vegas.",

Their staff and extremely friendly. Timing of food was decent for a Sunday night. Ambiance is nice, dark setting nice tables and seats. Went with the dinner meal for two people which came out to about $49.00 total after tax. Dinner meal included 2 appetizers, 1 starter,  2 entrees and 1 dessert. We also got an appetizer on the house! Gotta love free food! My husband and I went with the egg drop soup, egg rolls, orange peel chicken and pepper steak. The crab wontons were delicious,  which were on the house. 2 thumbs up.",

First off, I asked them to go light on the pepper flakes on my Kung Pao, since I am a baby when it comes to heat. And of course, it was loaded with pepper flakes. However, it didn't really  matter in the long run because our waitress's breath smelled like a dumpster and she kept breathing on me. Pop a mint, honey! I totally lost my appetite because her ass mouth and avoided conversation with her like the plague. Also, she was slower than cold tar, it took forever to get each course.",

This is yet another time I faced horrible service. 1st off, waited for about an hour for the food to arrive and no one even cared to come and talk to us about it. Second, we ordered 3 drinks and given 4. We ordered 2 shrimp fried rice and 1 chicken. We did get 2 of the shrimp 1st and after waiting for another 20 mins, got the chicken one (for the person in our group who avoids shrimps), which had shrimp at the bottom. Ok mistakes might happen, but when we asked about this, the waiter simply waived it off saying \"I ordered whatever you guys asked for, the kitchen messed it up, and it wasn't my fault\". I wish I could get up and leave right away. I would have given a minus -1 star if that option was available. This was my second if not third (if I could remember correctly) with PF chang's.  Please either shut down the customer service or improve for God's sake.",

    "text": "I eat at the PF Chang's in The District at least once a month and am huge fan of the menu at this chain. The service is usually top notch, but my experience at this location was worth yelping about.   The hostess decided to look at me after I stood in front of her for two minutes. She told me the wait would be 45 minutes. Since I was meeting a long time friend for a concert I didn't mind.....   We waited, waited, and waited some more. We ended up waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes! The hostess was rude when we went up to check on it. She made us feel bad for asking. When we were finally taken to our seats we had to wait a while for our waiter. I'm getting used to all of this waiting by now even though I am starting to get hunger pains. No big deal.   We order and the waiter comes out with the sauce. Don't they usually do the sauce spiel every time? Maybe I'm just spoiled and use to the good service at the GV location. Regardless, he just poured the sauce and left. When we got our food the rice was the exact opposite of sticky rice. In fact, it was hard and resembled uncooked rice! Unbelievable. The good news was that the Dan Dan Noodles were out of this world! The distinct flavor of the cucumber cut the heat from the chile paste perfectly. The waiter did not ask if we wanted them cut. The Mongolian Beef was also a big hit. The meal would not be complete without their famous lettuce wraps which were delicious as usual.   Overall I was satisfied with the food and the presentation minus the uncooked rice. It's PF Changs, who doesn't enjoy the food? The staff, however was really rude and unprofessional and my guest and I were highly put off by this. Next time I am at this hotel I am going to the sandwich shop and sticking to my PF Changs in Green Valley.",

Ended up waiting for about 45 mins with a 10 min quoted time.  Our server was very good, but I noticed the people around us who had different servers ordered before us and got our food after us.  Their mai tai's sucked.  Drinks were not strong, or atleast descent for restaurant quality.  Food was ok.  Portions are a lot smaller then the other PF Changs.  One thing I did like about this restaurant is that they are not over priced for being on the strip, its the same pricing as other PF Changs.",

Its like when you hit a city you don't know after riding cross country next to sweaty pock faced woman in gray sweats that say (ARMY) on them and suffer under her wheezing, sighing, and sneezing, not to mention guffawing at a People magazine. You need a safe home to eat dinner, some safe, relatively hygenic food. So you hit the Irish pub and rinse old scabface out of your mind with a few pints of Guinness and a shepherd's pie.

We were excited to learn that there was a PF Chang's in the hotel we were staying!! I made reservations for Friday night (HIGHLY recommend reservations for the weekends)! The service was great as was their Pear Mojito, but the food was just okay. It didn't have the usual good flavor and only seemed to be luke warm. Also the garlic noodles were really on the rubbery side. I have to say we were pretty disappointed!",

The service here wasn't very good.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for our lettuce wraps, which seemed a little ridiculous.  Our dinners took another 20 minutes.  The food was good and hot when it finally arrived.  The layout of the restaurant wasn't so great and servers had to constantly push through crowds of customers since the kitchen was on the other side of the waiting area.",

You have old beer from the last drink you served dried out on the tap that gets dunked into the new beer, thus affecting the taste....that is uncalled for in a supposedly upscale place.

I ordered off the Gluten free menu and the food was fantastic.  Service was friendly. It's not expensive which in Vegas is a rare find and why I give it 4 stars (for value).",

The waitress was a little rude and seemed like she couldn't wait to get off work. I asked her about a the fried tofu to see if it was vegan and she just said no without any explanation or suggestions of any alternatives that are vegan. One of my friends wanted to know why it wasn't vegan so i asked and she replied with \"because of the sugar.\" i looked at her confused and asked what she meant because sugar comes from sugar cane, a plant. she responded with a very condescending attitude as if i were stupid and said that the sugar came from animal bone. (Later on I looked up on my phone what she was talking about and they actually do use ingredients that are derived from bone char... gross) By this point i got really frustrated and changed my order to the buddha's feast which was truly vegan. The wait for our food was ridiculously long and i am not exaggerating because i had been drinking. My friends can also confirm that it took forever to receive our food. We were actually in a hurry to meet up with a friend to get into a club. Once the food arrived it was alright but it was literally steamed vegetables with small slices of tofu mixed in. I got bored of this very easily also. I had to order two sides of rice because steamed vegetables would not be enough for a long night of drinking and dancing..  Try something else on the strip, you can get p f chang's anywhere! I didn't find it to be anything special.",

Dishes are approximately $9-$14 (according to my memory).  I always order the dan dan noodles.  This is by far the best dish they have!  The mushu pork is also pretty tasty and the servers even put the pancake and pork together for you!  Now that's service! something you NEVER get in an authentic Chinese restaurant!

This location had some of the FRIENDLIEST, most helpful servers ever. We had a party of 22 and received NO attitude from the staff. We had a private room upstairs and were given the choice of 5 set menus OR ordering individually. (most restaurants wouldn't give the choice...it would be the set menu 4 sho for a group that large) They obviously wanted to keep us boozed up cuz they were amazing at the drink service. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the drinks were only $5.50 a piece....and were poured heavy. Nice! The food was AMPLE, with about 10 different plates to choose from. Even though the food was served \"family style\" they provided every section of the big-ass table with their own plate of each dish. For about 10 dishes it was approx $29 per person....not including drinks, tax & gratuity of course. (It ended up being $47 a person) We even had control of the music level....which was turned all the way down due to the crappiness of the music. (Maroon 5, Jennifer Lopez, Matchbox 20...typical Star 98.7 shiz) This place is great for a big party...or if you crave mediocre chinese food at 12am. (they're open until 1am on wknds)  (fyi, it's located in the \"Planet Hollywood Hotel\"....formerly the \"Aladin Hotel\")",

We ordered the S&P Calamari and the Chicken Lettuce Wrap, Veggie Egg Rolls for appetizers and this I would recommend.   My niece ordered the Dbl Pan Fried Noodle and this one again was way too salty and the sauce is like the consistency of a maple syrup. My other niece ordered the honey chicken over rice and this one is okay to eat - rice is dry.  I would go back for appetizer but not for entree. I've had better Pan-Asian food especially here in San Francisco.",

I'm not a chain food restaurant fan, in fact, I'd rather go hungry then eat in 99% of the chains out there.  P F Chang's, on the other, serves consistently tasty food, as a reasonable price....especially compared to other Vegas fare. What I really like about PFC, is that they don't up-charge simply because they're in a hotel.  Most do.  A great example is Starbuck's....try ordering something in a hotel Buck's. Everything is almost $2 higher.  Not PFC.  My orange flavored beef was the same price as their franchise back in Denver.   We only had lunch here, but it was the cheapest, and most filling we had during our Vegas Vacation. Combine that with great service, decent view, my fav wine by the glass.....and you get 4 stars from me.   Rock on PFC !!",

I was especially pissed off by the bad service attitude of the waitress Stacy. First she messed up my order, and then tried to blame me for it. When the order was remade, it was awefully salty. After I got the bill, I told her that it was inedibly salty (I didn't eat 95% of the dish). I was just expressing my view and not looking to get it canceled on my bill or anything, but she just ignored me and picked up the dish and left. How about at least comforting the customer by saying \"sorry, next time we will make it better\". She just ignored me as if I am non-existent. Who the hell wants to eat at a restaurant where the waitress treats the customers like crap.  I have been to PF Chang's in different locations a good number of times and have always been satisfied with the food and service, except this time. I guess it's the waitress Stacy that ruined my experience at this PF Chang's at Planet Hollywood.",

But, after hours of: a) traffic, b) looking for parking, and c) walking aimlessly around City Center, we were all too exhausted to drive to Palazzo! We ended up stopping by PH to get a quick drink, when my friend saw that there was a PF Chang's. She called her friend and made reservations at PF Chang's instead. It was a good decision!  I love PF Chang's! No matter what you order, the quality of the food is excellent. What I also love is that they offer you brown rice instead of white rice.... I've never been disappointed. The 6 of us decided to order a variety of food - one poultry, one pork, one seafood, a salad and a noodle entree. YUM YUM for my tum tum! I was in heaven. My fav was the moo-shu and seafood entree.  I would have given five stars had the wait been less than 2 hours. Mind you, we went there on New Year's day and on a Friday...Regardless, we all had a wonderful time! The waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The wait for the food was not long at all.  Delicious food. Great service. Good times with friends. Definitely would come back!",

    "text": "It's Saturday night, 10:30pm, we just got out of a show and we're totally hungry and utterly dehydrated.  Both of these facts make perfect sense.  We're hungry since we haven't eaten in the last 12 hours.  We're extremely dehydrated because all we've ingested over the same 12 hours are cocktails, martinis, ketel one with diet rockstar, basically all kinds of chemicals that make you feel drunk and/or wired, but most certainly do not replenish the water content of your body at the cellular level.   Since we're staying at the Aladdin, we decide to eat at P.F. Chang's as it's convenient and always good.  The wait for a table is 45 minutes so we opt to eat at the bar instead.  The bartender, Peter, and his assistant both totally rock and do a stellar job with impeccable service.  We start with drinks as I get yet another martini and my wife gets a pear mojito.  Before I ingest a drop of alcohol, though, I ask for a glass of ice water.  I then proceed to drink 7 glasses of water within the next 10 minutes before even touching my martini.  Clearly my basic bodily function have decided that my brain is too fucked up to make the right choice and the cells in my body decide that they need to unite against this tyrant who keeps feeding them alcohol instead of pure and rejuvenating water.   Thankfully, I'm not that stupid that I would fight such a primal urge, so I drink glass after glass after glass of H2O.   Although I get a quizzical look from the assistant behind the bar, she's happy to oblige and brings me glass after glass as fast as I drink them.  We got the crab wontons and the Peking potstickers as appetizers.  I then had the Dan Dan Noodles and my wife had the crispy orange beef.   The best, said she, crispy orange beef she has ever had the pleasure to eat at P.F. Chang's.   Now we've been to Woodland Hills, San Diego, Thousand Oaks, Walnut Creek, and Emeryville locations, so we're not newbies.   Still, by far, she said this dish shined far above any other she has ever had.    I had the Dan Dan noodles, which were quite good and had a good spicy kick to 'em.   I gotta say though that after the 8 or 9 glasses of water that I drank and the crab wontons that I chomped on, I wasn't all that hungry at that point.  My eyes glazed over which typically means that I'll be snoring away within the next 15 minutes.   We took this as our cue to head back to the room for some well deserved sleep.",

Then came our entre, we ordered the shaking beef & pork lo mein for my husband and I to share.  My husband loved everything but I couldn't eat any of the meat because it was extremely salty, both the beef and the pork in the noodles were very salty so I just ate the noodles.  With that said I wouldn't take any one with high blood pressure to this place.  I don't have high blood pressure and I couldn't eat this meat.  If for some reason we decide to give this place a second chance I will have to order a vegetarian meal.",

We walked in on Valentine's Day, because our original restaurant plans didn't work out, and we were skeptical of getting a table seeing as what day it was. We ended up only waiting a couple of minutes, and we were able to get a table! It was towards the back not near anybody, in a booth, which was great! It was our first time ever stepping into one of these restaurants before, so we didn't know what to expect. It was shockingly quiet and elegant. We had a server, which I don't remember what his name was, but he was the best service we've ever received on our night out restaurant trips! He listened to our every need and he was constantly coming by at exactly the right times  to fill our drinks, get us a to go box, etc. The food we got was just amazing. We were skeptical because we don't really eat that type of food, but our meals definitely changed our minds. We ended our night here and it was a great ending. I definitely would go back here again, and this is our go to place every Valentine's Day.",

    "text": "This is more of a general review of the chain itself, having eaten at two separate P.F. Chang's chain restaurants.   I think the food is so average that the prices are bizarre. Actually, some of it is below average, because it is so darn salty. I was with four other people, and we all ate the beef and broccoli, and it was so salty that we had to complain even though we didn't want to. The waitress insisted that that's how they normally make it and that we would have to inform them next time if we want it less salty. So, the waitress gave a newly cooked and less salty plate of beef and broccoli. You could barely taste the flavoring of all the dishes. I have had the kung pao shrimp twice, and it lacked any kind of spiciness. Not even a hint. The kung pao shrimp was also salty, as well as the sweet and sour soup. We did the dinner for two and for the amount of meat they give, the amount of rice is lacking.   I guess the pricey has to do with the high end appearance and up keep of the restaurant itself. It is nice and the servers are nice, but I definitely would not go there again. It's overrated and expensive.",

    "text": "I've invented an invisibility formula. Sort of.   From now on whenever I don't want to be seen or talked to I'm going to go to the P. F. Chang's at Planet Hollywood in Vegas. My wife and I were shown to a table fairly quickly, which was good. But I was convinced that we were going to witness the second coming of Christ before a server approached our table. This was bad. We had just been book shopping before coming in here and I was thinking that maybe I had time to read my new book before we were waited on. I could have written one.  A waiter, suddenly remembering that he had a job, finally came to our table and thanked us for our patience. There was no apology offered for our wait. Just an 'Atta boy' for hanging in there. He asked if he could start us off with some drinks but since we already had an eon to stare at the menu we were able to give our full order right away. I ordered the Chang's Spicy Chicken because there's nothing like sweet & spicy chili sauce when you're feeling ill-tempered. I didn't even bother to take a picture of my food to go along with this review. So if you've never seen what spicy chicken looks like - or a bottle of Budweiser, than I'm sorry to disappoint. But whenever I can't give you a picture - I WILL give you a thousand words.  Everything started to proceed somewhat swimmingly from here -  and 'swimmingly' isn't a word I use very often so that's a testament to how much better things really were going. We got our food pretty quickly and it was good. The waiter even came by asking if he could get me another beer. He was probably trying to get me drunk in hopes that it would increase his chances of getting a decent tip (didn't happen).  Then the invisibility formula kicked in again and we could no longer be seen or heard for another extended period of time. My wife asked if I wanted to get dessert but I was worried that might take another eight hours. I just wanted to pay the bill (or the 'check' as Americans so charmingly call it) and get out. We were finally able to get the waiter's attention and hand him our credit card. He disappeared without a trace for about ten minutes or so. I was starting to think that they truly didn't want us to leave. This must be how Henley and Frey felt when they wrote \"Hotel California.\" And Don Felder too. A staff member eventually approached us and said that their credit card machine was down and that they were waiting for it to come back online. Later on it did. And we left - never to return.  \"Hotel California\" has always been a work of mystery with no one truly knowing what the lyrics are really about. I do. Me, P. F. Chang, and I suspect - H. G. Wells. Along with Henley and Frey, of course. And Don Felder too.",

Always makes me much better.... Very delicious  Pepper steak, marinated flank steak tossed with yellow onion, red & green peppers in a garlic and black pepper sauce: hubby's favorite  Hunan-style hot fish, Crispy slices of tilapia in a tangy, spicy sauce with stir- fried vegetables: Spicy spicy spicy, only way for bad hangover!

We were seated quickly and our server was over shortly after.  Drinks came out fast.  Our server was very helpful with our order. After taking our order, he mentioned that going with the \"for 2\" option would be cheaper.  We ended up going that route.   Another server brought out or app...and another one \"on the house\"...sweet! The apps were good, lettuce wraps and the beans. Our meals came out and we're excellent as well.  Since we had a lot of food, our server helped us pack things up and used small containers so we could stash them in the small hotel fridge.    A great experience here!",

The salad was lacking flavor with a huge amount of lettuce. I thought it was just ok. I prefer the ahi tuna salad at the Yard House. I wish I had ordered the spicy shrimp appetizer instead it's one of my favorites instead I was trying to be healthy and the meal was a bit boring.",

It was 5:30 so it hadn't started to get crowded yet.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. It was happy hour so we got a few drinks and the tuna rolls. All was great. We ordered the changs for two special and both got egg drop soup which is fabulous. We then got the chicken lettuce wraps, they never disappoint. For our dinners we shared the changs spicy chicken and kung pao scallops. Both were prepared perfectly. The amount of scallops you get is amazing and they are cooked perfect. For dessert we got the banana wontons, he said they were great, I didn't have any due to my cinnamon allergy. What a great experience, we will continue to come back.",

He charged us separately for the child's juice even tho the kids menu mentioned that each meal comes with a drink, and he was the one to suggest the pineapple juice... ( -.5*) Food: really good! Cooked as expected and we had leftovers too, so big portions. We ordered from the \"for two\" menu, the wonton soup and egg drop. The egg drop soup needed more salt. The crab wontons. Good! No complains. The moo goo gai pan with brown rice. It was so big i ate only half. Really tasty tho! And the husband got the Mongolian beef with brown rice, and according to him it was just perfect. And for desert we had the chocolate raspberry wontons. Eh... I've had better.  Our 14mo old had the kids lo mein and she ate the whole thing!!  I wish i could give a 4 1/2 stars.",

I am willing to give it another shot and I will update this review accordingly. The service was incredibly slow, my water was never refilled. The food once it arrived was not hot. The 'Cafe latte\" was in fact coffee with milk, that is cafe ole, for those of you keeping score. The soy sauce would not come out of the unclean and clogged container. As I said I will go again, and update my review, but they have some work to do. If I could I would give it 2 1/2 stars but I can't so sadly I must round down.

Just love all the glass and bright colors while still being darker and sultry like you want at a bar. The bartenders were just awesome and fun to talk to. They made me a coconut mojito and it rocked my world! I enjoy mojitos and I enjoy coconut, but their homemade colada mix (that they let me try) curled my toes and made me smile. Definitely having this again! For apps, I had the Avocado Lobster roll and hubs had Dynamite Shrimp and Dumplings. I enjoyed my roll. Nice portion size and beautifully prepared, but flavor combo didn't knock my socks off. Hubs shrimp was just ok. Good, but nothing special. His dumplings, though, were incredibly good. I'd definitely go back for that mojito, dumplings, and excellent company at the bar!",

The sake here has no after taste as most of the others that I have tried. Paired with there fantastic egg rolls makes for a great selection.  After our gathering upon friends and catching up who wants to cook so decided that take out from here would be great and my twins need to eat too. So took home the beef fried rice and veggie fried rice. On the veggie rice they even substituted extra broccoli for bean sprouts. The food was excellent and they even include in the take home food plates and fortune cookies.

When I spoke to Chris, the  manager about this.. he was nonchalant and apathetic while no efforts were put forth to rectify the matter; he didn't even apologize and never once checked on us. So, I requested for a coffee mug to keep my 88 year old mom's sanity. The manager would rather stop by @ the bar and check the games instead of doing table touches. The service was so poor that we didn't finish our meal and left. To add insult to injury, when we were leaving, the elevator didn't work which means having my elderly mom to take the stairs!!",

It was nice through out the whole time that we were here and made me actually want to go back to one of the PF's in my city.

It seems this particular location has more good ones than bad.  We have several ones we regularly ask for who are absolutely the bomb.  We've been to this particular joint about 15 times and the food has always been good.  Not great, but good enough.  Sitting on the patio is really what makes this place a blast on a weekend.  The people watching while having a few drinks is fun.  You have the beautiful (at least on the outside) Citycenter towering over PH.  The sidewalk going by the patio is ground zero for a lot of crazy activity, and you're pretty much guaranteed to see something interesting during dinner on a Saturday night.  The waits are usually pretty bad during the evenings, a phone-ahead reservation really helps.",

    "text": "i hadn't been to a P F Chang's before but have seen them all over Seattle and was excited when the bf suggested we try it. We went at 8pm on a Wednesday and was told that there was a 45 minute wait and so we happily took our buzzer and went and sat in the Planet Hollywood's Extra bar. Their drinks were fabulous and 30 minutes later, the buzzer was going off. We were seated on the top floor in the back and so it was nice and quiet, despite the 2 long tables of people in front of our booth.  They have a 2-For-$40 deal that provides you with your choice of soup, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 mini desserts. Waaaayyyy too much food for 2 people but it allowed us to try all kinds of dishes.   I started with a wine flight, that gives you 3 - 2.5 oz glasses of wine for $10. $10!!! Definitely took advantage of that as they have an extensive wine list. The bf had a beer as they were $3 and cheaper than anything you can buy on the strip. Bonus!  For our soup course, we both had the Sweet and Sour and it was full of chicken, mushrooms, tofu, and egg ribbons. It was kinda spicy but a nice way to start the meal. Portions are huge and so I felt bad about only eating half but otherwise wouldn't have been able to get past the appetizer flight.  For the appetizer, we had the Chicken Wraps. I had heard nothing but about how good these wraps are since we found the restaurant the night before. They lived up to their reputation though as everything from the lettuce to the little sauce that was customized for us, was wonderful. Again, the dish wasn't finished as you would have to stuff the lettuce leaves to capacity to get through all of the filling they provide you with.  For entrees, we had the Mongolian Beef and Cantonese Shrimp. The beef was accompanied by long pieces of green onion and wasn't too gingery. The meat was nicely seared so the marinade formed a crunchy outside. Delish! The shrimp were in a light garlic sauce and the snow peas were perfectly cooked. We had brown rice on the side and there was definitely enough food for 4 people. Yikes but yummmm!  For dessert, our fabulous waiter brought out a litle sample tray and explained each shot-glass sized dessert to us. We chose the Strawberry Cheesecake and S'more and while I was too full to try them, they were gone in about 30 seconds. The perfect end to a meal!  If you get this deal, either expect to have multiple leftovers or make sure you have a large party to help share the feast!",

    "text": "Ok - when my friends suggested we order some PF Changs after recovering from weekend shananigance in our hotel my reaction was \"really?? ewww\". I was forced to go to a work thing at PF Chang's in another state and the food was awful - so now you understand my reaction.   Either way needless to say we ordered some \"chinese food\". We ordered: - Lemon Grass Prawns with Garlic Noodles: this was YUMMY and the prawns were huge.  - Chicken Noodle Soup: this was fantastic - Chicken Chopped Salad + Sesame Vinaigrette: this was a good salad but I think b.c. it was delivery it was not as good as it would have been in the restaurant. - Crab Wontons: eh - nothing special and not very flavorful - Chicken Lettuce Wraps: good reviews of this staple item - Dynamite Shrimp: Good - Almond & Cashew Chicken: Yummy - Egg Drop Soup: Good as well  While all items were satisfying and between the four of us (yes all of that for only 4 people) we had crazy left overs.   The best part about this PF Chang's is probably their customer service. They forgot the sesame dressing for the salad and we were able to convince them to deliver it to the room. To make up for this inconvenience the manager included a piece of their cheesecake and some kind of chocolate amazingness (was it a brownie? chocolate cake? a large chocolate candy situation? No idea). Aside from them being nice enough to bring us the dressing the desserts were out of this world. I'm going to say this and I'm hoping there won't be any backlash from cheesecake connoisseurs BUT this was one of the best, if not THE best cheesecakes I've ever had.",

Located conveniently on the strip, this PF Chang's is easy to find and easy to go to.  So beware the crowds and the potential long wait if you go during peak eating hours.  The staff is usually friendly, as the people who may eventually annoy are  customers as well.  If I can offer you one word of great advice for this location (not sure if they do it in another locations), order from the lunch plates...and go before 4pm.  The lunch plates offer you individual servings of varying dishes and come included with rice and either egg drop or sweet and sour soup.  You can easily have an entree, 2 drinks (non-alcoholic), and 2 of these lunch plates for $40 total.  Not bad considering the potential bill when dining family style and after 4pm.",

    "text": "on 2/25 we hosted a 21st bday weekend for 16....the restaurant chosen for the bday dinner was P.F.Changs @ Planet Hollywood Hotel.  Everything was pre-arranged with Darnella, the manager. Private room was already booked so we were to be seated in main dining area. The table they set up was upstairs facing the \"strip\"; absolutely beautiful view. Our waiter, David, was fantastic; so attentive....  The food was good; as I expected.  I truly felt that our service was as if we were in a 5 star restaurant.  So impressed.  they brought out a huge; bday dessert (delicious choc cake) at the end of our meal to celebrate the special bday. I reluctantly chose P..F. Changs after the other asian fusion restaurant I selected had some issues.  I didn't want a \"chain\" restaurant, but I was running out of time to book. I would highly recommend anyone planning a large dinner party in Vegas; not overlook  this P.F. Chang's for the reasons I almost had.  I pre-ordered the food; which was a better value.",

We ordered Lettuce Wraps and the spareribs (WITH SAUCE) and Crab Rangoon.  All of it was quality food.  I also ordered an asian pear martini.  I was spectacular!  Ahhh...the joys of adult beverages.    On my second trip of the day, we were seated upstairs in the back.  Its a very intimate location.  I happen to like upstairs because it's not as noisy as the main dining area.  We ordered Wonton Soup, which comes in a bowl, big enough for 4, and Combination Fried rice.  That fried rice was the best I've ever had in all my years.  Damn, it was good!    I love P.F. Changs...with a passion.",

    "text": "GREAT WALL OF SALT  We came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe.   We decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird.   Our waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.  I started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.  We then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.  For dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy.   Everything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.  I would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these.   To recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me.",

    "text": "I've eaten at this PF Changs 2 other times.  Reviews not written back then because they were all pre-Yelp.  One thing consistent with both experiences was the long wait.  And because Pei Wei (aka their baby cousin) taste pretty much the same, I never made my way back here.   Well, my most recent visit was for a friend's wedding celebration.  Congratulations Jenny on wedding number #3.  I know we joke about it.  3 times a charm!!  Couple of things to point out first; 1.  We had the whole upper level to ourselves 2.  The food was served buffet style 3.  Great view of the strip from our dining area  I actually liked the fact that we had the whole upstairs to ourselves.  This meant we can all enjoy the celebration without worrying about other patrons.  I knew I was eating cake later and having a couple of drinks, so I didn't take full advantage of the buffet.  I kept it to one plate.  I had their chicken lettuce wraps and their beef with broccoli.  There was a bunch of other usual's at the buffet (i.e. noodles, meins, rice, and wontons).    The food here is always consistent. I'm still a fan of the food, just not a huge fan because the wait here always seems to take a long time.  I also spent some time at the bar catching up with friends. I had a few drinks.  The bartenders and waitresses were all efficient, at least with me.  One of my friends felt slided a little since her drinks always took forever or forgotten while mine were always right on.  All this did was just remind me about the service or lack of at the location.  But in the end, I'm not complaining because we were celebrating one of my closest friend's wedding, the food was free, and the drinks kept me happy.    PS:  Some of the other guests thought that the service was worth 2 stars and would have written a review if they Yelped.  While some thought it was a solid 4 stars.  I guess it comes down to the individual who's reviewing this place.  For me, I think 3 stars is just about right.

We also got a complementary Kung Pao Chicken so that sure made up for it! The Kaleidoscope Roll was very disappointing, it was very plain :( The arrangement of the roll was not very pretty either which was a big disappointment but it didn't taste BAD.

The thing with finding a favorite bartender is that they never make you feel like you are bothering them. She always has service with a smile!!  That's a great employee!! I always recommend to my my friends and family that live in Vegas or go to Vegas to swing by and see her. I definitely would not come back in to this PF Changs if she wasn't around! Thanks Robin!!",

I ordered a Moscow Mule, which didn't come in the traditional copper mug, but the fresh taste of the drink made up for the presentation flaw.  The appetizer that deserves honorable mention was the pork steamed dumplings and the chicken Satay.  Amazing!  The Singapore street noodles and chicken lo mien was also very good and the lo mien was the clear winner.  The fact that this is a chain restaurant, really surprised me.

So it's disappointing when the location literally across the street from my house (Green Valley) fails SO miserably I have to drive across town to eat at one. THIS location does not disappoint.   Valet parking at Miracle Mile & a quick walk through the mall makes for easy access. Located inside Planet Hollywood it's a bit hidden inside the casino if you're not entering on foot from The Strip. Running the perimeter of the casino, it's located next to the PH Rewards desk.   Huge bar & seating area. Looks like there's an upstairs section as well. Our server was attentive & very nice. Our iced teas stayed filled without being asked. Absolutely no complaints. Our lunch, shrimp potstickers & combo fried rice, was plenty for two. It was an enjoyable weekday lunch.   If only I could remember our servers name!!  We inadvertently left our credit card behind and he chased us through the casino to return it to us. Now that's service & honesty. My friend in town for business could have been left in a huge pinch had our server not done this. Our appreciation couldn't be expressed enough...and he refused any additional tip for doing this. While I can't remember his name, I remember his face and will definitely ask to be seated in his section the next time I'm in and see him working. Truth be told, this act alone warrants the 5-stars and my repeat business.",

    "text": "I love PF Changs. I'd love it even if it hadn't been referred to in a jokingly mocking type of way in the second installment of The Hangover (when Gallifanakkis's character asks if the Buddist Temple is a PF Changs), but a bit of verbal product placement never hurt anyone.   I was in Vegas for a friends wedding and was the first of our crew to arrive, so I went walking. I didn't want to ruin the strip for myself quite yet, so I wandered down off the beaten path and found this PF Changs.   I was seated immediately by a friendly and talkative blonde waitress. When I told her I had just arrived in town from Toronto she informed me that she'd never been to Toronto or Canada for that matter and was a Las Vegas local. I thought the experience just have been unique for both sides of the street as she'd never been to Toronto and I had never been to Vegas. As I was there, I considered myself up 1-0.    I ordered beef and steamed veggies, and a side of their egg rolls. If you've never tried them, they're really good. Especially given how this is a corporate venture and not a mom and pop restaurant, I wouldn't have expected much but they're very surprising. Along with three very fairly priced Bud Lights (it is Sin City after all!), my bill came up to be a very reasonable $24!  Worth the trip. Just tell them Zack sent you",

Main dish: sweet and sour chicken.  But it was good in technique, if not really original in flavors. Chicken was properly breaded and fried. I hate getting Chinese food takeout and the breading is falling off....not appealing.   A pretty extensive menu, but with so much to eat in Vegas this simply would not be my first choice.",

You would think for being one of there busiest locations the customer service would be on the slow side with the amount of traffic they are passing through. But I did not feel that at all. In fact it was better than it had ever been. Not to mention our waitress Rebecca was incredible and super friendly but not over baring. But most important the food was great.",

We sat down with a large group and no sooner as I put my purse on the back of my chair, a server or busser ran into our table with a tray loaded full of glasses and literally hit me with full glasses of ice water in the chest, shoulder, lap, tops of my feet. Broken glass was everywhere including my lap. So, deducted two stars for that. I was apologized to profusely by the man that did it and although I did not ask for a manager, he went to get one. The manager did not really introduce himself other than calling himself the manager and asked if I was injured. I was freezing, embarrassed and in shock. I was offered napkins and towels and then off he went. Never came back to see if I was okay, if the service had improved (I mean, you can kinda only go up from there), no offer to discount a meal, or comp even my hot tea that I needed to stay warm since I was now sitting in ice water soaked clothing in the middle of December. There went the other two stars. So, I'm left with a story, a couple of bruises from flying water glasses and a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to the service here.",

Food is delicious, service is always great and amazing atmosphere and views of the strip. Our faves are vegetable spring rolls for an appetizer, pepper steak, or lo mein, and order a fried rice (extra charge) but worth it because it's so good! Please make sure if your party is 8 or more you'll cut your wait time by calling in and making reservations a day ahead or at least a couple hours before arrival time. Wish I had pictures but my phone died and we ate as soon as food was placed on the table.   Update: Once again we enjoyed dinner at our traditional Sunday dinner at PF Chang's!",

We ordered Thai harvest curry with chicken, little did I know my wife does not like coconut in Thai curry.   So it was fried rice which saved us .lol.. but Thai curry was good.

He was friendly, accommodating, and very thoughtful. Throughout the entire meal he was very attentive of what we needed when we needed it.  I ordered the calamari which was surprisingly good! It had a good crunchy breading and the squid was cooked well and size was perfect. I also enjoyed that it sat on a bed of rice crisps. I also ordered the lettuce wraps which filled 2 people easily. The sauce that came with it was a bit underwhelming though. Finally, the general tso's chicken was delicious and plentiful. We couldn't finish it so we had leftovers and it was just as good the next day.  This was obviously on the strip so parking was nonexistent. Everyone is already on foot here anyways. They had window seating so it was great to people watch.",

She was very welcoming, attentive and helpful.    We ordered two cups of egg drop soup, Mongolian beef and Garlic Noodles.  It was the perfect amount to be shared by two.  Everything was delicious and with a little Sriracha sauce on the side, it was perfect!  I do miss the hot sauce, mustard and vinegar that they use to put on the table prior to getting the food.  But the fact that they will bring it to you, it helps.",

As you know having a wedding can be stressful, especially as a destination wedding, we had about 70guests.  I figured that our dinner at PFChangs restaurant would go ok but I was completely and utterly blown away.  Im very particular and have pretty high expectations  to a fault and let me tell you, the staff completely BLEW AWAY my needs expectations....My bride and I were very VERY happy about the food and best of all the quality of service.  My wife and I came in about 45 mins after our guest arrived due to wedding photo delay.  In our absence the woman helping us totally took charge. When we arrival she really made us feel taken care of.  The food was promptly served upon our arrival.  Sensing that I was a bit stressed about having 70 plus family and friends as guests she got me my favorite mixed drink and her and the other staff members just gave us the best service that I think Ive had at a restaurant in a LONG TIME.  I used to be a server, these guys were hitting every point, every ball out of the park.  When it came time for us to have cake, another guy (Sean?) made sure that all the food was boxed up by the other staff members and made room for the cake.  We cut our first bite, then the cake was cut and served by the team and everyone there was just more than happy with the quality of food, the quality of service and the overall experience.  The servers really made the night VERY memorable.  Not once did I feel rushed or not taken care of.  I was in awe at their efficiency from the time we arrived, serving all the guests appetizers and a multi course meal,  busing all the tables, allowing us to have our speeches and take our time, cutting the cake and sending us off with leftovers.  We will definitely be back!  Unfortunately Ive totally forgotten the names of the people who helped us out but Im sure you have record of it.  Lady helping us out AMAZING, Sean very kind, very attentive, ran across the casino because I left my receipt AMAZING, taller guy, very attentive, very personable AMAZING, Bartender AMAZING.  I really really want you to know the value in the staff you employed that night, they just completely exceeded my already high expectations.  Just...Wow...",

There are a gazillion places to eat in LV and I suppose we could have put a bit more effort into planning ahead. This was textbook PF Chang's, our appetizers were out fast Pork Dumplings and Bbq spare ribs as expected tasted just as we remembered. Trailing behind the app's was my dragon roll.  What I haven't mentioned yet and more difficult to describe was our server Phillip. Certainly better suited as a server at Friday's, he was good but over the top and after hearing his \"shtick\" a few times exhausting. Our plates cleared and entrees arrived and were delivered with precision. P had the lettuce wraps and I enjoyed the long noodles with prawns. But we were full, and enjoying the rest of the meal was well not happening. I ate the prawns and left the noodles plus I had a couple of wraps.  The food was perfect PF Chang's, executed to corporate perfection. It's safe even if Phillip is your server, we left him a 30% tip so can request his section on your visit.  Food guy-Martin",

It was the first time any of the five people in our party had been to Chang's, and we weren't sure because it is a chain restaurant.  Everything we had from appetizers to dessert was great, but the best part was our server Jose.  To say he should be mentoring every server in Vegas, would be an understatement. Although he was quite busy, he made us feel like we were his only table.  We liked the food and service at Chang's so much, that we made a second trip before leaving town. For a really good, moderately priced dinner in Vegas, check out Chang's at Planet Hollywood.",

With a hangover from Friday night partying, no breakfast, hundreds of people queuing up for hotel buffets, PF Chang's was a True savior. This was my second visit to this place at Planet Hollywood. While the first one was a dinner date with my husband, this one was a lunch with friends. Both experiences were equally great. With soups, starters, entrees, and desserts for 7 people (we had to get doggy packs too), the bill was under 100$!!!! Dishes to die for: Hot n sour soup Chicken lettuce wrap Dan dan noodles Dali chicken (for the spicy food lovers) Chocolate cake with raspberry syrup (I am not a chocolate fan but this was yum!!) Great service, good food, friendly staff, value for money, and above all NO WAITING on a weekend :). Highly recommended",

We have had this dish prepared at noodle houses and authentic Asian restaurants. Let me tell you, what P.F. Chang's is peddling is NOT chow fun. This stuff is nothing more than egg noodles, a few strips of meat and the slightest amount of flavoring; nothing like dish I am used to with delicious gravy, fresh vegetables and plenty of meat. To say the least, I was disappointed. My fiance loved her VIP Duck though. Also, the lettuce wraps, which we did not get this time, are always great. The duck and the wraps are the only reason I gave them 2 stars. If it were left to the chow fun they would have gotten -2 stars.",

This was the very first PF Chang's I ever went to, so it holds a dear place in my heart.. this was also the time I discovered the amazing food they serve. I didn't even know the name of the restaurant, I just knew what I ate there and what it tasted like. A few years later (maybe one or two) My friend told me he wanted me to try one of his favorite dishes and (hold and behold) it was the same exact thing I ate in Vegas! I believe it was Cantonese Chicken.  So tender, so tasty, so.. so.. ! Well, you get the point.  I remember the experience this way: It was May or June 2007. We were walking down the strip looking for something to eat. My companion had already been to PF Chang's and told me he really liked the chicken there. The  wait was about 45 minutes (I remember this because I said: I can't wait that long, I'm hungry!). We got a buzzer and walked to the bar at Planet Hollywood. I remember the big strobe light there... I took like 15 pictures of it.  We sat for a bit and before we knew it the buzzer went off. We were taken to the second floor, and what was so great is that we could bring our drinks from the bar with us! We ordered and got our food pretty quickly (I remember this because I believe I was counting the seconds!). I wouldn't say it was an extraordinary experience, but I would say that it was the start of a beautiful, long lasting, loyal and most importantly strong relationship between myself and this fabulous chain! I don't care if people say they are overrated, I love their food, their look, their service, hell.. I love that I can make reservations on-line!! We are in this Together Changy!! =0}",

Really nice ambiance and atmosphere the lighting was perfect really set the mood to eat even though we had been eating all day since we were on vacation! I didn't know what to expect seeing as it was in the front of planet Hollywood but we didn't make reservations and we didn't have to wait to be seated. When we were seated they gave us a nice booth in the corner that was really private. Super good service we were attended to the whole time didn't have to ask for anything! We had the dinner for two which included a list of things to choose from I had gereral pao's chicken she had the Mongolian beef. We had hot and sour soup to start out with which was great since I've never tasted two hot and sour soups the same and it  really varies on a scale of bad to great. They also brought out some chile  sauce, vineger, and some Asian sauce( can't remember what it was  called) which really heightened the taste of the soup and the lettece wraps we had as an appetizer. For desert we skipped the small shot glass deserts and went with the biggest piece of chocolate cake I have ever seen let alone eaten (yum) ! Really great food good service and just an overall nice fining experience! Have gone back there again but this time in Seattle still really good!",

    "text": "Being from Vancouver where there's a lot of great Asian cuisine, my friend and I didn't see the need to dine at a place which serves Asian food. But after eating Caucasian food non stop since we landed, we decided to give this place a try. We were also intrigued by the line up outside the restaurant; and since we've never eaten here we thought we'd try this place.   My first impression of the place was 'wow'. A huge and quite a classy place so I was impressed right off the bat. Right outside, people can be spectators and watch the busy kitchen as they scoop, portion, scale, deep fry, pan fry and prepare the food. I'm always fascinated by this because this looks really cool to me. Anyway, my friend and I waited around half an hour for our food, which I wasn't very happy about. Thank goodness I had something to watch for half an hour while they make my food.   We ordered the Crab Wontons, Singapore Street Noodles, and the Shanghai Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. The wontons were nice and crispy, I LOVED the filling. The shrimp dish was pretty decent. I found the vegetables quite soft, which was surprising because Asian restaurants usually serve vegetables quite crisp. Well in Vancouver anyway. The noodle dish had a nice ,strong curry flavor. The shrimp was cooked well but the chicken was kinda tough and sinewy.  Overall it was ok. I think the fact that I'm immersed in a wide variety of Asian cuisine here at home makes me more critical of Asian cuisine elsewhere. My friend best described it as \"white man's version of Asian food\". Which is actually very True.   Good value for the price; I'm quite annoyed that I completely missed the dessert menu. I really wanted to try the Banana Spring Rolls, the Tres Leche Lemon Dream, the Apple Pie and the Carrot Cake. But really, I shouldn't be eating dessert while in Vegas. Just bad for my gut.   There's also a gluten free menu for you guys and gals who can't have gluten.  Would I come back? Maybe. It wouldn't be the first place I would think of visiting but I would consider it. It gets a 3.5/5 from me, but I think I'll kick it down to 3/5 stars. It could be a lot better.",

We went in and were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait.... we were going to leave, but the host told us he'd sit us on the patio immediately.  Awesome!    From the patio, you have a great view of the strip.  My only complaint was the awkward view of the back of the horse statue.....weird :-)  The wonton soup was delicious!  Big enough for two to share.  If you like tea, try the dragon tea.  I tasted some of my boyfriend's and it was amazing.  And it comes out in this cute little cast iron pot!  Entrees are large, I'd say order soup, one entree and share!",

I will admit some fault, I asked if the lemon chicken could be prepare not spicy, the waitress said \"Yes\" however when my meal came, it was spicy. I commented about it to the waitress and her comment was \"no it's not\" and did not even offer to get me an alternative dish. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service.   I have been to PF Chang's before and while the food was good, I don't think it's better than most chinese food.",

Now I say that because we have PF Chang's at home, and there are a zillion other places that are new to try.  We had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  We waited outside in the casino area.  In the casino area, there is a window right into the kitchen.  Everyone thought it was unusually for not ONE Asian person to be working in the kitchen.  Our pager went off, but when we got inside, they told us there were two people with the same name and they didn't know which one was the right person, and we would have to wait longer. After another 7-10 minutes, we were called again.  We were sat, and ordered food very quickly.  Everyone's food was correct, and we all enjoyed our dinner.   There are plenty of other spots around Vegas that serve the same type of food, at less cost, and less wait.  If you are one of the people that loves to eat on the strip, then go for it, because a PF Chang's is the same throughout the country.",

Singapore Noodles, Dan Dan noodles, orange beef, honey chicken or shimp weren't bad and what I usually ordered.  I appreciate the brown or white rice option. Also their ice teas are surprisingly pretty good- like their blackberry jasmine green.  Now they have lunch specials- You have a few entree choices and you get hot& sour or egg drop soup.  Lunch specials are not badly priced and glad it was introduced after PF Changs stopped giving a discount to people who work in Miracle Mile/PH. Boo- they make so much money...really they can't? I normally am not a stickler about a discount but all other smaller chains and non chains offered a discount in PH but the largest chain can't to employees? Went from 25% to 20% to 15% to none in a matter of like a year.   They effed up my order a few times and it sucks having to run back and waste my lunch break. I had to get in the habit of checking everything before leaving as once it wasn't even my order, another time I only had half of what I ordered for me and the girls at work, and another I ordered sides of veggies and it wasnt in there.   For that, I can't really give them much due to their mistakes. It always ruined my lunch break since I end up having to get my food, take a few bites and I'm SOL and have to clock back in and eat lunch for dinner. That's fucked up that it happened 4 times before I got smart to look. And yes, they made a mistake twice after that and I got charged twice one day.   2.5 stars for their mistakes and being discount stingy. 3.5 for the food as it usually was pretty big portions and tasty enough.",

    "text": "My flight back to DC was at midnight two Sundays ago.  I still had my room at Planet Hollywood and it was dinner time and I was starving.  I was going to be eating by myself, something that I usually don't enjoy doing so I tried to be good and quell my hunger with a fabulously healthy and nutritious Strawberry Whirl (with Immunity boost.. god I don't want to get this flu!) which I got inside the millennium mall next door.  I was restless and alone and needed some fresh air so I took a walk outside in the cold air with my cold drink around the corner to see what was going on at Krave.  Krave is gone.  It closed in October of last year and will be opening downtown in a few months or so the nice valet for the tony looking Italian restaurant that abuts the former Krave location informed me.  I headed back around the corner into the bright lights of the strip.  My Jamba Juice cup was empty.  My hunger was coming back full force.  I felt light headed and in need of comfort.    I headed into PF Chang's and got a seat at the bar and ordered a Sapporo and some Sesame chicken and struck up a conversation with my neighbors at the bar who were drinking saki and having a good time.  The vibe was great here.  Tony, my server, gave me excellent quick  friendly up beat service.  After I was warmed up a bit with my food and friendly surroundings two beefy cowboys from Houston took the seats on the other side of me at the bar.  They ended up drinking saki too and we had a great time talking and I didn't feel like I was eating or drinking alone any more.   My other neighbors left, and needless to say my cowboy neighbors corrupted me into ordering saki as well and I dragged my meal out for a few hours just drinking and talking with them.  They seemed to appreciate my company as much as I did theirs, but when 10PM rolled around I had to pull myself away and get my luggage from my room (just steps away upstairs at PH) and jump in a cab to the airport.  I did get their numbers though.  Thanks, PF Changs for delivering consistent good food and friendly service.  Wether it's Bentonville AK, Tyson's Corner VA, or even the strip in Las Vegas, NV.  You guys deliver and provide a nice atmosphere conducive to a relaxed good time.  FYI.. The Large Saki I ordered was only $6.50 and packed a punch and I don't even think it was happy hour at the time since it was well after 8PM.. what a value!",

    "text": "This rating got 3 stars because our server, Sarah, was very good! I got the lobster avocado roll, a new item, along with some other dishes and my boyfriend got the beef and broccoli. All were very good except for the lobster sushi roll. I give that a ZERO on flavor and originality. I think there was mustard on the roll... wtf?!? That is an ingredient that doesn't need to go anywhere near a sushi roll - ever. EVER. Also, Sarah told us that they've started taking the soy sauce off the tables and do it on request only... good to know! They also didn't do the pre-sauce mixture table side anymore. I don't know if it was that location specifically (because of heavy traffic flow) or what. The prices didn't reflect being on the strip which I was thankful for, but all in all - decent experience thanks to Sarah :)... otherwise I would not have been impressed. A good server appreciates another good server :)",

    "text": "I used to be a huge fan of PF Chang's, but after my most recent visit to the Planet Hollywood location my views have drastically changed. As most people probably skip or skim very lengthy reviews, I'll try my best not to be too long winded.   In short: Skip this place unless you like RAW CHICKEN and poor service!   The full story: A group of us we to lunch here while on a Vegas trip for my friend's 29th birthday. The meal started off ok until a friend noticed that her chicken was completely raw on the inside. Not just a little pink, but RAW! it was basically seared chicken covered and concealed in sauce. UNACCEPTABLE.   To top if off, the manager was hardly accommodating. She did take a small percentage off of my friend's check, but in the end she was still charged for the inedible plate of raw chicken that she was served.   As we tried to move on from the upset, our server seemed to completely give up on pleasing us in any way. He dropped silverware on multiple members of our party, brought out a dirty dessert spoon for my friends birthday dessert, and then tried to cover it up by saying he had mixed a sauce with it. I'm sorry ... what?? You mixed sauce with a spoon, then brought it out for my friend to eat her birthday dessert with? Then please explain why there is dried brown food stuck to the spoon that you supposedly just mixed raspberry sauce with. We weren't buying it at all.   We left PF Chang's completely dissatisfied and praying that my friend would make it through the trip without getting sick from having eaten raw chicken. I'd give it NO stars if it were possible.  No thanks to the staff at PF Chang's and despite our lunch celebration being ruined, my friend was ok. Thank goodness!",

I really like PH and see a lot of younger crowds than other places. But anyways we were getting hungry so we though since we're here we can get PF Chang. So we went to PF Chang and had to wait about an hour before we got a table. The place is pretty nice with it's design and look very modern. There's an upstairs but I don't know if you're able to eat up there? Looks nice though.  Okay so we got a table and we decided to start off with Dumpling since the Dumpling I had at another PF Chang was really good. Also we ordered Hot & Sour soup. The dumpling turn out to be average and the soup tasted like...nothing. After we finish with that, I was hoping the food would be better because we're hungry. We ordered Pepper Steak, and Chicken with black bean sauce. Okay so the food came out, we were hungry and began to eat. Then, we all looked at each other like wtf? The Pepper Steak has no flavor at all, and the only flavor was the taste those small black pepper that's you're chewing on. The chicken was bad, but it's not as close as the Pepper Steak. Chicken doesn't have much flavor at all but at least it's more edible.   I can't believe they're in business, I swear this is the worst Chinese Food I'd ever ate. I've ate at PF Chang a few times before and it was decent so they either need a new chef or something because all of the food suck. You ever get that feeling after eating like not being satisfied and wondering if you even ate at all? That's how I felt leaving there like damn, I'm not satisfied and I'm not full. I would give it 2 stars because the place look nice and server was decent but the food is that bad I'm sorry.",

There were empty tables, so I asked her why we had to eat upstairs. She said that they wanted to make the tables evenly distributed between the waiters/waitresses, that if we went upstairs she would make sure we had a table with a great view, so I said okay. The she proceeds to hand me the menus so we could go upstairs ourselves.  Waiting at the top was a young girl, the hostess for upstairs, I guess.  I smile at her & tell her we were told we would get a table with a great view. She looks at me, no expression on her face, says nothing & turns around & starts walking.  We follow her. We walk by the only table left with a view...and she leads us to the very back to a table with no view. I tell her again, we were promised a table with a view. i won't go into details, but that young girl's facial expression & attitude was the worse I have ever experienced.....and I go out to eat a lot. She was both rude & belligerent...not a good combination as hostess. She was obviously having a bad day or hates her job.  Neither speaks well for her or the restaurant manager for hiring her.  Our waiter on the other hand, 5+ stars. His positive attitude saved the day.",

The place was jacked. Placed an order at their take out window and sat down at the last seat on the end of the bar, which was three deep. As crowded as it was, the bartender noticed little ol' me and asked me if I needed anything. When I said I was just waiting for a to-go order, instead of asking me to give my seat up, he gave me a free coke.   Got my food (spring rolls, sesame chicken and dan dan noodles) and took it back to my room. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned and just what the hangover doctor ordered. I thought all chain restaurants were basically the same, but this location had, but far, the best food I've ever had from a PF Chang's, and i've been to about five of them all over California.  If you want really shitty PF Chang's, buried in salt with stale or undercooked rice, served by unapologetic waiters who bring you more of the same when you try to send you dish back, I recommend the one in downtown San Jose. Epically bad. How these two restaurants belong to the same company is one of life's mysteries.",

This was the first PF Changs Restaurant I'd ever been to and since then I have been back twice to the local one here in Houston.  The staff was friendly and nice.  Couldn't be happier with this place.",

    "text": "Because of the heat in Vegas and because of our pure laziness, we had PF Chang's twice - while staying at the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. We ordered it togo one of the days and the other day we ordered it through the hotel's room service. It's seriously the perfect meal when you want decent food and it's pretty yummy.   I have eaten at many PF Chang's - one of my bestie's used to manage one - so I know the menu pretty well. But this time I tried some different foods and now have new faves. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Noodles - spicy and similar to Pad Thai - soba noodles served with sprouts and goodness, Crab Wontons and the Combination Lo Mein. Good times!  We managed to order way too much food and had two meals with one order :) The restaurant itself gets packed since it's right on the strip so if you're staying at PH, go ahead and order to go and enjoy your american style chinese food.   Cheers!",

The service was extremely slow an disorganized (ex. Late arrival of setups, no appetizer dishes with appetizer, and entrees 45 minutes after seating).  My friend's Spicy Chicken was lukewarm and the rice cold, and my Citrus Soy Salmon was tough; all signs of food that had sat under heat lamps for too long. I suspect the restaurant's XO is not exactly on the ball about keeping large volumes of food moving quickly.  On the positive side, our complaints were dealt with courteously, and new entrees delivered in 7 minutes. If it weren't for this handling I would have given this experience one star.",

My wife's pepper steak came but did not taste at all like pepper steak and the beef was tough.  She sent it back and ordered Mongolian beef. The food was cooked perfectly but the sauce was salty. The fried rice was tasty. We have eaten at several PF Chang restaurants and have been exceptionally pleased with the food, but were very disappointed  his time.

We were seated as soon as we walked up, our drink order was taken and received within five minutes and our food arrived shortly after we ordered it.  The waitress was amazing, she was attentive and checked on us often during our meal, never letting our glass go empty.  The food was excellent, and the portions were big enough we even had some leftover for a late night snack!",

Found out after they are new to Canada, and, have opened a location in Toronto (which we are going to try after our experience in Vegas).    Our waiting was cool - young kid from Oregon, working in Vegas.  The crowd there - eclectic.  A little bit of everything.     Our server made the PF Chang 'secret sauce' right at our table for our Spring Roll appetizer.    The 'piece de resistance' was the Mongolian Beef - our entree.  WOW!  Taste explosion!  (and apparently what they're known for)  It's Americanised Chinese food - not authentic, but, still delicious.  Know this going in (for any food snobs - I like traditional Chinese food, as well).  This was one of my favorite meals in Vegas, and, you don't have to break the bank.  Recommended!",

(My hours are reversed and so often getting somewhere for dinner at or just before midnight is a pretty frequent thing, and for that, this place has been good.) Until tonight. This was one of those situations where they had an opportunity to shine and instead completely failed to do anything other than the absolute bare minimum - my two friends and I came out here for my birthday dinner, and frustratingly got locked up in traffic in front of the LINQ for literally more than half an hour, and ended up walking into PF Chang's at 12:05. I explained and said we knew exactly what we wanted, and could order immediately (which would more than make up for the 5 mins too late we were), and they said no. The host said maybe they could do takeout, which we said is at least something, and then he came back and said no. Didn't care if it was for my birthday or not, no effort to go ask someone like a manager or explain to the kitchen or anything like that. Fail. So, the food here is fine, but don't expect good staff or for them to do anything than the bare minimum.",

I understand people have bad days, I work retail so I get it, really I do, but leave it at the door, don't bring your bad attitude to work. The food was ok, nothing to write home about.

You can call ahead from your room too if you are staying at Planet Hollywood or their Towers....   Love their dan dan noodles, candied walnut shrimp, chicken noodle soup, hot and sour soup and their lettuce wrap... We order cashew chicken, lettuce wraps, dan dan noodles and hot and sour soup and it was a good portion...

Once we sat down, the table was dirty, there was food under the table, and the utensils were dirty. After we placed our food order, our server brought out plates and those were dirty too. When she brought out new plates two of them were still dirty. Then we get our egg drop soup (the only good thing) and the chicken lettuce wraps that basically consisted of just water chestnuts and little to no meat. We asked if the gave us the vegetarian lettuce wraps since we couldn't find any meat and the food runner said no chicken so we sent that bad dish back. Once we got our main dishes, Mongolian beef and Changs spicy chicken, the beef was completely burnt and tasted like charcoal and the chicken was overcooked and dry. We told our server the dishes were burnt and not as expected and that the quality was horrible and being busy was not an excuse for poor quality food. The manager was not very apologetic and seemed more disturbed than anything.",

I had the pork lo mein for dinner which was delicious, it was well cooked and well seasoned and I would recommend it to anyone. Appetizers were the steamed pork pot-stickers which were very good, though they suffered from being very common and is not something I would seek out again at this particular location. We also started with PF Changs take on California Rolls which included chopped peanuts and sriracha sauce. The rolls were good however the addition of peanuts and sriracha were completely unneeded and gave them an overdone quality. Finally this restaurant is always extremely busy, the seating is crowded, and it is very loud; reservations are accepted and recommended  however be prepared that even with a reservation it is likely that there will be a wait.",

The pricing is a bit high, but I understand because it is a nicer atmosphere. People rave about their lemon chicken but I think it's a bit average. I don't know... I just don't get the hype.  My coworkers and I went to this location for a dinner meeting and were sat in a very nice, private room. They only left 1 server to deal with all 20 with us, so both food and drink service was very slow. Orders were forgotten and it took over 3 hours for us to eat.",

It was so good that we hope the food will be just as delicious here in San Jose.  Our service was excellent too! Don't know the woman's name, but she saw we had a baby & offered anything we needed for the baby, she'd bring it for us!

The odd thing was that we had tried to eat at the Bellagio, but there were long lines for all the restaurants. We came across the street to try the Burger place at Planet Hollywood, but once again, there was a long line. We see that Chang's had open and available seating so this was our only hope at 2:00 and we have not eaten a meal yet.   The hostess walked us over to what was clearly a dirty table. I couldn't believe it. I told her, \"No, it's dirty.\" She said, \"I know, I'll sweep it\". Um no, that's gross, you won't be sweeping by my feet. How rude. I said no again. So we go to a different table that at first appeared to be clean but had fortune cookie crap in the seats and tons of wrappers around me. Okay. We sit there and she wipes down the tabletop because it needs it.   Then I see that the table next to us is dirty too. There are people finishing up their meal but the mess on the floor appeared to be a prior mess that was never cleaned up (most adults don't leave that type/much mess). When they left the wait staff started stacking dirty dishes in a tray right next to me. It was close enough for me to touch. A variety is staff kept walking back and forth around it almost bumping into my head. Wowsers! So rude folks. I didn't have my food yet so I told my husband to pack my food to go. I just couldn't take it anymore.  I left and found Garrett's Popcorn thank goodness because my husband ended up having stomach problems all night.",

Plenty of really good looking entrees.  I ordered a great dish that was just a tad underwhelming to me.  My fault, I ordered a dish I really wasn't craving. After I received the entree,  I asked George if could \"reboot\" and order the PF Change Chicken \"Sure, no problem\" Within a few minutes, the manager Sierra stopped by to let me know it was no big deal to change my initial order.  She was asking \"rightly so\" the reason for changing my order.  I assured her the initial entree was fine, I just wasn't \"feeling it\" She was very understanding and cool about the whole situation.  George brought me The PF Chicken within 5-10 mins. Awesome!!  Thank you Sierra and George.  I will be back to PF Chang's Planet Hollywood on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

We craved it for the whole year and made sure when in Vegas, we returned.  We checked the balance of our reward cards and we were both able to get our meals at half off. You just tell the server how much cash you have on your card and they deduct it from the bill. To know that, you just visit the rewards desk inside the casino and ask, showing your card and ID. I went for the orange peel shrimp and it did not disappoint. Tangy and delicious. Service was fine. Try and get a seat like we did on the upper level that gives a great view of all the beautiful people/drunks/crazies going by on the Strip. Last year, some alcohol-fueled idiot climbed atop the white huge horse statue out front and - you guessed it, he fell off. And his 'friends' left him there in a heap. You will shake your head and smile through yummy bites, saying \"Only in Vegas!\"",

PF Changs is a massive chain and I've been to them once or twice, I have never eaten anything I thought was great.  But a group of people wanted to go and I was powerless to persuade them to try real Vegas cuisine...  Everything is family style which is cool, and it's fun to poke,and grab little bites from this bowl or that.  We had a variety of items, noodles, chicken, veggies.  Everything was pretty fine.  The spicy green beans were quite good.  Our server was really nice and polite and did a fantastic job taking care of us, I'm sorry I can't recall his name.  Five stars for him and his service.  All in all, the food did the trick, it stopped the hangry in the group, and we moved on, no one mentioning it again.  I feel like that happens a lot when you go to PF Changs.  Eat, move on.  Job done.  If that's what you're looking for, this'll do.  Id prefer some place local next time.",

I'd easily recommend the Mongolian beef and the Tempura with Vegetables (I'm sure the other items taste delicious as well).  The serving size was also great for us as everything just felt right.

Whether the 30 minute wait, even though there were plenty of open tables, or after asking the hostess if they planned on seating us, being shown to a small cramped table, then being ignored for 15 minutes, my taste for PF Chang's may have ended.  I appreciate that Robert the manager tried to salvage the experience, but unfortunately, my mood and appetite had fled.  It's sad when you go from a great, celebratory mood to being unable to enjoy a good meal.",

Especially since it was the first time for some. It was Sunday night so we made reservations and got seated quickly.  The service was okay at first we had an appetizer which came out in good timing and hot but when we ordered our food, we did not get it for an HOUR - which our server informed us that the kitchen was behind (after we asked her) so that was understandable until our food came out and was cold? If the kitchen was behind and the food came out cold then the server just forgot about us and she made up an excuse.. when we informed the server about our food, all she said was it will take a long time to cook again and how we should probably head to the airport (since we had a flight to catch). I couldn't believe how she did not even care to apologize or try and fix the issue. She simply ignored the problem and left us with empty water glasses and cold food. Very disappointed with the service and lack of solving the issue for your customers.",

    "text": "I was a little irritated that I was eating at a chain restaurant while in Las Vegas, but it was my cousin's anniversary dinner so of course, she gets to pick.  After being grumbly about the situation, I actually REALLy enjoyed my meal.  I had just recently eaten at another PF Changs, but this experience was much better.    Because we had two couples we each ordered the meals for two and shared everything.  I had the egg drop soup and it was REALLY good.  I also had a taste of the wonton soup.  Also good, but I do love egg drop soup!  We had these yummy pan fried pork dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps to start and then we all shared the Pepper Steak, Crispy Honey Chicken, Crispy Honey Shrimp, and Mongolian beef.  My cousin also added a noodle dish.  OH MY GOSH!  Way too much food!  But it all tasted really good and we really enjoyed the meal.  There were two boxes of food to take home afterwards.  The service was timely and attentive, even thought the restaurant was quite busy.  We had a reservation, so there was no wait to be seated.    I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone looking for Asian food at the Planet Hollywood.  It's a chain, but it is good, I admit it!  WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS? ~Not be a chain restaurant?  I don't think that's entirely fair, but for me what makes a five star restaurant is something unique.  I can eat at a PF Changs any time, anywhere, so that takes away a little something from the experience.",

We came around noon and at time, it wasn't busy.  First off, our server lacked the intelligence to take our order. I wasn't sure if she didn't understand what we wanted to order or if she wanted us to buy the more expensive dishes in order to get a bigger tip. Either eat, it didn't seem like she cared of providing good service.  The food was god awful. Everything was dry and had little to no flavor. The rice that came with the dishes were extremely dry. If I were blindfolded and eating their rice and bits of paper, I wouldn't have known the difference. We ordered the salmon and asked it to be cooked well. It came out with the inside still pink/slightly cooked.   Overall, everything was poor. I enjoyed the restaurants decor. That's a plus.",

    "text": "Lord smite me now, cuz I never thought I'd see a day where I'd give L'Atelier Joel Robuchoun two stars and PF Chang's a three, but karma dictates that I follow up a crap review with a glowing one, which is what my review of PF Changs at Planet Hollywood on the Vegas Strip is all about.  Now, I KNOW PF Chang's is about \"fusion\" (read - fake) Chinese/Asian food, and I KNOW they're a chain, but they have tasty (albeit really salty) food, at reasonable prices - even on the Vegas Strip.  During our four-day stay, we dined here twice - once late night for some noodles and egg rolls; and the second for happy hour (3:30pm to 6:30pm).  The first experience, when we sat in the dining room on the main floor, was OK, but the second time, when we sat at the upstairs (YES, THERE'S AN UPSTAIRS BAR) with bartender Brandon, our server, was even better.  Without a doubt, Brandon was the most sincere and professional service person we've met up on our Vegas trip.  Everywhere you go on the Strip, from the baristas at Starbucks to the guys hustling shows on the overpasses to the check-in clerks at your hotels - people are wanting something from you (ie. Tips) and you get fake, effusive service as a result.  Not Brandon.  He was swamped with drinks, being the only bartender for the entire two-floor restaurant, but kept his humor and gave us great service.  We had HH chicken lettuce wraps (always great), northern style spareribs (just ok), and egg rolls (just ok), as well as the Organic Agave Margaritas, which were great.  (And cheaper during HH!)  I'm so glad our last night in Vegas was spent at that bar with Brandon; he made the experience of being there a little more memorable.",

So to start off we are waiting to be seated the hostess trys to stop one of the waitress to seat us and she mumbles something back in the lines of she is busy so the hostess starts to seat us and another waiter jumped in and seated us. It took about 10 mins before waitress came and took our drink and food order. We get our soup and i ask for the won ton strips takes almost 10 mins for that and us to get straws that we didnt get when we got our drinks. The servers says sorry about the wait on the strips were busy....now my husbamd and i look around and wonder how are they busy? Yjere was not a lot of people in the resturant at the time, maybe 7-10 at the most. After the soup and lettuce wrap which is hands down my favorite thing the resturant serves this dish is amazing the balance between the chicken and water chesnuts is perfect.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice which he enjoyed but he said it could of had a feew more shrimp in it bit overall grest dish. I ordered the pepper steak it was a little on the salty side and not hot like it just came off the stove asaid from that it was good. The desert was a fav of mine i order it from where ever serves it tiramisu, the portion wad small for it to be a shareable dessert we did the changs for 2 for 44.95 so its a good thing my husband does not eat dessert.  It took forever after i ordered it for it to come, my biggest complaint was the slow service, she told us 2 different times our food was on its way out and it never came til 15 mins after the first time she told us. Not my worst experience at a restaurant but not the best either",

I'm sure he was just trying to be sure we were having a nice stay but he just did a lot of talking when we wanted to have a nice lunch to ourselves.  So not really anything wrong, just too much.

    "text": "We tried their Mongolian beef and their Kung pao shrimp for dinner, and had some sort of fried wonton dish for appetizers.  The flavors are ok for a fusion type place but it was on the salty side.  We drank more soda and ate more rice to compensate for the saltiness.  The bright side was the servers were great.  All were working as a team and bringing/removing plates/drinks etc.  We'd go back on a less hectic day to try them again before we write them off since their servers were awesome.",

My regular order is Kung Pao shrimp and garlic string beans. However I have found over several trips both these dishes to be too salty (abundant use of soy sauce) so i am not pleased about that. Otherwise this place is awesome.",

    "text": "As I write this I am still sitting here waiting for my check! My food has been done for almost 20 minutes yet, my rude waitress seems to careless! Let me start from the beginning...I am a vegetarian and this menu is only for those who like tofu! I can tolerate tofu but, don't prefer it as a main source of meat replacement. Do the main chefs at PF Chang's not care about the vegetarian or vegan consumers or think we all love tofu?? I have news for them that this is not the case and the options on their menu suck!!  When I did ask my ever so pleasant waitress about a vegetarian dish her response was about the same as I received upon her arrival to my table...a roll of the eyes and a \" I don't like tofu\".  So, instead of helping me when I asked her what the dish was like I received her personal opinion. I ended up with the vegetarian lettuce wraps. I was informed we can't make the sauce at the table anymore so I ended up with a bland runny wrap sauce for my wraps!! Thank you again PF Chang's! So as I sit here I contemplate the rating to give and usually give 5 stars to those who deserve it yet, in this case I feel two is fair. You were not the worst but, have fallen far beyond your glory days and have a long way to go before I will walk through this door again.",

Servers fight with each other and there is a lack of communication between servers. By the time I received my complete order everything else was cold. I would stay away from this location. Enjoy your hometown location and keep that image alive.",

We had the lemongrass prawns & garlic noodles; sauteed spinach; spring rolls, and steamed dumplings.  That was more than enough for 2 for lunch.  I had a Lucky Cat Martini. OMG super delicious.   Justin, our server, was really nice, prompt, and funny, too, with the little jokes.  I always return to P.F. Changs for consistent, quick, asian bistro food. Its delicious.",

For starters we ordered the Ahi tartare with avocado and the dynamite scallop roll. Then we shared two entrees; chicken pad thai and Chang's spicy chicken. All of our food was delicious and the service was pretty good.",

    "text": "Although service here was prompt for a busy Saturday night,  we placed our order for a dinner for two priced at 49.95 per the menu.  After dinner the waitress asked if we were ready for desert, some Banana rolls.  We declined and she insisted.  I said no really and she says no, you have to try them.  Again we said no thank you and she says well I have to bring it out, but it's ok you'll love it! When she brought our tab, it was charged per item, including the dessert we declined but was supposed to be a part of the dinner for two. When brought to her attention, she quickly blamed her manager for doing it all wrong.  She came back with it still wrong and again blames her manager.  Finally, the matter is rectified.  We leave our monies and tip on the table, as well as two untouched desserts, and leave.  She then proceeds to chasing our friend out into the casino accusing him of shorting her and announces she will not cover him! Embarrassed, he goes back in with her, assuring her he left her the right amount and a tip.  He asks her to show her the folder and she can't find it.  The manager dismisses it since she can't prove anything.  What an odyssey!  I recommend trying other culinary adventures while Sin City!",

There was no reservation whatsoever at this place so WTF?????",

Located at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino, and along the strip, it's easy enough to locate if you're in the mood.  But with so many great restaurants all nearby, I'd skip this place.  My main problem with this restaurant is it's poorly managed.  The food is as good as any PFChangs but the people don't seem to care and the manager doesn't follow instructions very well at all.  A group of 40, we had done countless emails back and forth with directions on what we wanted and what time we'd be there.  Of course when we arrived, they weren't ready for us and on top of that, the menu was wrong.  Tighten the screws people!",

I don't overly love it, there are a million places on the strip that I personally would rather go to for lunch but this PF's is a favourite of my other half. I swear if there were loyalty rewards for lifetime achievement of Hot & Sour soup consumption, he would win!  So, inevitably I end up here at least a few times a year. Here are the things on the menu I can recommend for your day after, tequila soaked tummy: Won ton soup, chicken lettuce wraps, Kung-Pow chicken and I do like the mango chicken even though the sauce resembles a colour not naturally found in nature. Oh there is a very extensive Gluten Free menu, so props to that.   **Note none of these dishes are overly authentic. For a much better Asian nosh head across the street to Noodles in the Bellagio.  However, it will cost you double!",

We normally get the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef and it was flavored just right, not over-salted. The appetizers came out quickly, the food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Even the front of the house manager was nice enough to check in on us right before dessert. We got to sit outside which provided some great people-watching! Big kudos to the team here at PF Chang's. You guys are awesome!",
