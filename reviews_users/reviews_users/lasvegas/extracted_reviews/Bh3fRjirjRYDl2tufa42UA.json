The rice was bland, and the enchiladas were not prepared like enchiladas but more like mushrooms thrown into a cold tortilla and then some sauce poured onto it not even covering it. The tortillas tasted nice but that was about it. The horchata was not great either. I might give it another chance and hope that it was just the one bad experience. The staff was great though.",

The baja tacos were amazing and i loved the texture, it was crunchy and just really good. Its hard to think that this place serves all vegan food. Im not vegan, but i found the food to be very flavorful. The churros blew my face off, it was so fresh and warm it couldn't be any better. I also tried their ice cream and it was so good, it was coconut based and is sourced locally which is awesome. The staff were so kind, they seemed to really care about us having a good experience.  It is a great grab and go spot for anytime of the day, if only they can be open 24 hours lol Overall, the food was great and everyone was really friendly. I have to go back and try everything else, they really exceeded my expectations it was great.",

The only dessert we tried was arroz con leche, which was great. All the food was delicious, but we especially loved the gabacho, carne asada, and baja tacos!",

He read Tacotarian off the receipt and I asked if he enjoyed the tacos and he said they were great. I then broke the news to him that he had just eaten vegan tacos without even realizing it!

    "text": "Let me start by saying I love tacos and tacos are life. I went to this place today on a recommendation. I am pro taco in every way, meaning I eat all types, meat, tongue, veg, intestine etc. tacos. This place is dope! I checked out the menu before I got there so that I wouldn't have to stand in line too long deciding. They have it all, and not just tacos but burritos, enchiladas, nachos and all manner of vegan Mexican options. Its crazy how good the menu is. their beverage selection is equally impressive. I will say I was disappointed that I couldn't get plain unsweetened ice tea, but the girl at the counter was awesome and upsold me beer! not only did she recommend beer, but went the next step and offered a sample to seal the deal. Really, don't tacos and beer just go together? yes, yes they do! Now, since this was my first time, you're probably thinking I only ordered a couple tacos to make sure I liked the place, wrong!! I ordered 4 different tacos, chips and salsa and that tasty cold beer. The first taco I ordered was the Gabacho, with seasoned beyond beef (insert trademark) lettuce, cheddar, crema and pico in a crispy corn tortilla. This one was delicious and very reminiscent of a Taco Bell taco, and that's not a bad thing because at 3 am you need tasty options. I then ordered the Barbacoa, which came with chili-braised jackfruit, onion and cilantro in a flour tortilla. Incredible, just incredible! jackfruit is my new jam! Thirdly, I think that's a word, I ordered the Dorado, deep fried mash potato, cheddar, lettuce, pico and crema in a crispy shell. This was good but not my favorite. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but in a taco competition it would be a runner up. My last taco was the Baja, deep fried avocado, cilantro-lime slaw, guac, pico and salsa Morita. Ding Ding Ding, this was the winner! I loved every taco I had but this was the best of the four I chose. everything on it played to the other ingredient, it was culinary magic in my mouth! I accompanied all of these tacos with chips and salsa. The chips were definitely made in house, crispy with just the right amount of salt, and paired with fresh salsa. Now I like my salsa spicy and this one wasn't but it was delicious and I was able to spice it up with 1 of 4 hot sauces they offer. I'll go into those on my next review. We got there too early for happy hour, which starts at 3, but it was well worth what we paid. Speaking of that, the prices are incredibly good considering the quality of food and the location. They aren't on the East side where I drove from, no, they are on the Southwest side of the valley where the rent runs a little higher. The girl who took our order was fantastic. I mentioned the upsell earlier. She was friendly and helpful and even recognized the band t shirt I was wearing, commenting on how she has seen them perform. I love when people make it personal. Overall this place is amazing and I will definitely be back and will also recommend it to all of my friends.",

We finally have the type of Mexican joint that I have been waiting for in Las Vegas, and it happens to be down the street from me. The tacos were on the small side, but very good! (can't wait to try them all). The burrito and the rice and beans were all tasty. And the dessert! Finally, vegan conchas!!! Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!",

My children had the quesadillas, which I, of course, sampled. My partner had a regular burrito with the asada. There is another restaurant with asada that I find to be awful. Tacotarian actually does a good job with it. The cheese tasted like the real thing. The horchata was delicious. I highly recommend this place. My only complaints were the slow service and that they are so far away from my house (one which they can't control, so I'm whining because they are so good.)",

I had the asada burrito, which was a real novelty as I have never seen a vegetarian version and always wanted to try it (I live in California). It was huge and delicious and we could not believe it was vegan! We also tried a couple of the tacos and the rice and beans. Everything was great. I love the number of options on the menu. The staff was incredibly kind as well. It's also dog-friendly--there is outdoor seating and a water bowl for dogs. The only bad thing is if you are visiting Vegas it's probably a bit far. We went on the way back to CA so it wasn't too far off-track. Even if it's not on the way anywhere, it's totally worth the trek! I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas.",

And way tastier, in my opinion!  Their overall variety is pretty awesome, as well as their activity in the Vegas community and events. I had one of their special tortas from the Veganuary (January 2019) special menu and was so in love .   The prices are also alright. They often offer specials that you can find more information about through Instagram. I'm looking forward to trying brunch there one of these days. It's also right near my house, so I often swing by for to-go orders.",

My BIL ordered 5 tacos, he loved them all! I only tasted the Super Taco which was phenomenal. He would have ordered 5 more tacos if we had let him. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!  Note- the place is small and casual, order at the front and take a number. Bright, lots of natural light and cute plants, has a very PNW vibe to it in a way that I love.",

Baja - Deep fried avocado with plenty of add-ons and a cream sauce that was very light and frothy and just the way to top of this outstanding substitute for a fish taco.  Not that it needs to be a substitute at all, it was way good.    Chorizo - I was a big big fan.  The chorizo flavor was there and I thought it nailed the flavor pretty spot on for the first Taco.  My fiancee thought the flavor was a little off and I thought so too on the 2nd one (so good that I ordered another). But it wasn't so off that I didn't thoroughly enjoy it.    Pastor - a quality replacement for an Al Pastor Taco and very good if you're an al pastor fan.  But I did think the previous tacos above were better.  Again, not that the al pastor wasn't good.  It was.  You wouldn't go wrong by ordering it over the others.    Service was top top notch.   We came for our birthdays and were treated to free dessert which was an almond milk \"ice cream\".   The flavor was Churro and it was very good.  We also made a mistake during our order and the staff happily hooked us up when making up for OUR mistake.  We tried insisting that we were the ones that screwed up, but they wouldn't let us pay for the correction.  They were so nice!    Definitely going back.",

For the moment I walked through the doors, I felt welcomed... the Customer service was great and the environment was awesome as well. I had the Cali Burrito it come with rice, black beans and small salad and WOW...One of the best burrito I have ever had the rice and beans were good and I liked the salad. I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in Las Vegas. Sorry no food pics I was to busy enjoying it!!",

My girlfriend and I went for $1.99 taco Tuesday without really knowing what to expect. But here's what I concluded after my experience:  WHAT I ORDERED * veggie taco - 5/5 * mushroom taco - 4/5 * bean & cheese taco - 5/5  PROS + $1.99 taco Tuesday, yes please! + super cute little place, welcoming environment  + entire staff was on their A game, you all rock! + flavor, flavor FLAVOR, it's like a party in your mouth (yeah I said it) need I say more?  CONS - I live in Henderson, or as my Summerlin friend would say, \"Hender-tucky\" so it was a good 20 minute drive for me  Thanks Tacotarian for bringing awesome vegan food to our community!  I'll be back next, Tuesday =)",

I inhaled 3 at the speed of light, and grudgingly gave my boyfriend a bite so he would believe me on how yummy they were lol. Definitely adding you guys to the top of our date night list!",

Zia and Skylar were extremely friendly and helpful in making choices from this enticing menu. Once you sink into a bite of this food, it makes you want to try it all! There is a jimaca margarita!!

(Sorry forgot the names) Solely vegan options, but they are pretty freaking good. I was also surprised that the prices weren't outrageous like most vegan joints are. I want to try their desserts next time!   Service was a bit slow, and I was only one of 3 customers  in the whole restaurant",

Today I had the \"Cali Burrito\" to be specific. .. this is my favorite item of the menu... today, lol. I cant tell you how i will feel next week, but I bet I'll come find out.  The environment is amazing, great playlist, awesome wall paper and decorations. Old Cantinflas movies projecting, takes me back to childhood, I can actually hear my pops laughing as i sit here... which makes it that much more enjoyable.  The people that work here have all been great. And i find the people that come to eat here are open minded, upbeat, and have a great vibe; which makes for a great eating experience.  Tacotarian a complete delight. I will continue to try the vast menu, however, I think im set with the Cali Burrito. Thank you to those the work there to bring a most excellent experience.",

We ordered different tacos (Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Beef, Bean/Cheeze) and the green enchiladas. The tacos were great. The tortillas are Store bought but go well with the flavors.  Green enchiladas weren't are favorite. They use mash potatoes instead of some protein..green sauce could have used more seasoning as well.  We had the free iced water self serve. They put limes with the pitcher.  Overall if I'm in the area I'll return for a quick bite but won't go out of my way to come here since we live in southern highlands.  We have a 4 stars because service was stellar and food was good.",

The super taco is a fun idea and great if you miss eating the meat tacos at taco bell, it's very similar. The pastor taco is loaded with yummy toppings and the jackfruit taco is sort of sweet. I'd say the pastor was my fave. The asada fries were sooooo good! Crispy fries, the asada is very good and seasoned well and the guac and other toppings were all delicious. Hubs loved his burrito and said the rice and beans on the side were very good. I would love to come back and try all of the tacos and I need to pick up one of those cool Tacotarian hats.",

Taco One... fried avocado taco. Do I really need to say more? I think I said the three most beautiful words in the English language just now. Flour tortillas with an avocado crema, what seemed like a chipotle aioli and some cabbage on top of a batteries and fried piece of avocado. Awesome.  Taco Two... soyrizo taco. Double corn tortilla and soyrizo. Lots of flavor and spice and just brought me to a happy place.  Taco Three... beyond meat taco. Standard fast food taco made vegan. Lettuce, cheese in a crispy shell. I felt like the flavor could've had a little more seasoning but that's a personal preference. I should have put some cholula on that bad boy.  Taki's Street corn... holy cabooses! This brought me back. Crushed spicy Taki's and cotija with what tasted like a chipotle sauce. Spicy, creamy, crunchy..delish. Order it on or off the cob. Yum.  I should've tried the desserts because..dessert, but I was really full by that time.  I cannot wait to go back.  They do sell margaritas and craft beer as well!   Great Job!

Hip and trendy interior design with a wall dedicated to \"market\" items for sale. Lunch hour was bustling and the ala carte tacos seemed to be the popular vote. I used my Yelp check-in for the free Agua Fresca (ordered the horchata) it was gritty upon the few sips and seemed too watered down, so I stuck with the fruit-infused water. I ordered a side of guacamole and refried beans - they were wonderful, and tried their version of al pastor, veggie and barbacoa tacos - all made to order in mini corn soft tacos. Only $12! I'm excited to try more off the menu and a different Agua Fresca.",

    "text": "Today was my first time trying the place out. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I looked at the menu and everything looked great so I decided to try it out.  1. Mushroom Taco- very delicious and I love the yellow tortilla they used and the salsa roja I added on top really made it taste flavorful. The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't a lot of mushrooms in my taco, it was two medium sized tortillas with a very small amount of mushrooms in the middle, for $2.95 I think it should have just a tad bit more but other than that I'd definitely order it again.  2. I tried the flautas de papa. OMG. Freaking amazing!!! Iv tried plenty of flautas in my life but these are literally the best Iv ever had. Now Iv made tacos de papa but never with flautas. It's genius. What ever sauce is on top of them is life. I'd like to buy that by the jar please  3. I ordered Jamaica for my drink and again best Iv tried. It was perfectly sweet and just right.  4. The Churros. I was looking forward to trying these since Iv been craving them. Sadly disappointed. They were rock hard. Not fresh whatsoever and I didn't like the chocolate sauce that came with it I prefer caramel. For the price tag of almost $4 I was very sad. Maybe next time they will be better / freshly hot. This is why I can't give it a 5 stars but lm definitely coming back and trying more things. .  The fact that they play Cantinflas through a projector is awesome! If you have ever watched Cantinflas you'll know why. I loved the atmosphere the music the decor. Very clean. Very warm. Everyone was very nice. I was pretty impressed all in all.",

They classify as a Mexican restaurant but they also have burgers on their menu- both the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Meat Burger. So many options with their tacos and different proteins. I got a burrito bowl and it was so delicious and filling. I could only eat half and got to bring the rest home. Our server, Tanner, was very kind and helpful in helping me decide what to order. I will definitely be going back to this place.",

I'm not 100% vegan myself, but this place makes amazing Mexican-vegan cuisine! I just wish that they would make a location closer to home for myself.   I've tried the Chicken Milanesa, Carne Asada, Bean and Cheese, and Gabacho tacos. They are all delicious. The cashew based nacho cheese sauce they use is spot on! The Gabacho is their most famous taco. It truly does resemble a traditional taco with a hard taco shell and they use beyond meat which supposed to simulate ground beef. Worth a try, in my opinion   Please do yourself a favor and give Tacotarian a try! Love the reggae music vibes they got going on that gives a classic taco truck and beach vibe!",

Ate it without their salsa to be able to taste their seitan protein and mole sauce. Will have to come back. Slow cashier today but food came out fast. Get another register and lemme order on my own to get my food faster, lol. Anyhoo a little warm in the place pump up the AC volume so it's more relaxed. Need to have floor more clean in front and bathroom to show off nice tiles.  Funny their menu boards are behind a low overhang, u don't see it until ur 5 feet from the counter. Just my observation but food is good. Pls open up in Summerlin on Charleston and Town Center would be perfect for me lol.",

I think it's lame when a vegan restaurant tries to \"replace\" meat with soy meat options. What's wrong with vegetables? Tacotarian offers a good selection of vegetable-based options for your taco or burrito craving. Their carne asada fries are bomb- fries are well crisped. Good portions and good prices. I hope to come every Tuesday if I can and during Happy Hour as well!",

The owner was very apologetic and empathetic to how I was feeling. His customer service and how he handled the very upsetting situation was extremely satisfying and worthy of commending his business practice.

    "text": "Best vegan taco shop in the Southwest area! I'm so excited to have this place literally 3 minutes away from home. Yesterday my husband and I both tried the Cali burrito with al pastor mock meat and we were both surprised on how much they pack into these bad boys. Unlike other reviews that say they don't guacamole to the burrito, they do. Plus they give you a little on the side. Im so bummed I didn't take a picture to show y'all! The burrito is pretty pricey but it's seriously the size of my head and the also give you beans and rice on the side.  Honestly everything tasted well and was made to order. I took my order to go and when I go home everything was still warm. For a vegan burrito this one hit the spot. I've tried so many Mexican vegan places and some do disappoint however I think this place is trying really hard to cater to vegans and non vegans. My husband loved his burrito and he is not vegan.  As far as the service goes, the lady who took my order was very nice, she even gave me sample \"meat\" to try. Next time we go I really want to try the concha loca because the conchas on display looked amazing! Make sure to check in to get your free agua fresca, unfortunately I paid for mine since I didn't realize they were having this offer. No big deal, until next time!",

They recently added brunch on Sundays only 10-2 which seems wildly popular. Hopefully they will offer this brunch on Saturday's as well or at least a breakfast burrito option daily because it is sooooo good. This is a fully vegan restaurant with lots of vegan beers and some liquor offerings as well. I've brought several friends and family members here on numerous occasions, none of them vegetarian or vegan, and they all LOVE this place. Things as simple as their black beans are even delicious. I've tried 90% of their menu and there's nothing I wouldn't order again. Favorite menu items are al pastor tacos, chicken milanesa tacos, flautas, california burrito.

The al pastor wasn't that good, but everything else was amazing! They took a while to bring the burrito out, but when they did they apologized and gave us a $5 gift card for the inconvenience.

    "text": "It's like \"Vege-tarian\"...right?..., but with Taco! That's cute, but how good could veggie tacos be? Turns out they can be very good!  6 of us came here on a Sunday just before 2pm. It was right after yoga, so we were very hungry and ready to tackle the menu.   Throughout our visit, we were serenaded by a beautiful voice, named Haley, who was performing during their Brunch. We grabbed a table and looked at the menu. It's a simple double-sided menu.  My brother who came here few times before told us that there are always a line during dinner time so I felt lucky that we had seats on the tail-end of their brunch.  It's really quite simple if you know what you want:     1. Go to the counter to order and pay    2. Get the number    3. Grab a seat    4. Wait    5. Enjoy   As this was my first time here, I took my time to grab a table first and take my time with the menu. The service was quick and smooth on out visit, but my brother mentioned it could be slow...a lot slower. So be patient because everything we ordered was delicious and full of flavor.   Would I come back?  Yes...but maybe not to right away. Vegetarian tacos are certainly healthier than stand varieties, just as vegetarian diets may be considerably healthier than carnivorous diets, but I'm not really of fan of carbs, and tacos, for that same reason,...so while I really enjoyed the flavors of the tacos I had, such as the double layered Super Taco...it's not really in my wheelhouse for regular eating. In addition to the Super Taco, I'd also recommend the Baja and the Pastor tacos. So even if I'm not rushing back, It is really great to know that you can eat something so flavorful in vegetarian dishes!!! If you happen to be vegetarian you need to check Tacotarian out! And even if you're not vegetarian, if you like tacos, then you still must check Tacotarian out! Bottom line: Go for it!  -2019 review #1-",

I follow a group on Facebook (Las Vegas Vegans) that post recommendation on Vegan eateries through out the valley. One of the followers posted that Tacotarian has $1 taquitos on Wednesday's . Based on this I decided to search in google maps and by the grace of kindness I was just 2 miles away. Called my order for pick-up after reviewing the menu online. I was not disappointed! I can honestly say this is the first meal in the month of being Vegan that has satisfy me entirely! Me and my daughter shared the Carne Asada Fries. The price was amazing $7 dollars and change. The ambiance is lovely, the decor unique, modern, yet cozy.  The reason why the 5th is missing is the following... I am a True believer in not only good food but great guest experience. When I came in no one acknowledged me, did not even make eye contact, I stood for a good minute or two without anyone saying a word. The whole thing was very transactional. It is a shame truly. I hope that on my second visit they make amends.",

Kinda bland by itself.  They also serve alcohol &  Kombucha!  Tacotarian has the cutest decor... plants and aztech patterned tiles. They were even for projecting an old movie on the wall!

This is in my side of town, so it is very convenient for me.   This is an order first and then sit down restaurant. First, I ordered the sopa de fideo soup. The soup came with a lime and it was delicious! I also ordered the flautas (that comes with rice and beans), they were very good. My boyfriend got the baja taco (beer battered avocado with guacamole and lettuce) he said that is was okay and he liked the al pastor taco a lot better. The California burrito with French fries inside was amazing! The flavors were good and you can tell the food they use is fresh.   One of the employees was passing out coffee kombucha samples to each table that was SO good. That was a nice little bonus!  Pros: decor, clean/bright, music (they had a really cool cover playlist playing), service, WiFi available, instagram \"worthy\" spot with a sombrero on the wall which is fun, full vegan menu, friendly staff   Cons: can't think of any   Tips** i recommend trying to coffee kombucha   Overall, i can't wait to go back and try more things like the desserts and the elotes!",

    "text": "While I'm not now nor will I ever become a vegetarian let alone a vegan, I've always tried to be very open-minded about food.  As a result, the wife and I decided to give Tacotarian a try on a Wednesday afternoon especially since we were both in the mood for something a bit lighter and healthier for lunch.  Plus, I was very curious about Tacotarian's vegan tacos since I do love me some tacos.  Tacotarian possessed a welcoming, bright, cheery, if not a bit quirky, aesthetic that was a welcome antithesis to a Chipotle or Taco Bell.  Orders were taken at the counter.  I had their vegan renditions of Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and Barbacoa tacos.  We shared an order of chips and guacamole.  Our food was delivered out to our table after a brief wait.  The al pastor and barbacoa came closest in terms of appearance and texture to approximating their meat-based counterparts.  It took a real stretch to imagine the vegan carne asada as True carne asada.  That said, the truly important thing to me was its taste.  All three of my tacos were damn tasty, hearty, satisfying, and possessed the requisite spice and seasoning notes that one would expect from meat-based tacos.  In truth, though, my wife's Mushroom Asada taco, which I had a small bite, was pretty amazing and the best of bunch of tacos ordered by the both of us.  While it may not have been made fresh to order, the chunky guacamole was obviously made with fresh ingredients earlier in the day as advertised on the menu.  It looked and tasted good.  Tacotarian really served up a pleasant surprise.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  While it was a tall, frankly impossible, order to imitate actual meat, its vegan alternatives to animal-based proteins were prepared in such a way that it really hit the right flavor note that made for a satisfying experience and, best of all, didn't make me wish it was actual meat.  Tacotarian had a lot more on its menu besides tacos, so I can see myself coming back in the near future to try more.",

We stopped by today and I can definitely see why he loves their food so much. Everything we ordered was so delicious. We ordered a couple of tacos, guacamole, quesadillas and arroz con leche.  I ordered the carne asada, the barbacoa, the baja and the chorizo taco. I also ordered guacamole to start off because I loooove guacamole. Their guacamole was so fresh and so delicious with some chunks of avocado. I liked the carne asada and chorizo tacos. The flavors were so on point. I have to say my favorite is the baja taco. The deep fried avocado and the sauce on it was just so good. I was too full to eat the barbacoa taco but my son assures me it's yummy. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to visit and eat here again. I love the vibe of the restaurant and the food is delicious!",

They do have a variety of hot sauces but I thought the \"meat portion\" should be more seasoned and flavorful that's why they lost a star. I also had a hard time differentiating between the two taco meats. The winner of the meal was definitely the hibiscus margarita. It was soo tasty and refreshing and the salt rim had a sugary sauce underneath that was nice. The vibe inside this place was cute and I love finding local gems in random shopping centers. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. I'd definitely come back",

Also, I have to rave about the plantain taco because it was the best taco I've ever had hands down. I can't think of another place that has a better taco now that I've had the plantain mole taco. I've also had the enchiladas and California burrito and they are awesome. Even for someone who's not vegan, like myself, I LOVE this place and it makes me consider going vegan because of how good it is here. Everyone needs to try this place ASAP.

Like homemade or higher quality.   El pastor taco: my favorite. Hands down delicious, flavorful and hit the spot.  Gabacho: second favorite. Anyone that says it tastes like a Taco Bell taco is right, but who the hell is bothered by that!  Dorado: classic potato taco with nice crispyness and smooth flavor. Solid choice.  No carne Asada: I wanted to love this. This is always my go to but it fell short. Didn't have that classic spice or citrus notes I was hoping for. I'm sure they will be able to perfect in the next few weeks they are open.  Chicharron: I was expecting it to be fried instead for soft since I know it's reflecting the plant based version of pork fat. Freaked me out to eat lol but wasn't bad. Just needed more spice.  Mushroom asada: I don't like mushroom unless overly flavored and I couldn't take more than a bite of this. Don't take my review of it, I'm biased.   Frito pie: delicious, can't go wrong. Tasty, flavorful and reminds me of childhood.   Takis elote: needed a ton more flavor. I'm a spice person so would have liked either chili powder or more takis. Just fell short for us.   Also their salsa is nice and mild. I will have to ask for some hot stuff next time!   Service hands down was amazing cause they were all so kind and helpful. I see them doing very well. Especially with all the helpful reviews! Thank you for helping the world appreciate plant based food one taco at a time!",

The owners and chef were there on premises and were friendly and helpful guiding me through the menu.     I like Pancho's vegan tacos, but you really can't compare them to Tacotarian's food.  Pancho's is taqueria style, fake meat, very simple.  Nothing wrong with that.  This place has different sauces and garnishes and veggies and isn't all just seitan fake meat like Pancho's.   Again, nothing wrong with seitan, but this place is just several cuts above.    The nacho cheese sauce is frigging amazing.  I can't believe it's vegan.  I also loved the baja taco and \"al pastor\".     I loved everything that our table ordered and will surely be back!   There were a few hi lips getting the food, but the place is tiny and it was very busy and they just opened so I give them a pass this time.",

I think a huge part of what makes good Mexican food is a good tortilla. We ordered three tacos, which were of street taco size, and when they're this size, I expect them to have two layers of tortilla. More importantly, I expect them to be soft. It was half toasted, which is fine because this is merely a preference. In other news, TRY THE AL PASTOR! I think they really nailed that one. My partner enjoys the No Carne Asada taco. The chorizo wasn't bad either.  We also had the Cali burrito with barbacoa--it's made of jackfruit and the flavor and texture is great! It's actually some of the best jackfruit I've ever had at a restaurant. Also, who doesn't love fries in a burrito?! We had some complimentary coffee kombucha which I really enjoyed. For dessert, we tried a chocolate concha with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles. It was a good way to end the meal.   Overall, the only disappointment I had was the lack of pollo as a \"meat\"/filling and the fact that there is no horchata. Everything else is great! Can't wait to try the churros and the taki elote. The decor is quite lovely, too. We'll definitely be back! ...Wait, did I mention this place 100% vegan? Two thumbs up from me!!",

Food comes out super fast. They have margaritas. Deserts. 100% Plant Based no worries of cross contamination for vegans. No dairy. No eggs. No meat. And this stuff is so good if a non vegan comes here. They wouldn't even know. Fritos nachos are rad. I haven't had Fritos since elementary school. The owners and family that work here are great. Seems like a great place to get quick take out. House made salsa with habaneros. Everything was truly great. I can't say enough about this little spot on the west side of Las Vegas that is doing big things.",

Here are the items I tried: Al pastor taco -  it was really good Gazpacho - A close second  Super taco- hands down my favorite Baja taco - they hit the nail on the head w the flavors.  I wasn't loving the fish substitute tho.  It was a little mushy but the rest was really good.  Nachos:  I probly wouldn't order this again.  Was kind of basic.  In my opinion the tacos are the big hit.  They gave me two salsas.  Both were freshly made and delicious.  Great job on this place!",

So so so good. if you like mexican food and eating plant based goodness that is good for you, the animals, and the environment, then look no further- this is your place! so many options, good sized menu with a lot of variety. my favorites are: the super taco!!! the mushroom taco. the jackfruit taco. whatever you do, order the super taco --- sooo good. and the prices are cheap, so try a few.  cute clean setting with a nice friendly staff who will help answer any questions you have about the menu  i have to tell a story about their service as well. i ordered on postmates the other day- my order was about 12 items total. once i got my order, i looked in the bag and they had forgotten my 4 super tacos!!! i called Tacotarian right away and they were waiting for my call (as they didn't have my number since i ordered through postmates) the lady on the phone was very apologetic, said the tacos we're sitting right there and they we're so sorry about the mistake and asked for my address and said they would deliver the tacos themselves and refund me for the inconvenience. i said a refund wasn't necessary, but gave them my address. 15 minutes later a guy delivered me not only my 4 super tacos- but ALSO 4 extra super tacos as well as two $5 coupons for my next visit. very nice of them to do that as i know it's easy to make mistakes. i just really appreciated how sorry they we're and that they didn't hesitate to make it right- and then some! thank you Tacotarian!!",

I saw my friend post about this place on Instagram and I knew I would have to try it. I had 3 tacos the Gabacho, The Dorado, and the veggie. The Gabacho uses beyond meat and it tasted just like meat! The Dorado was my favorite but all of the tacos I scored 8.9 or higher. My husband got the Cali burrito and loved it! Usually he doesn't like to try vegetarian let alone vegan options so this was a huge win! I also got the strawberry margarita and it was delicious! My only small complaint was the margarita had too much ice. Overall our meals were a 10 and we can't wait to come back!  The ambience/ atmosphere was cozy and modern, you order at the counter and they bring you drinks and your food. Service is very f  I woke up craving my more tacos! I would HIGHLY recommend trying this place even if you are a meat lover!   I forgot to mention we tried all of their ice cream and got the fried Oreos. OH MY LORD I died and went to heaven! I don't even like chocolate and the fried Oreos were one of the best desserts I've EVER had!",

I went to get salsa and the bottle was empty. They only have 3 heat level bottles and they can't even refill them!",

I lost count how many times I have been here in the short few weeks I found the gem, but I have been telling everyone about this place. I am not a Vegan, but I wanted to see how the food tasted. I was raised vegetarian, but I do eat chicken, and getting sick of chicken, I wanted to try this place. My friend and I came here and we both loved it. The flavors are amazing, the tortillas are to die for, and I am not sure what meat, besides chicken, tastes like, but this is the best thing I have ever had. I need to try the other things on the menu, but once I Love something, I usually stick to it. I have tried the al pastor, veggie, dorado, and Baja. All amazing, but hands down the al pastor is my favorite. I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. I will definitely be back, since I just went today. I highly recommend this place!",

I have a pretty firm rule when it comes to establishments that serve Pancakes...I HAVE TO TRY THEM...LOL...simple rule right. Well, these didn't disappoint and since I had a feeling they only serve them for Sunday Brunch (and I was correct by the way) well I had to try them. While not as good as some Pancakes at I had a Bob's Red Mill in Oregon...these certainly were a close 2nd. They were very light and served with Vegan Butter, Blueberry Compote, and Fresh Fruit...absolutely awesome.  The sausage was not listed as a side dish on the menu but I knew I had to have some with my Pancakes and they, in fact, did have Sausage Links. I had no idea what they were made of or where they came from but they were VEGAN of course and DELICIOUS. The Wife had the Chilaquiles and they were very flavorful and she simply couldn't get enough.   By the way if you check-in on YELP you get your choice of 2 types of Aqua Freshca Drinks.  We will be returning to try some ACTUAL TACOS...LOL and once we do that I will update this review...until then...Eat, Drink, and Be Merry, my Friends!!!!",

They went above and beyond to make my husband and baby feel comfortable and welcomed.   Food: it was really tasty. I went once during dinner hours and another time for brunch. The first time I ordered asada fries and a carne asada taco. My husband got one taco each from the menu. I loved my asada fries more than the taco if I'm quite honest but I had a bite of a adoba taco which I fell in love with too. I want so impressed my first time as I was during brunch. We had breakfast burritos filled with tofu black beans veggies and vegan sausage which came with a side of potatoes and fruit. The burrito was so savory and filling! We were very impressed and would def recommend to vegans and non Vegans alike!",

I ordered the Chicken Milanese, Baja and Gabacho tacos but my favorite was definitely the Gabacho. It is made with ground Beyond Beef and served in a crunchy shell.  Tacotarian also offers other dishes like burritos, enchiladas and guacamole with chips. Don't forget to check in and get your free Agua Fresca!

    "text": "Tacos are so important. Vegan tacos are even more important. I'm so delighted to see so many vegan restaurants popping up around Vegas lately. I experienced the goodness of Tacotarian for the first time today, but I can say with absolute certainty that I'll be back.  Initially, I was very pleased with the amount of drink options available. Aside from a solid selection of booze, they also have bottled drinks such as Mexican Coke and Jarritos. I ordered the Jamaica margarita and it was delightful. However, I will say that the mixologist has a very heavy hand with the tequila and I stumbled around Ikea for the hour proceeding the meal, but may be more of my issue than Tacotarian's... After a thoughtful decision, I ordered the three tacos: the Dorado, Chicken Milanesa, and Plantain con Mole tacos. Not to be dramatic, but I could've eaten many more. I would've been quite uncomfortable and overly full, but this trio was so good that I'm not insatiably curious about the other options and entrees. I've eaten many meatless meals in my day and sometimes I walk away from the table thinking it was merely \"meh\" and it was missing something, that was NOT the case here. I loved each taco more than the last.  Aside from loving the food and the atmosphere, I also loved the cashier. She was very sweet and helpful in narrowing down the menu. When I was torn between margarita options, she let me sample them. It was truly icing on the cake...errr, Daiya cheese on the vegan taco.",

Some pretty spicy    Ambiance was cool, almost coffee shop like.   Free aqua Fresca with yelp check in   The ok... Ok sums it up. The flavor of the tacos was missing a pop. The cauliflower ceviche was also ok being more on the bland side. I added some of their mild salsa just to get some flavor.   I personally like sweeter horchatas this was not.   The bad... Tacos came out cold.   Overall, I would give the place another shot to see if it was just an off night before writing it off.",

    "text": "This place has fantastic vegan Mexican food. They have a broad range of Mexican inspired flavors, from the sweet and savory Al Pastor, to mole, to the salty gabacho which looks and tastes like a Taco Bell taco. Each of their tacos has its own unique flavor and texture, and even the different tortillas they are each served on are delicious.   My favorite taco was the bean and vegan cheese taco. It was served on two soft, warm, chewy yellow corn tortillas, which went perfectly with the smooth and delicious refried pinto beans. The texture and flavor was heavenly.  The gabacho, Al Pastor, Baja, plantain con mole, and super taco were all delicious as well. The tacos are all reasonably priced and it's great that you can order single tacos to sample a wide array of flavors.   Tacotarian has done an incredible job capturing traditional Mexican flavors that are difficult for plant-based diners to find elsewhere. For example, mole sauce almost always has meat stock in it, so this place is a great chance for vegans to try traditional mole enchiladas. The food is so good that I ordered 3 extra tacos to take home and ate them right away.   They serve bottled beer and have some beer on tap. They also have a dessert menu which looks pretty good. I would recommend avoiding the Frito pie. I ordered it and found myself disappointed staring at a bowl full of Frito chips when there was so much good homemade food to be had at this restaurant instead. It was dry and I didn't notice much if any nacho cheese sauce on the Frito pie.  The staff here is friendly and accommodating. It is counter service, but the cashier and cooks try to serve you as much as possible.  Vegans and meat eaters alike should definitely try this place for a plant-based Mexican meal. Bring a huge appetite, order a ton of different taco varieties, and enjoy.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of food holidays- you know, those obnoxious, random days when social media blows up with photos of a specific dish and your email is full to bursting with discount offers all geared toward one item on one arbitrary day? Love 'em. But Meatless Monday and Taco Tuesday are weekly staples for me, and Tacotarian is a great spot to hit up on either of those days.  Tacos here are super fresh and served on corn, in a modern and inviting white and turquoise space. Menu has tacos, burritos, and other assorted Mexican dishes with proteins in the form of vegetables, Seitan, jackfruit, and even Beyond Meat products. The additional toppings on some of the tacos (just cilantro and onion vs cilantro, guac, pineapple, etc) sway my opinion to favor those that are a bit more loaded up.   I would like to try their enchiladas on a future visit but would like a choice of protein other than the current mashed potato filling. Regular prices for some tacos go up to $4 each, which is a bit steep for the small street taco-style size of the product. I do like how they partner with Nourish for their non-dairy ice cream dessert!  TIPS: Don't forget to hit up the salsa bar for some spice, both house-made and bottled options. If you go on a Tuesday, you'll be rewarded with discounts in the form of $1.99 prices on featured tacos!",

    "text": "Delicious Mexican food that happens to be vegan.   I was introduced to Tacotarian from an event where they were a vendor. During my first visit, shared the nachos and Fritos Pie with my friend. Let me just say that they're prices are amazing. This meal cost us less than $15!   Truth be told, it took me 25 minutes to get home and actually eat the food. Consequently, my nachos were a little soggy and the chips had absorbed the cheese. Not the restaurants fault, so next time I'll eat my food at the restaurant. Now, the Fritos Pie were perfect in spite of the long ride home. For $5.99, you cannot find a better deal. Honesty, the portion size is large enough for two people to share.   The restaurant itself is super-cute and very clean. The staff were very sweet and personable. Looking forward to my next visit, where I'll actually order some tacos!",

    "text": "Let's start out by saying, I'm not a Vegan. My friends are and they wanted me to check out this place simply because I love tacos. I'm always game to try new foods, regardless of what it is.   Upon arriving the place is full of light and sunshine. Very welcoming, however the staff that I interacted w/ seemed to be just going through the motions. I tend to say 'hi, how are you?', generally I get a response of 'blah blah, how are you?'. In this interaction the cashier's response was 'how can I help you?' This same scenario happened to my friend. However another person that came up after us, the cashier had an actual conversation w/ the customer. Odd.   I ordered: Carne Asada (Gucamole & pico) Dorado (deep fried mashed potato, cheddar, lettuce, pico and crema)  Baja (Fried beer-battered avocado, cilantro-lime slaw, guac, pico, salsa Morita)  I had to get the Carne Asada to try it. Not sure why they would name it this, if it's a Vegan place. Especially since as I grew up w/ carne asada, I know it as beef. This was the best taco out of those I ordered. Such good flavor. I chose the Dorado mainly to try some deep fried mashed potato. I just wasn't feeling the flavor of this taco. Baja sounded so good, but much like the Dorado, the flavors did mesh for my taste buds.   I was surprised on the turn around time to get my food. It took about 10 minutes. I didn't mind as I was w/ friends and thankfully I wasn't starving, but that's longer than I've had to wait for food at a non vegan taco place.   I will say that they do offer a large selection and variety of food. My friend lives for this place.",

One of my go to lunch places and so far it hasn't disappointed. They offer a good variety of taco choices as well. Most people come because of the Vegan option, to be honest, I didn't even know it was vegan cause the food tasted amazing.   My friend and I also really enjoyed their Watermelon Fresca. It was cool and refreshing that complemented the heat from the hot sauce I had with my burrito. Highly recommend to those that have not tried!",

Not to mention they serve awesome margaritas. The dessert was soo worth it even though I was stuffed! We ordered the fried Oreos and churro ice cream.  Great place to bring the family!

The saving grace for this place was the Cali burrito. I tried it tonight and was BLOWN AWAY. I will come back specifically for this in the future. The combination and ratio of ingredients was perfect and I don't like regular nacho cheese but the house made stuff they put in there is really unique and tasty. Guess the 4th time was the charm.",

Ordering was actually easy because our cashier was super knowledgeable about the menu and her product. She made helpful suggestions which lead us to the perfect tacos. Damage was about 25$ with a tip at the register. I'm used to extortion as a vegan and I didn't think the pricing was too high, could be too soon to know for sure though. But we had, soup, 4 tacos, chips and salsa and a sprite for like 22$ so that's not horrible. And we were pretty full in the end. Grabbed a table for two in the corner. It wasn't super busy when we got there at about 5 but I'm sure that will change when people catch on. There is a good amount is seating options also. A high top down the middle with stills and tables around the sides. The place was clean and well thought out as far as branding and decor. There is eve some swag if you're into it. On to the food... only reason for the 4 Star and not a 5 is because something happened in back and the second half of our order came out 40m later. We started with some fideo soup which was awesome. And some salsa and chips which was also grubbin'. But where were those tacos... after they figured out they missed our food it came out in a reasonable time. Well made and delicious. Presentation was great. I always appreciate when my food is put together well. Each taco we tried was really good. Tried 4 different styles and they were all individually good and I didn't find similarities in the ingredients at all. They did a great job there. For sure stop by when you can. Vegan or not you're going to enjoy. I'll defiantly be back soon to explore more of the menu options. There are a bunch. This is more than a taco shop. #grub",

    "text": "Ok so I wanted to come here a few times before writing my review. I have been three times now and plan to continue supporting this great spot! Being in the restaurant biz myself, I know that that first month or so is a time where you grow and learn and improve, so I have NO doubt in my mind, any \"kinks\" here will be worked out.  First, Service wise, this is a spot that you can tell, the employees are happy to be working at. This says a lot for the management and owners too. Everyone I've encountered is friendly and knowledgeable and has welcomed me back. They come out and check on you and when the ordering line has been \"long\" other staff has come out on handheld pos systems and taken orders.  Second, Decor is great! Simple and clean and fun. White with black and teal. Little plants on the tables and just an overall fresh feeling spot.  Third, and most importantly, Food. I have had a good majority of the tacos, a couple starters/sides, one entree and one dessert.  Since I've had so much there, at this stage I'm having a hard time remembering what all I had on what day. But.... for the most part, everything has been great! Some of the tacos are smaller then others but I don't think any are overpriced or disappointing. With prices under $3 on almost every single taco, I don't understand how some people have complained that they are overpriced??? Most tacos are 2.50. What do people expect? This is a business that uses quality ingredients and doesn't pay their employees \"sweatshop\" wages. How on earth could they charge less for food that has homemade sauces and house pickled items and whatnot. People are crazy if they think 2.50 is overpriced for a good taco. Seriously, stay home or continue eating fast foods $1 menu, if that's your mentality.  Items I've had: Gabacho taco Barbacoa taco Dorado taco Baja taco Chicharron verde taco Plantains con Mole taco Takis Elote Asada Fries Flautas Guacamole Churros   My least favorite thing was the guacamole. I just was left wanting some that was reminiscent of some I know they make elsewhere... My favorites: churros for sure!!!! Also the asada fries are filling and very satisfying. Almost too \"meaty\" in a way, but great for the non vegans for sure! Flautas were great and something I never order at Mexican restaurants but these were fun and filling! Came with rice and beans and pico and guacamole. Taco wise, I loved the Gabacho. Yes it is that standard taco that makes you think of having taco nite back in the day with the fam. Hard shell with the lettuce cheese and meat. The Plantain was flavorful and fun. And the chicharron was surprisingly good! I have NEVER liked chicharron before (when I ate meat) so wasn't sure how I'd like this, but it was great!  I wish the takis elote had more cilantro. But I will admit I am a cilantro fiend so....  They now have their alcohol license so beers will make dinner (or lunch) complete!  I definitely recommend checking this place out, whether you eat meat or not. I also think the owners for opening on the south west, so that all of us do not have to drive to the Eastside for vegan tacos anymore!!!!",

If you haven't been here yet you are MISSING OUT - first of all I want to say that after a long day of getting beat up at work, finishing my day with a visit to tacotarian is HEAVEN. With that out of the way, I want to say every taco here is amazing but my favorite is the GABACHO - classic loaded crunchy taco! You can't go wrong!!!   You cannot forget an Asada fries either! They're an essential part of my trip here. Everything is so good though!! That definitely makes things a bit more difficult so you'll need multiple trips back throughout the week. Don't worry, you'll be just like the rest of us who are now ADDICTED to this place and I drive here aaaaallll the way from summerlin!   Last, but not least - DESSERT - you cannot leave without the coconut cake- it's quintessential- it's all creamy and rich but milky like a Tres leches and there's caramel.... oooh the caramel, get a scoop of vanilla ice cream if they have and ask for extra caramel- you'll thank me later.   See you next time TACOTARIAN-",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here to try the Cali burrito with jackfruit. I was expecting something similar to seriously flavorful  pulled pork but when I bit into the burrito, there were large chunks of jackfruit  that didn't taste anything like the \"meat\" it's pretending to be. I was disappointed for sure, the chunks were very off-putting. Also, the inside of the burrito was so runny, it was like soupy mush (baby food texture). There was no density to it, when I bit the left side,  the ingredients on the right side spilled out, I bit the right and the left side spilled out. It was an unpleasant mess that I just couldn't finish. 1/5  Asada fries - this was a last minute addition to the order and boy am I glad we did. I'll come back over and over just for this alone. Perfectly crunchy fries, meat flavor was amazing, just great! 5/5  Mushroom tacos were okay, not bad, not great... There wasn't much flavor, I probably won't try them again. 3/5  Horchata was good and refreshing, margarita was tasty but I couldn't tell there was alcohol. The place is super cute and hip, reminds me of LA. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu and to get more asada fries.",

Del Taco has Beyond Meat, and I've thoroughly enjoyed a hearty Beyond Meat burrito from them.   The soft shell jackfruit taco was probably the one that shined the most.

The staff at this establishment is phenomenal, especially Laura who is always kind and quick to address any questions we may have regarding the menu items. Currently I'm addicted to their agua frescas, soy chorizo taco, and cauliflower ceviche. Try them all and I promise you won't be disappointed!",

The decor is super cute and the music is bangin!   First off the prices are fantastic! Taco Tuesdays has even better deals. We ordered carne asada, pastor, and plantain tacos. We also ordered Takis Elote and fried Oreos. All I can say is the food was delicious, the staff was amazing, and overall we enjoyed our first experience.   We have no complaints. Hubby said this is going to be our taco Tuesday spot lol. Oh and they serve beer and margaritas, which is another reason why hubby likes this place. I think me and the ladies might try out the Sunday brunch soon so stay tuned for that review.",

    "text": "Currently my favorite Vegan restaurant in Vegas! I've told everyone about this restaurant and how great their tacos are. I've mainly tried the vegetarian ones with vegetables  (not the ones with the fake meat because I don't eat gluten). The baja, bean and cheese, jamaica, plantain, veggie, dorado, and mushroom. They are all outstanding! I love their enchiladas, rice, and beans too. All seasoned perfectly. I wish the enchiladas had more veggies instead of mashed potatoes though so it's less on the carbs. The baja taco makes you think you're eating a fish taco! Outstanding jamaica margarita!  Service is always friendly and good here.   The minus one star was for the burrito which completely fell apart at first bite and inside was like soup. I've had great vegetarian burritos with lots of veggies but this burrito doesn't hit the mark.",

But I ended up ordering an enchilada plate as my first time try because I really wanted the sides of rice and beans. And my boyfriend ordered the cali burrito. We both each decided to try one taco as well. I got the Baja and he got the gabacho! The gabacho taco was so so so good! The meat is absolutely the best!  The Baja was light zesty and refreshing.  My enchilada was so filling I definitely couldn't finish it but my tummy is so happy! Lol   I like spicy and tried their sauces they had next to the water station, but the one on the table is the best!   Happy hour starts at 3 so we just missed it but it tacos and drinks which is cool!  Service is really friendly! And the restaurant itself is just so cute! All the decorations are eye catching!   Can't wait to go back! My new fav spot!",

Sometimes when I go to vegan spots, I get really put off by the cheese or sometimes the \"meat\" substitutes have a weird taste to me. This is definitely not what happened here. My boyfriend got the California burrito. Honestly, we couldn't even tell there wasn't real meat in there. I loved the \"carne Asada\" fries.   The horchata was also super refreshing.   The staff was very friendly and it's def a cool place to sit down and have a meal. I loved this place way more than some other vegan spots I've tried.",

We came in on a Saturday night and although it wasn't a super huge space, it was pretty packed! Luckily, we found a corner spot where we could fit our stroller.   My husband saved our seats while I decided to order practically everything on the menu! The lady at the register was super helpful with giving me some ideas on what to try and what's popular.   Not only is everything super affordable, but there's a lot of diversity on the menu! From the beer battered avacado tacos, (my favorite because that crunch and sauce on top is bomb) to the jackfruit and beyond meat options, they have something for everyone!  Everything came out super fast, fresh, and warm, and we appreciated the complimentary and flavorful cucumber water. We finished our meal with the delicious, cinnamon churros, which were served with a type of caramel sauce.  I believe we ordered about 8 tacos and that was plenty for the two of us! I really should have stopped at three...but I really wanted to try more!  Our bill was less than a typical night out and yet we were super full and satisfied! The best part of all was knowing there were no animals harmed in the making of our food! We'll definitely be back!",

Every single item was prepared in a way that I thought I was having real meat and cheese.

Today I tried the sopa, and then the dorado and Baja taco. Yes to all!   The sopa was tasty. Had a little secret chili kick after a few sips. Fresh little bits of cilantro but not overpowering. It was my perfect starter.   Dorado was interesting. I thought \"mashed potato?!\" And as expected it's straight up a mashed potato crunchy taco but somehow it works haha   Baja was flavorful and fresh tasting. It's funny cause it's a guac on avocado taco but you know what?? ..As a lover of avocado everything...yes.   Hubby had the Cali burrito with chicken. He said he liked that it was fresh tasting. He used words like Tex mex feeling but strong natural flavors. He mentioned he didn't feel stuffed which is great cause we wanted something on the lighter feeling side.",

Six members of our extended family, including a vegetarian, a couple pescatarians, and a few typical eaters came in recently...and in the end, we were all very satisfied with our meal.  In addition to one of the best names around, Tacotarian is a vegan taco spot with a trendy interior and some of the best vegan tacos around. If tacos aren't really your thing, brunch is always a popular choice for regulars, offering a wider variety of options. Outside of brunch, the menu consists of an abundance of tacos, as well as several related options, such as burritos, nachos, quesadillas, and the like. Some refreshing agua frescas and complementary infused water are perfect for everyone, but those enticed by a cervesas pairing will be pleased as well.  After trying most of the tacos on the menu, I've zeroed in on my favorites: Super, Pastor, Baja, and Veggie.  Admittedly, carnivores may not enjoy Tacotarian as much as their favorite taco spot, but in our group at least, no one felt like they were settling for inferior food either.",

As far as the food goes the tacos were lacking in flavor, pretty much tasted exactly the same and the tortilla shells were stale. The rice and beans had nice flavor but were luke warm. If you're looking for a great vegan alternative to Mexican food, this isn't it....it has no authentic Mexican flavor to it at all. Vegan Mexican food CAN taste authentic but you need to know how to season and use fresh herbs and veggies. Everything was just super bland and it didn't feel like there was any love put into the food....I'm not inspired to return.",

Although they forgot about our last order and we had to remind them.. the young man handled it right away after informing him we didn't receive it. So it was no biggie! But just an FYI for the management: one of your employees, the shorter Latin chick with the French braids had 0 customer service at all, a resting bitch face, with no emotion, very unwelcoming & bad energy! This place had a good-vibe ambience and she just killed it. Definitely should have someone in the front who is more down to earth and people friendly. Other than that, I'd come back again!",

I love the variety of options and that they are plant-based. There is no shortage on flavor here and you won't miss the meat. The decor is inviting and simplistic, and seating is a bit limited. I've been twice around 9 pm and the wait was about 15-20 min. The staff is friendly and informative. I was gonna mention parking but I remembered this isn't LA! Lol. Enjoy your tacos!!!!",

My favorite is the Super Taco - which, if you're a carnivore, you definitely won't be able to tell that this is vegan.  The flavor is so on point, sometimes this is the only taco I order.  When I'm trying to eat healthier I reach for the Barbacoa (jackfruit) or the Mushroom Asada.    I haven't tried their Sunday Brunch yet but I hope to soon!   I'm so glad it's close by where we live - I hope they continue to do well because having vegan tacos in my life raises the quality of my life for realz :)",

I ordered the flautas, a tea, and a concha.  The flautas lacked overall flavor and the tortillas tasted like a stale store bought tortilla.  The tea was delicious but the kind I ordered escapes my memory.  The concha. SO BAD. It was really stale, like my 13 month had a hard time eating the pieces I tore off stale. It lacked any flavor or sweetness. And the blue color dye they use on them is awful, stained our teeth. You would think that a plant based restaurant would use natural food coloring methods.   I also had a bite of an al pastor taco, flavor was alright, nothing to write home over. I also had a bite of the takis elote and the flavor was really funky, not a fan at all, they cooked the corn off or something. I couldn't quite put my finger on why it was so odd.  Overall I was really disappointed. Everything lacked flavor and more importantly everything lacked Mexican flavor. Which is puzzling, everyone that worked there was clearly Hispanic, they all spoke Spanish to each other so I have no idea how the flavors were so off.  Not worth the 30 miles round trip to get there. There are plenty of other Mexican vegan joints that do it right.",

But when the food came out I was a little let down. The protein in my tacos was so burnt and they were incredibly small for the price you pay. I also really wish the tacos came with a lime and salsa to the side. The nachos were so barren I had mostly tortilla chips with very little toppings, it was also very small for $10. I'll definitely never order the nachos again if they stay that small and toppingless. I'll try some tacos again and see if they can do better, but I might still have to make the drive to Pancho's. I do not mean any of this in a harsh way, just hope to be heard so the business can grow and flourish. I will up my stars the next time I visit if it goes better. I truly hope it does so I don't have to drive so far.",

If no one told you that nothing here had meat or dairy you'd easily not notice the difference. I got a churro for dessert.

Walked in, greeted with the cool hip decor and a bunch of Tacotarians. As soon as I saw the menu I immediately contemplating spending my entire check on everything. We ordered 4 different tacos, chips and salsa, and elotes. I dived right into the carne asada taco, ARE YOU KIDDNG ME! I looked my fiance in the eyes and life was complete. Her beautiful smile and a vegan carne asada taco in my mouth. I didn't stop there, I finished every taco in front of me. Service was great, as I finished one they came and cleaned up the mess. I felt like I was on Henry Ford's general assemble line full of tacos. Once I caught my breathe I texted my family and friends and recommended they come here ASAP. Don't you dare think I didn't want more, I went back in line and ordered more! At this point my fiance thought I was disgusting with how much I had put in my belly in this 15 minute sitting. But with a smile from ear to ear she didn't mind to much. Don't think I ended with tacos, I also ordered the churros. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! These made the churros at Disneyland look like the adventure dome at circus circus. Thank Tacotarian for the experience and I will be back! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! Let's goooo!!",

I'm still in the restaurant drinking my Jamaica, there are old movies projecting on the wall in front of me, I am full and I am happy.  The decor of this place is beautiful. If you told me this was their first business I would be INCREDIBLY shocked. No detail was left unthought of and the place is themed meticulously. Once again, this place is beautiful.  I ordered the Mushroom Asada, the Al Pastor, and the Dorado taco.  The Al Pastor was seasoned wonderfully, the texture was perfect, the sauce was just enough sauce and if you gave this to me and didn't tell me it was vegan, I'd believe you. Some vegans might be weirded out about the texture or the meatiness of the taco, this is your warning, all of the meats are incredibly believable.  The mushroom asada was good, not great, but that's because it felt familiar to me, a meat eater. This was a classic taco and it did the job. I'd order again.  The dorado taco was hands down my favorite. I have a soft spot for mashed potato tacos, I used to eat them in Denver and they've always been a favorite for me. The salsa on this taco was amazing. Everything about this taco was perfect and I will be ordering this taco every time I come, even if I don't think I want it, I need it.   I love the trend of vegan taco places opening up and I want to eat at all of them, however this will be my go to because it's so close to my house and the all around experience was near perfect",

They have so many tacos I love coming back and trying new things.  the plantain con mole is the most unique and one of my favs! I've also tried the Asada Fries which Are loaded with carne asada, nacho cheese guac , pico and sour cream. Even though they are fully loaded the fries Are thick and crispy and they don't get soggy like some other places in town. My all time fav though has to be the Cali burrito! It's huuuuge and you can pick whatever \"meat\" you want. I always get it with the pastor meat bc i love pineapple.   Overall i think the portions are fantastic for the price. I see other people reviewed that the tacos are small but if you go to Mexico these are what street tacos look like. I'm willing to pay a little more for good quality ingredients. But i feel these prices are reasonable.   The burritos come with rice and beans which i can never finish. I would say get a burrito to split and then order a bunch of tacos so you can try more of the menu.   The decor is super cute with old black and white Mexican movies playing on the wall. The music and vibe are 5 star as well.   The staff is so friendly and accommodating. When i ask for suggestions they genuinely seem excited to give me their recommendations. Everyone seems happy to be there.   I look forward to coming back often because i live in the neighborhood and now they have margaritas which i can't wait to try!",

We ordered:   Mushroom Asada - small ass taco with just asada seasoned baby mushrooms on top....  Dorado - Ok however the flavor was really bland...should have added some type of sauce to this...  Al Pastor - I personally thought like it tasted like Al Pastor however some people didn't..really good as an \"alternative\" but some vegans may not want that meat flavor...  Plantain con Mole - Personally not a fan of mole however we agreed that this was the most impressive taco that we had...should have ordered the Baja....  Takis Elote - Good as elotes can be  Concha Loca - Really good..light and sweet but not sweet to the point where you feel guilty of eating it  Tacotarian is good and if Yelp allowed .5 star increments, this would be a 3.5/5....I am glad they are pushing a different idea or concept of Mexican cuisine however the prices, the size of the tacos, and the bar that Gracias Madre set for me mentally when it comes to Plant-Based Mexican Cuisine makes it tough to fully recommend it.",

    "text": "Amazing taco selection, everything is 100% vegan and plant based. I honestly can't wait to go back and try more!! I went and sampled several different tacos the last time I was there and still didn't even make a dent in the menu choices. Their beer on tap, which is vegan certified, is also a great pairing with some yummy tacos.   Customer service is A+ and all of the staff is nice, courteous and knows their menu!  Definitely recommend for anyone who loves tacos even if you're not vegan! You won't miss the meat AND your money isn't going towards the exploitation of wonderful sentient creatures like cows, or pigs or chickens!",

Sadly the horchata is a little watery, and it's only 1 size which Is like a 12oz I think but even so the food is good stuff. 100% vegan, I highly recommend the Chicken Milanesa.",

It's very filling, and as someone that eats a lot of meat, I can say you're not gonna tell that it's a veggie burrito. Plus the side of rice and beans along with their sauces just makes the whole meal. It's a very comfortable atmosphere that's very chill. This is for sure a new go to spot!",

I ordered the Jamaica taco and it was good, yet I would not order it again. My friend ordered the al pastor taco and it too was just ok and she would not order it again. We ordered the carne asada fries: mediocre at best.  The Jamaica margaritas were outstanding.  The service is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. We went to check it out because of the high ratings. I love vegan food, but I am not sold on this place. It was okay, not memorable. I asked myself if I would come back here again and the answer is not likely as just okay.",

They have many taco options for us. I went with the mushroom asada and the dorado. They both had flavor and the dorado was fried perfectly. Food was so good we decided to order the asada fries to go. To top it off they have churros to complete your meal. Margaritas were satisfying, we had the traditional and Jamaica. Service was outstanding!! Love a place where the employees enjoy their job and actually look happy helping guests. We'll definitely make it a point to visit on our next trip to Vegas. Thank you",

They have unique combinations-I tried the chicken Milanese, Baja, and the veggie tacos. I can't say I'm a fan of mashed potatoes in my tacos. My sister had the Cali burrito which was good but I just feel like the flavors they combine clash and don't necessary fit together well. The place is little but the music is loud. I like it but wouldn't say I love it. The horchata which is free with yelp check in was good, not so sweet like other ones I've had but you could taste all the powder at the bottom.",

The prices, the service, the menu, the decor, the location... it's all five star.  I've eaten some questionable vegan cuisine across central and southern Mexico and this place is superior, really-there is NO comparison. I was humored to experience some first time vegan eaters during my visit. If you have any skeptical carnivores in your party or simply just want a one stop shop to feed everyone in your family, this is the joint for you.  Tons of \"meat\"-like proteins, as well as plant based options. I have sworn off meat outside of seafood and tend to not enjoy meat like textures. With that being said, we ordered 7 different types and really enjoyed them all.  I will often find myself saturating Mexican food in salsa to give it more flavor. All of these tacos can stand alone, all killer good. I found myself swaying more so on the plant based side and and am looking forward to come back and have them again.  I 100% recommend the Taco de Jamaica and the Baja. Just these two tacos alone will keep me coming back for years to come.  Tip- get the chips and salsa because the large side of salsa verde is killer and appears to be different than the salsa that is available on the bar.  This place is far too cool for it's own good and if it ever leaves, I will follow.",

Worst churros ever, they were super oily from outside and inside (maybe the heat of the oil wasn't there), the shape was totally off, the inside was dry, and the needed more cinnamon.

I've tried every taco on their list at least twice and I can't pick a favorite! Showcasing classics in a vegan flare: mushroom asada, al pastor, and chorizo, which will leave omnivores scratching their heads, but where Tacotarian really shines is in their clever and creative tacos: Taco de Jamaica (hibiscus that's savory, what?), Plantain con Mole (sweet and savory), Baja Taco (beer-battered and deep fried avocado; beam me up, Scotty).  Tacotarian is a fast-casual cafe with limited seating and its on a first come, first served basis. Not recommend for large parties. On Sundays they have brunch and extend their dining area to the parking lot with perfect patio-ish vibes.  Be sure to ask what their specials are. My last visit I scored cauliflower ceviche. Its tender, citrus-y, and came with beautiful, creamy avocado. Delectable. Their insanely delicious Chicken Milense taco was made into a torta. There are plates of enchiladas, quesadillas, and flautas! Tasty re-imagined sides Takis Elote (street corn re-imagined and muy delicioso!) and takin' it back to junior high lunch with Frito pie.  They offer a slew of Agua Frescas (my fave) with flavors changing daily, Mexican Cokes (yay sugar), beers, and margaritas!   Tacotarian has something for everyone! Delicious, quick, casual, and inspired. One of my all-time favorite joints. Be careful, this place is budget-friendly, innovative and extremely addictive!

The tacos are street taco size so you can eat a few; they do really well in the flavors of each taco, i haven't been disappointed. I'm a huge fan of the Cali burrito with extra fries - it comes with a small salad (dressing is excellent), beans and rice. It's a massive burrito. The fries here are super yummy. The choco taco is a nice change of pace from the majority of vegan ice cream desserts. Most recently I tried the quesadilla and my boyfriends comment was \"are you sure this isn't real cheese?\" Honestly you can't go wrong in whatever you choose here.  The service is decent, it depends on how busy the restaurant is. Staff isn't overly friendly but not rude either - they get the job done. You order at the counter, receive a number then grab a table.  It's a small space with adorable decor, it gets crowded quickly but clears out fairly quickly too.  Happy hour, Taco Tuesday's and Wednesday's are great times to visit here. Vegan tacos for life now! Thanks Tacotarian!",

On Sundays they bring Ronald's Vegan donuts, which save you a drive to Chinatown if your looking the best Vegan donuts on the planet!   The owner is a stand up guy and works his ass off. We are going to see this company grow in the next five years! I wouldn't be surprised if seen more of these around the valley and then spread to other states. The concept, the menu, the branding at are flawless. I would honestly like to be the one who helps them turn this into the next biggest thing for fast food!  Healthy fast food, and it's amazing!! Game over!!! $$$$$",

    "text": "I'd prefer to give it 2.5 stars. Without that option, normally I'd grade-up to 3 stars, but after a lot of thought, I just can't do that in this case.  I'd been anxious to try Tactotarian since first hearing about it long before they opened.  Finally made the drive on a recent Thursday, arriving around 5PM.  Parking was easy, there were a couple customers inside but no wait at the order counter.  I ordered a Barbacoa & a Mushroom taco, a side of chips & guacamole, & a horchata to drink.   Bill total was $15-something -- relatively expensive, so I sure hoped the food was worth it, especially since it was going to be a 24 mile round-trip drive just to try this place.  Guacamole & chips plus the horchata were delivered to my table quickly.  I was immediately disappointed to see how small the cup of Horchata was, based on the price, plus the serving size that I've gotten at all other places that serve it for a similar prices (& some places --not Tacotarian-- are self-serve/free refills). And of course about 40% of the volume of the cup was occupied by ice.  The flavor of Tacotarian's horchata was different than what I'm accustomed to.  Perhaps the Horchata that I've had at dozens of places in Mexico & the USA isn't vegan, & the Horchata at Tacotarian is, but to me, it just didn't taste great.  The guacamole & chips were good -- meaning the chips & guacamole tasted fresh, the guacamole was cool & with a normal bit of seasoning.  A few minutes later, less than 10 minutes after placing my order, the two tacos arrived. Costing about $3 apiece & having no meat in them, you'd expect them to be good-sized.  But any decent Mexican joint or reasonable person would refer to the size Tacotarian served me as mini-Tacos -- about 3 normal, hungry adult bites, & it's gone.  While I'm not vegan, I am a longtime vegetarian as well as longtime consumer of vegetarian & occasionally vegan Mexican food, so my frustration over an abject lack of any Mexican flavor is not actually an adjustment to no meat or chicken flavor or texture in the food, it truly means that there was little to no Mexican flavor, & little flavor at all, until I doused them in the salsa verde that thankfully came with the chips & guacamole.  Part of me would love to come back sometime & try some of their other menu items, but I suspect that's more out of curiosity (Do they have ANY tacos that have decent flavor?), and it's reasonable that if I tried two different types, I'll likely be disappointed by the others.  Even if I did like them, $15 & some change for two *mini-tacos*, some chips & guacamole & a very small, almost flavorless drink is targeting the affluent vegan hipsters from nearby Summerlin, not me.   I'll be very happy to get better tasting food & more of it at Taco y Taco or Chipotle.  Based on my experience, Tacotarian provides OK but overpriced vegan food.  It does not provide good vegan Mexican food nor a good value for your money.",

Another person in my group got the crunchy tacos, and the taco shells were some straight up \"why not both\" Old El Paso taco making kit shells. Will prolly stick with panchos for my vegan mex fix.",

    "text": "Not bad. Props for being entirely plant-based.   Been here two days in a row. Wanted to sample a bunch of things before I wrote a review.   No Carne Asada - the soy meat they use has a really odd peppery taste. I've had vegan jerky in the past that has a similar taste. It is not pleasant. It tastes plasticy.   Gabacho - a taco your mom would make. Nothing crazy, but super good. Think a standard Taco Bell taco, but vegan style. The Beyond Meat crumbles on this are amazing.   Barbacoa - I'm not a huge fan of jack fruit, and this didn't change my mind. I do think that jack fruit has a super mild flavor of it's own, and I think this taco didn't do enough to cover up that slightly sour taste and musty taste.   Chorizo - DO IT. DO IT TWICE. Go crazy with this one. It's worth it.   Dorado - Mash potatoes? I'm listening. But on a taco, maybe not. Didn't care for it. The taco shell on this one was slightly fried but soggy? It's supposed to be deep fried. Disclaimer: I did order to go, so possible it was sitting there long than intended.   Staff is very friendly and welcoming. On Tuesdays their tacos are 1.99, so come for that. The value is amazing. Other vegan taco shops in town don't do anything for Taco Tuesday and overall are more expensive. I will continue to eat my way through the menu and report back with my findings.",

So glad she wanted to try this out, so now I know next time I go beyond my side of town to stop by here. They made me feel like they sincerely cared... The gentleman behind the counter was so pleasant and considerate and COMPASSIONATE. The lady that brought my to go food out was like sunshine, a warm smile and kind demeanor.  Highly recommend this spot because the food is AMAZING, but the people there are top notch...   Also, the decor is cute and clean.  Love you all, sending you all peace and love and high fives.",

I've always called in my orders, food is very inconsistent, sometimes the Asada is amazing, sometimes the pastor, sometimes the potato one. Reason I'm really torn is my food kind of tasted like dog food. \" no I don't know the taste of dog food\" but if I did I'd imagine it tasted like what was served to me last time.   Asada fries are delicious, fried Oreos and I'm unsure of the potato taco thats always on point.   I'll keep visiting, hope it gets more consistent and side note it would be nice if the employees appreciated when they're tipped instead of expected tips.",

You can't even tell they do not have meat or any kind of meat products. As a fellow person from California and as a Mexican-American, I have a profound love for tacos but NONE in California have come close to these VEGAN tacos. I am beyond impressed and can't wait to share my delectable dining experience with friends back home in Northern California. Also- I only write YELP reviews when the restaurants I eat at (and there are a ton) are 5-Star quality in service, taste and personality. This place has it all! Did I mention the owners are absolutely amazing people? They too deserve 5 stars for hospitality, friendliness and professionalism! Will always come back to this place!!!
