But the crazy milkshakes takes the cake- literally! My boy had the Brooklyn blackout and my other boy had the cake shake. OMG!! Yes, the shakes are a bit steep in price ($15-17) but the look on you're child's face when they bring the shake to your table is priceless. And the taste? DELICIOUS.",

I ordered the Bam Bam shake - fruity pebbles shake covered in whipped cream and fruity pebbles, vanilla frosted rim with more fruity pebbles, a strawberry laffy taffy rope, half a strawberry Poptart, rice Krispy treat and cherry on top. Burger was really good but fries were average at best. Honestly, the best BEST part of dining at this location is the staff. It was a super busy night but we got seated at the bar almost right away. The servers behind the bar were absolutely amazing and so attentive. The atmosphere and vibe were also super fun, and it was a blast to see all the different crazy shakes come out and everyone's expressions when they saw their sweet treat!",

From the crazy shakes to delicious burgers and  endless instagram back drops to take pictures. I had The Greg Norman burger which includes wagyu beef, house butter milk dill, blue cheese and arugula. All burger patties are cooked to a chef medium so they are still nice and pink. Fries were golden and crispy. The fried pickles  were an app that will have me coming back! But the star of the show was definitely the crazy shakes! You can even go up to the bar and watch as they create your sugar filled treat! The Cookies 'n Cream Supreme was accompanied with a whole ice cream sandwich! The Brooklyn Blackout was accompanied with a whole chocolate brownie and The Cookie Shake included two cookiewiches!   I cannot wait to recommend this place to friends and family. Keep up the amazing quality!",

It wasn't a busy night, but it took forever for us to get an order in.  We ordered burgers and asked for medium rare.  At some points, it WAS medium rare.  But at other points, it was all sorts of styles.  It was like the Earth(I do mean the planet).  The outside was well-done, but at its core, it was rare as all hell. It was not worth the 20$  My girlfriend loved the blue cheese on mine, but after awhile, I got tired of it.  The milkshakes are ALL hype.  Honestly, the strawberry shake tasted like something from in-n-out. I wish it was made with actually cotton candy ice cream. To be a real cotton candy milkshake. It was a strawberry milkshake topped with some cotton candy.  And at one point, it felt like we weren't going to be able to order a milkshake. Our waiter told us the machine broke.  The only 'wow' factor of it was the outside part.",

What I expected was the pickled peppers you get at the burrito shop, but these are done in house and go very well with the cilantro garnish.   Additional appeal for having a GREAT playlist going and decor/ambiance is top notch and far out hip.   At first glance you won't notice the patio (very chill) with shuffleboard and view (but not too close) of the strip, but that's an option.

The menu is huge - be prepared to make some decisions. There are six different specialty shakes. We got the Cookie Shake - it was HUGE but delicious. The frosting flavors mingle nicely with the chocolate chip cookie and handspun ice cream flavors. Don't be overwhelmed when you see it - it's worth it.   We ordered the Greg Norman and the Crispy Chicken. The crispy chicken was the highlight of the meal (after the shake). It's soft and juicy yet crispy. The salad/pickle on top is fresh and crunchy. And the sauce is impeccable. We were not impressed with the Greg Norman despite the wagu - it was over cooked and charred.   Definitely will be back on our next trip!",

They're definitely big but what I noticed was the brownie in mine was very large which you have to eat first as it is on the top but then maybe 40% of the cup was whip cream. It took me a while to get to the ice cream part. I got the Brooklyn Blackout, I believe it was called. They're fun, a great IG pic lol, and something neat to show family or friends visiting Vegas but aside from that, I wouldn't run down to have one. I feel you'd get more ice cream from a DQ Blizzard.  I also got the Mexico City burger and regular fries. Fries are thick, burger is gourmet standard but nothing I'd sprint down for again.   Service was good, decorations are cool. No complaints at all, just nothing I would visit a second time.  Oh and if you're a light eater, don't order food before the milkshake lol or SHARE it!

I can't say the last time I have a burger that good! It's actually worth the price.  I had the old fashioned and it was damn good.   The shakes are over the top. I skipped trying a beer or cocktail and opted for a shake. The peanut butter one. It was fully loaded (as in my picture) with pretzel sticks, candy, frosting, etc. A fantastic shake but it was more loaded with whipped cream and candy that there was actually very little shake to it. Just as much whipped cream as there is actual shake drink.  Price vs item it wasn't worth it, UNLESS you are going specifically for dessert. If I just wanted a dessert and not a shake, then go for it. It's hand crafted and tastes like it.   Our server was fantastic and fun. The staff was attentive and helping each other fill water (if you have a shake with dinner, you'll drink a lot of water. lol) and clear empty plates.   Had the deep fried dill pickle slices as well..good stuff! The dill dressing on the side for dipping was pretty amazing as well.   The back patio will be the place to be, since it over looks the gondola's and you have a clear view of the volcano erupting across the street!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here to give this place a try. We had a party of 6 and was about a 25 min wait on a Saturday evening (9:30pm). I ordered the Californian burger ($17) and a passionfruit lemonade ($5). If you aren't a big truffle fan, I would opt for the truffle mayo to be on the side. It's very strong!! My turkey patty was a little on the dry side, but with the guac tomato lettuce it was bearable.  I mixed in some chipotle mayo with my truffle mayo together and it tasted great! Like my friend had mentioned the fries were perfectly seasoned, our table was not given any ketchup, and forks were not replenished at our table.  Water was served luke warm, eww! I ordered a passionfruit lemonade to try instead of a shake which I regret now. I'd much rather spend an extra $4 on a classic shake or the extra $10 on the crazy shake due to the portion you get. My lemonade was mediocre and there was no refills available on it. The size of the lemonade was probably about an 8 oz size at most, only slightly larger than the mason jars for water. My boyfriend had ordered the Mexico City burger and felt it was a disappointment as it was lacking the Mexico City flavor... i.e. he felt that it should have included guac. Feel free to had a small spoonful of guac for $2. That's how much my Californian came with.   Our server was missing during most of our meal as well and for the price of the burgers, I expected more that's why I would rate this place at 3.5 stars.    The decor is pretty hip here, if I were to come back I'd like to try their drinks and shakes. A good place to have a quick bite and catch up with friends.",

    "text": "If you are wanting over-the-top dessert that takes you back to your childhood this would be the place to get it. We decided not to have both lunch and dessert as the prices are a little high. If you want to do both I suggest you share your shake. Burgers are between $15-22 and shakes are anywhere between $15-17.   You're probably going to make a mess eating these. They are stacked and in order to get your spoon out you'll shift some ice cream and toppings around. I didn't bother with my straw, just used the spoon.   I ordered the cookies and cream milkshake which had an ice cream sandwich on top and Oreos \"glued\" to the outside rim of the cup with I think frosting. It was yummy and not too sweet.   My husband got the cake batter shake which had a slice of vanilla sprinkle cake on top and sprinkles glued around the outside rim. His was very sweet and the ice cream tasted exactly like dipping your finger into a bowl of vanilla cake batter, had a tangy flavor to it.   Overall good experience just expensive for two shakes. The lighting is not very good very dim. You can enjoy your food outside as well it was just too hot for us.",

    "text": "Yesterday my friends and I wanted to stop by this place since we heard great things! We stayed in Vegas for my 21st (it was on Saturday!) and before leaving today we wanted black tap for my last dinner.  My friend and I split a Texan burger, which was okay, not that flavorful or anything, but my other friends got old fashioned, the truffle burger, and another Texan and they seemed pretty okay with theirs. Nothing spectacular (which honestly was kinda disappointing!)   We also ordered ranch but apparently sauce costs extra and we didn't know until we got the bill. We told our server that we didn't know it was extra for sauce and said that he should've told us before hand it cost extra for it, but seemed like he didn't even want to accommodate for anything. After my friend spoke to our server, he seemed pretty annoyed of us, insisted we speak to the manager (for the sauce charge???), but he ended up removing it anyway.   Not sure what that was about but overall the customer service wasn't that great and I had higher expectations than this. Our server kept talking to his guy friend at the table across from us and only checked on us once at the beginning.  Probably gonna go another time but won't be back for a while. Thanks for the meh service!",

I had imagined martinis, but out comes shots. And they do serve 6. They were delicious and strong. I will go back just for those.",

They do not take reservations but we showed up around 6:30pm on Friday and didn't have to wait for a table.  We sat indoors but they do have outdoor seating with fabulous views of the Strip and the Venetian gondolas.  The truffle burger is, by far, one of the best burgers I've ever had!! Nice and juicy burger with smoked gouda cheese.  I really like how the burgers come with fries without an additional charge, you can upgrade to onion rings or sweet potato fries for $2 more.  Didn't end up trying a shake because I was so stuffed from my burger but they look so delicious!  Cannot remember the name of our waitress but she was awesome and very attentive, top notch service! Great place to go with friends or take the family out to lunch or dinner.  Thank you Black Tap for a memorable birthday dinner, I cannot wait to return!",

    "text": "Mediocre service and food. I came here a few weeks ago with 5 friends so six of us total. We were looking over appetizers and ordered their \"fried mozz\" and fried pickles. The server didn't forewarn us, but the fried mozz was a 4 pc. for $10! So that was nice, having to split that amongst 6 people.   Throughout our visit, we saw 3 different food runners bring food to the table next to us that they didn't order. One runner literally dropped an f-bomb after walking out with the duplicate milkshakes that those patrons were already sipping on.  We all ordered burgers and not one of us said \"this is really good\" we were all just surprised that they were just \"okay\". Considering I got a $19 Mexico City burger, I expected it to be crazy good. But the flavors of it just seemed mix-matched, it didn't blend well and neither did my girlfriend's Greg Norman burger. Their menu makes items sound really good, but the actual food did NOT deliver.   But to top it off, I was waiting outside their restrooms for one to open up. An elderly gentleman starts to walk out of one, and as I start to step toward the door one of the servers cuts me off and walked right into the restroom. It was unbelievable. Seriously the worst experience, considering myself and my party are all in the service industry. For this being a restaurant at the Venetian we all expected great food and great service, and it was honestly mediocre all-around.  Also, spoke with the manager on my way out. Pretty young brunette woman. I explained the gist of our experience, and she apologized just once and honestly just seemed like she was just waiting for me to stop talking. She was uninterested and made no attempt to make things right. At any restaurant any of us have ever worked at, the manager on duty would have gone above and beyond to make our experience more favorable. But nope. Thanks Black Tap!",

    "text": "Finally got the chance to visit with friends here last night, and was so sadly disappointed . Everyone in our party came in for dessert only, and we all ordered the shakes. While they were in fact very pretty to look at, they all fell flat on their asses as far as quality and flavor were concerned. For $17. bucks a shake I would expect nothing short of a thick high quality creamery style of ice cream, and rather they were like melted ice milk. The ice cream was simply disgusting, and reminded me of blended whipped cream with absolutely no flavor profile whatsoever. It was like sucking on whipped flavorless air through a straw. I mean come on folks, if you don't want to import special creamery ice creams; at least buy some Haagen-Dazs. Perhaps the millennials are looking for Strawberry Quick style loose milkshakes, maybe these are supposed to be skinny girl shakes? The kind you just snap photos for social media, but don't actually drink lol. In addition, how sad that I looked at the shake preparation area to find that your team is pre making the glasses up hours before so that the frosting on the glasses turns into inedible glue. What a total shit show here. I simply cannot believe the low level crap ice cream they are attempting to make their famous shakes out of.... Black Tap should be so ashamed of their knowledge and fact of serving this shit. $80. bucks down the drain for some pretty girl Instagram milkshakes, that didn't even come close to tasting as good as some fast food milkshakes..In addition, I knew something was off when the shakes came out in less than 5 minutes. Even people's food was coming out this fast after ordering. Hmmmm I wonder if their burgers are precooked? I can't see how hot food comes out this fast unless it is in fact precooked. I would skip this establishment, as it simply does not live up to any reputation it may have had from NY.",

We came for the milkshakes but decided to share an All American Cheese Burger with regular fries. The burger was cooked well and was juicy. Then we got the Cookies and Cream shake and the Confetti Cake Shake. Both amazing. I did end up liking the cookies and cream more because the cake was alittle too sweet for me but the presentation was A+! Be mindful the place isn't that big. You can sit at the bar or in the booths. However they have an outside area that overlooks the strip and the gondola rides. Which opens in the next few weeks for more space and entertainment. Overall we had fun and enjoyed watching what everyone else ordered.",

It has wagyu beef, fresh mozzarella, arugula, roasted tomatoes, roasted pine nuts, chimichurri and shaved parmesan. I'd suggest to add more of that chimichurri because it just brings the salad together.  I'm looking forward to trying their bison burger when they add it to their menu!",

Every time we have friends/family in town we take them here and everyone always loves it. The service has always been impeccable, a very fun upbeat staff, they must treat their employees well because they're always happy! One shake is enough for 2-3 people after a meal and they're all good, personal favorite is the cake batter! That slice of cake on top is so moist and delicious you can't go wrong!",

Waiter was prompt and paid good attention to our table.  THE TRUFFLE BURGER with wagyu beef was delicious, cooked exactly medium rare, fries i'm sure were great but the burger over shadowed everything else.  Others had the normal burgers and were just as happy with the quality and taste.  One person got SPICY KOREAN BBQ wings and even though they do not look like a wing place said they were excellent.  Definitely recommend",

The fries were nothing outstanding. My husband ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and thought it was excellent. The dessert shakes looked amazing and I plan to get one next time I go there.  We were very impressed with the quality of the food especially since it advertises itself as a burger place. The burgers did sound amazing though. Check it out for yourself.",

First off, we wanted to order to go to take back to our suite and we asked for menus (there is only 4 of us around, no one else) the guy in the picture gave us menus and he kept giving us menus non stop and I said ok that's enough menus. And he says \"well, you didn't tell me how many\" in the rudest and an ugly attitude. And I state back \"well as you can see there is only 4 of us\" and either way he could have asked how many in the beginning instead of being so rude. And then he rolled his eyes and walked away, without taking the menus from my hand so I just left them there. Vegas a place for people who vacation/travel and to get this experience from a restaurant/hospitality business is a no-go. This seriously was a major downfall of our trip because it truly was so rude. We all walked in trying to have a good meal and a good time and he really ruined it for us.   On another note: the food is really great here! The fried pickles were really good! The burger was reallllly good as well! I recommend eating here if you're craving a burger especially since if you're staying in Venetian/Palazzo and you want something other than Italian, LOL.  But even though the food was great, service because of the gentlemen really left a bad taste in our experience here, so hopefully they take him out from the front or serving, he was epic-ly rude.  Seems like the front staff just needs training because they looked like they all didn't want to be there and his co-workers just watched him be rude to us, even more embarrassing for us! I don't think I would ever forget this experience about this place and I hope no one will go through this like we did!",

We read the reviews for black tap and decided to venture down. We were without our 4 year old so we like to sit at the bar every chance we get. We think the service is better and some of the stories they have are awesome!  Now the food.   I had the california burger with no cheese and subbed my fries for a side arugala salad. The burger was seasoned well and tasted good. The side salad was a little over dressed but tasted good. My wife had the baja grilled chicken and also had a side salad. She liked it. The restaurant had a nice bar feel. Our bartender/waitress was very attentive. The bar is also really well known for their \"over the top\" shakes. We dis not partake because they looked like they had about 2000 calories. They looked awesome and vegas over the top. They also had a lot of great beers on tap but my wife and i had a pretty good morning at a Mimosa bar so needed a break from alcohol. If you want a good burger and an over the top dessert it's worth a try!",

First the wait was only 15-20 minutes on Fathers Day at 6:30 which was amazing. We were sat promptly and our server Carlos was extremely personal and informative. I ordered the Fathers Day Special \"The Boss\" Burger. This may have been the best burger I have ever eaten.  There were 5 of us (we all ordered different items) and everyone said the same thing \"I would order that again\". After dinner we ordered their Ice Cream Shakes, again AMAZING. When I go back (and I will) I will order the Shake first. Thank you to the Manager and a huge thank you to Carlos our server for making the night great. If you are wondering should I go or not go, GO don't look back and order the Shake First.",

Even at 4pm on a Friday there was already a line and the place was crowded and loud. We put in our orders and only had to wait a bit for the shakes to come out. I am still confused as to why we were served room temperature water. It was gross. We shared the shakes and each had our favorite. What a sticky mess was made. They should offer wet wipes. Our waitress was not very friendly or helpful. I sat near the prep area for the shakes and as you can see from my picture, it was very dirty. I know they were busy, but a kitchen/work area should be clean. We ordered some appetizers to share, but they were not worth mentioning.  I'd say pay Black Tap a visit if you have family or friends in town or if you are feeling glutenous.",

Caramel was really good - tasted like the chewy candies and not too sweet! Oreo was good, but had too many large chunks of Oreo cookie, which was good at first but then overwhelmed the shake... Cause then after awhile I was just eating a bag of Oreo cookies.  In general a really chill spot with great and friendly service. I was craving a shake which is why I came, but I'd definitely go again to try their food and drinks!",

Everything was amazing, tons of choices for sauces with your fries. With those appetizers we had enough for our party of 7.  The Shakes are where it's at! The Cotton Candy shake, the Cake shake, and the Chocolate Brownie shake were all amazing! Each one was shared by 2 people and so worth the price!  The environment was great and fun with great music playing.  I love the small mason jars they give you for your water and they give you a tall glass kinda looks like a wine bottle full of water. Lines can be long so think ahead about what time you want to get there and plan accordingly if its during a meal time rush.",

The server was amazing she took the time to recommend menu options that really fit our needs instead of just throwing an item out there cuz it sounded good or was popular.  The food....

    "text": "Update: After Samantha contacted me I decided to take her up on her offer of coming back for a second try. This time the service was as it should have been. Our waiter was amazing! He was attentive and very helpful. The meal was as delicious as last time. This time I ordered the classic American cheese burger. My friend had the Texas bbq burger. We also split the Cakeshake. That was like having a birthday in a glass. So much food!! The portions are huge.   Just wanna say thanks again for the second time around Samantha. The staff definitely stepped it up. The tables didn't sit unbussed and the servers were busy and attentive to the surrounding tables. Definitely a much better experience. Even planning to actually come back a third time. Just wish y'all would put one off the strip for us locals!   A friend recommended this place to me and Said they wanted to try it out. So we did. Upon arrival we were greeted and sat quickly however the quick seating was right next to a table with a small child who could basically turn around and grab off the table we were almost seated at. The tables were way cramped together. We waited for another table to be cleared as there were a lot of dirty tables. We were finally seated. The atmosphere is pretty fun and hip and they play a lot of old school music. It is however a bit loud so if you're looking for somewhere intimate this is not the place. Our waiter came and took our order. We split a California (turkey) burger and the black out shake. Definitely plenty of food. The burger was very flavorful. It came with a homemade pickle as well and they were kind enough to split the burger for us. The fries were crispy. The shake was fun and quite tasty. When dinner was done the waiter dropped off the check and then basically forgot about us to pick it up. He actually said he forgot about us. That won no points with me and he got quite the side eye. I'm not sure I'd be back just because as a local I hate going to the strip. But I might give them a second chance",

Our waiter was Michael and he filled us in on all the secrets. Yes they have a secret menu! With the burgers you can switch any of the meats, or any side for 2 which the sides are anywhere from 5-9 dollars but when you add them to you burger you add them for only 2 bucks. I had the crispy chicken Caesar salad it was really really good. The letters is so smooth and the chicken is bomb. Also got the Texan burger and it was also very delicious. The burgers are big enough to share if you like sharing. Lastly the Shake i got the cake Shake because Michael recommended it and the cake is shipped fresh from New York every day  and it did not disappoint! The service was magnificent and I think everyone should try this place out.",

The burger was great (we got the Mexico burger) and my girlfriend got the Vegan burger option. The fries were great (the sweet potato ones were amazing) and they give you 10 options of different sauces....... Other highlight was the fried mozzarella! It came with a little bowl of tomato sauce/soup. So good!!!  And of course! You can't come here and not get dessert! We opted for the cake shake. The cake shake was amazing! Not the normal \"looks good, tastes eh\" the cake was so good and not nearly as messy as i anticipated (even with a two year old in tow)  Our server Kendra was lovely. She was happy to give suggestions and at one point offered my son a lollipop from their massive milkshake candy bar, because his behaved attention span was quickly fading.

The $20 shaker drink that said it served 4-6 wasn't even a decent sized drink for 1.  My burger was dry (despite having a pink center) and too big/messy to pick up.  It was seriously lacking sauce and flavor.  We were crowded into a booth way too small for our party, and it made eating with a knife and fork a challenge.  The fries were flavorless. The shake was very Instagram-able but nothing special to the taste buds - very light on the actual ice cream and filled with lots of stuff.    My meal was so disappointing that I only managed a few bites, and the wait staff didn't even ask or notice when they took it away to become compost.  Between the two of us, my husband and I had a tab of over $100, and I left starving.    The waiter dropped my husband's plate on the floor and so he had to wait while the rest of us ate, and he wasn't even offered some free fries to snack on or a discount.  Go across the street to Sugar Factory for much better service and equally Instagram-able treats.",

    "text": "Wow! This place has insane milkshake concoctions! I bookmarked this place for some time now and I'm glad I can now say that I've finally been here. My friend was in town this weekend and we decided to come here tonight for dinner. We were immediately greeted by the friendly hostess who seated us with no wait at all. Once we sat down, our waiter came by to introduce himself and even gave us some tips on his favorite items off the menu. Upon his recommendations, we ended up ordering the truffle burger with sweet potato fries and the crispy chicken sandwich (with a kbbq sauce) with fries. We even asked the waiter if he could cut it in half for us so we could try both. He was more than happy to do it for us. Both burgers were delicious. The fries were really good too. For dessert, we ordered the cookie shake and loved it. I'm so glad we split the shake because it was so filling but good.   The only disadvantage about this place is that the burgers and shakes are pretty pricey. We were surprised that we got charged a dollar each for bbq and ranch sauce. But then again, it's expected since this place is located on the strip.   As a local here, this place is a great spot to take friends and family who are visiting LV. This place has great food and excellent customer service. We will definitely be back.",

First of all, if you're a local or are just parking in the venetian, this place is a little difficult to find in he casino. We found it after walking around for about 15 minutes asking how to get to it, and once we got to the hostess and showed her the coupon, we were told we needed to redeem them at a desk, which took another 5 minutes to find. From there we needed to get a players card. Long story short, we aren't 21 years old and couldn't redeem the coupon but we went to Black Tap anyway to see what the hype was.   We knew the milkshakes were huge and wanted to indulge so my friend and I split one- the chocolate brownie one. It was alright, but it looked cool! It's more of an aesthetic experience with the beautiful view of the \"lake\" in front of the Venetian and the artsy decorations inside. However, splitting just a milkshake and fried pickles was $25. I guess that's what you get when dining on the strip. Our waitress was very friendly at least!   For locals, I'm not sure if it was worth the trip but we got some cute pictures on the patio where we sat.",

    "text": "Location was the only difficult part.  It is located on the casino floor across from the sports book, not in Grand Canal or Restaurant Row like I was imagining.  Went just for the Crazy Shakes. $15 of amazing sugary goodness.  They are so popular, there is a dedicated location that is used to make them. Best part?  You can watch the action happen!  Shakes are NOT made in the kitchen, they are made where you can see them.  Each one is hand crafted carefully, and seems \"with love.\"  They do top it with a LOT of whipped cream, and that is what filled us up faster, then when we got to the shake portion, we were struggling.  The quality and presentation are superior to anything I have ever seen.  Each has their own unique flare.  For example, Sweet and Salty has pretzel sticks, Cookies and Creme Supreme has a cookie sandwich, and the Birthday Cake has a literal birthday cake wedge on top.  Excellent place!  Will have to come for the food to try next time, and of course to indulge in another Crazy Shak  My suggestion for Management if this is reviewed: slightly larger diameter straws.  The ones they use are simple soda straws, and I'm assuming most of the shakes have particles in them that gets stuck in the straw.  For example I had the Cookies and Creme Supreme with a cookies and cream based shake, and found the straw to be unusable.  SECOND VISIT 3/24/2018:  came for another round.  This time, had a turkey burger salad prior.  Salad was incredibly fresh, very large portion, and flavorful.  CrazyShake chosen was a Brooklyn Blackout.  Just like the first experience, this shake had a delicate display but was bursting with incredible flavor.  The key to this visit was our waitress Bailey.  She was incredibly fun-spirited, took care of our table very nicely, and communicated with us whenever possible.  It is people like Bailey that help make experiences worth the while in Las Vegas.  Bravo!",

It took them so long to bring my friend's beer he ended up going up to the bar. 2) the food is pricey for a burger joint and the food is borderline subpar/bad. My guacamole somehow tasted along the lines of spoiled milk. How does that even happen? 3) they're known for their milkshakes, and while they did look cool, none of ours tasted good. Tasted like dollar store ice cream. In conclusion, I don't want to harp on the place I just don't want anyone to pass up a good establishment for this one. Went to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday so it's a bummer that it wasn't at least decent. Don't make the same mistake we did!!!",

The shakes look impressive but taste like your basic milk shake with stuff added for glitz. For the amount we paid we could have gone somewhere way better. Sorry Black Tap. I won't be visiting again.",

Obviously they are well known for their insane shakes but had not heard much about the food. I decided to skip the appetizers (given I needed to save room for desert) so I went with the chicken sandwich topped with coleslaw, bacon and a side of fries. It came with a special sauce on the side which really making the sandwich (ended up asking for extra!) The place was really busy so I do understand the lack in service however I do feel their could be some improvement in that area. Now for the highly anticipated shakes, I went with the cookies and cream that came with an actual ice cream sandwich affixed to the side of the glass shake cup! To Die For! The shakes are huge but really live up to the hype in my opinion! If you're in need of a sugar fix this is the spot! Exotic shakes of all flavors to say the least!",

I was expecting to wait at least 30 to 45 min, but they got us in pretty quick, I think wait time totalled 10min. The atmosphere of this place is very upbeat. The music was loud, but enjoyable. The food was very good. My husband and I had the Mexico city burger, now we're not big meat eaters,  but we had to try. It was hands down one of the tastiest and juiciest hamburger I've had. Everyone in our group really enjoyed their meal, so no compaints. The drinks we ordered were tasteful and full of alcohol. I had the michelada royale, so yummy. My husband had something called the godfather 2, that was very very strong, but he liked it. This place is known for their specialty milkshakes so we ordered the cotton candy strawberry milkshake, hands down one of the best milkshakes we've had and I'm speaking for the entire group. To top of our wonderful experience here the service was fantastic. Our server Aaron was energetic, nice, upbeat and just a delight, he checked on us often to make sure we were all doing good, enjoying the food or needed drink refills. This is a place I will definitely return to and I highly recommend. Kudos to Black Tap.",

We came right at the lunch time rush and was told we could wait 30 minutes to sit outside or could be seated immediately inside. I really liked the whole vibe of this place, we sat right under these big neon pink lips. The women in my group could not stop posting pictures of the lips to Snapchat and Instagram.  Alesi was our waitress, we ordered our food and shakes pretty quickly after sitting down, and the shakes came soon after. The shakes are huge (and expensive) we split 2 shakes between 6 people. We got the cookies and creme shake supreme and Brooklyn Blackout. The Brooklyn Blackout was not great, there was too much chocolate syrup.  The Bison Burger was good, it was cooked well, but it was missing something. The flavor and juiciness was just missing.  The worst part of this place was our Waitress Alesi. She took our order, someone else delivered the food and she didn't come back until the bill came. We had no water for most of our meal. We then get our bill and realize they had already charged us 18% tax because we had 7 people. I guess she realized because she was already getting paid she didn't need to help us.  Food was decent, but could be so much better, and service was not good.",

I wasn't sure I could finish an entree and one of their beautiful dessert shakes. The strawberry shake was still huge but I literally felt like I was eating strawberries with ice cream. The flavor was impeccable.   I got the grilled chicken sandwich as a main dish. Dare I say, I might recommend this over the burger? It was SOOO GOOD. Our waiter told us it was his favorite and he did not steer me wrong. There were tons of avocado on it, the chicken had a nice Cajun seasoning, the salsa, I would eat this again and again if I could.",

    "text": "I am always looking for the best burger in Las Vegas, so whenever a new burger spot opens up I am always elated. When I heard a Black Tap opened up here in Vegas, I knew I had to see if the burgers and shakes lived up to the hype.  Black Tap is located within The Venetian, but the vibe I got going into the restaurant is much more of a Cosmopolitan vibe. It's a pretty trendy place with street art adorning the walls and neon signs everywhere. It's not a huge restaurant, but there are indoor and outdoor dining options which is always a plus for The Strip.  We took a booth inside by the Milkshake bar. Typically I am not a milkshake girl. I've been to Holsteins more times than I can count and have never gotten a shake, but when I saw them coming out of that bar area I knew I needed to try one. Ironically enough, the only photo I took inside Black Tap was of the milkshake!  We ordered the Brooklyn Blackout to start with. This is a chocolate shake with a chocolate chip rim. It's topped with a chocolate chip brownie, a mountain of whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and more chocolate chips. The crazy thing was the shake wasn't sickeningly sweet! Even crazier - it paired beautifully with the fried pickles we ordered.  If you are going here, you absolutely must get the fried pickles. They're pickle chips instead of spears, and the breading is so crispy. They bring them out piping hot and with a side of cool, creamy dill ranch. I'm not usually a fan of ranch, but the fact that it's made in house and has dill in it won me over.   After much deliberating we ordered The Greg Norman burger. This was made with a wagyu beef patty topped with house buttermilk-dill, blue cheese & arugula. What I thought was a tad odd is that they served the burger open faced with tomato and lettuce even though there was arugula on it. We decided against any additional toppings which was the right move.  This burger was perfectly balanced. The wagyu beef patty was seasoned to give it so much flavor. I would have been happy eating just that patty, it was that good. But then on top to have the peppery arugula and creamy blue cheese. It all melded together to make the tastiest burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  I was very impressed with how good the food was here, and considering it's at The Venetian it's reasonably priced. For a burger, a beer, a gigantic shake, and an appetizer we got out of there with only spending under $60. I can't wait to come back and eat my way through the rest of their menu!",

John A. was so amazing in helping our large party and making sure we all felt comfortable and taken care of. He made us feel like family.  If you think the shakes are just for show to take cute pics for insta, you are so wrong. I mean yes, they are super impressive visually and will make all your friends at home jealous. But they are even more delicious! My party ordered multiple different flavors and they were so amazing I couldn't pick a favorite.  The atmosphere is also super cool.  We enjoyed being able to watch our shakes being prepared. We awed over the frosting being artfully applied to the glasses and covered with multiple fun candies.  We had such a great time and I look forward to the next time I will be able to visit.",

The onion rings here are enormous, so order those if you enjoy them. They looked fantastic.   I enjoyed a burger salad that honestly had way too much \"salad\". I only lament this because a large portion was left unconsumed. About half as many greens would be sufficient and also reduce food waste. Just a thought.   Everything was delicious and we had fun eating here. We also managed to arrive around 6pm and didn't wait for a table for 4. There was quite a long line when we left however so go a bit early when possible.",

The allure of crazy big , sugar bomb, calorie laden shakes was too much and we ended up here on day one they needed a much needed boost after a 3am start to our day!  Service was fast, friendly and efficient- kept order simple - two beers, one shake to be shared by two ; quite easily, these are huge) and fried pickles!  Let's begin with the food - the fried pickles were the best I have had anywhere, hands down ...amazing!! Kids loved the cookie shake.. outside is covered in Oreo pieces - an ice cream sandwich and whipped cream atop a huge shake - kids were a fan and price was reasonable and beer was good  Well priced , good good and amazing shakes!!

We got 3 milkshakes, French fries with truffle mayo,  and fried pickles.  I can tell you with certainty that all of the above may have saved our lives.  The pickles were the unsung heroes of our evening.  They even put a candle in my friend's shake for her birthday!  The beer list here is great for a milkshake spot on the strip.  I found the voodoo ranger double imperial IPA on tap!!   It's located in the Venetian casino floor next to the poker room.   Bonus fact: Venetian/palazzo is like the best place for vegas local food and bev not only for the stellar restaurant row, but because parking is easy and FREE!!",

Be ready to wait a couple of minutes because there was a line when we went and they said that is the usual. When we get seated, we decide to order a beer and their passion fruit lemonade. Both were good. We order the truffle burger and the texan burger. The truffle burger did have a good truffle taste so they do not skimp out on that. It comes with wagyu beef, smoked gouda, baby arugula, truffle-yuzu vinaigrette, and black truffle mayo. The texan burger was also delicious. It's a prime burger with aged cheddar, crispy onion ring, bacon, sweet baby rays bbq, mayo. We ordered these with sweet potato fries. One of them came with sweet potato the other did not. This was not an issue as they quickly brought us sweet potato fries and apologized. When it came to the desserts, we ordered the cake shake (cake batter shake). This came with vanilla frosted rim with rainbow sprinkles topped with a funfetti cake slice, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles & a cherry. AMAZING. Please note these are big enough to share! Overall, we had a good experience and I would recommend eating here.",

Couldn't believe that I managed to eat the entire thing in one sitting but I did...but also made sure not to eat anything before I ate that. lol.

Seated promptly, and handed a menu with so many delicious options they leave you no choice but to return. We asked for some suggestions and was told the queso dip was popular so we tried that as the appetizer, definitely the right decision. Warmed perfectly, with just the right amount of kick to it, not too spicy, and the portion was a good amount.   For our meal we tried the Mexico City burger with sweet potato fries and the Texan burger with onion rings. Food came out shortly after we finished the our appetizer and it looked delicious we were excited! Now I will say we didn't try the regular fries, but the sweet potato fries were excellent, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The burgers were amazing such unique flavors and prime beef you can tell the difference in these burgers. The Mexico City had a nice spice to it and the cheese melted in your mouth. The Texan was great, and it came with some zesty bbq sauce that was also good.   Had to leave room for a shake. We ordered the cookies n cream supreme. It was amazing, the detail they put into crafting these shakes are out of this world. There was cookie crumbles pasted to the side of the cup, a whole Oreo ice cream sandwich on top with a lot of whip cream and I was in heaven. It was delicious. I met the manager John and he gave us a little background on the establishment and decor. He was very nice, as was our server Ashley! All in all it was a great night and I enjoyed my birthday dinner. Thanks Black Tap, see you soon!",

Environment: Hipster, casual ambiance, great for date night   Customer service: Bartender was friendly.   Checked in with us frequently.   What I ordered:  * Sour Power - If you love sour gummies or sour worms, this is your milkshake. Creamy goodness with a hint of tang.  * Bam Bam - Fruity pebble lovers unite! * Mexican City Burger - Burger patty was cooked to perfect and stayed juicy. Pickled jalapeno was a great twist.   Overall: I wish the menu was more affordable but I would return for another fun night of milkshakes.",

The waiter, Luis, was very nice and attentive.  Unfortunately, we were both disappointed with the shakes.  We decided to throw it down and order 2.....the Shake Special (red velvet cake with strawberry ice cream and the Cake Shake (party cake with vanilla ice cream).  The cakes didn't have a good baked taste and the frosting was bland.  The ice cream in both also left a lot to be desired.  The only good thing that came of this.....good pics posted on social media of our shakes.  Don't waste your time or money on these gimmick shakes.",

Appetizer: I order the onion ring since I'm a big fan of it. It taste alright by itself, and it taste awesome with the sauce.  Milkshake:  This is the main reason why I'm visiting. Since they opened at NYE, and I saw it on Facebook with those crazy fancy pics of milkshake, I decided to come and order a cotton candy milk shake. Instead of original combination of strawberry milkshake, I replaced it with vanilla milkshake, it taste so good!!!!!!!  The cotton candy on top was pretty soft, it melts fast on your months, the color balls surround the cup were chocolate balls. Further more, they had lollipops inside, sugar heaven!  Overall: Awesome milkshake! Friendly Service!",

He said that it was because of construction nearby and that they are having pest control out once a week. If this is an ongoing problem then they should be closed down until it is resolved. Customers should not be exposed to the possibility of this happening again.  Very disappointed and will not be back ever.",

We called ahead to see if reservations were needed, they said no, its first come first serve. The wait wasnt that long for a table big enough to fit our group. It was about 15 minutes. The atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing. I loved their music theming and their playlist was fantastic, I was dancing in my seat.    The food and the service on the other hand left a lot to be desired especially considering the prices. I ordered the chili cheese burger and it came with fries. The fries were delicious while the burger was okay. It could have used a bit more seasoning, but the actual serving size of the meal was more than enough. The main reason for being at Black Tap was of course the milkshakes. I had the Cotton Candy Crazyshake, and it was very pretty. The shake itself was a normal strawberry one overshadowed by all the bells and whistles of the cotton candy, lolly pops and rock candies.   Our waitress wasnt the most customer friendly. It would have been nice to know how they split their checks before hand. The receipts were all mixed up, but thankfully the manager came through and was more accommodating. I believe Black Tap is relatively new to Vegas so maybe a bit more training is needed.   I dont think the music and ambiance is enough to make me want to go back though.",

And they didn't , not only that but the food taste quality was very unflavor Not best burgers for sure, if anything try the Sugar Factory there Amazing from there food and deserts and for sure customers Service and you will not feel like you just spend your money and not had a good experience.

We show up on a Monday evening and there's a 20 minute wait, so, if you go on a weekend night, good luck. So we get sat. Then it takes another 20 minutes after we order to get our milkshakes. So. In case there's any math majors, we're at 40 minutes. Then we eat them. I'll go over the milkshakes in a second. When we're done, it takes ANOTHER 20 minutes to find our server and get our check. THEN it takes him 10 minutes to find a manager to split the check, which, why is that necessary? So we're past an hour now. For a few milkshakes. Which, really, weren't that good. The milkshake part itself is mediocre at best, the baked goods on top are crumbly and dry and you can tell they're ordered from the lowest bidder and come in frozen. The frosting and other stuff added to it just make it way way WAY too sweet. You could easily get plain milkshakes for the table and order just one fancy shake to share the extra bits but why? They're 15-20 bucks for a plain vanilla shake, frozen, pre-made, dry baked good, and way too much sugar. All of that plus the terrible service means: just don't go. It's honestly not worth the effort for an Instagram pic, I promise. They're pretty but you're paying for the showmanship, not for taste. Sigh. Why did Serendipity 3 have to close?",

She has been wanting to go for a long time and I promised to get her one of those amazing looking shakes.  Well, the line to get in was ridiculous and we stood in it for over half an hour.  Not even reaching the podium.  I finally went to the lady at the podium and asked about how long it would be and she said probably another hour or hour and a half.  I asked if we could get a shake to go and she said \"sure!\" So we got out of line and went to the bar only to find out that the special shakes are not available To Go and we could only get a small regular shake.  Which we did since we were exhausted trying to get in.  What a disappointment.  To make matters worse we could see Black Tap employees in the kitchen area having a great time messing around for a really long time.  So....   :(",

    "text": "If I could give this place a 0 I would. The only reason why I'd let this have 1 star is because the food was decent.  Last night I had my birthday dinner, which was a party of 15. And I had the worst experience from the moment I got there to the moment I left!   First, I called a week ahead to make reservations for my birthday in which I was then informed that they do not take reservations and they told me to call the morning of my party and they would reserve a table for my party. As I did. Yesterday morning I called as soon as they opened and they ensured me that I would have the table I wanted and not to worry. Just to be safe, I called when I was on my way to the Venetian and they then told me they didn't have any tables and they would only sit us at separate tables. I told them that it's a party and I would like to be seated at one table. They told me they would do so.   When I got there, I talked to the hostess and told them that we had a reserved table and she said that they did not have the table and that I had to wait in a long line and the wait would be an hour. Another worker came out and said that she could seat us and also told me they have a cake fee where they would charge me per slice for them to hold my cake in the kitchen and to cut it. I told her I would just do it myself so I don't have to pay and she said that's fine. She then seats me outside at 2 different tables.   30 minutes after my entire party arrives, our server comes out and asks if we were ready to order... but we never got menus!! I also asked her if she could turn on the mister because it was very very hot outside. She came back with menus and told me the mister was broken. So I asked for iced water. Another 20 minutes pass and she finally comes out with warm water and takes our order. After we get our food and eat, we had to continuously ask her for water!   As I was about to do my birthday cake, the server said she was going to charge me and I told her the previous worker told me they would wave the fine. In which she brought her manager to us where he basically scolded us like we were children. (I had made goody bags for my friends with drinks and all the servers were saying how cool it was and such a good idea. We were never informed at any point prior to being scolded that we could not have it). He said we aren't allowed to have the goody bags and that we were supposed to pay for the cake fee (WHICH I BROUGHT AND CUT MYSELF SO WHY WOULD I BE CHARGED???) He said he wanted our business but there were rules. Which is understandable, but we were never ever informed of any rules!!! They knew it was a birthday party as I made that very clear on the phone multiple times and they never once told me about a cake fee?   LASTLY, our server messed up all of our checks. I informed her before everyone got there we wanted separate checks and she told me that would be fine and easy.   She gave us all of our checks back and they were all wrong. Personally, my check was for $45 and some change, I gave her my card and she came back and charged me for $65 and some change. I was not aware of the extra charge when I gave her my credit card, but left it as I was already pissed off and just wanted to leave. As for the rest of my party, they all had trouble with their checks and cards.   After dinner, my friends and I were all trying to figure out how many Uber's we needed and we were outside the restaurant to the side and the hostess said that we needed to leave and could not be there. Why were we getting kicked out from a restaurant that we just spent hundreds at? And we weren't even in the restaurant!! We were in the hotel casino waiting. Not causing any problems or anything.  The whole night was absolutely ridiculous and ruined my whole birthday. Truly one of the worst experiences at any restaurant I ever have, ON MY BIRTHDAY.",

    "text": "While visiting Las Vegas decided to finally try Black Tap which has obviously been an instagram favorite for their decadent milkshakes. Disclaimer, I didn't actually try the milkshake because I think given the size of that thing you really need to come just for that and we were looking for dinner!  To start we shared the brussel sprouts app, which was deep fried and then came with a tahini lemon dipping sauce. The sauce was super unique and the veggies were fried to perfection. Highly recommend.  I ordered the mexican burger with a turkey burger patty. It was yummy, had pickled jalapenos, a fried onion ring and a chipotle mayo with cheese. I really like the buttered bun and overall it was a good burger that hit the spot. However, I have had better turkey burgers (less dry, more flavorful) My boyfriend got a regular beef burger with mushrooms, onions and cheese. He really enjoyed his and while I didn't try it he said he would come again for the burgers. The fries were okay but nothing special. They could try and jazz those up given that they are a craft burger place, maybe make the fries a little more \"crafted\" as well.  Sitting at the bar, we had a great experience. All the servers were AWESOME. Super friendly, attentive (constantly filling my water glass) and just overall a very welcoming bunch. Loved the decor and the 90s/00s music they were playing.  Ambiance gets a 5/5  Food 3.5-4/5  So I'd average the experience a 4/5. Next time I need to come back and try the milkshakes (if only for the picture :)",

We were seated right away and the walk from the front to our table was just amazing as we saw some vibrant wall murals and the boom box shaped seating area that is just screaming fun and gave you a very nostalgic 80's vibe. We originally came in for the shakes but as we were going through the menu everything sounded so good so we ended up ordering their famous All American burger, Chili cheese burger, Old fashion burger and Crispy chicken sandwich. And may I just say that it was the juiciest and most well seasoned burgers I've ever put in my mouth and all 3 of my children felt exactly the same way... but that was just the tip of the iceberg when we got our shakes that's what hit the spot not only for the kids but for a kid at heart like me as well...the shakes was insanely delicious enough balance of sweetness and creaminess it was just unbelievably good... it's a piece of heaven on earth!!! If someone is having a really bad day just one look and taste of this crazy shake will definitely turn it all around!!!   To top off our experience the owner Chris and General manager John Abin  even approached our table and checked on all of their other guests now that's good customer service... when was the last time a restaurant owner and a manager check up on you while your dining?!!! My guess is never only happens here at Black Tap where the food, service and Shakes are Crazy Good!!!",

While waiting for our party to arrive, the bartender, Jonny, was friendly and knowledgeable about the cocktails leading me to order a watermelon cocktail. Yummy & perfect for summer! If it wasn't 100 degrees outside we would've loved to sit on the patio overlooking the lake and the strip, but we opted to stay inside. We weren't too happy with the table we were sat at, but the manager, Nate was kind enough to move us to a better table for our group. He checked on us throughout the night to make sure we had an enjoyable meal. We started with the chips and guacamole and as basic as that sounds it ended up being the best guacamole I've ever had! Three of us ordered the truffle burger because we love truffles and it was amazing. Juicy burger with a yummy soft bun. Fries & onion rings were delicious. Comes with your choice of dipping sauce. I opted for the truffle mayo of course and it was delish. We finished off with a crazy shake and boy are they CRAZY! Crazy huge & crazy good. These milkshakes were monstrous. I ordered the cake shake that was topped with a slice of funfetti cake. The cake was super moist and the milkshake was a perfect ending to our meal. Everything from the ambience to the service was on point. Will definitely be coming back!",

If you were pouring half shots, you could serve 6, but by real pour standards, you'll only get about 4 shots out of it. That was disappointing. I ordered the Turkey Burger salad for my entree. I was nervous at first, because turkey burgers can go wrong very quickly. This one was wonderful! Not overcooked, nice and juicy, a little too salty, but overall really yummy. And I love fruit in a salad, so the cranberries and apple pieces were more than welcome! Honestly, wish there'd been more!! When it came time for dessert, we decided to split the Bam Bam crazy shake. After seeing several shakes come out of the kitchen, we knew we couldn't handle one of our own- they're massive! It was soooooo good! I highly recommend and would absolutely order it again... though I'd definitely like to give the other shakes a try too :)  My only real complaints would be the noise level. It was CRAZY loud. I had a REALLY hard time hearing my friend sitting 3 feet away from me and the server. Having to shout at one another got old fast. Also, there are only two restrooms for the entire restaurant. As in two one- room bathrooms. They smelled and were quite dirty. They could definitely use a couple more.   All this to say I enjoyed my first experience here and look forward to returning for more.",

The menu looked great but prices were unexpectedly high ($17 for a hamburger). We don't eat dairy so the crazy shakes were fun to see but no dessert options other than shakes. We got chips/guac (skip it- $12 and tiny portions) a chicken sandwich w/ sweet potato fries (large portions) and house salad (tasty but small). The salad came out about 20 minutes after the rest of our food, only after I asked where my salad was. The waitress didn't put it in when placing our order. The food was good but it was just overpriced, wasn't worth the hassle. $50 for lunch for 2..And we didn't even order 2 full entrees. Bartenders are busy, understandably, so get a table so you have more attentive service.",

    "text": "I was so intrigued to visit the restaurant because I absolutely love craft beer and amazing foodies. However, the experience was less than average. My mom just had heart surgery and as a result, needed to be in a wheel chair. The hostess said no wheel chairs were allowed. We were a party of 8 so had to wait ... one hostess said 25 minuets and another said an hour. The hostess said she could spilt the tables into groups of fours, across the room or seat a party of 4 at one time and the other party of 4 25 minutes later. We still decided to wait to be seated all together .. as we waited we ordered 2 beers and a Kahlua  and cream. The bar didn't have kahlua or cream. So because we were wanting an hour for our table, we got a kahlua drink from the bar across the room. When finally called for our table the hostess told my mom that she couldn't bring her kahlua drink in ... well, that is when I had enough... had the bar at the restaurant had the ingredients then we would not have had to go to the bar across the lobby. Lastly, they were out of wagyu beef at 7:00pm on a Saturday!!!! AND they are lucky that  a law  suit isn't being drafted because to say wheelchairs are not allowed is against all violations. She is handicapped and now has a disability because of her heart and we were not allowed to bring in her wheelchair, which is a child's size because she is so fragile. Needless to say, horrible service skills as well as handicapped laws. Please review with your staff disability and handicapped laws...",

The Truffle and the Old Fashioned Craft Burgers are are two of the best burgers I have ever had!! (seriously, that good!) I'd also give a quick thumbs up to the craft beer selection. The service and management are both an A+! Unfortunately I cannot remember my servers name from my last visit, but I recall my meeting with the manager John. It's rare you meet a restaurant manager that will take time to stop and talk to you and genuinely show interest in what you are saying. I'll definitely be stopping in here after work on a regular basis!",

We were a group of  10 7 adults 2 teenagers and a baby. When we approached the hostess to request a table, she was very short tempered and said wait time would be close to 30 minutes. Mind your there was no one else waiting and counter seating as well as bar seating available. We asked if we could be split between those two areas. She said she would ask, meanwhile she asked that we \"all move aside as a group of 4  walked in and she tried to accommodate them\" I immediately told her We are customers too and if you don't' have room for us then we can go elsewhere. Shortly after she got my husbands attention and magically found two table for us just a few minutes later.  I know is Vegas, but this Food is waaay too overpriced and milkshakes look messy life compared to their ads. Oh and Be ready to drop a $40 tip for their terrible service. Never again! #fail",

We randomly came in to try it out so didn't have our badges with us . We had our work schedules on our phone and paycom for proof but didn't seem interested to check it out.  Will we be returning ? Probably not.  We work in the industry and provide excellent guest service to Venetian guests and employees. I don't see why we're being treated so differently here.

    "text": "From the first time I saw pictures of the sundae creations on Facebook, I knew I had to get to Black Tap and see it for myself. I made the short trip from LA to LV and connected with girlfriends for our foodie fun, cuz that's what we like to do.    My first impression of Black Tap was not exactly what I was expecting. That being said, I should have kept an open mind.  The restaurant was far more upscale than I thought it would be, but definitely casual and easy going with a modern decor perfect for burgers and beer.  I guess I pictured it to look like a 1950's style malt shop based on the incredible sundaes. Glad I was wrong.  The host was very nice and I think he could see we were excited to be there. He sat us in a very cool booth where we had a great view of the the sundae preparation and all the candy on display.   I can't say enough about our server, Carlos.  He was very friendly and helpful when we had lots of menu questions.   Two of us shared a Texan Burger and onion rings. The burger was scrumptious and was generous in size, so perfect to split. I appreciated that it was divided in half in the kitchen at no extra cost.  My other friend ordered a side Greek salad and crispy Brussels sprouts for the table. I think the portions were very nice and we were all satisfied with our meal. Of course, we left room for that much anticipated dessert.  After much deliberation, I decided to get the Cake Shake.  Yep, it's a vanilla cake batter shake topped with a huge piece of white cake and sprinkles everywhere!    We had a terrific time, sharing dinner and dessert.  This will not only be a great memory, but I plan to make it a tradition every time I go to Vegas.  By the way, my girlfriend who lives in Vegas is also a chef and culinary instructor and she raved about the burger, and I think that says 5 stars!  Linda R.",

I got the Bam Bam and the cinnamon churro milkshake. The toppings on both of them were stale. The fruity pebbles rice krispy treat was hard to bite into and the churros were not good at all. Now for the milkshake, the cinnamon toast crunch one had almost full size pieces of the cereal in the shake. This is fine if it was an ice cream sundae, but not for a shake that you're supposed to drink out of a straw (the pieces were way too big to fit through the straw). Same goes for the whole pieces of fruity pebbles in the Bam Bam shake. The churro shake was overly sweet and 6 of use together couldn't even finish the 2 shakes. Like I said, these shakes were made to look good, not necessarily taste good. The fries were okay, if you're a fan of soft thick cut fries then you'd probably like them. The truffle mayo house sauce was pretty good though.",

Our server took our order and then within 30 seconds we wanted to make sure he understood we wanted the shakes after our meal. He rudely acted as if it was a huge burden on him. Our server then changed to a different person shortly after who had no clue what was going on. Did not wait long for our food to come out but it came out with the shakes. The fried pickles were awesome and are now my favorite. The dill pickle ranch was great. The burger was way overpriced and mediocre. The bottom bun was completely soggy due to the fact that the lettuce was not underneath the burger. The onion rings were not great and I would recommend sticking to the fries. The shakes tasted and looked good. If I ever go back it's because someone with me wants to get a crazy shake and I want fried pickles.",

    "text": "I've never had a lollipop or cotton candy garnish my milkshake but at Black Tap, this is the norm. My bro and I sat at the counter that faces the casino to avoid a 15-minute wait for a table and had a great time. He ordered the cake shake, which has an entire slice of cake on top of a milkshake and people looked at his shake the entire time he had it, until he took the cake off to save it for later. My cotton candy shake (which is actually a strawberry shake with cotton candy-flavored candy as a garnish!) was delicious and eye-catching as well; the couple next to us asked what both of our shakes were called after checking them out. Everything about it was a hit for me; the shake itself, the cotton candy carefully placed around whipped cream on top of the shake, the three lollipops that I saved for later, and the pink and blue chocolate balls that were 'glued' to the glass with frosting.  I was in cotton candy bliss. I didn't try my bro's shake, but the cake slice was big enough to eat later for dessert (we went at lunch time) as well as for dessert the next day and he said it was great. He actually wasn't even going to order a shake until he saw my shake. Although they cost $17 apiece for our two flavors, they were worth it in my opinion as I've never had anything like the cold, sweet, fluffy treat in which I indulged. A return visit for burgers and cocktails are on tap for my next trip to Vegas.",

Greetings were pleasant and the music fit the deco*.   As you make your way to your seating, your eyes are greeted with gigantic mouthwatering milkshakes. The size is not the only thing that attracts you but it is the artistic design. It's as if all your favorite sugar treats were eaten by a unicorn and the unicorn threw up rainbows on the milk shake.  On deck:  The cake shake  The cookie shake  No need to describe what is in the milk shake, the name and photo speaks it all, and the taste is also the same. Wish I could speak more about taste but that is why my 5 stars are missing one. There was nothing out of the ordinary. You pay for the plentiful servings and the taste of a sugary milkshake.   The service is on par! Michelle is helpful and all smiles. Thanks for the good service.",

So the conference was held at the Venetian Hotel (Sands Expo to be specific)- and my coworkers and I stopped here for dinner one night. We had read the reviews-- looked solid, plus I walked by everyday... and we wanted craft beer/burgers/salads. I ended up having the turkey burger salad over kale. So yummy! What a lovely portion, the kale was so fresh & the turkey burger was delicious. Their craft beers on tap-- large variety, I had an apricot IPA (?). My boss was happy as he was loves IPAs. My coworker also had a beer. Apparently, they also make fancy looked shakes (kinda like at Serendipity) but we didn't try those. Overall, I would recommend Black Tap. I have fond memories of dining here!",

Their fries were disappointing, nothing special and totally lackluster compared to the delicious burger. We were a party of 5 and got seated right away on a Monday night.

There were no seat covers and the hand soap dispenser was almost empty. I also enjoyed thier fries and onion rings tasted fresh. I want to go back back and try the other burgers out. I did take a bite out of my fiance's burger the bison and I wasn't a fan of the bison cuz I wasn't used to eating bison just not my cup of tea and I'm a buffalo slot lover. I also can't believe I was charged for 2 table spoons of blue cheese as well that got me laughing. I didn't try the shakes but next time I will.",

I've been seeing buzzfeed videos of their milkshakes from their New York location for a while so was stoked when they opened in Vegas.   The shakes are big, definitely 2-4 people can share one. Their most popular is the Oreo one but our server liked the sweet and salty one the most ( peanut butter based). I got the cookie shake and my friend got the cake shake. Both did not disappoint.  The actual piece of cake on the cake shake was very moist and delicious. It fell off quickly and was a little messy to eat but definitely enjoyable.   My cookie shake was also very good. It had a lot of chocolate chips which is not really my jam. I did enjoy everything else though.   The shakes were a little runny. I wish it had a thicker consistency.  Other than that the shakes were fun to snap, instagram and eat!",

    "text": "When you craving something like burgers, and want something to suffice your appetite all in one. You gotta try this place out. My fiance and I have passed by this place almost every time and always try to find other burger spots to top the next.   So on one of the days when I woke up craving a burger, Black Tap came to mind. Located inside the Venetian near the casino floor and I believe opposite of restaurant row, you can find this spot cracking during peak hours. We got lucky and went during the week at a little after the lunch crowd and right before the dinner crowd.   This funky eclectic style restaurant is known for their ginormous burgers and their decorative, yet oh so mouth watering milk shakes. So of course the pricing is just like any restaurant on the strip. Burgers and salads ranged $14-$22, which come with a side of fries with the burgers. If you are hungry before the burger or burger salads, they did have Korean wings ( which we will try on our next run), to fried foods, and the basic queso and chips or guacamole and chips to share.   Everything on the menu was and looked amazingly appetizing, however I chose to get the bison burger. Never tried it and always wanted to, so this was the place to try it at. My burger had a bison patty, arugula, mozzarella, pesto mayo, shaved Parmesan, and tomatoes along with French fries. My fiance ordered the Mexico City. His had a prime patty, pepper jack cheese, peppered jalapenos, crispy onion rings, and chipotle mayo, onion rings in the burger with a side of Onion rings. Unfortunately, we did not get the milkshakes as we knew we would be too full to even enjoy it. We definitely will have to check it out on our next visit.   The food: service was on point while waiting with the water and soda refills. So the bison burger, completely different taste than a Kobe, angus, or beef burger. Definitely super tender, extremely tasty and juicy for the first bite. One of the healthiest burgers, yet filling especially for someone that eats as much as me. The pesto mayo surprisingly went well and was impressed. Their fries, they are huge and perfectly made and wish they were unlimited as they can get addicting on each bite. As for the Mexico City burger, my fiance loved it. Each bite for him sufficed in taste, spice, and surprisingly kept him full for a majority of the day. His onion rings, were ginormous as well. If you are an onion ring lover, the place to go would be here. You will not be disappointed!   Overall awesome experience to say the least. Completely bummed out as we wished we had more room to have shakes for dessert. Hopefully we wish to be back sooner than later!",

The decor is bright and vibrant with great music and service was awesome!    It definitely was a great dining experience especially for the kiddos. They were blown away by there shakes!

I didn't opt to get a milkshake, but loved seeing some at other people's tables. They are VERY impressive.  Cons: I was dissapointed in my veggie burger.  They advertise these really beautiful burgers, but it was pretty unimpressive. Also, as a person who really thinks any meal can be saved by knock-out fries I was also let down. Their steak fries were rather bland. Not even a ton of ketchup could save them.",

    "text": "I was reading so many great reviews and at the end of the day I was kinda disappointed.   So Sunday my family and I decided we'd make a trip to the strip and check out Black Tap.  We were all excited to be hanging out!  First let's just start off and thanking the Venetian for giving everyone FREE Parking (woot woot!)   The restaurant is located on the casino floor at the Sports Book end & very easy to find.   Upon arrival the place looked alive and busy and the music was popping! A lot of old school hip hop, which I love!!    We checked in at the front counter and were surprised to get a table for 5 straight away!   The atmosphere in there is Fantastic!   The food on the other hand was average.... the crazy shakes of course are all the hype, and for $15 a piece they better be! Haaa haaa!   The crazy shakes are the main attraction and I would go back just for them!   Here's what we ordered:   The pizza burger with fries The chicken burger with fries The cheese burger with fries Sweet potato fries Cookies and cream supreme shake  Brooklyn Blackout shake  Regular shake with caramel   For 5 people and about $130 was pricey for burgers and shakes... I think I will just stick to the local burger joint down the road from my house ..",

Upgraded to onion rings and they were fantastic-tempura style. Didn't have room for. A shake but they are spectacular. Glad I got to eat here . Highly recommended for burger and shake lovers but please note they have options for non meat eaters too. My friend got the falafel burger salad and said it was awesome.",

The interior is super cute, with creative artwork and wallpapers throughout the restaurant. The milkshake bar looks like a big candy bar right in the middle of the restaurant.   Usually when I order burgers I always get a turkey burger but I decided to try truffle burger and it did not disappoint! The burger was just the right size and my favorite part about it was the two slices of Gouda cheeeeese. It made the burger so much more creamy and tasteful. They have add in options where you can add a fried egg or bacon or more cheese if you would like. I could have ate my entire burger but I wanted to save room for dessert! How can you come here and not have a milkshake! We ordered the Brooklyn blackout, this one is for all you chocolate lovers. Surprisingly it wasn't too sweet and we ended up finishing almost the entire cup. Their milkshakes are definitely made for sharing!  I will definitely come back to try a different burger & shake! We took a while to find this place in the Venetian, it's right next to the sports book in the casino.",

Safe to say that everything on their menu is worth going crazy over, not just the birthday cake.  Even though you take a look at the shake bar and you see tons of stale looking glass containers filled with the candy used to dress up the shakes, the ingredients still seem to be very fresh and not at all stale. The ambiance was also very impressive. Highly recommend sitting outside if the weather permits!",

I love oreo shakes and didn't drink half of this. Not enough oreos, the ice cream was weird...  The Burger (Texas?) was huge and impossible to eat but we gave it a go - we love messy burgers. It was okay, not bad not good.   The wings were pretty good, the sweet potato fries were good.  The guac we got with chips was the best thing we had, the guac was real and really good.   We were sat in a weird echo-y round thing, service was okay. Overall it was really expensive to have meh food.   I guess if you're into the giant shakes it would ok to come here for that, but as a regular visit, it was meh and I'm pretty easy to please.",

My party and I were seated in front of the milkshake station and we watched ours being made. It was definitely really cool to watch all of the shakes being made.   The service was awesome too! I was being a klutz and accidentally threw out my receipt. I went back and asked the manager to help me reprint, and he found my receipt in a flash and emailed it to me! It was great. Amazing food, amazing service. Will definitely be back!",

I'm someone who always gets water at restaurants and that was probably the worst water I've had.   Also, something that may be out of their control but it was extremely noisy. The small room in the back is covered in tile and the echo is horrible. We were almost yelling to be able to hear each other, literally 2 ft across from each other.   On a good note, their burgers were great! And the ranch was exceptional, both my boyfriend and I loved it and both ordered sides of it for our fries. The milkshake tasted good but more importantly looked amazing! Definitely instagram worthy but tasted rather ordinary.",

Lightly battered and surprisingly the batter was not soggy one bit from the pickle, was crispy all around. From crispy batter through to the crunch of the pickle.   This place may be known for their big milkshakes. Of course we ordered one. On the menu they list the topping that come with each shake and which base is made with it. You can actually switch out the base to a different one according to the toppings.   Sweet N' Salty with an Oreo base shake instead of the peanut butter one was a perfect combo.",

Love the 60 minute IPA he recommended, hubby loved it so much he took mine!! Burger was delish, got the old fashioned Yum, the horseradish sauce was such a nice addition. Hubby got the fried chicken with Korean BBQ sauce, wow! It was tangy and spicy, perfect with the sweet potato fries. The Shakes were a complete story in their own, Wow!! The couple next to us got the cake batter shake, I had to ask her if I could take a picture... she said it was better than her dads cupcakes! If you happen to go, request Jason, he was a wonderful server!!",

Cooked according to specification. Onion rings thick & yummmy. 2nd trip: bison burger salad & au Poivre w/peppercorn. Again both cooked as ordered. Bison good, nice because you can't always get. Au Poivre not as good as old fashioned....it was  a peppercorn sauce, not peppercorn crust. Sauce a little off-putting. Also got a classic chocolate shake.....wonderfully thick and chocolately. Nice beer selection....... AGAIN GREAT BURGER BAR!!",

We both decided on the Texan burger and it was as big as Texas to say the least. We topped the meal off with the Colorful Cake Shake and it exceeded our expectations! A heafty piece of confetti cake with real cake batter mixed into the shake was like the cherry on top. We'd most definitely visit again and most definitely recommend to anyone! Our only set back was the price. We're willing to pay for good food, but I have a hard time paying over $15 for a burger and fries and here you burgers start at $16-$20. Not terribly priced but not quite what I was hoping for. We also split the shake because it too was a little spendy($15). I'd probably suggest splicing the shakes anyways since they are very large and full of yummy toppings!",

Then we ask another waiter for info on the shake and he tell us it is going to be a 25 minute wait. But 5 people come out with their shakes and the table that i asked the guy about that had only been there 15 minutes get their shake. I tried flagging down the waitier but he ignored me. I flagged down the bus boy and he got me the manager. After talking to the manager he made the shake and said it was free.

I ordered a Cobb Salad and my husband ordered the The Old Fashion Burger with sweet potato fries and then he surprised me by ordering one of their Crazy Shakes, The Cake Shake for us to share! The Cake Shake was amazing! Not only was it very pleasing to the eye, it was so delicious! My husband asked to have the shake brought out before our meal so needless to say my salad didn't get much attention from me. Everything we ordered was delicious and the portions here are pretty generous. My husband and I could have either shared the burger or the Cobb salad (the Cobb Salad was huge!) with that shake. All the employees here were very friendly & helpful. Our server was awesome! She was very friendly, great personality & checked on us several times throughout our meal, not one of those that pretty much ignore you until the end & then turns on the charm for the tip. You've got to check this place out. We will definitely be back next trip to try a different amazing Crazy Shake!",

    "text": "Like many others, it was the photos of Black Tap's crazy shakes on social media that piqued my interest. When a friend and her daughter came to town on vacation, we decided to have dinner here on a Wednesday evening.   There was no wait, and we were seated in a comfy booth by the shake makin station which was pretty cool. I definitely dig the overall vibe at Black Tap... casual yet somewhat upscale feeling at the same time, servers wear t-shirts with lyrics from classic hip hop songs, the music played was all over the place but all good jams.   Our server was awesome, I wish I could remember his name. He arrived quickly after we were seated to drop off a carafe of water and answer any questions we had. When we ordered our food he made sure to ask if we wanted our shakes with our meal or afterward and put the order in with the kitchen accordingly.   We decided to start out with some fried pickles which were super tasty. My dining partner and I shared the Old Fashioned burger. It was alright, very juicy but nothing overly special in my opinion. The star of the show was absolutely the Fruity Pebble milkshake. With a strawberry pop tart, fruity pebble treat, candy and TONS of delicious cereal this shake was everything that I had hoped for.   Total damage for an app, 2 burgers, 2 crazy shakes and 1 normal shake with tax and tip was just over $100 which isn't too ridiculous for the Strip. I'd return for the shakes but not for the burgers.    Yelp Reviews 2018 22/100",

We ordered the Cookies n Cream Supreme, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Falafel Burger.  The only problem I had was that the crazy shake came out before the food, so I was almost full by the time I got my burger.  I was taken aback because I assumed the shake would be pretty sweet. Hmm... it was like a thick, creamy vanilla milkshake with chunks of Oreos at the bottom. The glass rim is dipped in chunks of Oreos and a round ice cream sandwich lay on top of the whip cream decoration which was not very sweet either.  The portions are huge! The side of fries can fill you up already before you even take a bite out of your burger. The chicken sandwich seemed like a good old chicken sandwich. There was nothing korean about it. Nonetheless, my sister said it was incredibly delicious. Now, the falafel burger was quite unique. The sauce that came along with it made the burger tangy and sort of bitter. Overall, I'm glad we checked this place out. The servers were all around nice and fast. Our food came out pretty quick, and I think I'll come back for another crazy shake.",

I would highly recommend the truffle burger! The hamburger patty itself was huge- super thick. Make sure you come here with an appetite because after dinner we split the cake shake which is served with a slice of white cake and sprinkles on top. Menu items were a little on the pricey side but nothing you wouldn't expect from vegas. Definitely would recommend!",

    "text": "I had to check this place out simply based on the photos of the most epic milkshakes I've ever seen. We were seated promptly. The decor is kitschy, and not really to my taste, but that wasn't going to deter me from my mission.   They have quite a selection of craft beers on draft and bottle.  Most of the food items on the menu are burgers, but they have burger salads and some chicken options as well. I understand that it's Vegas and things tend to be pricey here, but most of the burgers were in the upper teens to low 20s range, and the cost for six chicken wings was $14. Six!  When the food came out, it was made to custom specifications as ordered. My husband got the chili burger with no cheese, and I got the Wagyu burger salad and chicken wings. The wings tasted fresh, and the sauce tasted like a spicy teriyaki sauce mixed with BBQ sauce. Still, I don't think it was $14 worth! My husband said that his chili burger was good, no complaints. My Wagyu burger salad was essentially a good-sized burger patty on top of a huge amount of arugula, with some tomatoes, cheese, and pine nuts, but the dressing was super salty.  Finally, the time came for milkshakes. My husband ordered the Cake Batter Shake, while I got the Cotton Candy Shake. They were just as epic as the pictures make it look. You know it's good when people at the neighboring tables lean over to take pictures of your food! The milkshakes were thick and tasty, topped with a generous amount of real whipped cream. The glass itself was coated in frosting and had candies stuck to the outside of it. In my husband's case, the garnish was an entire slice of Funfetti layer cake! My garnishes were an entire lollipop, two sticks of rock sugar, and puffs of cotton candy. The cost of these two milkshake masterpieces? $17 apiece! Yikes.  To summarize, this restaurant is a burger and shake place at heart, that seems to have realized that making the food look amazing draws new customers in, who are willing to fork over an unreasonable amount of money for a milkshake. We experienced very good service while we were there, and the food was decent. Minus one star for salty food, being way overpriced, and weird decor/ambience.",

    "text": "Fun vibes with crazy looking shakes. We came here for those two reasons.   Waited about 30 mins to be sat which is understandable because this place is new, popular and on the strip.   Unfortunately we were super unlucky the evening we came because they sat us at a bar top overlooking the casino. There are two reasons they should entirely get rid of this area: you are faced away from the restaurant so it feels like you're not even there to begin with and secondly it's open to the casino and people walking by smoking cigarettes. As a non smoker it's extra disgusting smelling smoke as you're eating.   We asked to be moved and the ladies at the front told us we would have to wait back in line again. Seriously? Luckily another girl came by and told us two seats at the bar opened and we could have them. This helped because we could actually see the place and weren't smelling smoke from the casino any longer.   So we ordered a truffle burger, onion rings and sweet potato fries. Both sides were delicious. As for the burger we specifically said we would like it medium and the waiter said that's what the chef recommended. Unfortunately we received a rare burger that was entirely bright pink in the center. Our waiter looked at it and said he'd be back with it cooked the right way. As another 20 mins passed we had already eaten our sides. Can't say that wasn't annoying. So when the second burger came back it was charred. I wanted to cry.   So we ended up getting a shake because we were still hungry. The playful & huge shake was great.   If you sit inside the restaurant you'll probably have a much better experience and I guess we just got unlucky twice with the overpriced, inedible burger. Keep in mind the burgers here average about $18.",

It was more on the thick side so it was hard to drink through the straw. It's fun to get for the pictures, but other than the aesthetics I didn't find it to be memorable.   Greg Norman $20: I'm a sucker for burgers with blue cheese so choosing this one was a no brainer. The house buttermilk dill sauce came on the side so it could be added as desired. It was a good burger, but I don't think worth this price tag. The fries were just ok for me, as I do prefer more thinly cut fries.   Truffle Burger $22: I liked the truffle mayo more than the house buttermilk dill. I'm not that into Gouda on burgers though.   I also asked for sides of special sauce, truffle mayo, and creamy horseradish. The latter 2 were good. I'm not sure what's in the special sauce, but it didn't really taste special.",

We drive and park find it randomly in a crowded ally way in the Venetian, and it turns out the place is closed for a private event. Nothing was posted on their social media or online about it. Came out here for nothing. The place looked like a fire hazard for all the people there.",

    "text": "we were so excited to go to this place and it is WAY over priced! More then half the shake is just whipping cream and half the stuff you can't eat because it is stuck to the side of the cup for the \"wow\" affect. Plus $15-$17 a shake is a little much! They also brought it out before we got our burger. Duh! It was quite awhile before we got our burger too!  The service was really poor. We wanted our egg for one of the burgers cooked a certain way and they said \"no, we only cook it one way\" what! Then they said that about burgers too. You either get medium or well done. For a $20 burger - cook it the way I want it!!   I got the Mexican burger and it was good. I have to give them that. Great spicy flavor. The pickle was awful.   If you want different sauces it is $1 a sauce. We got 3 shakes and 2 burgers and our tab came to $107.00 for a family of four. We will NOT go back. But fun to try the \"over the top shakes\" once right?",

The menu has a little bit of everything and im sure picky eaters could find something they like. They dont offer much variety for their sides and this disappointed me.   The bartender highly recommended the broccoli as a side saying it was sooo good. It made my mouth water by his descriptions. Unfortunatly it is nothing worth writing about as its just charred brocolli with some teriyaki sauce. Nothing special or outstanding bout it and frankly it did not pair well at all with the burger. It just kinda was one of the worst suggestions ever and i love brocolli. I hardly finished half.   The burgers were decent. Fresh toppings and very filling. But hardly anything special than a typical burger joint. Our food came relatively quickly so that was a bonus. Although initially our order was given to other people first, but luckily thy never touched it before giving it to us. This error cost them 2 stars. Never ever should my meal be served to someone else than moved to me afterwards. And on top of it. We were not even given an apology or anything. Instead our meals were slided across the bar to us by the bartender as if nothing hapoened. Total utter complete fail.",

    "text": "The rudest bartender we have ever met. She was too busy pouring some kind of drinks she had stashed behind the bar into shot glasses for her co-workers to bother with paying customers. My husband and I, another solo woman, and two men were all seated at the bar waiting for her to attend to us. Rude, clearly annoyed by us, and blatantly ignored for a full 5-6 minutes. Thus, because of her and the previous lackadaisical service, we will never be back to what was one of our favorite little spots.   When you can't acknowledge customers at the bar you're working behind, and are visibly annoyed we interrupted your vent session with coworkers, it says a lot about your staff. All of us sitting there got to hear all about how annoyed they all were by \"stupid customers\" in your restaurant. I'm assuming because darn it, we all wanted to order food/drinks/shakes and give you our money. And I'm guessing the collective lot of us were being so difficult by trying to get your attention multiple times since none of us were being acknowledged while 4 of your staff were having their circle of shit talking instead of working.   The hostess was the nicest person there and that poor girl was working her tail off dealing with the long line of people waiting to get in and getting everyone sat, she was great. The rest of your staff can learn a lot from her. The wait could have been a lot shorter if the attention inside the restaurant were more efficient.   This is the 2nd time we've had really bad service here. I'm a full believer everyone gets a second chance or has a bad day, however, this seems to be the norm for this place.  Edit to add: the two young men working the counter where the shakes were made were also working very hard and efficient. One of them had to repeatedly ask a server to get the shakes as they were dripping from melting from sitting so long. He was visibly annoyed/frustrated and I don't blame him. My husband even jokes with him that he would walk the shakes to the table for him. It seems the issue this and every other time we've been have been the servers/bar staff.   Craving ice cream? Skip this place and try the Godiva soft serve in the Palazzo.",

But it's more of a hang out with your friends kind of place. Comfortable. When we arrived the waitresses were kind of all over the place and couldn't tell us how to just order a shake. Finally we just asked for a table and figured it out ourselves. The tables are very close together. So get ready to meet your new neighbor. Not a problem for me because I'm a talker. We shared a cake shake and it was more than enough for 2 people. You can actually go up to the shake bar and watch them make your shake. There are sprinkles everywhere. LoL! The milkshake was awesome. Made with cake batter ice cream. Yum! The cake was awesome. Presented with whip cream and an overload of sprinkles. I challenge you to eat this and not spill sprinkles everywhere. :) This was a one time thing for me. Little on the pricey side. Expect to pay $15-17 for a milkshake. The cake shakes are limited each day. If you're looking for something different I definitely recommend this place and their shakes! If nothing else it makes for a fun Facebook profile photo!",

Brussel Sprouts for an appetizer which were great . My chicken Sandwich was great . The birthday girl Wanted the cake milkshake but they ran out of cake . So we just called for checks . Instead of our server telling us in the beginning checks could not be split he waited until we asked after dinner had been completed . So the manager comes Out WITH ATTITUDE and allows us to have a 4 way split .  I wouldn't recommend this place to a burger lover because the food isn't worth the money and the venue has more personality than the staff",

It certainly lived up to the hype. Best salad I've ever had with such balanced flavors. It was a turkey burger with cranberries, avocado, green apple, bleu cheese, and kale. The staff was so friendly and the shake (Aka: The main event) did not disappoint. The Cookies and Creme Supreme was fabulous and was just like drinking an Oreo but better. We feel so honored to have been part of the opening night and to have been treated so well. Great atmosphere, awesome song selection. Super cool patio I would have eaten on if it wasn't winter.",

Multiple bartenders came over to see if we were all set multiple times during our meal and dessert. It was nice to actually be served at a bar and not wait! Our meal was served super fast and our shakes were amazing! They have a \"wow factor\" look but just as importantly they actually taste good too. Shout out to the amazing service and food. Had to knock off a star because my friend asked for a beer on their menu that they said they didn't have, then asked for another on the menu which they also didn't have, then asked for a coffee milkshake, also on the menu, also not available. Kind of weird but again, great food and great service :)",

Two, we were strip-side where we got to see the Mirage volcano erupt a couple of times and see the romantic gondola boats in the front of the Venetian. And three, we didn't have to wait in the massive line to get in the restaurant. Not only was the view amazing, but the food was great. My wife and I shared a Texan Burger & fries and the Cake Batter Cake shake. And my friends ordered fried pickles, the All American burger and the Brooklyn Blackout shake. The food and drinks were a lil pricey, but the restaurant is on the strip.",

    "text": "My husband wanted to go here for his birthday dinner simply for the amazing shake. He had a cereal and a slice of mint chip ice cream cake from Cold Stone for breakfast but wanted more of an indulgent dinner. We sat outside at 6pm and although at 100 degrees in late June but the patio was shaded enough that it was nice.  Luckily it is Restaurant Week here in Vegas! Depending on the establishment it can be for a week to a month where prix fix meals are heavily discounted and a portion of the bill goes to 3 Square. He asked for the 3 course meal- selection of 2 appetizers, 3 mains and any basic shake for $30, $5 of which goes to the charity. This does not sound like much but usually all that come to $50. I cannot eat beef so I passed.   We shared the fried pickles. Usually not a fan but delicious! He asked if he could upgrade giving the extra cost. He added an egg to the All American burger for $1 and upgraded to a gourmet shake from a basic for $6. Still, an awesome deal!   I asked for an Old Fashioned with a turkey burger sub and a Greek salad instead of fries (a $2 upgrade). The only bad thing is that instead of the salad they gave me fries. Within 3 minutes the salad was given. Hey, free fries! Mistakes happens and it was quickly remedied.   I was way too full to eat half the meal so I skipped on the shake to taste a little of his. He ordered the Brooklyn Blackout, holy smokes it was monstrous! I ate a little to taste and it was delicious! He could barely finish it.   So, prices are high but you get the bang for the buck with size portions and quality. I did slip that it was his birthday, no awkward singing but no comps. Still, I feel we were given more than the price. Plus, as we were outside so the view was really nice, of the gondolas and LV BLVD.   If you want to go to try it out, now it the time. A 3 course dinner is heavily discounted and goes to a good cause. Any other time, just was worth it.",

My brother ordered the Texas burger he loved it but he got onion rings with it wich he did not order. So he ended up with no fries. I ordered the Californian Burger wich is the turkey burger I personally did not like the meat at all it had a very strong taste and I just ate part of it took the rest home. We ordered a shake it was the greatest thing ever. My serves was nice but he didn't introduce himself at all. Our bill was $101 for two people.

We were right at the back and  it totally lacked atmosphere. Our waiter was friendly and extremely good at upselling. \"You only want 1 fried pickle for the table? you really need 2\" \"only 1 shake to share? You could really use 2\".  As we were jet lagged we agreed to it all. Kudos to him though.  He was right. The fried pickles were fantastic. The shakes were ok. More style over substance but still nice. Do they do free refills on sodas in here? Not sure. We didn't get any. The burgers were good.  Mine was severely underdone though. Positively rare. I was too tired to complain.  Everyone else's were medium. The burger salad options could use tweaking. I'd present them in wider bowls and toss the ingredients better.  Anyway, it was a nice meal but now I've experienced the hype I can cross it off my list as done.",

The sauce that comes with it, you could tell was home made and really made the dish. My mom got the falafel burger and I got the falafel salad and both were delicious. Prepare to come here hungry because portion sizes huge! I wish we could have taken our food to go but it wouldn't have held until we got to our hotel. Everything was fresh and crispy and you could tell they care about each dish. I'd go back here in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone who is near by! I also of course had to get the cookie shake and don't regret that decision at all - YUM!!",

It's kinda sad because we were really looking forward to a great experience since we are staying at the Venetian and it's expensive and our experience in New York was amazing.

As for food, I would probably go 3.5 stars, but service was great and friendly, great beer list, and the vibe of the place is pretty cool.   Black Tap is known for its burgers, crazy shakes, and 90s hip hop environment. We cannot comment on the crazy shakes, though they look amazing! We shared some fried pickles, which were good, but the oil they fried them in could have been hotter. Enjoyed a side of queso, which was also good. Eat it before it gets cold!!   We also shared the Chili Cheeseburger, which was decent. Aimee, our great bartender/server, told us that their 'medium' doneness is a bit under medium, which is fine for us but it's really good that they tell people that. A friend of ours who works at another spot says he thinks they over grind their meat, making the burger a bit mushy. I totally see what he's saying. Maybe it's opening kinks the need to work on, maybe not.   I'd definitely stop in again and sit at the bar. Check it out!",

    "text": "My oh my where to start?!? This place is amazing! I was skeptical due to all the hype, I thought it might be one of those overpriced burger joints with a popular name and fancy shakes that weren't that great...I couldn't have been more wrong!   We arrived at 5:30pm on a Wednesday and they were already fairly busy. We were seated in about 10 minutes and our waitress Bailey promptly arrived to take our order. Bailey was so friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive; she was fantastic! While waiting for our order we were lucky enough to be able to see all the crazy shakes being made, and holy smokes those things are massive and look delicious! They were expertly crafted and each one looked beautifully enticing in its own sinfully sweet way. The food going by all looked great as well. It didn't take long before our food arrived, and it was all perfection. We got the crispy brussel sprouts with tahini (I'm not a tahini fan, but this was good), a burger salad, and two American burgers (one with an egg) with fries. The sprouts were to die for; they melted in your mouth. The burgers and burger salad were cooked just right and were incredibly juicy (We eat burgers all the time and this is in our top 5 for sure) The fries were good and plentiful, and the sauces (chipotle mayo and buttermilk dill) complimented them well. After enjoying each dish it made us want to try the entire menu!   My only knocks on black tap is that it is very loud and not necessarily a good place to chat, the bathrooms are unisex (which can be gross for a lady such as myself who walks in to a toilet seat left up), and the napkins are flimsy paper that require you to use 10 or more with your burger. Those are all easily overlooked since the overall experience is pretty grand. The staff is efficient and friendly, environment fun, food stupendous, and prices somewhat reasonably for Vegas. Next time I go I might have to try one of those crazy shakes. I definitely recommend black tap!",

Got a cesar salad instead of the fries which was also very fresh and very good. Nice crunch factor just like the sandwich. And covered in delicious delicious croutons..  Later was with friends playing craps and blackjack best the spot and pit stopped for a drink and ended up also getting the regular Oreo cookie shake which was also on point, at that point where you kind of lose track of time, space, etc.  Will be back!",

I wasn't crazy about how close the tables were to each other and how the booth to my left had a seat facing our table, but at least we were seated immediately.  During our meal, great old-school hip hop was playing in the background, so that was another plus.  And something to note, a jar with utensils are on each table as well as thin napkins in a holder, which were hard to pull out.  I had to come here and get one of their Crazy Shakes, and it was recommended by our server to order it and have it served before the meal so as not to get too full for it.  I got the Cake Shake which was very good.  We put the the cake that was on top of the shake on a plate and ate it separately.  It was moist, very sweet, and pretty tasty.  The shake was tasty as well, and very thick when it was first brought out which is just how I like it.  It is definitely something that can be shared with another person portion-wise.  To eat I got the All-American burger with bacon added to it, and it came with the veggies and top bun on the side of the plate.  It wasn't the best burger I've had, but still pretty good, though I feel like bacon makes everything taste better :p  I substituted the fries for onion rings which were heavier on onion than on the batter, when I actually prefer it the other way around.  Definitely a place worth checking out if for the milkshakes alone :p  Not only Instagram-worthy but yummy as well!",

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share including mozzarella sticks, arugula salad, chicken wings, chips and guac, and fried pickles! I can't say which one was my favorite because they were all so delicious.  They have a wide selection of burgers but my friend and I decided to share the truffle burger since we were so full from the apps. The burger was delectable, juicy, amazing. I only had a few bites since I was saving room for dessert.  And of course, you save the best for last: the shakes. Best shake I've ever had in my LIFE. I have a thing for anything Oreo so of course I had to go with the Cookies N Cream Supreme and it was everything I had hoped for. I was already so full from the apps and burger but I couldn't stop slurping down my shake. My girlfriends ordered the other shakes and they looked just as amazing as in the photos.  The staff was great and very welcoming. They were very attentive and always checked up on us to make sure we were doing okay. Most notably though were Mikey and Jonny. It was busy but they took the time to take care of us and made sure we were happy. Thank you Black Tap for the amazing food and hospitality, we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Pretty damn good burger.  Milkshakes are photo worthy and sides and appetizers are tasty.  Though the burgers are steep at $16-22 depending on the meat and toppings, they came with a healthy portion of fries or a different side for an extra $2.  I had the Greg Norman - a wagyu patty with blue cheese, pickle, tomato, with added egg and onion and broccoli premium side.  The burger was huge and filling.  Meat definitely did taste better than a typical patty and fried egg had that perfect pop.  The broccoli was a nice side with a Chinese twist, better than your typical fries.  As a table we tried a bunch of sides and sauces and the sweet potato fries stood out as did the aioli sauce, with the Korean sauce a close second.  The milkshakes are as good and unhealthy as advertised.  They're big enough (and expensive enough) for a meal on its own but you're in Vegas so it's worth it.  Black Tap sits on a patio on one side overlooking the canal and strip and the sports book on the other.  Really prime location in the Casino and quick service.  Wine is super expensive and they were actually out of Chardonnay when we ate at about 6pm on a Monday (really?). The beer is fine but nothing spectacular; though at $9, an IPA is actually quite a good deal for the strip.  Black Tap is one of the better burgers on the strip and you could do much worse to get sustenance and drinks.",

Several staff, including the manager, thanked us for coming! I knew that the place was busy so i expected the great food that i had-but I was shocked to recieve IMPECCABLE SERVICE on a friday night in Vegas. Thanks BLACKTAP !

The burger was cooked to perfection and accompanied by fries perfect to milkshake dipping. The service has always been fantastic! Great place.",

When we arrived there was a line for the host stand and when someone came around asking for our party number we found out you could sit at the bar without waiting! The bar is full menu and if you have a smaller group it could reduce your wait time. They also offer outdoor seating. Of course we had to order a shake and we were not disappointed. For $15 it may seem overpriced but the shake can easily be split between 2 people. I got the aces high drink and it wasn't what I was expecting. The drink was too tart for me but I think that is personal taste over quality. I highly recommend this place for your next dessert!!",

    "text": "Finally satisfied a long awaited bookmark that I had to visit in Vegas and it did not disappoint.  This solid casual restaurant to fulfill your unhealthiest cravings. Though their specialty are burgers, their claim to fame are their crazy shakes which are amazingly good.   They're located in casino level of Venetion Hotel, adjacent to poker area. We got there late around 10 pm and the place was still bustling. Thankfully, they were able to accommodate a party of 5 and we were seated at the booth with no wait. Modern decor and whimsical wall art compliments the space well. There's a sports bar on right with TVs and shake bar in the back, which is where all the magic happens.  We tried three burgers, All American, The Texan and truffle burgers. With exception to truffle burger which was delicious, the others were  pretty standard and okay in my opinion. The burgers are served with fries, but you can substitute sweet potato fries, onions rings or house salad for extra $2. We all got the sweet potato fries which are really tasty.  The shake choices are creative and decadent, with all the toppings you could dream of to put you in a diabetic coma! Not only are they sweet and scrumptious, but they are huge. We shared the oreo cookies n cream and cotton candy milk shake. I don't really drink milkshakes too often but their milkshake I would drink over and over again. Both are so good! I actually enjoyed the cotton candy milkshake more than oreo. The base is strawberry ice cream which pairs nicely with cotton candy. The decorative tiny candy balls on rim of the glass was yummy and I couldn't stop picking at it. The shakes themselves aren't cheap $15-$17, but worth every caloric intake.  Service was fabulous from beginning to end. The staff here are quite friendly and attentive.  Overall great experience at Black Tap!",

The deep fried pickles were a good amount to share among 3-4 people.  I split the falafel with a side of fries with my friend. It was perfect to split if you're going to have other items.  For being on The Strip, the prices were pretty decent for what you get. The portions are good for sharing.  For desserts, we shared the Bam Bam Shake and our friend got the Cotton Candy Shake. Awesome presentation and it was really good! Among two of us, we couldn't finish one that we split as all the treats and stuff in it was delightful, but our bodies were asking us what are we crazies putting in?! Hahah. So good and worth it!  The place looks like a lot of fun and cool. There's a patio for warm days. The bar has a couple of TVs. It is next to sports book at Venetian so if you sit at the window to people watch, you can also see the screens at sports book. Service was pretty fast and they were kind. Great place for birthdays, treat yourself to one spectacular dessert, or if you want an impressive dessert for your date. Kids would enjoy this place. I mean, we couldn't wait to get our desserts!",

If you are feeling something on the sweeter side try the cookies n cream oreo shake you WONT regret it! It comes with an amazing ice cream sandwich that will having you dreaming about it for days after! Its huge so plan ahead to share it with at least two people! Do yourself a favor and come here next time you are in the area!",

You can watch the game from the bar window but I recommend facing the sports book outside so you can see every game!  The staff was awesome! This place is in the Venetian and is worth the walk over from anywhere. Drinks were great. Prices were great. Decor is all hip hop style graffiti and the music is bumpin'!!!

The day they announced they were opening in Vegas, I about screamed. I was so excited because I live about 4 and a half hours away and went frequently. Sure enough a couple months after they opened, I had a trip to Vegas. I wasn't too hungry at the time, so I only got a CRAZY SHAKE. I would be lying if I said I didn't get one for a picture haha. I got the Sweet N Salty one. First off, the shakes are HUGE! Definitely can share them with multiple people. The shake was ok. It was a peanut butter shake so it was even more filling but I have to say, I've had better. I only drank about half of it. I've heard the food is delicious and the burgers look good. So I would return and try the food but maybe not get a shake. Or at least not that flavor.",

    "text": "The Crazy shakes live up to the hype, and the black bean burger and fries were a very satisfying vegetarian meal!  I arrived in Las Vegas late on a Sunday night, super hungry after a day of hiking. I was staying at the Palazzo, and I was pleased to see that a burger and shake spot was open late immediately adjacent to my hotel. My friend and I were seated at the bar with no wait: it would have been about 20 minutes to get a table.  Both my vegetarian burger and his classic burger were well received. The black bean burger was well-seasoned and paired nicely with the salsa and other toppings. My fries were perfectly crisp, but a touch on the salty side. My friend's onion rings were nice and thin and had a tempura-like crust.  The highlight, though, was the Bam Bam Shake, a bomb of fake fruity flavor that was impossible to put down. Lots of places try to make shakes with crazy toppings, but this one was actually delicious. Almost every element, from the vanilla frosting on the rim of the glass to the pop tart topping to the fruity pebbles milk shake itself were well-executed and complementary. Two small improvements would be to eliminate the Laffy Taffy, which gets very solid in the cold glass, and to provide a wider straw that isn't so easily clogged with cereal.  I am excited to come back to Black Tap for an awesome meal and to try the other crazy shakes on the menu!",

Fries were done right perfectly crispy and everything came out in the perfect amount of time. Burgers are very well sized and filling but definitely leave room for one of their signature shakes. We had the Brooklyn whatever- It was this amazing chocolate concoction with brownies hanging off of it and probably the best shake I've ever had. I attached a photo of this one.

    "text": "Previously visited four months prior, an impromptu dinner during Las Vegas' snowfall discovering The Venetian's replacement for B&B Burgers & Beer to be a more fully-envisioned concept built around the same kind of Food, it was on Saturday evening that Black Tap Craft Burgers & Beer was again found jumping, a brief wait in the queue outside soon seating three guests in a comfortable booth.  Still popular nearly 18-months after opening, fair prices and Social Media savvy combined with excellent service undoubtedly part of Black Tap's appeal, it was learning from previous mistakes of ordering everything at once that three Sandwiches were requested first, the high volume of patrons creating nearly thirty minutes delay during which wait-staff repeatedly stopped by with updates as The Notorious B.I.G. rapped overhead.  Louder than remembered, both the music and several tables of teenagers on summer break contributing, it was in the middle of a conversation about the rise of \"upscale\" Burgers that three arrived simultaneously, Chef Isidori's signature Truffle Burger featuring ground Wagyu, smoked Gouda and two truffled toppings immediately setting a high bar while Fries were crisp, hot and appropriately salted.   Continuing with two SoHo staples built on Prime Beef from Pat LaFrieda, the iconic butcher's Patty unfortunately a bit overcooked in the case of Black Tap's Pizza Burger crowned by fried Mozzarella, it was instead the Chili Cheese Burger that impressed by way of both its medium center and Brioche Bun that stands up surprisingly well to meaty Chili and thick Cheese Sauce.  Underwhelmed by Onion Rings and their non-adherent coating, but happy with Sweet Potato Fries in a reversal from last visit, it was after watching staff build CrazyShakes for over an hour that three were finally ordered, the fact that all threaten to topple over a given but the bases all rich and creamy with the recently-debuted Churro Choco Taco Cinnamon Toast Crunch Shake particularly memorable as it tasted like Cereal Milk beneath a frozen treat that hadn't been tasted in over a decade.   FOUR STARS:  Although many will argue that there is nothing quite like a classic Burger it would be hard to claim Black Tap is not dedicated to their craft, a Patty of Prime Beef from Pat LaFrieda the base to several fun concoctions supported by a good Bun while the eye-candy Shakes are silly but delicious, and provided by great service.",

    "text": "My gf and I have been dying to go here. Finally came to the Vegas location and it's not what we expected. At all.  Started with the fried chicken and fries. Fries were the best part. Chicken was seasoned well but chewy.   Main reason we came: the shakes.  We ordered the cookie shake and presentation was bomb. Never saw anything like it. Definitely photo worthy. Taste: very bland. Didn't even finish it. I understand the price is high bc of all the work it takes to put together this shake but they forgot the basics. The taste of the shake.   I would not recommend. Unless you want to take cool pics of a shake. And not eat it.   Service was good. My two stars are for service, presentation, and the fries.",

    "text": "Very cool! I ordered the Old Fashion Burger and it did not disappoint at all! Delish and I recommend it. My daughter had the bison burger and also loved it. The shakes are crazy good. Worth the $$$ at least one time. I took a party of 14 teenagers and the service was impeccable as was the food.  They don't accept reservations and I thought that that was odd and inconvenient since I had such a large group l. But the hostess was very accommodating and in spite of the wait, it all worked out.  I wish they had not included 18% service charge on the bill then sales tax on top of it. I would have easily given the server 20% instead which over a $600+ bill, she would have scored. So that did not work on her favor, unfortunately but I get why they have to do it like that.  Cool place. A definite must if you are at the Venetian.",

    "text": "Black Tap is definitely doing something right! Their line was pretty long for a lunch wait, but only took about 15-20 mins for us to get seated. They have an option for outdoor seating, indoor seating, or first available. You may get seated at a bar top area, tables, or booths.  We got the main corner booth right in the middle and it was such an awesome time. Of course babes and I had to share the cookies and cream shake, arugula salad, and the chicken burger. We got some extra dipping sauces which are $1 each but I'm glad we did, cus they were yummy!   The shake was just as good as it looks! It comes with an ice cream Oreo sandwich which lasted throughout our whole meal. The salad was tasty, not bland at all. And the chicken sandwich was pretty good!   Definitely recommend this spot if you wanna have a cheat day! Located inside the Venetian, you have to go down the escalators and then turn left to find the hidden spot. :-)",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this spot but was super let down. I'll start with the positives...decor was really cool & the milkshake was delicious.   The cons...service was horrible, there was something non-edible in my food, empty plates on my table for 45 minutes before the waiter took them away, water was never refilled and the manager did nothing but say sorry wayyyy after the fact.   My husband & I both got drinks, which were just okay. Definitely over priced for what we got but not bad. The appetizer was standard cheese stick type app but the sauce it came with was really good. We ended up using it all to dip our fries in. When my burger came out I noticed what looked like a thick dark hair on top of my tomatoes. It took at least 10 minutes to hail down the waiter to tell him about it. Without saying sorry he took it back and then came out to say it wasn't a hair but just a bristle from a brush. Still no apology. He asks if I needed a new burger made or if I could just eat the original one...hmmm...now that burger is cold & it had something inedible on it. I asked for a new burger. By the time my new burger came out my husband finished his and we had a table filled with dirty plates, dirty drinks & empty water glasses.   By the end when we were getting ready to leave the manager came and said sorry but we were leaving at that point anyway. No compensation given. I never want to return again, if quality is lacking in the kitchen and the front of house. Working in hospitality on the strip and dealing with hundreds of tourists on a daily basis, I will let everyone know to go to another burger spot like LVB Burger, Gordon Ramsey's or the other amazing local restaurants that care about their patrons.",

If you enter through the main entrance off the strip, just take the escalator down one floor, hang a left and you'll see it on your left hand side.   The place has a cool and funky 80s' theme going with fun vibe. It seems to be a hit so there may be a short wait but it's well worth it. The staff is very friendly and attentive. And the burgers are delicious! My friends and I liked it so much that we went back the very next day for round 2. My favorite is the Old Fashioned Burger with Bacon of course!  They also have a full bar stocked with most of your favorite poisons. BUT, the bar that you really want to check out here is the shake bar. These shakes are some of the craziest, best looking, ginormous shakes I've ever seen. They have a bunch of different toppings and flavors. You can easily share  one between 2 or 3 people.   Cool spot, check it out and enjoy!",

The parking- If you park in the valet by the sin city brewing you just take the escalator down and follow the tile/ no carpet portion of the floor through the casino right to their desk!   The service- Our waiter last night killed it... considering I took (4) 10 year old girls out for milkshakes, he was a saint! The hostess however was not so friendly and didn't take us seriously when we asked for table for 4 adults and 5 kids. She informed us it was an hour wait and when we said ok, she then asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside? I mean maybe there is an outside patio? Her tone made it seem more condescending then it needed to be. So we waited patiently... yes 5 children under the age of 10 at 7pm at night waited... I will yelp about their parent later lol   The food- (things we've/ I've ordered throughout the 2 visits):  The Texan burger- hands down the best.. cooked perfectly and large enough to share with fries   The truffle burger- well I tried and I still hate arugula. The burger was great but I just can't get past what texturally feels like a bunch of weeds in my mouth    Spicy Korean wings- my friend would not let me try them but damn they looked tasty   **we have ordered every shake**  The cake shake- by far the best deal, I mean you get a legit piece of cake slapped on the top. Plus the shake tastes similar to cereal milk from MilkBar.   The bam bam shake- omg it's an 8 years olds dream but I hate fruity pebbles so it didn't do much for me! I did enjoy the strawberry pop tart.   Cookies N Cream shake- if you like cookies n cream normally or your a fan of Oreos you'd love this shake.   Brooklyn Blackout shake- way to much chocolate in this bad boy but wasn't sure if the brownie was undercooked? Either way the brownie was delicious even though I thought we may get sick from raw egg.  Sour Power Shake- Total stomach ache... but a child's dream if they like sour. I could only stomach 2 bites before the laffy taffy did a number on my filling.   The cookie shake- very similar to the cookie N cream but made with chip ahoy like cookies instead of Oreos... waiter said it was his favorite so I went for it only to wish I had went with my gut and ordered the cake shake again.   Cotton Candy Shake- I could feel my blood sugar spiking and knew these 10 year old girls were about to go off the deep end on a sugar high! It was very pretty to look at but so damn sweet.   Sweet N Salty Shake- probably the favorite among the adults and if any one has a peanut allergy you don't have to share.. I know that's mean to joke about but it's a good balance of sweet and salt.",

It looks like it wasn't busy from the outside (during lunch hour) but once you walk in, it is packed - always.  Customer service was awesome. The waitress was accommodating and very friendly. Got our drinks first then came back to get our orders immediately. The wait for the food was not very long either. Food was very good and plentiful. I barely finished my food and was hoping to have a little bit more room for their shakes (I'm a sucker for a good milk shake) but, alas, I was too darn full to order one. I was contemplating for awhile to order one even though I was full - didn't even finish all my fries coz I was that full. The burger itself was awesome. Juicy and very flavorful.  One thing that made me enjoy my first visit there was their music. It was a great mix of 90s hip hop from west to east coast style. I enjoyed it so much that I even asked the waitress if the playlist is available online but it wasn't. She said that it was the owners mix. So great taste LOL Overall, this place is awesome but leave room to actually get their milk shake.",

We visited with the plan to only have the shakes since we already had dinner.   I ordered the cookies and cream milkshake and shared it with the hubby. The shakes are big enough to be shared with multiple people. The rim of the glass was covered with vanilla frosting and oreo crumbs. The milkshake also came with a big cookie ice cream and a tower of whipped cream and cookie crumbs.   Needless to say the shake was pretty amazing. It cost $15 for the big elaborate ones and $9 for the simpler ones. I think that if you are planning to share it the $15 shake is more than enough and fairly priced.   This is a place I intend to come back to!",

That wasn't the case and I think our wait time was about 15 min.  From the outside the place looked small hence why we thought it would be a long wait, but when you walk inside there were more tables in the back.  The decor is very upbeat and hip long with the music.  Server was pleasant.  Very honest in his opinion of the food and descriptive in explained some of the things on the menu.   Food was excellent.  I never thought I'd be one to order these crazy shakes but I did, we did.  My brother wanted to order the shakes first which I thought was crazy.  He ordered the Sweet n' Salty Peanut Butter Shake, my sister, The Cookie Shake Vanilla Cookie Shake, and I, Cookies n' Cream Supreme Oreo Shake.  It was insane.  So I pretty much had dessert first.  Mine had a big ol Oreo Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich on top!  It was a lot to handle but it was so good!  For our meal we ordered:   They Greg Norman $20 - waygu beef, house buttermilk dill, hold the blue cheese, arugula   The Old Fashioned $18 - prime burger, crimini mushrooms, swiss (I replaced with pepper jack),  caramelized onions, horseradish sauce    I ordered The Old Fashioned and I liked it!  I wasn't too sure about the horseradish sauce but I'm pretty open minded and I enjoyed it! Especially dipping my fries into it!  The burger meat itself was big and thick.  It looks like they're freshly made.  The taste was flavorful and the burger was nice and moist.  The horseradish did complement the burger well.  My brother said the Greg Norman burger was excellent.  One of the best burgers he's tasted.  So this experience was pretty good.  Im thinking the only bad thing I'd say (which isn't super bad)  is that the music is kind of loud but that could just be me.  I think music should be heard, but I also think you should be able to hear the people at your own table.  So with all that being said, Happy Eatings!",

    "text": "For a restaurant that just opened at the Venetian, this place was a hot spot for many. To my surprise, there were people almost in every seat enjoying shakes and burgers. Yes, it was quite a busy day, but that didn't stop the swift service.   We were seated immediately with super friendly servers who frequently checked up on us.   Our meal:   $16 The All American Burger - This was the burger I got. I thought, you can't go wrong with a classic burger, right? And I didn't. But it wasn't impressive enough to merit a cost of $16. It reminded me of the burger from Ketchup at Planet Hollywood which was slightly cheaper and tasted just the same.   $19 The Mexico City - My girlfriend ordered this, but wasn't impressed. She came for the shake which was pleasing to her palate but as for this burger, not so much. I think the best word to describe it is lackluster. And for $19 a pop, I think we were pretty much disappointed because of the flavors.   $15 The Cookie Shake - One of the best most inventive shakes I've tasted. It was rich and creamy as it was filled with bursting flavors from the beginning to the end. I also loved the presentation of the shake which made the entire visit worthy and appetizing.   $15 Bam Bam Shake - This was the shake I never got to try because our friend ordered it but she definitely enjoyed it. It was colorful and appeared fruity. It's shakes like those that would probably keep us coming back again and again.   Fries - Not a fan. It was your standard, frozen fries that lacked salt or any surprise flavors. Very basic for what you're paying for.   Now, the boiling questions, would I come back? I think so. Just for dessert that is. Everything else could be acquired some place else.",

    "text": "Made a point to seek this place out inside the Venetian on our short trip to Vegas after seeing an Instagram post featuring the crazy milkshakes... 1. Milkshakes: Totally worth it. I got the BamBam shake which was covered in fruity pebbles. My childhood dreams came True! The shakes were surprisingly portioned well: we came with empty bellies in preparation & finished them without feeling uncomfortable. I like that they aren't HUGE. However, highly recommend sharing one if you grab a burger prior. 2. Service: They were slammed. We were told a 20 minute wait but since we weren't picky about where to sit we were seated in 10. The hostess was very sweet even when a large group of tourists came in and disregarded her completely when she tried to get their names on a list to wait like the rest of us. They ended up blocking the entire walkway of the bar area and demanded drinks from an unsuspecting waiter walking by (who later became ours) & he disappointingly obliged. I do wish the staff did not reward this rude behavior especially with a line of us waiting patiently right there. That group continued to be loud and entitled for the rest of the time we were there. It did put a damper on the experience for us and others around us. This prevented us from wanting to be there any longer- so we only ordered shakes. Our waiter was prompt despite how busy he was. He was flustered but handled it well. He ended up giving us the wrong change at the end of the night- giving us the total of our tab ($32- before tip) rather than our change ($68) but he quickly corrected himself and was apologetic when we brought it to his attention. Overall impressed by the shakes and would love to go back again to try some of the other food options! Management: please retrain your staff on how to handle unruly guests. I would absolutely be giving a 5 stars if that had been handled differently.",

A friend in our party received his food with a hair in it, it took over 5 mins to locate someone for him to only smerk and say oh I'm sorry very sarcastically.

Apparently he checked with the manager and it was ok for me to sit in the restaurant while I waited for the food I ordered. I regret not cancelling my order and leaving after the 1st guy, but then came the woman \"hi, are you just sitting here to watch the game?\" The manager came over immediately to tell me that I'm fine to sit there because at this point I'm pissed, standing up and asking if my sitting there is a problem. The food came out without further incident and was very good. Cooked perfectly. Since I felt so incredibly welcomed (sarcasm may not be fully evident here), I made it a point to ask for my check immediately, paid and left. If I ever get food there again, it'll be to go.",

Hidden gem- located in The Venetian, known for its Burgers & insane shakes, so we were pretty excited to try it out.  As we arrived we were greeted by a not so motivated hostess, but impressed by the inside of the hip location with awesome music and cool servers. After waiting a couple minutes in line for a table - we were seated in Dominics section, who immediately greeted us. He brought us a water bottle which was served with mason jars, pretty neat idea. He then went over the menu with us and pointed out some of his favorites. He totally got me on the Wagyu Burger Salad. Also he was very accommodating- I'm not a big fan of arugula, so he made the suggestion to mix the salad with 50 arugula and 50 kale. Let me tell you, that guy knows what you are looking for and knows what his restaurant serves, very knowledgeable. Great service!!  Bussers were also on point. Never had a messy table.  The shakes are pretty epic, but to be honest- too much for one person. We were 3 girls and we could've easily shared a shake.  Overall great experience! Only negative star goes out to the not so welcoming front of the restaurant!  But- we will be returning! Tip: if you have an option to sit outside- do it! Most amazing views of the canal and the strip!",

Could work on their vinaigrette as it was completely separated- emulsified would have been better. Will definitely have to check out the one in NYC",

The fries weren't the most unique things I've ever had, but they were good nonetheless, and if fries aren't your thing, the side salad was delicious.  My only complaint was that we were neglected for extended periods of time with our beverages sitting empty for a long time.  We would probably have ordered a few more beers and wine, but we weren't ever asked.  I get some are busy and there may have been something else going on that I'm unaware of, so I'd still recommend the place if you're a burger and shake fan - it was truly great.",

    "text": "We Decided to take my kids here for family Sunday just to try out they're famous shakes we have been seeing and hearing about. There we're six of us my husband and 4 kids and we decided to order 5 of the shakes. Our server was great she was friendly and attentive. No complain really about the shakes or the service, even though its $15 per shake which I think was overprice but heck its on the strip so I guess that is some what normal. Would we be back to try them again probably not. Its too overprice,you can get a somewhat similar shake at red robin for way cheaper. My problem was one even though we ordered just 5 shakes but since there was 4 kids with us they charged us an 18% service charge right away, If we ordered a full lunch entrees and all I guess I can understand but for 5 shakes i think its a little too much. Second was me and my husband split the bill which I clearly have the receipt for it, but for some reason they decided to charge my card full price even though I only signed $20 on mine the rest was on my husbands card. I tried calling the first time managers were all on in a meeting didn't get a call back,second day I called still managers were on a meeting again and asked for my number again! finally after seeing that the whole bill cleared my account and not pending I called again, they tried to give me the same excuse that the managers were in a meeting but I didn't budge I said I need to talk to one now, 2 minutes later finally a MANAGER! He told me he will look into it so hopefully they get back to me asap. Just be careful and make sure that you pay attention to the charges and keep the receipt. The shakes are big and I think its a little bit over whelming for one person, so its definitely shareable specially for the price. I ordered one each for my teenagers and they didn't even finish it because they got so overwhelmed with how much chocolate it has.I guess ill update this review once I get a reply from the manager hopefully they get my charges on my card fixed.",

The presentation was indeed great; we loved the rock candy and cotton candy much more than the shake itself. The shake we got, the \"Cotton Candy\" shake, was a strawberry milkshake with the weakest hint of strawberry I've ever tasted. It took effort to actually find the flavor. Realistically, I could have gotten a better quality (and larger) shake at Del Taco or Jack in the Box.  What especially irritated us was the pricing. In each description, you see you can add a supplement for $2. Expecting to pay $15 for each shake, we received the bill with $17 for each. It turns out, the awesome toppings that you see on the top of the shake aren't included in the base price; they charge $2 more. We wish we had known considering the waitress did nothing to inform us about this and the menu was stunningly vague about what a supplement is. (Seriously, who the hell calls a lollipop or a slice of cake a \"supplement?\")   I'm easily impressed by desserts and sweets, and for the $17 price, this shake might have been one of the most watered-down, worst shakes I've ever had.",

We had a group of 10-12 people and had called ahead to reserve a table and they said to just arrive 30 min early and they'd set it up instead of doing a reservation. About 6 of us showed up and the host was quite confused maybe new. She said they couldn't set up the table because the whole party wasn't there but the other host came and said they could do it. They then told us it was ready and put our group in two different booths?? So we obviously did not take that and asked if we could have a table. So they then re set up another one. This took about 25 min and very inconvenient. Maybe they need some customer service training.   Our server was Carlos who was actually great especially being frustrated from our arrival process. He was very nice, helpful, and attentive! I asked if they could sing for my friends birthday and he brought out the milk shake with a candle! So awesome.   I shared the turkey burger and cake milkshake with my friend and they were amazing! It's kind of pricy but worth the experience.",

The food was wonderful. We had the Bison burger, sweet potato fries with a side of the ginger broccoli..loved every bite...now the reason for 4 stars and not five..I was stunned to get my bill and find (not told) that I had been charged 1.00 for 1 small ramekin of Korean BBQ sauce.. sorry but that is plain wrong!! You have ketchup on the table  (I didnt use) and I'm charged 1.00 really ? Shame !! Thank goodness for Luis he saved the night!!..",

Both were cooked right and tasted great. I ordered the regular fries and there were great!  We ordered the fried pickles and they were delicious!  Only issue was on Saturday night they had a DJ playing and it was so loud you couldn't have a conversation. Our sever had to shout to us or lean in real close for us to hear. We saw two couples ask to be moved due to the loud music. Maybe just turn down the music a bit?  Overall I'll go back and try a different burger and maybe next time I'll have room for a shake.",

Also had the bam bam shake which was literally vanilla ice cream blended with fruity pebbles. Nothing that great!! We went for my birthday and all the waiter said was happy birthday. Don't go to get special treatment that's for sure. Also the seats are uncomfortable and the service isn't that speedy.",

    "text": "Labor Day weekend in Vegas. We decided to play tourist, so we went to the strip. We ended up at the Venetian and we were hungry, so we looked for a place we'd never been. While I was in the mood for a steak, but hubby wanted a burger, he saw the sign for Black Top and said let's try it. We should have taken it as a sign when we couldn't find the entrance to the restaurant. But, we persevered, found it and went in. We were told to wait for our table in a \"que\"...ummm....why wouldn't the hostesses offer the bar? Waiting in a que with kids in strollers wasn't where our head was at, so WE told the hostess that we would be at the bar. The bar was okay. Note to tourists: don't ask to eat outside, your servers disappear and you end up in a wasteland. I say the bar was okay, our drinks were acceptable but you can't transfer your bar tab to your table, annoying and inconvenient. So we get seated and we're given a menu. I don't remember what my husband got, I got the waygu Burger woth bacon and avocado. With those add-ons, your looking at a $30 Burger. I didn't finish it. It tasted funny, I've had Waygu before and this was funky. The fries were okay. But the burger was off. There were NO servers to be found. When our guy did finally come back I asked for the check. At that point I was annoyed and feeling a little nauseous. We paid a RIDICULOUS amount of money for what TRULY amounted to a McDonalds with a liquor license. Save your money. Don't bother. Go to Smashburger or In-n-Out, or if you're of the mind to spend the money, and you're at the Venetian, go to Canaletto or Grand Luxe.   Side note: remember I said the beef tasted funky? Yeah, well I got hella sick.",

    "text": "So I wanted to check out Black Tap last year on my visit to the Venetian, but it was always packed. Went for a late lunch and ordered a burger and a shake. I knew the shakes were a bit over the top, but what I got was a bad shake with a piece of cake crammed on top of it. The actual shake itself was bland and disgusting. I'd like to review the burger, but after an hour wait, I never received it. The waiter, who was extremely inattentive and focused on both task vs purpose and interactions with other staff vs customers decided to go to break. Another polite, short haired blonde waitress took over and had the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with my lack of service.  I love the Venetian, but this place will unfortunately fix its own problems with complete lack of service. To any management reading this, your staff needs to focus on customers rather than tasks and socialization. It's apparent that you're presence is absent.",

Place is busy to get there with enough time and they have seating at the bar.  They also have a  nice room in the back that is great for larger groups. So, we tried the All American Burger and The Mexico City Burger. Both were cooked to perfection and prepared just right. To top it all off we began with the AMAZING shakes! Sweet N' Salty is definitely for peanut butter lovers and full of flavor.  Sour Power  is a WOW! This one was just the right amount of sour and topped with whipped cream and nerds.  The Bam Bam Shake is the Fruity Pebbles shake can we say yummmmmo!  Finally the Cake Shake is the Cake Batter shake for those Funfetti cake lover.  If you are in Vegas or a local and need a fun place to have a good burger and some amazing. FYI if you love blue cheese try The Greg Norman.  I will be back to try the other burgers and shakes.",

We also shared a cake batter shake. It was ok. Nothing to write home about.   Second visit: I tried the truffle burger and my husband was right it DOES melt in your mouth. The burger is fantastic. Not a single complaint about the burger. This time we had the Brooklyn blackout and it was better than the cake batter.   No complaints about this place. It's a great place to try. It's one of those places you can say you went at least once. Probably won't go back unless we have people visiting.

The milkshake is great to look at, but as far as consuming goes - most of it will end up on the table or on your hand and napkins, just stick to the classic shake or the shake shot. The onion rings are huge and tasty, but the batter was easy to fall off.  The burger was the saving item of the entire meal.  Blue cheese and arugula made the burger taste amazing. Sadly, that was the only thing great about this place.  Prices are too high, atmosphere is too dingy, milkshakes are over-hyped, sides are mediocre and service was so-so.  I'm glad to have crossed this place off my list.",

We wanted to enjoy a nice dinner and the food was barely decent and extremely overpriced. They pride themselves on their gourmet burgers but they were dull in taste and not small in comparison topictures. Not to mention their $17 a pop, next to their $15 minimum price for drinks. The water they serve is warm of morning room temperature. Unhappy with the food, wouldn't go back and trek through the Venetian for it again.",

I ordered a wagyu burger salad and was told that they were out of wagyu... still paid the same price, though.  Three of us had burgers and we all ordered medium rare - all 3 burgers were bland hockey pucks without the slightest hint of pink to them.    Good thing we came for the crazy shakes!  I loved mine, but we did order a 2nd one and it never arrived, but by that point the person who ordered it didn't want it anymore, so all's well that ends well - but it's definitely a ball that got dropped.  I don't want to fault our server; he was very lovely.  The shake was fun, but note if you want them boozed, you have to get the liquor on the side.  (Holstein's doesn't seem to have this problem w/ their bamboozled shakes.)    So the shakes are good, but as far as burgers go, they fell far short of the mark.",

The presentation of the burger plate looked great but once you ate the food I realized the pickle that came with the burger was stale had no flavor plus it wasn't cold, it felt warm at room temperature as if it had been sitting out for a couple of hours. The fries didn't have a flavor either. The lettuce tasted straight like plastic. We were a party of 4 all of our burgers, lettuce and fries just didn't taste right. The time we got seated at the restaurant was around 9pm even though it's late I don't see a reason why the food wasn't fresh especially for it being at the Venitian hotel in Vegas. Really disappointed that the next day we all woke up with stomach cramps and food poisoning. Our stay was from 6/30/19-7/3 it's sucks that during the entire stay we all felt sick during our vacation. AVOID this restaurant especially if you don't want food poisoning. $100 spent on four burgers was definitely not worth it! Not sure what all the hype of this place comes from maybe the shakes? Pretty bummed we didn't have a good food experience here.",

I have one word: overrated. Also: disappointed.  Not worth the hype!   I ordered the Brooklyn Blackout milkshake with the cake batter milkshake Base. First of all, these milkshakes are much smaller than they look on Yelp or Instagram - they are the size of a standard milkshake, but heavy on top. Secondly, the brownies on the shake tasted like grocery store brownies. And my cake batter Base just tasted like vanilla milk.

    "text": "Decided to finally try Black Tap after being to several other burger spots in the strip.. the main reason was because my teens wanted the birthday cake shake, it was their birthday after all.. got there at 4:30, 5 min wait and our party of 5 was seated.  We waited 15 mins for our server to finally come and take drink orders. 15 mins later she came back with our drinks but not the shakes we ordered... umm ok. They were not overwhelmingly busy I will add.  We sat and watched tables seated AFTER us get their shakes, more important the BD Cake Shake we specifically came here for.. finally 30 mins later, food arrives, still NO shakes. I asked where they were? Servers response \"oh... well... we are out of the bd cake shakes now, it's a long story, they screwed your order up.\" Yeah no kidding ..  So rather than her tell us oh 45 min earlier , and we saw people who came in after get the bd cake shake, she choose not to inform us earlier. My girls ordered different shakes , which like everyone said are 50% whip cream ..   If you want to over pay and have beyond terrible service come here. Holsteins has same food and great service and real shakes they don't \"run\" out of",

We hd a peaceful 2 hour, leisurely dinner before the lines and the crowds came.   The food was amazing. The truffle burger is to die for. And the milkshakes are EPIC. The manager even let my son (bday boy) and his sister make their OWN milkshakes and showed them personally how they do it!  Level of service and manager are off the charts. I LOVE this place.

    "text": "My friends and I visited this location twice on our current trip to Vegas. One night for dinner and the next for dessert. We all agreed that dinner was just okay and felt that we should come back another time to see how the milkshakes were.  My sister and I ordered the California burger and she said her turkey patty tasted like it had too much fennel, kind of like a sausage patty. I got mine with beef and found the truffle mayo to be way too rich and overpowering. The fries were great but onion rings weren't. A friend got the chicken sandwich and enjoyed it, minus the coleslaw which was overloaded with dill, as is their ranch. Their fresh pickles were refreshing. Another friend got the all American burger and said it tasted good, pretty basic...kind of like America.   The next night (tonight 7/10/18) we had milkshakes. We came in around 10:30 and were seated behind the milkshake bar. Our waiter was nice and present (at first) and recommended we share two milkshakes. He told us we should order the cake milkshake as it was going to probably sell out soon. He's good. Later, after delivery of said milkshakes, he fell off of the face of the earth. We had to ask someone else to find him for us.   THIS IS WHERE IT GETS UNCOMFORTABLE...  He returns with a wrinkly ass receipt that he for some reason does NOT want to hand over and just kind of holds it in front of us with a bs story about \"you guys ordered basically the same thing as another table and I closed out their tab on accident and it's pretty much the same price so will you be paying in cash today?\" We all looked at each other a little confused and flustered but he still wouldn't hand over the receipt. He tried giving us a rough price estimate of the milkshakes we got and how it was pretty much the same as theirs. Then we gave him cash and he just sat there saying \"are we good?\" Aka can I keep your change. Hate when waiters do that! He walks to another table after taking our change and puts it in his pocket. We were given no receipt, which would have been nice since we are here for work and would have liked to comp it. We're not dumb. We know what he was doing.   He was a hefty Caucasian man with a beard and a backwards hat. Maybe management would like to ask him about it sometime.",

It's a lot to handle.  I also had a side of onion rings with chipotle mayo. The sauce was excellent. I really liked the pairing.  The service was great.

We were helped quickly and with smiles which always makes me happy. The menu is straight to the point which is also a plus. I got the Mule which was just okay(more liquor please this is VEGAS!) and we ordered the All American and the Truffle burger. These burgers remind me of Shake Shack with the bun and accoutrements but they have way more beef so def a difference. The fries were hot and crispy and plentiful. We both ordered crazy shakes spiked. I got the birthday cake flavor and the bf got the Oreo cookie version. This was both exciting and a little bit of a let down. First they brought out a shake that did not have alcohol(which one of the servers discovered before I had a chance to taste it), then once I got the spiked shake it had a weird taste to it. We had agreed on vanilla Absolut but as it turned out someone added red berry Ciroc. Vanilla ice cream does not go well with red berry ciroc . Overall I think this place is cute and the food is good. There is music and televisions around the bar area. I would return and simply skip the alcohol in my dessert.",

The burger is where things went vastly wrong!! The Buns was completely soaked and soggy on all four of my groups hamburgers. The fries were good and a generous portion as well, but no one wants to eat fries alone as a meal! So as we ALL ate our burgers bun less with knife and fork, we noticed other patrons doing the same. We then asked for a side of ranch and BBQ, which came in tiny, quarter full cups, that we were charged $1 each for. Would have berm nice for the server to mention this. In addition, the menu Says gluten free Buns are a $2 substitution which is fine because one of us has a gluten allergy but they charged us $4. In After this our server never seemed to return to check on us, refill drinks or take our desert order (restaurant weeks prefix menu) I had the Mexico city burger, done medium. The meat itself was fine, flavorless, but fine, but was paired with soggy (like the bun, notice a theme here?) onion rings and pickled japenos that had no spice but still tasted strongly of vinegar, almost as if the pickling process was not finished. A friend had the BBQ bacon with what appeared to be uncooked onion rings, but likely just soggy. After 30 minutes of asking around for our server, we were able to order our shakes.... Black cherry, coffee, cookies and cream....which all tasted like VANILLA, with minimal distinction in color difference. A fourth shake was not ordered because they have no gluten free shakes, a substitute was not offered. As we all began tasting each others confused as to why the black cherry and coffee ice cream looked and tasted the same... Both like vanilla!! And we were so  ready to leave. I realize server's live off tips so we still left 15% but truly I wanted to leave nothing. I will never return and encourage others not to try. Go to the burger bar instead, it's delightful!",

The shake was more of a fun experience but it was tasty as well. We ordered the shake with peanut butter cups on it and pretzels sticking in it; it also had a sugar daddy sucker stuck in it.

    "text": "We don't go to the Strip usually with the family but tried the food at a booth at Uncorked. It started off with us sitting in a line for an hour, because they don't take reservations. We were a party of six so we kept getting passed up by groups of four, who happened to be placed in booths that could handle six (two adults, two tweens, and two babies). It felt like we were inconveniencing the hostesses. When we finally got seated we realized that there was nothing to order for the kids. The Yelp site says kid friendly but we had to purchase an adult hamburger as the only thing that made sense for children. There is nothing specific for kids and the waiter made it seem like this was a common issue. The deserts looked amazing and we ended up purchasing several adult sizes to share because there was nothing child size. The overall service was very much lacking but the burger and deserts were delicious. As a local we will never come back nor recommend this to visitors, because an hour wait for poor service and good food at Strip prices doesn't make sense. Unfortunate, because we came specifically because of Uncorked.",

    "text": "New to Yelp, and wanted to post this a few weeks ago but have been traveling. I'm in Las Vegas quite a bit for work, and generally try to stay off the tourist track but agreed to go when a childhood friend who lives in town suggested it. I must admit, this place is the perfect Vegas spot for good, affordable food, and surprisingly, even though kid friendly, an edgy vibe. We started off with Wings, and then had the All American Burgers, which were OUTSTANDING! Not the cheapest burgers in town but they were very good. Also semi surprisingly was the beer choices. Some really solid draft beers to go along with the food. Then, when we were about to throw in the towel, the GM, a NY transplant named JP, sold us on a couple of shakes that, while a bit too much for one person, were absolutely the best shakes you'll ever have. Overall, a great experience. Good music (maybe a bit loud), service was pretty good and JP kept coming around, making sure we were having a good time, which to me is how a place should work. Lots of choices out there but I'm back next time I'm in Vegas. Bravo Black Tap.",

We went on a weekend and there was NO wait which is amazing for a strip property restaurant. For our appetizer we ordered the mozzarella sticks... it was the best sticks we've ever had! The mozzarella sticks tasted so fresh and the dip complimented it very well. We ordered for our main meal two chicken sandwiches for about $18 dollars each with two sides of sweet potato fries. The chicken sandwiches were so basic and there was no wow factor. For dessert they had a special going on for Chinese New Year that we got and it tasted so basic too, vanilla ice cream with a sugar cookie and golden chocolate coins. We came for the milkshakes and were very disappointed. Our bill came to over $120 and we left un satisfied and we won't be back. :(",

I have been to a few other burger places around town (Gordon Ramsey, Holsteins, etc.) and this is my new favorite on the Strip. I went with the 'Greg Norman' Wagyu beef burger. It was outstanding! Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The fries were awesome as well. I was happy I didn't get a milkshake as I could barely finish the meal. So damn full!! The only surprise are the prices but it is right on the Strip so it is right on par with other similar restaurants. The best part of the meal was a visit by the manager John! He stopped by to make sure everything was up to standard. He was very personable and takes pride in the restaurant. As usual, it was crazy busy in the restaurant and for me it means a lot when someone take the time to ensure you are pleased with the food, especially at restaurants on the strip. It was a great experience! Next time I come back I will get a milkshake! They look ridiculous!!",

Came over to our table to greet us upon arrival and sent drinks to the table. We tried their specialty Mule, highly recommended. Also recommend the fried pickles and Texan burger. Service was excellent. Very attentive. We were able to try every milkshake on the menu. WOW! The presentation and detail of these desserts are unexplainable, not to mention super yummy! We had a great time. Black Tap did not disappoint. Will definitely be back. Thank you!",

Anyways I ordered some drink with ginger in it , something mule ? It was horrible and really overpowering . I returned the drink and the waitress was really understanding and took it back . Little did the bartender know I was a table right next to the bar. I heard her complaining about this was her second drink sent back , saying duhhh it comes with that, tasting the drink with a straw and being a little insensitive , but that's okay , I understand everyone has bad days . She did seem to be more interested with the buss boys who she was all touchy with , which was a little awkward for me to watch next to my 3 year old daughter . Fast forward to the burgers , I ordered the truffle burger and I thought it was super good , a little pricey for what I received but I can't complain , I did enjoy it . Now to the shakes , I got the cake batter one which was absolutely amazing! My brother got the chocolate shake and I have to say, that was the best part of the meal and I have no problem paying $15 dollars  per shake. the restaurant it's self was clean and had a cool ambiance.",

When I arrived I waited about five minutes when a hostess came up and offered a countertop type seating which was fine bc it's across the sports book so we could at least watch the game while eating. We ordered queso dip to start, and each our own burgers. 20/25 minutes later our burgers came but no appetizer, we informed our server and she said they've been having kitchen mess-ups so she would check on it. We decided we would cancel I.T since our meal was pretty filling, I.T came out as soon as we informed her but they gave I.T to us and took I.T off our bill. All in all, burger was good, good amount of fries I.T totaled out to $46 (including one iced tea, we got special sauce for fries $1 charge for each) cool atmosphere but I can't justify the price when you can get the same quality burgers at five guys for a cheaper price! Nonetheless great place for a casual date night!",

After debating a few options on the menu, we went with the cookies 'n cream shake and an order of onion rings (sweet and salty, right??). The shake was overall monsterous and looked just like I'd seen it depicted in so many pictures. It was a delicious mix of Oreos, whipped cream, ice cream, and a cookie-wich. The biggest complaint would be the ratio of whipped cream to milkshake - I needed more shake in my life. The onion rings were crispy and piping hot, but super thick cut with a batter that kept falling off. I liked how light the batter was and the sauces that came with the rings, but kind of a mess to eat sitting at the bar! Definitely worth stopping by to share a shake with a friend or loved one - I wouldn't recommend trying to eat it all on your own!",

I think it was around $16 for the salad and $10 for the appetizer but then again this is on the Las Vegas strip - I asked for an extra dressing to-go and they charged me $1 - Waitress overcharged us on accident so we had to wait an extra 15 - 20  minutes for her to resolve the issue  Being a Vegas local I typically eat off the strip since there are so many amazing places to choose from. The food here was very tasty but I don't think I would go out of my way to dine here again since their vegan options are extremely limited.",

Chipotle mayo....nothing. Disappointing. Also, all burgers come medium or well done. I ordered well done and got medium. I did have a tasty beer and the shakes look amazing but I will eat elsewhere.",

I had the falafel burger and hubby had the pizza burger. He didn't love the pizza burger's sauce, he said it tasted like tomato paste but the burger was good. My falafel burger had a little bit of a burnt aftertaste and the feta was very dry (not flavorful and moist like I'm used to).   We also ordered a cookie shake and Oreo shake, the cookie chipwich that was included was way too hard to eat as the cookies are bagged ones that get hard when they touch cold. Not very desirable. They also overdo it on the whipped cream, which is pretty but hard to get to the actual shake..  We wouldn't necessarily rush back honestly. It was decent but not excellent",

One thing I will say is don't go during the busy times or you will stand in the \"club line\". Lol. It's literally a roped line you stand in outside of the restaurant until it's your turn to come in like the club.   The place is small and quaint and has a nice patio area.   The food was really good and fairly priced for the portions. ($80 for an order of onion rings which were phenomenal, a salad, burger, and milkshake) And I love the fact that they serve Wagyu Beef.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because of my milkshake. Even though it was good it did not quite look like all the pics. Which was kind of disappointing.   But it was ok because it was still good, my food was good, and the service was great. So I can overlook the fact that I didn't get an IG pic milkshake.    Try it out though. You won't be disappointed.",

If you try to order food for a kid... they'll charge $9 to melt some cheese on a hamburger bun and call it a grilled cheese. The best part is when they hand the plate to your 5 year old and it has a sharp knife on the plate.  Luckily I was quicker than him and was able to grab it first.    Lastly, the shakes are purely for fun. Don't expect them to taste good. They're a runny mess. The only really good thing about my meal was the sweet potato fries.

I personally didn't care much for the pickle but the onion ring was really good.  Did I mention the shake?!?! OH M GEEEE!!  Service was good. Our server was pleasant and personable. A few people stopped by to check on us which was nice.  I'm only giving 4 stars because my beer wasn't all that cold. I got the Firestone 805 blonde but I wish it were colder.

It was busy with people coming in and out, waiters and waitresses busily moving about and a barista who was multitasking like a boss!  Black Tap is located in The Venetian Hotel.  The amazing, beautifully designed Venetian hotel. It's a great place to have dinner and dessert. They cater to meat lovers, vegetarians, and vegans.  They specialize in alcoholic beverages that are uniquely named and described which helps you to know exactly what you're getting yourself in to.   I ordered the House-Made Falafel Burger salad which is a falafel patty that sits on top of a bed of lettuce, cucumber chunks, tomatoes, kalamata olives, hummus, feta, pickled onions, and a hearty drizzle of tahini dressing.  I also added a side of avocado because salads for me aren't complete without them.  This salad was big enough to share between two men with hungry appetites. It was huge. Definitely worth the price. The dressing was amazing. The taste of the falafel, however, was a little disappointing. It was a bit dry and tasteless and the feta overpowered the salad.  Next time I'll know to ask for the feta on the side.  My Idaho fries with their truffle mayo dip were delicious! I devoured those.  With all of the drinks to choose from I was overwhelmed so I let hubby choose for me.  He ordered a ginger, pineapple drink that was non-alcoholic.  It was really tasty, smooth and refreshing.    Their shake bar is out of this world!  If you love shakes you'll do yourself a favor by checking out their menu before you go so you'll know what shake you're going to fill your belly with.",

Came across black tap and recognized that this was the Burger Mecca that I have been in search of! On the menu are over 20 burgers, some of Las Vegas's best french fries, onion rings and fried pickles, and don't get me started on a 2,000+ calorie milkshake.  But let's go there... Black Tap has some of the best looking milkshakes ever (and I've seen some pretty awesome places with some pretty awesome milkshakes!) They're a bit pricey at almost $20 a shake, so know this much... your burger is going to cost you about $20 and a milkshake will set you back $20, so with tip you're probably looking at $50 per person which isn't inexpensive for a hamburger and a milkshake. But this is no burger shack or Shake Shack for that matter, the burgers are awesome!  Had The au poivre hamburger with some French fries (I'm all in France  , you here me?!?) Also sampled the all American... both out of this world. So if your looking for an awesome burger... Welcome home!  Only DISAPPOINTMENT was the lousy napkins that are in a cheap diner style on table top dispenser. For $20 a burger, you could/should get cloth napkins!!!  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes",

They said it was great, and it certainly looked that way. Had the coffee shake (as if that in some way showed restraint) and it was the creamiest ever.  The coffee flavor was perfection. My husband said the cookie shake was great also. The man next to us had a burger (I'm vegetarian so can't comment on that) and the most impressive onion rings I've ever seen.   Service was great. Friendly atmosphere. One word:  GO!",

    "text": "Located in the Venetian, it was a good time to visit bringing an out of town guest.  We arrived early for lunch so there was no wait to be seated. Since the weather was perfect, we chose to sit in the patio dining area.  It's shaded with umbrella's to keep you comfortable.  The patio is also great to view the strip and watch the gondola's float by.    My friend and I shared the Bison Burger as well as the Baja Grilled Chicken Sandwich.   The bison was fantastic.  It's topped with fresh mozzarella, pesto mayo, arugula, shaved parmesan and roasted tomatoes.  I would not hesitate to order this again.    The chicken sandwich did not disappoint.  The chicken has a cajun season and then topped with avocado, salsa, bacon, pepper jack and chipotle mayo.  Tons of flavor and totally satisfying.  Each sandwich is served with an abundant amount of fries.  The sandwich plates could really be shared especially if you plan on ordering one of their signature shakes!  Speaking of shakes, wow.  Get ready to be floored by the amount of ingredients they can fit into one shake.  I was already stuffed from lunch but I couldn't pass up trying the Sweet N Salty shake. They frost the rim with chocolate so M&M's can be stuck to it.  The peanut butter shake has pretzel rods, a sugar daddy, whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.  There are 8 Crazyshakes which they feature on the menu but also have an additional shake for the month.  It's a splurge that is completely worth the calories.    Thanks Blacktap for showing us how Vegas does it!",

    "text": "My friends and I were at Palazzo/Venetian for Restaurant Week at Delmonico's. One of our friends had mentioned Black Tap for huge shakes. We had decided to come check it out after lunch. There was a small line waiting outside the poker area. We had walked up to ask how to wait was and it was quoted to be around 15 minutes. We were called in maybe less than 5 minutes and were sat in the back in a booth. The booth was a bit squished for 6 people. Not really squished in length, but space between seat and table. Not for the fluffy. HAHA   Since we were pretty full, we decided to get 1-2 shakes to share between the 6 of us. Especially since we were told they were HUGEEE (quoting a friend... \"2-3x the size of steak & shakes\").... yeah it isnt LOL fyi !  We had ordered \"The Cakeshake\" and a \"Brooklyn Blackout\"  The \"Brooklyn Blackout\" is a chocolate shake w/ chocolate frosted rim w/ mini chocolate chips topped w/ two chocolate brownies, whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle.   HOLY CHOCOLATE ! AND INSTA-DIABETES ! SO SWEET ! And the brownies were as hard as a rock !   \"The Cakeshake\" is a cake batter shake w/ vanilla frosted rim w/ rainbow sprinkles topped w/ a funfetti cake slice, whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles, and a cherry.   The cake on here was MUCH better than the brownies on the brooklyn blackout, but it was just as sweet  Overall, REALLLLY sweet place. Yeah its a dessert. Its supposed to be sweet. But damn.... Even between the 6 of us, we barely finished 1/2 of each shake. Even on the way out, I did NOT see a single shake finished. Most at best, 1/2 done as well with the \"cake topping\" 1/2 done too...   Oh, about the size, they are definitely NOT huge. same size as steak and shake, in terms of amount of milkshake, if not even less. its only \"HUGE\" in terms of size, because of the \"cake topping\".   The shakes are definitely \"FOR THE GRAM\" and that's about it. LOL Thank god for the water they give you. OH they use these cute little small mason jars for water cups. But anyway, thank god for the water.",

    "text": "This was our second trip to Black Tap and our first time getting one of their famous milkshakes.  With this being my wife's birthday, she really wanted to take advantage of us playing hookie from work we went and had lunch.   I believe because it was a Monday and we got there after the lunch hour, we were able to walk in. The greeter staff was very nice and laid back. We sat next to the bar were some folks were hanging out. The dessert bar is the center piece of the layout where you have a front row seat to see your milkshake masterpiece being built.  The decor is great, there are booth, tables and even a few enclaves for seating.  Food, so amazing!!!!, my advice is if your going to get a milkshake, share!!!! I promise you will not leave hungry.   The restaurant has a DJ booth so on weekend it looks like a late night place to hang. There is seating outside on the strip and being located at the Venetian, there is great people watching and activity to see.   In the end, I think for the amount you pay for the the amount you get, Black Tap is a great value and a cool unique place to have some time out of the Vegas sun and hang out.",

The service is friendly (they let us split the check into 4 different bills as it was a mom and daughter weekend and there were 6 sets of us).   burgers are great... juicy and big. there are a lot of options, so it was a little hard to decide. The fries that come with it are nice too.  The star is the freak milkshake, I got the cake shake and the cake was really good (surprisingly) and the milkshake was delectable, delicious, and decadent. Ice cream is my weakness and while I had a few bites of the cake and shared with the rest of the group, I finished that milkshake with no problems. It was the star!",

That's one of the things this place is famous for. They have many options and average at $15 a shake. You could definitely share one they are huge! I loved the art throughout the restaurant. They have a bar and an outside patio. We didn't try the food but it looked just as good. There was a wait but it wasn't bad. Would definitely recommend during your trip to Vegas.

I followed their Instagram page and obsessed over how amazing everything looks and now I'm just disappointed.   Ordered the fried chicken sandwich and the cookie shake. My friend ordered the churro shake and a burger.  Both of us can agree the fries were soggy. Our whole group of 4 people didn't finish it. The chicken sandwich was probably one of the worst I've ever tried and I'm a huge chicken sandwich person. Had no taste, very bland.  The churros on the shake were super hard. My friends couldn't even eat them. The chocolate taco that comes on it was soggy af. The cookie shake was a complete joke. Presentation was amazing but the shake was the most bland and basic thing I've ever tried. I'd honestly get a shake from McDonald's than ever come back here.  Let's not even mention the prices. Good lord 15 dollars for a shit shake. Maybe if the shake was actually delicious but the shake was soooo bland. Literally don't understand why the price is so high.",

It is located on the casino floor of The Venetian by the poker tables.   The line was long when we got here, but it is first come first serve seating at the bar which is where we ended up at.  They have a fully stocked bar with two TVs and you can see the kitchen from where you sit.  They have specialty burgers (see pic for menu). I tried the Truffle Burger with onion rings. A bit oily but flavorful. The onion in the onion ring was sweet and the coating crisp (it was messy to eat though).  They have two individual stall restrooms inside the restaurant which was nice since you didn't have to go into the casino to find a restroom. And, the toilet paper is soft too which is always a plus.  Staff was friendly, food good, and establishment clean.",

The wings and fries are also just alright. Nothing really stood out other than the beautiful shake. When the shake is served to you, make sure you take your photos quickly as it will start melting in 5 minutes. I wasn't a fan of the shake but maybe I just need to order a different one.  There is a line to dine here but you can sit at the bar as it is open seating. The bartenders were all nice. Overall, I would return when there's no line.",

    "text": "All this hyper for a mediocre shakeI don't know what went wrong. The food or the service  I don't like leaving bad reviews BUT, I review all the places I go in Vegas. It was not a busy day for them at all. We walked in and passed the bar where they make all the \"cool\" shakes. I took a moment to embrace that area in and the vibe. You would think someone, would greet me and maybe do some small talk. NOPE  The bar looked a little bland with the ingredients and array of candy. Everything looked rather light and not fresh when it came to the candy. When you go to these type of candy shake places, always pay attention to this. You'll see why...  We sat in the beautiful patio and it was a lovely day outside. I was rather excited to review the menu and see what all the hype was about.   It was simple. VERY, simple. I was like, whaaat? Okay, I'll give it a shot. We ordered a birthday cake shake and it was small. The cake which was the centerpiece was a bit dry. The shake just vanilla ice-cream swirled with sprinkles. The hype is just to make it look pretty. Like half the shake you normally get from restaurants. The salads are basic. Don't get this at all. The burgers were small and the only part that was good were the fries. So, do fries and try a shake to experience it for yourself  To top it off... our waiter must have been having a bad day. The most sarcastic waiter I've ever met. This was the sour cherry to dining here.   If you have questions or have a better experience let me know. I wouldn't mind giving it another shot. Vegas experiences always change.",

    "text": "Hubby and I visited this place twice while on our very short trip. So we obviously enjoyed ourselves. Both nights were around 9p - first a Sunday and then a Monday. The first time it was just us and our infant. The second we were a party of four adults and 4 kids. Botha times they were able to seat us immediately and comfortably. Hubby and I were happy to have a two too where our stroller could sit next to us without being in anyone's way. When we returned with friends we were happy to be seated on the patio where the kids had space to roam and there was some kind of game table set up. Not to mention a beautiful view of the water and the strip.   Both times we just went for milk shakes. While my experience at a Black Tap in New York had very slow service (pretty sure we waited at least 25 minutes for just two milk shakes), this place got them out in no time!   Their current special Shake was a Churro Shake. We loved it so much the first time that we got it again on the second night. I thought that over all, this milkshake simply had the boldest and most delicious flavor. But the Cinnamon Toast Crunch on the outside of the glass didn't hurt! Not to mentioned the ice cream soaked churros stuck on top!! Mmmm!  On the first night we got the salty and sweet. This peanut butter milkshake didn't taste quite as flavorful as the Churro. But I was happy to eat all of the m&m's off the side along with the Reese's and pretzel sticks. Lol.   The next night, we ordered the salty and sweet but asked the the milkshake he fruity pebbles instead of peanut butter. Yup. Weird combo. Lol. If you super love Fruit my Pebbles, this is the milkshake for you. My husband loved it.   Over all, this is a great place to get a crazy topped milkshake. The milkshakes themselves are nothing different from anywhere else. But the service was great and accommodations were even better. We're happy campers!",

    "text": "If I only counted my first experience at Black Tap, the restaurant would be a solid three. Just another over-hyped, over-priced burger joint in Vegas with bad pickles and a \"crazy shake\" on the menu to draw in the tourists with their kids. Nothing exceptional, but not the worst place I've ever eaten. Unfortunately, in the Vegas spirit, I pressed my luck and tried it again.   Admittedly it was approaching closing time when we arrived at 11:30pm-ish on a Sunday for a couple of milkshakes. Sure enough, as soon as we got close, I could see the \"Sorry We're Closed\" sign complete with rope and bollards and a handful of people still finishing their meal inside the restaurant.  I worked in food service before, and I respect the \"no seating tables 30 minutes before closing time\" rule that some restaurants seem to follow.  I chalked it up to bad timing on my part and headed back to the hotel, thinking I'd try again tomorrow on my way back from the show at the RIO.   As soon as the show was over, we ran to catch an Uber, rushed back to the hotel and began the hike to the black tap. We had the Black Tap in our sights by 11:00 pm a full hour before they are scheduled to close. A schedule, that I confirmed with the waitress at the restaurant, the concierge at the Venetian, and the checkout desk at the Palazzo.  Sure enough, there were the rope and bollards, and the \"Sorry We're Closed\" sign a full hour ahead of the time they list on every web page, menu, etc. that they close. I went to the hostess and asked her what the deal was, and she claimed that from time to time they would close early if business was slow. I might've believed her if she wasn't standing in front of a restaurant still crawling with people. Then she claimed the milkshake machine was blocked off. So no shakes could be made anyway. I left frustrated.   This restaurant suffers from poor or judging by the other reviews inconsistent management. If the terrible pickles (and I mean the worst I've ever had - how do you screw up a pickle?) didn't give it away, the closing AN HOUR BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TIME certainly did. What manager in their right mind closes an hour early and in Vegas of all places?     The next morning when we were checking out, I mentioned this incident to the desk clerk at the Pallazzo, and he said, without missing a beat \"Oh you should have tried Holsteins Shakes and Buns in the Cosmopolitan, way better than the Black Tap.\"   Next time I'm in Vegas I think I'll take that advice and I'd recommend you do the same.  PS. About these pickles, I want you to imagine one of those conversion vans from the 80-90s that had plush carpet in the back. Imagine you bought one of those with about 200k miles on it, that had been used to ferry kids animals and lumber around for the last 30 years with only the occasional spot vacuuming. Now imagine cutting a small piece of fabric from that carpet and eating it. This is the best approximation for what their pickles taste like.   Also, their onion rings are too thick, but at this point, that's just splitting hairs.",

We arrived around 9pm on Sunday. The line for a table was long so we sat at the bar. The bar staff was amazing. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered the cake shake.  Ice cream +cake. What could be better? I have a huge sweet tooth and that combination is my favorite. And then I saw it. The shake matched every picture description I read from other yelpers. It was almost  as if slow motion had taken over. It was placed in front of me and the heavens opened.   I took my first sip of the shake. Hmm. Not what I thought. I'll try another. Nope. Still a strange flavor and temperature combo. It was thick like a milk shake but it wasn't cold. It was room temperature.  I kept sipping because I didn't get cake batter flavor. After 6 or 7 taste tests, I gave up and moved onto the cake.   I love cake! Add sprinkles and it's a party! I pushed my spoon through the layers and ... my spoon got stuck. The middle layer of icing was too cold to get through. Nearly frozen. I gave it a minute to come to room temperature and took a few bites. The actual cake was delicious. The icing to cake ratio was 4:1. Too much for me.   The combination of room temperature, non flavored shake and nearly frozen cake was a huge disappointment. Sadly, I'll  stick with shake shack and no cake",

This is one of the only places that knows how to cook them. All the other plcaes I have gone to have such oily pickles but this place did not. It was just the right amount of salt as well. High recommend the pickles if you like pickles. So we got two different burgers and the one that I had was the steak au (insert rest of name here lol) and that ws to die for. The burger was cooked to perfection and the dipping sauce on the side was wonderful addition to the burger and wow just sitting here my mouth is watering. My friends got the truffle burger and although I didnt taste it my friends said it was amazing as well. So on to dessert we ordered the cookie milk shake and I am usually not such a big fan of sweets but I love it. Highly recommend to come here on your next trip",

    "text": "Absolute favorite new spot in Vegas - it's my first and last stop now every time I'm in town. A food and beer lovers paradise. The design of the place is very vibrant, stylish but fun, a lot of room but feels intimate. Music is always on point - from the best classic rock to 80s/90s era hip hop for a fun and familiar vibe. Craft beer list feels chosen by people who really care and love great and creative beers. The food -- all of it, from burgers to appetizers to the crazy shakes - are of a way way higher quality and level of execution than you'd expect from a typical burger place and huge value for the quality of ingredients and service. So far every burger I've ever had here is cooked to perfect temperature, meat is super flavorful on the right kind of soft yet grilled bun that contrasts the char and bite to the burger. Between the all American, the \"Greg Norman\", the Texan etc etc - always impossible to choose. Perfect wings and crispy chicken sandwich with Korean flavors. And I'm not a dessert guy but the shakes are out of control - very hard to resist.  Love this place, and love places that create an experience that far surpasses what you typically get from a burger spot.",

The server himself was extremely rude- tried grabbing the credit card right out of one of our friend's hands without waiting for her to give it to him. And when asked questions about items on the menu- sighed and rolled his eyes and asked us what we meant. Was never told a check could only be split 3 ways and was never asked how to split the checks. He took well over 30 minutes to figure out how to split the checks and still did it wrong. We didn't even order drinks. Food had little to no taste. Our milkshake came and looked amazing - we asked for several spoons so that we could share - only to come and find out our spoon was buried under all the toppings INSIDE the milkshake. I would avoid this restaurant and would NEVER recommend to anyone. The manager at the time told us to give him time to work out the checks and he was having a bad day because his grandmother was in the hospital. If I were the manager I would have sent this server home if it was affecting his performance this much. A large party sat down beside us and were commenting on how they had not been served after sitting there while our server was busy splitting our checks (30+minutes). As our server dropped our checks off he included to inform them that checks could only be split 3 ways as he already had to deal with our mess right in front of us. Mind you, he told us that any party over 6 or more is 18% automatic gratuity and none of it goes to him- all the house staff. Not sure how much that is True. There are many more places to eat in Vegas and I would avoid this place at all cost unless you are looking for disappointment. Rude staff all around.",

I waited 15 minutes for them to make the shake and when it got to me it was already melting. The presentation looked nice (aside from the melting ice cream dripping off the cup) but the way it's assembled makes it impossible to eat. Half the shake was whipped cream, the other half was a mixture of peanut butter cups, m&ms, PB chocolate pretzels, a completely frozen and inedible lady taffy (with the wrapper still on) and completely melted ice cream. Any child can go to the supermarket, buy these ingredients and make it themselves in a matter of minutes. If they charged $5 for this milkshake like most places do I still think it's amongst the worst I've had but I wouldn't complain. The only positive thing I have to say is the customer service was very good and they didn't charge me for it. The food did look good though so I'll leave it with 3 stars until I try the food.",

    "text": "So I really wanted to love the place based off all the buzz , pictures, ambiance, and the price of food whic is not cheap.....  So the ambiance is perfect for a friends get together to have some drinks and just relax, the decor is super hip and they play great music and all the employees are really laid back and in great moods so everything is working together perfectly. After sitting down and feeling the vibe I was ready to order and take on this whole experience, and then reality kinda set in......  I ordered a wagu beef Texan burger and a queso cheese dip which I was expecting to be off the charts based on everything I was seeing , so the first thing is they only make their beef, rare, medium rare, or well done. I prefer my burger medium well and they told me they wouldn't do that which makes me a little sad so I choose the medium rare . So the presentation of the burgers are very nice , however, there was nothing special about the taste, the bun was soggy and I couldn't tell that I had a premium that I was paying extra for. I'm not saying he burger was bad but it definitely didn't live up to a $25 price tag and the burger was pretty small. Next was the queso dip and it was average at best, it tasted like it was opened from a sams club can and I didn't even bother taking more than a couple bites .  The thing that saves this restaurant is the atmosphere and the people that work there. I will say that the shakes look amazing and it's the only reason I would try black tap again and I may have to update at a later date. I really struggled on a 3 or 4 star but the vibe and people could not overcome the lack of taste and high price tag you will pay along with the smaller size portions",

Seen other tables ordered the crazy shake looked so delicious but didn't try it this time so will update for the next time we'll go back...lol ;)",

    "text": "Over the past three years I've tried three separate times to go to Black Tap in New York City only to find that the line is well in excess of two hours. With that in mind, you can imagine how excited I was to finally get a taste of Black Tap in Vegas. In short, surely the real thing is better than this imposter, because my experience at Black Tap was nothing short of mediocre.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  I feel for the servers at Black Tap I really do. They're having to churn party after party of customers with ages ranging from 2 to 102 all day and well into the evening with little reprieve, and that stress shows. By the time my girlfriend and I arrived at Black Tap around 9P, they were out of most beers, a shake or two, and the place was an absolute mess from what appeared to be a child's birthday party. Fortunately, our food came out quickly, so I really can't complain. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Black Tap is, plain and simple, expensive, but it's not to the point where I'm docking stars. This is Vegas, and I'll admit that the portions were massive before complaining about my $15.00 shake and my $20.00 burger and fries. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  So it's here that everything fell apart. My burger, fries, and onion rings were all weak, with a burger that relied heavily upon mediocre toppings for flavor, fries that were limp and devoid of flavor, and a Bam Bam Shake that was more optics than anything else. No Stars.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I'll still try to track down a visit to the original NYC location, but I'll skip the Vegas rendition going forward. No Star.",

    "text": "Black tap has the best music in town! I loved hearing the Beastie Boys, \"retro\" Eminem and other old school music while we ate. The atmosphere is hip and there's plenty of cool photo opportunities.   Pros -  The shakes are literally a meal in themselves -- and all I could eat was my Birthday Cake Shake --- complete with a huge slice of cake on top! They're beautiful and absolutely delicious!! My kids ordered fried cheese, chips and some fries in addition to their shakes. They enjoyed their food, and had no complaints.  My oldest daughter had the Cookie Shake and the younger one ordered the Cotton Candy Shake. They LOVED them!!  Cons- They don't take reservations, and personally I think that's unfortunate. It's first come, first serve. Normally, that wouldn't be such a downer --- but the line for Black Tap is directly across from the Sport Book and my eyes were really bugging me from all the cigar and cigarette smoke emanating from the Sports Book area. Another thing I didn't like is the minuscule water glasses you get at your table. Sure, they give you a larger bottle to refill your water with, but the glass is like the size of a large shot glass. Not too practical when in Vegas where it's super dry and hot. In addition, the water was room temperature and there was no ice. Its Vegas - we need cold water.....   Overall, it was a great vibe and delicious food. We will definitely return, but I wish they took reservations!!!!",

For locals, the CrazyShakes are definitely worth the trip to the Strip.   Black Tap serves up the most imaginative shakes in all of Las Vegas. I know this because I've tried them all: Holsteins, Shake Shack, Flippin' Good Burgers, and Steak n Shake - just to name a few. I wanted to be a little adventurous, so here's what CrazyShakes we ordered:   Bam Bam (A) Fruity Pebbles Shake with Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispy Treats, Laffy Taffy, and a strawberry PopTart   Sweet n Salty (B+) Peanut Butter shake, chocolate-peanut butter rimmed with M&Ms, mini PB cups, and a pretzel rod drizzled in chocolate  Cookies and Cream Supreme (A+) Oreo Shake vanilla frosted rimmed with crushed Oreos, topped with a 'cookies 'n cream' ice cream sandwich, and crumbled Oreos  The servers are all extremely friendly and attentive.  And be sure to request a seat on their patio (unless it's during summer months).",

Located inside of the Venetian Hotel, Black Tap has a 80s-90s vibe with some old skool, music playing in the background. The art work takes you back to this wonderful era and nostalgia rushes in like a cloud of smoke.   It wasn't the food I came here for, but for their shakes. If you had one look at these babies, you'd agree and know who the star of the show was. I was fortunate enough to try the Cookie Shake which included my shake, whole cookie pieces and a scoop of ice cream underneath a pillowy cloud of whipped cream, topped with chocolate drizzle. This is my kind of shake.  It looks super good and makes for a great yelp foodie pick, but they're just as great in taste.  It's worth it's weight in gold.   Service starts off with your shake. It's the main attraction anyways lol. You'll definitely enjoy it. On this day, I ordered their Korean wings, which I added some fries to go with that. This came out shortly after my shake. Service was efficient and relaxed. Wish there was more to try, but when I'm back in town and at the Venetian, I'm coming back for more!     Definitely a must do, is check out their shakes. You'll be glad you did!",

I had the Mexico City burger and it was flavorful. My girlfriend had the Bison burger, which she seemed to like as well. Her sister had the Wagyu burger salad, which she thought was tasty. Overall, food was excellent.  We went on a Friday night, so the atmosphere was very lively. We happened to get seated promptly, but the line was not far behind. I would highly recommend making a reservation. The restaurant is smaller, but it adds to the energetic environment.   We will be back! Highly recommend.",

The decor was super cute and pic worthy.  I ordered an all American burger and a crazy shake I'm not sure of the name but it had churros, a Choco taco and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I believe the milkshake flavor was some cinnamon concoction - I thought that would be too much cinnamon so I elected to have an actual strawberry milkshake and just eat the toppings off separately. My burger was delicious and cooked perfectly - the shake was a lot I recommend sharing one with two or three people I took it to go but I never finished it.  The manager stopped to check if I was enjoying my meal that is always nice. Great experience I look forward to returning.",

Both of us being into fitness, this is the perfect place to go for your cheat meals! We waited months to have the burgers and milkshakes. We are already planning our next trip to Vegas and have been talking about how we would be perfectly satisfied with just going to blacktop alone for every meal!!!! It's THAT good",

Music is loud, the tables are very close together so the patrons seem loud, and our waitress was yelling at us over the music to get our orders. Everything on the table had a very \"sticky\" feel to it.   We tried the churro and Bam Ban shakes, a chili cheese burger, and an all-American. The shakes are insane. So much sugary goodness. Almost too much. I definitely had a bit of sugar shock from my fruity pebbles shake (but the best part is the bottom as your ice cream melts - holy smokes!). The boys shared the churro shake and really enjoyed the choco taco! The churros were a bit stale, so they didn't eat much of those.   Burgers were basic. Nothing super exciting. The ketchup was nasty and the lid / top of the bottle were gooey. Hubby and nephew enjoyed the fries tho!   Overall, worth trying once for the novelty of it, but for the price, I think there are better options that don't leave you feeling like you're going into a sugar coma!",

I read about the long lines but thankfully we came shortly after they opened so we were seated right away.  The menu was overwhelming for me because I wanted to order everything.   I forgot what Ronnie ordered but I ordered the Texan and asked for it rare and a Brooklyn Blackout... in the end I had some fries, half of my burger, and only 1/4 of my milkshake.  I deserved a medal for it because I could have inhaled everything but I was practicing self control.     Our order did not take long... the shake came out first and then the burgers.  I cut my burger in half and was so surprised to see it was prepared rare like I asked.  The burger was juicy!  The milkshake was OK; not super creamy but it was rich nonetheless.  I really liked the brownie touch on each side but I only had one.. it was soft and chewy!    Friendly service.  Our server was super sweet.",

With sweet potatoe fries and a thirst quenching good old beer!    But let me tell you about our server, man was he great!! (Sorry, didnt get his name) but me, although being the last one there, he sure treated me with the upmost courtesy and genuine service.  He made sure I was well taken care of and even offered to heat up my food since it had been sitting for a bit, that's going beyond expectation.. he surely deserves my kuddos!

We had the Pizza, Mexico, and Bison burgers... all were pretty good, but the milkshakes we had for dessert hit the spot to end a solid burger meal.  Wait was about 20 mins, and the place was bigger than you think.  You can wait for a table, or have almost immediate seating if you don't mind sitting at the bar.    The chefs cooked our burgers perfectly as requested, and they offer different fries depending on your preference for $2 more.  Only knock I had was the onion rings were a bit undercooked.  But overall, it was def a must experience for the crazy milkshakes.    The shakes are a must share with someone unless that's all you're getting.  The average cost is about $15-17 per shake, but the decadent flavors and presentation make it worth the squeeze.     A must add to your food bucket list... enjoy!",

    "text": "I'm \"that\" person, that dessert person. The one who goes somewhere and is like what's the best dessert in town? Well Vegas hasn't had a ton of new places I've needed to try until now. I somehow stumbled upon pics of these milkshakes and knew I had to have one. I don't generally do milk or dairy but I'm known to make exceptions for shakes that look like these.  I told myself I'd have one for brekke because well ummm I'm an adult and adults can do that! So... I woke up early, hit the gym at Canyon Ranch then wandered over for my shake.  Service was fine enough, after playing a game of musical chairs. I'm always a bit picky about where I sit in a restaurant and I wanted to sit in a certain place they were expecting a large party for so after a couple of rotations I ended up where I did and ordered the Bam Bam.  Sooooo tasty! This may be the sort of shake you only really need once in your life, maybe twice! It's pretty massive but SO MUCH FUN!!! Fruity pebbles rice krispy treat (which is probably hands down my most fav way to make rice krispy treats because fruity pebble versions are just sooo much better! this is a fact, if you disagree we can't be friends) and a poptart (Ummmmm hello!!! a freaken Pop Tart on my shake, gimme gimme gimme - see literally brekke!) AND a strawberry laffy taffy (yummmmmmmmm!!!! Who knew I loved laffy taffy sticks as much as I do? So good!)  I scraped every last bit of frosting or whatever it was holding the fruity pebbles onto the side of the glass off, and really enjoyed my shake. I'm not so big on whip cream so when some fell off right from the start it wasn't a big deal.  This is a super messy treat, at least it was for me. I felt like one of those 2 year olds with a massive mess, sticky fingers, needing like 100 napkins but in the end left completely satisfied with my new Vegas destination dessert item.  The menu itself did nothing for me. I'm not much into this sort of food, so I'd say come for the milkshakes. It's seriously a meal in itself!",

    "text": "TLDR: good burgers and milkshakes. The food is just TOO heavy and greasy for me.  I came to Black Tap because one of my best friends decided to have her birthday dinner here. We were all intrigued by pictures of the shakes and the gourmet burgers so we made the trek to the Venetian. The restaurant is located inside the Venetian hotel!  Upon arriving at the restaurant there was no wait for a table which was super nice. We were immediately seated and we proceeded to order our food.   I decided to split food with a friend so that we could have more variety of flavors. I went with the truffle burger and a side of fries while my friend ordered the Texan burger with a side of onion rings ($2 more for substitution). In addition to the burgers, we ordered the Oreo shake as well as the churro shake.   The burgers were perfectly cooked and super juicy! The bread was buttery and soft. Out of the two burger flavors I tried, I actually preferred the taste of the Texan burger. Although the burgers were delicious, I could only eat half of one because of the greasiness! My stomach was literally churning afterwards from the mixture of grease and milk in the milkshake.   As for the milkshakes, I loved the presentation. They are beautiful milkshakes and are overflowing with toppings. The churro milkshake was topped with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, a Choco taco and actual churros. Both shakes were delicious and I highly recommend getting one to share at your table! They are truly an experience.",

We sat at the patio area which was nice because you can people watch and enjoy the night life of Las Vegas. And see some wild things.   The Bison Burger was ok nothing that special. Not much I can say about it.   The Oreo sundae ice cream sandwich is the star in the cup. As for what's inside tasted good and sweet. Something I shared with the table.   The front you can see then making the crazy ice cream sundaes through a clear glass. And the service is average. Sometimes there's a line so be early.",

    "text": "Wow!  This place is awesome - you will not want for food when you leave - I can tell you that.   For just me, with water, no appetizer, a burger with salad (add avocado) and one of their famous cake shakes, I spent about $56.  So it's not cheap at all, but it is Vegas and it is good.   We arrived on July 4th at around 5pm for dinner and were quickly seated on the outside patio (it was HOT) under the misting fans and an umbrella.  There was no line and there were plenty of spots inside as well if we had wanted.  The menu is mostly burgers but they have a ton of burger choices, appetizers, and salads which are topped with burgers or another protein like chicken.    My friend chose the signature Black Tap Burger Salad and she mentioned her soy/carrot allergy and they did a very good job of answering her questions and assuring her they would cook her food separately on another grill.    I chose the Mexico City Burger with Jalapenos, a spicy cheese, spicy aioli, onions and lettuce, pickle and tomato on the side.  It was very good.  I also had a small side salad for an uncharge and it was very good as well.   We knew we were going to get some shakes before we even came so, although the entrees filled us up, we each ordered a shake.  I went with the holiday special, a 4th of July Freedom Cake Shake - a vanilla shake with a red, white and blue cake slice and sprinkles.  My friend chose the Churro Chaco Taco Shake which was ridiculous!  It had a full-sized Chaco Taco, two churros stuffed in a cinnamon toast crunch shake with a glass rimmed with vanilla icing with cinnamon toast crunch rimming it.  Delicious.    We felt so awful leaving - but it was a fun experience and we had good service and the food was out quickly with no issues.   A great place to stop in if you are in Vegas - it's easy to find and overlooks the water at the Venetian on the ground level.",

It wasn't too hot yet around noon but there were flies that hovered when the food arrived - apparently its a known problem but not much they can do  Ordered: 1. mushroom burger - excellent burger with good flavor / fries were below average 2. korean chicken wings - omg they were surprisingly very good with the sweet sauce and not spicy at all / I didn't order them but I ate more than they did lol 3. confetti cake milk shake - my idea and it was a bad one / for how much it costs (15-20$), there's no expectations for the cake but the milkshake itself was very watery  - it was almost like I was in chemistry class all over again and was making home made ice cream..no go for me and I'd recommend Holstein's at Cosmo if you want a good shake on the Strip  The burgers here are really good but stick to the inside tables and save dessert for somewhere else.

I also tried the Brooklyn Blackout shake and that was insanely tasty! It was like tasting a chocolate mousse!  The vibe here is super chill. The art everywhere gives me an urban vibe that makes everything else in this place chill. You can definitely tell this place came from NYC! Their artwork on the walls are abstract, just like everything in here.   10/10 would highly recommend to anyone!",

It looked great, had the extreme extra toppings, but it wasn't fantastic tasting. The server asked if we wanted any type of booze in the shake - bailey's, vodka - and we hesitated but said sure, we'll do bailey's because it kind of goes with ice cream? I think the milkshake would have tasted much better without it. It wasn't very strong but it has a strong presence in the drink. I'd probably come back and try something again.",

The BIG \"Blue Bunny\" ice cream \"Oreo\" sandwich was the highlight of the entire shake!

What i got was, a burger so big, the first 7 bites were just plain ground beef. So much meat, that i literally gagged. All my toppings and flavor were hidden in a fried onion ring on top and i had to eat half the burger to get to the flavor. And honestly i was so disgusted by the endless amout of flavorless meat. I just boxed it up and gave it to my hubby. The fries, are so boring and flavorless. Basic frozen French fries. The turkey burger was delicious. Had some guacamole on top i believe, it was great.  The birthday cake milkshake was just a piece of cake on top of a disgusting cake batter flavored milk shake.  Cool photo op place.  Location is super hard to find. Food was flavorless and over priced. I'm a local and will probably never be back. Much better burger fries and milkshakes on the strip.",

We got the peanut butter shake and it was so much peanut butter. Peanut butter inside the cup with vanilla ice cream, peanut butter cups, peanut butter pieces, and a sugar daddy. The only thing not peanut butter were the pretzel sticks. Over the top but one of those things you need to try at least once in your Vegas experience.",

The first time we came here the bar was empty and instead of offering to have us grab a drink while we wait for a table the hostess pointed to where we must stand in line in order to wait for a table- horrible, horrible customer service.  The second time I came here there was an excruciatingly long line and there was a hostess walking down with a note pad writing down the number in each party. When she got to us, we advised her we were a party of 2 and asked for the wait and she rudely responded 35 minutes- to which we of course asked if she could take our name down and text/ call us when the table was prepared (who wants to stand in the corner of a casino waiting in line for a half hour??!!!)  but the answer was no because FIRST COME FIRST SERVE no call ahead no reservations nothing.  Their wait system is completely irrational especially for a restaurant in the middle of a busy casino. Hostesses are rude. And the line they make you wait in is just absurd. Highly disappointed in this place.",

    "text": "I went to Vegas this past weekend with an intent to eat my way through the strip, and it was very successful trip. Black Tap was my last destination, and I was very satisfied with my finale choice. We were planning to go for dinner the night before we actually went, and I was planning to have the Brussels sprouts and Korean BBQ wings, but we ended up enjoying pizza at midnight instead. So for lunch I ordered the BBQ burger (I forget what it's called but it has bacon and an onion ring). It was SO good. I'll first say that I have been majority vegetarian/vegan for the past year and this weekend I wanted to not have to limit myself so I enjoyed all the animals with as much gratitude as humanly possible.  My boyfriend got the Truffle Burger, and it was delightfully rich, but not overly so. The fries were cooked perfectly - crispy outside, soft inside - but they weren't really salty enough for my taste (boyfriend liked them). Then of course we HAD to get a shake. The milkshake bar is like what I imagine they have in Heaven's cafeteria. I wanted the Bam Bam because it included a pop-tart, the most perfect snack. It was a feast for the eyes; frosting holding onto a full-coverage sprinkle of fruity pebbles, a high pile of whip cream with more fruit pebbles, all decorated with a stick of laffy taffy, rice crispy treat (more fruity pebbles), and half a strawberry pop-tart. While it was delicious, I have to say it presented better than it tasted. I think I would have preferred if it was ice cream in it's natural state instead of blended because I like to eat everything with a spoon. And the fruity pebbles on the frosting were a little stale, but the ones on the whip cream were fresh, which seemed strange.  This was a really long review... Anyway, I liked Black Tap and will recommend it to my burger-loving friends. And I will be back to try the Brussels and wings! ...And probably the chocolate brownie shake option...",

The mozzarella triangles were extremely greasy and tasted like old oil. The onion rings left much to be desired and the burgers were BLAND. Like they didn't even use salt and pepper at the very least. We spent over $100 for 4 people for this unsatisfying dinner and would've been far more pleased at In N Out. The 2nd star is for the fact that they kindly made a grilled cheese sandwich for my 2 year old which isn't on the menu (she enjoyed it). We also had the cake shake. The shake itself is pretty good but the cake slice is DRY. Overall, I'd probably recommend this place to an enemy, definitely not a friend.",

Great music choice/playlist going, but I wasn't a big fan of it being so loud, I could barely have a conversation.  Initially, we came in for one of their famous signature shakes, but we actually ended up deciding to get food. I ordered the Californian with a black bean patty, and omg, it was ahhhmazing. There's just something about that truffle mayo that made it 10x more better.   Ended our dinner with the Cake Shake -- to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of that either. The presentation was great, but it was just too much going on and too sweet. I think I got diabetes from just looking at it. I mean, if you've got a sweet tooth, by all means, go for it.  A bit pricey, but that was expected considering the fact that it's located in one of the casinos on the Strip. The portions are fairly decent sized, so I'll give them that. Overall, great presentation and delicious food!",

I like my burgers cooked mostly all the way but it still had plenty of flavor. The onion rings were gigantic! And paired nicely w the dill buttermilk sauce. And the shake was as amazing tasting as it looks! The portions were huge we shared everything and still ended up super stuffed. We sat outside on the patio which is right at the end of the canal in the ventian. Beautiful view and our service was perfect! It made for a really fun date night!",

We ordered the chips and dip and a falafel burger, which was amazballs.  The blood orange IPA was one of the best beers the boyfriend claims to have had (and we've tried a few) and my mimosa was in point!  Bree and Sean behind the bar were excellent and we enjoyed all their recommendations.  If you're in the area, this place is fun. They have good food and Bree and Sean will keep the drinks flowing!",

Would recommend the regular fries over the sweet potatoe fries and fried pickles to start off. Sad to find out they don't sing \"Happy Birthday\" however, they will place a candle on the shake when they bring it out.  Prices are resonable considering this is a Las Vegas Strip joint. Our bill was $158 for 1 appetizer, 4 meals, 2 beers, 4 regular drinks and 2 shakes.",

In Vegas for a conference and finding they opened in Venetian Palazzo was too good to be True. I would finally try it! Well, I could have lived without it. We shared a shake and order of fries. No wait. Sat at the counter. The shake was one of the over the top ones, Oreo. Shake itself was big but nothing special. Tons of whipped cream and sugary crap on top, far less actual shake than you would expect. Cookie caked all around the rim that you can't even eat. Not impressed and made me feel sick. Waste of calories. Fries were so so. People next to us had burgers and I saw no reason to try one. Only giving two stars because the service was attentive and fast.",

    "text": "Well I was very, very excited to try these wonderful CrazyShakes that I kept seeing Facebook ads for. Unfortunately on a recent trip for dessert for my birthday back on March 30th we had such a horrendous experience with service that I couldn't even bear to leave 2 stars. I waited quite a while before writing the review to let myself cool off after how mad we all were thinking I cold write a more generous review because the shakes were quite spectacular, but that is not the case, I still feel the same several weeks later!  Since it was a Friday night we expected there to be a long line. There was NO line and the restaurant seemed only about half full table wise around 8pm. There were 3 girls at the hostess stand all furiously chatting away about their personal lives. One of our party of 4 walked up and said 4 please. She replied with hold on, goes and looks at the tables I assume and comes back and grumpily says follow me, seated us in a booth directly behind the center bar where the shakes are made, dumps our menus and takes off quickly.   Our server Luis came promptly over to our table upon being seated so THAT part I give him credit for. He offered water, we accepted and promptly ordered 4 milkshakes and I myself ordered fries to have a salty snack knowing the sugar overload that was headed my way. Everything after was a nightmare......  We waited about 20 minutes. Still no Luis, still no fries. I was worried the fries would come out before the shakes. Luis was over next to the server's computers standing with several other servers chatting away. During this time of waiting a group of 4 guys who were clearly tourists and VERY loud and drunk sitting in the booth next to us managed to drunkenly flail their arms and knock one of the mason jars holding straws off their table and it smashed on the ground and the shards of glass went flying like bullets. I had open toe shoes and had pieces to shake off my foot and the guys in our group shook them off the creases in the bottom legs of their pants. I looked around and a few servers were whizzing by as it happened (clearly they could hear it), the servers talking by the computers could hear, the couple kids behind the shake bar were standing at the back and I'm sure they could hear too. Nobody even so much as GLANCED in the direction that worked there, only the couple other tables of guests in the area looked over and watched. The guys as drunk as they were even looked around bewildered. Nobody ever came over to clean up the glass or ask what happened.   So still waiting on shakes we had sipped all the water away. Suddenly some young girl came whizzing over and set our 4 shakes on the table without a word and runs off. I'm looking around at this point, still no Luis, still no fries. We ate our shakes fairly quickly (about 15 minutes) and then sat. And sat and sat. At this point I'm losing all patience. The sugar overload was killing me, I was craving both water and salt, of which I had none. We waited over HALF AN HOUR with empty shakes and glasses just staring at ceiling. Luis for the majority of this time had been standing by the computers yakking away with the other servers who all spent a half hour doing NOTHING. I finally kept turning around and still staring them down in disbelief. He must have finally gotten the clue because he comes over and in a walk by fashion without stopping moving his feet says super chipper and happy \"are you guys all set anything else I can get you? Ok I'll be your cashier when your ready\". Drops the check and beelines back to registers to talk. We didn't even have a chance to answer if we wanted anything else or to tell him of the problems (like my missing fries, the freaking glass in my shoes, the empty water glasses the fact that he never ONCE in an hour came back from point of taking our order in a time that spanned an hour to an hour and a half). At this point I didn't even want to tell him what was wrong because there would have been a string of expletives involved that I felt inappropriate at the time.    We paid and left a $5 tip. I have NEVER in my life even with somewhat poor service cut a tip short. I work in the industry & my spouse and I have a rule....any time we eat out (we eat out a LOT) for any of our small checks that are $20-$60 which is our usual tab we leave $20 tip. Could be a $20 IHop check, we leave $20. As we left and passed by the hostess stand near 9:30 the same girls were standing there bitching about their lives to each other still. I tried to make eye contact to say thank you but nothing. No bye, thank you for coming, nothing. Just totally involved in facebook, boyfriends and god knows what else. So unprofessional it's disgusting. I said screw it at this point and stormed off into the casino.   I have NEVER had such awful unprofessional experience in my life!! Sucks because the shakes were so fun! Management needs to do something about their staff here!!",

Service was great, our server was really helpful since I am the worst decision maker when there are so many yummy things on the menu. We got 3 milkshakes that were all so good! Just beware that they are huge and pretty expensive. Their burgers were really good, I had to pace myself in order to enjoy it along with the shake. We got the cookies & cream, sweet and sour (?), and birthday cake (?) shakes. I got their classic burger with a fried egg added & my boyfriend got the Mexico City burger.",

From the moment we walked in the atmosphere was perfect! Smiling, happy, & warm greeters & servers, great old school hip hop & a vibe that was energetic & family friendly.   We weren't really hungry, we were there primarily for the shakes, but ordered food anyway. Glad we did... the food was delicious! Highly recommend the teriyaki broccoli & wings.   And, of course, the shakes... THE SHAKES! If for pictures & posting purposes alone... so well worth it! Lol! Thank goodness they were really good to boot.   The only thing I thought peculiar were the teeny tiny water glasses, but the staff was on it... our glasses were never empty.   Such a great overall experience... My husband even commented, \"I want a place just like this.\"   I wanted to leave a review as soon as I got back to the hotel but it being their first day of operations & all they didn't have a Yelp page yet. So, here you go! We will DEFINITELY be back!",

I ordered a Californian and told them I needed a dry bun and no cheese because I have a severe dairy allergy. Instead of addressing it before the food came out, they addressed it at service before I could change my order. I was served a bunless burger because THEIR BUNS AREN'T VEGAN. So just be warned vegans. Just in case. And they don't really seem to care about food safety.",

The restaurant environment is actually cool; we sat in this funky yet cool little booth. The waiter was pretty nice as well.  The food looks better than what it really is, the burgers were ok but not worth the almost 20 bucks, not a lot of flavor. Having that said, I was really excited for the shakes which seem to be the main \"attraction\" I tried the cotton candy one and it was pretty ok",

    "text": "Right on the outter parts of the Venetian, this is very comparable to Holsteins inside the Cosmo. This place has good burgers and fries, and of course milk shakes. The waitress recommended we split a burger if we each planned on getting our own shake, good call!! Shouldn't have gotten the chips and queso, it was just so so but we were too hungry. We ended up getting the Greg Norman, wagyu beef, blue cheese and arugula. It comes w fries and runs about $20. Milk shakes are why people come here, to get a pic for the instabook and snapface. They run about $15 but are like 3 desserts in one, guess the difference between this and Holsteins is that these don't come w alcohol. These shakes are better in my opinion!!! We ended up w the cookie one and the birthday cake one. I really liked both, we couldn't finish both though!! Burger places on the strip will get you though. This meal will run you $75!!!! Not value town, but in line with other Vegas places on the strip. Worth a visit for sure. I'll be back one day.",

Instead, I was able to get a seat at the bar right away. My server stopped by quickly and offered me a sample of several beers, to ensure I would like what I ultimately ordered. Thanks to the sample, I found a great local lager that was light and easy to drink.  Then it was time to choose a burger. There are at least a dozen unique, all prime beef choices and I was torn so I asked my server what was best. He gave me two great options and I finally made my decision. The classic all-American bacon cheeseburger. It was juicy and delicious. The fries were perfectly golden brown. I was impressed.  Prices are high, but it's a casino restaurant in Vegas, so I expected as much. Three beers and two burgers with sides ran about $80 with tip.",

Wifes mom went in 30 minutes early, 3 very rude, very \"who gives a f*ck\" hostess, said naw, everyone has to be here.  So we have drinks at the bar, 30 minutes later 11 out of 12 are here, the 12 is walking the casino trying to find the place.  I tell the 3 hostess, (who are busy gossiping) we have 11 out of 12, the 12 is literally 2 minutes away walking.  AGAIN, while obviously annoyed, tell us when she gets here. IT IS 8:00PM WED prime time dinner in a nice casino.  Last friend gets here, i tell her WE ARE ALL HERE.  She seems annoyed and scrambling around looking for tables.  Another 10 minutes.  Finally get going, takes us to 3 BOOTHS, she like, \"sorry, its all we got open.\"  So after multiple attempts to let them know ahead they still dont give 2 sh*ts.  My friend sees AN OPEN SIDE ROOM SPECIFICALLY FOR LARGE PARTIES being cleared.  Asked the waitress, can we sit in here?  \"NO THATS CLOSED NOW\".  so we are sitting around for another 10 or 15 minutes deciding if its even worth it with this incredibly rude hostessez and waitress, when the GM, John steps in.  We ask him why we cant be moved, he said \"No problem!\"  Literally saved the day.  Brought in a different server, missed hiz name but buff white guy,  super nice, friendly, professional and efficient.     Food is great, shakes are awesome. Service was fast and great.  John the manager checked in often, even offered to cut our bday cake for us!  He was incredible.  Made what originally was a horrible experience amazing.  The hostesses up front are rude, patronizing and more interested in gossiping instead of customers, the waitress who told us basically to screw off and not bother her with a large birthday party sucked, and need ti be retrained.   But manager John and the fit white waiter was amazing and really exemplified customer service and great experience.  If your going for a quick bite, sure, but if your a large party wanting to celebrate there, FORGET IT.    *side note, 9 out of 12 all work in the service industry. We arent that picky and understand busy nights, but this was ridicous.",

On the gluten-free side, the server went to check with the chef for what could be done for me, which I appreciated. Follow up was timely.  Minus: when the burger came out, it came out with french fries on the plate, not from a dedicated fryer. I should've sent it back, but I figured I would just give it a try and move the french fries away from the Burger. As anyone with celiac disease knows, that is a no-no, and I ended up getting a dosed as a result.",

Spend your money and time at the hundreds of really quality restaurants in Las Vegas. Bypass this Blacktap",

You're gonna pay a little more for this place, but it's completely worth it!  Skip the 30-50 min. Line and sit at the bar.  My only serious issue with Black Tap is the complete lack of a kids menu and or flexibility to create kid friendly options for our kids.  They can add a fried egg as an option to your burger, but won't literally scramble the egg to make a kid option.  Not sure how this is going to work for them at Downtown Disney.",

    "text": "QUICK & DIRTY: When compared to other casual-fun dining options on The Strip, this New York-based chain deserves a glance. (At least for you to check out their outta control, Instagram-worthy, and NSFW milkshakes.)  Things to know: ***** I. LOCATION: Black Tap resides on the first floor of The Venetian, next to their gondola rides, and fifty feet or so from the resort's main poker room. Just hug the rim of the first floor until you get there. (That's what she said.)   II. FOOD & DRINK: Again, people know of them because of their decadent milkshakes. I, unfortunately, couldn't indulge (because I didn't want to pass gas at a strip club and beach season looms ahead), but I opted for The Old Fashioned (burger) and onion rings and fries.   *The Old Fashioned ($18): They top the prime burger with crimini mushrooms, swiss, caramelized onions, and horseradish sauce cooked rare. The swiss, onions, and mushrooms enhanced the umami-ness of the beef, and the horseradish gave a nice kick. They offered a generous portion, too.   My bottom bun, though, soaked up all the juices and was soggy. So I thought they could've seared the burger better to keep in the flavors.   *Fries ($8): Seasoned well, but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't order them again.  *Onion Rings ($7): Gigantic, yet a bit too oily. I'd suggest these over their fries, though.  III. SERVICE: Fast (only took 15 minutes for my burger and sides) and friendly. No problems there.  IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: It's hip and unapologetically brash (good thing). I dug how they played East Coast 90's hip-hop above. That's wassup.   V. PRICES: You won't find a good deal there -- since it resides on The Strip -- but it is comparable (regarding cost) to the other food stalls and restaurants in the area. Therefore, Black Tap offers better value.  VI. OVERALL: I'd def try Black Tap again. One of the better options, for food on The Strip and a solid choice if you're staying at The Venetian.",

Definitely share one between 2 people. It's a h u g e portion with lots of candy/sweet toppings in addition to the standard ice cream/whipped cream deal.   Once you get over the ooh and ahhs of it, the taste of the milkshake itself wasn't anything extraordinary. It's the standard milkshake you could get at pretty much any ice cream store and for much cheaper than $15.   I did enjoy the atmosphere of Black Tap though. Very fun and the waiters were nice. Great environment for kids too (and they'll probably die after seeing and eating a milkshake here.)",

Located in the Venetian right next to the outside gondola ride. We sat at the bar area because we only wanted to order the milkshakes, no food. We ordered 2 and decided to share between 3 people. 1.The cookie shake- vanilla shake with chocolate drizzle and chocolate chip cookies rims 2. Churro choco Taco shake- vanilla shake topped with churros, choco Taco ice cream,caramel with a Cinnamon Toast Crunch rim. The cookie shake was a little bland for my taste but I really enjoyed the churro shake. For the 3 of us we couldn't finish the shakes.. definitely a 2 man job for 1 shake.. they were beautiful coming out but messy while eating. I would recommend this place not for just the shakes but the food looked and smelled delicious, I was soo close on ordering food but I was completely full trying to finish that shake. My next try would be the food and the Sweet N' Salty shake. Keep in mind you can add a shot of liquor to any of the shakes for a price.",

    "text": "Living near NYC, I've wanted to try Black Tap but have hesitated due to the wait. Black Tap LV is located in the Venetian and appears to be relatively new with trendy decor.   We tried the burger (which comes with fries), burger salad and veggie burger salad. We all liked our meals. The burgers were good quality and the salad came with a special sauce, which made a good accompaniment for the fries - I recommend asking for a side if you get fries. The salads themselves had too much lettuce but great flavor. The cocktails were too sweet for my liking - both the froze and the mule - but my group enjoyed them. We were too full to get dessert/milkshakes but I'll definitely try them in the future in one of the NYC locations.",

    "text": "We were starving and exhausted, and wanted burgers. This place looked fine, and so we headed over and were seated at the counter, overlooking the sports betting area.  This was fine, mind you, because it was the Pac12 Championship game.   We each got a different burger, and True to form, I got one without the bun.  We passed on the milkshakes, but got cocktails and beer instead.  And Brussels sprouts, because how can you say no to the most underrated vegetable in the world?  The Brussels were tasty, and between the three of us, we didn't eat all of them (but likely could have).  The burgers came out very, very shortly after the sprouts, and they, too, were delicious.  Mine was a bit overcooked, but when you're a mid-rare girl, you take what you can get. The fries were just fries, but at least they were hot and crispy.   Black Tap has its own unisex bathrooms, which is a nice touch from having to wander the casino floor when you need to break the seal.  They were clean, and they were behind a giant candy bar (a bar that had different types of candy, not a supersized Snickers), so you had temptation when walking down there.   Service was great, friendly, and prompt.  The seating at the counter, facing the outside and the betting area can be hit or miss, because everyone can see you, see you eat, and talk to you directly, but if you're into that, this is the perfect spot for you.",

We asked to have the kids and shake and fries to come out at the same time,  as that was their meal, and instead the fries came out and the shake came out 15 minutes later.  The shake was all whipped cream and literally had to scoop all of it off to even get to the ice cream.  I understand it's completely IG presentable.  But as edible, they're should be a little more method to the madness.  The cookie crumbles were completely frozen to the side of the cup so that was inedible.  The saving grace was the burger which was well made and tasty but pretty small.  The picture make them look huge, but I've gotten big burgers at in and out for $5.",

Once we finally got a table (after we paid our tab) no one ever even came up to us. So Instead of actually ordering more food we walked out once we finished our drinks we paid for at the bar.

Pretty big thick size patty and the top it off with A onion rings that lightly bread and sweet Ray bbq sauce. My nephew had the California burger which is a turkey burger with avocado we both upgrade to sweet potatoes fries. I don't really believe that they're healthier for you. But I prefer the sweet potatoes taste.  The milk shake are massive and very well constructed. We had the cookies and scream and the ice cream sandwich that's on the side didn't melt and it was there for 40 minutes. Over all pretty good unique burger joint. Only think I wish my Bun was toasted. But the decor want me to take pictures everywhere in there.",

For just a side salad that was also amazing with a gracious amount of cheese and fantastic dressing. We shared the birthday cake shake and the shake was good but the cake was the best part so moist and great flavor. Our server Jason was very accommodating and showed us all the different shakes as he was running them to other tables. He made our visit a 5 star experience.",

Claimed they had to prepare table although the outside was nearly empty. Service was bad. We ordered onion rings. They brought the dressing without a utensil and we had to ask for small plates. Finally they brought forks. For dressing?  Burgers were good not great.  They did a poor job of busing and replenishing water and drinks. Ice tea came in a small glass and they charged for refills. The service was included in check--lucky for them or it would have been zero.  When I paid the check, the dishes from the onion rings were still on the table. So if you really want their exotic shakes (and they are great, although the monkey dishes they serve them on don't catch the droppings and there are many) bad enough to endure way below average everything else - then do it.",

He asked for a cooked egg and about 30 minutes later an egg gets delivered to the table next to us. Was he supposed to let his burger sit there getting cold? Just awful and they had the nerve to charge for the egg after we told him that obviously the burger was eaten while waiting for the friggin egg. My burger would have been decent if they hadn't charred it into a hockey puck. I asked for medium! I was so hungry that I couldn't bear to wait for another one. Then the table next to us gets a crazy shake they didn't order. When we ordered our shakes, it came out a completely melted messy disaster. A shake is supposed to be thick, not like water. If you want a good shake and burger, head over to the Cosmopolitan to Holstein's where they know how to cook food.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of eating at Black Tap Las Vegas inside the Venetian today.  To say everything was amazing would be an understatement!  It was great from beginning to end.  The hostess was very welcoming, and she seated us on the patio which had a great view of the gondola rides and the Las Vegas Strip.  There were a few of us dining together so we ordered several items on the menu from appetizers to entrees and ended with their crazy milkshakes.  The food was mouth watering and full of flavor.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions on what to order.  This place is a must try for locals and tourists alike.  It was not just a meal, it was a dining experience which is what going out to eat should be.  Black Tap is also perfect for corporate events and venue buyouts or for any social occasion.  Ask for the special events manager, Jose Saenz!",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to trying this place, but it was honestly a let down.   The shake was amazing, but I can always get a cheaper shake at Jack in the Box, for the same great taste.   The burger was mediocre, and they messed up my order. I ordered the truffle burger and they gave me the Texas burger, which I waited for my new burger for 30-45 minutes. I get that people make mistakes, we're human, so I tried to act polite about it, because I used to work with customers too, so I get it. Once the waiter brought out the correct burger, he then said, \"is this the right one?\" with such a bad attitude, at that point I was over this place. I just wanted to leave. Then once we got the bill, my burger wasn't even discounted let alone free, because at that point, with his bad attitude, it should've been at least discounted, but of course not, since this restaurant is in Vegas. I didn't voice my opinion, I didn't want to make things worse for our group.   The waiter had the nerve to add 18% gratuity to our receipt because we were a big group, which I understand, but with the service he gave us, he didn't deserve it.   So to wrap it up: save your money and just go to In-n-Out.",

This place hasn't been open for very long so that means they bought cheap tables that wobble. Of course we had to order the infamous $15 shake, tried the chocolate chip cookie shake. It was good, but was brought out at the same time as our appetizer which I guess is ok but would have preferred to be asked when I want my shake. Burger was good, fries were too salty . The most outrageous part of the bill was a dollar charge for each side of ranch. I've never heard of a charge for ranch EVER! I hate restaurants that upcharge without letting the customer know. Very sneaky and leaves a bad taste. Probably will not be back.",

They \"Don't Sweat the Technique\" when making the best craft milkshakes I've seen and tasted. I believe their Crazy Shakes is what makes their bar/restaurant stand out aside from the furnished designs. I love that I could sit anywhere and it's a different theme to vibe from. You could even take a step out into the patio and enjoy the view of Las Vegas' replica of Venice and the Gondola rides. The All American Burgers, fries, beer and Shakes sure did brought new attention the the Venetian! Prices are fair considering it's on the Strip, so expect to pay double digits for their items.",

As soon as I got checked in and got to my room, my best friend recommended we run down to Black Tap since we were starving and needed food before getting into more stereotypical Vegas fun.   I ordered the Chili Cheeseburger and watched in fear as I saw what they are famous for being prepared. These huge milkshake mountains are insane and they have a ton of variety in terms of what kind you can order. I went with one covered in Fruity Pebbles and candy and whipped cream and cherries and everything and sugar and you get the point. Needless to say my tummy was feeling a bit bloated after the fact but it was my own decision and I stand by it.   Definitely give this place a try if you are near it and if you love burgers, fries and massive milkshakes that could probably solve a lot of the World's problems.",

It's so much fun to look at the bar from all the crazy  milkshake ingredients! We decided to sit outside (we're from Vegas.. we can take the heat.. right?) haha. It wasn't too bad because it was shaded. Our server was awesome, super informative it being our first time and he showed us a new limited time milkshake for 4th of July. Now, let's get to the food! The menu has a wide variety of appetizers, entrees, and desserts (milkshakes!!!). The prices were pretty high, even though the food still sounded delicious. We opted to try for a few different appetizers rather than individual entrees since we wanted to try more items/my mom basically only eats chicken tenders lol. I got roasted Brussels sprouts (crazy delicious, and a nice portion since no one wanted to share). My mom liked her chicken fingers, and my little brother ordered a kids cheese pizza. He ate most of it, so we'll take that as a good sign! Finally, the milkshakes! We went back and forth on which one to choose since we were all going to share. Finally decided on the Cotton Candy Milkshake. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll devour this whole thing. For me, it's just a lot going on, but I still enjoyed a few bites. I would love to try the cookies and cream one next time! All in all, enjoyed my experience and would recommend to people by the Venetian for sure. Hey it's free parking too! I'd probably return just for the milkshakes though if I'm just by myself. If you're ready to try the most extravagant milkshake you've experienced, come on down!",

That being said, I was soooooo excited to try this place, and while the shake was good it wasn't something I'd rave about. I got the cookie shake, but asked for the shake to be chocolate instead of vanilla. I wish I would have kept it vanilla because all I could taste was chocolate syrup. Not sure why they couldn't just use chocolate ice cream?? But okay.  The cookies are the hard cookies, not soft like you'd expect (or at least what I would expect). The best part of the shake was the cookiewich, even if the cookies were hard, and I put the frosting from the rim of the glass on it and it was very good!   For $15 I expected a little bit higher quality, but it wasn't awful. If I lived in Vegas I'd come back to try the other ones.",

So, if you find this place, hidden amongst the gaming areas of the Venetian, ask for Viv! She was STELLAR!! Super sweet and perfectly attentive. I was a single guest among a bar of men visiting for a Gun Show or the World of Concrete expo. Viv made me feel comfortable and kept a close eye.  I visited because of a post I saw on Instagram about the Crazy Milkshakes. Could not have been happier! Viv suggested the Blackout before pointing out the secondary favorites, all of which I was debating. She pinpointed exactly the ones I was back and forth on. So, since great minds think alike, I took her advice for the blackout milkshake. Always listen to Viv! She told me that the brownies were the best she'd ever had and knowing how most brownie sundaes go, I didn't expect much. Totally shocked! Sweet but not over powering. Rich but well paired with a traditional chocolate shake.  After seeing me attack this thing alone, three guys at the end of the bar, tested fate. Let's just say, they couldn't hold their own to a kiddie cup! Each one hardly finished half. They ordered the cookie version, birthday cake and Oreo. Not a trophy they'll hold anytime soon! If you're craving something sweet, it's a must. The food looked great too but I was on a mission. Try this place, you'll be glad you did!",

The restaurant was somewhat difficult to find so give yourself some time to locate it. There was also a 40-45minute wait. I'm not sure if they take reservations though.   Once we got seated, our server was super cool and upbeat. We ordered Mozzarella sticks, and fried pickles to start. Which were delicious! Then, my friends ordered salads while my wife and I shared the Vegan Burger which was also delicious. For dessert, of course we ordered their famous shakes. We had the Sweet & Salty and our friends had the Cookies and cream. Both were Instagram worthy lol and of course delicious!   I took off a star because we had asked our server to cut our burger in half for us to share with an extra plate, but when it came out it wasn't done. Also, my friend didn't like the dressing they had put on the salad.   Overall, I do recommend. It's s fun and delicious place with a DJ too. His choice of music was on point!",

Before you can dive in and begin drinking your milkshake you first must eat your way from the outer portion of the milkshake from all of the toppings and candies glued and stuck to the outside of the ice cream Tang makes getting to the center of the milkshake even that much more enjoyable. Most people will wait to grab a milkshake as their dessert but my suggestion is that you grab the milkshakes first in order to enjoy it throughout your visit because it will take you that long to get it completed. Now the milkshake Shirley aim to please however their burgers are great too. Their burgers are cooked as requested and with tons of flavor however if a hamburger is at your thing they do have great salads listed on the menu for you to try to which come in a very generous size as well. However, upon my return I will definitely be back for their milkshakes again because they were that great. That's known for their drinks and their milkshakes",

Great vibes, even better music and the service was on point.  At the end we all got those huge shakes to top the night off.  We all had a great time.  The only down fall to me was the place was a little too pricey for burgers, fries and shakes.  That being said I would definitely go back again cause the experience was a GREAT ONE!!!",

My man got the basic burger and I chose the one with mushrooms and horseradish. My burger was tasty. The basic burger was lacking flavor. I upgraded my side to homemade onion rings. Well, when we received them, they were cold and soggy. The bartender happily got us some fresh, hot rings. They are breaded in a light flour, but they aren't as crunchy as they should be. Maybe they need a cornstarch or rice flour dusting instead.  In all, we were a bit underwhelmed with our visit here. We've had better burgers, fries, and o-rings elsewhere. I should have just had a giant milkshake and appetizer.",

Nothing heavy just something to hold our liquor down...lol. We all went to  Black Tap (inside Venetian Hotel) and there was a line outside the door. (I don't like lines) I went and spoke to the hostess, (Kat and ummm, dang it I forgot the other young lady name...sorry). I explained to them why we were there and we needed to get seated quickly so we could get a jump start on the 50th birthday shenanigans! The hostesses were SUPER SUPER nice and very accommodating. We ended up sitting at the bar (which was perfectly fine with us) and met the BOMB ASS mixologist Joanna. OMG when I tell you that home girl was sooo cool and friendly. She was really on top of her game while taking care of us and her other patrons. She went above and beyond to make sure that we had a really good experience at the restaurant. Truthfully, I don't really remember our main meal (like I said it was last weekend) but I do remember that BOMB ASS birthday cake and those shots that Joanna was serving us!!! LOL  Thanks Black Tap for your GREAT service! My crew and I will be going back to Las Vegas to get \"Black Tap'd\" again! Ha Ha Ha",

While our intent was to only order a shake, we decided to start out with some snacks.  That was an epic mistake and a total disaster.   We ordered the mozzarella sticks and they didn't have any cheese in it. They were empty!!   Then we decided to order the wings and they were raw.  Completely raw! The only part that looked cooked was the outside.   We came for the Cake Shake and it was outstanding!! I liked how they put the icing on the outside of the cup and put sprinkles on it. The cake on top was delicious and the shake itself was amazing.  We did have a great booth because we were right next to where they make the shakes and it was cool to watch them prep and make the shakes.  The service. Was not very good either.   We had dirty plates on our table for 15 minutes and dozens of employees just walked by completely ignoring them.   The waitress was pushing us to get our shake before we were ready and was really worried after our food mishap, as she should be.  The most comical part was when she told us that the cheese evaporated from our cheese sticks.     I know that I won't be going back to that place.   While the shake was good, Las Vegas offers much better options for dining and desserts with better service.",

The milkshake is decent, but about the same quality as sonic and way over rated. The food was pretty terrible. We got burgers, very salted and over cooked patty. It was very tall and greasy. The grease soaked through the bun really quickly and it was inedible. Fell apart in my hand. I'd say skip this place. It isn't worth your time, even the bar has a huge menu in front of the tv. Why have a tv if you can't see it? The only thing I can say is that the early 90s music is probably the best part.",

It's located inside the Venetian Hotel. It's really cool the way they have it decorated inside and it's trendy and hip. Now the food wasn't that great I don't think they're meant to be a restaurant I think they should just be a shake and bar place. I ordered a vegan burger, it was so soggy and just spilled out everywhere I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered onion rings and they were the large cut onion rings I mean large it was unnecessary. The fries were the thick cut not wedges but steak fries and I don't like thick I think thin ones taste so much better. The ooh ahh factor were the shakes of course but in all honesty who can eat all of that with all the toppings. It looks so cute and pretty you don't wanna mess it up. The shakes were like $14-$18, very high-priced I don't know if it's worth it , maybe to say you had one but is that really worth it? We left there hungry. The service was great, the music was great 80s and 90s :). but I don't know if I would come back there again the food just didn't do it for me or the people I was with. We spent $190 on my burger and onion rings, 2 small salads, side of fries, 3 shakes and a mini one. We could've eaten at yard house for less. (I love yard house food, always consistent)",

I think we were all too full because the four of us barely ate the two we ordered but they were still amazing! Fun for photos, fun selection to choose from and although they are $15 each it's pretty normal Vegas pricing seeing as how Johnny Rocket's charges $9 for a regular milkshake. I can't say how the food is since we only went for the shakes but I'd recommend this place based on the shakes.",

Bar was friendly and helpful and I cashed out giving 20%tip.  We were seated at a table close to the desert station and since it was my first time I was super excited to see all the shakes made. Our waiter came up and never introduced himself and started asking us what we wanted and if we just sat ourselves.  We were a stunned that he was questioning us instead of welcoming us to this awesome establishment.  After the misconfusion we ordered drinks and we split a burger.  No refills were ever giving and he was super inattentive.  We then ordered 2 shakes. I asked which one was best the cake or the oreo he said oreo.  I ordered oreo and friend ordered churro.  Only one shake came and we didn't want to eat one with out the other it took him about 10 min to ask is if everything was ok.  I said I'm waiting for my shake and he said oh u wanted 2 and I said yes he ordered churro and I asked u which is better cake or oreo and u said oreo and I said ok I'll have the oreo did you forget?? He said calm down it will take to seconds to come out and I said well I wanted to take a pic of both and now this ones melting.  He said hang on and left.  While gone I asked busser to pre buss the ta le and please give us refills on our drinks.  The food was amazing and the shakes were fun but the service was horrendous.  I will recommend this place but with caution and I will be back for the cake :)",

Service was quick, the taplist is extensive, and the shakes are insane. Unfortunately 3 of the orders came out wrong (over cooked, undercooked, and another with a wrong side). These things happen and it's not a big deal, however it took over 35 minutes and replacement burgers were not brought out. The manager came by 20 minutes into the delay to say it was on the house and they'd be right out, however it took vastly longer. Everyone else at the table was done eating and the burgers still hadn't arrived while numerous other tables had been served in the interim. Our group will never return and I'll happily tell anyone whole cares to hear that this place isn't worth the trouble.  Overall the food was good, however the price and service did not match.",

Portions were large too. Service was ok, but it was late and had the feeling the staff were ready to go home, they were not that attentive. The decor was very retro and trendy, lots to look at and they have a huge outdoor area which sits on to the canal so you can watch the gondolas go by.  If this place looks busy, the outdoor area is huge and you can't see it from the front so don't walk passed it, definitely check it out if not just for a milkshake!",

The wait was about 45 mins, the line was super long. Luckily we found seating at the bar because I was starving! Staff was very friendly, and prompt. The Korean wings! I'm telling you those were fire!!! The right amount of spice, crispy, flavor was on point! I almost chewed my fingers off!! The burger was so so...I think it could use a bigger bun, but...and for the main event that oreo shake! I have no words but simply divine! So worth the trip! Definitely a go to if your in Vegas! I'll be back for sure!",

Great service, friendly atmosphere, only the best music, and to top it off phenomenal food. I've been twice now. From their monstrous shakes, almost perfect poured beers to a perfectly cooked burger. Guacamole you can eat by itself I just can't explain it you just have to go there!!  However, with all its deliciousness be sure to spend money. $15 shakes and $20 burgers, but you only live once and great food should be a must.  Going to NY next month to try the original Black Tap...to be continued...",

The restraunt was pretty empty but we were sat at a tiny table in between two other parties, one which was a very loud bachelorette group. Our server was ok, but seemed annoyed that we weren't ordering more food.   We had the fried pickles and they were extremely heavy so we didn't want much for our main course. I didn't really like my burger but my husband said it was \"so so\". The fries were bland.   The desserts looked really fun but after a heavy meal we werent interested in any more food. We were disappointed that this was the first experience of our trip.",

The place was half full and there was a small line of people waiting to be seated.  We walked in and asked how long the wait was and it was 15 min.    Asked if we could sit anywhere in the bar area.  Said we could.  So we did.  I ended up having to get my own menu.  Decided on the elderflower slush and a $15 Peanut Butter Shake.  This shake was no $15 shake.   It was a $4 at the most.   I have had better shakes from Sonic.    Waitress asked how everything was and I told her how disappointed I was with the shake.   A real let down.  She sort of apologized, I get it, it's not her fault.  Not even a comp and take away.  The shakes commit dessert fraud.  They pointlessly roll the glass in chocolate and candy, shove a couple of tasteless pretzel sticks in there, cram mini peanut butter cups on the rim...and stick a WRAPPED sugar daddy lollipop on the whip cream that gives these shakes their height.   I dug down into the glass hoping to find that $15 bite but it never happened.   It was melted peanut butter ice cream soup.   I can confidently say I won't be back or recommend this place.     There are better options",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to trying a crazy shake from the Black Tap for about 6 months. I spent my 21st birthday in Vegas this week and made it a point to visit The Black Tap.   Upon arrival, we were seated across from the bar. After at least 15 minutes, we hadn't had a server approach us. So, my boyfriend walked over to the bar tender and asked for assistance and she said \"Oh, just go let the host know thats where you've decided to sit and they will send a server over.\" Mind you, the host sat us. And we were in plane view of the hostess stand where they could clearly see we hadn't been helped. I thought that it was very strange that somehow is was OUR job to alert a server we were there and not the host. As we waited frustratingly, the hostesses kept throwing dirty look after dirty look our way as well.    Once our server finally showed up, we ordered a shake. The Bam Bam Shake to be exact. When it came out, I was so, so disappointed. The frosting around the rim was rock solid and obviously old. There was less than half of a pop tart sticking out of it, a plain Kellogg's Rice Krispie treat, and a laffy taffy stick, topped off with way too much whipped cream.   And the shake portion was an absolute joke. It was plain vanilla ice cream with fruity pebble cereal mixed in. So boring and not impressive at all. I didn't even come close to finishing it because it wasn't even good. It made me feel sick and honestly nauseas because it was so gross.   All in all, it was the most overpriced and oversold shake I've ever had. I would have been more satisfied with a Frosty from Wendy's. My shake was nothing as advertised. It was supposed to have a nerds rope, a full sized pop tart, and a fruity pebbles rice krispy treat.   The service was horrible, the employees were unfriendly and my whole experience was horrendous from start to finish.",

The milkshake I had was certainly diabetes in a cup, but it was an out of this world Experience, and that you should probably only drink once in your life, unless you are striving for morbid obesity and spiked blood sugar.  One of the most notable and enjoyable parts of the meal is the fantastic view you will have if you sit outside. The gondolas in Vegas are a landmark site, and provide some really fantastic people watching, if you're into that. You can see the reflection of the light on the water, and hear some gondoliers belting out tunes.   Check this place out for a unique dining experience",

    "text": "Great burgers and shakes that are worth a trip to The Strip. I've had this spot on my list for awhile and I'm glad I was finally able to give it a try.   On a Saturday afternoon my husband and I were seated right away. We were seated in a cool cave like booth right off of the bar. The vibe of the restaurant is fun and playful which added to the experience.   Our waitress was attentive and friendly. She asked if we wanted our shake after our burgers and I'm so glad that she did. The shake would have been a melted, unenjoyable mess if it had arrived with our burgers.   So many fun burgers and even some chicken sandwiches and salads on the menu. The Mexico City Burger was delicious. The actual burger had a great flavor and the medium preparation was perfect. The toppings and sauce accented the flavor with a perfect amount of each. My husband loved The Pizza Burger too. The Onion Rings were tasty, but they fell apart quickly making them hard to enjoy. Next time I'd go with French Fries because those were crispy and deliciously seasoned. Eat quickly because everything is messy. Once you pick the burger up and have it under control you won't want to set it down again.  Delicious burgers are only part of the fun. I've seen enough of the shakes on social media to know that my husband and I would be splitting one shake. Good thing we did since The Cake Shake was two full desserts. There was a full shake plus an entire piece of cake on top. Both were very good.   We'll definitely be back. This would be a fun spot to bring friends and family when they are in town.",

    "text": "I was really excited to go here and get a Crazy shake.  The shake was pretty good, but I was disappointed with the restaurant itself.  We came here specifically for the shake, so we came at an odd time so we'd be hungry.  It was like 2:00 in the afternoon, it wasn't very busy, so we got a table.  We sat down, and our waiter came and asked if we wanted any drinks.  The person I was with ordered a drink, but I said I didn't need one because I'd just be getting a shake.  He seemed pretty put off by that, but it's a $15 shake!!! That's almost the price of a burger or whatever else you'd get!  I really did not like that, and then he made me feel bad.  However, like 5 minutes after that, a couple sat down next to us, and they only ordered shakes, too.  That made me feel better about it.  He made me feel like it was weird when I only came here for a shake in the first place.  So, he brought us water and I ordered the Cookie N Cream Supreme Oreo shake.  The water was brought in a bottle for the table, and it was warm, which we thought was odd.  But oh well, I didn't say anything about it.  My shake came out a little while later, and I took several pictures of it, lol.  The shake is worth getting just for it's Instagram worthyness. :)  So, I start to eat/drink this shake.  I took the cookie ice cream sandwich off first.  That was actually not an \"Oreo\" ice cream sandwich, which I was surprised by since Oreo is in the name.  If you've ever had an Oreo ice cream sandwich, they're really good, and the cookie part is different from a regular ice cream sandwich.  This was just a round ice cream sandwich, so I just ate a bite of it and left the rest, so that was disappointing.  There was a lot of whipped cream on the top, which I like, so that was ok by me.  I got some of the Oreos off the side of the glass and ate it with my shake.  For the people that complain it's small, I couldn't finish it.  I ate most of the cookie part off the side, but I had like a quarter of the glass of shake left and I didn't eat the ice cream sandwich, so it was large enough in mind.  In terms of the restaurant, we were seated with a table right next to us, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and it was actually hard to get out without hitting the people sitting next to us.  That is a little too close for comfort for me.  The bathroom was also strange, and was a one person bathroom with a locking door.  There were two of them, but it still was small for the size of the restaurant.  We both waited in line to use the restroom in the short time we were there.  We were also seated right in front of neon pink lighted lips.  Ordinarily this wouldn't have bothered me, but I needed to take pictures of this epic shake I was about to have, and they all have a pink glow because of the sign behind us.  With a little editing I managed to get a perfect picture of my shake though, so don't worry. :)  Overall, I got my shake and posted it to Yelp and Instagram and all the other places, and that was what I wanted to do, so it served it's purpose for me.  But, with all the great desserts you can have in Vegas, I doubt I'd do it again.  I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for it, which I did this time.  If I did go back, I was torn between the Cookies and Cream and the Cookie shake.  I'd go for the Cookie one next time.  I think the cookie sandwich would have been better than the \"Oreo\" one.  I think the Cotton Candy one is the prettiest one, but I don't like strawberry shakes or cotton candy, so that one is out for me, lol.  Instagram wise though, I think that's the winner.",

    "text": "We decided to check this place out. Shortly after being seated we realized it was a mistake. We should have left, but figured we'd give the place a chance. Maybe the food would make it all better.  The place is really loud. They squeeze you in so tight you're right next to your fellow diners.  When the waiter took our neighboring diners order he had to squeeze between us so his ass was right in my face.  When we ordered our burgers I asked if I could have mine medium well. I was told they don't do medium well because it's too difficult to judge. WTF?? That's the first time I've ever heard that.  We had a milkshake and although some of them are decorative they were very bland.  The burgers were average burger. And average isn't a good thing for what you pay at this place.  Overall very unimpressed. As a lifelong resident of Vegas this is just another typical tourist trap.   If you've somehow been coerced into dining here. I'm sorry. There are so many other better places to check out in Vegas.",

While we waited we ordered drinks at the bar. I tried the Smoke on the Water. It was a watermelon flavored drink and perfect for the hot Las Vegas night.  We were finally seated at an inside table. I was impressed with the unusual decor of the restaurant. We were also seated near the large milkshake station so I got to enjoy watching workers make the over the top milkshakes.  My only complaint was that the service was slow and our food took over an hour to get to us. I had one of the burgers and it was delicious. Not many restaurants can cook medium rare to perfection but Black Tap did.  I wish I would have had room for a decadent milkshake, but I will definitely be back to try one and sit outside when the weather is cooler.",

PROS: -HUGE burgers & great shakes :) -Friendly & fast service -Very hip & modern restaurant. I adore the decor -OMG THE MUSIC, it was bomb. I was honestly jamming to their playlist (they were playing Notorious Big)  FOOD 5/5: -The old fashioned ($18): Prime burger, mushrooms, swiss cheese, & horseradish sauce. & I got this with sweet potato fries ($2 extra). This was delicious. All the burgers are HUGE! You can honestly share it with another person.  DESSERT 5/5: -Cakeshake ($17): This was AMAZING!  I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. The slice of cake is on top of the shake, and the cake is delicious! There was 4 of us eating it, and we still couldn't finish it because our burgers was so filling.   TIPS: -Located in the Venetian; ask for outdoor seating because you get the view of the gondola rides & strip; IG worthy! -I went @ 10pm on a Friday night & it wasn't busy so that was nice :D",

I was with a group of friends and we ordered SO much stuff. Here's what I definitely recommend: the truffle burger. It was so delicious I kinda wanted another one. We also got the chicken wings, but they were a little dry. I mean I still ate it cause it was still good. But now onto the main focus: the milkshakes. I got the birthday cake milkshake. My worries were that the cake would be dry, but I had no reason to worry. The cake was actually so moist. However, the frosting was a little too sweet for my taste. The milkshake itself was also a little sweet, but I realized these milkshakes are more for show, so I was still generally impressed. Aight hope this helped!",

This restaurant showcases a retro feel combined with a creative spin to a traditional burger food menu that'll easily make any guest fall absolutely in love with this place. I'm not going to lie, I feel in love with Black Tap the minute I walked in the door and I cannot wait to come back!  The staff at this restaurant were absolutely wonderful in accommodating our group and making sure our food and drinks were served promptly. We had a few rounds of beers, some delicious appetizers (including the fried pickles & chips with guacamole which was the best guac I had ever tasted!) along with a delicious burger, and then topped it off with one of Black Taps infamous shakes-The Cookies and Cream Supreme!! Let me just tell you, this shake was absolutely massive!! My eyes lit up the minute I saw it! They truly know how to make a supremely delicious shake, one that is large enough to split with three to four guests (or if your up for the challenge, indulge in entirely on your own!)  Thank you to the wonderful staff at Black Tap who made us have a wonderful experience. Can't wait to come back again soon!!   To the business owner: I only have one request. Please bring back your Golden Knights themed shake!! I'm dying to try it!! Thank you!!",

Right outside the casino floor at the Venetian. Night one we split the Choco Taco and it was amazing. Next time I would ask for some added chocolate syrup or chocolate ice cream to  highlight the \"choco\" part. Night two we split the cookies and cream with some added liquor. Delicious!!",

Our waiter, Nigel, was amaze balls!  He gave us great recommendations and checked back often. My friend and I both ordered the Baja Grilled Chicken Sandwich, I opted for the onion rings. The sandwich was very good with a little kick to it. I had the Cakeshake for my milkshake and it did not disappoint. The cake on top was moist and the overflow of sprinkles were right up my alley. If you're in Vegas and not staying at the Venetian venture over like we did, the music is great (heard lots of classic r&b songs while we ate, so a plus for me).",

I had the Truffle Burger - it was rich and indulgent...it was almost ridiculous. These burgers are big and will definitely leave anyone satisfied. I have to say the Milkshakes were a disappointment - while they look crazy and incredible, it seems to be all show. I'm pretty sure they use vanilla soft serve and add different syrup flavors to get chocolate, strawberry, etc...they were very sweet - on top of that they put some additional things like cake and candy which add to the aesthetic of a crazy, Instagram-worthy shake, but they really lack in quality and flavor.  The vibe in the restaurant is lively and fun and really suits the Vegas atmosphere. The service was friendly and attentive. Since the portions are huge, I probably wouldn't take children here, but this place is perfect for teens and adults.  I'd definitely go back for those amazing burgers and skip the shakes.",

Loved the truffle flavor and bitter arugula.  Nicely cooked meat - good flavor.  Fries were tasty too.  Crisp outside and soft inside.  My coworkers all loved their burgers too.

    "text": "Updated Review: tldr 4.5 stars overall (disclaimer: may be due to adult beverages)  Burgers: 4 stars Fries: 5 stars Shakes: 4.5 stars Adult Beverage: 4.5 stars Service: 4 stars Price: can't really comment since it's Vegas where everything is expensive  I decided to gave this place another try because my friend Amy T was visiting Vegas, so just had to bring her here for their crazy shakes! We ordered the following: truffle burgers, Cookie Shake and Agave Picante ( tequila based cocktail shaker).   Burger: we both ordered the same truffle wagyu burger medium rare to see if there was any difference than last time. And this time around, it wasnt dry or well done at all! It was more like a medium well, but we both still enjoyed it and devoured the whole thing within minutes :)  Fries: were excellent as usual. I have to say it's def one of my favorite fries around! Maybe I will try their other burger add ons next time.   Shakes: we ordered the Cookie Shake this time, but I must say Cookies N Creme Supreme is definitely superior to this one taste wise. I'm biased because I Iove oreo flavored things. I didn't really enjoy the cookie ice cream sandwich on the Cookie shake, but the one on Cookies n Creme Supreme is yum. Regardless, all of them look so awesome that I had to make one my yelp profile pic haha... Also one on my dating profile as a great conversation starter - they always ask me where I got it from :P  Adult Beverages: they have great selection from craft beers to cocktails. We decided to share the Agave Picante (tequila, fresh strawberry, fresh jalapeno and lime) which is a shaker that is supposed to serve 4-6 people. Serving size wise, it was just enough for two people - it comes out to around 5-6 shot glasses worth of liquid. 5 if you receive a broken shaker like we did and end up spilling some on your table. However, we really enjoyed the taste and the slight kick to it.  Overall, we enjoyed our time here :), but still had room for more food. Next time, Brooklyn Blackout and Sweet n Salty shakes are on the list try!",

    "text": "Found this through an Instagram food blogger in NY because they are famous for their crazy, mouth watering milkshakes. I decided to celebrate my birthday here with the family. We came in around 12 noon and it's already packed. We were greeted as soon as we came in but server qouted to wait about 20 minutes to get us a table outdoors because everyone wants to eat outside with a perfect view of the Strip and the Gondola rides. Indoor sitting has plenty of tables and booths or you can also seat in the bar. Hip-hop/retro themed interior with great music but it was a bit loud inside. They have great selections of craft burgers and salads which comes with a side of fries. Extra $2 if you want to upgrade it with onion rings or sweet potato fries. Here's what we ordered: All American burger with fries, Californian Burger with Onion rings , and Texan Burger medium rare with fries (exactly what I ordered). Burgers were huge, savory and cooked in perfection. Onion rings were thick and crispy. Great service with fast, attentive and friendly servers (Thanks Carlos!) My mom wanted to order the Brooklyn Blackout (which me and my bf ordered on the first visit) but since it's my birthday we decided to get the Birthday Cake milkshake. Both shakes are delicious and a literal cake slice or a brownie on top of the shake but a diabetis in a cup! It's Pricey but you get what you payed for. Thank you BlackTap for an awesome birthday experience, we all left satisfied!  Check this place out, gonna be worth your trip in the strip. :D",

They We're pretty nice about it but a little annoyed. I understand after working years as a server but I also think it's Vegas and this should be expected at a resort. They wouldn't only allow us to sit at the bar even though everyone else was sitting at tables with food. The seats for bar were so high, uncomfortable for us. The shakes were so tasty and unique, great birthday treat after dinner. I have the cake shake with an entire slice of fun-getting cake on top! My boyfriend has the candy bar sweet and salty shake and loved it too. Over the top but perfect for Vegas. They don't really advertise liquor you can add to it but it's $8 extra. The only one they could suggest was Baileys, basic and went perfectly but I was also thinking vanilla or sweet liquors could work too. They should advertise this with more options. Easy way to bring in more money on over priced alcohol in Vegas. We rushed eating/drinking our shakes since we felt a little rushed and the seating was uncomfortable. If we are ever back would love to try a burger or sit outside earlier. Nice concept and fun shakes.",

    "text": "It's a rocking Aloha Friday (thank Karen for this name) and what better way to celebrate than with fabulous designer milk shakes.   This was the twins selection for my special birthday dinner from them. The thought process was a little by design too! Where else can one have,(no wrong word) experiences baby; the cuisine like Black Tap!  I know no other. The food is exceptional breathtaking. Yes, I used breath taking; since you will be gasping for air when you leave! The shakes are orgasmic (or one might come close)! Screams upon trying the shakes are recommended!  If one is seeking burgers that will make you think of other tingling thoughts and experiences than look now further than Black Tap! Plus the milk shakes are a wonderful bonus along side your butterflies they make at first glance!  We were seated immediately and as we made our way to the table wow the eye candy from the decor at each glance is amazingly grabbing! Then the tunes are so rocking. The music here will take your senses on a beautiful trip of those years when popular rap music was decent. Such-classics as Beasties, Bell Biv Devoe, and TLC! As you sit and eat your glorious glamorous milk shake you cannot stop dancing in your seat!!  The service here is impeccable and they are so friendly! The smile the waiter delivered was enough to put anyone in such a fantastic mood. Plus how can one not celebrate here when all that surrounds thee is funtastic treats that are so dazzling and beautiful; you probably will not want to destroy it! I'll have to shatter those thoughts since the \"shakes\" that I'm speaking of will melt if you do not eat them!  After the server explained the menu to us; this sadly being our first trip we ordered. We had the sweet and sour glamour milk shake! It is black cherry flavored. Being so hard to choose one; I used my favorite soda flavor to decide. It in its own right needs a freezer to be displayed for all to see; but we settled on eating it instead! The lovely candy decorating the cup is put on gently with frosting. You are able to drink and eat the candy display all at once. Slow and steady to the last drop this amazing masterpiece is!  The menu was constructed in a very simplistic manner! Burgers seem to be the main flavor! I enjoy a great burger once in awhile even though I lead a primarily vegetarian diet. I partake of meat to keep those bones nice and healthy. The menu here at the Tap has many choices to choose from if you just enjoy salad or something light. But the main reason most visit is for the glam shakes, cocktails, and burgers!   With so many amazing choices I was in a sweet and spicy mood when we visited, so I went with something bbq. One can never go wrong with the sweet and spice of a great bbq burger. The bbq burgers comes with huge onion rings and I ordered the bbq on the side. Of course I smothered the bbq sauce all over that burger. With the burger properly equipped to eat and the bbq sauce running down the side of the bun dripping on the plate now it's time to eat! That first bite will go down in the records as a score. The bacon on the burger was mesmerizing and is so thick. Before eating the burger I had to sample that bacon that was just beaconing to be taken! After regaining my breath from the first three bites speech returned and I finished that whole burger inch by inch until it was all gone.  The twins decided to share a burger and since they would rather have something that is common went with the regular cheeseburger for them. It comes with secret sauce which I believe is a thousand island dressing type of flavor. I of course had to sample their burger too. It was really good too. The bbq was the better of the two. Anything bbq is self explanatory!   While they offer dining outside on the patio this is a poor choice for LAs Vegas. The temperatures can reach over 105 degrees on a good day. No thanks, a side of heat exhaustion with my food kills my appetite. It also melts ice cream faster. We sat in the ac of the restaurant.   The lobby and dinning area is so unique and funtastic. It has beautiful vibrant colors splashed all over the walls. It has that early 1990s cool, mode attitude where all are welcome, but don't be hating! There are interesting seating choices all over the restaurant too. Your next trip to Vegas this place needs to be on the list of things to absolutely do!   Now that you know where to find burgers that will take your breath away and milk shakes that look like the beautiful members of Poison or Motley Crue now you know where to come! There is one downfall of this fantastic restaurant, ready prepare yourself; they do not take reservations; unless the party is at least 10 plus or more! The wait on a busy can be high I have been told! I did not experience a wait; but just wanted you to know.   What are you waiting for go get that glamorous dazzling milkshake and decide if you will dive into temptation like we did!",

    "text": "We went to this place on a busy Saturday evening. We were told we had to wait in line for about 30 minutes to get a table. But since this place was so hyped up we decided to go for it and wait. When we entered the restaurant and were shown to our seats, we realized that it was right by where they made the milkshakes. It was a bit annoying because it was kinda loud and there were so many people coming and going from there. When our server came we ordered right away because we knew that it was gonna take a while for our food to come and it did. We ordered two burgers, one old fashioned burger $18 and one truffle burger $22. we are huge lovers of truffle so thought why not splurge on a truffle burger. When the food arrived we tried it and it was awful... The meat was overcooked, the charr on the outside was so strong that we couldn't taste much else, and the worst part is that the truffle burger did not taste like truffle at all... and honestly, if I am paying $22 for a burger it better be amazing. the fries and the tartar sauce were the best part of the meal alongside the teriyaki broccoli. I don't know if their shakes are that amazing either so I will have to come back just for that...",

We sat outside on the patio and it was perfect. You can see the canal and the gondolas.  We ordered an array of food and my favorite were the truffle burger (it was cooked perfectly and was juicy) and the fried pickles. The breading on the fried pickles were light and crispy, just the way I like it! I shared the peanut butter shake with a friend. It's definitely decadent and a great way to end your meal.",

I am disappointed that Venetian would even let this place open up inside the hotel.  Everything felt rushed including my food. My server, I can't remember her name but she had black hair & it seemed like she didn't want to be there. She was very short with us & it Looked like she just wanted us in & out of the restaurant...she was also really loud & obnoxious when she was talking to the other staff members around the restaurant it seemed like she was intoxicated. On top of the music being overbearing and loud the restrooms were really dirty and it was dark.",

It just gives us the nice vibe without the fancy. It's a pretty casual restaurant.   We came on an empty stomach cuz I figured milkshake might be too filling. I shared the milkshake I ordered with my boyfriend.   The shake we got was the cookies and cream supreme. The milkshake itself was BOMB! Now, I hate extremely sweet milkshakes. I can't stand it.   Their milkshake was the perfect amount of sweetness. The rim parts tho, I avoided all of that. I took a bite off it and it was just too sweet so don't do it if you're picky. But the milkshake was the right amount of sweetness. Even the ice cream sandwich that was stuck in the milkshake was not extremely sweet so they got it down!  I'd like to come back and try the food here too next time. The milkshake was a bit pricey at 15 bucks but I mean that portion!!! Our service was also really fast considering it's the week of CES.",

My other half and I stopped in for an afternoon snack and decided to get an order of onion rings and split a minty milkshake (I can't recall the name). The milkshake was good, though quite frilly. I don't get the whole frills of milkshakes. It reminds me of being 5 and loading up your ice cream bowl with every topping imaginable, only to pick at it and not eat the actual ice cream. The actual ice cream was good, but I could do without the extras. The onion rings I was not impressed with at all. While the rings themselves were huge (which was cool), the breading was bland and kept falling off altogether and making it awkward to eat the actual rings.",

    "text": "After our experience, Samantha promptly emailed me back to resolve the matter. She happened to be visiting the Las Vegas location the next week and set up a convenient time for myself and my boyfriend to come in and meet her and have dinner on her.   We arrived at 7pm and we were sat once again outside in the patio area, by our request. (Side note: the family of ducks wandering around is beyond adorable!) Samantha assured we had an attentive server. I wish I caught his name because his service was phenomenal. He greeted us in a timely manner, took our order, and quickly delivered our drinks to the table.   We ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich once again and the Greg Norman burger with raw onion and bacon. We specified we would like the burger cooked medium. We chose fries as both of the sides.   Samantha came out shortly after to chat with us about our previous experience. She mentioned how that does not reflect the service they hope to provide their guests. She was super sweet and apologetic and even ordered a few appetizers for us to try out. She ordered the Teriyaki Broccoli and Fried Moz, which both were delicious. My boyfriend and myself particularly liked the Teriyaki Broccoli the most!   Our food eventually made it out and our burger was perfectly cooked medium! Hallelujah! The Greg Norman burger stole the show. I'm not even kidding.. the burger was so delicious and juicy. It was by far the best thing we ate that night. This is what I had been expecting my first time! This burger finally lived up to the hype and the price. Of course, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich tasted amazing. The Korean BBQ sauce that is served on the side is delicious.   I would like to mention our server was extremely attentive with filling our drinks and clearing plates during our whole meal. Silent service is important to me and he was AWESOME! Once we were finished with dinner, we went ahead and ordered the Cookie Shake. Samantha joined us to ask us how dinner was and to let us know she had ordered another surprise shake for us.   Both shakes made it out and they look incredible and Instagram-ready! The Cookie Shake was totally my jam as it was the perfect balance between vanilla and cookie and also wasn't too thick. The surprise shake was the Golden Knights Shake, in honor of the Las Vegas hockey team making it to the Stanley Cup; my boyfriend loved that shake!   Thank you SO much to Samantha for making this right. Our experience this night was exactly what we were hoping for the first time around. The service was incredible and the food was delicious. Overall, Samantha went above and beyond for us and I'm truly grateful for that.",

We had fried pickles too which were too hard to bite, burgers were blah then we had to see the hype about their crazy shakes, we had the cotton candy, Bam Bam and dark cherry shake and all the flavors were all very weak, it was blah.  If you want great delicious burgers and shakes or smoothies, run away from this place and take your appetite to LVB Burger, inside Mirage. Everything on the menu is delish!!! The fried pickles, guacamole egg roll things, mango mojito and the s'mores shake are all addicting!",

This place has a dope atmosphere and we couldn't believe the flows of True Hip Hop - old school and new - that flowed through this place. But then - we saw one of these insane hand-crafted Milkshakes at a table next to us and we had to at least try one. My boyfriend had the \"Bam-Bam\" which was a fruity pebbles lover's dream!! And after some amazing burgers came my dulce de leche  dream! It had churros, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and a choco-Taco!! Add the Carmel sauce that topped it off and I was in heaven!! And if you're a pickle lover you have to try their in-house made pickles that aren't focused on your typical dill flavor - this pickle tastes more like cucumber and it was soo good! Speaking of good - can I just take a moment to recognize Luis?! Our service from him was amazing - i trusted him to order a shake for me and he didn't disappoint and his energy is addicting!! Also - the Manager on duty was attentive and gave us some background on the concepts and history of Black Tap (don't worry we asked for this info because we started looking into who Joe Isidori was because we couldn't get enough of the art and music and food he has created along with another famous chef) and we enjoyed his conversation and he made us feel so welcomed! I believe his name is Eric but I could be wrong - not because he isn't memorable it's because my memory is not the best. But I'll never forget how the staff made us feel because it's exactly part of the reason we will be back now that we live in Vegas and we will travel to experience Black Tap NY!! Thank you Black Tap LV for this experience - see you soon!!",

I appreciate his honest opinion, but I needed to try it. The food fell very short of expectations. My burger was nice and pinkish red on the inside, but extremely charred on the outside, which made it very dry and IMO inedible. I only had 3 bites and couldn't eat any more. The fried pickle chips were extremely salty. I believe it was in the batter because the sliced pickle I got on the side of the burger was not salty at all, in fact it hardly had any flavor. My cotton candy shake was awesome to look at. It was simply a strawberry shake with cotton candy and other bits of candy all over as decoration. The strawberry shake itself was good. I did enjoy the candy, but nothing creative on the flavor profile. Over all, I would probably never go back.",

After the drinks the food was just mediocre, I had the pizza burger and I can honestly say I've had better burger patties at fast food places especially for a burger to be $15 I'd rather have gone and gotten a $5 burger. Also we went for a birthday and the birthday girl couldn't receive a milkshake because they ran out of supplies.

The decor and ambience was great...just wish that there was more guidance on how to get to the restaurant since it's within the Venetian....which is huge.....it's near/next to the poker room. Parking is free! :)",

The food is okay and the shakes are good but my bill was 93.00$ for two burgers, two shakes, and two iced teas that were so watered down it was like drinking water.

They had a nice selection of beer on tap and the setting was casual. The staff was friendly and polite. My wife said the truffle burger had a really good, unique taste to it. She ordered hers well done, as always she emphasized well done. When it came time to eat there was some pink in the burger. Not a huge deal but she would've preferred no pink. My burger was ordered medium and came out as such. It was very tender and flavorful. We both went with fries for a side and they were crispy and very tasty. We thought about going back later during our stay but opted for a new place.",

I like mine well done so it's okay but the rest of my family was disappointed.  The bathroom was very untidy and looked like it hadn't been serviced in awhile. Restaurant wasn't busy (we didn't have to wait for a table) so I feel like they should've been more on top of this.  The crazy shakes (a main draw for them) are served on a tiny little plate and everything kept falling off the sides and hitting the table... gross! EVERYONE around us was experiencing this... Just serve it on a bigger plate, duh! Our server: didn't bring refills on water or iced tea unless you asked for it... which we had to keep doing! You'd think she would've gotten a clue eventually to keep an eye out for that but no:( She didn't clear away the empty plates as we finished and generally she had no personality.  Not sure I'd go back for the $15 milkshake and mediocre service.",

We went in it was around 10:30pm on a Friday place was busy but not overly crowded, so we sat at the bar. Waited for about 5 min before the bartender came over with her miserable look on her face to start us off with water and then walk away. Unfortunately it wasn't the way my buddy wanted to start his trip to Vegas so we left. I've talked to others with the same experience so obviously they need to change something. Let me know when it's fixed so we can try one of those amazing looking shakes.",

    "text": "Service with attitude.   The location on yelp isn't accurate and the restaurant just opened so it isn't on the directory yet. It's in the Venetian near Noodle Asia.  So we got to the restaurant and we stood in line to be seated. There were about 4 people ahead of us and no one behind us. The people in front of us got seated and the hostess came out and asked how many were in our party. We said four. The line to wait got longer. Maybe about 15 minutes later, the hostess walks past me and covers half her face with the menus and told me to not notice what she was about to do. She skips us and goes to the group behind us because they were her \"friends\". I overheard her say \"where is the rest of the party? I can't seat you guys if you guys aren't here. I'll get in trouble.\" No you'll get in trouble for the poor customer service you've provided and catering to your friends first. So instead of tending to us and seating us since we were first in line she stood behind us and starts chatting away with her friends in line. The other hostess comes out and asked us if we had two in our party and we corrected her and said four and she argues with us and said \"no you told me two.\" How about instead of arguing with your customers, you actually treat them decently and seat the people according to who got there first instead of catering to your friends. The attitude doesn't stop there. When we finally got seated (which there were many booths that could seat four available so I don't know why it took 25 minutes to stand in line and wait), we asked for more forks since there weren't any left in the jar. Instead of just saying \"sure I'll get some more for you\", the server smirks back \"aren't there some next to you?\" And we had to tell her there are no more. Our server walked by five times and never refilled our water until the end. When we were ready to order the shakes and tried to catch her attention she just walked past by.   Overall, our experience dining here was very unpleasant because of the staff. The food was quite pricey and very salty. We would not come back and would rather go to another place with better service. One that doesn't come with so much attitude.",

I tried their Cake Batter Crazyshake, which was AWESOME. It's a cake batter milkshake with clumps of actual cake batter inside it, decorated with a thick rainbow sprinkle rim, an actual slice of cake on top, also topped with icing, whipped cream, and a cherry. The service was great as well. I only stopped in for dessert, but from what I saw on the other customers' tables, I am definitely coming back for food and another milkshake.",

My last experience prior to this dinner was superb and I went in with high expectations, which were fulfilled, once again, to the fullest. I recognized the manager John from last time, and he remembered us too. He got us the best booth in the house, and went out of his way to take care of us! Our food was brought out quickly and was excellently presented. We had a few orders of the onion rings (best in town), and I had the Baja Chicken Sandwich as my entree. I'm picky with my chicken sandwiches, but it was everything I could ever want. Tried one of their specialty cocktails that John suggested, and it was amazing as well! John singlehandedly made my birthday one worth remembering, and I couldn't be more thankful. Thank you Black Tap for being such a well organized and fun establishment. I can't wait to go back!",

As soon as you walk in, you are invested in a very artistic and colorful resturant with upbeat music, and chatter all around, whilst still being a fun and relaxing atmosphere. The selection of foods aren't very vast, especially if you're Vegetarian or Vegan. We began with ordering what is called \"Fried Mozz\" as an appetizer and it was presented with sprinkled cheese on top of the fried mozzarella, served with a delicious dipping, immensely savory and tasty! After, I had a Falafel Burger, along with fried and full sized onion rings, while my wife ordered the Black Bean Burger with French Fries. The food itself was delicious, filled with flavor but nothing spectacular. After we ordered what was anticipated, one of their over the top \"Crazy-shakes\". We got the \"THE CAKE SHAKE / CAKE BATTER SHAKE\" It was just as delicious as people say! Defenitly worth it, a bit more pricey than other places, but it's for the expirience & the expirience was a great one.",

    "text": "First and foremost, this review is solely based on the shakes, service and ambience. It was a bit of a journey to locate this place but it was worth the walk. Located across from the race and sports book, makes it an excellent choice when gathering with a group of friends and to catch the latest game. Upon entering this restaurant and bar, you'll notice the place has a semi-dark vibe but it was well lit with a cool neon light artwork in front that reminded me the 90s. It was kinda like if the show Living In Color collaborated with Yard House and Sweet Factory to create a hipster style restaurant.   Our main purpose of this visit was the popular crazy milkshakes. Friends from work, Instagram and various media outlets drawn us to try them out. We decided to sit at the bar and it was a perfect setting for people watching and photo opt. Raymond, our server was friendly and attentive. He kinda knew that we wanted their shakes and immediately took our order. Everything came out in a timely manner and when the actual shakes were place in front of us. A good amount of the patrons were staring at the shakes in amazement. They were all from Europe and gave us that...these Crazy Americans look, Lol.   My sisters and I got 3 different shakes and we should've got only 1 or 2, but we got excited and greedy and went with 3 different shakes. Ended up with the Bam Bam Shake, Cookie Shake and Cake Shake. All three were delicious! The Bam Bam Shake is a fruity pebbles shake with a pop tart and laffy taffy candy. This instantly reminded us of our childhood while watching Saturday morning cartoons. It was sweet but balanced in flavor. Cake shake had a good consistent flavor with the actual cake piece on top complimented the whole experience. Cookie shake was really good, especially the ice cream cookie. The actual cookie was soft and chewy and paired well with the ice cream. We all agreed that actual ice cream used was creamy and flavorful. If I wanted to have a cheat day, this place would be on my top 5 based on the shakes. I will have to come back and try their food but this review was based on the shakes, service and ambience.  2018 Yelp Review #9",

I know they have this restaurant in NY and it's very popular. The atmosphere was very causal. Laid back but nice. Good for families.

But very hard to eat without an extra plate.   I thought the food was really over priced based on what my friends ordered, they said they're burgers were good but not amazing. I also thought the milkshake was overpriced too but I get it, they're extravagant and known for that I think.   And thennnnn our server barely tended to us and also didn't give us a palazzo employee discount when we told her we worked in the hotel. It was extremely hard to get a hold of her when we needed to. Fyi- there's added gratuity for groups of 6 or larger.   Basically, I most likely won't go back.",

It was a nice place to eat. The music was incredible. It was like I had my own iPhone plugged up to the speakers. Next time I go I want to buy one of the shirts and try a different milkshake. Unfortunately I would only go back for the milkshakes. In my opinion the size of their burgers was just not worth it in the price.  I feel as if I'm going to pay $15-$20 for a burger and fries I want the patty on the buns to be bigger. But overall I would rate Black Tap 4 out of 5 stars. The music and milkshakes were great",

No vegan desserts though- you'd think if they had vegan burgers on the menu they'd have at least one vegan milkshake.",

Three beers, two cocktails, and two appetizers - $90.  (Tax and tip included.)  $9 for a beer at a place that isn't \"fancy\".  Er, ok.    The appetizers were really good.  Our appetizers (fried sprouts and fried mozzarella cheese) were good enough to make me think that they are serving a good product here.  The cocktails were great, and the service was really great.  The bartender was very personable and made some good suggestions.  If you'd charged me $60, then this is a five star review.  But, $9 beers and $15 cocktails require that you deliver something superlative, and Black Tap can't do that.",

    "text": "We walked in around 1230pm on a Monday and luckily there was no wait for a party of three and even had some patio seating open. All the staff was pretty friendly and the atmosphere of the spot was clean and fun. Started off with some ice water that is in the bottle that they leave on the table for you to refill yourself if they can't make it back when you're low. Ordered from fried mozzarella and changed the sauce to marinara. Also got the Cookie Shake which is like a hard childcare chip cookie and a vanilla shake and tons of cream and cookie crumbs. The shakes there are so outrageous they make the entire meal. They need to serve the shakes on a large plate rather than on a tiny saucer since it drips and spills all over. We then ordered the Pizza burger $17, The California burger $17 and the Greg Norman burger with wagyu beef and blue cheese $20. All burgers come with their regular fries but you can upgrade to sweet potato or onion rings for $2 more. One thing I didn't like is I ordered ranch on the side for my fries and they don't tell you his but they charge you $1 each for that! I think anytime there is an up charge they should let you know. Food came out quickly and was tasty. It's a gourmet speciality burger and shake shop on the strip and if you're lucky enough to sit outside you get to watch the gondolas pass. They play pretty good mix of music outside too. All in all I enjoyed my experience and the bill came to $70 something but we had a 20% discount for casino employee.",

Outdoor patio was inviting/cute (we we're a group of 7 girls) ducks from the nearby \"canal\" were enjoying any crumbs.  Our server had NO personality. Never said his name and unfortunately none of us have our receipts. Upon check out he informed us that he could split the check 3 ways... No big deal, we figured it out. But unfortunately he could not understand what went on what card. Even when we Wrote out the items on said receipts. The manager was finally involved and not sure why, he was no assistance.  On our way out.. I verbalized to said manager,  that our experience was not enjoyable. The manager then stated that the server found out some personal news and it was \"messing with him\"  We all have lives outside of work, we understand it's had to compartmentalize certain things. If that item is affecting your performance, you should go home or take a break. Not make our dinner a headache in a town of pure entertainment.  TL:DR, food fine, bad service experience",

I was happily surprised there was no wait. NOTE! They will not seat you unless your full party is there.  That atmosphere is great and the wait staff is friendly. I really loved  and the music they played. I saw a DJ booth, so I'm assuming they have a live DJ on the weekends/nights. Regardless of no live DJ the music was amazing, it was old school hip hop and pop.   Now to the food, I ordered the Crispy Brussel sprouts and Truffle burger with egg. Don't like Brussel sprouts? Order these and you will,  they are delicious, believe me you will thank me. I liked the Brussel sprouts more than I liked my milkshake and my milkshake was DELICIOUS. I ordered the Sour Power shake. And, sour power it was. First my shake was sour, then it was sweet. Or wait, I think that was just the sour patch kids that were on the side o my glass. Along with sour patch kids, I also enjoyed a lollipop and a pixy stick with my shake. Presentation was amazing, and black cherry ice cream melted into a perfectly thick milkshake. My burger was good, but is it really hard to ruin a burger? Nope.   5 stars, no wait, good food and great music! If this wasn't on the strip I would come here often.",

Great marketing by the way because after seeing them I was sold.  We went at a time where it wasn't too crowded. It was two of us and we were seated within 2 minutes. Our waiter was friendly and wasn't too far off if we needed anything. The decor nice and hip. Loved the paintings on the wall. The music was on point. Great selection of songs.  Our food was great and my daughter said hers was amazing. Good portions that got us full but yet we still wanted one of those yummy looking shakes. I had the cake shake & my little one had the oreo cookie shake. It was as cute & yummy as I thought. I was embarrassed because I ate ALL of mine and even started eating off the icing & sprinkles from around the rim lol   My only issue would be the smell of cigarette smoke while eating. There was a patio area so not sure if it was coming from out there or from the casino. Not pleasant when trying to eat.   Lastly, would be nice to see shrimp or fish on the menu...  *Side note: While stuffed, we were discussing what we will order next time we visit lol. We definitely enjoyed ourselves and have already referred friends & fam.",

The burger was moist and juicy with caramelized onions and mushrooms with just the right amount of Swiss cheese to put me on cloud 9! Then for dessert what more can I say then milkshake, milkshake, milkshakes!!! Pick one, pick two, pick them all and they are all unbelievable!!! We ordered the cotton candy milkshake and it was divine while others around us raved about the cookies and cream, the chocolate peanut butter and the birthday cake!!!

    "text": "This was my first time visiting Black Tap and we brought guest with us.  I was so bummed b/c service was not good. Our food took over an hour and the server was not attentive. I ordered the vegan burger it came out chilled. To say the least I was not happy, I sent the burger back and it took another 15-20min to come back out. When my food came out all of our guest were finished eating.   It was not a good experience for me and my guest. I will NOT be back or recommending this place. Hope you all have a better experience! Good luck!",

    "text": "I don't usually write bad reviews, but I was so disappointed in Black Tap. I ordered a simple cheeseburger medium rare. My burger came as a ball that was cooked medium well, not what I asked for. The burger was more like a meatloaf and had no flavor. I added salt, pepper and condiments to make it taste better. I still couldn't bring myself to eat more than half. My husband had the Wagyu burger and enjoyed it but said it was average. Wagyu burger was $7 more than my burger.  On a positive note, the view for outside seating was nice. There are lots of burger places on the strip. Try something else.",

Thought the milkshakes would be mediocre as I assumed it was just made for presentation but the shakes were awesome. Can't get enough of the cotton candy. Definitely hit the spot.",

    "text": "As a local I'd have to agree with everyone else asking what the hype is about this place . The burgers were mediocre at best (if I had to choose the truffle burger was my fav) and the shakes although very appealing to the eye are just a bunch of pre-made ingredients stacked and stuck to large glassware . The Brooklyn Chocolate shake tasted like Hershey's syrup simply mixed with ice cream & they use canned whip cream . For $15 a pop y'all can't make some fresh whipped cream and chocolate ganache ?! This is our second time here & probably won't be back .",

We were thrilled to see gluten free buns available.  The burgers were divine and of course we had to try a shake.  DeathByChocolate lived up to its name! Hahaha. Drinks, service, cleanlines all outstanding.",
