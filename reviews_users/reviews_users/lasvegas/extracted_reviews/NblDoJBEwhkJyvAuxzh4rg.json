    "text": "Been to Gyu kaku locations around the globe ( Taipei, Jakarta, West LA, Hawaii etc) and this is the worst.   Came here on a weekday with my family at around 5.45pm.There were only two tables seated with people and no one waiting. The server told us to wait 10-15mins. So we wait 10 mins and went up to her, asking if we could be seated first and looked though the menu as we have a show to rush to after dinner. She went to the manager and told us to wait another 5mins. We waited another 5 mins and nothing happens. We went up to her again and told her we will not order anything from the happy hour menu. She asked the manager again and told us to wait 5 more minutes. We were really upset and left. It's a horrible experience and service. I will definitely not visit this location again.",

Good service, good prices, and pretty good selection.   My favorites are toro beef (beef bacon) and yaki-shabu (beef chuck). They are thin slices and take less than a minute on each side to cook. Part of the reason they are my fav is cuz they cook the fastest! Haha. Filet mignon and harami miso steak are also very good, of course.   Try the buttered or cheese corn, bacon chips, garlic rice, and miso soup in between the grill changes ;)   Good luck and enjoy!",

My wife and I had to choose if we wanted to do ala Carte or pre fixe menu which we chose the $55 pre fixe, we did the math and it would come out cheaper and we get the chance to try different cuts of meat. Not disappointed at all most of the marinades we tried were miso based all of it were good. Filet Minon did not have a marinade still ended up pretty decent. Cheese Gyoza were OK, The salads we really liked. We finished dinner with Smore's which is a pleasant surprise since you are at a BBQ place why not smores right? Overall dinner was very good.  Location - Spring mountain and Decatur Cross Streets Asia Town, I prefer calling this place asia town instead of china town since it  is frequented by multiple Asian Ethnicity The parking is in the back and the entrance is facing the road.  Restroom - Clean   Restaurant setting - I liked the entrance with the displays of samurai helmet which tells you this Japanese BBQ not Korean BBQ.  Service - Service was good, although the server forgot 2 items on the menu she came back to us and added the other 2.   Overall - I would definitely come back to this place.",

Our server told us she'll send over the manager to talk to us about it, but nobody came over at all.  The service was horrible. The food was okay and it might have been better if our food actually came out like it was supposed to. We basically ordered 2 of everything but none of the 2 dishes would make it out the same time. To top it off, everybody there was so clueless.   I'm not planning to come back here and won't recommended to anybody.",

    "text": "Hostess were two young asian girls whom both gave excellent customer service. Bartender Bella is amazing. Managers (at the time dined in) were very genuine about customer satisfaction, and you could clearly see they cared about this establishment. They talked to each table and spent time to actually have a conversation weather that be in relation to the restaurant or of just random topics, they made everyone laugh and assured no one left disappointed- Even the staff seemed to be happy with Managers who were(at the time): Karsten, and Shayna-Marie. Servers were quick with refills, knowledgable with menu, and did not wait long to have our food out and even explained proper cook times as well as sanitation advice.   Great food should you choose the right marinade for your meat, along with the right choice of appetizers/sides ect. togo with it.   Try getting a few Sake Bombs with you and your date/or group of friends when Bella is tending the Bar- She'll make it one to remember !!!!!  All though this is a good review, don't think I will be returning based off of a few things I have seen and heard of about this place. I mean, looks can be appealing to the naked eye, but what goes on behind those curtains/doors(at any establishment) we will never know...unless we have be an employee there... Bottom line is simply this- It looks so fancy and high class from the moment you step into that beautiful glass door and vintage wood door entrance, but don't let that fool you... You just never know. But I do...... And I will leave this review at that -",

I eat rare steaks pretty often, so my body can handle a little rareness, but after eating here, my stomach has been turning for the past few days.  After several reviews that mention food poisoning and hair found in their food...cleanliness doesn't seem to be one of their main priorities here.  I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out like another Firefly's fiasco.  Besides that, the special drinks they have looked like it was created by a 12 year old.  I'll stick to the Sapporo...which by the way was a bit on the warm side.    The service was a bit \"meh.\"  I understand its a new restaurant and all, but the servers were inattentive and some of them looked confused even.  Not a very well organized restaurant in my opinion, and definitely needs a LOT of improvement to live up to the Gyu Kaku namesake.  I've eaten at the ones in Japan and I was SO looking forward to this one popping up in Vegas.  This was a complete let down.    I usually don't write reviews, but this place deserves the ONE STAR I'm giving.  If I could give it ZERO, I would.  I'm not sure why the others gave it 3 stars when you're finding hair in the food and also getting sick from the food here.",

I suggested this place because they are familiar with  or Yakiniku, Japanese Style Grilled Meats. Since my family and I are from Hawaii, Japanese influence is strong in the Islands so we are exposed to Japanese cuisine. We were quite please with the quality of the meats and the different sauces which created a different palate of flavor combination with all the different meats we ordered. Some of the items that were stellar for us was the Beef Tongue and Beef Angus Rib Eye. Some of the side dishes that caught our attention was garlic flavor mushrooms, seaweed salad & garlic rice was flavorful and consistent. The miso soup was a bit on the salty side. Overall we enjoyed our meal especially the Macaroon Ice Cream and S'mores.   The only downside was our server was a bit slow and rarely check on us if we wanted anything else especially for something like making sure if wanted more water. However it's rare that service is not at par because most times I've been here in the past, Service was great. Will be back when I or we have a craving for Japanese BBQ.",

A giant mug of Sapporo beer was only $5!  Our waiter was Yoshi, and he was wonderful. He was very attentive and managed to keep up with all of our orders.  We started off with some fried pork dumplings which were absolutely delicous. We decided to get the all you can eat BBQ. There are so many different meats, fishes, vegetables, appetizers, and desserts you can choose from. Almost everything I had tried was to die for. The meats are so tender and packed full of flavor.  I would recommend coming here with friends and family. It is a fun and different experience.",

Check out the appetizers, noodles and small plates sections to get your \"sides\" that are great portion sizes without waste.  The 32oz 'bathtub of beer' helped out in all kinds of ways!  It was really easy to spend the evening here, as after the meal, hanging out at the bar waiting on my uber prompted a half hour of casual bar time well spent.  Great service, even on a busy Friday night.  Thanks, Laura for the 'Beautiful Drink'!",

Always had a great experience but the Las Vegas location was very disappointing. Came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and got the Premium AYCE price for $42. Our server, Erik, was very professional and kind but the overall experience would not bring me back to this location.  As a party of 6, it took the kitchen awhile to get our meat order out. We were in no rush, so it wasn't a big deal. When the food came, they were overly salted. This included salads being drenched in dressing and beef tongue having a white layer of salt. It was so bad that we asked them to take it back. I had to eat a good chuck of rice to balance out the saltiness. I guess this is how they make their customer's eat more rice instead of meat.   Felt bad for Erik. He was working many tables and the kitchen wasn't helping his cause. Needed to get a grill change and it took us about 10 minutes to get his attention. Wasn't the best service but it wasn't his fault that the restaurant was under-staffed. Thanks Erik!  Got the bill and of course there was gratuity since we had a party of six. The thing that irked me was that they taxed gratuity. Not sure if it was legal to tax gratuity but they did.",

I got the All-You-Can-Eat that included the Kobe Beefs. But keep in mind that the different kinds of Kobe Beef plates, you can only get once. It is a very fun place to eat. Everyone has their own plate, and you grill together. It's a family restaurant I would say, and a great place for date nights.  The dessert - THE ICECREAM MACAROONS - are to die for.

I'll start by saying that I'm a strict vegetarian and wasn't expecting a lot of choices, but, it was his night so I would settle just for a salad if he enjoyed his experience.. omg!!   Place was busy but we didn't have to wait for a seat. Server promptly greeted us and was excellent throughout our entire visit. He got the all-you-can-eat $30 buffet, which has SEVERAL meats: beef, chicken, pork, seafood, etc., amongst MANY other options. Of course, none of that appeals to me, so I ordered off the EXTREMELY reasonably price happy hour appetizer menu. I was shocked they had such a selection for vegetarians! I ordered infused edemame, tofu nuggets, and cheese wontons. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! And filling! He loved the flavor of his carnivorous selections and appetizers also. Loved the music. Impeccable service by Jamie (according to my receipt that was her name).. you absolutely HAVE to try this place out! We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "After eating at Gyu-Kaku, I would've given my review a 4. However, our server Steven was incredible and made the review completely worthy of a 5.  Came here with my parents to enjoy a Christmas Eve dinner. Upon walking in, I first took note of the beautiful exterior. Walking in, the same enjoyable look followed inside. There were partitions between areas of the room and tables, making each party's experience more private.  Between us three, we picked the Meat Lover's combo that is meant for two people and a few side dishes of vegetables. It was totally enough for all of us, so I'd suggest doing something like this unless you're super hungry. It comes with miso soup, salad, an fried bread/cheese appetizer, fried chicken, and a handful of meats to cook on the grill. I didn't really care for the fried chicken or fried bread, but otherwise the grilled meats were all solid. My parents also both got beers because there was a deal where each beer (Sapporo) was $1.50. We were stunned!! Such a great price.  Service was just wonderful. Steven was an awesome server and exactly how I wish all my servers would be like. He was friendly and approachable, without ever seeming fake. He was always attentive, but didn't ever checking in too often which can also be annoying. Refilled our drinks without us ever having to ask. I've been a server in the past, so I guess I expect a lot, but Steven was just a natural. Seriously made our experience all the better. If you read this, thanks Steven!!! We're definitely going to ask for you next time we come.  All in all, Gyu-Kaku was rad. I think the pre-decided combinations are the most worth it, but a la carte is just as good too if you're picky and know exactly what you want. Definitely make a reservation as this place can get busy. But most of all, enjoy!",

    "text": "Two of my coworkers were celebrating their birthdays and decided to choose this place.  Growing up in Hawaii where we have many yakiniku places, I've yet to have tried one here in Las Vegas.  I gave this place a 3 star review - I normally don't give such low scores but this restaurant really needs to fine tune their customer service and wait staff skills.  The beginning of our evening was a rough start, but Lily and Anthony did their best to make sure we left with smiles on our faces.  When we entered in the place there was no one to greet us at the host station, so we waited...  I wandered around and it seemed there were only two or three people actually working. This was at 6pm, usual time for dinner, I reached out to one of the employees and we were seated immediately.  We sat and perused the menu and had random conversation, during which time we noticed another table was being seated.  While we waited for our server we noticed the new table that was seated was having their drinks delivered to their table yet no one has even bothered to come to our table to get our drink order...and we're a pretty thirsty bunch!  Irritated, one of my coworkers ask a worker to please take our drink order pointing out another table was seated way after we had already been sat.  Again, not a good start. We ordered everything, drinks and food. [Thank you Anthony who let us know he wasn't a server but took our order anyways.]  Our waitress Lily, as pleasant as she was, started delivering food and some of our drinks. It should've been drinks first and not random food dish items at the same time. What happens there is, my coworkers received their starter dish and no drinks while I received my drinks and no starters. This causes a very awkward and unpleasant experience.  Overall, the food was good. Nothing spectacular, the gyoza is of the pre-made family - I hate that in any Asian restaurant I go to, and I can tell frozen from a fresh handmade dumpling.  The meats were delicious, the poke was good that we order two dishes of it.   This place may have a good chance if they tidied up the experience and fine tuned their waitstaff' customer service. The one thing I did like was it seems the employees were happy to work there and that stands for something!  :)",

    "text": "We wanted to love it. We wanted to be excited. Perhaps, I wanted to love it and was overly excited to try somewhere new? Well, whichever it was...it was anticlimatic for me. My husband's review, \"it wasn't so bad\". They offered internal organs, of course he'll have such of an opinion.   We came in on a Tuesday not too long after they opened. Immediately greeted...check. Seated...check. I was completely excited to look over their menu, especially since we happen to arrive during Happy Hour. For some reason I still can't figure out, their happy hour menu wasn't as impressive. I suppose it was because the food itself wasn't.   ME:  Fusion edamame (garlic seasoned edamame) Spicy Tuna Volcano (crispy rice with spicy tuna on top) Beef tacos (won ton wrapper fried into a taco shape with bulgogi squeezed in) Miso Butterfish (butterfish in miso sauce with a pepper wrapped in foil to simply toss onto the grill)  HUSBAND: Tako wasabi  Liver (waiter said it was pork liver) Beef Toro Spicy Tuna Volcano Miso Butterfish  US: 2 Kirin beer  There was nothing spicy or even tuna about this dish. The crispy rice seemed to have more.flavor than the spicy tuna. To jazz it up I made it rain with a bottle of some sauce they have on the table labeled as spicy. But that wasn't spicy at all.   I do love they offer sweet potatoe FRIES. Having some kind of finger food for a 9months old to grasp and keep occupied is an immediate thumber-upper from me.  Miso Butterfish was alright. The sauce it steams in is very light in taste, which is a good thing for such a fish.  You get a small piece of fish, thankfully, it wasn't a small and thin piece.  Nothing spectacular. Since I do love eating fish, I still appreciated it.   The beef tacos weren't anything spectacular either. Maybe if they slid in 2 more pcs I wouldve said they were deeelish! Just wasnt enough bite for me to thoroughly assess. A little expensive for what you get happy hour or not. Man, I'm starting to think I came in way too hungry.   Can't review on the liver, I don't eat that stuff. Husband said twas alright. He did note that the Tako wasabi was his favorite and thought twas pretty good. So if you are into the raw stuff, that just may be your deal.  The beef Toro to me didn't look too fresh...freshly frozen...freshly defrosted frozen...freshly flashed frozen? Whichever...just didn't have that nice color to the meat the way I'm accustomed to seeing at Gangnam. It was marinated in something but upon eating it, I couldn't even taste it out.   Prices were alright considering it was happy hour. I think I was overly excited in my head so perhaps I was expecting more. I would probably come again just to give it another shot. Maybe during a time when they didnt just open...maybe the food needed time to marinate longer?   The best part about our meal was our 1.99 kirin beer, my fusion edamame (which was a small bowl for almost 4bucks), and my husband's Tako (small bowl.for almost 4 bucks). We spent 55 bucks, which I walked out wishing we had just went to an AYCE sushi for even less.   I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant, and it being well ventilated. There were a couple times our waiter lagged in service. We were nearly done eating by the time he brought our beer out. I suppose since this was noon on a weekday, we had nowhere to go...we didn't really care much. Sometimes just laying back and not having the urgency for anything is soothing to the nerves. Aside from that, overall, service was great and super friendly.  Again, I'd have to come back.. maybe less hungry too. Sometimes hunger can change your palate for sure. But for now, I don't feel like I'm missing out on life if I never did return.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly! Just keep the kids away from the pit, aye.",

    "text": "Well, here comes an atypically fuzzy review from me...  I haven't tried Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ until now. It's available back in California and has been open here in Vegas for over a year now, but it never drew my attention until some friends agreed on it as a dinner destination.  We waited until 9:00pm for the start of happy hour (also available all day Mondays and Wednesdays and daily noon-6:30pm) to go. We had a reservation, although it didn't look very busy. The decor is welcoming and the place was very clean, perhaps owing somewhat to self-vacuuming grill helping to keep the restaurant and patrons' clothing free of residual meat smells. I have to confess that I was super tired during the meal in the \"I can't focus on more than one thing\" kinda way, but I really don't remember hearing any music whatsoever being played. Maybe it was soft and drowned out by conversation?  I deferred to someone else for the orders (a la carte of course), and I didn't get so much as a whiff at the receipt, so I won't be able to comment as much on specific dishes as I would like. Our approach ended up being like a \"tasting\" because we shared their portions with five instead of just two or three, so definitely don't be afraid to duplicate orders in larger groups.  Miso soup ($0.99 happy hour, $1.95 regular): it's a standard miso soup, but even in the small bowl, it's a relative bargain during happy hour. Get it if you don't flat out hate miso soup.  Gyu-Kaku Salad ($5.50 HH, $6.50 reg): I don't even wanna know what the half order looks like. Even considering our modest split, the portion seems small, and the dish isn't especially memorable even though it was good at the time. Skip this.  Fried Chicken Karaage ($3.95/$4.95): this is actually one of several dishes that are even more deeply discounted during \"Super Happy Hour\" after 11pm, but no way were we waiting that long. It was the best appetizer that I sampled tonight, and the rich creamy sauce is balanced out by a squeeze of lemon.  Fried Calamari ($4.95/$5.95): skip this. The squid was boring and slightly rubbery. There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a pricier, less impressive version of the karaage since it comes with the same sauce and lemon.  Pork Gyoza Dumplings ($3.50/$4.95): also a skip. It's good but unmemorable to a similar extent as the salad.  Corn w/ cheese ($3.95): pretty good, maybe not worth the price. I love corn, but you start to question your sanity with these prices for veggies. That's part of the appeal of AYCE joints, which this is not an example of - you feel like you can still get your veggies while maintaining value. But on that note, I would get the zucchini ($2.95) again, and if I go for Super Happy Hour, I'll most likely get the normal corn at $1.99.  I won't pretend to know all of the meats that I had, especially considering that my friend ended up cooking and distributing everything (on that note, not posting any grill meats photos), but I'm absolutely certain that the Toro Beef (\"beef bacon\" for $3.95/$4.95) was a rockstar dish, and I'm sure the Yaki-Shabu (beef chuck roll, same price as the previous item) and Angus Beef Ribs (ditto on price) were also delicious. Although ponzu and spicy sauce (separately or in combination) will probably be your mainstays, I believe the beef ribs were the one that somehow worked especially well with the sweet soy sauce. Just be sure to rely on the sauces to fill out the flavor because this ain't no Korean BBQ joint.  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though. Duck breast ($6.95/$7.95) and beef tongue w/ scallion sauce ($8.95) were both notably underwhelming. Actually, I don't even remember amidst the confusion which piece was the duck breast. As for the beef tongue, the meat itself was fine, but the scallion sauce didn't do much for me. Maybe I expected it to be a little more cooked and buttery, but it just seemed raw (but how do you cook it on a wire mesh?) and therefore out of place.  Lastly, dessert was a bit of a downer. The macaron ice creams were decent but not worth the $5. I liked the green tea ice cream inside a strawberry shell, and also the mango. I didn't enjoy the taro shell w/ vanilla as much.  All in all, I enjoyed most of the meats, and happy hour pricing was pretty nice, so I would consider trying Gyu-Kaku again. It's a change of carnivorous pace from the KBBQ places.",

I gave it one star for the atmosphere which was spacious and had an Asian yet contemporary design, lighting was perfect for dining and also dim enough for intimacy.  I gave one star for the service which was excellent; our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  I give one star for the prices. We had a satisfying sized portion lunch special with variety at a very decent price of $12.95.  One star for the quality of food. The miso soup was the standard of tofu and a little green onion but it was done right - not too salty. The salad had a nice dressing that was light. The portion of rice was perfect and cooked just right. The meats that we grilled were excellent and quality and flavor. The dining experience itself will bring me back more than once and so that is my final star!!",

Bomb  Vegetables: Shishito Peppers - Can't go to a Japanese BBQ joint and not order shishito peppers...that's like declining chips & salsa at a mexican joint. Asparagus - There's gotta be veggies somewhere..  BBQ Beef: Filet Mignon - Cut was good, very juicy New York Steak - One of the tables favorite choice Bistro Hanger Steak - Not bad very simple Angus Beef Ribs - It was cool Harami Skirt Steak - One of the tables favorite choice Kalbi Short Ribs - Pretty good  Everything we ordered was delicious, cook time is simple and the staff lets you know how long you should cook each item for. The great thing is you leave without the smell of meat on your clothes like them Korean BBQ joints.  Trendy type of atmosphere, drinks were good, food was good, great deals...it has AKthaBeast's stamp of approval!",

The service, the quality of the meat and the overall experience were always top-notch. The prices were good too.  So when I found out they were opening a Gyu-Kaku here in Vegas I was pretty stoked. The Korean BBQ places are a good substitute but not the same. I've been a few times since the opening and have always found the food to be good and the service is on point too. I usually make reservations to be safe but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes when I just walk in for dinner.  For whiskey fans they have a good selection of Japanese whiskys at the bar and the prices are good too. Bartender told me that their price on Hibiki is the lowest in the valley. I can't verify that but it was low enough for me to throw back a couple of glasses before dinner without thinking twice.  Gyu-Kaku doesn't do AYCE in Vegas (I don't think they do it in CA either) but they have some great meal plans that will bring out enough meat and veggies to where you will be full when you are done. Its more expensive than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ places, but you are paying for quality here.",

I had the spicy miso wings which were $5 bucks for 4 wings... FOUR wings?... wth!!! Well my friend told me there is better items on the menu so who knows I might have to redo my review. 2/5   Service was great our bartender Roma was attentive and nice! 5/5  Also if you are looking for craft beer.. the choices are very very slim here.  AYCD is worth it for sure!",

The service here is always great. When there's a rush, servers always  apologize for the delays and hold up a conversation. Totally understandable.  Asian sangria is also my fav here. I have yet to try the reef with calpico.  The smores at the end of the meal is always pleasant but I feel like the main reason I come to gyu kaku is for the lady m crepe haha",

I always get a variety of meats one of which is the Toro beef. That specific meat cooks from 45 seconds a side. Well guess what, all the meat were taking more than 3 minutes to brown. Everything we had on the table cooked for such a long time. I was so mad, to top it off the garlic noodle served on that day was bland.   After the meal I asked a different server if our grill was faulty (usually they change the burnt grills at least two times whenever we dine here).  We finished and the grill top wasn't even burnt. He said,  yeah this booth specifically had trouble heating.   The fact that we could've relocated to a different table when you knew that the one we were sitting at was faulty. I would normally give a 5 Star rating. I still love going to this place and I will eventually update my review to a five star since majority of your staff are really nice. Just venting out.",

She didn't even greet us for 5 minutes of standing there. Seemed like she did the same with the people that were standing in front of us. She kept walking by and never said anything until she was ready to take our name. That was, \"how many?\"  We were sat after 30 minutes to a very sticky table. Sticky menus, sticky sauce bottles.  Everything was sticky. It was pretty gross. I felt the need to wash my hands 4 times.  For $100 dinner, this was ridiculous. The prices should be much cheaper for the quality and the cleanliness alone.   I had been here before and it was much better. Not sure if there is new management or what. But it was no bueno.",

But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they needed to be cleaned.  So we're seated, looking at the amazing choices on menu. We make our choices pretty quickly since we're pretty hungry. We sat there for 20 minutes without a single person offering us drinks or if we're ready to order. There were multiple servers walking back and forth passing our table and they literally wouldn't look at us.

The quality of the meat was good and had a lot of flavour. The grill had a nice ventilation system so that you're not coming out smelling like BBQ. I paired the selections of meat with a glass of Pinot Noir, and that combination went well together!  Customer service was great! Our server, Yoshi, was very attentive. Waters were refilled accordingly.  They have an app where you can scan your receipt for points which eventually lead to rewards (screenshot below).

The interior is sleek and comfortable.  The food is of decent quality, and the combo we ordered came with enough food to feel full. Prices were not horrendous.

If we were told ahead of time we probably wouldn't have stayed. First few times we ordered are the big highlights on the menu, but not available?? Premium New York steak garlic? No. Kalbi Chuck Rib Tare Sweet soy? No. Garlic shoyu ribeye? No. Toro beef tare sweet soy? No.   We had a lot of the pork belly and bistro hanger steak but it was quite disappointing that so many items were out. The table next to us felt the same way. Why are we paying full price if the menu isn't available.",

    "text": "This was our first time here. It reminds me of Gangnam bbq. Very similar. They have sets with different meats and appetizers. We ordered the premium happy hour course. There were 4 of us so we ordered a few a la carte items that were not part of the course meal including the bistro hanger steak, yaki-shabu beef, toro beef, and New York steak. All the meat tasted so good. We especially liked the harami miso skirt steak which came with the course so we ordered it again. It was very tender and full of so much flavor. The appetizers were just okay, not good or bad. We would probably just order the meats separately without the appetizers. The dessert s'mores were pretty good. Also, they had 3 different sauces for your meat: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy. They were all good. The service was really good. Overall, 5/5 for food minus the appetizers, 5/5 for service.  Also, we found out recently that they now have all you can eat bbq. We're definitely going to try it next time.",

We spent over 60 dollars at the bar waiting to be seated. The hostess started talking back when we asked what the hold up was. She said \"it's the fucking kitchen, they're behind\". Not necessary: When we asked to speak with the manager after that, him and the hostess both had an attitude. The hostess was talking back to us, very unprofessional.  It was my friends birthday and we are very upset about this experience. I used to love this place and sadly, I don't know if I'll ever come backs",

Everything cooks in about 1.5 minutes per side.  I've tried all the red meats, the shrimp, the salmon, and even the chicken.  Take my advice and skip the chicken.  The rest is pretty good and my favorite is their hanger steak.  Each serving of their hanger steak is about 3 oz., it's a little thin, but marinated just right for my taste.  Price for dinner is comparable to the rest of the Asian BBQ places out here.  Happy Hour is a couple bucks off their dinner prices.  In my opinion, you get the most out of your money during lunch when the prices are almost half off.  9 oz. of meat for around $10??  Sold!!    2017 Yelp Review #9",

First of all, I noticed that the amount of the gyu-kaku salad was less compared to what I remember. Secondly, I forgot which meat but it was seasoned very salty. Another thing, when we got our s'mores the marshmallows were dry and a little hard. Lastly, service wasn't as good as I remembered. When I told our waitress about the marshmallows she just snatched the marshmallows from me and didn't even say anything. She gave us new ones but they were like the same. In my opinion, this place has gone down a bit with food and service.",

We got the meat lovers and a side of garlic mushrooms, and we left satisfied and full. Our server (I didn't hear her name) was very friendly and helpful with explaining the menu, since it was our first time here. I think this place is good for date nights and lunch/dinner with family. I'm taking one star out because the music was a little too loud, and a lot of their sauces had MSG- which isn't a biggie, but we do try to avoid it as much as we can. It was also really cold in there. Maybe they keep the temperature low because of the BBQ grills?   We would definitely go back to try their other items on the menu. Hopefully, the music won't be as loud next time.",

Fransicso came by and cleared our table when ever we were done with our plate. This entire experience is something you don't get often and with Jarrett we did!   We wanted to let the manager know how amazing Jarrett was, he was no where to be found and when we asked for the manager, he was too busy, his bartender said that it would take him some time. It made us feel like we were not important enough for him to come speak with us.   We want to make sure that Jarrett and Fransicso know that we appreciate them for their wonderful service!",

The air vent is in the grill so you won't leave smelling like BBQ.   So ordered off the hour and regular menu. Most of the meats were overly marinaded and sweet. Which I didn't like. I really liked the harami and kalbi. The Kobe style flat iron steak was very dry. It was like a dried carne sada without the marinade.   We also order a full house salad which was very small for the price $5.50. The cheese corn was good but SERIOUSLY felt skimped on corn. It was only like 2 tablespoons in the foil for $5?   We got s'mores at the end and that was fun to eat! I would def recommend only ordering off happy hour And you'll leave more satisfied.",

This location is on par with its peers in NYC, and perhaps even a little bit better, as some of the appetizers we got were a larger portion than what we get in Manhattan.  Service was great and friendly, as usual.  Pleasantly surprised we could get the Lady M mille crepe here! It is a dollar more, but hey, shipping from NYC, so whatever.

    "text": "Food was amazing!  Loved the gyu-kaku course (on weekends it's 20% off as well). Loved all the components especially the rice pot it came with and all of the meats, maybe minus the chicken but I'm a bit biased of chicken at any Grill place. It never tastes quite right.    We also got the bacon wrapped asparagus and the kobe duo which were both so worth it.  If I could do it over I would have just seared the meat on both sides, quality of meat was great and is best rare.  Also we didn't use any sauces which is saying something.  Everything was seasoned so well.    If we didn't get the course we never would have tried most of the things we loved so highly recommend it especially for first timers like us!  Service was great, Yoshi was very nice and helpful.",

Except for that one time I didn't have a reservation and it was packed, but never mind that. You can actually place a reservation online and it was totally hassle free. I changed the number of people so many times throughout the day and they still accommodated to it. Big plus.   I am a HUGE meat eater. I love eating beef so this place was totally made for me. Everything we have ever ordered was all delicious. My boyfriend and I always order from their 2 for whatever meals. It is a ton of food. It's more than enough for two. It comes with an array of different appetizers and marinated meats. AND with s'mores to end the meal. Recently they started serving macaron ice cream sandwiches. Uh hello yes please!   The only con about this place would probably be slow service sometimes. It's like why is it taking so long for raw meat to get to our table. Are they slaughtering the cow fresh to order or what? Besides that I can actually overlook that because the food is worth the wait.",

The prices ended up being pretty comparable. Roughly $30-$40pp spent. Favorite items were the Kobe steak, and beef tongue. Garlic rice was good, but would prefer white rice since the meat items you're eating it with is already salty. The garlic rice was too much flavor to eat with seasoned meat. They also sell Lady M green tea cake here shipped from NYC. The fresh NYC version is better, but this is not bad. It just doesn't cut thru the layers as well as if you got it in lady m shop from the source.",

We tried their meal for 2 people $45 on happy hour. For starters: edamame, miso soup,assorted appetizers, salad and rice. For BBQ items are hanger steak, shrimp garlic,chicken basil, garlic mushroom and for dessert you get s'mores. I like their A la carte menu and we orderd fried bacon chips and Ahi poke. Unlike Korean bbq there are no assorted sides. The server comes and let you know how long it takes to cook for each items. Overall they were tasty and the service was good.  The ambiance is pretty and the place is clean. I would love to come back and try more of their Ala carte.",

    "text": "I've been here multiple times since it's my favorite BBQ spot in Vegas. Love, love, love the atmosphere since I'm really into restaurants with a modern, upscale social vibe that plays house music (kinda specific, I know).  Don't walk in expecting to become super full unless you have a small stomach or are ready to shell out some money! I think around $20-25 per person would be good to adequately fill someone up. I always /have/ to get a bowl of rice in order to help fill me up when I usually don't get one,  For the appetizers, my favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke, Spicy Tuna Volcano, & Wakame Seaweed Salad. It's been a while since I've had the Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna, but I remember that I definitely enjoyed those the most. Out of all of the meats I've tried, the Toro Beef & the Harami Miso Skirt Steak are definitely my favorites. The Harami definitely has the most flavor out of the ones I've tried. Honestly, all the meats are packed with a lot of flavor; however, I remember the New York Steak not being too special for me. If I had to suggest meats for first timers, get the Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon.  The price is a little too high for me with the portions that are given for each item, but the quality is definitely there. They also provide sweet soy, spicy, and ponzu sauces for your meat, but you don't really need it since you don't have to worry about the meat not having any flavor.  I can't see myself going to Gyu-Kaku unless it's during Happy Hour since the price/portion ratio seems a little off to me. Kudos for having a Gyu-Kaku app to collect reward points to redeem for future visits! Definitely scan all of your receipts every time you go here since every little point counts. Every time I go back, I always get a free Toro Beef since I keep scanning my receipts from the last visit.",

You either have a server on top of it or a server with missing and forgotten orders ... there's never an in-between.  Recently though, came to have dinner with my mom on 5/3/15, and was seated at a table with an obnoxious party next to us separated by one of their dividers. Two blonde chicks were loud, irritating, and wholly inappropriate (they were grabbing at each other's underwear). My mom was crazy uncomfortable and the Gyu Kaku store manager was sitting with them kicking it like nothing they were doing was outrageously inappropriate.  So like, have a one star review.

On weekdays, you can order 2 BBQ meats for $9.95, and it comes with miso soup, salad, and rice. Not bad! Also, the staff will give you tips on how to cook your meat and ensure you enjoy your food.

    "text": "Gyu kaku is the largest yakiniku chain to arrive in americaland and they set a pretty decent standard of what a yakiniku experience would look and feel like in Japan.   A tip for the Noobs:  You can have the meat marinated and prepared any way you want. I you just say I want the Kalbi. they will just bring you whatever they have done or just the plain cut. I think that most ot the people with marginal reviews here are because the reviewer did not know how to pick the meat.  My favorite meat/sauce combinations are: Kalbi miso Harami miso Garlic sirloin Toro beef gochujang Kalbi gochujang  If you aren't sure on the meat/sauce combo, then the best course is to order a set. I will be honest and say I'm not a fan of the prepared foods that come with the meal sets. The chicken karaage and cheese gyoza are just meh: fried fillers. The sushi is not anything special and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm here for meat not sushi. I don't expect Jiro level sushi but it's still mediocre even for American west coast standards.   Their happy hour is probably one of the best in town especially the late night super happy hour (red prices on the menu).  Gyu-Kaku is now the de facto place to go for Japanese yakiniku in Vegas. Go for the meat and beer and nothing else.  Eat with confidence.",

The meats were delicious, except for the NY Steak, that one didn't have much flavor and was very chewy. The bistro and other meats were yummy. The side dishes are nice, but I recommend getting mostly meat if you want a fuller meal. Even with happy hour, these dishes are pretty small and they do add up.   Our waiter wasn't that great, he put the stove up too high and didn't check up on us if we needed refills or wanted to order more. We had to wait for another waiter to come around.   All in all it's a good place to eat if you want tasty food and are also on a budget. Would definitely go again!",

She has an awesome personality & sweet smile. I would love to have her as my waitress every time I go to Gyu-Kaku. We bought the LivingSocial voucher where you can spend $30 on food + drinks. Before we ordered we told Soo please let us know if we ordered too much. After everything we ordered, it was the perfect amount of food for two people.  For starters, we ordered cheese wontons, demi burger bites & sweet potato fries. They're currently doing a special promotion (Enkai Festival) from November 1-January 5 where the bistro hanger steak, rib eye steak and shrimp garlic are $5 each. We ordered all three of those dishes. For the entree we ordered garlic rice bibimbap, duck breast and spinach garlic. Ended dinner with a Taiyaki Ice cream.",

All courses are 20% off on the weekends so that helped.   Everything in that course was not bad esp when dipped in either sweet soy sauce, chili or ponzu sauce. The sukiyaki bibimbap was tasty and it was in a very large clay bowl. My coworker's wife got the bacon bibimbap and we all thought it was going to be actual bacon bit but it's actually cubed pork belly, looked really good! Of course she liked it a lot.   The cool thing is that there is an app you can download to get free food. When you get your receipt, you can scan the code or enter in the code displayed at the bottom of your receipt. Every $1 spent is 2 points. You also get a 10% off when you create an account as well as extra 50 points.   The only thing I was bummed about was that I didn't know they had a locals discount until I received an email for Valentine's Day meal courses. Locals get 10% off. I will make sure to let them know next time.   The waiter was also attentive. Always came back to see if we wanted to order anything else or to refill our water.",

    "text": "(11/7/15 Edited)  Service was well, but our waitress had many responsibility to other tables and took a while to oil or grill. We had to ask waiter to do it for us because she took too long. It's understandable, yet when she brought us our meats she did say she was coming back.   This time I decided to get the meal plan because I would save a few bucks $$$, and get to try different appetizers and meats I haven't before. It's great and satisfies my belly! I SUGGEST getting a meal plan then adding more sides or meat, it's a better deal.  I've been here many time but finally found the time to review this place. Gyu-Kaku's meat selection is great and the prices aren't too bad. I like Japanese BBQ because the grills and vents are different from Korean BBQ. When you leave gyu-kaku you won't leave smelling like oily meats. Happy hour deals are awesome!  SERVICE Their service was wonderful, they are knowledgable on the items on the menu. They check if you're doing well with the food and change your grill when needed. The servers also tell you how much time is needed to cook your meat and vegetables.   FOOD Good quality meat but portions not great. My favorite is beef tongue and it comes with small portions unfortunately. They offer spicy, sweet soy, and ponzu sauce. The ponzu sauce goes well with most of the meats (for my preference). Ponzu is citrusy and it's refreshing. The sweet soy seems familiar to Maggie's soy sauce but sweeter. The spicy is a mix of garlic and spices.  CONCLUSION Will be back to try lunch deals!",

Always smiling happy and willing to help us out and do whatever he can to make us enjoy our time! He was very informative, helpful, friendly, and seriously made us enjoy our delicious food even more. I wish that everyone could learn a bit of something from him!!! Waters never went empty. Never went without asking us if we were okay or needed anything. He was truly 5 star service. I wish I could get him every time. Food, in my POV, has also become much better in my eye. Also very good quality compared to other bbq places.",

    "text": "Went here with a party of 6 and we were able to make reservations.  We sat in a combo booth table with two chairs in a corner with one griller. If you like to cook your own food, then this is a place you will like. They tell you how many minutes each requires if you were unsure of how to cook.  We started with some fried potstickers and ahi tuna poke, which were both pretty good.  We order the lots of beef and pork belly.  We cooked our seafood at the end, which were scallops and garlic shrimp.  Also, ordered miso ramen and it was pretty good.  My favorite was the sukiyaki bibimbap in a hot stone bowl.  That was super yummy.  It ended up costing us about $30 a person with all the food we ordered.  The only thing that I was suprised with is that they did an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill and also taxed the gratuity.  I just thought it was odd.  Funny thing is that they have local branches here in the IE and I only heard about it when I went to visit a friend in Vegas. They also offer the macaron ice cream sandwiches for desert.",

Service: 5 star     Passionate and Kind Starters: 5 Star     I love the starters, especially Gyu Kaku salad and     steam dumpling Entrees: 3.5 Star     my boyfriend likes Kobe style beef last time he came, but I would say it was not worth the price, too chewy. The beef tongue was much better than what I had in Tucson, recommended. Teriyaki Bibimbap  was sweet and delicious. Oh, and the grilled salmon, I used to not like cooked salmon in my life, but this one really changed my taste, you have to try it. is Others are just not too good but ok.  Dessert: 4 Star      I am a dessert girl and my Vegas trip is just for those dessert. I have never tried the S'more and it looked delicious in photos, but for me it is too sweet, well but it's fun to grill marshmallow. Lady M is good, I tried it once before.   Overall a 4 star, will not scheduled for my next Vegas travel but will recommend to my friend.",

We ordered beef kalbi, sukiyaki bibimbap, mahi-mahi, shrimp, spicy pork, corn with butter and mushroom medleys. The bibimbap wasn't spicy at all, I requested for gochujang, which is like chilli paste.   Although, we were so full but had to order taiyaki with ice cream. It is waffle with red bean filling and a side of mango ice cream. Lil had to change a new grill to grill it.  In my opinion, the taiyaki was just OK but the mango ice cream was sooo good.",

We were there during happy hour (12-630pm and 9-1230am Tues,Thurs-Sun; all day Mon-Wed), but went w/ the PREMIUM AYCE for $35 because they had more \"low carb\" options (so we're watching a figure, so what?).   Pretty much tried all the meats w/ the exception of the ones w/ any sweet sauces. Favorite cut? Bistro Hanger Steak Miso (21-Day aged angus beef). During this experience, I learned that I don't particularly care for super thinly sliced meat. This was nice and tender and full of flavor. 2nd fave was the garlic shrimp, and the garlic mushroom cooked deliciously on the grill.    Lots of dessert options including s'mores, macaron ice cream sandwich and green tea crepe cake that I wish I could've tried. Service was awesome! Did a great job checking on us, bussing, and asking if we wanted our grill changed every time we ordered.  90min limit is plenty of time to get your food!",

    "text": "I have mix feelings about Gyu-Kaku. Somethings really liked about the place and somethings that in such competitive market of AYCE Korean/Japanese BBQ not work for me. It still one that would go back to but not one that would rave about friends need check out. My cousin wanted to check it out cause heard rave things about it from his friends. It was 45 min wait but that was on par for weekend or Saturday night. We sat at the bar chill over drinks until our table was ready. The bar I was surprise at the drink prices because it was happy hour prices all day on the menu. Nice surprise plus ordered two appetizers to share. The japanese fried chicken and tuna poke. Both pretty good. The fried chicken was basic karage style. It had nice golden crust outside, cooked perfect in the middle, nice moist and hot, and great dish. The poke was interesting it was nice cubes served with chips, diced avocado, and some kind of sauce. Thinking yuzu style cause had citrus acid flavor but overall nice balance of texture and flavor. The bar area not that big but they have nice size widescreen. So it great spot chill over reasonable price drinks, great bar menu food (the appetizers that can order on the regular menu), and watch some sports.   Once we sat down decided to do the all you can eat. We were thinking about doing dinner for two people. Really look at the different meats and the price really save couple dollars your better off going all you can eat. Just me. We got the second option believe they have three different prices can choose. Like other AYCE spots the higher menu option get few more premium choices. We ended up going with the middle price one. All the proteins was solid. I kind of forgot the one that stood out best for me cause after the four round. Protein overload. LOL!!! One thing about most of the meat proteins they were cut super thin. I found it different cause most other places not that super thin. It great in the sense the meats cooks way faster so get more. I think prefer little more thicker cuts. The grill our server got it cranked to start and dam by far the hottest burner used at  korean BBQ. So combination of heat and thin slices times we were not turning the proteins over fast enough get little crispy. They never really changed our grill pad. We found out. The last thing want put new proteins on grill that all char with black stuff from the last round. We asked our server if they changed the grill constantly. Honest found it odd answer. She telling us that customers were getting little irritated asking so often change it. They went on the assumption that if customer not mention anything just going leave it the whole time. Makes no sense. Now I know but told them our first time for both so figure something they would have mention. My next visit make point to get the grill swapped out more. Service was ok. She started off great then once got going forgot couple things ordered. The whole grill thing kind of lost points for service. She nice person, friendly, and all smiles. Just the little things service could have been better for me.   Overall say fan. Just knowing that so many other spots that serve the same concept and others better quality meats. Not sure when the next visit for me. Spot that would hit up again with friends.",

They even changed our grill out halfway through. We really enjoyed our experience in Chinatown (which was pretty close to the one we went to in NYC). Will be back again and hopefully they will have their flavored marshmallows back in by then!",

My favorite was beef tone. It taste so juicy and fresh with lemon. We like the spicy beef bimbimbump but I think it is too spicy for us.   Come here either in happy hour or coupon. Also their fish poke is very fishy.",

    "text": "I would definitely give this place 5 stars if the service wasn't absolutely horrible. My boyfriend and I have been here before with my mom and it was great.. But my boyfriend and I went last night and our second impression was so bad I don't think I'll recommend this place again.   First off, we walk in and there's only 1 party of 3 waiting ahead of us. The host tells us it's an HOUR wait.. Again, mind you there is ONE party ahead of us and a bunch of tables open. Maybe I'd understand if I saw that it was busy and they were short staffed but nope, every person I saw working looked like they had plenty of time for an extra table and didn't even ask if we were helped because we were waiting for SO long (over an hour to be exact). We had to constantly ask the host when we were going to be sat because she never checked in with us. We were the only people waiting at this point with over 6 tables open, yeah we counted because we had THAT much time. At one point we asked how much longer and she really said \"I have to call the reservations and see\"... I worked as a host in a high end restaurant on the strip, this was highly unprofessional and a horrible working of a host. We got there at 8:20pm, she said they have reservations.. We waited until about 9:40 to get sat and only ONE reservation walked in that whole time so what was the point in making us wait that long?   To make this yelp review even better, we literally saw two of the workers take shots with their friends who were dining in. Is that why our food took over 15 minutes, maybe even longer, each time we ordered? It's raw I don't see why it would take this long and also our server did not have any other tables. So is that why our server forgot multiple times to bring out what we ordered? Is that why it took so long to get sat? Because your employees are drinking on the job?   All in all, the food is amazing but the service is not even worth the expensive or the high cost. Luckily our server discounted the bill due to how long everything took but none of what we experienced was acceptable. I really hope they re-train their employees on proper customer service. Definitely needs work.",

One of the best happy hours all around in my opinion. Not just for alcohol, but the few dollars that you save on plates adds up in the end if you have an appetite like me.  They have 30 ounce Sapporo and Asahi drafts. Literally the mugs are as big as my head. Also other favorites like a lychee martini. This really isn't a place you come to drink like one of the local bars but the mixed drinks always hit the spot.  We started off with the cheese wontons. Always a good choice but remember to eat them fast. You don't want them sitting around too long for the cheese inside goes from gooey goodness to cardboard. 5/5  We also went with the fillet. You save about two dollars during happy hour. And the New York steak. Both extremely good quality. 5/5  We also had the sukiyaki bimbimbap (I think that's how you spell it. Comes in a large cattle looking bowl. Extremely hot so be careful. For a crispier rice, let it sit in the bowl for a while before you stir and serve. Also a 5/5.  Definitely a good place for friends and family to hang out or if you want to nuzzle up next to your sweetheart it's also a great spot.",

I truly think people are what make or break your visits. I came in for the first time on a casual date,there wasn't a hot up front but did come within a min of standing. The host and server, not to much personable but not bad either.  There is too many things to decide on so we went with a quick ramen and rice bowl. Both of which came out fast and hot! And very tasty. Service was great as far as checking in and quickness. The music was a bit everywhere but not so much of a bother.   I was looking for a better ambience in this place but didn't get that which is why I gave a 3 star.   If you want some yummy tasty food in a cool something to do date this would be recommended.",

We ordered the \"jackpot surf and turf\" course meal. $77.77 altogether for 2 people,  exclusive to Las Vegas. 3 course meal included starters such as a spicy tuna salad, fried calamari, miso and much more..  Main entree included 3-4 styles of steaks: wagyu, skirt steak, and a few more I forgot? Salmon, garlic shrimp.  And dessert we had s'mores.   I wouldn't order the 3 course meal again just because I felt it was a bit over priced. You can definitely order ala carte which is better.  The service was good at first but through the middle to end waitress was hard to track down and this young man by the name of Andrew? catered to us and he wasn't even our server.   I asked another worker(I'm assuming she was a manager) for a refill and extra napkins and she never came back!! Was annoyed about that. But once again Andrew took care of us!!! Good job Andrew!!!!!   I will return.",

So me and my partner decided to sit at the bar. The bar was a mess. There was leftover ramen bowls and plates everywhere. Nevertheless we decided to just put the dirty dishes off to the side of the bar. The bartender then comes to us and wipes the bar. I greeted her and she greeted me back with the same exact greeting I gave her and started laughing( seemed like she was mocking me.) My car keys were on the bar. She took them, wiped the bar then threw my keys on the bar. She just laughed. I didn't think it was funny. She seemed intoxicated because she was taking shots with the customers. Then we were deciding to get something to eat from the bar. She over heard mr and said \"If you guys wanna order food just wait  be seated coz I'm closing the bar soon.\" Only to find out the bat doesn't close till 12?! Then a couple sat at the bar and I could see her rolling her eyes coz she got new customers. I just ended up leaving and it just ruined my night to be honest. I get it you're tired and you wanna leave soon but I work in the industry and will never treat customers like that. Customers bring the business they should be taken care of with quality service.",

I had three sets of dirty tongs as well before I found a clean set. Overall the place was dirty, the windows were filthy and it just had that feeling of grime everywhere. The best thing that the \"manager\" was able to do was a 15% discount!! 15% was $5 dollars off!! Not worth my time to have pulled him aside! This was my first time at this location and my wife said that to So-Cal location was so much better! I do not think that I would return!

Great selection of meats, thinly sliced and some are small steak bites and they have poultry and seafood for grilling as well. My absolute favorite is the Toro Beef Either white or sweet soy and the pork belly is amazing on the grill! First time I had thinly sliced beef tongue on the grill and it was amazing! I was afraid but the taste was amazing. The miso skirt steak and the garlic soy prime rib are to die for! You can't beat their lunch specials where you can pick 2-3 meats to grill and it comes with a salad, miso soup and rice for $9.95 or $12.95. And you can upgrade your rice to sukiyaki Bibimbap for $3 and believe me it is a MUST TRY!!!  we found Gyu-Kaku in San Diego and they had a AYCE special which was great for first timers to try a little bit of everything! Sadly the Las Vegas location doesn't have AYCE...YET! But they do have extended hours for 'Happy Hour' where they have discounted food & drinks! If going for dinner you will need to make reservation 2 hours in advance if possible. Our server today, Shane, was on point! He kept my hubby glass full, answered all of my questions and was very attentive and upbeat. Great service! I did advise the hostess that it took us 15mins of calling straight for someone to answer.",

There is a lot of Asian flare to it and I felt like I was in another country because of it. The prices during reverse happy hour are a steal to me. I got cabbage kimchi and hanger beef with a drink for only $9. The kimchi was amazing and so was the meat! I love that you cook your own meat to your liking but it already comes seasoned. The flavor station for the meat is a great addition too! Go with the sweet sauce! I've only been here once but I can't wait to go back!",

He was very pleasant and was attentive.   I took off 1 star for the restaurant in general not this one specifically. It seems like every time I go the portions get smaller and the food just seems to be made with a declining quality while getting more expensive.   The spicy sauce is probably my favorite sauce from anywhere ever which is why I always find myself back here.",

The dressing on the salad had a funky taste. And the tuna poke that was served was just a grainy texture in my mouth. Plus the onions they had as a garnish were sour. The chili dumplings were only luke warm but the sauce was good. The meat was so so and the cheese sauce that was served with the broccoli was way to oily and wouldn't even stick when dipped. As for the service, it was very pleasant. The hostess greeted us right away and so did the server. Sorry but $70 is just not worth it.",

We ordered beef tongue.Normally the rule in Japan when someone order beef tongue, We eat first before another meat.while the pan is still <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fclean.so&s=a00f7cddf9f47a2edeba91544b558e58f846512d92f70c0f6fadd91f589d3afb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">clean.so</a>,we can enjoy them with juice of lemon. We went to there twice.  Both time, they brought another meats before the beef tongue. Even last time who served us was Japanese server. He didn't bring tongue first.That Japanese server was always talking with another customer who looks his friend and busy talking and we couldn't be served when we needed to ask something . The rice was sooooooo hard.I usually want to enjoy the bbq with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frice.So&s=c86ae490b70c23ca4cd4ce45049ba8bbdae42d554606a64ad36795efe95e3cba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rice.So</a> we don't need to order a lots of meat and we can stay healthy. But with that hard rice we had hard time. I Also have 1 year baby she can't eat super hard rice.  So I asked if i can change to the another  rice but he told me he can't. But he told me he can put the microwave again. I didn't know that first rice was microwaved.I don't like microwaved rice.  Also he microwaved till hard <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frice.It&s=fdc1de2c9803d1108ecf1a80d971976efef753de5c3dc3ba5e761c19c1c5203d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rice.It</a> makes rice more dry. I finally asked hot water to put on the rice to make soft. That was not totally my way to eat bbq.I couldn't enjoy this Yakiniku at all. Finally he didn't charge the rice when I explain that I couldn't enjoy without rice. And I said it wasn't his fault. That is the owner's fault who doesn't know what is the rule for yakiniku(bbq).They just want to make money with pricy price.I feel this owner is not honest. I will not come back there until owner change completely his or her mind.I want to tell you Gyukaku in Japan is totally different so please go to Gyukaku in Japan or another franchise Gyukaku.I don't recommend this Gyukaku.Thank you!!!!",

We truly enjoyed our dinner everything tasted delish..and we didn't come out smelling like bbq. Which is Aweosme CuZ whenever we do Korean BBQ, I swear that smell sticks to your clothes for days. Love the beef selection from the beef tongue to the shabu meat I think that's what they called the thin sliced beef. To the apps and Serts.. Which came with karage and s'mores, I'll definitely come back specially that they have a reverse happy hour.",

Huge fan of it while I was living in Hawaii so you can only imagine the excitement from all the Hawaii transplants in the Valley when this place opened!  Menu is pretty similar with some of my favorites missing, including the grilled mochi and douyaki.  They did however, to my surprise, Lady M Green Tea Crepe Cake!  Say whhhhhaaatt?  Yes!  However, I found it is still better fresh from the bakery itself.    Anyways, the prices are about the same, no AYCE at this establishment, unlike the other ones in SoCal, but you are paying for the quality of the meat!    We did order a bunch of the appetizers, which were quite enjoyable!  No disappointments from our dinner.",

No staffs were in the front, napkins, trash on the tables and chair from last night, employee were cleaning the floor, sauce on the chair which was stick on our pants, as the chair was black so we couldn't recognize it, thanks God ours were black pants. Most of their appetizers were not my type, but bacon chips. We had been tried almost all of them, that's why i can say that. The flavors were not tasty at all, I'm serious. Bacon chips were great, but today it weren't crispy and tasteless, they're even stick to each other so they're like boiled bacons. Meat were great, but they're too slow. When I wanna cancel my round 2 order since the rest time was so long, they appeared. We both agreed that we should stop going here.",

    "text": "Great spot to eat, drink, and hang out.  Environment: The outside of the restaurant can be a little misleading in the sense that the area isn't that great and the building looks kind of small on the outside, however, upon entering it is totally different. The interior is clean and trendy, with a lot of walls breaking up the restaurant which is nice in the sense that it makes wherever you are seating feel a little more private without being cramped. They also do have seating on the lower level of the restaurant which is part of the reason that it looks so small from the outside. Additionally, the music they play is very trendy and current which I appreciated.  Food: First off, their happy hour is great. They have it every day at reasonable times and deals on basically everything from appetizers, to meat, and to the drinks. For drinks, they have various beers on draft, both Japanese and domestic, and their jumbo hot sake are great and HUGE. Food-wise I got a couple small appetizers, namely the spicy tuna volcano and the fried calamari. When ordering the meats, they usually come in small portions which allows you to try everything you want before you get full. A couple of my favorites were the miso steak, beef tongue, and bacon-wrapped scallops. Everything was very favorable.   Service: Service was very good as well. Our server Haena was very nice and informative and was very good about checking up on us. She was consistently getting us refills on drinks, changing our grill for us, and letting us know about how much time each item we were grilling would take before it was ready to eat.   Overall I will continue coming here, and would recommend it to anyone craving Japanese food.",

    "text": "I like Gyu-Kaku for various reasons.  Sure, it's a chain and all but they have one of the best happy hours ever!  Happy hours - All Day on Mondays and Wednesdays!  That alone makes this a great place to visit! They also have early happy hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 12 pm to 6:30 pm and late happy hour (reverse happy hour) on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 9 pm to 12:30 am.  Even with happy hour, you can still drop a pretty penny because there's a lot to order.  I love their cocktails and the beer is a great price too!  My go to items are (give or take): Edamame (free with FB like), Fried Calamari, Kim-Chee Tofu, Spicy Tuna Volcano, Steamed Chili Dumplings, Fried Bacon Bits, Fried Japanese Tofu, Pork Gyoza Dumplings, Toro Beef, Horumon Intestine, Beef Tongue, Pork Belly, Pork Toro, Shrimp Garlic, and Mushroom Medley.  Their rewards program is pretty awesome!  If I'm not getting free food, I'm getting money off the bill. Who is going to complain about that?  They recently added an all-you-can-eat option: $15-$20/pp children (ages 6-12); $30-$40/pp adults and $20-$27 seniors (age 60 and up).   This is a fun place for groups, although you can easily run out of space at your table.  I like that they make a big deal out of birthdays!  Love places that put that little effort in!  (Hence, that's why I'm going tonight!)  Service is pretty good for the most part.  You have energetic individuals coming around to get your orders in and food out.  It's a bit frustrating to have reservations every time I go, but still have to wait an additional 10-15 minutes since the table is never ready.  (Not ideal when you have kids in tow.) Surprisingly, I didn't have to wait the last time but I have had to in the past.  But most importantly, the kids enjoy this place and will eat quite a bit while there.  As a result, that makes for two very happy parents.",

After we were done and asked for our bill, our waiter passed it to me and I found something weird. First, they changed my baby with $26 kid's fee but their menu said  kids under 6 years old are free. My baby is normal size and only 2 years old. I don't know how they cannot recognize the difference between a 2 years old baby and a 6 years old toddler. Second, they directly charged us 18% gratuity for party of six adults but we only had five adults and one baby. Third, they will changed you extra sales tax. In Las Vegas, the rate of sales tax is 8.25% and they changed me 9.7%, I found something wrong about the sales tax and asked them to explain. Their manager told me in Las Vegas that city not only charges sales tax but also food tax but I am not if charging extra \"food tax\" is normal here ,because I am a Californian l. I will ask State Board of Equalization in Nevada to figure out if if it's right. I don't know why they are doing this to us, just because we are looked like fucking tourists. If that is what they thought, I have to say sorry to them because their plot failed. Please see the photo of my receipt and you will know how dishonest the restaurant is.",

When we lived in Seattle this would be our must-stop restaurant during vacations in L.A. - every visit! Now that we live in Las Vegas and they opened one here, we're in Heaven. Go for happy hour. The garlic noodles are one of the priciest but best things on the menu, must order! Vegetarian and meat-lover friendly. I introduce everyone to this place.",

At first I was a little unclear on how to order, but the waiter cleared it up for us. They have cooked food and food you grill yourself.  I ordered the filet mignon to grill. All of us ordered something from the menu that was cooked and that we had to grill ourselves.   Inside is very trendy. In today's world with people on cell phones 24/7, it was great to be at a restaurant where you couldn't be on the phone because you had to cook your own food! Lol. None of us were on the phone (except to take some photos) and had fun-n-silly conversations.   I had a great time.",

Just bring us raw meat... didn't get the all you can eat full feeling I was looking for.  What saved the restaurant was the good happy hour drinks, and the smores for dessert!",

You definitely cannot beat the prices. Martinis for $4, large sake for $6 and tons of food options. It also was very easy to schedule a reservation even for 6 of us.   The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star would be the slow service. This could be partially our fault since we were cooking the meat but the whole meal took about three hours to completely finish. I don't recommend coming here on a time crunch.  Overall it was very good and I'd definitely be back again for another happy hour.",

    "text": "Gyu-Kaku is an classy Japanese BBQ restaurant with great service, a fantastic happy hour, and mid range prices.  For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.    I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.    We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!  Overall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner.",

We were told that we had to sit down and order it, and we get the 90 min for our $30 all you can eat. Nice! So we wait, patiently. Get seated and ask for a booster, 20 min go by and my toddler is swinging around in the restaurant making me not even want to eat there anymore!!! But i stay patient. No booster, no waters, no server! Then, when our server does come we get told 1. There are NO KID MENUS!!! I have 5 kids so this is important to me. I was getting up to leave. And i ask to speak to a manager who by the way still did not approach me to apologize for any confusion or clarification.   But my server comes back and tells me that we can do the kid menu. cool, we can do that. So we start ordering again.   Only to find out that we still couldn't do the dang kid menus if we wanted to do the damn $30 all you can eat?!  I left and CALLED this time to speak to a manager. Still NO answer NO CLARIFICATION!  This is by far the worst experience ive ever had. Honestly i don't care if its Christmas -- and that you're busy. You are a restaurant establishment! That is expected to be professional!! And this was nothing of that sort! My family of 7 walked out and left.   This is upsetting on the miscommunication and lack of effort on their side who ended up putting the server in the middle!!! The server is not at fault, to me its the damn manager!!!  Fix your customer service. I work in customer service and i worked on every holiday this year. Doesn't give you an excuse. You chose this industry. If you don't like it? Don't work it!!!",

They have cool samurai decorations and art.  The tables also look like ones in Japan minus the sitting on the floor part.  Both times I came here I went during their Happy Hour later in the evening.  They have a great variety of meats in small portions so it's best to order a few because one order will not fill you up.    All the different meats were really good.  I tried to Kalbi,  New York Steak, and the filet mignon.  All cooked perfectly (because I grilled it duh)  The sides were kind of A mixed between American and Korean dishes.  I ordered the corn and both times they were kinda burned with the directions they gave me.  Also ordered the broccoli and velveta cheese(fondue style) which was great.    The complaints I have about this was the service.  They only had 1 server working for 7-8 tables.  The music was really loud which I usually like loud but not when I'm out having dinner trying to have a conversation with.  Overall it's a cool concept with cooking your own food and the staff giving you directions.  I'd like to recommend making having a timer at the table for customers.  I had to use my phone as a timer but it would of been nice if there was a timer because if you're not paying attention you could burn your food quick.",

As I pulled up to the restaurant I realized that I had seen this place a 100 times or more as I drove by it. It's unassuming, not a hole in the wall, but nothing that ever jumped out to me to pique my interest.  Walking in, I realized this place had been there for a while or at least appears to have. Sitting down at the table I noticed stains on my wife's napkin. This quickly set off all in the party looking at silverware, napkins, table, surroundings. It was dirty, not a place I like to eat at. We were there though and I had a gift card from a Christmas present so we decided to hold our noses and push on. (It didn't smell bad, just using as an expression)  To my delight, the food was all very good. All the meats tasted well and since you cook your own food I would like to give compliments to the chef! We ordered a large array of meats with different seasonings and marinade. I couldn't tell you which one I like the most because they were all truly wonderful. The only thing we didn't enjoy were the garlic mushrooms, they lacked flavor, not what we expected.   The service was okay, we waited at least 25 minutes to get our check and another 10 once she took our cards to pay. This is mostly overlooked because my wife and I enjoyed our friends company. Our waitress did take time to explain menu items and was pleasant.   Overall I would go back, the food was very good. I hope it was a one off with the service and that ownership will take this as a hint that maybe they need to go through their building and do a nice deep cleaning. Serious though how easy is it to not place dirty napkins back on the tables, lazy!  Food - 5 Service - 2.5 Cleanliness - 2 Ambience - 3.5",

    "text": "This place is great.  This is my first real Japanese-based bbq (not the typical Korean ones I go to) and probably the only that can compete with Los Angeles Korean bbqs (not in price, but taste and quality).  I had Kalbi like in the Korean joints, but I also had butterfish and duck as well.  They had this Spicy Tuna Volcano, which is basically spicy tuna on top of a cooked rice ball.  Needless to say, but this place brought my appetite back (stomach virus killed my appetite...).    Their size of their traditional grills was smaller than I would've liked, but it got the job done.  My party was small, so it didn't really make a difference.  I was just a little impatient because I wanted all that food inside me as soon as I saw it.  (Yes, my dream girl would say something similar to this).  If you're in Vegas and you have a desire for Asian food, go to China Town and eat here.  You won't be disappointed.",

The bartender was nice and took the time to answer our questions, and the server (Ryan) was very attentive and thorough with his explanations.   Aside from delicious and tasty meat, the shrimp garlic noodles are beyond scrumptious.  My complaint, which if I asked I am sure it would have been accommodated is that they do not give you separate tongs for the chicken, so you're at risk for cross contamination. But like I said, had I asked I'm sure it would've been accommodated!!!",

    "text": "Situated in a shopping center at the corner of Decatur Blvd and Spring Mountain Rd, it'd be impossible to drive by this place and not notice its entryway especially when lit at night.  Interior was nicely decorated with a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese elements throughout.  Music, on the other hand, can be overbearing as EDM blast through the speakers.  Nonetheless, ambiance is perfect for a date night or dinner with a group of friends.  Haven't really considered of going back to any KBBQ joints since dining at this restaurant for the first time!  Consider it some sort of awakening due to the array of items one can enjoy in such great quality.  No AYCE here but they do offer different full course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 that can easily feed 2-4 people.  They also have Happy Hour specials from 1700-1830 and 2100-closing with several discounted items from the menu.  One thing I'd like to point out is how awesome their grills are.  Small vents actually surround the cooking area which makes the smoke dissipate before it can even engulf guests so they don't end up smelling like grilled meat afterwards.  We usually opt for their meat lover's course which is a great way to sample different cuts of meat in various marinades.  The meal starts out with miso soup and house salad as well cheese wontons and garlic fried chicken.  The spread is then followed by the main entree comprised with six different meat items.  To top it all off, s'mores to end the dinner; grill comes off so guests can toast marshmallows straight on the heat.  Overall, Gyu-Kaku is definitely the better alternative to KBBQ...better yet, a great replacement if I must say.  Top notch food quality and superb customer service.  Can't wait for our next meal in this establishment!  P.S. THEY SERVE LADY M MILLE CREPE CAKES!!  They only offer green tea flavor but oh so worth it!!",

Being first timers, it wasn't until 3/4 into our dinner that I discovered  a flame adjustment valve on the side of the table.  He should have informed us at the outset.   As a result, cooking time was little longer than it should have been, and the meat could have been broiled a little better to our liking.  Seasoning and flavor of the meal was excellent.",

This is similar to the Korean BBQ places near it, and in that sense, the meat was so much better quality here. Every cut of beef, the duck breast, even the shrimp was delicious. The bibimbap was tasty, as were the rest of our food.  We opted to get the $77 course menu for two, but split it 3 ways and ordered a little extra, since their happy hour is before 6:30 or after 9:00.  The restaurant itself was nice, clean, attractive, and the noise level was great. Our waitress was very attentive, always checking on how our cooking was going or if any of us needed refills.  Will definitely be coming back to try more.",

Whether in Chicago, San Diego, or Las Vegas, the taste is amazing and very consistent across the U.S.  Instead of Korean BBQ, our group opted for this because the rest had never had Japanese BBQ.  I was nervous that they would compare it to Korean BBQ too much and not like it, but the majority loved it just as much as Korean.  We agreed that Gyu Kaku is much better for marinated meats.  They have a huge variety of marinated meats and each one taste amazing.  The flavors are strong but surprisingly not too salty.  We got one of the combos for two people and liked everything except the chicken.  We also upgraded to the hot stone bowl beef rice instead of white rice and it was amazing and perfect for my toddler.  It also included ingredients for you to toast your own s'mores for dessert.  Just yum!  We also ordered the Lady M green tea Mille crepe cake and it was heavenly.  I don't usually like green tea anything but this was a fine exception!  The cold cream between the abundant layers of soft crepe was to die for.  No Gyu Kaku where I live so I look forward to the next city that has it!",

They never came and asked if we have been helped or if we needed anything including the gentlemen that told us our quote time as he walked through the bar. Finally a gentlemen came up to us and asked if we are waiting for a table or a bartender and we responded with both as we were for yoshis section only. He got us sat right away. Once we were sat yoshi made our visit so much better.  After their gm left on pregnancy leave it seems like it has taken a toll. The staff isn't polite or as happy. The bathrooms were disgusting.

    "text": "Just came back from the restaurant tonight.  feel like sharing my experience with people.  The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first \"Japanese\" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go.",

    "text": "We were thoroughly impressed with our visit to Gyu Kaku. The dinning section was very clean with a traditional Japanese decor. The large bar area looked well stocked and very modern with several flat screen TVs showing a variety of sports. It looks like they also have several large private rooms for parties or business meeting too.  I'm a meat eater and ordered several dishes including: Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon. My wife had the chicken and several vegetable dishes including her favorite, garlic beans. Everything we ordered tasted great! I love the fact that we were able to physically control how well done we want our food cooked.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. The prices were all very reasonable, especially considering the upscale vibe to the place and the novelty of getting to grill your own food right at the table.  Hands down this was the best Japanese BBQ restaurant that we've been to anywhere. It's our new favorite restaurant!",

It melts in your mouth!!) hanger steak, filet mignon, pork belly and cream corns!! The portion was smaller than all the all you can eat BBQ restaurants because they ONLY use high quality meat and marinated them with their homemade sauce.. If you value quantity over quality then this is definitely not the place for you :-( they also serve Lady M cakes!! It is a must try dessert at gyukaku ;-) Enjoy !!!! Xoxo",

Courses are the way to go. We got meat lovers for myself and my husband. Our son took part in it too, and we all were stuffed. S'mores for dessert seemed a little odd, but after all it made sense. There's a fire pit in front of you so why not, right? We brought some friends who were new to this concept of cooking your own food at the table thing lol but they enjoyed themselves, I think.",

And then this place popped up that was open late and I'm very glad that my family and I made a choice to eat here. If you're a real one like me, you'd also choose the premium AYCE. Which comes with a better selection. Starting off the dumplings with chili oil and the karaage were an instant banger. We then kept ordering beef after beef and was highly impressed with the quality of the food. Already I was leaning towards Japanese bbq than Korean.  I really hope someday we can have one of these back in AZ.  Definitely recommend this place if you're tired of Korean bbq (like me).    #CERTIFIEDBANGER",

The floor plan is pretty cool, and they seem to have a good amount of room. All of the employees were very nice, and greet everyone as they are seated. Our group ordered the Premium All You Can Eat option, which give plenty of choices. The quality and flavor were very good! The grills were probably pretty standard, but the seemed a bit small. A good size for two people, but I feel they should be a little larger for a four top table. All of the beef and chicken options were very good. Didn't have the shrimp, since one of our group is allergic. I'm sure I'll be back.",

We get the same thing every time and we're told it was changed last October and that's a lie since we have come multiple times since then and received it.  Almost $70 for a meal that the proportions were cut in half. We won't be coming back for a long time.  I am a frequent customer who spends a lot of $ here and always brought friends and family.

I didn't learn my lesson the first the second of third time. I just couldn't wait to get the meat from the grill into my mouth.

That being said Gyu-Kaku has won me over for one of the best if not the best AYCE BBQ places.  We ordered the premium choice which is the cheapest one out of the three. There is a good selection of meats, vegetables, and other appetizers you can choose from. Of course going for the other two options, there would be even more.  The cost is a little pricier than Korean BBQ, but you can taste the quality and differences of meat. Each selection we ordered had a distinct taste from one another. Some of the items we ordered were: Bistro Hanger Steak Miso, Premium New York Steak Garlic, Kalbi Chuck Rib Tare Sweet Soy, Garlic Shoyu Ribeye, Pork Belly Shio White Soy, Garlic Shrimp, Fried Pork Dumplings, Broccoli, Addicting Cabbage Salad, and the Unami Scallion Negi Rice. All recommended.  Service here is amazing. Our server Ryan took care of us. We had the two bigger tables for our party of 19. Our drinks were consistently being filled and our orders were taken accurately. He is also very friendly, personable, and will be able to crack jokes with you!  Be sure to check Gyu-Kaku out for your next AYCE meal, if you haven't already!",

The decor and atmosphere was amazing with lots of seating.Started at the wrong foot when the host totally forgot about us and we had to wait a little longer at the bar than expected.  The food here is okay. Not super stellar. It gets to the point, not much wow factor. For our party of five we decided not to do the AYCE and decided on two orders of the happy hour for 2 ($50) and we were all well satisfied.

We were able to try a ton of different meats, most of which we never would have tried had we ordered them individually. I'm a picky eater and I loved being able to sample a little bit of everything and not feel bad for wasting what I didn't like. Our waiter was so sweet and he made sure to take really good care of us. Our drinks were never empty and he made sure we never had to go looking for him. We cannot wait to come back and bring our friends. This definitely our new go-to date night and special occasion spot.",

I love Harami, but I don't order it here.\"Kalbi Short-Rib\" is delisious and \"Beef Tongue with Scallion Sauce\" is great.And I like \"Yaki-Shabu\" also.

Their HH is not the best value ever as most items were only $1-2 dollars off (not half off like most places).  As soon as we were seated our server brought waters and turned on the grill.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, helpful, friendly, and every time he dropped off a raw item he gave us advice on how to cook it.   . $57.40 got us a gyu salad (half portion), an order of spring rolls, infusion edamame, chicken karaage, garlic rice, white rice, cheesy corn, duck breast, kobe beef, shrimp, and filet mignon.   .  Gyu-Kaku Salad (half portion is $3.95)- Romaine I think with hard-boiled egg, some sort of radish on top (maybe daikon?), red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and a dressing sort of like thousand island.  It was fresh and crispy and I liked it.  .  Vegetable Spring Rolls ($2.99)-Lovely crispy thin wonton wrapper and was served piping hot but unfortunately the inside was total mush.  I would pass on these.   .  Infusion edamame ($3.50)- Cooked well but was swimming in an orange fat and garlic which I was burping up all day.  Although it was tasty, I do not recommend it if you have a sensitive tummy.  .  Chicken Karaage ($2.99) Delicious slivers of dark meat chicken fried to a perfect crisp with an orange mayo-based sauce.  Just get five orders of this and don't share.   . Garlic rice ($3.99) Very large portion but tasted awful to me.  Rice was overcooked and mushy but it was full of raw garlic and piles of sauteed onions.  I would pass on this.  Definitely don't eat this if you have a date because you will not be called for a second date.    . Cheesy corn ($3.95) Maybe 4 spoon-fuls of canned corn and the cheese was missing.  Not impressed.  . Duck breast ($6.95) I wasn't expecting duck at a yakiniku place but it was very fresh and each piece had a nice strip of fat.  It was delicious.   .  Kobe flat-iron steak ($12.95) So tender and delicious.  Nice marbling of fat.  Didn't even need sauce with this one.  Highly recommend.   .  Garlic Shrimp ($5.95) Shrimp were huge and succulent but the garlic marinade was somewhat chemical-tasting.  Did not enjoy.   . Filet mignon ($6.95) 21 day dry aged chunks of filet mignon.  Incredibly tender and delicious, although they really needed some salt or dipping sauce.   .  Everything was tasty and fun but rather expensive and my husband and I spent the next two days in the restroom (SORRY TMI) so either they served us some questionable food or we are just pansies that can't handle their food.  Either way...I'm not goin' back.",

This I feel is very welcoming and gave me that Japanese feel.   The set up, decorations and style was really eye catching as well. The entrance is lit up by rows of lights and the inside reflects how restaurants in Japan are set up like. This definitely is a great place to socialize, cook and eat at the same time.   It did take a little long for someone to come start serving us but it could have been due to how busy they were that night. The servers were friendly and educated us about each meat and entree, they were also very polite.   We ordered 2 courses, since we had a party for 4. One being the Surf Turf Jackpot Course and the Meat Lover's Course. There is a variety of meat that is included. (Filet mignon, Kobe style flat iron steak) and seafood as well (shrimp, salmon). We were able to cook these the way we like it!   The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is because (1) it did take us awhile to get served and there was no inform of sympathy. (2) it was my brother and I birthday, and we were given one birthday hat but no singing ceremony like the others and (3) our check $50 extra due to charging of every single appetizer item when it was suppose to be included in the courses. Luckily we caught that and got that fixed.   However if you're looking to drink, eat and socialize. This is a nice place to do all the above. Something about taking and cooking for everyone just gives me that family feel.",

We had really high hopes for this place considering the yummy looking pictures of meat and appetizers here on Yelp. We tried all the highly recommended items and a few different ones like the liver and duck breast. Unfortunately we were let down bc even though the meats claimed to have different marinades, they all tasted the same.. some even had no taste at all. Thankfully they do have 3 different types of sauces, but we'd rather not mask our meats with tons of sauce to begin with.  I spent $80 for half the amount of meat i would get at an ayce BBQ place. This place is \"alright\", not a place I would come to regularly. Kbbq all the wayyyy",

I tried a chicken and a pork bbq dish to cook and then some mushrooms for the veggie side.  And of course some sake to knock it all down.

Ive recommended this place to many friends and I've taken them here as well, and they tell me they bring their family here too which makes me happy that they enjoy this place just as much as I do.

I understand finding a strand of hair, because hair falls out easily. But a fingernail?! Someone had to have peeled or ripped it off and threw it. It's disgusting and unacceptable. They gave me another drink on the house, although I was a little hesitant to drink it.

My friends/co-workers abd I definitely enjoyed ourselves and we highly recommend this place! Take it from us...we're all concierge.",

So don't waste your money, instead head down the street to MAGAL BBQ.   I always go to Magal, it's my usual spot but today I figured hey why not try something new? Gyu has a great rep in the Los Angeles area so I figured this would be great too. BOY WAS I WRONG.  First off, it was completely empty. Nobody in the dinning area not even a busy night. Took atleast 20 mins to even get a hostess to come greet us. That's a no for me.   Secondly, the server was trash. By trash I mean, a trash can could probably serve me better! Takes our order but isn't even welcoming? Stared at me as I asked for one of the combos and wasn't really personable. Also, he never even came by to check on my table. The only times I saw him was when he brought out the meats and vegetables and that was it. I saw him SO LITTLE I couldn't even point him out in a lineup if I had to. That's a HUGE NO. And lost all my points of ever coming back here.  Thirdly, it took almost 45 mins to even receive the fucking check! My mom was dying of thirst as her cup of tea always empty the entire meal. Unacceptable.   I will NOT be coming here again. I'd rather eat elsewhere where my service and hospitality is valued and not neglected just because it's DIY Korean BBQ. Smfh. I am absolutely disgusted lol.   USE YOUR MONEY AT MAGAL.",

They have a great selection of pre-organized BBQ platters, such as the Meat Lovers and Signature Cuts which were within the $10-12 range and come with appetizers.   Of course they all have the regular sized BBQ meat platters of single meats, a range of appetizers & you cannot beat their drinks.  Will definitely be coming back and trying other things. Service was also efficient and fast, any used plates weren't left on our table for long because they were very quick at bussing.",

Long story short, a 1 year old and a 4 year old with an abundance of energy, and liquids were spilling left and right and high pitched sounds galore. Nonetheless, she was efficient, sincere, and interacted well with the boys. Anyhoo, these type of interactions should never go unnoticed. 5 stars yo... looking forward to the next outing here",

    "text": "Nothing was bad, but nothing was all that good either.  I like all different kinds of food. I had never done this style of table-top grilling before, and so decided to try it out.   I started out with a \"Southern Mai Tai\".  I should have read the menu a bit closer, because it is actually nothing at all like a Mai Tai. It tasted like cool aid with booze. (The \"Southern\" was Southern Comfort. Not a fan.)  We ordered several plates from beef to veggies. When they arrived, I asked the server for her recommendation on cook times. She casually listed them off, \"30 seconds each side for the scallops, 45 seconds total for the beef...\" Sadly, should could not have been more wrong. Either she was terribly misinformed or the grill was awfully cool.   The scallops took about five minutes to become opaque. The beef took several minutes - even though the slices were very thin.  Folks here talk about the great prices. I suppose it depends on what you order. Four dollars for four stalks of asparagus? I'd say that's a bit steep. ...and then you have to cook it.   ... and it is all cooked on a smoke-free gas grill - which adds no flavor at all. I love smokey flavors - especially in a 'grill' or 'barbeque' meal.  Give me a cast-iron skillet and a campfire any day.  Spices were modest to the point of being absent. Conversely, the sauces on the table were overpowering. Not recommended.  The Bibimbop was fine. The salmon was also fine once it cooked - but again, I can do better at home.  Good company and a friendly server made this a good hang.  I would not come back for the food.",

We were there for the 1700-1830 happy hour which is the real steal (they also have a 2100 happy hour) The prices are decent at happy hour and the mains are on the happy hour menu -- kal bi, skirt steak, shrimp, poke, sushi, etc. However they also have a $55 Meat Lovers combo which was comparable to all of the hh items we purchased.   The best thing I had all night was the spicy ahi volcano complete with crispy rice. Worst was the ahi poke. But of course nothing compares to the way poke is served in Hawaii.  Service was ok. The manager checked on us, and the waiter was as attentive as he could be being the only one waiting on everyone in the restaurant at the time.   All in all -- Korean BBQ reigns over gyu-kaku japanese bbq",

Staying in Vegas with my girlfriends family I heard one opened here I was super excited until I witnessed the horror. The restaurant was nice but other than that who ever is running the place has no idea what they are doing. The service was utterly awful when we got served our water they said our water would be right with us. Yea right that never happened also the water we were served was the most disgusting water I have ever been served this is toilet water I am not kidding. It was so bad I was hesitant about the meat quality which was also not on par with Orange County Gyu Kaku. This place was the most disappointing part of the trip.",

Normally you go to a restaurant for service, food taste and quality, and lastly price. At least that's what I look for in a restaurant that we frequent.  Service: When we first discovered Gyu-Kaku, the service was prompt, attentive ad courteous.  Fast forward 3-4 months later, we waited for seats in a half empty restaurant.  Our meats were not served at the same time.  As in we went through 6 different meats and then the 7th showed up.  This was after we ate the first 6.  And this was just my husband and I dining.  Not to mention the disappearing soda refill that appeared 10 minutes later. Not happy since he was now a grumpy lunch date.  Food Taste: We love the taste of the food here. Simple. Easy. Delicious. It helps when you're the chef! I haven't purchased any pre-cooked items from the kitchen.  Food Quality: I have to admit that Gyu-Kaku is highly consistent with their cuts of meat and seasonings. Tender Filet Mignon! Beefy Angus Beef Ribs. Chicken seasoned impeccably.    Price: Happy Hour is a steal!  And there are two time periods 5-6:30 and after 9pm.   The customer service will deter us from returning, but the food taste and quality makes me want to come back.",

It came miso soup, gyoza, salad, tofu nuggets, and something with spicy tuna on top. It also came with mushrooms and spinach. It came with about 4 or 5 meats. Now, the meats came marinated with their own flavor. The servers are amazing. They are very great! They explain how long to cook the various items. The menu was explained to us, and the server offered his own suggestions.   I don't think the course was a very good value as it comes with tiny appetizers.  Also, I normally would not have ordered appetizers. If I ever do go again, I'll try their hh items or I'll just get A La Carte items. They should make courses for more than just 2 people!",

    "text": "I give this place 2 stars only because of our waiter. As gyu Kaku regulars my bf and I love their HH and the food. We stopped on a sat afternoon on a road trip from Southern California and decided this was a good spot to refuel and have dinner. There was 1 older gentleman as our waiter, serving 4 tables (we were one of them). Our meat took much longer than we have ever had to wait..and it was HH portions. We were first served our veggies- corn and spinach. Consumed that and our meat was still not served. Finally our meat arrived. Just one 6 slices of garlic steak. Our next 2 orders did not arrive until let's put it this way- the grill was already burnt and charred.  Those next two orders of meat were hard to even flip over, again, obviously because the grill was burnt and charred! We alerted our waiter, asking if we can change grill, and he just lowered the temperature of the grill. That was pretty annoying, esp since we are regulars at this place and our waiters change our the grill even before we have to ask. To be honest, after sitting in the car for a road trip for 4 hours and not having the normal practice standards of this establishment was quite annoying! This waiter needs to keep up with this place or management will be (if not already) hearing ALOT of complaints since this place gets busy.",

This has to be my favorite location just because of the drink menu.  Most of the other ones have the same drink menu, which mainly consists of soju cocktails; those are good but I appreciate the variety the LV location has.  I tried three drinks, including the mint apple, one with blue curacao and lychee (delicious!) and a raspberry one (a little tart for me but still good). It's probably one of the cheapest places to drink since the cocktails are $3-$5 during happy hour. Can't beat that!  And the food, as always, was delish.  Their calamari and cheese wontons are must haves.  Can't wait to go back next.",

Chicken was not fried properly to even look crisp and not to mention it was cold. Outter layer became mushy, made it seem it has been previously fried and was returned to kitchen to be brought out again for ordering guests. Food runner came to ask if everything was alright, quickly said the dish was cold and not hot. He immediately apologized and took the dish and walked away. Within 5 minutes the manager came by with the dish and called out chicken karage and set it on our table. It was the same... cold and not fried properly, there was not even a slight steam trail that I can see. Server finally approached table and asked if things were alright. I did not intend to be abrubt but two times I have complained and the same result has come to the table. I do not understand if it was cooked and just waiting to be served it was absolutely not freshly prepared.  Ordered egg soup and it was warm to touch not hot. No steam!!! Same as miso soup nothing was hot nothing was cooked properly! Meat was OK to taste, I have had better. I will not be going to this restaurant for quite some time. I feel the servers and whoever runs the place have no experience in the food business of ensuring satisfied guests. No one was attentive enough. If I will be paying $145 for my meal I expect service and QUALITY.  Only takes one chance for a first impression. I was not impressed.",

We went in around 8pm no reservation and the wait was an hour and a half!!! OMG so long, no worries though, they are open till 2am. so we decided to come back after our movie. We got back there around 1230am got sat immediately and we're ready! It was happy hour so everything was reduced in price a little. We left stuffed and only paid $43 with the 20% tip included. Well worth every penny. Will definitely be back :)",

We tried the different meats, broccoli and mushroom. To end the our experience was the Sake Bomb! I think everybody should try it for fun.

This restaurant and my server were really helpful in accommodating my needs. Plus the food was really yummy. I had the grilled spinach and garlic, short ribs and scallops wrapped in bacon which was \"to die for\". If you have allergies to wheat, be sure to ask your server not to give you anything marinated in standard soy sauce and they will be able to help you out.  As a side note, Las Vegas doesn't appear to be very GF/DF friendly in general.  I'm from LA and there are tons more options here.  I noticed that Pasadena also has one of these restaurants.

The host came by trying to work it, he insisted to come by after 2 minutes despite us telling him it's been ten minutes and it didn't work!! So he had to move us after that. A ramen noodle came after EVERYTHING was finished. By the time the check comes, we were charged 2 miso soups that were part of the lunch combos we ordered, an extra meat, and a more expensive combo for a total difference of $15. The waiter looked as if he's surprised that he's caught. Carefully inspect your check before you pay. We've been to other Gyu-Kaku before, and we were here solely because we had good experiences in other locations, and it turned out so disappointing. As we were straightening out the check, the table to the left of our new table had a cooktop/grill malfunction, and they had to move those customers. Then as we were leaving, a new group of guest were placed on that very same table. It made me think they knew what grills don't work, but they place the costumer there regardless. Terrible customer service!!  I'll give it a zero if that's an option.",

    "text": "Alrighty, I've been here 3 times, and all have been consistent, which is a good sign!   First time on my birthday 11/19: got the premium HH $55 Special which came with harami skirt, filet mignon, shrimp, pork belly, short rib and chicken. Of course it came with the app of soup, salad, edamame, and a few others as well like tofu nugget, gyoza, and an unknown lol. Top favorite were the skirt, filet and chicken. Service was good, the server at the time was starting his first day but did very well.   Second time was Friday night 1/22: came in with mom, this time got the same special, adding in beef tacos, cheese wonton, sweet potato fries. Before we could taste any of it my mom felt ill and wanted to go home, so I asked for my check and paid the bill and unfortunately had to cancel the meal. Tim the manager immediately responded with helping me out the next time we come in which lead to tonight.   Monday 1/25: Pretty busy for a Monday night, had to get a reservation first, spoke to Tim the manager and immediately helped us right away and got to continue with our last server, which was Steven, super cool dude! We ordered everything from last time that we didn't get to enjoy and got to taste everything and it was great! Service was excellent and frequent, food was cooked to right temperatures (appetizers). Total check was $88.00 with the extra filet mignon I ordered with drinks and tipped $25.00. Couldn't help but was impressed with the hospitality from this joint, thank you Tim and Steven for making a great experience!  Will come back for my fix again soon!",

I'm very used to eating undercooked meats and Japanese BBQ, so I don't know why my stomach is not taking it well. Other than that, the meat quality is pretty good, but the beef tongue was a big disappointment. I love beef tongue and I always order it when I have Japanese BBQ, but the quality just wasn't good. I didn't enjoy the Harami miso steak that was 1/2 off either. The butterfish was really good and so was the Kalbi beef. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert, Lady M. Green tea Crepe cake. The service was good and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, but the meats were just OK to me and having such a terrible stomach ache doesn't help either. I highly suggest cooking all the meat thoroughly as advised on the menu!",

The manager that was at the host station was nice, she got us tables that sat across from one another since we had a party of 7, we ordered our food 5 mins earlier from when our friends arrived but go your starters since we got the \"first starter pack\". The time of us ordering was at 1:02 and we didn't recurve our raw meat until 1:50 after we had to say something to them twice before getting our food. There was a couple that received there food before us that actually got seated after us. We got our food the same time as all of our other friends, they also gave us other tables food and appetizers, everything but our raw meat. So when we finally got our food the nice waiter explained that he would take 10% off but really we need our bill 50% off because this place was just very unorganized and instead of learning how to say namaste everyone needs to remember the times in which the food was placed for order.... Just saying. F.y.i I Heard California's location was better",

Gyu-Kaku you did me so wrong last night! :(  First experience about a couple weeks ago was superb, waitress was attentive, informative about the menu and we really enjoyed the food!  Now let me elaborate on last night's visit.. Upon being seated, we saw a baby cockroach chillin' on our table, alive and moving. Beau killed it-- asked me if I wanted to go but trust me I DONT KNOW why we stayed.. Service was good, but I just couldn't help myself in checking and making sure every item did not have a cockroach in it.. Don't get me wrong quality of food is there, but the satisfaction of enjoying the food wasn't there because the thought of a roach! I'm sure other places I've eaten at are worst but I just can't over the fact that I saw one.  I don't know when or if I'll be back..  I just can't believe my first roach review was on a placed I liked .. :/",

My very small complaint is that it gets hot in here. You have a hot grill in front of you and you can really feel it. Dress accordingly.",

    "text": "First impression. Super awesome bright entrance!   We walk in....pretty setting. Totally wanted to eat on the floor tables.   We get a booth and we were game. I was looking forward to coming here, but after I tried getting a few people's attention and them just looking away acting like I don't exist, i got a bit annoyed. I get it, our table isn't there's, but when my hands in your face and I say excuse me, at least acknowledge it. It took a good 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we've been helped. It just sucks it took someone to wail there hands around like those blow up guys in front of car dealerships to get their attention.  We got Andrew, and he was phenomenal. Great customer service. He told us what the menus about, but since we waited so long, we already knew what we wanted. Get a la carte! No point on getting the combo. Too expensive, and you might not get everything you may want to try.   The meat was OK, but not to die for. Small portion for each meat you order. They range from $5-$8. Not unless you get the Kobe, then that's about $20. We also got a couple appetizers. The garlic chicken and the calamari. Again, not to die for. Also, those were the worlds smallest fried calamari I've ever had from any restaurants I've ever been in.   Crunchy garlic sauce ppl were raging about...ehh.   The real reason I gave this 3 stars, which I think I'm being generous, is because from the corner of my eye I saw one of the ladies cleaning the table top with a dirty rag. I saw her wipe the grill from underneath and saw just dust and black muck on the rag. She then folds the rag, which is thin, and wipes the tables down with it. Then the booth and chairs. Soooo, ew. At least wipe the table top first, yanno?   Oh! And that playlist they played, I swear all the songs were from the 90's. They got that DDR music playing and made me wanna play it. Hah!   I also admit, I kind of miss the goth bar that was there prior to it being gyu kaku. Good times. \"(` ) Though, the renovation is pretty great.",

Having been to multiple Gyu-Kakus before this, I had high expectations of this restaurant. The staff and restaurant itself were great, however the food didn't live up to the hype.   Both Bibimbap bowls: I think it would be more appropriate to call them stone cooked fried rice bowls, rather than bibimbap. There were no vegetables, gochujang or egg in the bowl. It was just rice and some meat!   Kimchi: Disappointing :(  Meat: Ordered the skirt steak and kalbi short rib. Good, but not special enough for me to go back to Gyu-Kaku for.   If you're looking to eat meat, try a different restaurant on Spring Mountain!",

Wifey and I ordered the Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap, Hanger Steak, Harami(Skirt Steak), and Bacon Wrapped Asparagus. There are so many other items to choose from, it would have to take a few more visits to kill the entire menu! I like that they have both cooked and DIY stuff so you won't go hungry waiting for other items on the grill.  Service was great, and another cool thing is that you don't smell like the grill afterwards. Can't wait for Gyu Kaku's Happy Hour to start. Its gonna be a busy HH spot!  ALOHA!!!

The desserts were delicious as well, I had the Lady M's Green Tea Mille Crepe (really creamy!) and Chocolate Lava Cake w/ Ice Cream (it melts in your mouth~).

Then she gave me the check and it had the stuff i ordered including the the other order I didn't get .  And I told my waiter and she left and came back and said she thought she her coworker brought the food . Which is funny cause she passed my table many times and my table was empty .

( sometimes they get busy)    First off head down for Happy hour, Monday & Wednesday is all day! What crazy right, well its so worth it. Tuesday&Thursday-Sunday is 12pm -6:30pm and 9pm-12:30am. During these times hit up the appetizers and sides for the best deal.    Now on the BBQ meat and seafood section just about the same great selection.  Hirami Miso and the Kalbi short rib are a must but don't be afraid to get the Angus beef rib. This might be the best kept secret on the menu! The mushrooms are a must the garlic mushroom is my favorite...    If this is your first time, start with one of the Value BBQ course for 2. These will give you a great sample of what they have to offer. Just choose what works best you and your party. The best part is after your meal the dessert is they pull off the grill and bring you S'mores.     Each time i come here and get great service and they bring out the food really fast, I mean you cook it yourself?  The side dishes are on point as well so be sure to try it all. I love it here and continue to bring friends and family!",

We stood at the host stand for 2 minutes wondering if anyone was working. Saw the bartender and a couple of servers from where we were standing, but still no greeting towards us. Finally, the manager came out nonchalantly with no apology for us waiting, and casually brought us to our table which was still not clean. By not clean, I mean that it looked like someone just wiped the tabletop quickly and called it a day. There was a used napkin under the table from the previous guests, a vent had fallen off the grill which was laying at my feet, not to mention food crumbs. For how empty the restaurant was, I was dumbfounded that the attention to detail was lacking. I could see the same situation with food crumbs underneath other tables from where I was seated. Looked like they haven't cleaned and mopped their floors in god knows how long. Also, the 3 glass bottles on the table which housed the sauces for the meats were sticky and hadn't been wiped down either. Super gross.  I know the meats are usually pre-marinated, but I felt they were over-marinated and too salty. Not many vegetable options either.  Our server was nice, but nice doesn't cut it. He would disappear for lengths of time, especially after we were done with the meats. I didn't even bother to order dessert, and the check took forever to hit our table.  Won't recommend or be returning.",

Having been to Gyu-Kaku in Oahu I knew what to expect.   This isn't an AYCE, but during happy hour the food more than justifies the price. They have pre-set dining options or you can go ahead and pick out different meats as you go with your meal.   One of the things I hate about doing yakaniku is how long the smell lingers on your clothes afterwards. Here it isn't an issue. Right above the flames/grill is a circle of vents that vacuum out any smoke meeting you enjoy your meal without smelling like cooked meats.   In all I will most definatly be coming back. The prices on meats and drinks are too good to pass up",

I've been to the Vegas location and the one in Huntington Beach, Ca and the food, atmosphere and service  have all been consistently great.  Their happy hour is absolutely awesome and you can eat and drink like a king and still come out with a reasonable tab. Their meat selections are all reasonable with some off the wall stuff like intestines and liver for the more adventurous eater.  Th alcohol isn't just beer but various colorful drinks that you'd be embarrassed to be caught with. But you'll still drink them because they're that good.   I usually just go in for happy hour and feel like this is one of the best deals around without feeling like you're eating in a barn somewhere. It's reasonably priced without sacrificing all the glam.",

Darwin, our server, was attentive and catered to small requests like changing the grill or water refill. He also explained everything to us about the slices and flavor profile. I'm coming back next time and order more stuff.  The ambiance and interior was like casual Japanese style BBQ place. Food is 10 out of 10, a bit more butter on the garlic butter next time but everything else was great. There's a lot of parking on the side since it's close to a supermarket.",

As always the service was great but it seems that the portion sizes are going to keep shrinking and unfortunately I will be hesitant to return to this restaurant.",

The price is starting from $30s. I was skeptical at first to try this Japanese bbq style but I am so surprised how good it is. We got the supreme for $40 something with a pitch of Asahi ( I highly recommend Asahi with BBQ). They have aged beef from 21 -26 days that you can pick from. The meats were on point, well marinated, and you could taste the quality. For dessert , you can get your own s'mores, a few different flavor of sorbets, and ice cream. Not just the food that I was impressed, I was so impressed with our server I believe his name is Bryan ( Ryan), he was super attentive and knowledgeable about the food. I will definitely come back in the future.",

If you have lived in town for any length of time you know that this particular building has been many different dining and bar establishments but hopefully Gyu-Kaku is here to stay!    We checked it out on a whim and now it is one of our regular favorites.  We have taken several of our friends here and they've all loved it. It's great for date night and it's great for families. The grill is far enough away from kids depending on where you seat them.  The kids love the s'mores at the end and enjoy watching the cooking at the table. The meat is amazing. Pay attention to how long they want you to cook it. The Toro beef is the best. We always get an extra order or two of that.  The staff has always been super friendly and accommodating. Download their app to get dining rewards. Not long and you can get $25 off your bill!  They do reservations on Open Table online which makes it super easy to book. I definitely recommend having a reservation on the busier days.   We continue to go to this restaurant.  I just have to say that RJ is the BEST server you can ask for. He remembers us and always takes good care of us. He is friendly, attentive and drinks are never empty. He knows the menu and is always willing to answer questions. I hope management sees how amazing he is and goes to great lengths to keep him around!",

    "text": "Las Vegas' Chinatown is a culinary hub for a reason: the large number of delicious restaurants along this stretch of Spring Mountain that represent many different cultures along the Asian seaboard! This time, I went to Gyu-Kaku, a Japanese restaurant focusing on yakiniku, Japanese grilled meats -- and the structure is fairly similar to Korean BBQ and its focus on grilling your own meat. I think I prefer Japanese yakiniku more because of the variety, but that's just me. Again, this is another of my personal favorite restaurants in town!  Typically, Gyu-Kaku is busy over the weekends, which is why I usually come in during the weekday. If you want good service here, too, ask for RJ! When you come in, you're taken to a table with a grill that takes a while to heat up -- which is why I recommend getting appetizers to start off while waiting for the grill to come to temperature! For me, the perfect appetizers are some miso soup and gyoza -- both are delicious and very light, and prime you for the meat ahead.  If you take advantage of the supreme option, your best bet is to take advantage of some of the pricier cuts like the secret pot harami and the galbi. For me, I start with basil chicken, duck breast, the filet mignon and the beef tongue, and also get a mushroom medley, cheese fondue and rice. This combination of meat, vegetable and rice is my personal favorite combination to start with. Though the servers typically tell you the grilling times required for each piece of meat, I tend to go by feel and look rather than time -- and get perfect medium rare beef and perfectly cooked poultry every time.  For my next round I got the aforementioned harami steak and the galbi -- both of which were delicious, tender and flavorful! One thing to keep an eye on while grilling is the hot spots on the grill, though -- as you can see in some of the pictures, I underestimated how hot some of these were and ended up burning some parts of the meat. Oops!  My final round involves the pork belly, the miso skirt steak, and the bistro hangar steak -- again, all off the top options of the supreme menu and all very good! Of course, I again accidentally burned some of the meat due to not accounting for the hot spots in the grill, but it says something that even the burned parts of the meat were all still juicy and flavorful.  For dessert they give you the option of grilling s'mores over the fire -- one of the few, if not the only, restaurant I've seen thus far that has s'mores as a dessert option. As it was hot outside, I opted instead for the sorbet option, which was five different bite-sized sorbet cubes of mango, strawberry, mojito mint, blackberry and pina colada flavors. They were very light and refreshing, with the mango and the pina colada being my favorite flavors.  When you mention Asian-style BBQ, Korean BBQ is most likely going to be the first option on everyone's minds -- and no surprises there, considering that Korean BBQ restaurants are everywhere in Chinatown. But if you want something different, I suggest Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ for a change. They're just as good as Korean BBQ, have a broader selection, and who knows -- you may like it just as much as it more than Korean BBQ like I do!",

    "text": "Sometimes, the timing is everything. And that's certainly the case when you choose when to dine at Gyu-Kaku. If you're a budget-conscious diner, this is the place for you--if you know when to go!  The restaurant is open from noon to 12:30 am, with happy hour from noon to 6:30 and 9 to close (plus all day Monday and Wednesday). Nearly everything on the menu (including alcohol) is marked down, so I definitely recommend timing your visit. Seems like the only times to avoid are 6:30 to 9 on all days except Monday and Wednesday. Otherwise, you are golden.  Along with that awesome happy hour schedule, they also have lunch specials from noon to 4. So my husband and I got to order from both menus, as we arrived at 3 for a late lunch.  We each had a lunch special: signature cut for me, and meat lover's for him. For $13.95 and $11.95, respectively, we got a ton of tasty food: seven different cuts of meat and two jumbo shrimp, plus sides of rice, edamame, salad, and miso soup. There was so much food that we couldn't finish it, especially after we ate our add-ons of pork belly ($4.25) and fried bacon chips ($4). Most of the food was really tasty, although some of the meats were a little too sweet and the bacon chips were a bust. (A great concept, but just fry yourself some pork belly instead and skip the bland battered bacon bites.)  This is a really fun place that makes for a great interactive experience, as you are cooking the food yourself on the tabletop grill. But I wouldn't recommend it if you're planning to have an in-depth conversation with someone. You've got to keep your eyes on your food, or it'll burn up pretty quickly!  And note that while they offer an all-you-can-eat option, unless you're really famished, just stick with the lunch specials and maybe a couple of add-ons. You'll get more than enough food, and a fun experience, too!",

They have like 4 locations in Hawaii. Where was I?! All my friends hid me from this location!   Customer service is usually great. There has been times where our server just never came back. But there are a few who I love. The ones who are very upbeat and fun.  Best time to go here for a quick snack or light grub is during happy hours. The scheduling can be found on their website. The starting prices for appetizers and meats are typically around 4-5 bucks. Drinks start at 3-5 bucks from what I remember. I usually come here during late night happy hour because I get off work pretty late sometimes. But I stopped going everyday cause gained a little weight from all their good food. If you do come to place I do recommend downloading their app. Receive points and you can get a free meal, dessert or even discount off your next visit!   Things you must try: Shishito peppers, cheese wontons, any bibimbap, garlic rice, toro beef, yaki-shabu beef, angus beef, Gyu-Kaku salad, broccoli and cheese, and the best part... their lava cake!",

    "text": "I've dined at Gyu-Kaku once before last summer when I was in Vancouver (enjoyed it a lot!) and decided to try it out in Vegas since I've been craving a good beer with BBQ. Arrived here at around 4:30pm after work with my friend on Friday and was seated in around 10 minutes. Upon entering, there is a bar located on the right side and booth seating and tables to the left. The restaurant is a bit dim and sort of gives off the izakaya vibe. We were seated on one side of a table meant for large parties (there's a center divider so it wasn't awkward at all when there was another party seated on the other side of us). Our server was really friendly and apologized to us in advance if service was slow, since they were short staffed with only two servers and had multiple of tables to tend to. However, throughout the two hours we were there, service was quick and very attentive! We never had to wait or flag down our server whenever we needed anything. Service was GREAT!  He noticed us looking at the beer menu and came over to ask us if we would like to order some beer after giving us our waters. We ordered two large mugs of Kirin that we received quickly. Afterwards, we ordered two lunch combinations with three items, and got one rice upgrade to the bibimbap. We received our order within a few minutes and began enjoying our meats- they were all great. I've worked at a Korean BBQ restaurant previously and can say that they provide good meat quality, and I really liked how their meats aren't heavily seasoned/drenched in marinade.  We spent a lot of time chatting throughout our meal, and our server often came by to take away our empty plates and change our grill. After finishing our meal, we ordered the Lady M crepe Mille cake since my friend has never tried it. I'm from LA, so I've eaten it often. The size of the cake slice is quite small- I'm pretty sure they cut a regular slice in half and charge it normal price, but there's no Lady M in Vegas so it's a bit understandable. It comes with a slice of vanilla ice cream though which was very picturesque (look at my picture), we thought it was whipped cream until it started to melt.  Overall, we had a great dining experience. Service was amazing, food was great, and prices made the food taste even better. I will be returning to try their cocktails as well.",

I really like their lunch and happy hour specials.   We went twice last week, once for dinner and a couple days later for lunch. For our first visit we did the all-you-can-eat menu (the most expensive one) which was great. My favorite thing about the AYCE menu is that the desserts are also AYCE. Yup, all you can eat macaron ice cream sandwiches. When we returned for lunch we each ordered a 3-4 item lunch. It was 1/3 the price of dinner but we ate the same amount of food. If you can really throw down, go for the ultimate AYCE. Otherwise, you might be better off going smaller.   My faves: bone-in kalbi, harami miso skirt steak  Hubby's faves: spicy yaki shabu beef, premium ny steak  I'll def be back for lunch. You can't beat the value of their lunch specials!",

We (my husband and I) had the Surf and Turf option for two at $77.77  It included edamame, dumplings, broccoli and cheese fondue, miso soup, salad, ahi poke, salmon, garlic shrimp, bibimbap, marinated skirt steak (our favorite) and american style kobe beef along with veggies for grilling and to top it all off smores!    Ryan our server was extra attentive!  The food came promptly and Ryan instructed us on exactly how long to cook the various food items as well as what sauce would complement them.  Before we cooked the kobe style beef, Ryan even came to switch out our grill so it would be fresh for that beautiful cut of meat.    There was so much food, we were stuffed to the gills and still had leftovers to bring home.    Both managers stopped by our table to ensure or experience was exceptional.  It was a nice touch.  We made a reservation in advance, but it was Monday night and we probably didn't need one.  It was nice not to have to wait for long amounts of time like other BBQ places.  We were definitely impressed and will be back again!",

We arrived and were immediately seated. Our server was nice, but very very slow. It took over 20 mins to get drinks. It took about 45mins to get one of 15 plates. The last dish was brought to our table about 5 mins before we left. The rice and noodle bowls were dry. When I brought this to the Managers attention he agreed that the food on our table looked bad. He said he was going to give us a credit. The bill came and the credit was about $6... not even enough to cover the price of a rice/noodle bowl. When I expressed my concern about the credit to the Manager, he increased the credit by a couple of dollars and smirked. I'll never eat here again.",

It is a complete meal consisting of soup and salad, a nice selection of beef items and a single s'more for dessert. The beef is cut up into small pieces for you to cook up at the table. The only \"fly in the ointment\" was that one of the items they brought to the table as New York steak was in fact, pork. When I pointed this out to the waitstaff he insisted it was New York steak. We cooked it up and guess what? If it looks like pork, cooks like pork and tastes like pork, it's pork. When I brought it to the attention of our waiter a second time he said the kitchen told him it was \"labeled\" New York steak. I should have asked for a manager, but I didn't want to put a damper on what was a great evening. For the record, service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive. In addition, they have several specials and happy hours.",

I've eaten at more questionable establishments before so a B rating was only enough for me to take pause. My favorite items on their menu are the duck breast and Japanese pork sausages. I'm not a huge fan of their beef items because they put some sort of sauce on them. I prefer the beef plain for grilling. I would suggest skipping the course menus and just getting exactly what you want a-la-carte. The course meals, for me, had too many items I wouldn't normally order. There's plenty of seating and the space reminds me of a mainstream yakiniku(grilled meat) restaurant in Tokyo. So far, Gyu-Kaku opens for dinner at 5pm and doesn't close it's doors til 2am.

I was excited to try this place because the reviews looked great and it's a neat experience. I made a reservation for our party of 3 and we were seated promptly after arriving. We had a cozy booth near the front.  We were informed that Monday's were happy hour and we each got delicious drinks. We ordered some appetizers. Although we didn't need to. Our meal for 2 fed all three of us easily. I ordered the cabbage salad. It was light and delicious. I liked the sauce they used. We also ordered some calamari. It was ok. I didn't care for the breading or the sauce that came with it.  We ordered the \"meats\" dinner for 2 I believe. It came with Miso soup, a salad, a ton of meat, and dessert. We ordered extra sides of spinach, broccoli, and shrimp. Our server was very sweet. With each dish he brought out, he told us how to cook it and for how long. The cool thing is you can vary your cook time depending on your taste. I like my red meat a little more rare so I cooked it for less time.   The only meat I didn't care for, was the pesto chicken. The garlic shrimp was particularly good. Overall, the experience was great. The smores at the end were a nice touch. I would like to go back the next time I'm in town.",

The ice cream tastes fresh and creamy. It was happy hour so the bill was just right. They have set of meals for 2 to 4 people. We did ala carte. Next time we will get the set.",

    "text": "Not the best tabletop grilling style Japanese BBQ I've ever tried, (especially if you have ever had the luxury to try Anjin in Costa Mesa, CA) but there were some redeeming dishes of the evening. They also offer some decent deals during happy hour; plus they have pre fixe dinner combos that seem like they would be a good option for some: ranging from $55, $66, $77.77 and in addition to 20% off those set prices during happy hour. Happy hour is daily 5-6:30pm & 9-close.  We prefer selecting our few favorites from the menu so we went the a la carte route. Here's our favorites of the evening:  Garlic herb Filet mignon $7.95 - it was tender and grilled nicely on the tabletop grill.  Bacon asparagus $4.95 - bacon makes everything better.  Spicy pork $3.95 - classic Korean style spicy pork - mild, but cooked well on the grill and a great cheap meat dish to get your fill.  Angus ribs $4.95 - tender, juicy and seasoned well.  Miso $1.95 - traditional style, comforting, came out piping hot, and a plus it's not watered down!  Spicy tuna volcano $5.95 - it's packed up with a load of crispy fried rice, but if you eat it carefully, you can reserve some of that extra crispy rice and enjoy it with your grilled meats. I highly recommend that!  Beef tongue $7.95 - very tender and you can't go wrong! I love it.  Scallion sauce $1 - order this sauce. Order lots of it!!! The beef tongue and the rest of the grilled meats paired perfectly with this sauce.  Crunchy garlic sauce $1 - an oily bomb, but don't fret, the crispy charred garlic and spice bits are actually really tasty with the grilled meats- so scoop away!  Rice $1.95 - we really didn't need to order the rice, but one order was more than enough to share between 2 adults (just make sure you took my tip about the spicy tuna volcano's crispy rice above and you'd be set for success!)   Pass on these: Toro beef $3.95 - dried out, chewy  Yakishabu $3.95 - dried out, very chewy Corn butter $2.95 - skip! Canned corn and not special in any way Garlic mushroom $2.95 - it was also very basic, so it's worth passing on, but if you're a mushroom lover like us, it may be worth a try   What made this place just OK to me, was their sauces. The sauce makes or breaks Japanese BBQ and theirs were lacking authenticity. They offer 3 tabletop sauces: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy, which are are mediocre and could use some extra love. They each tasted basic as if they were purchased bottled from the asian section at the grocery store. Leaves a lot to be desired, you feel me? Well, if I had to choose a favorite it would definitely be the spicy one. Had a nice tang and slight sweetness to it; not spicy in the slightest.   Now that you've heard the word, get cookin', good lookin'!!",

    "text": "The Skinny: the grilled meats are good quality but the side dishes are not that impressive (3) service: good and efficient. Not smoky/smelly for a yakiniku place - no changing table in the restroom.(4) value: recommend coming in for lunch on Wednesday (all day happy hour) as the lunch combinations are the things to get. 10% locals discount can be used with coupons offered through their app. (3.5 starred review)  Since <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> now only offers rewards at limited restaurants in Vegas, we are more likely to hit this place more often (can be redeemed here and Buca Di beppo....I frankly prefer here).  Lunch is way better pricing than dinner so we hit them up for their lunch sets. I usually get their Meat lover's set for $10.95 which comes with 4 types of meat at 2oz each, a small salad, gyoza, soup and rice. It's a good portion of food and quite filling. They also have a create your own options are well at $9.95 for 2 BBQ items and $12.95 for 3 items which comes with soup, salad and rice. They also have non-grilled lunch sets like to the hamburger steak or bibimbap bowl for less than $13.  The meats are the highlights here.  The quality here is pretty good.The marinated meats are slightly on the sweeter side and very tender. Cooking over the grill is nice due to the great ventilation system (i.e. not smelly or too smokey).   The miso soup is pretty standard. The salad is largely made of daikon and kind of heavy on the mayo. Gyoza also ho-hum and I probably would not order it unless it was in a set.  For dessert, they have Lady M green tea crepe cake brought in... probably from LA. Ours was served with ice cream even though the signs in the restaurant says that it doesn't. (Maybe it's just me but I don't know what all the fuss is about.) They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches from Brick (it's an LA thing) which I haven't tried but am pretty intrigued.  Service is good and fast generally. Ambience is modern with loud dance music playing. As for bringing kids here, I guess kids and grills don't mix well - hence the lack of changing tables in the bathroom. Just saying.  The value here is when you apply the discounts here on top of coming in for lunch. Locals get 10% off, dinner sets for 2 are 20% off on Saturday and Sunday. Get their app for additional coupons towards dining. Add in the Open table rewards factor this joint is a place I see myself coming back to. 3.5 starred review.",

And who doesn't love using tongs to grill with.  Make sure to call ahead for a reservation, this place gets packed. Good for sitting at the bar and watching the game, or on a romantic date for two, or with a group- although I don't like sharing so once again, what out or I may get you with the tongs.  It can be a bit overwhelming with all the choices so come hungry and try as many as your belly will allow.  Check our their HH specials-will make your wallet thank you.",

Colors of meats are grossly dark. No marblings at all.  Tastes are gross. So me&my friend decided to drink beer instead of eating that gross foods. But there was an happy hour for beer allyoucandrink, the manager (he called his self manager) never tell us they have offers for drinks. Cause he want us to pay double whenever we order beers. So stupid. We sat about 30mins, they force us to pay and get  out the restaurant.(there was many tables include us,and it was only10pm) Even though my beers just got opened. If you guys gonna close soon and gonna let us kick out,then why you take the orders for beer?? not giving services and foods but wants money from customer? Ridiculous.",

We ordered the combo for 2 people... the food was great, no problem about the food (I cooked most of it anyways) but the service was absolutely terrible. The guy was nice but being nice doesn't get you too far if you can't do your job.   We didn't get our waters refilled NOT ONCE. I ended up drinking my sons water in his kid cup because I didn't have water. We needed forks for the kids, asked for forks, he forgot.. we asked again... he forgot again. We ended up walking to the kitchen and asking for forks.   It took about 15-20 min to bring our meats out... we were the only ones in the restaurant. It wasn't like they were busy. How is it gonna take long to bring out raw meat on plates?   Then we asked for a second round of meat halfway through our meal, and they didn't come out until we were ready to leave. We ended up canceling the meat.   Our edamame came to our table about 5 minutes before we left. Our food was eaten already. EDAMAME IS AN APPETIZER. How can you not even bring edamame on time???   We won't be back. At least not to this location.",

This is a great place to come with a large group of people and have a great time.  They play loud top hits music and have reasonable priced drinks! They also offer happy hour pricing everyday from 5 PM to 630 PM...  What I loved the most was the s'mores experience..... I know, I know a bit silly but it really took me back to my camping fun times... How many times can u make ur own s'mores!!! Either way, awesome, totally recommendable restaurant!

I waited an hour to be seated they weren't even busy and had tables available which I don't get?! I mean you come & cook your own food, all you have to do is provide a good experience. I guess I will to go to California.",

I chose the $42 one and I promise you it's worth it! All of their meat is so tender and is well seasoned. They have good appetizers included in the all you can eat as well. And to make things even better, their desserts are ayce too!!! The service is extremely nice here as well. One thing I liked about our server in particular was the fact that he would tell us about how long each meat needed to be cooked for everytime he brought us out our meats. If you want some quality ayce bbq, this is the place for you.",

The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.    We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.           Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.    The only letdown was the \"Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap\".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.    Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.",

Think about it this way- if you go to a steakhouse or what I like to call \"white-people restaurants\", you will be paying MORE for just 2 steaks, and just 1 appetizer. And it will also be dark as fuck and you will wait a longass time for your food.   If you go to Gyu-Kaku, you get a variety of unlimited beef, appetizers, and dessert. Its also popping, the servers are fast, and theres also fucking overhead lighting.  This is why I only eat at Asian restaurants. White people can go crazy eating $20 pastas or $50 ribeye steak. I'll be happy with my $42 AYCE Japanese BBQ with unlimited meats, vegetables, appetizers, and desserts.",

Don't get me wrong the food is good--however I've been to Gyu-Kaku in Boston and LA and the taste and quality of food was definitely better. So there's a lack of consistency in menu items across different locations for sure. None of it was bad, but none of it was impressive.

I didn't need those sauces with the meat because everything we ordered already had a sauce or was marinated. We went during happy hour and got the $60 meat lover set & thick cut miso beef tongue (seasonal option). The menu recommends that set for two people but I feel like 3 people could've been comfortable. It was A LOT of food for just me and my husband. It was a struggle but it was really good. The meat lover set comes with s'mores for dessert. They remove the grill and turn up the fire so that you can roast your marshmallow. Super yummy, lots of food, super satisfied. I would highly recommend if you care about meat quality!  --Hubby also got a $5 Kirin mega mug during happy hour",

This place happens to have a-la-carte as well as various AYCE options, the cheapest starting at 32.99 as it moves it's way up with more options.   This place is actually really good, and went above my expectations; i don't think there was anything out of what I ordered that I didn't like. Their shrimp plate actually has pretty big shrimp on it, the meats are well marinated and taste great, and the service is great, too; everyone was very patient and understanding.   I keep trying to think if there was anything in particular that could be better about this place, but I honestly have no criticisms because my experience was awesome and the food was to die for.  While there is a time limit on the AYCE, I honestly felt like we went over and no one rushed us out or told us to leave, which was very kind of them!",

But they also offer AYCE here if you did want to go that route.   My favorite meat to order here is the toro beef. I also really enjoy their garlic noodles here and their sukiyaki bibimbap!   Some side dishes that I love are the addicting cucumbers and the cabbage salad. These as sides with the meat just give you a refreshing crunchy bite. It's not really spicy to me but just kind of has the kimchi kind of seasoning.   The service there is also always amazing and the servers are so kind.

    "text": "This is a pretty yummy Japanese BBQ place. It's a chain with many locations across the US.   It's similar to Korean BBQ places in that you order various meats and cook them yourself at your table.   They have several packages including assorted meats and sides, or you can order things a la carte.   We had a reservation, but we still waited about 30 minutes to be seated even though it didn't seem that busy. There were many tables in totally empty sections as well which seemed odd.   They have a couple of different happy hour timeframes on certain days (see their website), and during these times they have cocktail specials and a special meal combo for $50. They have a rewards app you should definitely download which is very easy to use. They also have an all you can eat section of the menu with prices ranging from $32 to $52 per person with either a 90 or 120 minute time limit.   I tried a peachtini cocktail which was actually pretty gross. No peach flavor, and it tasted a bit like cough medicine. Yuck.   We went for a meal combo which was about $60 and included a ton of food including soup, salad, Japanese fried chicken, rice, and meat. We upgraded the rice to two different kinds of fried rice which were both very good. The sirloin was probably the best of the meats and was tender and flavorful. The kalbi was also pretty good as well. Some of the other cuts of meat were a bit tough, though. Overall, the meats were decent but seemed of a lower quality than some of the Korean BBQs we have visited. The fried chicken and salad were quite good. The combo included two servings of s'mores you make yourself at the table. A nice sweet ending which was not overwhelming. I cannot remember being this full after a meal for a long time.   Overall, this was a pretty good meal other than having to wait a long time with a reservation. We will probably be back and give it another try. We will probably fast for 24 hours before going, though - lol.",

My husband and I went during lunch hour on a Saturday. I made reservation before hand and we were seated immediately. We did the $50 happy hour menu which comes with 4 different kinds of meat plus 2 sets of rice, salads and miso soup. We added beef tongue and \"kalbi\" steak since they weren't on the happy hour menu. I highly recommend trying out beef tongue and kalbi. They are delicious!   Our waiter was fantastic helping us decide if we had enough food. He also came half way to change out the grill since it was getting burnt out. Our water was refilled throughout our meal and after we had paid, he came to make sure we were happy with everything.   How I wish we had a Gyu-Kaku in Denver!",

    "text": "I would leave -5 stars if I could.   Last year this place was good.  Two+ years ago bomb.  Now the food looks and taste like something I wouldn't give my dog. The meat used to look and taste good now it is unedible.  The food is disgusting. I took one bite of each of the beefs and spit one out. Then we left to go anywhere else. Despite all the managers efforts to try and salvage the experience he could not. When the food is terrible the experience can not be salvaged. That being said he provided A+ service that was so good I debated not posting this. But in the end a restaurant has a responsibility to serve good food and consumers have a responsibility to hold them to a standard of quality.   So we walk in around 9:30 and wait a bit for the hostess to get to us, seat us and bring us water. It takes a while longer to get a server. But we were not upset by this. They seemed short staffed so a little wait is expected.   The water was nasty Vegas tap. If you live in Vegas you know what I mean. Most places serve it and it is awful.  The menus and table were sticky and covered in sauce and God knows what else. I guess they don't clean anything in this place. But we wanted a small meal and bbq still sounded good.   The food itself look almost like fish chum. Like I guess they buy pre cut meat and toss it in a bucket to sit for hours with marinade. Look at old yelp photos and you can see it used to look nothing like it does now. Still cooked a couple of pieces but we should have left then.  The beef toro with shio white soy was very white and presented in a sloppy pile like chum. It did not taste terrible but one bite and I was done. It did not taste fresh despite the manager assuring me it was.   The Yaki-Shabu beef in miso was a whole other ordeal. It also looked like chum but more red. Smelled like cheap jerky and tasted like something on fear factor. I instantly spit this out and was done. But got to taste it for another thirty minutes because the awful flavor would not wash out.   We did not even try the basil chicken. The spinach was okay but after a bite of the Yaki-Shabu I did not want to put anything from Gyu Kaku in my mouth.   The manager assured us the food was fresh and asked if he could do anything. He mentioned most of the meat is pre cut and they marinade it in house. He said it has always been pre cut. But looking at old yelppers photos I can tell the meat is very different. It might have always been pre cut but the quality was much higher in the past.   As my husband said \"this place is shit\".",

Their apps are great - I really liked the calamari and the fried chicken. We ordered the garlic fried rice thinking it was going to be a small bowl but nooo! It's huge and delicious.   I want to come back here every week now!! Our server was really cool and made good recommendations. Next time i come back, I'll definitely get some dranks from the happy hour menu! Come hungry!!",

I have my favorites of course and some Im not too fond of. I don't like ordering the corn because they put it in a aluminum container that never heats up. I really like the thin stake, can't remember the name, but it's thin, cooks fast and is very good with the sauces provided. I stick with the shrimp and steaks. I'm not too adventurous anymore, I know what I like and I order that when I come here but for newbies it's good to come in a group and share and sample. They have family options.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for the happy hour BBQ course $50 for 2 people deal after a friend suggested this place. I can't say that I will ever come back nor did I understand why he recommended we come here.  Upon arriving, nobody was at the front to greet or seat us, and the restaurant wasn't even busy. Only one other set of guests were dining at the time. We had to wait at the front for about 10 minutes before being seated, and once seated we noticed that a lot of the plates, sauce trays, and silverware were dirty. All the sauce bottles were dirty and sticky. Before we even began eating, this place already seemed unappetizing, but against better judgement we stayed to give the food a shot.  The food came out, and it looked amazing. Unfortunately, the experience was still bad. The server kept bringing food out and filling up the table to the point that we didn't have any space, and it was hard to maneuver to eat or grab things. We found ourselves trying to combine meats on previous plates or throwing extra on the grill just to make room. The grill was never changed out nor was the heat adjusted at all so our food kept burning. Despite the meat looking good, we could hardly taste any flavor past the charred, burned meat. The salad had way too much dressing on it, and the dressing itself was already an overwhelming taste.   Lastly, the price was too high for how much food we were given. I definitely did not think it was two people's worth of food. Hardly any meat is included on each plate. For the price, I surely thought we'd at least receive quality OR quantity, but we got neither. I can definitely pay that price elsewhere for all you can eat and much better quality.  Maybe ordering small dishes off the happy hour menu would have been the better option... I definitely would not recommend the BBQ course or all you can eat options though.",

For that situation it was good be sat there because we were always able to see him or catch him if we needed to order more. Kalbi short rib and bacon wrapped aspargus were my favorite.

What I like about it is that there's a full bar so if there's a wait you can always head there and you can even order appetizers! That makes the wait go by way faster. I've never had an issue with wait time at this location though compared to the ones in Cali. Maybe because it is a lot bigger as well. Servers were very friendly and attentive. This is a Japanese BBQ and most of the items you will be grilling on your own and there's also appetizers and noodle and rice dishes that come from the kitchen. My favorite dishes from here are beef sukiyaki, garlic noodles, spicy tuna volcano with avocado, beef tongue, prime kalbi, filet mignon, garlic shrimp, broccoli with cheese, and mushroom medley. I hear their bacon chips are amazingg but I have yet to give that a try. Besides from Gangnam, this is my go to place for a NON-ayce bbq spot.",

    "text": "Got the Sakura deal. $55. Came with salad, calamari (didn't finish this, too oily and too much batter, couldn't really taste the Calamari), angus beef bites were delicious (tasted like a beef stew, very tender, with mushrooms), garlic were shrimp were way too salty, all the other beefs were good, my husband liked it but I like the Korean BBQ flavors more. The mushrooms medley were good but once again a bit too salty for my taste. There are 3 sauces to dip in so I think thy should have went lighter on the marinate. The dessert was suppose to be a green tea cake with ice cream but instead it came with whip cream which is in no way shape or form a good substitute for ice cream, I was very disappointed with that! The green tree cake was not good either, weird textures to me. Service was great. Got my drink refilled multiple times. Next time instead of the deal I might just prefer individual items.",

It is the first time we had been here and in any kind of this restaurant. As we looked through the menu the specials for two people caught our eye and we ordered one and split it 3 ways. As we finished we weren't full and decided to order more. Our server JJ was awesome in recommending different things off the menu. When we finished the recommended things we moved onto dessert and the smores were a cool thing for the group to enjoy. Will definately be coming back with more people.",

One of the employees charged us for an item that we did not order and we let her know about the mistake. She goes to the back and comes back to our table and says something along the lines of \"well you ate it but I'll take it off the receipt. But you still ate it\" um ok? When you get 5 plates of meat brought to your table at once it's kinda hard to tell if we ordered it or not... Anyways, fast forward to 6 months later and I love this place! All of their employees now were definitely carefully picked because they are courteous, polite, and respectful. (Our server yesterday was Steven, thank you!)The meat lovers set at HH is supposed to be for 2 people but is more than enough for 3. They also have some of the best drink specials in Vegas. Check them out for a chill night with great food and drinks. :)",

    "text": "First time to the Vegas Gyu-kaku.    Exterior is pretty and inviting.  Check!  Hostess had no record of our reservation.  Called around 4pm on the day of for a party of 4.  Still got sat after waiting about 3-5 minutes.    I see their \"B\" rating is posted.  Yipes.  Waiter took a very long time to take our order.  He had extra tables but kept us informed and was very nice.    Finally took our order and after waiting a little bit, our drinks and food start to arrive. Wine glasses were not polished (water spots and lips on both glasses)... :-(  First item - calamari.  Cold but tasty for hungry people.  Appetizers and vegetables start arriving as well.  Edamame - ok, Broccoli with cheese - yum!, Garlic Fried Noodles - ok, Asparagus - ok, Garlic Chicken - yum!, Mushroom Medley - good, Cheese Wontons - ok, but where's the cheese?, Salad - good.  Meats start arriving and we start cooking.  Everything tasty but kind of gristly, at least on the pieces I ate.  We start getting full.  Lots of food for the Meat-Lovers Course.  Many items were forgotten that we needed to ask for...garlic sauce, miso soup, rice, refills on water.  Our last item was the S'mores which were delicious.  My sweet lovin' teeth concurs.    I know our server didn't mean to suck because he was totally awesome in the end when his station slowed down.  He was gracious all throughout the meal and we will be back.    Gyu-kaku is definitely fun and a good place for a delicious meal.",

Ive never liked the whole concept of cooking your own food, but im currently on a trying new things kinda spree. We were seated at this big booth and greeted by our waiter, she was awesome! Then we got our menu, it was a bit overwhelming with all the choices but we decided to do course menu despite it was happy hour. We decided to do meat lovers course and the 4 of a kind course, there was so much food! The meat came marinated and seasoned amazingly and it was really fun cooking while eating. Im a fan. Also try the Coral Reef drink! Heaven in your mouth! Im a fan of lychee and if you are too youll love this. We ended the dinner with smores. It was a good night and a great place.",

We ordered off the happy hour menu and we had ordered the shio ramen as well.  The shio ramen was incredibly bland; I used to work in a ramen restaurant for two years and I have been to countless other restaurants that serve ramen but this ramen was by far the worse ramen I've ever had. Save your 7 dollars or so and get some more BBQ that's for sure...  The meat itself for the BBQ was quite delicious. Some pieces of the toro beef were incredibly dry and hard to chew. I'd say try the other meats they offer instead (I can't remember their names right now).  My friend and I had the s'mores for dessert and it was delicious and a great experience.  Our total bill came out to be around 70 dollars for dinner for two hungry girls. Neither one of us had drinks, but we did get ramen along with the BBQ. Overall, too pricey for the experience and food quality. I probably won't be returning to this location, but like I said, the service was 5 stars, everything else wasn't.",

I do like the plain meat at Tofu Hut too but the seasoning at Gyu Kaku has a different kick to the meat. Love the grill and the temperature of it. This is the best grill I have used so far. Miso soup included in the group selection that we picked. It is small but it's comfortable. Overall the atmosphere is high end and not in the hole even when the Decatur x Spring Mountain is in the hole corner. Whoever did the decoration did a pretty good job. Come at night inside and you won't see Spring Mountain as an in the hole street.  Happy Hours are good hours, but Lunch hours are Very Happy Hours. It's $8 to start for the lunch and that's with 3 meat, salad, miso, and rice. Yeh!!! Awesomely Happy. With the 10% local discount, it's Screaming Happy. AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!",

We ordered a bunch of the \"hot apps\" - honestly, was not that impressed with this part of the menu. Calamari was kind of blah, the salad was nothing impressive. We had high hopes for the fried bacon chips. And they were fine, not amazing.   Do not be discouraged- This was a small speed bump in an over-all great night. The fun really began when we started getting the food that we cook at the small gas grill in the middle of the table! The marinades are awesome, the process is perfect for interactions, conversation, and nibbling! LOVED the Pork Belly and short ribs! The Garlic shrimp was great too- Order a couple, there are only 4. We threw some asparagus and shishito peppers on, YUM!  Plus a bunch of other meats.   This is a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner or a small group of friends. A great addition to the LV!  Here is my tip- Ask for the Happy Hour menu! It is from 6PM-10:30PM  Same food, just a little break on the price.",

We tried a little of everything, but the stand outs for me were the spicy kalbi ramen, the garlic fried chicken, and the spicy pork. I think the ramen here is actually better than most ramen houses in the city, if not all. The broth was perfect and flavorful, the meat is tender and not fatty, and the egg was perfect. The garlic fried chicken comes with this spicy sauce that honestly should just be put on everything.   We tried the filet mignon which was ok, the new York strip that was actually really good, the edamame..which honestly is hard to mess up, the volcano roll...which isn't what it sounds like, and the bacon chips.   We'll definitely be back to try more.",

Once seated at our booth, taitress said it was her second day on the job and she was terrible.  I wasn't able to use my LivingSocial (all I had to do was order 2 more items to reach the $30 spending requirement) voucher but she kept ignoring our table (she would speed past us on her way to/from the kitchen).  I had to flag another waiter to get our water glasses refilled. - Monday: Andrew was a great waiter.  Finally able to use the LivingSocial voucher and it was happy hour. - I would only come back if: 1) it was happy hour and 2) I don't have that same first waitress.   - For now the place gets 1-star as it is pricey bbq (even during happy hour) but will adjust my rating up if future visit(s) are on par with waiter Andrew's service. - Tip to Management: If your voucher \"excludes Lunch Set Menus\" then Dinner Set Menus are fair game.  If you want to exclude that to, then add \"excludes Dinner Set Menus.\"",

We felt under dressed when we walked in. I was reassured once I noticed everyone there with the exception of hubby was Asian. The selection of meats was great. We ordered a couple of different meats and they were delicious. We also ordered seaweed, spinach and tuna poke, all delicious. Kimchee was ok but not spicy enough. Their spicy sauce also wasn't spicy enough but I didn't order any of their special sauces. Service was excellent and I enjoyed their drink specials. I really needed the staff's cooking advice and followed their directions exactly. I definitely will go back and next time we'll bring the kids.",

    "text": "My first time here ... we ordered the Gyu-Kaku meal for 2 people (actually fed 3 of us)... it included Gyu-Kaku salad, appetizers (2 of each) Tofu Nuggets, Pork Gyoza and Spicy Tuna Volcano , Mushrooms, Zucchini, Assorted raw meats (about 6 pieces of each) Chicken with basil, Skirt steak, Kalbi, Sirloin, Filet mignon, Raw shrimp (5 pieces), Sukiyaki Bibimbap (a little too much soy sauce so,it was salty) and a dessert special of Smores (you actually roast the marshmallows over the fire grill and build your own smore). You grill the raw meats and vegetables yourself and the waiter/waitress tells you how long to cook it for.  I must admit, I believe the Japanese way is very different than the Korean Bbq way to where they marinate the meats because all the meats were bland. They had a choice of 3 sauces in a glass jar: Ponzu (which was unexpectedly spicy), Spicy (idk what kind of sauce this was, it was just labeled spicy) and Sweet Soy. This combo meal was $60. The only items that were tasty to me were the Salad, Tofu Nuggets and Pork Gyoza. Service was excellent!!  I would return if the Korean Bbq places closed down permanently, guess I'm already spoiled when it comes to marinated meat and the way Kalbi should really taste... sorry guys, E for effort though...",

They were pretty stingy with the meat dishes and the flavor on the rest of the food was just disappointing overall. The ramen had an unpleasant flavor to it that I can't quite identity and the tuna was not particularly fresh and the rice wasn't crispy enough. It had a very fishy smell and taste that I found unappealing. The pork belly wasn't fatty enough and kept sticking to the grill.

I went to reconfirm the wait time,  then I was told that they actually had a few reservations so the reserved customers had to be served first and that's why we and all other parties had to wait. The wait time actually turned out to be more than a hour. I understand that the reservations had to be served first, but the restaurant actually failed to mention about it when we arrived. The only reply that I received is that we just had to wait for another 20 mins, which is not True as well. As I stated earlier, we waited for more than a hour.

I can't believe I never came here before because the service was superb and everything in our dining experience from the moment we stepped in was excellent. The hosts were so energetic and welcomed us with a great big smile and made us feel right at home. Our servers were so helpful and told us about new items which they recommended. I absolutely loved the tuna poke nachos and the bistro! The meat was all so flavorful and juicy and came super quick. This store has been around for a while but everything was clean and organized. The managers even came by to check up on us and make sure we were having a good experience and that made our experience that much more better. The cocktails were very flavorful and just what we needed to wash down all that meaty goodness. This is most definitely a place I will be recommending to all my friends and family and I cannot wait to come back! Despite how busy it was they made us feel right at home and I felt nothing but good vibes here. I think I just found my favorite spot and will for sure be back again to be able to experience this fantastic dining experience once again.",

I would have never made an effort to stop and eat here but my cousin invited to me over for his birthday dinner.   I don't like the outside set up. The front is facing the street and parking is on the side and back of the building. When I first walked inn, I was surpise to see how well this BBQ place was set up. They had so many places to sit.   I'm giving them 5 stars because our server was great. We were a party of 30 peoples and he was on top of it. Very friendly and kept up with everyones orders.   Most the food sizes are small but, it goes great with their small griller. I enjoyed the food and I wouldn't mind coming back again.",

    "text": "Gyu-Kaku was my favorite spot for yakiniku back in Japan..I do like korean BBQ but there's something about Japanese style BBQ that I just love (eh probably biased because I am from Japan). I came here on a Monday night for their happy hour where selected meat/veggies are $1-2 cheaper than its original price.   ATMOSPHERE Very impressed with the atmosphere and interior. As opposed to the wooden benches/table and casual vibe of Gyu-Kaku in Japan, this place seemed more luxurious/fancy/modern. It made me wonder if Gyu-Kaku here incorporated Vegas's nightclub/flashy vibe to it. They have this cool lit entrance that makes you feel like you are walking on a red carpet for Grammy Awards. Interesting that they even have a bar..atmosphere here is way too cool for a BBQ restaurant.   SERVICE Service was excellent here. All the staffs here are energetic and attentive. Our server named Ryan was beyond fantastic. Since it was my first time at this location, he gave us suggestions, explained different sauces and the cooking time for specific meat. I was impressed with his enthusiasm and knowledge.  FOOD Good quality meat but kinda pricey for such a small portion in my opinion. I guess it's more about the quality over quantity here because meat was actually really good. I believe I got a Toro Shabu  which was thinly sliced beef and horumon which was my first time trying. 3 sauces they had were ponzu, spicy and sweet soy (?), I personally enjoyed dipping in the ponzu. Ponzu was citrusy and very refreshing, complimented the meat well.   CONCLUSION Will be back again for their happy hours!  [Edited to add] Second time around, completely ignored. Even though we had 3 servers walking by us/making eye contact, they acted as if we were not there. Finally after a good 10-20 mins, one of the servers came up to us only to tell us that kitchen is closed. First of all, why do you even have a poster around the entire restaurant which states happy hour is until 1AM. We were there around 12:30AM.. Yeah, if you guys didn't ignore us, maybe the kitchen wouldn't have been closed? Taking a star off. Extremely disappointed in you, Gyukaku.",

    "text": "More like a 3.5 for our particular experiences here, but not good enough to round up for. Service is good and most dishes here are decent, but I found it telling that both the BF and I enjoyed the apps more than the actual meats we got here.  Definitely start with the SPICY CABBAGE SALAD, skip the miso soup. The \"spicy tuna volcano\" (AKA spicy tuna crispy rice, $4 for 4 pieces during HH) was not as good as others in town, but the shrimp ponzu tacos were crispy and adventurous.  As for the meats: choose 3/person and add a bowl of the GARLIC RICE to share. I love that it's served in stone bowl to crisp up and tossed tableside. Definitely get the TONGUE WITH SCALLION SAUCE and the GARLIC SHRIMP ($4 for 4 shrimp, currently on special, regularly $7). If you don't like garlic and onions, maybe don't bother because those were the best dishes.  Other solid options were the spicy gochugang pork belly, bistro hangar steak, toro beef, and basil chicken- all good but not great, smaller portions than other similar style restaurants for similar prices.   Seems to be more of a place to go with a group and drink while lingering over the food, rather than as a date. The pre-set meals are well-priced for what you get, but they don't allow any substitutions. I don't see myself coming back outside of HH.",

I somehow always end up with Soo and Steven to host my table, and they are AMAZING. Soo even cooks for us when we are burning our meats!   Their happy hour deals are unbeatable, probably the best prices for beer and cocktails in town, even though I wish their cocktails are stronger.   I hope they get busier and stay in business even with all those new competitors around them!",

    "text": "Sigh... another place that seems like a tourist trap that lures people in with a snazzy outside and atmosphere. Its japanese barbecue I can tell you that, but it aint that good. Place is dirty too. Its unnoticeable, but its there. The food there is expensive and extremely unsatisfying. Service isnt good either.  Ill start off what matters to me: food because we all love it. The meat is barely okay and priced at a plate of 6 pieces of tuna sashimi from Las Vegas. Its just not good. I got a decent variety of things there that I cant remember the names of and all I know it wasnt good.  The service seemed like a joke. I waved a dozen times and even spoke up to the waiters with common phrases like \"excuse me\" which escalated to \"hey, man cmon\", but nothing came up after 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of stuggling to get attention from a waiter thats walking up in down with nothing in his hand everytime, he made eye contact with me as I raised my tired hand like an attaenna reaching for the heavens. EYE CONTACT WITH ME WAVING AT HIM. Even then I got no service. 5 minutes later I got their attention after leaning out of my booth raising my hand.  The environment is dim, so thats nice and relaxing, but looks can be deceiving. I was just sitting there forcing myself into thinking the expensive meat I had ordered was good and I noticed someone cleaning a table. Nothing to look at really, but as I eat my bbq I catch something in my peripheral vision. The person cleans the bottom the table first and uses the same rag, without any rinsing, to clean the top. The place has tabletop grills, so the bottom is naturally going to be dirtier than the top. Then I drop a peice of over priced meat on the table and was forced into throwing it away after seeing such a thing. Finally, they had music playing. Not any other music, but music youd hear from the first two DDRS. I think I even heard Butterfly play. Its humorous for a place that tries to be elegant with dim lighting and a lot of partitions.  As I sip my cup of refreshing water, I gazed upon something I wish I hadnt noticed. There was dirt floating to the top of my water. \"Oh. Just don't get water here then\" is what I thought, but then I looked more closely into the cup. What i thought made my drink filthy was the ice. I almost puked thinking of the idea of literally everyone in the place with ice in their drinks having a chance of getting ill from a restaurants carelessness. So I decided to get a drink without ice, but woah... dirt was still there. So it mustve been the dishes being carelessly cleaned. I genuinely wonder how clean the back of the house is now.  Pros: they sure know how to hide dirt with dim lighting, and a neat enterance.  Cons: dirty place, bad service, and mediocre food.  Advice: bring your dance pants to get jiggy with the music, reach out of your booth to get someones attention, and try to inspect your cup or plates for any filth.  Im not much of a complainer at all, but I feel like Ashton Kutcher was waiting for me to leave so he can pop out telling me I got Punkd as he points to various plants claiming there was a camera in it.  In fairness I couldve just come at the wrong day at the wrong time.",

Fabulous dishes, great flavor and loved the prices.  Shane made our day.  We have gone back 3 times this week.  The Manage Sheri Lynn is attentive and checked on us often.

    "text": "I discovered this place while I was on vaca in Hawaii. I was so excited to find that there was one in vegas. Originally I was going to give a 4 star review, but the hostess was so bad, she cost them a star. As I walked in she was texting on her cellphone, openly. She rudely insisted that she could seat my party until they were all here, even tho I said they were parking the car and walking in. She showed us the table and literally dropped the menus at the table. When I made the reservation I specified I needed a hair chair so before she left I requested a highchair. She barely glanced back and said they don't have highchairs they have boosters.  My son cannot sit up by himself yet, so he could not use the booster. This is a Japanese BBQ place, so I could not assist with cooking, I had to hold my son throughout my dinner.   Besides the useless hostess, the food is amazing here. The happy hour will only give you about a dollar off, but considering how many dishes you typically order, it's worth it. Don't be cheap with the meat! The hanger steak is about $7 but totally worth ordering at least 3 servings!  I went back in a few months later per the request of Aki, the VP. The \"manager\" Tracy was so resistant to help us. She only stopped by to review the bill embarrassingly in front of my guests. Tracy felt that a $12 discount compensating for my previous experience. That's ok. I won't have to waste anymore time or money at that place.",

I've tried their deep fried bacon, cheesy wonton things, noodles and their lunch special . I guess you can say it's expensive, but worth the money . It was  delicious . Their meat has a lot of flavor. The cooking does take some time tho, depending on what you get .. Like the fish products (salmon, miso butter fish) . So order those if you have patience !!",

Saturday 4/7 12 In my party and we ordered the all you can eat package and they will only give us 1 plate of each kind of meat. They brought out 2 kinds of meat at a time. How can we split a small plate of meat for 12??? I spoke to the server and he said there should be 2person to split 1 plate of meat, that right there we are already short of meat because we should be getting 4plates per meat so equally divided per couple. He insisted they cannot bring more meat until he called the manager... not sure if the manager understood the situation but he just simply asked \"so do just want more meat?\" Well, that's not the point. If there's 12 of us there should be 4plates of meat to split per couple but you guys keep serving us 1 plate... eventually they kept bringing us more food. No paying customer should experience this that you have to beg and ask and somewhat argue to get the right amount of food in which we paid in good amount. We spent almost $500 with alcohol every time we go there. Never again. The floor was sticky, the hot sake vary in temperature depends on how long the microwave it... (yes! They nuke your sake) the manager needs to improve his attitude and his management skills or this place will go down the drain.",

Eight of us came for dinner and were seated quickly without needing a reservation.  The staff is very friendly here and our waitress explained the menu and all of the options available for our meal.  The Harami Skirt Steak is currently a promotional item at 50% off the regular price per order.  We shared several different items including the skirt steak special, Bistro Hanger Steak, Garlic Shrimp, Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus, Spinach Garlic, Shisito Peppers, Fried Bacon Chips, Edamame, and Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap. There were two charcoal grills for our party, one for four people each, and the guys did the bbq'ing for the gals.  I really enjoyed the Harami Skirt Steak as it had a great miso flavor and no extra sauce was necessary for seasoning.  It was also my first time having bibimbap and I loved it. Those two dishes are ones that I'd definitely have again. This is a great place to come with your friends so you can share lots of different menu items and socialize over some good food.  Gyu-Kaku also offers \"BBQ Courses,\" specials for two people that start at $55 and include many menu items from appetizers to entrees to dessert, a value over ordering a la carte; I think we may try that the next time around when we're hungrier.  I've heard the Happy Hour is also good, but we'll have to wait a couple of weeks for that to start, according to the staff.  We'll be back!",

I love the concept of sitting around a table grilling your dinner and sharing with friends!  This place can easily be the scene of an intimate dinner for 2 or a large group which we happen to be on this occasion.   Upon entering you are warmly greeted by the host and on this visit our large group was seated promptly. The place is nicely designed and the atmosphere is fresh and welcoming.   There are so many choices and the pricing is very reasonable. You can do a la cart or enjoy their course menu.  We tried their special of the day which was Harami Skirt Steak, and we also ordered their Bistro Hanger Steak, Shishito peppers, bacon wrapped asparagus and their Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap.   All were delicious but my favorite of the night was the Harami Steak which was so tender and made for the best grilled meat in my opinion.   Our server was very attentive and informative.  She changed our grill a couple of times and she made her presence known to us throughout our time here ensuring all was good. She really added to the dining experience and had no problem splitting up our checks.     They apparently hold a high standard here in both food and service as it shows, and just to make sure all is in order and they are in compliance they ask you to fill out a survey after your meal.     I look forward to dining here again and enjoying another wonderful experience alike.",

    "text": "As a Japanese transplant, it's funny to see that Gyu-kaku is perceived as a cool yakiniku chain in the US. The bar area looks like... well, a bar, even...  That's for a reason - here in the US beef is obtainable cheaper than in Japan, which makes it possible that Gyu-kaku offers higher quality beef without pricing really high like many other Japanese yakiniku-ya do.  Their execution is solid in fact - meat with decent quality, great service, cool ambience. I must admit that now I'm a fan. ;)",

There was a time I waited a few minutes and even stood in the dining area and no one noticed me.  Other than the hostesses, I absolutely love this place",

For one, the cheese wontons had a weird cheese dip for it when usually it would come with japanese mayo. This made me sad because it was one of my favorites at gyukaku. But overall, nothing beats the gyukaku back in Hawaii. I would still try this place again. I did go when they just opened so maybe it'll be different next time.",

    "text": "Gyu kaku is a chain restaurant that specializes in Japanese BBQ where you grill your own meats tableside. There are a variety of delicious meats and sides to choose from a la carte, or you can order a dinner set which is slightly cheaper.   For starters I ordered the fried bacon chips, good but a bit salty. I also ordered garlic bimbimbap to share. It was so delicious that we had to order another one. For the side veggies, broccoli and mushroom medley which are served with butter wrapped in tin foil to grill. The kimchee was pretty standard.   For the meat selections, I ordered the Japanese sausages served with whole grain mustard for dipping which were pretty good. Also Kalbi short ribs, filet mignon, yaki-shabu and the spicy pork were delicious. The garlic shrimp was way too salty, too much garlic salt! There are also 3 different dipping sauces for your meat to choose from - sweet soy, ponzu and spicy.   The restaurant has an app for you to earn points from your bill so that you can redeem them for entrees in the future. We had a great dining experience here and will definitely come back again.",

Monday's/Wednesday's they have happy hour all day....we enjoy the food so much we come any day we crave it. Their meats are full of flavor and marinated just right. They do have an AYCE menu but it's more cost effective to go with one of their combos. Last visit we actually did AYCE and actually ended up eating was less meat and paid more. Definitely suggest going online to OpenTable to make a reservation prior to, even if it's before you head down there. They're always busy on the weekends but very worth the wait.",

Things to steer away from: basil chicken, ice cream macaron sandwiches.   Yoshi was our waiter, and he was amazing.  Attentive, friendly, and Japanese!

Despite being famished, I did not think that the appetizer is outstanding. It had a crispy batter on the outside, but unremarkable flavors. We tried the filet mignon and yaki shabu. Both had tremendous flavors that we liked! For dessert, we had s'mores. They couldnt possibly mess up the packed graham crackers, hershey's milk chocolate and store-bought marshmallows, the cool thing though was toasting them in the restaurant!

I would highly recommend coming here on Monday or a Wednesday when they serve their happy hour menu all day. Their happy hour isn't just drinks but a good selection of meats and appetizers. I think this place is definitely worth for its happy hour prices , their regular prices are pretty expensive and that sht adds up quickly. They have an AYCE option (although more expensive than KBBQ AYCE) and your whole table needs to be doing that option too. From their happy hour menu I recommend ordering their Yaki shabu beef and toro beef. One of their cheaper options and actually still very very good. Bistro hanger steak is slightly more expensive than the other two but its another great option. Yet have to try their dessert options but I was waaay too full that time to order one.",

I usually don't eat rice at AYCE places but their beef sukiyaki bibimbap was so good, especially with the meats. The meat was tender and flavorful. What was even better was the service. RJ was super helpful and friendly. Definitely worth checking out if you visit Vegas. There's great food other then those on the strip.",

We waited for a half hour for them to \"clear a table\" when there were a good 4-5 tables that were completely free and clear from multiple groups who left while we waited. Then waited another 20 minutes for them to take our order. Then they turn on the grill, oil it and let it burn on high heat for another 15 min before the food arrived, the place was smoking like crazy!!!!! Hello servers, where's the common sense? Don't oil a grill until you're ready to put food on it. We had to turn down the temperature on our own because we couldn't breathe through all the smoke. Seriously worse experience here and we're Gyu-Kaku regulars where we're from. Never coming here again.",

    "text": "Food here is delicious, prices are moderate. Gyu-kaku is a Japanese bbq grill where you are served raw marinated meat and cook the food yourself on a gas/charcoal grill build into the table. The decor here is very intimate. Lots of seats and dim lighting, tables are close together but the dim lighting give you a sense of privacy. Monday and Wednesday they have ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR. They have happy hour food deals and $10 pitchers of Sapporo ( about 6-7 glasses) and $8 jumbo house sake. Food here is good. My table ordered the happy hour dinner for 2, it was $50 for an assortment of appetizers, meats, and s'mores as dessert. I recommend upgrading the ride to bimibop for extra $3. The meat is marinated well and they have ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy sauces at each table (the spicy sauce was my favorite, it's more sweet than spicy). You have to cook your own food and I recommend someone to keep an eye on the food because most meats cook faster than you think. Overall, food here is good, service was good but nothing spectacular, the bill can add up if you're ordering with your eyes and not your stomach. I recommend anyone to try but I can't see myself eating here more than once every 5-6 months.",

His name is Ken. He checked on our table very often which made up for our first time experience. The food quality was very good but most of it was salty, even the Addicting Cabbage Salad.

From what I remember, the Gyus I've been to in LA served just beer and sake. This would be a great place to come and watch a game while sippin on an Old Fashioned or havin a couple beers and some finger food.   Menu hasn't changed much. They still have happy hour all day except from 6PM-8PM. Their lunch sets are great. Rice, salad, miso soup, and two types of selected meats for just $10 is a great deal, and the lunch sets are available from 12PM-4PM. They still have the big sets if you wanna bring a large group and get down and rowdy. I feel like they go overboard with the marinade sometimes, but I'll just ask for the meats plain next time. The sukiyaki bibimbap is as good as I remember it to be.  Vegas has definitely upped its BBQ game, bringing in Gyu-kaku and an abundance of other Korean bbq spots. I've been to Gyu-kaku so many times in SoCal that I feel like I've been Gyu-Kaku'd out. I will probably want to check out Hobak or Magal before coming back here.",

The 30 minute wait actually turned out to be just 10 minutes and we were taken to the table. We decided to get the ultimate all you can eat option, which had a good variety of items. Victoria was our server and despite being super busy, she checked on us on a timely manner and was smiling the whole time. My friends and I felt like we were being one of those annoying needy customers (requesting random stuff) but she assured us that it is totally fine. She did everything and more to meet our needs making the experience a super positive one. She is super friendly! If you have her a server when you come, just know that your night will for sure be a great one! I personally won't come back for awhile just because I am not a super big fan of meat but my friends are. The only thing I wish was that they had more options seafood wise. I know it is weird to wish for that a BBQ place, but it would be nice to mayve have just a few more options.",

Our whole party got the $42 All You Can Eat and may I say, it was soooo worth it! RJ was our server and was amazing. Although it was super busy, he never missed a beat. We were on a 90 minute timer to order and eat our food and by the time we finished, we almost exploded by how full every single one of us were.   The quality of the meat is AMAZING & you must try the Spicy Tuna Volcano!

The meats were very flavorful, tender and delicious. Now let's move on to the service. When we arrived, we literally stood there for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged that we were there. Second our service at the table was horrible. Anyone that knows me, knows I value customer service. We had to ask for spoons, sweeteners, forks, and napkins repeatedly. It took 20 minutes before we actually saw those items. I had to ask a bus person finally. When the waiter spilled my drink on me, I blew it off. Accidents happen right? But from that moment on, everything went down hill. They took forever bringing the food out to us. Given the fact it was a little busy, we blew that off too. But the worst part of it all.... wait for it ... we had to wait 40 minutes for our checks to get right. And when I say get right, he came to us and asked how we were paying. We had to split it 3 ways. Our waiter literally acted as if we asked for something illegal. He went away to \"handle \" our check. He was gone for 25 minutes. 25 minutes!! It finally took a manager to go over there and help him with the check. Then they had the nerve to add on another $14 per group for gratuity. That's $42 in tip for poor and I mean extremely poor service. Needless to say, thanks to my friend we had that taken off. Normally I would give a place a second chance but we will definitely not be going back to this place!",

    "text": "On my usual rounds of scrolling through facebook, I saw that my friend was at his favorite place in Vegas to eat (gyukaku) and immediately wondered why I haven't been back in a year. I realized why which i'll get to later in the review.  Setting: In a fairly large and quiet plaza by the vietnamese market and near the smokin crawfish restaurant. When you see this place you almost get the feeling why something that looks so nice be located here? Bright white lights and modern decor make it out to be a high class establishment so taking a date here would definitely give the impression of quality.   Choosing your food: You can go a la carte or choose the set meals they offer. Personally I think choosing the set is your best bet for the first time and choosing a la carte the second visit when you know which meats are right for you.   Meats: They offer several cuts of meat and prepared with different types of marinades which is a big problem for me. All of the meat is in some type of sauce and seasoning which overburdens the meat and ruins its True flavors. Yeah I know some meats are suppose to be marinated (kalbi, bulgogi, etc) but all of their meats seem to be soaking in sauce. I think we can all agree that marbled meat is the best meat. The beef items that we got on the meat lovers seemed pretty tough and chewy which is a big disappointment.   Happy Hour: All day monday and wednesday is pretty sweet! A good amount of the items on the menu are about $1 some $2 off. A mug of sapporo during the summer happy hour was only $1.50.   Overall: I think it's a cool place to go for a nice evening of drinking, grilling, and chatting with a group of people, but all the meat being marinated and pretty tough fails to want me to come again for food.",

It was great and everything. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they don't specifically let you know what is SUPER HAPPY HOUR and what is REGULAR HAPPY HOUR.  My friends and I went in specifically for the miso soup during happy hour, because I saw it was going to be 99 cents. What I didn't understand was that I guess it was for SUPER HAPPY HOUR which is all day monday and wednesday but tuesday its after 11 - last call. I just wish they were more specific about that. Other than that tho the deals are a steal, especially the 3 dollar BOGO shot of vodka. That shot is like 2 shots worth ALONE. Anyways I recommend going here but just remember what is actually happy hour and what is SUPER happy hour.",

There is a subtle difference, and there are far too many of the latter, not enough of the former in America.    But that's the only good thing I'll say about it.  Food was terrible.  I mean, I really don't know how you screw up raw meat and dipping sauce, but they managed.  Pork belly was inedible; had a funny taste, like it had been washed in soapy water or something.  Beef was flavorless and tough.  Only three dipping sauces, and not a one tasted decent (okay... the Ponzu was alright.  Nothing special, but not nearly as terrible as their Sweet or Spicy Shoyu).  Rice was mushy.  The night I went, they were also out of mixers for half their cocktails, which is inexcusable from a restaurant that's directly across the street from a grocery store.    Maybe for locals who've never traveled, the dining experience would be different enough they might enjoy it.  But for someone who's had the real thing, and can make better at home, it's a waste of time and money.  Oh, and my stomach hurt for two hours after eating there; no clue what that was about, since I certainly didn't gorge myself.",

The entrance to this perceived Japanese   BBQ place is pretty amazing with its door framed lights, pretty befitting for it's placement in Las Vegas.   However I would be stretching it by saying it should be categorized as a Japanese BBQ restaurant. There was definitely a DIY BBQ pit in the center of the table, which is always the expectation but the menu was not what we expected. The quality of the meats were good but very thick cuts for BBQ beefs and the lean meats. Also everything came pre-marinaded, which is something definitely not Japanese like plus the marinades were all very sweet for my taste. There were also lots of Korean dishes that also were on the menu, I felt this place was more of a Korean Japanese inspired BBQ restaurant and really should be categorized that way.   Overall the service was great, quality of food good, happy hour is very reasonable, lots of speciality Asian inspired cocktails but undeniable not Japanese BBQ, it really missed it's mark by claiming itself as one.",

Explained everything and did NOT do that thing where you make fun of someone in another language but they know your talking about them. ;)  We ordered two of the combinations and it said it served 4 people. it was enough for 6. Next time we will just get 1 combination. They were Pork, Chicken and Beef. All the meat was fresh and nicely marinaded. The Kimchi is really good, best spicy fish cakes and seaweed salad I have had since I left the west coast. A nice environment for a gathering of family and close friends you don't mind eating after LOL. We will be back to try seafood.",

I've never had Japanese style BBQ before, and being a big fan of grilling your own food at a restaurant, I was excited to try out this spot.  Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.  Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.  The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.  Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.  The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.  I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.",

Our server \"Yoshi\" is Uber friendly as well.   Good recommendation of meat selection is really great.  I love the Harami skirt steak and the newly added Fried chicken wonton with Shiracha sauce.  All the other meats are flavorful and tender. Spicy tuna volcano is a big hit as well.  If you want great customer service from the servers all the way up to the highest level, this is the place to be.  Great food and drinks!",

I think the whole idea is fun, cooking your own perfectly seasoned food, but I did find it a bit pricey.   There are plenty of other Korean BBQ places that give you all you can eat for cheaper prices.  **For your birthday they sing to you and bring you ingredients to make smores:)",

    "text": "I love the whole idea gyu kaku has, the cook your own meats but the meats are also a lot better quality than most Korean BBQ around in Vegas. In fact I think this is the only Japanese BBQ and the pricing id say is $-$$ so not bad! Around 11 pm - close you best go in for their happy hour! A lot of the stuff is way cheaper and you can get way more appetizers or you can choose the combos where they come with all these picked meats for certain pricing. I love the ambience you never feel rushed to eat, but sometimes you feel the service is slow too. The customer service though has always been good everytime I eat here and at least they check up on us occasionally. I think the fact you take time to cook your food is what fills you up quicker. My favorite meats are the filet mignon, the Cajun shrimp, the butterfish, and the salmon (fish person much? I know lol.) anyways if you want dessert they also have macaron ice cream sandwiches! They're so cute haha and there's like 4 different flavors. I'd say you'd best take your date here or double date! It's the perfect place to go!",

Gyu-Kaku welcomes you with a grand entry way lit with lights, it definitely doesn't feel like I'm still in Vegas while walking in.  We were seated right away and our server explained the menu to us and suggested ordering off their course menus ($55-$77).  We opted for a la carte because we thought we'd save more money and be able to eat what we wanted, but our bill came out to $60 anyway.    We started off with the Asian Sangria in Apple.  It's made with Hana Sake, fruits, mandarin, orange, mint and sprite.  The sangria was fruity, refreshing, and delicious!  If you're looking for something to sip on that doesn't burn your throat, this is the winner!   Spicy Tuna Volcano: a block of rice that's fried with spicy tuna on top.  Although it's a best seller, I wouldn't order it again.  The rice was too fried and hard to chew. I've seen it executed better at ayce sushi.  Our server recommended 2 plates of meat and 2 plates of vegetables per person and an appetizer to be full.  I initially thought it was a lot of food, but I didn't realize how small the portions would be.    We ordered the Bistro Hanger Steak, Duck, and Angus Beef Ribs with the sauces that were recommended for each on the menu.  When we got our meats, I couldn't believe how fresh they looked, each plate came with 5-6 pieces of meat, so don't expect to get ayce full. It's more about the quality than quantity here.  I also enjoyed the 3 different sauces on the table that you could dip your meats in!  They also have additional sauces you can pay for to enhance the flavor of the meats, we decided to go with the Crunchy Garlic Sauce.  It's crunchy garlic in red chili oil, but with all the sauces at the table, I didn't find it necessary.  Everything had so much flavor already so no need to pay extra.    For vegetables, we got the Mushroom Medley, which came with Enoki, King Oyster, and Garlic Mushroom and Spinach Garlic.  Both were good additions to the meat.  They come in foil and you steam it on your grill alongside with the meat.     Rice isn't included in a la carte, so we ordered 2 bowls at $1.95 each.    I love how you don't smell like bbq afterwards and the service is beyond amazing!  I'll definitely be back to try their course menu and their HH menu which is from 5-6 pm and 10 pm-12 am.  Just be mindful that you're gonna have to pay a little more than you're used to, to get full.",

The NY Strip had too much untrimmed veiny fat for such a small portion.     The waiter was kind, friendly and knowledgeable.   However, I was splattered with the oil on the grill when he decided to change it for us.  I so wish he would have just left it alone.  My thick cotton A&F over-priced t-shirt and Nike fancy shorts looked like the coat on a Dalmatian.   It was just an accident.    Objectively the food was flavorful, however, there were too many sweet sauces, mayonnaise based dressing, average Miso soup and even during happy hour, the price was not worth the amount of food.    I certainly won't return.   However, if you like sweet flavored dressings, meats and freshly grilled items, then, you might have a good time.     The waiter was great; I'd hire him.  The food did not impress me.",

    "text": "There's some decent barbecue here. I first tried them in Waikiki and became a fan of this chain. The Vegas location is fairly large with plenty of tables and a long bar area, good for date nights or gatherings with friends and family. It's better to order a la carte instead of going with the meal deals, in my opinion, and skip stuff you may not really want like salad, soup and edamame. Proteins like the harm miso skirt steak and kale short rib don't take long to cook but can benefit from leaving them on the grill to get a little crispy around the edges. Other items we tried were seasoned well like the garlic shrimp and vegetables. The garlic rice, arriving in a stone pot, will get crispy when left in there. It's a larger portion that can be shared by two people. I loved the slivers of garlic mixed in with the rice.",

After sitting there, Brandon came and got us and sat us in a private room with so much space and area for my three small children. He was soooo attentive, patient, and explained everything in detail. The food was absolutely amazing to top it off. I had no idea he was the manager until after it was time for us to leave. What an example of great service for this company! He is an awesome representation of how to make a rocky start turn into an extraordinary experience. We left outdone!!!! What more can we say to get him recognized?

Definitely recommend the harami steak and the filet mignon - get the meat lover's combo for two if you love beef. Coupled with the included salad, karage, cheese wontons, miso soup and smores, we had more than enough food for two. Will come back. Mieko the waitress is great!",

    "text": "My brother and I had ordered the gyu-kaku course and it was delicious. Didn't really think it'd be enough for the both of us, but I ended up getting a food coma as if I had all you can eat kbbq. Starting from the appetizers, everything was so flavorful. You end up wondering just how good the next course will be. Photos are attached, but tbh, I was too excited to eat that I did not take as many as I had wanted to in the beginning.  As for service, I believe I counted around 5 that came to us, asking if we needed anything in the most polite manner.   The interior was beautiful, extracting older Japanese themes with a modern touch. My experience here seems very worthy of the 5 star rating I've given. I would note that the price is higher than your average casual dinner, but it is worth both the experience and the food.",
