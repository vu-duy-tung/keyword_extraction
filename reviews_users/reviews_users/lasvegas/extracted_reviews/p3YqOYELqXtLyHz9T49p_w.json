    "text": "Came to this place yesterday because this was supposed to be the new and updated hot n juicy . Walked in when tables were full with no one in line . A couple groups came in after us and I guess there was a discrepancy where one waiter was gonna skip us when we were actually next . Got to our table our waiter was a male and he was kind of rushing . My friend had been there recently before but it had been a while for me . I wanted to ask him about the different seafood specifically the crawfish. He said they didn't have live only frozen and said there was a bit of a taste difference . After going back and fourth about the pros and cons of frozen vs live he finally said they could give us a sample . He brought us water and didn't come back for about 15 minutes to take our order. I told him I wanted to order when we had our sample and he looked like he forgot about our sample altogether. When he finally brought it out the crawfish was dry. It had no sauce or anything it tasted like they microwaved it and put it in a bowl with nothing on it. Hard pass. I ordered the shrimp instead. From the time we ordered to about 15 minutes after our food came our waiter was MIA . We flagged down the 'lead server' SELINA multiple times to retrieve our waiter each time she said he was 'busy' the last time she copped THE WORST attitude and said 'he's busy and I'm your server now what do you need' I couldn't believe her attitude . We didn't get a bucket for our shells . Our waters were empty it was THE WORST experience . I was also having trouble peeling the shell off my shrimp and I asked SELINA if she knew a better way to peel them and she rudely said 'we don't offer that here' Seriously ? Then I repeat my question and she again gave THE WORST ATTITUDE IVE EVER GOTTEN FROM A SERVER . She said 'oh you need ME to show you how I do it' ? As if she was being sarcastic about me needing her help . After that our original server started showing up again . And by then I was COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR SERVICE. I don't know what she was going through or how our table caught the brunt of SELINA'S attitude but I promise I will NEVER come here as long as she is working there .",

There were people at almost every table but it was only a couple of minutes before we were seated.   They have plastic on all the tables. They give you a bucket, bib, and gloves because it gets pretty messy.   I ordered a pound of shrimp with two small red potatoes. I had hot and juicy seasoning in spicy. My shrimp had eyes, ears, tails, and all that good stuff. As delicious as it was having to peel all the shrimp was time consuming and annoying. Sometimes you just wanna hurry and get to your food. The peeling slowed me down but I still enjoyed the flavor of the shrimp and potatoes.   The prices here are great. They have other choices of seafood as well.   I would return but it's not a number one priority. When in the mood for seafood and I don't mind a little extra work I'd stop in.",

    "text": "Heaven in a bag!!!!   Wow. I'm a huge seafood lover and just had to try this place out.  Best shrimp I've ever had!  The garlicky Cajun sauce is TO DIE FOR!!!  I could eat it on anything!  I do, however have a HUGE complaint - their service.  We came around 4:30 before the rush hour dinner crowd arrived.  We were seated and our order was taken.  Fast forward 45 minutes and the place started to fill up and people who arrived 20-30 minutes after us placed their orders and were already eating and we still didn't even have our drinks!  We beckoned a server over (because we didn't know who our waiter/waitress was since 3 different people had come to our table) and asked why we haven't yet been tended to.  She looked into it and said that our orders had not been put into the computer so they were going to discount our tab to compensate and that a manager was going to come speak to us about it.  Soon after our meals were served, however, it was delivered to us piece-meal.  We had to remind her twice what items we were missing.  While we were dining, no one checked on us during our meal so we had to continue to flag her down to get refills on our drinks.  No manager had come, as promised, and when our bill came, it was not discounted and once again we had to remind her that no one came to discuss the bill with us and that it was not discounted either.  Thank GOD the food was amazing because if I were to base my review on service alone, this place would receive zero stars.  I could probably give it closer to 5 stars but bad service taints ones eating enjoyment and needless to say the food probably would have been that much better had I not been so upset about the subpar service.",

I ordered the hot and juicy mild crawfish and garlic shrimp. Boy was it tasty. You definitely are going to need gloves to tear these guys apart, as they are saturated with the sauces. DONT BE AFRAID to get down and dirty. Personally, I enjoyed the shrimp more because there is a lot more meat, they are healthy shrimp. The crawfish have tiny tails but are equally as tasty. If you are going solely to eat the crawfish and have a big appetite, you're going to need a few pounds of those bad boys. Overall, great experience and will be back soon, hopefully visiting the California location.",

Hot N Juicy was reccommended by a few friends that found this gem while visiting Vegas and being a big seafood lover I said it was a must.  So glad I tried it! We ordered 3lbs of *spicy* seasoned crawfish, spicy sausage, and white rice. They weren't kidding when they said SPICY. My nose was running and my eyes were tearing up, but I kept eating because it became an addiction to me. That hot n juicy of it was so powerful I couldn't let go.  We had great service, all 3 of the employees that serve was were friendly.  I wish we had a HOT N JUICY in CHICAGO! Yummmm!",

    "text": "H-N-J was good but not the best bag seafood that I've had....    We came on a Sunday with a hungry party of 5. No, line and we were instantly greeted and seated.   Like the real rocket scientists that we are, we ordered a large sample of the menu:  2lbs Snow Crab 2lbs King Crab 3lbs Shrimp 2lbs Craw-fish  The seafood was quality; no complaints on the size or freshness of our feed. My beef is with the seasoning. I've been to many a boil bag seafood places and was blown away by the taste. Yes, there was alot of sauce but for some reason none of it stuck with the meat?!? Once the seafood was extracted, shucked, cracked, peeled or decapitated, there was not much taste left?!?  Maybe they didn't let our stuff soak long enough in the bag? I know that it's possible because I've eaten at other places and the sauce penetrated (hehe) the shells and soaked into the meat. So yah it was a bit of a disappointment for me.   Questions: Why do they only serve corn and potato with the crawfish? (notice the singulars) I wish that they offered it with all of their bags. When we drop $200 + on a seafood feast, that's the last that can can do. How do you decide who get the one potato or corn among 5 people? Don't nickel and dime us when we are spending mad money here.   Why do they not have mixed bags? I think it's a bummer if you want to sample everything and didn't bring a large enough party.  Maybe we will try the one across the street to compare. Maybe...  Sorry fellow Vegas Elites I must go against the grain on this one...   Up to you but Pat no approve...",

We got 4 pounds of snow crab, 1 pound of skrimps, and 1 pound of crawfish. I opt for the medium hot n juicy special for the seasoning. I saw white rice on the menu. WOOT!!! I'm not sure if they always served white rice here. I remembered asking for it at the original spot and got denied. Maybe they ran out back then. I was so glad to see it on the menu. I saw some cat post up a picture of rice that had the seasoning poured all over it. FOR REALLY DOE!!!  Not very long after I was stuffing my face like a pig, the spice started to make me sweat, but I couldn't stop eating. Believe me, it was an ugly sight. Pieces of shell all on my grill, juice running down my arms, beads of sweat forming on my cranium, crab meat chillen on the upper lip...YO!  Both places have GREAT flavor, although Hot N Juicy's medium spice got it on LOCK DOWN!!! Doesn't need no more or no less. Keep doing it yallz! EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!",

I like this place better then boiling crab because it's WAY less oily and the flavor is more intense.   1 bad thing is that they are always out of blue crab and dungeness crab by late afternoon.    I always get at least 2 lbs of crawfish, HOT N'Juicy special (do not say whole shabang, the staff doesn't like that) Xtra Spicy... and I mean I like things spicy but they can never get it to where my nose is watering and my mouth is on fire... I guess thats better for my ulcer.  Staff works as a team and they are usually really good about refills and getting your order out to you quickly.    I always need to be near a bathroom 1-3 hrs after eating at Hot N Juicy though... if ya know what I mean...",

We ordered a side of Cajun fries since the boyfriend doesn't like sweet potato fries.   Overall, the food wasn't as spectacular a I hoped it would be. Maybe I'm a bit biased since we go to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area.   The sauce reminded me of a lemon butter sauce with a hint of curry. Even though we ordered mild, it was still spicy.   The Cajun fries were just regular potato fries and a bunch of Cajun powder dumped on top. Made the top fries spicy and the bottom fries bland.   The shrimp had too much batter and difficult to chew.   But the service and music are pretty good. Plus two stars for that.",

Our food came out quick and hot. Everything was delicious! What I love most about this place is that the shrimp are huge and the hot n juicy sauce is amazing. In addition, the prices are reasonable.

    "text": "My wife has always loved this place, and she loves the 1 pound of hot n juicy shrimp, but she was disappointed because the sauce was thinner and less flavorful.   I always get the calamari basket and it's always crispy and tasty, only this time the portion was tiny. (And it wasn't as crispy and it had very little flavor on top of that.) I asked about it and was told it's the same as always (it wasn't), but the guy was nice and gave me a discount. I didn't want a discount, I wanted the same portion size they used to serve. I like it with cocktail sauce and it used to be I used the whole cup of sauce and then some, but this time I barely used up half the cup. It seems to me the serving size now is appetizer sized whereas it was meal sized before, at the same price.   When I paid, this same guy asked how it was. I'm not going to say \"great\" just to say that. Now he became feisty, even though I wasn't being rude or obnoxious. He told me the servings are prepackaged and it's the same as always, and he didn't want to hear that it was smaller. \"I'm just telling you how it is,\" he said. \"So I'm lying?\" \"No, I'm just telling you how it is.\" Really, this is how to talk to a customer? You don't say \"I'm just telling you how it is.\" I might have given them a second chance down the road, but not now. I'm never going back. I've ordered the same thing probably the last eight times I've been there going back the last two years, and I know what the portion used to be and what it is now. I can't remember the last time I was this angry leaving a restaurant. There's something like three or more identical restaurants in the city, and this place has lowered their standards way too much to ever return.",

    "text": "Great seafood restaurant for family and friends. Depending on time of day but dinner time it usually is busy so expect to wait for a bit for a table.  Pretty simple menu to read and they offer a few selection of seafood by the pound. It depends how much based on the market price of the day but it is not too bad.   First you order what seafood you want and how many pounds. Usually a pound or 2 is good per person. Next is the type of seasoning and then the spice level. Servers usually warn you that the medium spice level is kind of spicy.   There is also a back side of the menu where they offer sides such as corn, rice, rolls etc. They also offer domestic and premium beers as well.  I usually order a pound of shrimp and their hot n juicy sauce which is a combination of all their sauces mixed together. I also order a corn mixed with the sauce and side of sweet potato fries.  The seafood you order delivers in a hot bag with the sauce of your choice. The shrimp you have to peel the skin yourself which makes the experience fun and enjoyable. You could also ask for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to add a little more taste to your food.   If you don't like getting messy, they have gloves you can use and oh they also give you a plastic bib too so you won't make a mess on your shirt because it could get messy.  There is a huge roll of paper towel so there is plenty to go around if you need to clean up.   Overall the food taste great. Came out in a reasonable amount of time. Food is nice and hot. Our drinks were always topped off.  Thanks!",

We live in NC and he had no idea our friends were meeting us in Vegas. Anna was phenomenal in helping to plan, down to the moment that we arrived and helped keep the surprise going until we were led upstairs to a private area where our group surprised my husband.   Food is fantastic as always! Whenever we can find a hot and juicy when we travel, we make sure to visit. Our server Azi was very attentive and took care of every single one of our needs with a smile! #Great staff #wonderfulexperience. #happycampers",

I really like Hot N Juicy because all of their restaurants are SO CONSISTENT. East to West everything is well managed and the food is always AMAZING!  I love the sauce at Hot N Juicy, it is definately in the Top 3 in my crawfish eating adventures. I love the ratio of sour, cajun and just heavenly goodness. You can never go with the crawfish here, they are fresh, good sized and perfectly cooked! If anything is off, just let your server know and they'll take care of it.   Love their baskets as well, catfish is plentiful.. and kind of tastes like cod in my opinion... weird... I was expecting fishy! It's ok cod is good too. The fries they have are better than Boiling Crab because they are more starchy and taste more real! Love dunking fries in Ranch sauce. I'm not much of a fan of Gulf Oysters, but my company sure loved them, they were really plump and a nice medium size. Oh and Hot N Juicy is the ONLY crawfish place that has  The place is really messy though, that's my one complaint, I know they're busy but still at least wipe down and sweep a little. We were literally sitting on oil and crawfish shells it was a bit weird... Service is awesome, everyone who works at Hot N Juicy is so upbeat and chill. Food is fast and communication between FOH and BOH is instant since they have good In-N-Out like headsets (it's pretty funny). This location is pretty big so big parties would fit, the ambiance is cozy and nice (not as trashy as BC).",

I give it a 4 stars because after eating the shrimp my stomach and all of my friends who ate the shrimp started to have stomach problems throughout the night. But other than that, food was not over cooked which I hate because if you over cook shrimp their skin tends to stick onto the meat so it's frustrating to peel. I would go here again but probably order something else other than shrimp. Would love to try the other seafood. Hoping my stomach would be okay.",

    "text": "After listening to my GF and her sister rant and rave about \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" in a manner that, I swear, included dilated pupils and a lil bit of drool coming from the corner of their mouths... I said, alright, if they place is so good, I'll take both of you there for lunch and it's my treat! Little did I know that this may be the most over priced restaurant in Las Vegas... And that's a fiercely competitive category.  First of all, if you're not into eating your overpriced Cajun style food from the same plastic bag it was cooked in, then you won't like this place.   Now, pleeeeeze don't get me wrong, all the food we ordered TASTED GREAT!!! Big time... Although I recommend either be Mild or Medium spiciness levels, since the mild is hotter than most restaurant's Medium. My crab legs were delicious although a pound of them yields about 2 ounces of actual crab meat. The sausage was fast and the only item not so grossly overpriced. The corn was just OK, and the beverages were not up to the standards of an average Wendy's. For three of us, with only a single beer, an iced tea and an Arnold Palmer for beverages, the total for three of us with tip came to $118.00 and was $97.22 before gratuity.   I am not a cheap diner, for example, I don't think twice about the cost of a Morton's or THE golden Steer or even the Fagao Do Chao Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas... But, they at least provide cutlery, silverware, genuine plates, cups, glasses, great service and keep your table fairly clean. Hot N Juicy brings your meal out in a plastic bag, warns you to put their chintzy and inadequate bib on to protect your clothing and wishes you the best of luck with only a seafood shell cracker and a plastic poker to dig the meat out of your food. Their napkins are not up to the task and look like the stuff used by high school cafeterias... Despite rudimentary service, a lack of utensils, throw away beverage containers and the overwhelming presence of enough plastic to cause a petrochemical shortage... And undersized portions... The food was as tasty as I was told... But no better prepared or quality than many other restaurants that provide dinnerware, utensils, cloth napkins, bibs that are OK for those bigger than a toddler and much better service.    My three star rating is justified by the excellent flavor and preparation, as well as fast service as they rush you to get out so they can turn the table and make more money... I envy the owner of this place because with a 15% food cost and no dish washing expenses, the menu prices must make this business a Hot N Juicy Cash Cow!",

Come early, like 5pm for dinner, or else the wait and parking is AWFUL. We arrived at 5:30 and parking was already terrible, we left at 6ish and the line outside was insanity. Parking was impossible. This place is not as big as it looks.  The food is great! I always get the shrimp in the original flavor, but one word of caution, IT IS SPICY! Yeah yeah I know, you like spicy but seriously. This is SPICY. My friend who is a spice lover even remarked that he thought it was a little too much at level 5. I got level 1 (yeah I know I'm a wimp) and my nose was running.  It gets messy as you have to peel the shrimp/crawfish/crabs yourself by hand. Everything is served in plastic bags and they do provide bibs and plastic gloves, but most just use their bare hands. Don't wear your best clothes.  This place is great, as long as you come early, or don't mind waiting. It's okay though, there are plenty of little shops nearby to shop in while you wait.",

A friend and I shared half a dozen oysters, a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, a pound of Alaskan king crab legs, and a pound+ of dungeness crab. We had no problem devouring all that. If price wasn't an issue we would have ordered more. Despite this chain's appearance of looking like a dive it isn't exactly cheap.   The king crab legs in the mild garlic butter sauce were the clear winners of the night. The dungeness crab was pretty tasty as well but required more work. I've never been much of a fan of crawfish. There's just too much work for so little meat. I'll stick to the other stuff next time.",

The answer is, \"Finger licking good!\" And let me tell you, Hot n Juicy is the definition of finger licking good cause I will always be licking my fingers afterwards!   This place is delicious. I moved out of Las Vegas for a period of time and whenever I visited this city, I always always always have to eat at Hot n Juicy at least ONCE. It is always a must! The flavors are unique and different. No, I didn't come here due to \"Man vs. Food\" .. in fact, I never watched that show. I came here because I heard it was good and their first location was ALWAYS packed! The wait is always humongous!   And yes, there are actually two locations and this one is their second location on Spring Mountain. It's newer so the decor is more modern and the ventilation should be a whole lot better than their first building.   So you don't like crawfish? That's fine. I don't really have a preference for them either. In fact, I think they're not really worth it. Each crawfish doesn't have much meat ... you'll be eating a few tons before you get full! Why? Well, Hot n Juicy sells it by the pound ... so with the little amount of actual edible goodness you get that comes in the huge clanky shells, you don't get much. But no worries! There is SHRIMP on the menu!! Of course, there's crab and whatnot on the menu too but that's not my concern. SHRIMP is my recommendation and it will fill you up for sure!!  So what they do is sell seafood by the pound. You get to choose a sauce and the spicyness level between mild and extra spicy. The shrimp is cooked in the sauce and they bring it to you in a plastic bags. Yes, it's different. Yes, you may not like being served food still in the bag. Sure, you may not like using your hands and they got plastic gloves for you folks. But it is YUMMYLICIOUS. Prepare to get messy ;) It's honestly worth a try ... get adventurous once in a while. You never know what you'll come across!  I typically order 1 lb of shrimp. Hot n Juicy special. Add corn to that. As for the spicyness level, it depends on my mood. I have tried mild, medium, and spicy. Mild is the best and their mild is not the traditional mild. It's actually spicier than what people would consider mild. It is delicious with a little kick to it that gives it an oomph. Medium, to me, was very similar to the mild ... no real big difference. Now, spicy, that's the REAL kicker! It was SO GOOD. SO SPICY. SO FLAMING HOT. But honestly, go for the mild.   I usually also order the cajun fries. They used to make them as regular fries with cajun powder on top but now they've incorporated the two? Who knows how they go about it but it's pretty good.   So their sauces have a lot of garlic in them. You'll be eating and smelling garlic all night. Be sure you're a garlic lover! You'll even take the smell home so be careful of what you wear and what you bring in! Make sure they're all easily washable :D   And a tip...if you're using your hands to eat, make sure to ask the waitress for some limes/lemons. After you finish eating, wipe your hands with the paper towels to get rid of ALL sauces on your hands. Then you wash and rub your hands with the lime/lemon. Do it thoroughly. It should take off a good deal of the smell away from your hands. Then you just wipe your hands again to get rid of the lemony goodness and wash your hands the regular way! :D  And now I'm craving some Hot n Juicy after writing this review!",

HOLY SHIT...the sauce is insanely delicious. I'm a sauce kind of guy, and man this stuff is legit. ***note to self: figure out copy cat recipe of the Hot N Juicy special seasoning.   Make sure to go all out when eating these little jewels. Suck on your fingers, fuck wearing gloves, don't be afraid to suck the juices in the head, and crack it open afterwards to get some of that \"head fat\"...mmm. Just thinking about it gets me feening.  Don't wear anything nice cause the juice is no joke. Your fingers will smell all day. Their men's restroom even reeks of it. LOL.

The wait to be seated might take a good 45 mins on a dinner weekend but on the upside, food is delivered promptly. Mmmm you can see me grasping for my crab cracker as the bags are brought over. I'm ready for this peeling party.  Atmosphere is bangin too. Servers are alright. When it's busy we're kinda left on our own which is fine, but we need drink refills stat. Where you at?

    "text": "Ambiance: 3. Don't set the bar too high -- H 'n J is a dive restaurant just off the Las Vegas strip in Chinatown.  That said, the exposed brick, checked table clothes and local feel makes it a treat.  Cost: 5. For once, we can all beat Vegas.  Even with a sub-$10 cab fare from the strip, H 'n J is still very affordable for what you get.  A pound each of crawfish, shrimp, and kind crab with sides and drinks did not top $60 with tip.  Meal would cost at least 2x that at the casinos, I almost don't want to share the secret for fear they jack the prices.  Food Quality: 4. H 'n J serves its seafood in plastic bags they've mixed the seasonings in.  No plates, no rules -- it gets messy.  But it's so good, you don't care.  It was my first shelled crawfish experience -- quite tender, but a lot of work to open up their apparently smaller than average crawfishes.  Shrimp were good, king crab legs were AWESOME.  Lemon pepper and Hot 'n Juicy special seasoning were probably the two best choices to go with -- for heat lovers, go with at least medium spice for flavors.  Service: 5. Waitress great, she walked us through the crawfish de-shelling process on arrival, as well as several menu questions on what to order, how much of it, and seasoning flavors.  When to return: When you need to get off the Strip and the f out of dodge, a cheap but great seafood meal, when you're not looking to get lucky in the following 6 hours.",

    "text": "I always visit this place when I'm in Vegas! It absolutely delicious here. Way better than boiling crab in California--San Jose, Sacramento, Alhambra, Orange County--and just as yummy as the Seafood Shack in Anaheim. The prices are relatively same as in Cali: $9.99/lb of shrimp. $10.99/lb of crawfish. $8.99/half a dozen of oysters. $24.99/lb of king crab legs. (They were out of dungess crab, which was disappointing). The sauce options were more than most places I've been to: Louisiana style, Cajun style, butter garlic, lemon pepper, and hot n juicy special.   This time I took my family here for dinner during our Christmas vacation in Vegas.  When our party of 5 arrived we were told the wait would be 25 minutes, but after 10 minutes we were seated. Our server was Mathew. He was completely awesome: Super nice, friendly, funny, and attentive. The oysters were so sweet! My father, hubby, and I gulped them down as soon as they came out--Matt dropped by to make sure we'd already gotten our oysters and was surprised we'd already finished them all. It was that good. We ordered the soft shell basket (fried soft shell crab on cajun fries) and everyone love that. Although, for $10.95 we should've gotten more than 6 pieces, it was mostly fries. The crawfish was juicy and succulent. However, most of them were on the small side. The king crab legs were huge and meaty. Near the end of dinner, my dad wanted another order of Cajun fries. Unfortunately, Matt forgot to put in our order right away that we didn't get it 'til after we paid for our dinner. Matt was totally responsible and owned up to his mistake. We got our fries @ a discount: FREE. :)   To conclude: the experience, the food, & the service was really good.",

It's one of those places, \" O i always hate___ now i'm a fan!\"   You buy the crawfish by the pound, and it comes to your table all steamed and evenly garliced.  This is the part where i think non seafood people will never understand.  You rip the lil heads apart from the body and give their brains a good little sucking.  It's absoutely delicious :)  Dont act like a bad ass and feel like you can take the heat, because their HOT is HOT.  No shame in ordering the mild, as it does have  a little bit of kick.

From the street you'd think it was a small place with a huge rush, but come in and it is vast!  Coming in right at noon meant no wait time for us and the waitresses was friendly and helpful with her focus on us.  So much so that when my bib fell off she put a new one on me (yes it was as ridiculous as it sounds, better work on my knots. -_-).  For this time I ordered the shrimp since I heard the crawfish was a bit of work and yes I'm lazy.  I ordered a pound of it with the Hot N'Juicy sauce, one piece of corn, and some sweet potato fries.  I'm definitely not one for getting my hands messy, but I managed to get over it enough because the shrimp was delicious.  Sucking up all that sauce was the highlight, especially on the corn.  It's definitely a once in a while thing for me eating like that but I'll be remiss if I don't at least try the crawfish once in the future.",

Not a pretty place, just a hole in the wall with alot of tables squished inside. AWESOME catfish. Best I've eaten, doesn't manage to taste like dirty dishwater. The crawfish is worth the try, even if you think you don't like it. Try a pound (~$12). If ordered when they are in peak season, they are huge and succulent. If you are hesitant, order the shrimp (but alas, they are also head-on.)  Great spot to take visitors, but be careful. During peak mealtimes the wait is horrendous. Take-out is a good option. It's still hot by the time you get it home anywhere in the valley.   The service is usually pretty good, but always so busy. It would be nice if they expanded somehow. An outdoor eating area would be great or at least a sitting area. There is no indoor standing area, or paging system. Most people stand outfront in large groups or have to wait in the car. Also parking is a big pain in the *ss, so be sure you aren't running late for your date, it may take you a bit time to find a spot on a different local street.",

My friends told me Hot N Juicy took over the old Cajun Crawfish but made a few improvements to the space and decor. We were even more surprised by how good looking all the servers are. (We learned later on that a new reality show is going to start filming there so I assumed that's why they hired some hot-for-TV servers).  We went around 7 pm on a Friday night and it was pretty full but our group of 5 people and a baby were seated promptly. (A huge advantage over the original location.) We were tended to by a few different waitresses who were all very nice and tired a bib around each of our necks.   I ordered fried calamari for appetizer and a lb. of snow crab legs with garlic and butter sauce, medium level of spiciness. On that day, market price for snow crab legs was $16.99.  I had wanted Dungeness crab but they were all out. I got a side of rice and requested for lime and salt and pepper on the side. Everything was so flavorful and delicious! The medium heat was a little too hot for me and my lips were on fire but I still enjoyed every bite of my meal.",

    "text": "this is my favorite location for hot n juicy!! we really wanted a booth so we put our name down and waited about 45 minutes. they are supposed to send a text so that you could view your place in line. however, i didn't receive the text this time so i had to call them to check although we were about 5 minutes late, they reserved the booth for us when we were on our way. the waitress was so sweet. to dine in, it might take a bit of time (to get seated, order the food, and wait for the food). we ordered the garlic butter shrimp, crawfish, and sweet potato fries. for someone like me who can't handle a lot of spice, i would recommend the baby spice option. the sweet potato fries took longer to come out than usual. the overall wait for the food was about 10-15 minutes which is expected. our waiter Eric checked up on us a lot and the service was really great!! this place is my go-to :)",

My kids enjoyed the snow crab legs, dungeness crab and clams. Tried different seasonings-garlic butter, louisiana and cajun. All were good some were spicy but my kids can handle it. You can ask for mild. Service was okay. Wished they would have filled our water more often we needed it with the spice.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places! My boyfriend and I come here at least twice a month. And, we are never disappointed. We always order the following:   1) Corn Fritters: Deep fried creamy corn nuggets with ranch sauce. We literally crave this for days after we leave.   2)  Snow Crab: We get three different sauces. I recommend the Hot-N-Juicy sauce because it's a blend with all of the other sauces. Definitely has a great flavor to it.   3) Sausage and Corn: We throw these into the bag with the Hot-N-Juicy sauce. I've been told by those that don't like spicy that the sausage is spicy. However, I love spicy, so I think it's relatively mild.   We also order beer and sides like rice and extra butter, but those are the main things.   We ordered the crawfish and shrimp once, but I am not sure if the work is worth it. I'd much rather put the effort into crab.   Just be aware, you'll reek of garlic and be prepared to get messy! I always go no-gloves because it's just easier to get all the meat out of the shells that way.   It's always busy in here. I wish they stayed open later. They also have TVs all around, so it is great for watching the games.   The service is usually good. There have been a few times it has been sub-par, but that might be because there isn't just one dedicated server to each table. They're all helping every table.  Oh, the only thing I would say is... don't order the oysters. They aren't very good. I love oysters, but these didn't taste fresh at all. There was also very little meat to them. I usually eat a dozen oysters by myself, but I didn't want to even finish my half-dozen. Oh, and maybe also avoid the desserts. We had a brownie thing once and it wasn't good. Walk next door to the gelato place instead!  Go with the snow crab. You won't be disappointed.  Love this place. Favorite Cajun crab joint in town (and I've tried all of them)!",

Everything tasted amazing! Their sauce was just the right amount of Cajun, garlic, sweetness, and spice. And it compliments soooo well with rice!   Cajun calamari was fresh and perfectly crisp and a hint of Cajun. I sprinkle lemon on top and always ask for a side of tartar. That's how I like it!   Gloves, bibs, lemons, salt & pepper, & great service from Jared were also included. This was my father's first time here & he wished there were a Hot n Juicy where he's from. If he wasn't traveling back home today, he would've packed the sauce. Most def be back!",

They take forever to bring something as simple as extra pepper, spoons etc  we have to tell her 3/4 times & she stills gets annoyed. If were lucky they just check on us once most of the time none, they think theire all that it annoys me leaving a $20ish tip for a meal of two when we didnt have no service.  Please hire more guys!

We sat near the entrance so the service wasn't that great since the wait staff was mainly focusing on the big room in the back.  It took forever to get my iced tea refilled so I ended up going up to the waitress in the back room asking for a refill.    Otherwise food was good, we ordered the following:  1 lb of shrimp - Shrimp was a good size, they \"snapped\" when I bite into them so they were fresh.    1 lb of crawfish - Smallest crawfish I've ever had but they still had good flavor.  2 corns - frozen corn because it was soggy to the bite.  Fried catfish with seasoned fries - regret getting this, the meat on the catfish was very soft so maybe that is the texture of catfish.  Definitely not my favorite.   I will definitely go back and just order the shrimp and crawfish.",

We love this place so much that one time, we came here 6x over a 3 day trip. In fact, our first visit included us polishing off 10lbs of seafood. Some may call that disgusting. We viewed that as an accomplishment.  What to order: Shrimp is always (as the name suggests) hot n juicy. You must order this! Crawfish is a novelty which you'll definitely order the first time, but likely eventually realize that it's a lot of work for a wee bit of meat. Lobster is excellent but the sauce doesn't penetrate. Mussels are good if you like mussels. Green are juicier and plumper than black. Snow crab is good but my recommendation would be to order it on its own so it doesn't get cold. King crab is amazing and you'll need at least 1 lb between 2 people. 3 people? Get 2 lbs.  Btw: Eric, who was our server the last time we were there is AMAZING. He deserves a promotion. We wish our entire (generous ) tip could have gone to him!!!",

    "text": "I'm not sure if it's the location or what the case was but it's very disappointing because the food is great but the service doesn't do it any justice. I think from the moment we sat down we had about 6 different servers the person who took our drink order didn't even drop off the drink a separate person took our food order. Once our food dropped I was assuming they'd just offer if anyone needed salt or pepper, lemons since it's so common to use those condiments with the shrimp or any of their seafood really. Not only did I have to get up and ask the host to ask my server for these things because I was unaware of who they were it took about 15 minutes to have someone come over to again ask what it was we needed. At this point now we need refills. My bag of shrimp is now cold. Mind you these are all simple things that could be avoided if the server would have checked to see how our meal was we could've asked for these things while my food was still hot. By the time we were finished we're sitting there waiting for someone to bring us a check or finally ask for how things are going and no one came around I had to ask the busser for our check because everyone else refused to make eye contact as they walked past. Now another 10 minutes later the check is dropped and no one picks it up. Back to the issue of not knowing who the server is I have no choice but to get up and take it to the registers. Once at the registers I see the manager Nikki. I explain to her what happened and she's not paying to much attention as she's counting a register and looks at the receipt apologizes and tells me that it's because they have a shift change at 5. Okay understandable, except my receipt read 5:45 and it's now close to 8 so I know the first round of drinks wasn't rang in until 45 minutes after this shift change so that's nothing but an excuse. Look. I wasn't expecting anything to be taken off of the check that wasn't what I asked for maybe just caring for the customers concerns a little more, working in the service industry I know that people get busy and I understand that but it's complete chaos. I'm not too sure how it works if people are dedicated to sections or not but honestly just make the drive about two blocks away and go to boiling crab. The service is way better and you'll have one server.",

Service: 5 - The service was fast and responsive, and our server was super funny! There was absolutely nothing to complain about. It was pretty much excellent!  Food: 4 - I like and crave seafood all the time, so this is one of my go-to places for that. They give you gloves and bibs, which are a little bit pointless, because you end up smelling like sauce and garlic over your entire self, no matter what you do!!   Like a regular 'seafood and sauce' place, everything is styled so you can pick your food and basically make it how you want it. Because I'm a poor college student, I always get shrimp in the Hot N Juicy in medium or mild! And if you're Asian, like me, you know you're spending on that bowl of rice! Unless you're on some diet that day. But let's face it, you're at Hot N Juicy, you came to eat!!   Sometimes, when I save up money, I'm able to upgrade myself to crab legs and raw oysters..you know, on special occasions and such :)   If you like a lot of meat, I would suggest crab or shrimp, since they really have the most worthwhile amounts of that. The crawfish are actually really small here, and I'm not a fan of the taste, anyway.   It is a great place to go when you're hungry! Just scrub, scrub, scrub when you're at home, because the smell will take a bit of work to get rid of!!",

    "text": "Being from the South I am a HUGE fan of anything Cajun related. Crawfish fall firmly under this heading ergo...  Went in on a Saturday night and the place was half full, but filling up fast. Got a great table with enough room so we could peel some crawfish and drink some beer. The place is clean and nice and has a family feel to it, namely because of the large tables for groups.   Sat down and immediately ordered crawfish, oysters, mussels and dungeness crab. We also ordered some beer. Their selection is small and disappointing, but if you like domestics and Sapporo you should be okay.   Very quickly out come bags of crawfish. They were tiny, but that was sort of okay because I knew that they were out of season. Still you're really paying for a lot of body and very little meat this time of year.  I ordered mine very spicy, you can choose how you want them seasoned. I wanted them to burn, which they did. The friend I was with got his mild and they were okay. I'm a huge fan of hot, so. We also got the mussels which were my very, very favorite. I could have just eaten them. They had this nice, garlic-y sauce and were tender and tasty! The oysters weren't tops shelf, I probably would never get them from here again, but put a little cocktail sauce on them and they're edible. Also ordered the dungeness crab. WASTE. DO NOT BUY. It was probably the worst waste of $30 I've ever spent and just thinking about it upsets me. You get a huge crab with big legs and you crack it open and the meat is mealy. You don't pull it out in big, chunky pieces, it actually can be gotten out with a spoon. If the company I had been with wasn't so awesome I would have pitched a FIT. Gross.  The service here is pretty sporadic. One minute they're fawning over you, next twenty minutes you're asking where the beer is you've asked for five times.   I probably won't ever go back here, but it was nice to see what the (over) hype was about.  Edited to add: If you're expecting Louisiana crawfish you will be disappointed, this tastes nothing like it. It's their own made up something that is decent, but NOT cajun. Also, they give you gloves if you don't want  your hands to smell fishy for three days - that was a nice touch.",

They plopped down a bag for each of us that contained a huge portion of crawdads, shrimp, corn cobs, potato chucks and sausage bits all in a pick your own level of spiciness creole sauce.   We opted not to use provided plastic gloves and just dived right in.  Glad we did because licking your fingers of the delicious sauce is part of the fun in my humble opinion.

She left got our table ready and another server came up to help and sat the wrong people without asking us if we were first.  I complained and they said it will be a couple minutes! Looks like the servers and hostess have a lack of communication!! As for the food Love the lemon pepper seasoning is great. The Seafood came out early but the rest of our order didn't come out til we were just about done eating! Sweet Potato Fries are the best. I usually recommend this place but for this day the service was dissappointing.",

We decided to try this place as our grand daughter was turning 7 and requested crab for her birthday dinner.  We didn't know what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised.  The place was squeaky clean.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  The food? Amazing.  The birthday girl had a pound of crab legs and asked for more.  We each ate the pound of crab legs plus a pound of shrimp.  The sauces and seasonings were delicious.  The corn fritters were great.  Hubby, who is not a big seafood fan, will eat fried shrimp and these were great.  Our one regret was having show tickets and having to leave the restaurant when what we all really wanted to do was order another round of crab for everyone.  This is the new must-do when our son's family comes out to visit.",

The waitress comes over (Asian chic) asking what we wanna order, speaking so fast (like an auctioneer). Clearly she's in a hurry. we order our food and it comes out fairly quickly. Shrimp... then crab.... some fried catfish.... then a sudden halt. Where's the crawfish? Asked a waitress to check on it after waiting at least 15 minutes. She said \"they're working on it, it should be right out.\" 10 minutes later, still nothing. Ask another server - \"it's on the ticket so it should be on the way.\" ANOTHER 15 minutes and at this point we don't even want it anymore. I mean seriously, it took us less time to wait to order and eat everything, and still no crawfish. We ask if we can cancel the order since it's taken WAY too long. Great no problem... then the bill comes and they still charge for the crawfish! Ayuh! Wave one down again and they take it off - no apology... nothing.  As far as the taste - it's not all that. If ya'll are from So. Cal, don't waste your time here. Go to Boiling Crab in L.A.  Save your time and money for the craps table - at least you'll have a fighting chance. This was a lose/lose situation.  Hot n Juicy Crawfish? I wouldn't know... it never came!",

    "text": "The flavor is still ridiculously good, the atmosphere is better with the high ceiling and well lit space, but the crawfish are not worth the money. The ones during this visit hardly had any meat. The real deal are the shrimp. These big, plump, and juicy crustaceans steal the show.  At Hot N Juicy, start by picking a protein, followed by seasoning, then the spice factor and finish it off with extras that they will cook in all the juices. For four, we easily dined on one pound of Hot N Juicy Special Spicy Crawfish with two pieces of corn and potatoes, two pounds of HNJ Special Extra Spicy Shrimp with two pieces of corn, two potatoes and half a dozen pieces of sausage, and a basket of ten fried shrimp ($10.99). Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon. For a quarter more, I am down with getting the import beers.   The service was decent tonight. Our server was quick to refill our water cups. Even one that wasn't ours refilled our cups. Our server did look disappointed that our order was so small, but it was more than enough for us. At a little over $60, the bill is not a cheap meal. I am still more fond of the original location, but this one is rather attractive.",

Got some blue moons for $3 each, which is a pretty good price if you ask me. I came with 8 other people so we ordered a whole lot of shrimps and crawfishes. Got 2 lbs of the hotnjuicy special crawfish and 2 lbs of garlic butter shrimp, 2 lbs of lemon pepper shrimp, 1 lb of louisiana style shrimp, 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 order of cajun fries, and some rice. The bibs and gloves they provide are very handy, and you should change your gloves once or twice during your eating period because the sauces definitely leak through and you'll be stuck smelling like cajun for a few hours or days after. The crawfish were a bit of a struggle for me to break into, but the sauce did it for me, so good and with a kick (my lips were for sure burning way after finishing eating). We started taking shots of balls of rice with the different sauces on top, DELISH! The shrimps had a significant amount more meat than the crawfish an were easier to peel. The cajun fries order got lost somewhere during the meal, but they were pretty nice about getting the order to us as fast as possible.   This place is definitely worth trying and won't break the bank!",

I arrived a little before dinner time and the place wasn't packed. Ok. I got it, it's because no one has come for dinner yet. So, I'm happy about not having to wait but Not so happy about the service and their crawfish that day. The service was slow and unfriendly and the crawfish was not fresh at all. It was small and very chewy. I know crawfish is not in season in February when i went but I thought they serve up fresh live crawfish year round. I didn't expect it to be less great (being the first one opening) than their place in Washington D.C where it never disappoint. Every chance I visit D.C, I always stop by to order or eat in. The flavor of their sauces there seems tastier, more flavorful, and crawfish fresher. If anyone has a chance to visit D.C and loves crawfish as much as I do, then stop by the Hot n Juicy there!",

The lemon butter sauce is in my opinion the best for the crab and the hot n juicy special sauce is better for the shrimp and crawfish.   Keep in mind crawfish don't have a large amount of meat on them so these are best for an appetizer.   Service has always been good.",

I knew that it would be tough to get a table but I finally gave in and thank God I did.  We stopped by the other location first, looked like an hour wait at 6PM, crazy.  Drove a mile down the street and got the last table at this location which was lucky because after us there was a 20-30 minute wait.  Ordered some shrimp ($10/lb) and dungeness crab ($15/lb).  The shrimp was awesome, serious flavor...make sure you dip them back in the sauce after you shuck them.  A single dungeness crab was $20 and not worth it.  I'll stick to the shrimp next time.  You will definitely want to wear the bib and also some eye protection.  I shot hot 'n juicy sauce in my eye, that sucked.  The food is great and I will definitely be coming back...",

Our server was extremely patient since it took us a while to decide what we want to eat.  A pile of dirty plastic gloves and bibs later, my friend and I were still chatting away but we didn't feel like we were being rushed to get out already when our server said, \"lemme clean the table so you can continue talking without getting anything dirty\".   They're taking pictures of diners now to post on Instagram.  Then the BFF decided to embarass me to death by having a male server come to our table and ask him odd questions!  He was very nice though and wasn't ticked off or anything like that.  That is one True test of the great service here!",

We were told that the blue crab is available and that the person on the phone said that she is very sure that they do have blue crab. When we got to the place and finally sat down to order we were told that it hasn't been available. This really freaking piss me off. The parking is a hassle and we don't appreciate being lied to.

OMG, I can't believe its been soooo long since I have eaten oysters!! VERY GOOD!!! Our order arrived, really tasty and I really didn't mind peeling the shrimp.

Server was really sweet.  Didn't take us long to get our food either. We ordered the crawfish extra spicy ( $11.99 lb )  Snow crab ( market price lb )  Lobster ( market price per lb )  Fried shrimp w/ fries ( $11? )  Oysters ( I honestly forgot the price ) Everything was honestly so flavorful. The fried shrimp had the batter that Georgians would use for their fish, which was really different but honestly so crunchy and delicious. The fries, omg I loved their fries. Nothing special about it, I just love fries! The snow crabs were very wet, just the way we like it. We asked for a side of butter but I think the waitress got confused and added butter to our flavoring I believe. But we ended up not needing the butter anyways because I ended up dipping in the bag.  The lobster, omg the lobster had so much meat. It was soooo good! Nothing compared to GA's seafood restaurants AT ALL. The oysters were very fresh and a pretty decent size. Pretty sure they were blue point oysters. Lastly, the crawfish. The flavor was there and all but for being live, it wasn't as big as a I hoped and it also kept breaking.  All and all I give this place a 4 stars for their amazing food!",

I have heard alot of things about this place because I am from California, so I've tried boiling crab, kickin crab, crawdaddy, and alot of crawfish joint's in San Jose.. and this place does live it up to it's expectations.  I would say the atmosphere is very similar to to all the crawfish joint's. Shoutout to the guy who spilled a little water on my iPhone and was nice enough to apologize and give me an extra 15% off my bill. There sauce has a little bit of spice, I would reocmmend to try there Hot N Juicy Special with Medium spice. It's very good.. friendly customer service, the place is average big..  I would definitely come back again if i'm ever in vegas and craving some crawfish cause i can easily eat it in san jose!",

I've gone to many places and their extra spicy is not spicy at all. I also love the bits of garlic in the sauce. Cajun fries are bomb! So is the calamari.  And if you're feeling a bit adventurous and like lemon pepper flavor, ask for lemons and black pepper salt. Squeeze a couple lemons into the sauce cup with the salt and pepper mixture. Mix the hot n juicy sauce with the lemon in your rice. So delicious! Haha. Also make sure to ask for gloves if you don't want to have your hands smelling or if you have cuts on your hands.

We ordered one lb of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp with different sauce each, corn cob, 1/2 lb sausages and plain rice. I had the crab in hot and spicy sauce, it was delicious! The shrimp in mild sauce had great flavor as well. Overall, the food is phenomenal, service is awesome, and the atmosphere is just happy and bursting with happy people enjoying their food.

After 20 mins like he says, I have my bf go pick up the food. And when his there,he was told the order is canceled! The food was NEVER made! and the kitchen just closed! They says they called me back but I told them the wrong number!?!?  WTF?! Seriously? The guy work there repeated my number wrong and I correct him,apprently and he still wrote it wrong!Is that my fault that the guy was so stpuid to write a correct phone number and so irresponsible about the order?and Why would you call back to confirm the order all of sudden why you guys never done that before??And not telling the customers you would have a confrim call at the first place?!   I order the food,wait the time,take a taxi get there,didnt get anything and was fucking staving. The ppl work there all they say is \"NOTHING we can do\" RUDELY!I understand this place is busy. The customer service and some employees are just unfriendly and not responsiable!VERY DISAPPOINTING!",

My last experience, I had to send my crab legs back because they put about 10 of the smallest legs in the bag vs giving me legs with actual meat in them. Took forever to get a response from manager about cooking me more and then once cleared (10-15 minutes later) they said it would be an additional 20 mins to cook. Told them to just take it off my tab....",

When I received my order I was excited because everything looked yummy. However, when I bit into a potato it was black and fermented looking in the middle. On top of that, 1 lb side of crab legs were hardly a pound and were brown and not orange in color as they should've been. Wait, not done! The shrimp! Smh were extremely mushy and uncleaned. I left disgusted and highly irritated for wasting $60! Save your coins people. Not worth it...",

They were pretty packed, but we only waited maybe 10 minutes for a table...not bad at all.  We ordered crab legs, shrimp, andouille sausage, and corn with the medium sauce. The food was so good and their sauces are still delish! The food is delivered hot, which is always a plus. The downfall with Hot N Juicy opposed to other seafood boil places is they do not give you all the food in one bag. The shrimp came out first, then like 5-10 minutes later the crab legs, sausage, and corn came out. A lot of people, like myself, like to have everything together. It's a minor thing, but it does drive me a little nuts. Lol. One other thing I didn't like is they make you order 6 or 12 sausage pieces, while other places allow you to order however many you'd like.   Overall, the food and service were good. I'd go back to this location whenever I return to Vegas.",

We also bring people who hasn't had a proper shrimp and crawfish boil here. Order a pound at a time. They'll just tally it up by the time you're done.  Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. The only protective covering your should wear is the bib. Remember, you don't wear your food, you eat it. Get the spicy sauce too,, trust me, you can handle this one.  Never have I had a bad experience coming here or to their other branch. I love the food and the service. Will definitely keep returning and bringing new people in.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!",

I didn't think it was that hot then after about 30 seconds I drank two glasses of water Hahahaha omg I was even going to tell my server he must have gotten us medium lol but oh no I definitely had met my match. I am a spicy girl everything I get is hot or spicy so that level of intense was great!!!! I ordered a pound of crab legs, a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, and potatoes and corn. Everything was absolutely delicious and the crab legs were very fulfilling I definitely feel like I got my monies worth. I can't wait to return when I am back in Vegas this will be on the list of places to visit on the first day and last. The customer service was fast and prompt. Our server was attentive and friendly. They have margaritas which was a big help for my fiery mouth hahaha. Thanks HOT N JUICY for the awesomeness!!!",

I recommend shrimp instead of crawfish because you get more bang for your buck and it is less work to get your meat.  I went with a big group of people about 14 and they accommodated us really well.   When you order your food it comes in a big plastic bag filled with the tastiest sauce and spices you could ever dream of.  You have to un shell your shrimp or whatever else you order which may seem like a lot of work but once you take your first bite of this godly food you won't care anymore because any ounce of work is always worth that next bite.  You get so much food so the price is worth it and you will not leave displeased.  I have never been to Louisiana but I imagine this is how it must be down there or if anything this might be better!  Give it a try and you'll definitely want to come back!",

If you plan on coming with a large group make sure everyone is present or they will give your table away... Seems fair. Fast forward to the food I ordered a 1 pound of snow crab legs and my friend ordered 1 pound of shrimp and we both shared the Cajun fries.  The fries were great with a nice kick to it. We ordered or seafood with the hot n juicy sauce (all 3 flavors) it was awesome! Tried a few other places and this probably would be up there with the top 3, EXCEPT the service! It was awful.  I honestly don't even know who our waiter was. I asked for something to crack open the legs, I didn't receive it until I had two legs left and no energy to attempt the remaining ones. We had to repeat ourselves several times to multiple waiters just to get something. It was very frustrating. If the service were better I would probably go back but I may try a different location.   Just be aware great food, crap service.",

I'm a spoiled man who has all the dirty work done for him before the shrimp comes out but here, I was forced into a corner to eat here and on top of that, they ordered for me. Really wasn't into heads and legs on shrimp before I walked in the door but let me tell you that my opinion had soon changed. The food was amazing, spicy, and hands on. The shrimp bag and sausage was THEE best combo I've had in a while. Had some fried shrimp also and it was good. Wonderful waitresses although I couldn't keep my eyes off of one in perticular, and this waitress made me try crawfish which wasn't bad either. Great experience. Great environment. Great food. Great time. Will always eat here in Vegas especially if I catch this waitress working",

There were many uncleaned tables, and it took them 20m to finally clean one and another 15m after cleaning that one to seat us. The server came to take our order right away but we didn't see her again until after we had to STAND UP, WALK TO THE BAR AREA AND REQUESTED TO ORDER MORE AND HAVE OUR DRINKS REFILLED!!! I mean really? That meant she didn't check on us at all for a good 45m, after we finished our cajun fries and 5lbs of crawfish!!! What did she do meanwhile you might ask? She was CLEANING TABLES! Like come on!!! When we needed the tables to be clean, you didnt clean it. She decided to clean tables when there were literally only 2 people waiting. Ugh!!!! If it wasnt for the great flavors of food, this would have been a 1 star review!! Im a server myself so I found this experience to be very frustrating!!!",

I'm down-grading to 4 because the spices didn't seem to be as on-point and we had to wait a very long time for shrimp 'cause they gave our order to the wrong table. We did get our crawfish and soft shell crab quickly though.  Minor complaints, but I'm pretty selective with my 5 stars.",

I am a huge fan of eating with my hands and I do love myself a \"different\" eating experience, so I am a little sad to be giving this location its rating. It had been my first time dining at this location and the other, I was very fond of. The food had noticeably less flavor, sweet potato fries were a little burnt, our server misheard an order or two of ours, but they handled it fairly well and my party was grateful for that. I really do prefer the other location, but the food is good and it's a great place to go to with friends.",

The hostess took out named down and told us we might have a 25 minute wait. We hung out by the old school barber shop next door. In about 15 mind the hostess called our names and we were ushered to our table. We had the corn fritters, pound of lemon garlic shrimp, pound of hot'n'juicy crawfish, a pound of Louisiana mussels and a pound of snow crab legs. The corn fritters were fresh, juicy and just melted in your mouth. The shrimp was succulent and simply out of the world. The crawfish had a good flavor but they were not the best I've had. The waitress told us that they were out if fresh crawfish and only had them frozen and we got half price. The snow crab was meaty and was slightly on the saltier side.  For the portions and the price, this place is well worth it. There is a gelato bar 2 doors down and if you feel the burn, have the watermelon gelato.",

But good food sometimes leads to that. Service was excellent and CUTE ASS waitresses. As one said to me... \"where the waitresses are HOT N the Crawfish are JUICY\" So True!!! Thanks Miranda!! The best kinda place for me. Definitely make this a spot to try. I will be back again for sure. All food was great and flavorful. Service was top notch. Topped everything off with some complmentary fried brownies for desert. Wow!!! It is True that if you deep fry anything it's better. Delicious!! Keep up the great work Miranda and all the staff.",

Does it really get any better than that??  I have tried the garlic butter and the lemon pepper seasonings. Garlic butter is BOMB!!! Lemon pepper is delish just a little more on the salty side that is even too much for a salt lover like myself.  Also for hotness level mild is freakin hot. I dont like spicey foods so I thought mild would be ok.. NO.. no its not.. its like fire. So anything more is a risk you've got to be willing to take. Baby spice is pretty much no spice with is just fine with me. Go try everything twice then go again!",

    "text": "My favorite low country boil style seafood place! Service is wonderful, can be slow when it gets busy but it's to be expected.  They really have a bit of an edge over other similar places; gloves, extras (corn,potato, sausage) included when you get 2lbs of crawfish. Be cautious when ordering your spice level, sometimes even the mild can be hotter than you'd expect, but always get the hot n juicy!  Only place that has compared to this place is chasin tails back in VA, but they are missing the rice :P",

She was very attentive and also very helpful with the menu. She def suggested some great combinations and which sauces to try! Go with the HNJ special or LP! The ambience was a tad bit smaller I believe than the other locations but it wasn't too busy so didn't have to wait which is always a plus. I will be coming back soon!",

    "text": "I am a hot & juicy fan.. Even before it was on the travel channel and became so widely popular. I have preached the wonders of shrimp and crawfish to all my friends and will even choose H&J over The BoilingCrab. I have had many wonderful dinners at the original location and the servers are always so attentive. So why the low rating for this new location you ask? Its not the food that lacks at this location, it's the service.   We tried out this place on a Thursday night around 9:00.. It wasn't too busy so when we arrived the hostess sat us right after she cleared up a booth. After a while a not so enthusiastic nor friendly server took our drink order. Then when she came back we ordered 2 lbs of shrimp + potatoes, rice, rolls and sweet potato fries.   Slowly our order started to arrive one by one delivered by a food runner.. Soon we received everything except the sweet potato fries. Over half way through our dinner still no fries.. And no sign of our server.. So we have to flag someone down & ask and we find out that they ran out of SP fries a while a go and our server was supposed to tell us.. Then we are told not to worry it will immediately be taken off our check..  At this point our server has yet to once check up on us.. I spot her bottle blonde pig tails numerous times chit chatting with her co workers and horsing around..   Then we have to flag someone down again to place a Togo order but then we're told the kitchen is closed...    Finally our server shows up only to plop a checkbook down on the table.. Peeved, we want to leave so we give her our card., when it comes back we realize they didn't take off the fries after all.. So we go to the front and the girl apologizes and says she needs to swipe the card again but we should be rest assured it will only be charged once because they settle all the transactions at the end of the night. So there goes another 5 minutes of waiting around due to bad service all the while food is still being brought out to tables.. \"kitchen closed\" my a$$..   ..The next day sure enough the card got charged twice from hot and juicy.   Now I'm sorry, I honestly don't mean to be rude and I am a pretty patient person but seriously how hard is it to be a server at a restaurant that only has plastic silverware, paper towels and serves their food from a plastic bag.. ? Had the server just done her job adequately my experience would have been great.",

    "text": "We were really craving some crawfish so decided to try this place out. The food was good. Very pricey compared to what I'm used to back home. The crawfish were kind of small in my opinion for the middle of the season. They also charge for getting extra crawfish sauce to dip in so be wary. We got the corn, sausages, black mussels, crawfish and shrimp in the hot n juicy flavor. The flavoring was decent, not bad but for the price and size I would think twice the next time. The sausage pieces they give you are tiny I would've thought they would come out as bigger pieces, but they're pretty thin and not worth it. The crawfish can be small, the mussels were the least satisfying, but the shrimp were the best here. The shrimp were good sizes and were very sweet tasting and flavor-some. Will probably try a different place before going here again.",

But about a month ago the quality really degraded, the Crawfish was extremely dirty but still tasted ok. Today we went again. To start the Crawfish was dirty again which eh whatever. The Crawfish this time tasted very off like it had gone bad or was frozen for a long time. We let the server know and he checked and returned saying it wasn't Frozen and it was fresh. After we finished what we could of the food we ordered (had the pound of shrimp and fries we ordered but did not touch the Crawfish after the second one still tasted off.  At the end the manager came over and this is the conversation that took place... M= manager me=me M \"I understand you had confusion about the Crawfish\" me \"No confution it tasted off like it had gone bad\" M making excuses \"Well we check that they are alive every day, rotating them, and power wash them, how much did you have?\" me \"only two, but when both tasted off and we where assured that they were fresh we didn't have any more because we didn't want to get ill from sick seafood\"   Did the manager do anything besides make excuses, did she at least reduce the price of the inedible food? No we paid the full price nearly$50 when half the food was inedible and could have made us very sick. Poor management, and honestly I feel bad for the servers who will get screwed out of tips due to most people tip not just on service but also food quality and it wasn't the servers fault the manager probably changed distributers to save a penny.  We gave the server a full tip because he did everything he could to correct the issue, but if I hadn't worked in the food industry before and know how much it sucks to get stiffed on tips for something out of my control I would have put \"manager owes you $9 out of her pocket for your tip since she didn't discount the inedible food\"  Use to be a great place but last two times have been very disappointing. Definitely do NOT recommend the Crawfish with their current food supplier. But even so if this happens to you remember to still tip your server appropriately if it's not their fault.",

A good friend of mine raved on about Hot N Juicy so I finally gave it another shot and ever since then, I'm here at least every month. I did try Boiling Crab again a few months back and now I really taste the difference. Hot N Juicy is just so much more flavorful and I find myself craving it frequently.  I don't have a bad thing to say about service here. The waiters/waitresses are usually very nice and there isn't usually a long wait for the food. But if you come here for dinner it usually gets pretty busy and parking gets frustrating.  I usually order 1 lb of shrimp, Hot N Juicy mild or medium with a side of rice. The Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all of the sauces and is so freaking delicious. I like to pour a little bit of the sauce over my rice and squeeze a few lemons. I have tried some of their other menu items such as their crab legs, oysters and fried shrimp basket and all are delicious but I always just go straight for the 1lb of shrimp.  Always gonna come back here :)",

The wait was about 20-30 minutes and the place was packed. The only thing negative think I have to say is the catfish. It's like air fried maybe?? I won't get that again. I ordered crab legs, corn and potatoes for me and the kids. I also added a pound of sausage. My my ordered a lbs of shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes. All in all I will continue to return.",

On the 20th my fiance & I came here for lunch & prob won't be back to this location after. We ordered drinks first, when the waiter brought the drinks out we were ready to order. After we order they seat a couple next to us. Maybe like 10 mins later we got our andouille sausages. About a few mins after that the table next to us got their Po Boy (we ordered 2 Po Boys). We continued to wait but as the waitresses are coming out everyone else was getting their food besides us. I then went up the the counter to speak with the guy who took my order I asked him what's taking so long & why is everyone getting their food before us. He proceeded to tell me that all the orders were put in at the same time & he can't control what the kitchen puts out first. I told him that's not right cause we clearly came in & placed our order before the people who got served before us. & how is that possible for their food to come out before ours if they weren't here to place the order. He said the same thing & just left it at that. We ordered a dozen sausages, 2 Po boys & a shrimp basket. We got the Po boys & shrimp basket about 30-40 mins after we placed our order. When the woman waitress finally brought our food out the sticker on it said it was ordered at 12:26pm we got out food at 1pm. The lady apologized for the wait & refunded us $4.81. The guy never apologized or took accountability. So we won't be back to this location. The strip location has better service & fresher food.",

Very inefficient service and customer service. Very disconnected team. Took forever to get food. Even ordered rice and had to ask 3 times. We finally got after hour at table. Asked for knife to cut corn for kids with braces. Asked 2 times after another 30 min finally got.  Then got done and asked for the bill and finally got fed up went to counter to get it. Credit card machine was down and they are writing my number down on a piece of paper... Unbelievable and never had such an experience at the other location.",

The restaurant was its usual busy 90% occupied with parking hard to find in this Valley View & Spring Mountain plaza. My friends ate the crawfish and they were ginormous!  The shrimp were also huge as I took an extra pound home. Hot n Juicy mild sauce was on point.   The catfish and calamari were okay but this is to be expected from battered deep fried seafood. I honestly believe these guys are about equal to Cajun Crawfish as well as Boiling Crab. The sauce at this location has a little more taste than the others but they are close to equal.",

Whenever anyone mentions seafood in a bag in the back of my head I'm rolling my eyes thinking \"Psh, this is gonna taste like shit compared to Boiling/Kickin Crab.\" Okay I was wrong. The seafood was fresh and the flavor of the Hot N Juicy sauce was fiiiire (bomb AND super spicy). I got spicy because I usually get spicy at boiling/kickin and it was a bit much so I recommend getting medium. The fries were definitely not the business.... And the corn was a bit soggy... BUT ONE THING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND and will def come back for: ettouffe. It isn't necessarily gumbo but it's similar to it just less soupy...  omg seriously so fucking delicious. DROOL.",

We were treating my husband's cousin to her birthday dinner. It was her pick, she's been before and enjoys it. She ordered a pound of snow crab (hot & spicy, mild) Dungeness crab is seasonal, supposedly it was in season, but they were out, so we got a pound of snow crab + corn (garlic butter, extra spicy) and crawfish (hot & juicy special, extra spicy).   It was my first time eating crawfish whole, I love the tails, but it's so not worth the work or price. $9.99/lb and not even 1/4lb was edible. The snow crab wasn't meaty at all. It made us long for San Francisco or NOLA for that matter. We also had cajun and sweet potato fries. I usually love sweet potato fries but these were limp and bland. We did like the cajun fries they were the spiciest thing we ate. Service was bad. It was a bad beat. $70 later, we were still hungry. Worse yet, our clothes stunk to high heavens afterwards, and the following day we could not get enough to drink. Holy sodium, Batman.",

I specially like the clams cause there is no pealing to do and you can use the shell to scoop all the juices...so yummy!!!  My favorite side items would be corn, rice and bread roll (French people and their carbs lol!!!)  I also appreciate the Fact that they use real tasty butter and not the hydrogenated crap...  The Cajun fries were not all that but I guess that's because my grandma spoiled me with those fried goodness back in the days!  Perfect place for a Bday party.  By the way the \"medium\" spicy is actually spicy compared to some \"crab shack\" and other restaurant chain but here this is the real deal!",

On my bill were 2 charges for EXTRA sauce, $3.50 total. I explained I didn't receive any additional sauce so remove the charge. This so-call manager said he would go speak to the server to find out first what took place. The manager came back and said he would not remove the charge because I got extra sauce. We went back n forth. I explained the waitress never said \" well if I have them separate the sauce there will be an extra charge.\" She even came over n explained the whole extra charge concept AFTER the fact BUT never said any this in the beginning or I would've said at that time the same thing I'm saying right now, \"that is stupid to do to your customers\" Long story short he would not remove this $3.50. It's the principle folks! I left the exact total amount of the bill, and my friend removed her tip that she had already had on the table. All of the servers were great!  The waitress lost a total of $16 in tip money between the 2 of us due to her brilliant manager over $3.50.",

Even tho its busy all the time trust me it's worth the wait and if a restaurant ain't busy then there's a red flag lol. Anyways if your in vegas definitely come out to hot n juicy there's more then one location and the food is exactly the same . The waitresses and hostess are so nice and friendly. I tried all the different sauce and all of it is great very flavorful.  Also like that they do 1/2 of shrimp.",

You are using your hands most of the time and the plastic bib can come of easily, so expect some splashed sauce on you clothing. I always go for their shrimp with Hot n Juicy sauce. The shrimps are fresh and huge. The sauce suites the the shrimp meat very well. I also love their seasoned fries.   The quality of the food and service is exactly same as the Henderson location, but this place is more busy sometimes. You should check it out.",

    "text": "\"I'll have the usual please! 1 lb of Shrimp, Hot & Juicy special, less than mild + corn on the cobb!\"   Honestly, the best thing ever.  I always ask for less than mild because their spice rating is a little above average and my taste buds can't handle it! I like to also eat my shrimp with a side of white rice. Delicious!  All seafood orders are served in a plastic bag.  You are given a bib to eat so it doesnt go on your cloths.   It WILL get a little messy, so make sure youre not wearing white... unless you're extra careful. Also be prepared to smell like garlic for a few days! So worth it though! -- I also love their chicken wings w/ sweet potato fries.  Fun atmosphere, great staff.  Theyre always attentive.  Only complaint i have is that when I ask for less than mild for my spice level, its always a hit or miss. Sometimes its spicer than other days.... so its never consistent. I've had to send my shrimp back on a few occasions.  Other than then when its perfect, its PERFECT!",

My favorite is hot and juicy style with medium spice. Go for baby spice if you don't like spicy. I would try the mussels also. They were really good but it does take longer to make and come out.

Lemon pepper shrimpies mild were large and very easy to peel. Green mussels were plentiful! The crawfish were a bit tiny but eh there were plenty of options at the table.

So we headed over to Starbucks to wake ourselves up and to kill some time before they opened at 11am.   We headed back and we were immediately seated.  We quickly looked over the menu and decided on our orders.  I always get a 1/2lb of shrimp, mild, with the 'Hot & Juicy' sauce.  Their sauce is a lot spicier than the crawfish joints in San Diego (Crab Hut).  I, personally, prefer Hot & Juicy over Crab Hut.  The sauce just tastes better!    I think next time I'll get the 'baby spice' level with my shrimp.  My lips were tingling after finishing my food, but I enjoyed every bite and it was worth it!  LOL  *** Tip:  Be sure to use the plastic bib they provide.  And if you don't want your hands smelling like your food, ask for gloves.  Also, if you wear contacts, I highly recommend wearing gloves and avoid removing/ touching your eyes after eating here.  You will feel a slight sting if you remove your contacts shortly after  (haha from personal experience).  And, finally, pre-cut some paper towels and fold them on your table so you can easily grab them when needed.  Enjoy!",

The shrimp is larger here and the sauce has more flavor (in my opinion.) The king crabs are also bigger and it was meatier here than BC. Oysters were fresh but they didn't have tobasco or any hot sauce, which was a bummer.. And the sweet potato fries were ON POINT! They're cooked perfectly!   The downside - don't bother ordering their any of their fried foods. We ordered calamari and the rings were TINY and overcooked, Cajun fries are regular French fries with Cajun seasoning sprinkled on top (nothing special), and the chicken wings were okay, didn't have much flavor to them.

    "text": "I came on a Tuesday night, and they were slammed. Took ten minutes to get a waitress's attention. They were out of quite a bit of their entres. You get stuff delivered in plastic bags, on a plastic table cloth, or in styrofoam soup cups. There isn't any silverware to speak of that I could see and fountain drinks come the same way. The prices are so-so. I had their etouffe. There's only one, and it's mudbug etouffe over rice. It was reasonably flavored, but over-seasoned with cracked pepper even for a Gulf Coaster. There is lobster, three kinds of crab (two missing, the least inexpensive) and an assortment of sides, like corn, sweet potato fries, and so forth. My limited sampling said that it's over-rated.   Two other clues. The parking lot is tiny and insufficient for a large patronage; parking up the side street if you dare. The waitresses don't really understand their menu, or their ingredients (two different ones). Although they were slammed with people, the waitresses seemed inexperienced and had a lot of stains on their clothes. Busing the tables amounts to lifting off the white plastic table cloths and dumping the trash, I guess. It's like eating on the top of a garbage bag. I expected something more authentic, some semblance of service, and a cut above a pre-trash table setting. You can probably do better elsewhere; this isn't even as good as Joe's Crab Shack. There is no decor save for a few Mardi Gras-ish things they must have found at a party store, has all of the ambience of a WalMart restroom.",

    "text": "Super good food! My friends and I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, calamari, and fried catfish!  We ate it allllll up.  My only concern was that the crabs were a bit difficult to crack but then again I'm used to cracking the Alaskan crab legs.  But other than the difficult cracking, the mix of all the seasonings was just a great fusion of flavors to really individualize their seafood from anything I've ever tried.  And it was not primetime when we went so service was pretty fast! Hope they're on top of their game when it is busy!",

The pound of shrimp with corn, potatoes and sausages is what we usually order. The hot and juicy sauce is awesome!be aware that even the mild has a good amount of spicy! Fun place to get your hands dirty and have some good, fresh seafood",

    "text": "I usually go to the original spot because I always think the OG is better. Unfortunately, our taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong one. Since we were already here, we might as well try it. This was my parents' first time trying this spot so I wanted them to have a great time.   The spot was definitely more spacious than the original, which was good. Our greeter was very accommodating and sat as relatively quickly. Unfortunately, our server ended up being this tattooed chick, Cam. Bad luck. Right off the bat, she was not very friendly and seemed to rush us. Since it was my parents' first time, I wanted them to take their time to inspect the menu. I ended up ordering for all of us. She was rushing like she had somewhere else to go, even though the place wasn't too packed. The wait was not very long but things were missing. I constantly had to ask for things like crab crackers, missing orders, and she probably only refilled our drinks once. Our waitress was more concerned about hugging her friends that came in than doing her job. I had to ask servers from other tables for refills, additional orders, etc because when we wanted anything, Cam was nowhere to be found.   By the time we finished eating we were still missing rice and another order. I decided to cancel those because who knows when I would get them. I don't usually appreciate bad service, but I'm especially concerned when I'm trying to introduce my parents to a new place on their anniversary. The food was good but the service we received from Cam that day was horrible! Because of this, I will stick to going only to the original spot from now on. If my parents didn't enjoy the food I would've taken it down 2 more stars.  Hot n Juice = good Cam = horrible",

    "text": "I prefer this location to the older/original only because there is less of a wait and more spacious. I also tend to be a little claustrophobic when I am eating.  I always have a go-to when coming here: Crawfish w/ The Hot & Juicy Special in HOT. Muy caliente. Be careful, Hot will get your sinuses running and that's only a level 3 (out of 4)- Trust me, I like my food spicy! Medium also has a kick to it.  I love that sauce, so much that I will usually order fries to use to soak up the excess. Corn is also delish slathered in that sauce. I also always ask for lemon, salt, pepper- must be an Asian thing.  Crawdaddies don't really fill me up so I will usually order some shrimp as well. They don't really seem to absorb the sauce as well though...  Everything served here is finger food and very casual. I caved in and started wearing the plastic bibs offered- can't risk staining my clothes. It's bad enough that the smell of garlic permeated anything that enters the premise. I literally have to wash the insides of my nose with soap when I get home or I will be smelling garlic for the next couple of days.  I also remember entering a contest and being a finalist in their 2012 calendar, I forgot what the perks were, but it would've been nice to  win and maybe get free crawfish out of it. lol",

The crawfish was spot on and delish, the corn and potatoes were amazing drenched in the sauce...angels played harps in my head as I ate each bite.  The fried catfish was dirty tasting just the way a good fried catfish should be, and the Cajun fries were incredible.    With all that said, the whole \"good for kids\" part of yelp that says yes should have a discriminating clause that says not for 20 month old toddlers in a booster seat.  3 spilled drinks, dirty hands in plastic gloves, and an untied down toddler made for an interesting experience to say the least.  I will be back with my appetite sans offspring for another few pounds of boiled shellfish heaven.",

My only complaint was that even the \"medium\" level was still so spicy! But anyway, fairly priced menu items, in my opinion. Good-sized portions. Very friendly staff members. I will definitely be going back again. :)",

My friend joined me that year and agreed that Hot N Juicy was just that. Since we had a group of 10+ we ordered almost everything on the menu except for the crawfish and lobster. I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins! 2nd experience: \"Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you.\" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute! I was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J. Last notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.  I'm the type that can't handle Hot Cheetos....This place gets super crowded so it's best to try to get there before the dinner rush if you can.",

I was bummed out that the sausage was on the chewy side and we also got Cajun fries and they weren't crispy, it was more on the soggy side so those few things I probably wouldn't get again. I also have a little one that I ordered water for and they gave me a styrofoam cup with no lid... that's literally a spill waiting to happen considering how hands on it is eating here, so I had to request for a lid which was no problem but it would be nice if they had a kid cup.

    "text": "The sausage was SPICY, holy moley (flushed)! It wasn't even my order but we were sharing everything we ordered and I wanted to take that whole thing and just put it in front of me :-). First time here with friends and it is now bookmarked because I'm so coming back. I'm definitely ordering the sausage again with rice. They have all booths on the right side of the restaurant and all tables on the left. It's a small space so I'm sure it gets very crowded but we came here right when they opened so it was perfect for me. I had coffee with me and they didn't let me bring it to the table (boo!).   We also ordered the calamari, regular and cajun- I just love calamari, I see it on the menu, I order it. It's a given. Both were very good as well.   Shrimp by the pound- I was not in the mood to peel so I didn't touch that but I did order the fried shrimp basket with fries so I got my fix.   Overall: Fun place I'm looking forward coming back to with the family.",

The shrimp was good but was too watery, I felt like the taste was wasted in the water instead of it being in the shrimp. Crab legs and green mussels were amazing! By the way, I ordered everything spicy Cajun and didn't even feel any tingles. Lastly, the sweet potato pulled everything together taste wise. The only icky annoyance was that the place was stuffy and too small; when I got out it smelled like shit to be honest . It was a pretty good dining experience overall but I don't think that I want to come back. If you don't care about the feeling of dining with the next table and smelling dog shit when you get out then you would love the place !",

Hot N Juicy sets the bar for Cajun seafood not just in Vegas but anywhere I've been to (LA boiling crab included). The food is served as soon as it leaves the pot and steaming in the bag with some of the freshest seafood you can get in town! The hot N juicy special has all the flavor of garlic buttery goodness you could want (I'd recommend an extra cup of sauce on the side to dip). Would not hesitate to bring the whole family back, this location in particular has the quickest service and sat our group of 12 in under 5 minutes for Sunday lunch. Can't wait to go back",

The difference to me with Hot N Juicy and Bowling Crab is the amont of butter they use. You can tell Hot N Juicy has more of sweetness in their flavor when the bag of shrimp comes out. Bowling Crab is different in a way that they have more butter added to the bag. So it really depends on the type of person you are and how you like your food to be served. This is a great place to get some seafood and have some fun with your hands.",

Not *once* did my water cup get filled the entire hour that we were there. All the waitstaff is running around frantically trying to turn-and-burn when this place is busy, and it's almost always busy. They seem hyper focused on clearing tables and seating new guests. What happens in between (table service) doesn't seem like a priority. Get ready to get up out of your seat if you actually need something. Like you're hailing a taxi!  This was my 25th or so visit to the HNJ chain of restaurants, and the first time ordering their black mussels. These black mussels are small, shrunken and the orange meat variety. The clams are much better, but unfortunately they were sold out of clams on this last visit. I would definitely not order these mussels again.  Call ahead to make sure they have the protein you want?  Taste note: the garlic in the Hot N Juicy sauce is plentiful, potent and on the rawer side so be prepared if you re-dip your shrimp after you peel...",

Shrimp was seasoned with HnJ medium. (Shrimp was possibly not in season as there were a few mushy textured pieces (reason for 4 stars).   Crab was seasoned with the same HnJ medium and was fine no mushy texture.  Sausage was added to the shrimp and was great  Rice was just good ole rice  All in all a great idea to take it home if you don't mind your car smelling like garlic and seafood for the next 3 days haha",

    "text": "Never having gone to the first HnJ, my brother, Katrina M., and Aziz B. decided to avoid the hoopla of the original, and head towards the second location. The interior was open and modern. Service was a bit slow, and at times, left us fending for ourselves in pursuit of bibs and gloves.  As for food, we ordered a pound of the Hot N Juicy special, spicy crawfish with sausage, two pounds of the HnJ special, extra spicy shrimp - both with corn and potatoes - as well as some fried shrimp. The seafood were around $11, fluctuating according to market price. Corn was .75 cents, potatoes .60, and sausage 2.75 for half a dozen. For the four of us, we were shed blood, sweat, and tears from the meal (perhaps not the first, but you get the picture). When they say Extra Spicy, they mean it. But the crawfish was good as a commodity (necessary for a first time). The shrimp though? That's where it's at. Succulent, packed with flavor - those babies were my favorite. As for its fried counterpart, the cornmeal breading was a bit overbearing and fully encompassing. It didn't stop us from devouring it as refuge from the spiciness of Extra Spicy. For about 60 dollars, this was more than enough among the four of us.  I love the idea around HnJ - communal and casual eats. Good food around people who love you despite your barbaric eating habits. As for the technicalities of a restaurant, service could be better. But I don't expect much from a place with plastic tablecloths.",

They totally ignored me the whole time until I flagged them down to asked for them for something like the salt, black pepper, & lemon supposed to come with the order  and more water. They sold me frozen crawfish and told me they were live and fresh. They lied bc the live and fresh ones are fleshy, juicy, red, hard and not black, soft or don't fall apart and in the entire one pound bag were all small ones except for one huge one on there when are served in the bag.

The only thing I must say is that you do have to be willing to get over the giant shrimp heads, eyes, & whiskers! (I had no idea) What disappointed me though, was the service, the server didn't seemed interested in being there, and unconcerned when we asked questions. Also, the portions are very big when it comes to the shrimp! I asked the server if she thought I should get a half a pound or whole, and she answered that the half only came with a few shrimp and gave a face like not a good choice, so I got the full pound and my hubby not that big on shrimp, got the half. I wished I had a picture, but the half was more than a few shrimp, and perfect to suffice any shrimp lover, so I did feel misled, as far as that goes. Needless to say, I ended up giving my grandmother the rest of my shrimp from my pound! It also took a good 15 minutes to get someone to come by with our check, even after my husband told our server. I'm not sure if we will be returning to this location or even the restaurant for that matter due to the service, which I'm all about, lol. There are plenty of other places like this around, that probably make you feel  more welcome and have excellent service!",

They wanted to know what day I dined so that they could investigate to find out what may have gone wrong with my meal.  I'm impressed that they care enough about their customers to followup and try to prevent any problems they can find so future diners won't have a similar experience.  Every restaurant can have a bad day, or bad product that is unknown as the product was properly prepared.   Everyone else in the place was having a great time and loving the food.  I heard no complaints, just praise, and trust me there is no way I could not hear what the people were saying ;-D.  This restaurant was listed in the top 30 must eat meals in Las Vegas and I can see why.  While I may have had some difficulties, I would still recommend eating there to other friends, especially if they want to have a good time with their meal.   Based on the chance my experience was unique, that everything I did eat was very tasty, and that this company cares as much as they do - I will be going back again another day to give them another chance.  I hope it's good.  This is the kind of place I would like to bring a group of friends to for a tasty meal and a great time - something everyone else in the place seemed to be having that night.  Service was excellent in any case.",

    "text": "Experience:  I had been eyeing this place since I first moved here. Being a native Louisianaian, I was happy to see a spot that had crawfish.  I mean, I am a True head-sucking, tail-eating fool!!!  Most crawfish I have eaten has been a crawfish boil at someone's house.  Then some friends wanted to go to Hot and Juicy, and I definitely joined the party.   Service:  One of our friends at the table also worked here, so we were treated very well. Not really sure how the wait staff would be without our VIP.   Food:  Ok, I'm probably not the best person to critique the food, because I'm a little biased of what good crawfish is.  We did order a whole bunch of seafood for the table, because they have many other things...we had crawfish, crab legs, muscles, shrimp, and clams.   I started out with the crawfish...of course...and was immediately thrown off with the heavy garlicky almost sweet flavor of the boil it was in. I tried all the other seafood, but just did not care for this flavor no matter what the host.  The friend that works here suggested I order the Louisiana style, so I jumped all over that.  I ordered the crawfish extra spicy too!  It was much better than the original flavoring, but still not like home. I guess I'm just a crawfish snob.   Overall review:  I won't be back anytime soon.  I will save my crawfish cravings to be satisfied when I go home to Louisiana to see my kin folks.",

My friend ordered a lobster at approximately 7:20pm. Everyone else, including those who arrived closer to 8pm ordered and received their food before my friend did. We inquired 3 times about his order, making sure his order was in fact taken. We were reassured that it was. In the interim, my friend was so hungry. He was able to get bits and pieces from what the rest of us ordered. At 8:35pm, over an hour after he ordered he got his lobster.   When I spoke to Jillian, the manager on duty that night about the situation, her reply was \"There's nothing we can do. It's Friday night and we're dealing with two big groups.\" Excuse me, but if you're establishment is so popular, yet you are not prepared to handle such business, then perhaps you don't deserve to be so busy. I mean there are plenty of places that would either employ enough staff to handle their clientele. At the very least Jillian could've offered a discount or something. Her nonchalant non-cooperative attitude was less than desirable.   I would also add that the lack of greens (collard, okra, spinach) would make me rethink visiting any HnJ anywhere.   The bright side of all this was Cassandra who was a positive and enthusiastic server, hence any stars whatsoever.",

The seafood is a good size and the flavors are wonderful.  Now my only gripe about this place is the service is terrible and seems to be getting worse. We usually go to boiling crab because we get such crappy service at hot n juicy now.   Went here tonight for dinner and our food came out promptly. And everything was ok but the server literally was inches away from our table and never bothered to ask if everything was ok. He did that a few times and I saw him looking at our table but he never said everything ok? My boyfriends beer was empty halfway through the meal and he didn't ask if he wanted another one, I wanted a water refill and he never came. The worst part is we finally put our napkins and bibs on the table indicating we were done and he just looked at us and then walked away to bus a table behind us. We clearly wanted the check. He then refilled my water but I was done eating already.   And I know he knew we were done but he never came with the check. We finally had to ask another server right in front of him for our tab. I guess because they know people will keep coming to this place so they don't care about service.   So I'm sure nothing will change and they will continue to hire servers who don't care about doing their job.",

The service was alright, they didn't fill up our water unless we asked for a few times.  The food tasted okay, not as good as the ones I've tried in the bay area. I would try other Cajun style restaurant in LV area the next time when I visit to compare.  We asked them to call a cab for us when we left, they seemed annoyed by calling one for us; we waited for another 20min for the cab to arrive.",

It did look intimidating not knowing what to do and order but the waitress was amazingly helpful, even gave us recommendations and caution us about the spicy levels(Huge help!). They sell by the pound and by market price. We ended up getting Three lb of craw fish, two fries, Two lb of Shrimp, dozen of sausages, half a dozen oysters, and rice. Came out to $95 for four people and to us it wasn't a bad deal for first time experience.  if you are willing to pay around $20-30 for seafood and fun way of eating then this is an amazing spot!",

My wife has done crab legs and crab; I've done the Crawfish. We've both done the Shrimp.   My suggestion; stay with the shrimp. Order it to your spice level of comfort.   I like the Cajun Fries, my wife likes the Sweet Potato Fries.   Go early, or you will have a tough time finding parking and be greeted with a long wait.   It is pricey, but a great eating experience. We have taken my wife's relatives and friends from Korea to this place, and they always want to come back and make it their last meal before they return to home.   Not a great place for a first date, but great for someone you're very comfortable with, who isn't into trendiness and snobby atmospheres.",

Yes it can be expensive if you want certain seafood such as lobster, but if you go for the experience then it'll be a good time.   I can easily do this myself, but hey- it'll be a mess so why not leave the mess at hot n juicy.  The flavours were bang.   II would go back as I enjoyed my experience and the food. Lobster, snow crab legs and shrimp. Lobster was not much meat since we only enjoy the tail. So, lots of meat wasted and expensive.",

I love a little spice to my food, but not too much where my nose is running. With that said, I get the shrimp with the Hot n' Juicy season mild. No surprise here that I have to order a side of cajun fries. I feel like you can't go to these types of restaurant and NOT order a side of cajun fries.  The only difference with the sauce is that this one seems a tad bit sweeter than Boiling Crab. I'm still a lover either way =) This place also has a bigger selection on beer.  So if you're into cajun food, but want to drink tons of beer as well - this place takes it over Boiling Crab. Although both places are good and you can't go wrong with either.",

The waiter said to try and drown it in butter and provided some additional bowls of rice... he added that to the bill BTW.  Bottom line is that this place is good, and the food tasty.  Just beware of the spicy heat.  I find it unbelievable that their \"mild\" garlic butter is in-fact super spicy-hot.  Either the waiter or cooks were smoking something...",

    "text": "To top off an eventful Vegas weekend, we decided to come to Hot N Juicy and see how they do cajun seafood in Sin City. To my surprise, this location was not very packed on a Sunday afternoon, and there was plenty of seating, even for our group of 12.  The best bang for your buck at places like this is shrimp. When you get crawfish, you're throwing half of your money away because you can only eat the tail. Not worth it. I got a pound of Hot N Juicy Special Shrimp, Medium Spicy with a side of corn. The shrimp here are a hefty size (I'd say size 16/20) and the sauce is outstanding. I tend to stay away from spicy food, but even Medium was just the right level. If you get mild, the spice is nonexistent. A good combination of flavors that matches the shrimp well.   The employees are all very friendly and highly efficient. Our orders came out within 10 min and water was constantly refilled. Our waitress, Loreal (Never heard that name before, but that's what my friend said was on her name tag), did a fantastic job with our large group, and managed to throw in a few jokes here and there. It's hard to find real down to earth wait staff these days, but she's an exception.   Overall, I was left stuffed, barely able to walk, and very satisfied. Best of all, there was no London Blitz to follow it, if you know what I mean.",

Shrimp were very good, seasoning excellent, but the lobster severely lacked in flavor. Also had to wait 5 minutes after the lobster was delivered to receive the cracker tool to eat the lobster.

I really wish they opened one in northern Cali!!!  I had a memorable time here and will never forget Hot N Juicy. I think we took the cab here from our hotel from the strip but going back was WORK. I totally forgot that cabs don't stop for you on the side of the road, but I didn't know that applied anywhere else too... SO... the whole group walked back to the strip all the way from Chinatown.

Service was attentive (by multiple people) and one of the employees showed us how to peel/eat the crawfish. The sauce we chose for the food was garlic butter and it was fantastic. The seafood was tender and flavorful. My hands still smelled like the seasonings after many hand washings. Guess we should have used gloves.

The spice level is a little off, so go for the spice level below the one you are use to because even the baby spice had a kick! Worth a trip here if you come to vegas for the strip.",

    "text": "This location is not as nice as the one down the street. There's less seating, less parking, and it's just more rundown. However, the food is so good, if the only location was underneath a bridge and the chef was a homeless guy, I'd still eat there!  As far as the food goes, if you love messy finger food that comes equipped with a bib, you'll love Hot and Juicy. Their spice is not for the faint of heart! Even their mild spice has a good amount of kick. So far I've tried their shrimp, crawfish, corn fritters, and fries. You have to peel the shrimp and crawfish yourself.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it's part of the experience.  Don't waste your time or money on the crawfish.  Big creature, small amount of meat.  1 lb of shrimp in Hot N Juicy seasoning is the way to go.   Keep in mind that when you order by the pound, that includes the weight of the entire shrimp body, antennas, legs, and the juice. Their seasoned fries are burn-your-face-off spicy, and with all the spice in the shrimp, I found it overwhelming. Their corn fritters are crispy, creamy, sweet balls of corny goodness.  They pair perfectly with the spicy shrimp.  For those who have children or unenthusiastic seafood eaters in your group, they also offer things like chicken strips and popcorn shrimp on their menu.  Oh and unless you want your fingers to burn for hours after the meal and garlic scented fingertips for the next week, WEAR THE GLOVES!",

Here's the deal: you buy a bag of seafood, pick your sauce, and they dump it on the table. We got 1 lb. of shrimp and 2 lbs of crawfish, as per our server's recommendation -- and it was WAY too much for 2 hefty, hefty eaters. The shrimp, especially. Ye gods. Now, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there is a lot of meat on each plump and tender morsel.  My favorite was the crawfish, with their signature sauce. It's incredibly flavorful, and the red potato and corn can't be beat. You pick it apart with your bare hands. My fingertips got bath-tub wrinkled. How primal. Yes, you can ask for gloves. Yes, you're less of a (wo)man for doing so.   Anyway, well worth a quick cab or car ride from the strip, not too expensive for what you get, cute waitresses. And you get a calendar. Bravo!",

One cab dropped us off at their second location. We were bummed about the situation until the host offered to take us, at no extra charge, to the other location. So awesome. Thank you Nick.  We ordered the crawfish, chicken wings, soft shell crab, calamari, and shrimp...all spicy. Everything was spectacular. Super juicy crawfish, full of flavor. Potatoes and corn were perfectly cooked too.  The deep fried food were extra crunchy. I highly recommend the soft shell crab and chicken wings.  This is probably one of the best crawfish joint I've been too.",

    "text": "Arguable when comparing to Boiling Crab, but personally, I prefer BC.  HJ is certainly much more juicier and spicier and though I did not give anything else but shrimps a try, I was disappointed.  For one, once I peel off the shell of the shrimps, there is remaining meat that is the size of a fingernail. I like to eat big so that was disappointing. It was a lot spicier for I was struggling with my life to diffuse the spices in my mouth.  On the other hand, the fries were as good as you get anywhere else. Like I always say, if you mess up on fries, something is wrong with you.  In conclusion, I prefer Boiling Crab. It's just preferential that I like my shrimps larger. But I give HJ 3 stars because they do a good job in explaining their styles and overall good service. Nevertheless, I don't see myself coming back here for enjoyment purposes.",

With this in mind, I decided to go with a basketof chicken nuggets and sample food my husband and friends ordered. I was right, I am not a fan. People in the group ordered several seasonings, lemon pepper, cajun, etc. I found that once you peeled the shrimp, they didn't really taste to anything. i would have preferred the shrimp be peeled first then cooked with the seasonings.

I knew about this place thru a cousin's yelp check in on Facebook. So we decided to try it while on vacay...this is a MUST stop for all you visitors!    The first time we went, we visited the old location which doesn't compare to this newer location at all. This location is a lot bigger and more staff and most of them are cute and cut even the females look great.    So first time at the old location- what we had:    4 lbs of their crawdads...these are a waste of your money - most of these pinchers were about less than half an inch in size and were a pain to crack! Hubby ordered the spicy Hot n Juicy special and it was definitely HOT!!!  4 lbs of shrimps - THE BEST!!! Lemon Pepper is the bomb!  LP is my favorite, if you like the taste of lemon grass you'll definitely love this flavor.  Chicken Wings with fries - great  Calamari - yummy!  Sweet Potato fries - so yummy!   total for this visit - $162.00 for a party of 10 with 4 kids and 6 adults   2 nights later- we visit this new location...we just can't stop talking about it. It's that good!   What we ordered this time around:   5 lbs of shrimps...Garlic Butter, Louisiana, Lemon Pepper  2 Calamari Chicken nuggets with fries 7 orders of rice!!! - A MUST!!! 2 Sprite  2 beers   Total: $124.00   Spoon some of that juicy goodness on top of your rice and eat with your fingers!!! You can't let that sauce go to waste!!! DAYMN...just thinking about it makes my mouth water :)",

Just be sure you do not have paper cuts on your hands, you'll definitely get a sting, but it's so good that you ignore it and keep eating.  I read a handful of reviews and aside from the crawfish, many recommended the fried shrimp. Of course it was ordered and they were definitely right.  The cornmeal batter was not piled on the butterflied shrimp so that it's lost.  Another thing too is the batter stuck to the shrimp. It came out piping hot, enjoyed every bit of it.  Showtime.  I decided to go with 2 pounds of the crawfish, hot and juicy special sauce and I went with medium spice level.  I asked the server for spicy, but she highly recommended medium because it's rather spicy.  I was hesitant at first since, but fine, I went with it, what do I know. I chose or well, she did, correctly.  The hot and juicy special sauce was full of fresh garlic, delicious!  I ordered a side of rice, piled on the sauce into the rice bowl, highly recommended.  The crawfish was hit or miss.  I say this because some were larger than others, some where cooked right, some were so overcooked, the tail had zippy in it.  Regardless, it was still an experience and worth it.  Twist, suck, pull, chomp.  Service was good as busy as this place was.  Beers are cheap, can't complain.  Highly recommended to visit your local Hot N Juicy.  Expect your fingers to smell like sea when you leave, it's definitely worth it.  My paper cuts on my fingers healed the next day, thank you very much.",

With this being a Tuesday, it was a good time to get in here as its always crowded on the weekends. Overall, the crawfish was on point and so were my wife's shrimp. Make sure to get them boiled in the garlic butter, or other seasonings as it makes it that much better. If you have a chance to make it out during the week, please do it.

I like my food spicy but that day I was not feeling spicy. The medium has perfect spice. The crawfish was so good we had to order 5 more pounds. LOL. The clams were okay because they were a little undercooked. But overall the food was excellent.",

We got seated after about 5 minutes. Server asked us what we wanted to drink about 10 minutes after being seated. He came back, took our order, and the food took about another 10-15 mins. Which wasn't bad.  However, 1) we never got bibs 2) we never got cutters for the crab, we had to ask a different server for it 3) our server didn't check up on us till we were just about done eating.  The food was okay. I should have gotten Baby Spice instead of Mild because it was hotter than I expected. Our stomachs were really upset after eating. I also noticed another person sitting near us who complained about her stomach being sore as well.  I would go back to Hot N Juicy Crawfish but maybe I'll try out the other location instead. I'm rating it 3/5 stars because the customer service was terrible.",

    "text": "I was really hoping this place was going to be as good as on the reviews but I have to say this is the worst place I've ever had crawfish at. Maybe it's because I'm just use to the flavors in Houston?...probably not because I've had good crawfish in San Diego and New Orleans. So maybe I just don't like the taste of frozen crawfish? My crawfish tasted like it was over-cooked and lacked salt. Even though I got their most popular flavor 'hot n juicy' and my fiance got their 'garlic butter' our crawfish tasted exactly the same. I had to send it back. I'm pretty disappointed because I really wanted to like this place. If they wouldn't have taken the crawfish off my bill, I would have given them a 1 star (so thanks Hot N Juicy).   Other than the crawfish, I think the rest of the food is good. My friend got the snow crab and she said it was good, and her Cajun fries (although received after she was practically done with her meal) were good too.",

    "text": "One of the best seafood spots in Vegas in my opinion. The service is, mediocre. At best. But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer.   We started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else!   The snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!  Overall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy! Great seafood, great experience, and great sauces!",

    "text": "I was so excited to try Hot N Juicy Crawfish, given how well known they are for their crawfish. Unfortunately, I left pretty underwhelmed after my visit last week after trying my Hot N Juicy medium spicy crawfish.  Positives: the flavor was quite good. It had the perfect amount of heat, spice, garlic, and all other types of yumminess. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.  Negatives: I'll start in chronological order from when I got there. Seeing the 10.99/lb price tag was like a slap to the face! I'm used to paying a fraction of that price for larger, fresher, and equally tasty crawfish. This leads me to my second point: many of the crawfish were mushy, tiny, and some of the tails weren't attached to the heads. Disappointing...  Negatives continued...the service left something to be desired. While the server was very enthusiastic, she had difficulty understanding basic concepts. If you order 2 lbs of the crawfish, you automatically get a potato and corn included with your order. She charged my friend for an extra order of corn and potato to my friend's receipt and could not grasp why this was incorrect. Who knows how many other people have been upcharged for extra corn and potatoes. She didn't know how to remove this from the receipt so my friend ended up paying for something extra she didn't ask for because she didn't want to deal with the headache of explaining this again and again. :/  In summary, it seems like this is a popular place that many people frequent and even give great reviews and high accolades. It may be disappointing for people who have easy access to crawfish, have been to many'a crawfish boils, and know what good crawfish should taste like. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all the hype is about, but I'll get my crawfish-fix elsewhere.",

Very nice... They seat you then hand you the very short and straight to the point menu. I ordered the crawfish.. They were a bit pricey compared to Texas at $10.99lb and I also ordered the snow crab legs which were $16.99lb... The sweet potato Cajun fries were amazing as well!. They don't serve wine or champagne by the glass so I had to purchase an entire bottle for $24.99. I ordered the hot and juicy special and the spice level was HOT! They were awesome!",

We waited maybe 5 more mins and then were seated.  The menu offers a variety of seafood in different flavors and spices.  We ordered the crawfish in Hot and Juicy flavor in a medium spicy level and shrimp in the Lemon Pepper flavor, also a medium spicy level and two pieces of corn.    The food came out quickly and we put on our bibs and got to cracking.  I've never eaten a crawfish before so it was interesting.  It seems like a lot of work for not so much to eat.  But it was fun nonetheless.  After awhile, the spices got too spicy for me (on a medium level).    Of the two flavors, I definitely like the lemon pepper better.  But the best part of the meal...the corn!!",

If your from Texas or Louisiana you will laugh at the size of these baby crawfish. I've seen crickets and grasshoppers bigger than this on my back patio! The service was great and friendly. I also tried the crab and it was not fresh and it was a 1.8 lb crab and there was very little meat the little meat I could get from the claws was so over steamed it was mush: the fries, potatoes and corn were ok. The shrimp was the best. It reminded me of a Joe's Crab Shack as for the quality of product. The tab was $78.00 and I definitely didn't feel it was $78 quality. I know others have given 5 stars but I'm from the south and I can only imagine this is the best they can get out here.",

The Hawaiian sweet rolls were crusty hard, HELLO that is not how they are supposed to be served.  Do not expect tremendous amazing service it was very casual and they were young and busy and seem to just want to make sure you got your beverages and order and that was IT! I think their clientele isn't necessarily looking for more so I get the feeling that is why they don't try harder.  My advice if you are a local order take out. If you are a visitor take heed.

That was delicious! 1 pound shrimp, 1 pound crawfish and 1 pound blue crab later licking my fingers with burning lips ends off a good dinner. I love the lemon pepper sauce! We ordered two sides of corn and my corn was soaked in the lemon pepper sauce until the end of the meal finishing it like it wa my dessert :) I usually do not like spicy food but here I got with a medium for a kick. Which to me is spicy but probably to others is not spicy at all! I go and eat at Hot n Juicy every time I am in town. I wish they had one in Salt Lake! I probably would go everyday. lol. We did have to wait about half hour on a Friday night. All the servers help each other out which you don't see often at restaurants. They work as a team and that is amazing. There are two locations in Vegas so if you cant wait at one go to the other to see if there is a wait.",

We always go to Hot N Juicy the first day when we land and usually have crawfish everyday we are there during our trip.  We come a few times a year from the midwest.  We were very disappointed with the new location.  Poor service the waitress ordered us double of everything, she rarely came by, we had to ask for everything from other servers which didn't seem so friendly, and they over charged us for duplicate orders the waitress messed up on.  When we walked up to pay for bill and have the mistakes adjusted the waitress was rude!  Next the hot n juicy sauce tastes different more watered down and all canjun.  I found more dead crawfish in my two lb bag then fresh ones and the food was so disappointing that we didn't even finish our food.  We usually start with 2lbs and end with at least 4-5lbs each.  The new ratings are right food doesn't seem as fresh, poor service, and the flavors are different.  We need more consistency.  I didn't want to go to the new place because you take that chance it's not the same different cooks and I lost my appetite for hot n juicy for this 4day vacay.  Maybe before we go home we will try it one more time at the original location and get the real taste of the hot n juicy sauce with more thick tangy juicy tastes and not watered down Cajun like any other crawfish joint.",

Today I left my keys on the table, silly accident. I was positive the keys were on the table. I called twice & no one seemed to help. So I came up there being that I was positive I left them there. So instead of the back & forth w/ my server about what he did do and why he couldn't have threw them away. I asked if I could look myself, after all it's my fault and my keys so I have no problem finding them. I can't blame him for not wanting to help look it's a seafood restaurant so it was pretty gross. Juan, who was not my server btw, got in the dumpster & found my keys. I then tried to tip him for helping me. Being that he just saved me money on a new starter and he didn't even accept it. Awesome. Thanks so much Juan I really appreciate you for getting dirty for me.",

    "text": "Went here with my cousins and aunt since I was only visiting for a day.  It was pretty busy for 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  We got seated right away, but waited a good 10 minutes before our server even acknowledged us - at least we were ready to order.  We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, sweet potato fries, 2 lbs of snow crab legs, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of crawfish, and bowl of rice for everyone.  The fries came out along with the oysters....but no water.  It was hard to flag someone down because we were sitting in the back of the restaurant and the servers were constantly going to the front.  We were practically done with our appetizers when the shrimp comes out.  OK, no water and no rice(hey, we're Filipino and we need our rice!)  Finally they bring us water along with everything else and we start munching down.  During the course of our meal we run out of water and we see our waitress asking the tables next to us if they wanted refills on their waters.  She had enough water to fill their cups and we thought \"great, she's gonna go refill her pitcher and come back to our table.\"  NOT!!  We constantly had to get up and ask them for stuff....not cool at all!!!  I don't care how busy you are - if you are a really good server you know how to take care of ALL your tables!!  The last time my cousin had to stand at the counter to ask for refills on our water another waitress came by to apologize for ignoring us.  At least they know they were ignoring us, but how convenient to apologize AT THE END when we have to pay.  Great food but lousy service!",

A  2 lb back of shrimp, a potato and a corn on cob full me up, that's for less than $10. The place is always crowded especially on weekends, because the food is good and affordable.",

The gloves are much needed, otherwise your hands will smell like seafood. They're not very durable, so you'll need to switch them out periodically while eating. Had 1/2 pound of shrimp with a pound of Alaskan King Crab Legs. Both with mild hot and juicy seasoning. Perfect seasoning, I'm in love. I would give them 5 stars if the price was a little lower. For the Alaskan King Crap, it was $28/lb. I didn't really care for the shrimp because it came with the whole body (head and body in the shell). Although it was all tasty, the shrimp head just wasn't appealing to me. Other than that, the place was clean and we didn't wait long for a table. Unfortunately, the night we came, they were pretty understaffed and it was definitely noticeable. I will definitely be returning in the near future (but maybe to the other location instead)!!!!",

I ALWAYS get their shrimp (its head-on) and the size is perfect. Unfortunately the cost of seafood continues to rise every time I come here. I get it, the price of seafood fluctuates due to market price but I can go to an Asian store, get the same shrimp and make my own clam bake for 1/3 of the price. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because we tend to wait FOREVER for our food, never fails. They give you the rice way in advance that by the time the food is actually served, the rice is cold and has formed a hard layer on the top. Those frustrations aside, the food is on point.",

Once we moved out of town we have tried to find a place like it and nothing ever compares! We came here tonight as we were visiting and had the \"Get your feet wet\" (crawfish, shrimp, corn and potatoes) and it did not disappoint! Great flavor with the perfect amount of spice! Service was awesome and quick as well. We had our food within minutes. We left with our bellies happily full, but after 10 min I had noticed that I forgot my watch on the table, so when I went back to get it, the guy ask what we had eaten and he literally stuck on some gloves and went digging into the big trash bin until he found my watch! So nice of him to do that for me! We will come back next time we are visiting Vegas not only because of the AMAZING food, but also the exceptional service!",

    "text": "We actually wanted to go try Boiling Crab but there was an hour & 45 min wait so I called Hot & Juicy and they said it would be 40-45 mins so we rushed over there instead.   Upon arriving, we were told there would be a 20-25 min wait which was even better so we just walked down the strip to a clothing store to shop & wait.   Once we were seated, we were shown the menu with the market prices (which I forgot to take a picture of) but we decided we only wanted shrimp that night so we got 2 pounds of medium Hot n Juicy, 1 pound of mild Hot n Juicy, 2 bowls of rice, & 2 orders of Cajun fries.   The shrimp was amazing, perfectly cooked with awesome flavor (I ended up pouring some on my rice lol), the spice was perfect but we'll probably go a level higher next time. The fries were also great, everyone loved them.   The service was also great, I believe we had Loren (sorry if I'm mistaken) but she was so sweet & she checked on us very often which I really appreciated.   The only thing I would change is the fact that the waiting space is so tiny/awkward so everyone is clumped up by the door, blocking it so people can't get in/out. We actually waited outside because I thought it would be weird to just stand in front of the people who were sitting on the bench.   Overall: great food, great service, good prices, definitely would recommend to family & friends. My cousin who has been to both Hot N Juicy & Boiling Crab said HNJ is definitely better.",

The food was good, in a super messy, peel your own stuff kinda way. They do offer gloves, and bibs, etc to reduce the delicious saucy consequences! But I have been to places like this before, I wore clothes that I would toss into the laundry if needed. But I did ok!   We ordered everything with \"Hot and Juicy\" sauce. My friend feels it is the best one, I cannot say, as it was the only one I had. Everything you order comes tightly wrapped in a plastic bag swimming in your sauce of choice. This is sounding fun, RIGHT? Well it is fun, if you let it be! We had a great meal!!  Dinner consisted of... Snow Crab Legs- Yummy! Green Lip Muscles- OK, these were my favorite. Easy to retrieve from the shell, lots of flavor! Really good!! Head on Shrimp - I thought these would be too much work, but I was wrong! They were great! Cajun Fries - Just to ad a little bit of fried goodness to the table. and lastly sliced cajun sausage - These were hands down the dud of the night. Soggy, tasted weird, yuck. I suspect they were old, and sitting in the bag of sauce did not help. Stick to the seafood! Or Fried stuff!!  Over All we had fun and enjoyed our meal. Service was awesome! Would I RUN back? I don't know. Would I go back, for sure!!",

I waited for the rest of my party and was seated as soon as they arrived. Randy was very friendly and patient as we were deciding how to order. We shared mussels, clams, sausages, shrimp, and cajun fries. We got the \"hot n' juicy\", baby-spice sauce and it was delicious. All of the seafood we got were huge. This place is so worth it! Will definitely come back for the amazing servers, food, and atmosphere!",

    "text": "OK so I was REALLY REALLY looking forward to getting my Lousiana style crawfish / seafood. I've been missing my Boiling Crab in Cali. This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a \"lower grade\" of seafood meat.  Anyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness. I loved the corn on the cob, as usual.",

I like that they provide you with bibs and gloves, it was fun to get a little messy with my 11 and 4 year olds. It's a great spot to take kids because you wouldn't have to worry about the mess and cracking open the crawfish and crab were fun.  The size of the shrimp was decent, crawfish was decent but I still have to find \"my sauce\" I'm pregnant and after this meal at lunch time I was full the entire day until dinner time.  Service was good. It was a bit hArd to get our servers attention because the place was packed but overall it was good and I'd like to give it another try.",

I waited ten minutes before someone got me seated (it was also the first time I actually interacted with someone working--I do wish they'd been a bit more communicative).  I had the soft shell crab po boy with sweet potato fries for dinner. Now, bear in mind--I was hungry. Very hungry. So maybe that's biasing my assessment. But I dug the food; at the price point there was enough crab, and the sweet potato fries were a nice addition. I also ate pretty much everything on the plate.  The environment is a bit more like a bar, which is less desirable for me. But the staff were friendly and helpful--once they got me seated, anyway.  Thumbs up.",

Ask for extra sauce on the side to dip your proteins in.  I also went with lemon pepper per recommendation, but I already knew it would be kinda boring ...and it was. So stick with hot n juicy! So happy that they had live crawfish that day, but they were real dinky... bummer.   As for the fried baskets, I recommend the soft shell crab. Skip the catfish cause the texture was too soft.",

The mussels were gummy and felt like they had been cooked way before we ordered them. And the sauce on the shrimp and mussels were hotter then I remember and I used to order spicy!   Service was definitely on the slower side. Was seated for about 5 plus minutes before our server greeted us. All the fried foods got dropped off followed by the seafood and then the rice finally showed up after asking for it 3x. I'm been a server before and if someone asks me 3x for the rice, I'll go to the back and get it myself. I mean really- the rice sits in a cooker right? All you gotta do is scoop it out? So why wait for your runner to do it...just saying...",

About 25 minutes for them to bring out 2 lbs of shrimp. THEN, it took 40 minutes for my baby brother's chicken tenders to come out, which we had to speak to management about. But they took it off the bill for us which we appreciated.  Also, our given wait time was 5 minutes, but we sat in 15. We were not happy. As a word to management, it is always better to overestimate a wait time than have crowds of hungry, unhappy guests.  Most likely will go to a new location next time.",

    "text": "We always stop by Hot N Juicy while we're in Vegas. We've always had mediocre experiences, but come back solely for the food. This past visit, we waited for about 5-10 minutes for a table - not bad at all. Upon observation, I can tell the clientele is completely different from other places I've been and that could be one of the main reasons why service isn't so great here, which is a bummer.   I'm almost certain our server was new or he was just overwhelmed. We always stick to boiled foods when we come to these types of places, but we ended up opting for some Cajun Wings & Fries with our fresh crawfish. While ordering with him, he asked us how spicy we wanted the fries and we said Mild.   Our crawfish came out and was delivered by another employee. When our server came around to ask how everything was, we asked about the wings and he said, \"Oh sure, how spicy would you like the fries?\" I knew he had forgotten to place the order, but when I told him we had already ordered it, he recovered and said \"Oh yeah, it should be right out.\"  We saw a basket of wings and fries go to the table behind us and beside us - and both were seated and ordered after us. So that confirmed our order was forgotten. No big deal - we get that it happens, but own it. Our server definitely avoided our table until the order arrived. Wings arrived and they were nice and crispy, but T-I-N-Y. A complete joke of a basket for $10.99.   Also, save yourself from drinking tap water that has a funky taste and smell to it and order a soda or beer. The bill explicitly states \"Tap Water\". LOL and dumping lemon wedges in it definitely doesn't mask the taste/smell either.   2 stars for the service, additional star because the sauce is worth coming back for.",

Our waitress could have been more attentive to us but I can cut her a little bit of slack because she had around 5 other tables with full parties that she had to watch over.    Specifically on the food, it seemed a bit over priced compared to other restaurants in town (Boiling Crab).  I personally didn't order any seafood as I just ordered a catfish basket and tried my friends' seafood, which had too much sauce in my opinion which was swimming at the bottom of the bag.  As far as the restaurant itself, it's odd to have it as an L-shaped restaurant as opposed to a more open area.  There were a few TV's tuned to sports but they weren't very loud.  Overall, it won't be my go-to spot for Cajon food, but at least now I know.",

Every time I have friends or family fly in from out of town I take them to Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The first thing they say to me on their next trip to Vegas is \"Take me back for more of that Hot N Juicy!\" and then I tell them, \"Woah, slow down, I don't swing that way!\" And then I proceed to give them what they crave: Hot N Juicy Crawfish!  I have been going to the original HnJ ever since the Man V Food episode was filmed there, but the newest Hot N Juicy has a more special feeling to it. It definitely has a more youthful vibe than the older one.   Pro-life-tip #23: Take a first date here. If they can handle you being dirty and smelly, they can probably stick around for longer than a month. If they don't enjoy it, sounds like a one-night stand!  Favorite choices: Snow Crab Legs, Shrimp, Sausage (cant get enough of their meat!), and some of the best wings and fries in town!  The servers are all super friendly. Also, they like men who play with their food ;) *winkedy winky*  If you're looking for more than just dinner, definitely check this place out. It's a food expedition!",

Only issue really is that they only have 2 servers for the entire restaurant, so sometimes if they get busy it can be hard to get their attention.  Love the sauce, really flavorful and buttery.

We always get the hot n' juicy special for all of your seafood and its just so darn tasty I have to lick all my fingers!  They offer seafood sold at market price and by the pound: Shrimp Green mussels blk mussels clams snow crab king crab craw fish  and two other crab species that are seasonal.   Bibs and gloves are given to protect the digits and your clothing from splatter when you are eating.   We always try to go early. This place will always have some wait time so if you are in a large group plan ahead. We go to the one on Valley View and Spring mountain because it is the larger one on our side of town and the parking lot is a larger compared to the decatur location. Parking can be a hassle during peak business hours but there are lots behind the restaurant you can park at with a short walk.   Cajun fries are delicious and always served fresh and crunchy!

H&J's sauce is thick and goes perfectly with some steamed rice. Eat that ish with yo hands village style, straight from the table! cause it tastes better that way.  I find myself craving H&J alllllllllll the time!   The reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because BC has their seasoned fries and catfish/shrimp basket on LOCK. if you've never had it, it's a must try over there.  Also, I've had a bad oyster here before, and had severe stomach pains... I didn't know it was bad because I've never had a bad oyster before, but when that excruciating pain kicked in, I knew it was that last oyster I had right away. It tasted really bad too, but I just swallowed it quickly as a natural impulse. (that's what she said!)  I would still come back of course, I love hot n' juicy, but owners, if you're reading this, please make sure you train your staff well enough to differentiate bad oysters vs good ones.   Until next time H&J.. I will be dreaming about dat sawwwwwwse.",

I ordered the snow crab  and corn fritters, my friend ordered king crab and mussels. The menu is ala carte - you order an entree and choose which level of seasoning you desire. If you want to add bread, rice, or many others, have at it!  Your server will make sure your table is covered in plastic and when she presents you with your seafood, you can literally just dump it on the table and dig in! My snow crab was delicious, though you have to work for it by cracking the shells yourself. My corn fritters were not as great - kind of greasy and too bready, but that's not the main attraction.. There's a full bar to order cocktails should you desire to do so.. I opted for water as I was nursing a hangover, lol! The service was excellent and I can't wait to go again. Garlic butter sauce, yes please!!",

I also realized that it was then that I first had this type of food but honestly I don't remember that experience at all.  This time however, I'm sure I'll remember as it was AWESOME!  This location is cute with brick walls and booths, as well as tables that aren't squished together.  There are a number of flat screens along the walls but I honestly didn't even notice them.  We got a booth right away and our server was great.  She brought our waters, answered all our questions, and took our orders and it was all seamless.    We ordered a pound of shrimp, clams, 1/2 dozen sausage, 2 corns and some potatoes.  Everything came out within 15 minutes.  We were really impressed by the size of both the shrimp and the clams.  The clams were nice and plump and cooked perfectly.  They weren't rubbery at all, quite the opposite.  Also, the shrimp were cooked perfectly as well, which I was really happy about because both the last times I went to Boiling Crab, the shrimp were over cooked and tough.  I also found myself loving the HNJ sauce more than the \"Whole Shebang\" at BC.  It was much more flavorful and not as thick so it coated all the seafood evenly.  Everything was served really hot so you never felt like you were eating cold seafood.  Our server constantly refilled our waters and was really friendly. After being a BC fan for this long, I'm totally switching teams.  Team HNJ all the way!",

    "text": "MAN do i LOVE this place :). Finally, a restaurant that KNOWS spicy. Be ready to get down and dirty! They provide you with bibs, plenty of paper towels, and wet naps because you will be splashing sauce everywhere and using a lot of your hands.  I recommend the shrimp and lobster. Of course the lobster is the most expensive; however, once in a while it's SOOO worth the money. The clams are fantastic as well. My regular order is a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs EXTRA EXTRA spicy with 2 corn on the cob, a bowl of rice, and occasionally the order of lobster but that's rare because I don't want to spend a fortune every time I'm there $$$. The Hot n Juicy special sauce is by far my favorite, but the cajun is fantastic as well. I usually do one of each. They also have fresh oysters for appetizers, and you can also choose from blue crab, king crab, mussels, and of course, crawfish for your main course ;).   The service is always great because the staff works as a team, so there is almost always somebody to refill your water, grab you more plastic gloves, etc..   **HERE'S AN IMPORTANT TIP!**: you WILL stink of garlic after this meal. Possibly for over a day! The food is worth it, but don't go here before your work shift, the gym, or a night out with friends because nobody will appreciate your stench! A thorough shower afterwards is crucial!  Overall, I love visiting Hot N Juicy for the fun environment, quick and attentive service, the killer spicy cajun flavors, and to get full off of a ton of seafood! As much as I enjoy Boiling Crab, HnJ is still on top mostly because of their sauces. HnJ has more of a kick and intense flavors.",

That catfish basket was my favorite.  It was tender and juicy.  The light and crisp cornmeal flour crust that made that all important first bite a thumbs up.    During the whole meal, i could not help but compare it to my first dinner in a plastic bag experience at the Boiling Crab in LA.  They are both good and l can't decide which I like best.  I'm leaning HnJ just because it's in Vegas!  BUT...what if they were right next to each other?  Which would I choose?  Aw man, now it's difficult to decide.  I'm not going to cop out and say both.   HnJ has more heat than BC.  The medium spice at HnJ for example is hotter than BC's.  Seafood selection is about the same in both.  Service was better at HnJ.  Waiting time at HnJ was a lot faster than BC.  HnJ represents Cajun seafood better than BC.  Hot n Juicy wins!.",

    "text": "This is more of a service review than anything else. I love hot n juicy, it's always a great good quality experience. They're always on point with the seafood and the spice level. I'm not throwing any complaints to that. It's great!   This is more about how slow things took with getting out meal out and how long the gap was between food and our check to even cashing it out.   My first issue was that we ordered mozzarella sticks and fries with 2lbs of shrimp and we got each item one at a time. Our shrimp orders came out first and then about twenty minutes I asked the server about our fries and mozzarella sticks and they had to double check our order. It continued to take another 15 minutes to get our fries and mozzarella at this point we had finished our shrimp and just took the fries and sticks to go. It was such a bad relay from ordering to receiving it really ruined the experience.   An added fact to the ruined experience was that an action that should take only a few minutes took over 15 minutes. We asked for a check and to go boxes and it took an unnecessary amount of time to receive our check. I understand it was a Friday night and it gets busy. But an expedited process to get your check and cash out is key to a quick turnover and getting your wait down when you have one. I really wish it didn't take as long as it did to get everything situated.   Step up your game hot n juicy",

    "text": "So I am writing this review on behalf of a misfortune.  My family, friends and I always eat at this location, though I don't really leave a bad review, tonight really pushed it. And here's to why I left this review.   I ordered a to-go pound of shrimp \"BABY SPICE\" as also listed on receipt. Upon coming home and started eating, the sauce suddenly starts to become really spicy. I say this because by now I already know how they used to serve \"BABY SPICE\" being a regular here. I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it and excited to come home and eat. Turns out it wasn't quite as expected.  This was the 2nd time it happened to me. The 1st time was when we were eating in and I just let it go and let them redeem theirselves. However it happened again today and what's worst was it happen when I was really looking forward to it! PLEASE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY!",

They provide several seafood choices and different sauce/flavor options.  The blue crab is hard to eat, especially when they don't provide anything to open the hard shell with (unless you want to risk breaking your tooth chomping down on the shells).  The clams are okay. The taste can be overwhelming with the clams being drenched in the sauce. It was a little disappointing that there were several empty shells in the bag provided (even after scrapping the floor of the bag to see if the meat had fallen off).  I would recommend the shrimp! The sizes are big and tasty!  But overall, a messy but good eat!",

    "text": "HOT N JUICY SPICYYYY! . ** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #16 ** . I haven't been to this location in a very long time. My last couple of experiences were horrible in service as the servers preferred to be goofing around with their coworkers rather than making sure their guests actually had drinks while eating fiery finger licking goodness. The last time i had good service here was probably when Cam was supervising there but i believe she left to open the California locations. . I don't like to write bad reviews because... well... maybe there was a situation, but luckily i didn't have the need to write a bad one since finally w/ this visit it was a breath of FRESH air. I believe our server's name was Brandon or Randy.... pretty sure its Randy.... its just so loud in there since they are busy. This guy was our FRESH air... NEW... EAGER... HUSTLING!! We like our servers to be hustlers because they make money & we get what we need in a timely manner without having to ask. He was fast & one key MAJOR IMPORTANT thing for this style of restaurant.... DRINKS.... He kept my husband's BEER$$ FULL at ALL times especially since husband wasn't eating since he is on this no dairy thing but nice enough to keep me company. My soda was also full at all times.   . I asked.... since i am in the service industry too... how do you know when my drink is low? his response... \"you got the spiciest level sauce... your drink is always gonna be low\" HAHAHAHA such a simplistic answer. Good job on finding this GUY Hot n Juicy . We always order the Hot N Juicy Spicy:  SHRIMP which is always cooked to perfection where we can easily peel off the shell  DUNGENESS CRAB which i LOVE because me being korean.... i LOVE to eat the brain part with rice & some of that HOT N JUICY sauce  CORN FRITTERS are perfect when you need a little sweet creaminess to cool down your mouth. SNOW CRAB has a saltier meat which i love SALTY anything no matter how much everyone tells me its bad for you.  sweet potato & cajun fries just to get me full & extra Hot N Juicy Spicy Sauce because i love to take it home to eat with rice for a week.  When i say WE... i mean JUST ME.... eating.... =/ dont judge. . Overall I'm super glad i can come back to this location instead of having to drive all the way to the EASTERN location which the staff there are AWSOME as well.",

I usually order a half a pound of the mild Hot and Juicy Shrimp with 2 corns and a side of rice. The calamari (regular) is really good and the sweet potato fries always leave me craving for more. The oysters are good and of decent quality.   The service was amazing! We had two servers that were helping my party of 4 and they were friendly, attentive and very fun. They made the experience even a better one. We were even given a \"girls of hot n juicy calendar\" that had a selection of their workers from different locations holding seafood. It was really funny and fun to look at. We got a kick  out of the model dressed up in an elegant gown holding up crab legs. My friend made a joke saying \"When you're classy AF but got crabs...\" hahaha. The waitress thought it was hilarious. She also gave us mardi gras beads and bud light bottle openers. It was a great dine in experience.  I definitely like HnJ better than boiling crab! It still is fun but more warm (welcoming) and not as loud so you can actually hear what people at your table are saying. I feel like the shrimp are bigger and of better quality and the waitresses are more fun and personable.  If i I could, I would eat here every day!",

I was at the pool, met some people visiting, they said they were going here and invited us. Sure, why not. Ubered over here. They said they don't have Hot N Juicy where they live so they make it a point to come here. Hot n Juicy should feel flattered.   We arrived late to the party, bags on the table and gloves already on everyone. We ordered catfish for us. It never came and a server told us it wasn't even ordered. Too bad they don't have a alcohol options, only beer. We were really looking forward to another drink. We were really looking forward to another drink right from the strip.   We also had a vegan at the table. Unfortunately, she had nothing to eat besides corn and fries.   I enjoyed the individual personalities. Water got on a phone and he brought us rice in a bag to get the water out. That was very nice.   I think Hot n Juicy is a very unique experience for visitors and locals and the restaurant should acknowledge the guests feel that way and live up to it.",

Your food is served in a plastic bag and your drinks are in paper cups.  Make sure your dress casual, expect the possibility of a wait, (as it's located in a smallish space) and have a good time.               I for one was grateful for the cute little plastic bibs available.  Yes, everyone looks cute and it makes for a fun photo op.  But the fact is you get REALLY MESSY!     My guy and I had shrimp.  I chose the garlic butter, medium while my guy had the cajun, medium.  Both were very tasty. Others in our group had crawfish and combos.  All 6 of us enjoyed our food and the experience very much.",

    "text": "My favorite place for as the name states.... hot n juicy... but not crawfish, mainly shrimp ! XD Even having other places open with similar type and style, i still eventually come back to be completely satisfied.   I remember going to the original location, up the street, closer to Decatur a few times before this location opened. Due to the years that one's been running, and the small \"enclosed\" location, i was happy when this one opened. I believe it was called a different name before this one opened but it was similar in style. After that one closed, Hot n Juicy took over !  My best friend and I were happy. More open location. Brighter. Newer ! ! AND LESS SMELLY !   Parking can be a pain sometimes due to it being in a plaza with other popular restaurants like DJK and Pho Kim Long but still worth it. AND its still technically down the street from my house xD just a little farther down spring mountain than the original location....   Most TVs are easily viewable from almost any seat in the restaurant for those who love to watch sports or just to watch something while eating.   Prices for shrimp and crawfish is at $11.99/lb (As of 01/31/16).   My usual is Hot n Juicy Special (medium or spicy or maybe extra spicy - depending on the day) + a corn (MMMM SOAKS UP ALL THAT FLAVOR) and shared cajun fries (ketchup does cut the spice sometimes XD)  TIP: If you are like me and my friends, who refuse to use those oversized gloves... clean your hands BEFORE going to the restroom with some wedges of lemon. Lemon juice cuts smell and cleans well before you go to scrub up some more and finish off in the restroom :)",

They did forget our fries, but they brought it out for us as soon as we asked them for the fries. Definitely give a try to their crispy pork skin. It is a huge portion for 5 bucks and it is super delish!!",

    "text": "I've been craving shrimp & crab in garlic/butter for over a month now. I've read reviews and decided to give this place a try. I visited on 9-19-19.  Located off of Spring Mountain, in the strip mall where Lee's Sandwich is. It's to the left, a little ways down towards the end.   It was about 5:15 pm and it was busy. We requested a booth and there were none so we decided to wait on the side. The line quickly grew behind us.   Our server was London. She was great, very friendly, knowledgeable and patient considering this was our first time there. We had questions, she answered them with honestly which we appreciated.  We ordered: 1 lb. King crab 1 lb. Shrimp 2 Corn 1 Potato 1/2lbs Sausages 1 Rice 1 Cajun fries 1 Calamari w/cocktail type sauce  1 Diet coke  3 Corona beers  In garlic/ butter sauce- baby mild sauce Hot n' spicy mild sauce on the side  Butter sauce on the side  The garlic butter baby mild sauce was still very spicy to me. I love garlic but there was A LOT of chunks of garlic. Some were very hot and bitter tasting. I think a garlic paste or puree would add better in butter. The sauce was VERY salty. I could not taste crab or shrimp because the sauce was overpowering. I asked for a side of butter to try and dilute the spice and saltiness of sauce to no avail.   The shrimp was a bit mushy (old)? I only received 1 corn in my bag so London took the other one off of our bill.  Cajun fries were super spicy. I couldn't eat them. Calamari was ok. Corona was nice and cold.  I had a difficult time using the tools they provided. I'm going to bring my own cooking scissors next time to open crab.   Overall service was excellent. London was very attentive.  I would try this place again but I would order snow crab and shrimp in just plain butter with light garlic, no spice, corn & potato. If I go again, I'll leave an updated review.",

    "text": "You know how Southern California loves their Crawfish/Shrimp boil spots, so we had to try what Vegas had to offer. (8/30/19)  There's two locations fairly near one another. We stopped by one in a crowded strip with an abundance of different restaurants, so finding parking at 9PM in 90 degree weather was tough.   However once we got to our destination it was fine. It seemed busy, which was good sign for good food, right?! We waited for a few minutes to be seated since we had a party of 6. Once seated we were offered water right away.   Our server Randy was very friendly and informative, somehow he knew it was our first time. We decided to do an ala carte instead of trying a combo meal (which we usually do when its our first time). We got 3lbs of crawfish, 2lbs. of shrimp, 1lb of black mussels, 1lb of green mussels, dozen oysters, sweet potato fries and cajun fries. The flavor we tried was their signature \"Hot & Juicy\" mild.   So I don't like crawfish due to several bad experiences, but my friends convinced me to try it. I usually get crawfish that taste like dirt and even some gritty textures. But this one was sweet and clean! Great quality I suppose, c'mon California, clean your crawfish or maybe I just haven't visited the right spots. If you have any suggestions, let me know.   The oysters were small, first time I've tried them, clean and fresh. I also tried black mussels for the first time. Smaller in size compared to the \"Green New Zealand\" mussels. It was also tender and sweet in comparison to a more chewy texture with the green mussels. There was enough of their signature sauce to enjoy every bite. The shrimps were a good size and boiled just right, not rubbery.. My daughter loves crab, so we had to get the snow crab legs. These were bigger than I've had. Easy to open and lots of meat. My daughter loved them - she ate all 2lbs of it all by herself and she wanted more. Sweet potato & Cajun Fries were similar to what I've had at other places, nothing spectacular but almost a must for me when I'm eating at a boil. I usually don't have rice with this, but the sauce was so good and \"a little more spicy\" than what I'm used to that I had to finish off the sauce.   In the end, I added a  little spice to my life. Besides the horrible parking, it was a great place to try and if I'm back in town, I'll definitely come back and get a 1lb of crawfish just for me!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for months and finally went with my coworkers on a little outing. Both of the spring mountain locations are very busy. We were told it would be about a 15 minute wait but it was really around 25. Once we finally sat down we the service was pretty good, not great but also not bad.   I ordered the snow crab legs and clams with 2 corn & 2 potatoes. I got the hot n juicy sauce (I learned it is all of the sauces mixed together) and for spice level I got medium. I was a little scared because I don't really like lemon pepper but I couldn't taste it and it was more garlicky and spicy which I enjoyed a lot! Also, medium is spicier than I expected but in a good way. If you aren't big into spice I would recommend going down a level from there. A lot of my clams were empty so that was a bummer because I don't feel like I got my pound worth. But the crab was plentiful and full of meat. I wish they cut the potatoes up a little to make it easier to eat but no big deal.   I'm not giving 5 stars because they brought out our food completely random. So we were waiting for everyone to get their food before eating and the time between the first person getting their food and the last person getting theirs was like  10-15 minutes which is kind of ridiculous. One of the people we were with ordered calamari which they had to have forgotten about because she said it always comes out first normally and she eats here a lot and it was the absolute last thing to come out and we had to remind them twice. Also we had 5 people and they only brought us utensils for 3 people and never brought more. Overall I will definitely go again, the flavors were really good and there are some more things I want to try.",

I don't mind having to go through the mess to eat snow crab legs because the flavor of seafood is best with the shell intact. That's also True for fish so I like a fish served whole when possible.   There are about 3-4 of these places in Vegas. Their beers go best with the seafood and I'm glad they offered plenty of gloves, bibs, and napkins. The waitress did forget about the utensils but service was great otherwise.   Their dinner selections were awesome offerings of combinations of crawfish shrimp and crab legs with sides and sausages. Their sauces were delicious whether you just like garlic and butter or the zestiest spiciest Juicy was delicious too. I was so full there was no room for dessert that evening.",

We ordered mussels, king crab legs, shrimp and crawfish - all hot n juicy mix mild spice. The flavor was lacking throughout, perhaps because we chose mild spice? Either way not enough flavor. We ordered a side of corn and potatoes and that bag came out super tasty!!! So I'm not sure what happened with the actual seafood. We ordered corn fritters as an appetizer, those were very yummy as well!  And another downside: the crawfish were very tiny =/ they hardly had any meat on them and were not worth the order or price. This was a disappointment since it's in the name of the place.  The service was good and we were greeted with carnations for Mother's Day which was a nice touch.",

    "text": "This was my first time at a Hot N Juicy, and the only other experience I've had at this kind of establishment had been at Boiling Crab. Many people say that they prefer this chain over the other, and I can't say I agree or disagree, as they both have their own special something that keeps customers coming back.   I ordered half a pound of shrimp, with a corn and potato inside, with their equivalent of a whole shabang, at mild spice, which the waitress rated an 8/10. As a lover of spicy foods, I was shocked to find out I couldn't handle their mild spice level, it was some seriously spicy stuff, and even my friends who are used to eating super spicy things agreed. However it was good and flavorful, and didn't leave your mouth a burning, deserted wasteland.   They also serve chicken wings and sandwiches if you're not into seafood, and have a pretty expansive menu. Our waitress was friendly and went out of her way to answer all our questions, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering how busy it was.   The only reason I give this place a 4/5 is that the wait times are extremely long and the area it is located in has extremely limited parking. My friends and I came at around 4pm to avoid the dinner time rush and still there was an 1.5hr wait. It seems like a very popular establishment so definitely plan ahead or be prepared to wait. As for the parking, it is located in a very busy shopping/food center, so sometimes there is not a parking space available either.",

We ordered two pounds of shrimp and two pounds of crawfish, the shrimp was good but way too spicy and way too salty. The frozen crawfish barely had any meat. Our rice came wayyyyyyyyyy after our main food and our bread that we needed to eat with the spicy food did not come until a hour later after our food. It was store bought Hawaiian roles...

    "text": "I used to love coming here! Not so much lately. Came here due to a special request from my mom who was visiting in town, so decided to try and order pick up.  Attempting to call. Back then, used to not be so difficult to place a pick up order. I guess from the hours of 12-1pm, their phones are left off the hook. Busy tone at either of the locations on spring mountain. Tried again at 115 pm, when I was almost close to this location, and was put on hold. After about 15 minutes of being on hold I reached the location and just walked in. Seemed like they forgot about my call since a couple of people were just standing behind the bar and the other two cleaning. I know who answered the phone because she did the same thing with another person who called, put them on hold and walked away from it.  Luckily the two guys working, chao (Asian guy might've misspelled his name) and the guy cleaning, checked on me when I walked in. The dude cleaning pointed me to the service bar where I could place my order and that's when the Asian guy helped me.  He stopped what he was doing and helped out. Got my order down in less than 2 minutes. Awesome. Thank you so much! Sat down and waited.  A few more minutes later, got my food and was on my way home.  Taste of the food. Not as tasty as before but did the trick. Got two pounds of crawfish (so I could get the potato and corn) and one pound shrimp, hot and juicy, medium.  Needed rice as it was spicier than I thought, but a good spicy.  For me, hot and juicy takes the cake for flavor out of all the crawfish places, so the customer service didn't really deter me from coming here. But just be warned, it's a hit or miss on service now a days on these locations on spring mountain.",

Traditionally we try to wait until everyone has their food to dig in but we weren't able to because of the fear of cold food.   I love love love spicy food, but this time I only ordered the medium. Their medium is equivalent to what Nashville Hot is back home. Out of the crab legs, shrimp, and catfish ordered the catfish basket seemed to be the best tasting. I did like the gloves and bib that they provide you because it did get messy!",

Good news - I am heading to Vegas in a week (well good news for me and bad news for shellfish)!  This place is located in a predominantly Asian part of town in a strip mall and has a certain amount of sketchy feel to it -that makes it taste better.  You sit down and basically choose what type of shell fish you want - crab, shrimp, clams, or, of course, crawfish.  Then you choose the sauce.  I can't more highly recommend their special sauce.  Finally, you choose spice level.  Let me first say that I eat ghost pepper spice all the time - i.e. I LOVE HEAT.  However, I would recommend no hotter than medium.  Not necessarily because it is too spicy, but because of the level of garlic and oil -this  is a stomach explosion waiting to happen.  Seriously, I love this place....LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!",

Their special sauce tastes more garlicky and savory to me. Be warned that they make things SPICY, just the way I like it! If you can't handle too much spice, ask for the baby spice level. Their mild is already a 5-6 on a 10 point scale. I usually order the Cajun fries, corn or rice to soak up that delicious sauce. Consider saving this for the end of your trip. I know you're clubbing tonight and hot garlic breath for days is not going to help your game.",

I visited the original place in LV a while back and thought the place was decent. Well, this location gives the whole concept a nice face lift with a spacious and casual dining room and a cool-looking bar you can seat at if you are by yourself. Being a saucy peel-and-eat seafood place, please expect a messy experience...and table, and hands, bib, etc. This is a unique eating experience to be shared with friends over a few beers, as long as everyone at the table is willing to work a bit for their food (peeling can be tedious).  I ordered the lemon pepper shrimp with no oil (I was actually impressed the cooks prepared my order fat-free) and my girl ordered the butter garlic crawfish. The seasoning was very good but a bit spicy, specially if you are not into spicy foods at all. My pound of shrimp was very flavorful and each shrimp was plump and perfectly cooked. On the other hand, the pound of crawfish was awful- tiny crawfish with little or no meat in them...A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I cannot say this enough...JUST GET THE SHRIMP!  Important tips: * Be ready for a messy experience. If you do not like eating with your hands and perhaps getting splashed with shrimp sauce, this place is not for you.  * Get the shrimp and not the crawfish. Also, get two pounds of it if you are hungry.  * They charge 60 cents for a tiny potato! You are better off getting some rice on the side.  * Expect to spend about $15 per person.  * Even no spicy IS a bit spicy.",

Plastic utensils and no plates and paper towel rolls.  Can't be ashamed of leaving carcasses on the table.  Reasonable prices.   Don't bring your friends that can't handle seeing the heads of seafood. Although my favorite part someone at another table couldn't handle it and their whole party left cause of him. Such a shame.   They do have chicken fingers for the non-seafood eaters.  We ordered Calamari Raw oysters Shrimp mild with hot and juicy sauce Shrimp mild with garlic butter Lobster with garlic butter Crawfish medium hot and spicy Fried Catfish Sweet potatoe fries  Everything was incredible. Oysters were good but nothing special. Wish I didn't order rice as that's what put me over the top but couldn't help it I'm Chinese and the sauce over rice is oh so good!  Import beers for $3 - Domestic $2. Just Beer - no wine or alcohol.  Wish they had at least wine as not so filling as beer.  Restaurant closer to Valley View is much larger and not as busy.  Parking can be difficult as there's a bunch of other popular restaurants sharing the same parking lot.",

Lol. We had a party of 4 and ordred 3 pounds of shrimp, hot, spicy and mild with butter. I probably ate most of the mild with buttershrimp because I love butter with my seafood. My boyfriend, his brother and his cousin mostly ate the hot and spicy shrimp. I tried the hot and spicy shrimp; it wasn't that hot, but I think the aftertaste got me. Haha. We also got side orders of rice just to keep the spicyness to a level. The corn in the bag was also amazing to its taste! I've never ate such a juicy corn smuthered in mild sauce before. By the time the bag was almost gone, I was really full. Good stuff!",

I ordered the hot n juicy special and it was really good. They hand you a plastic bag with your food and you chow down. I got the shrimp and I like the fact that you can order how many pounds you wanted. I would definetly recommend this to anyone that loves sea food and doesn't mind eating with their hand and getting messy.",

I ordered 2lbs of the spicy garlic butter and calimari. My friend ordered the 4lbs of extra spicy lousiana style which he shared with his gf. The spicy garlic butter was amazing, it was not too spicy and not too garlicy flavored. The extra spicy was really spicy but still enjoyable. My friend mentioned that the garlic butter he had in the DC location had too much garlic that it was not too appetizing.  When I pointed out that the owner was there, we mentioned it to him and he was really cool about and appreciated our feed back. Hope the cooks in DC gets more training because I look forward in eating at that location.",

I did not feel comfortable there and felt a bit claustrophobic. I recommend for you to go down the road to the 4810 Spring Mountain Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89102 location. Much better service over there!",

    "text": "I really wanted to have a whole crab so I rolled into this place. They did deliver a fresh dungeness crab; although, at a price. A price you wouldn't know if you didn't think to ask up front.  Now, apparently according to some folks, if you see a price for crab or lobster on a board you assume it's per pound. Sure, maybe I've been living under a rock but if I see a price next to dungeness crab and there isn't \"/lb\" or \"per pound\" next to it, I'm going to think it's the price of the crab.  If you look at the menu it says \"market price\" but I've never read anything in economics advising that the unit of measure is always by pound.   I've ordered seafood at many places, fish markets, casual and fine dining, from across the country and I have never been uncertain about what I was going to pay at the end. For example, at R & D in Newport Beach, they list fish as \"market price\" but the server will tell you exactly what the whole plate will cost.  Now, I can't say what would've happened if I had known it was per pound and asked the server how much it's going to weigh, but it's a nasty surprise to somebody who didn't know how \"these places\" work. Nobody should have to make this mistake just to find out. Would it be that difficult to add per pound to the board or menu?  I can't recommend you eat here at Hot N Juicy Crawfish because if you aren't certain about how much you're going to get or what you're going to pay for it, it's not fair.",

    "text": "Seafood cooked in a bag of the juicy goodness of your choice. I've been here so many times, I don't know why I haven't written a review. It may be because everyone knows this place and it's already popular...  But here is basically what you need to know: -you, and everything else you bring into the restaurant (purse, clothes, shoes, etc), will REEK of garlic for several days following. But it's all worth it. -you can/will get dirty. There's a reason why they cover the tables with plastic and paper. You deconstruct your food and throw the remains right on the table. They do provide bibs and plastic gloves upon request. -seafood remains intact, heads and all. So if you're squeamish about seeing the head still attached to your shrimp friend, then you probably shouldn't eat here. -there are 2 locations: both on Spring Mountain, one near Decatur and the other near Valley View.  And one more thing: I will go out on a limb and say it. I prefer Hot N Juicy Crawfish over Boiling Crab. The Hot N Juicy special vs Boiling Crab's version...I just like the flavors better.",

    "text": "After seeing a special with Hot N Juicy Crawfish Las Vegas on the Food Network, I had to give this place a try when we were in town last week.  The hubby loves seafood and I'm not much of a fan but this place definitely made me think differently.  We had lunch here since it was less busy than dinner time and were so glad we had a chance to try out the food.  Everything is pretty much steamed and then tossed in thick clear plastic bags to absorb whatever sauces you choose.  They also give you gloves and bibs because it does get messy, but that is where everything tastes so much better.  We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell, 2 lbs of Dungeness crab, 2 lbs of frozen  crawdads (they didn't have any fresh ones flown in that day), and 1 lb of shrimp.  We had them all tossed in the famous Hot n Juicy sauce (which is a combination of all their flavors they have) with a spice level of Spicy.  Man, it had major kick and made all the seafood taste so much better.  The hubby was surprised to see me for the very first time actually sucking on all the sauce juices from the seafood, normally I just peel away and eat the meat.  It is definitely two things that make this place well known:  the freshness and simplicity of their seafood choices, and the killer sauces everything is tossed in.  Staff were all very friendly (especially our waitress Polina) , always stopping in to make sure everything was okay.  Definitely recommend this place if you are a seafood fan.  We will return next time we are in Vegas.",

But I am now obsessed with oysters and I love love love their seasoning choices. We got the hot n spicy everything but I loved it and can't wait to try more! The king crab legs were huge and full of meat! The shrimp and oysters were our fav! Didn't do the crawfish as I find them pointless cause there's little to no meat. The others I was with got some fried fish basket things, I'm not big on fried seafood so I didn't try it but they loved that as well. Service seemed friendly and prompt. Can't wait to go back!

    "text": "Paid $40 for a Dungeness crab that provided maybe a quarter oz of actual, edible food. When I showed the waitress, she insisted on it being the fault of the way I disassembled the crab, which would've perhaps aided in yielding another 1/8 oz of crab meat if done correctly. Mind you, this was in addition to another $100 worth of lobster, shrimp and appz, all of which were delicious.  I'm not a fatty, I just like to splurge when the situation arises. If the young lady serving us would've even offered to comp me a house salad for feeling just a tad dissatisfied, I would've tipped her $100 instead of the $30 I left instead, which even my date still considered generous. I wrote this on the receipt though I'm sure the girl was happy to receive a tip at all regardless.  Cook it at home. You'll impress her more and save yourself the money and hassle of being underserved by a barage of young waitresses who could really care less about seeing you off happy.   LG",

I had ordered a side of the hot n juicy special sauce to go with my rice, the sauce is good but waaay too oily.

When we went there this Saturday noon, there was luckily not a wait.   The employees here were very accomodating. Kudos to their excellent service. Also, the food was great. I think the shrimp was actually the best thing I had here. I also had crawfish, etoufee, and clams. We got the Hot N Juicy Crawfish spice mix and everything was about medium spiciness.   Even their bibs were of premium quality, although the question of the day is, why is there a lobster on the bib? Isn't it a crawfish place?",

I'm in a wheelchair so I got prime parking. =P    Went with a buddy who I havent seen since high school , his fiance and kid. Greeted warmly by the hostess and seated promptly .... This place gets packed fast so do what we did and arrive at 6pm or earlier. We went on saturday 07/02/11 a holiday weekend. All the waitresses were as the restaurant name says \"Hot n Juicy\" looking!! Not too shabby !!   we ordered ....  1 Catfish Tray  2 pounds crawfish 1 chicken tray 1 clams  2 orders of rice 1 etouffe 1 pound garlic butter shrimp  The Catfish was awesome ..... Lightly Breaded on top of a bed of fries.... Didnt have the fries coz I'm trying to watch my Girly Figure.... =P  I had the crawfish Louisiana style w mild spices..... Simply delicious!  Albert ( my buddy from high school ) had the etouffe and a crawfish medium spice in garlic butter.  I'm a Crawfish rookie ....loved the flavor ....didnt like the tiny reward for breaking open those lil bastards! Took a bite of the garlic butter shrimp and know what I'm ordering the Next time I come here!!  Just like a previous reviewer said  \"You know this place is bangin' when you're nose is drippin and you don't even know it.\" I was told by Lorena ( my buddies fiance) that I was sweating on my head..... I seriously didnt realize it!! The food is THAT GOOD!!  Definitely coming back for another round!! Great Place!!  OH!! I forgot to mention that our waitress brought us a bill from another table for only 20.00 ........ rather than a bill for 80.00 which it should be.... This was one of those What Would you Do kind of moments.... Just pay 20.00 ? or bring it to our waitresses attention..... We decided to bring it to our waitresses attention and she was so appreciative of that !! I would'nt feel right paying 20.00 for what we ate AND I would feel guilty knowing that the waitress would have to take a cut from her check for her error..... DO WHATS RIGHT PEOPLE!!  Do whats right!! nuff said.....",

My advice.. get something that's not garlicky =P but i think that would be tough..   Enjoy your crawfish! I know i i enjoyed all of it!!!",

No wait and food came out in about 10 minutes or less.  Service was adequate but the food was just so so.  Ordered a lb of shrimp and an lb of crawfish, medium spice level.  We used to love this place but not so much anymore.  Don't get me wrong, it's far from bad but maybe we just got used to the Boiling Crab's seasoning.  It's slightly different and we found H&J's to be slightly more spiced/gritty.  Overall was ok, but just prefer Boiling Crab more.",

    "text": "I told one of my coworkers about a new business that is having a grand opening today, and to meet us there after work.  I didn't know the exact address, so I told him to just search for the Hot N Juicy by name and go to the one closest to the Wynn.  He immediately thought I was trying to steer him to some other type of establishments hidden in plain sight throughout Las Vegas.  At Hot N Juicy, where the girls on average are pretty, the service is very friendly and attentive, Hot n Juicy Special is always on the menu, individual experiences can be customized from Mild to Extra Spicy, you can definitely treat your mouth to a messy but happy ending.  And today only, you can enjoy it with a 2-for-1 special*.  Come early and expect to wait at least 40 minutes, or take up the offer of a free limo shuttle service to Hot n Juicy (original location) where the food is the same, but without the wait and the services of the Hot N Juicy All-Star waitresses.  Again, the limo is presumably for the Grand Opening promotion only.  Spicy level is supposedly a little higher than other places, so customize accordingly.  1 pound of crawfish may sound like a lot, but it really is not, as most of the weight is contributed by the lobster-mini-me shells.  If crawfish is not your thing, shrimp, lobster, clams, and various crabs (Dungeness, Blue, Snow and King), and raw oysters can be ordered.  You can add the following sides to your above orders: Corn, potato, sausage, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, bowl of rice, rolls and even extra seasoning sauce.  Appetizers include Fried Shrimp, Fried Catfish, Soft Shell Crab, Calamari, Chicken Wings and Etouffee.  What I like about this place?  \"It is bigger on the inside\".  The waitresses remind me of Suicide Girls.  Perfect place to visit to satisfy your spicy food craving. In case there is a wait for the use of the restrooms or you have a tendency to stare at the waitresses, you have portraits of the lovely Hot N Juicy Girls to check out.  Or you can just pretend there is a line for the lavatory.  What I don't like or care for:  Shrimp are not de-veined.  The parking here can be a pain, as it can be rather scarce during peak hours.  Not to mention some less than proficient drivers to deal with.  Overall, I enjoyed my Hot N Juicy dining experience.  The food was pretty good, but dining here is more of a social activity for me. And if you have a problem with eating with your hands and getting messy, it is best to patronize a different establishment, otherwise enjoy!  Ambiance:  4/5  Roomy, with fishing theme decor adorning the walls and pictures of the Hot N Juicy waitresses on the hallway wall leading to the restrooms. Cleanliness:  5/5  It is new, but I hope they keep it looking that way. Food:  4/5  Nothing extraordinary, but it is enjoyable and fun. Price: 3/5  About what you expect.  The main items are all priced at \"Market or Seasonal Price\", which for shrimp and crawfish are around the $10 mark. Location:  4/5  Definitely close enough to the Strip for the out-of-towners to take a cab here.  Pretty solid 4 Yelp stars.  *Buy 1 pound of crawfish get the 2nd pound free, all day until it is sold out.",

We get seated and our server asks us what we would like to drink. I order a Blue Moon and she tells me they don't have their alcohol permit yet. WTF?!!  What we ordered:  2 Calamari 1 Fried Catfish Basket 2 lbs Shrimp Hot N Juicy medium 1 lb Shrimp Garlic Butter mild 1 Chicken Nuggets Basket 2 Chicken Wings Basket 1 Fried Shrimp 4 Bowls of Rice  The food was just as good as the original location. This is the first time I tried the Catfish and Calamari and they were both very good.   My only other complaint is that the chicken wings for the kids took a long time and were brought out a few minutes apart. They should have just brought out the orders together, cause one kid had to watch the other kid eat.   I will mos def come back to this location since there is no wait to be seated. Next time I will call first to make sure they have their alcohol permit.",

So the following day we want here to eat before leaving Vegas.  We came in a little after they opened, it wasn't too busy. Probably 7 other parties but more came later. Hostess sat us in a booth and the server came not too long after.   Since this place is very similar to boiling crab I ordered what I always order. I ordered a pound of shrimp, i got it hot n juicy medium and cajun fries. I got my fries first, they were tasty but I kind of expected it to be more spicy, but that's ok it definitely helped satisfy my craving for cajun fries. Then my shrimp arrived, I opened it up and dived right in and my goodness this sauce was so damn good! It definitely did not disappoint me! I wish I ordered a pound and a half. I also had a bowl of rice with this and by the time I was done I was completely stuffed. I'll be sure to come back here next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "The name of this place is funny, their food is tasty and if you dine in you'll reek of garlic :-)   We came to this Hot N Juicy Crawfish based on a Yelp search in China Town.  They have a lot of high rated reviews by locals and it was something different from where we usually when in Vegas.     Restaurant~ This place is busy with loads of people wearing plastic bibs and gloves eating bags of garlic immersed cooked crustaceans.  It's very open with plenty of seating for small or large groups of peeps.  One of the first things you notice when you walk in is the BLAST of garlic odor.  I normally love the smell of garlic, but this was too intense for me.    Service~ like a lot of places anymore! some of the people that work here are really friendly and seem very helpful and then there are a few that were not helpful at all and seem to treat us like number takers...  Maybe it's because they are so busy, but that's just an excuse.  I could care less man vs food dined here, which is what two of the servers told us and it's on their menu.  I'm looking for quality of taste and not quantity of food to conquer.    Food~ we had shrimp, clams and crawfish cooked in their juicy sauce which was very good but loads and loads of garlic...    This is an A-OK place especially if you're planning to do take out!  I recommend going when the crawfish are in season, order to go and share the good eats with some friends.",

The whole shebang at bc is definitely better/more garlicky than the hnj. Crawfish at BC was much much better than here. The shrimp is about the same. Mussels were just ok here, sausage was kinda dry, the crab was pretty good. Their louisana sauce was pretty watery but my friend liked it. The fresh oysters were also pretty good.  service - really inattentive. We had to ask multiple times for things like water, missing sides, and to clean up a huge pile of plates we stacked up to be cleared for our second round of ordering.

Upon entering, the first thing you notice are the used paper towels littering the floors and coming out of the trash receptacles that haven't been emptied. My date, who'd been their before, said wait til you taste the food. Ooh la la. We sat down and ordered. I had mudbugs(crawfish) because I'd never had them before. They came with new potatoes and corn on the cob. The place just wasn't working it's magic(maybe mojo took the day off) and asked that the food be bagged so we could get out of their as soon as possible. I think I hurt my dates feelings, because she took a cab home. If I'd known how bad crawfish tasted I would have given her mine as well. So, on the way home I tried me a mudbug. It was awful. All they are are the brains(don't eat the green stuff) and a smidgen of meat in the tail. Not enough nutrition in a dozen to keep a bird alive. So, for almost $40 fazoles, I got a bagful off new taters and corn on the cobs.(And my dates bagfuls as well). When I got home I put the bugs in Ralph's dish(my bloodhound), and he came to the same conclusion I did. The End I wouldn't go back to this place even if they fed me for free. It deserves negative stars, but they're not available.",

The corn was the best I have ever had. Simple menu and great interior space. Really nothing I could complain about...definitely deserves the high reviews it has. Can't wait to go back!",

I swirled my car in to the first space about a quarter mile up and heaved a sigh of relief. We hiked down and it did not take more than 15 minutes to be escorted to our table. I love the look of the ceiling and light fixtures and really appreciated seating that does not put my elbows on the next couple's table. Already big stars for this great space. No kidding- I had to look at the ceiling because the tables were hotbeds of orange spice colored plastic gloves, worn by immaculately dressed women and men fishing into huge bags of colorful crawfish and shrimp. It was like a movie about starvation but you had to wear gloves. Little kids and parents were chowing down on the table's contents, happy as clams, no pun intended. My husband had whispered \"Crawfish\" all the way here. I suggested he get the 2 pound bag of crawfish because there would be spiced corn and a potato in the bag to fill him up. Meanwhile I ordered the catfish basket with sweet potato fries and a Sapporo. Hot, delicious and non-messy....  Back to his side of our table-- the man with the hot spicy crawfish pulled tiny bits of fish from the shells and exclaimed that now he needed a meal to fill him up! We laughed! Seriously? This former auto body repairman who had his bleeding hands tied up with duct tape and bandages to finish a job says \"This was too much work.\" We both want to come back for Dungeness crab, oysters and shrimp. Great experience- good food and attentive, helpful staff. Next time if you come- take a shuttle or bus or even walk- the parking lot is scary as hell after 5. Ps he walked not far away and honestly- he ate a crepe filled with strawberries and covered with whipped cream and chocolate. (My catfish basket did not require any embellishment or crepes.) You can bet we jogged in our pool under the Supermoon last night to work off the meals!!",

Yes it's hot & juicy for sure, and yes it makes sense to wear the traditional crab eating bib and to use the gloves, but I damn, I don't know, I would have preferred a bowl, or a plate.   And definitely use the gloves, but your hands will still smell for a day or so!  The grab & mussels were good. The corn fritters were amazing!",

The garlic taste is there, but the popular \"Hot N Juicy\" seasoning just didn't have the kick I was hoping for.    Here's what I ordered:  Sausages: just ok Shrimp: pretty good Clams: pretty good Corn: wow, lots of spices Cajun fries: delicious Chicken wings: pretty good!  One thing I do like: they offer gloves for people who do not like to get their hands dirty (i.e. my husband). I personally think that getting your hands dirty is part of the experience. They also have lobster!!!  But I think I'll just wait to go to Orange County for my Cajun fix.",

Of course be prepared for horrible customer service. Outside of being sat right away we didnt see our servers but once every 30 mins and that was because we stood up and waved one down when our drinks were empty.  After our meal was done it was another 10 mins before our bill came and we had to ask for it twice.  This store is laid out better and you dont feel like you are sitting on top of the people next to you.  The food is still top notch. Gloriously spicy and delicious. Almost perfect...I say almost only because they dont serve something to cool you down afterwards. A simple soft serve ice cream machine with one or two flavors would make this a perfect dinning experience but 98.5% is good enough for me!",

I can eat H&J all day errday!!!  Every time I go to H&J i request to be seated in Molly's section. She is so amazing and HOT! She is very attentive, especially with the drinks.

I will say it's a hit or miss, great concept people love it but there's an art to steaming seafood in plastic bags with juices, they tend to keep cooking long after they've been removed from the steamer especially since they keep the bag tied.  When sitting in the back and when they bring it out to you.  That extra time cooking in its own juices tends to overcook the food, I ordered blue crab for 11.99 a pound that gets you 2 little crabs which is ridiculous they were totally mushy,snow crabs 18.99 a pound that gets you 1 cluster, I got a half pound shrimp which they serve with the heads on which makes them heavier they were borderline overcooked, I also paid $2 and change for a half dozen of sausages I received one sausage cut in 6 pieces lmfao the pieces were still attached. Meal cost me $51 for mushy food, it's not the first time I've experienced this but it most certainly will be the last.",

Our order came out and soon after that, an order of rice was put on our table.. but none of us ordered rice? It turned out that it was their mistake so they gave us the rice portion free of charge. Granted that rice doesn't cost much, but hoorah for friendly service. The shrimp were large in size and the sauce was good. Not too salty or heavy and perfect in flavor. All three of us decided that this was better than Boiling Crab. Definitely worth the 15$ taxi ride there and back to the strip.",

We ordered the crawfish but they were out of the red (wasn't too fond of the crawfish they substituted it with) don't order it if they're out of red crawfish. The sauce was good but it could save the taste of the crawfish. We also had the shrimp in the house spice I believe. I loved it! The shrimp was huge, not soggy and flavorful! The lobster was great also! Huge lobster and a lot of sauce! The service was okay, but the food made up for everything!",

Her name on the receipt is Nikki and she was helpful.   We walked in to order to go and spent about $70. Once we paid, we were asked to sit in the front to wait for our food so we patiently did. I've ordered here lots of times and i know that there's a bit of a wait to get our food.  I noticed that there's a person that came in after me that got his order first but thought maybe he called it in and picked it up but he still waited.  However, 30 minutes is way too long. So I was approaching the back area to see if my order is ready but another waitress was on her way towards me so I asked her if she can check the status of my order.  She rudely said \"well, you can just go to the back to check yourself\".  I understand that this place is very busy but there's a way to speak to customers.  I was annoyed but decided to go and check on my long overdue food in the back register and they were all busy so I waited again for a few minutes and the same young lady that rudely told me to go in the back approaches my area and asked me with a HEAVY breath \"the name on the order?\" So I released the name and she reaches behind her with my food just sitting there. I asked her if it's been sitting there and she had the audacity to feel around the plastic bag and says to me \"well, it's still hot so NO\".   I'm glad that the same girl that rang us up told her that she will help us instead and she finished it up.",

You just wouldn't expect such a great atmosphere from the restaurant's curb appeal.   Furthermore, the other thing that surprised me was that we got plastic bags full of piping hot seafood equipped with plastic gloves and a bib. The experience is raw and very satisfying.   We did the shrimp and catfish. The shrimp was great and they came to us fully intact  (heads and all). As a Cajun I know all about peeling off the heads and eating the delicious meat. Loved the experience.  The catfish was not good. It came deep fried like it had used grease saved from years past. The insides (meat) was greasy too. Just don't get it.  Go here if you want great seafood in a raw manner.",

    "text": "Ever since watching the Man v. Food episode featuring Hot N Juicy, I've wanted to try it out. I'm a big fan of Boiling Crab in LA, but I wanted to try HNJ as well. I wasn't sure which was the original location, but I went to the Valley View location because it was on the way to my next destination. I don't think it matters too much. You get the same recipe and it's a matter of cooking or steaming the food correctly.   We ordered 2 lbs of snow crabs, 1 lb of jumbo shrimp (both Hot N Juicy seasoning-medium), and 1 lb of clams (garlic butter-baby spice). A little pricey at a hair under $75, but well worth it. Sauce was robust in flavor and very spicy! The medium left my mouth burning and the baby spice even had a kick. My guess is that the HNJ seasoning is a mix of cajun and garlic.The shrimp and clams were very large and meaty.   We did take out (and a good thing because I was sweating so much). The added bonus is that we had a pot of cooked rice on standby. With it being so spicy, I needed to cool off by eating some bland rice. However, there's so much extra sauce (it's MESSY) and I got to enjoy the flavors with my bowl of rice. It's a great compliment to the rice.",

Born and raise in Houston, TX, my tongue can definitely tell the difference between the two. In which I received about a handful that were deliciously fresh and the rest were frozen.

There was a 30 minute wait so we went next door and all got 30 minute massages lol(awesome). So we come back and get seated at our table.  Waitress was super sweet and attentive  Took our order,  put on those garbage bag bibs lol, and gloves.  Food came out and man it was hott, like spicy hot.  Which is great but i had a runny nose after the first 2 bites but I didn't mind lol just caught me off guard.  All the food was just below great. The cajun fries were way to oily for my liking. The cajun calamari was good, but portion was small, the softshell crab was surprisingly good even thou I am not a fan of crab.  Overall I'd enjoyed the experience with cause of my great friends, great service,  good food, and a break from the strip.  I think the most fascinating part of this experience was looking around at how everyone sat there with tables packed with food and then nothing was left. So it's definitely an experience I'd recommed",

Our wait wasn't too long for a party of 9.  We waited for about 20 minutes to be seated then another 25 minutes or so for our food.  They were extremely busy but I'm glad that our server didn't forget us and made sure our food came out in a timely manner.   We had complimentary tasting of the which was really nice of them.  That held us over until our food arrived.  I was hungry.   Service:  Very nice and always came by to check up on us.   Food:  TIP: Pick a seasoning, Spice Level and your choice of craving. Ask for gloves Lime if you don't want to use gloves to kill the seafood smell on your fingers.  Overall, the food was really good and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.",

There's a place in Rowland Heights, CA, called King Crawfish and I almost always have to have sausages added because it's delicious. Here, their shrimp was the highlight.

    "text": "This place is the real deal. Im from New Orleans currently living in Colorado so I complain about seafood whenever I get the chance. Saw Hot n Juicy on Man Vs. Food and wanted to try it. The crawfish are cooked perfectly and did in fact taste as though they were flown in from Louisiana every morning. I asked the server which part but he didn't know.       The spices I tried were the traditional Louisiana and the Hot n Juicy special, both with medium spice. They were both excellent. The traditional is very similar to the crawfish boils I use to have in the backyard with my family. I initially got two pounds but then got another two pounds after that. At 10 bucks a pound, be prepared to spend about $60.00 for two people.      We also tried the sausage and sweet potatoe fries, again both were great. The fries were made to order and the sausage was very flavorful. My only complaint is that the potato that the comes with the crawfish (if you order two pounds) is very plain. It tasted like they boiled it by itself and then just threw it in with the crawfish. But anyone from New Orleans knows that the potatoes must be boiled with the crawfish and have the potential to be the most flavorful piece of food in the boil. My wife was also disappointed with the corn on the cob that was included, she stated that it tasted like it was just a cheap frozen corn. Im definitely going to revisit when I goto Las Vegas again.",

I sit waiting almost an hour before a waitress sits down next to me; \"We forgot to put your order in. Its going to take another 15-20 minutes and you'll be put in the system for a free meal the next time you order.\" I sat for another 20 minutes and asked for my refund of the money already paid. The cashier began to hesitate like she didn't know what to do. Eventually as they were refunding my money the food came from underneath the counter; not the window where everyone else's food came from. I think this establishment needs a bit more customer service and less texting from their employees.",

Even though crawfish is in their name, to get the most bang for your bucks stick with shrimps and crabs as they have more meat whereas the crawfish is mostly shell.  The fried catfish was excellent & the french fries' portion was large and a good foil for the spicy sauce they boil their shellfish in.",

You have to peel the crawdads and shrimp, which is fine, more flavor up in there that way, but it's so overcooked the meat turns to mush and your fingers will stink of farm-raised crawfish from god-knows-what southeast asian cesspool and garlic for days.  Bleccch.  Don't know why I went back.",

    "text": "This was my second experience with this restaurant.   The food was OK, but the service was just awful.   I can live with a place that is really low-brow in presentation.  No plates.  No spoons.  Paper cups. Food served in plastic bags served on a plastic table cloth.  No utensils were offered at all.  I had a few pounds of HotNJuicy crayfish that tasted pretty good, but were swimming in enough garlic to choke a small country.  Not that there's anything wrong with garlic.   Back to the utensils.  OK I get it.  Crayfish is something you eat with our fingers, but I'm supposed to eat boiled potatoes with my fingers?  That's too much to ask.   I'd also like to get offered the option of some sort of condiment with the crayfish.  Some cocktail sauce or melted butter would have been really nice, but despite having at least 6 waitresses in the place they barely spoke to us at all.  They just kept walking past us over and over helping other tables.  It was seriously incompetent wait service.  The person who took our order never really came back to ask us if we needed anything at all and we had to waive down somebody to bring a check and then we waited at least 10 minutes for change.    The highlight of the meal was the soft shell crab basket.  The fries were perfectly cooked and the crab was plentiful and tasty.  Well done and a descent deal at around $11.  The $11 per pound price on the crayfish was high considering that there was not really a ton of food in a whole bag full.   At the end of the meal I started noticing everyone else had a bowl of lemons and what looked like a finger bowl.  We never got and because nobody was paying any attention to us at all it was a problem,  This is really messy stuff to eat.  Your fingers get caked up with garlic and spices and paper towels simply do not handle it.  When we asked for something to wash out hands we were instructed to go to the restroom - which was actually quite nasty inside.  Dark.  Dirty.  Pretty gross actually.  All I needed was a descent wet wipe like the kind most restaurants that serve messy food offer you.  Better than that would have been a finger bowl of lemon water.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell people food at $20-$40  per person the least you can do is offer them a wet wipe.",

    "text": "Went here to dinner last week with a couple of friends visiting from out of town. From the outside it doesn't particularily stand out. Upon opening the door though, one gets a huge waft of what's to come inside. The air just permeated of spicy, garlicky goodness. I tell you, it smelled SO good. A bit of disclaimer on this review: I'm not too big on most seafoods so take it with a grain of salt, for sure.  I realize it might sound odd then, that I would want to go to such a place. But hey, I love good friends and good food. And both at the same time? Fuhgedaboudit! And besides, theres still plenty I can find to partake of on the menu. By reading some of the Yelp reviews previously, it seemed the thing to make a nice mess of what's left at the end of one's meal. You are prepared for the upcoming melee with stylish HnJ logo plastic bibs and tools to dismantle shells. We were also warned that their sauces were very hot, so it was suggested to order one level lower than what you think you want. My friends got a mix of HnJ shrimp, crab legs, clams and crawfish. I opted for some etoufee, sweet potato fries and fried catfish basket with cajun fries. I also asked for some HnJ special medium sauce on the side so I could drench everything in it. My friend said all their food was great. I loved the HnJ special sauce. Probably could've gone to Hot, but the medium had a nice kick with savory garlic-ness. I was using a spoon to scoop the sauce from the bottom to make sure I got all the garlic bits and spices that settle to the bottom. I did have a feeling there was no cajun seasoning on the fries. No big deal, I just used the side sauce. Overall service and food was right on.",

Known for it's crawfish, I more enjoyed the spicy crab legs & shrimp. Order by the weight of the food in a plastic bag & use your hands to eat. They give you a plastic bib and rolls upon rolls of paper towels on your table. It's really messy (NOT DIRTY, there is a difference) but my opinion quite worth it. I was full when I arrived here with friends and I still ended up being the last one to finish eating.   Would definitely go here again when I visit Las Vegas. This is the newer location, only slightly closer to the strip. I have not been to the older location, but probably will visit it when I'm there next. Highly recommend if you don't mind using your hands to eat.   The only bad thing I can think of is my hands smelled like garlic for a week.....but is that really a bad thing? Keeps the vampires away. :D  My rating 1-10 (10 being the best) Atmosphere: 9+ Food: 9+ Cleanliness: 7 Noise: 7 Service: 7 Overall: 9",

Most people prefer Pho to cure their hangovers of course but I made it a point to try this before going back home this trip.  I was never a huge fan of Crawfish but I am definitely a fan now! I've tried Crawfish at Boiling Crab and it never stuck to me the way Hot & Juicys did. I usually order Shrimp but after trying Hot & Juicys Crawfish, I've gotten a whole new perspective of cajun food. Their Crawfish was flavorful, soft and melts in your mouth type of seafood. Definitely worth the extra hardwork to peel for those little things!  I did try their shrimp and I did not enjoy it very much. It seemed bland and the flavor was lacking. The shrimp just didn't seem as fresh as boiling crabs. I will just have to eat Crawfish at Hot N' Juicy from here on out but definitely worth it.  The service was good, they had a friendly staff and they were aware of their customers which I liked. 4/5 because it was great but the only downside was the Shrimp. Will be back for the Crawfish though!",

The server Dani advised me she had to go down to the other location because the gift card machine wasn't working.

    "text": "Omigoodness! My friend and I held our own competition between HnJ and BC. I read reviews of both places and after much research, careful review and taste, Hot n Juicy takes the cake...hands down!  The service here is awesome! I came in and put my name in to be seated. The lady told me how long the wait was, which was not that long, and I sat down and observed the others delve into their bags. Then when the time came for my friend and I to be seated, our waitress was right there ready to take our order. I asked some questions and she had answers to all of them. She was super nice and told me her honest opinion of some of the food. I decided to get what I got at BC to make a fair decision, so I ordered two pounds of the snow crab legs. One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well. And off she went to put our order.   From the tome we put or order in, to the time our food was in front of me was probably around ten min. At BC it was linger and I had to check to make sure my order was still on the way. My friends food came out first. Luckily, she waited for mine to come out and then we began stuffing our faces. Holy goodness and juiciness! At BC, I had to fight to get to the meat and it wasn't as sweet or juicy, but not here. The crab legs were tender, sweet, juicy and hot! I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty!  The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good. I dipped the legs in the medium then mild after a few. I ate some of the crawfish too and that was really juicy as well. Some of them were a bit small, but still yummy. Our lady checked in with us a few times and each time I had no words, but nods because I was so into my food, and my mouth was full. I was already eating with my hands, to speak with food in my mouth would be throwing manners completely out the window.  By the end of our meal, I was ready to pass out. All worth smelling like garlic for the rest of the night and into the next day.   The place has an open layout. They have booths, tables and chairs. Flat screen tv's hang on the walls and they also play music. The noise level is pretty high, but that's to be expected.   I will be back here! Some may not like it because you eat with your hands and all the sauce and juice is just popping and flying. But they do offer gloves and a bib. So not to worry. This type of stuff you miss when you're not there. How can you beat the service, juicy food and hip atmosphere? Well, you don't.",

I do prefer this place over Boiling Crab! We usually get snow crab legs, shrimp and oysters on the half shell. Our go to sauce is the Hot N Juicy Medium. Nice and spicy and flavorful. They offer you gloves for your hands but they are the big loose ones so I just opt out of those - they have a roll of paper towels on your table so you're pretty good with using those and then a quick trip to the bathroom to wash it all off. One of the sinks you have to keep pressing for water which is quite annoying because your hands are pretty messy afterwards so if they have two sinks that just stayed ON, it would be much better!  You do have a garlic taste in your mouth for at least a day after eating here but that's the price you pay for buttery garlicy goodness! NOM!",

    "text": "As a going away dinner, a coworker chose this spot to eat, chill and be together before they head out. So, last week a reservation was made to hold a spot for 20 people. Then this morning I called to ensure we had an area for 20 and that we'd be there at 630pm. Whoever I spoke to said \"got it\". So here's my complaint.  I get here late because the parking area sucks. It's not their fault but the area where they're located is pretty popular. Next, as I walk into the restaurant the whole party is standing. Uhmmmm, why? Well because they don't take reservations. OH REALLY? So why did I call and make sure the reservation was set and you tell me it's all good? ERIC, DO NOT tell me who I spoke to because you clearly spoke out of your ass. I'm frustrated because how are we supposed to plan an event like this and your WHOLE STAFF failed to communicate to us that your facility does not do reservations. Not only did you set back our plans for the night but you looked like an idiot when you told me who I spoke to with your sass.  Next, \"the party of 20 has to sit 10 and 10 otherwise the wait is going to be longer\" WHY IN BABY JESUS WOULD I WANT MY PARTY TO SIT SEPARATELY?  I have a bad attitude as it is and he added to the fuel.   Eventually we sit down, everything went smooth after that. I wish I caught the name of our waiter because he was awesome and actually put me in a better mood.  I'm only giving one star because the staff failed to accommodate the needs of our party, the host was rude which put me in a bad mood and I personally like another restaurant that is extremely similar to this restaurant where people are more friendly.",

We called the original location... 25 min wait, called here...no wait, so of course we came here. Bigger location then the original, thus more seating and people. We had both the crab and shrimp. As always, taste is excellent. I make it a point to come in late and on a day when I know the next day I will not be out of the house because it will take at least 2 showers and 20 hand washings to get the scent out of your body. Don't get me wrong the taste is well worth it! The onle pet peeve that I had was that once again the waitress we had we practically had to chase down to get what we needed.I know that it gets busy, but having to flag them down sucks. Kinda makes you not want to order more and just ask for the check. I think next time, we will wait for a table at the original location. .",

Nothing was fresh or good except the clams and fish. The crab was $15 a lb and tasted so bland and not fresh. The dozen of oysters was also horrible. Worst oysters I've ever ate and also not fresh. My most expensive dishes were both horrible. Our bill for just 2 was $90 including tip. But not only did our food taste like crap, our waitress was very rude that she pushed us off to another waitress. The next day my whole party of 10 all had stomaches and the bathroom was our best friend. It completely ruined my Vegas trip, yet alone the car ride home and it lasted for 2/3 days.

Service was good and attentive.  When you have to call for a server, they're right there immediately.  The shrimp and crabs were cooked to perfection as always.  The only reason why I gave it a lower star is because the sauces tasted different.  We ordered mild spice on the sauce but it tasted like it was prepared medium.  Not sure if this is the server's but I could barely taste my food because it was too spicy for me.    Overall, I'll keep coming back just because it's part of Vegas and the shellfishes are always cooked right.  I'll just have to make sure to order sauce that is less than mild... maybe they'll do it light for me.  ;)",

I hadn't been back since then and after a night of staying out until the wee Vegas hours and a late night performance, my dance team and I were looking to get our grub on. We decided that this would be a great way to enjoy spending time together while eating yummy, spicy, Cajun goodness.  There were 17 of us so we were surprised that they could accommodate a party that large. We had to split up into 2 different tables, which that wasn't a problem for us. We're not high maintenance like that :) we were able to still interact and even share food!  They took our order right away and the food came out shortly. I ordered a 1/2lb. of shrimp, Mild, with all of the sauces, corn on the cob, white rice and Cajun fries to share. PLENTY of food and I ate ALL of it. Their \"mild\" was more like medium/hot. It was really funny watching everyone sweating from their food. I had a couple of friends order Medium or hot and they were DYING. So be careful if you're sensitive to spice levels because it's NOT what you will expect. Luckily, I LOVE spicy foods so the mild being medium/hot was a blessing in disguise. I'm pretty sure I thought about seconds and even packing leftovers because it was just THAT good   at the end of the meal, they were amazing enough to split the check for us. It was an awesome dining experience.   Note: there's another Hot & Juicy location down the way so if you're going to meet up with friends, make sure you specify which one on Spring Mountain Rd.

I had been going to the other location on Spring Mountain for years and one bad experience sent me packing. But this location has changed my mind about your food for the better.  I came here with a couple of friends for a late lunch on a Sunday. They were a bit busy but thankfully we got seated right away. Since they walked us to a table in the back of the restaurant, I was able to get a good look around. It was nice to see that they keep everything clean. Considering the waiters are also the bussers, that says a lot. The staff definitely stays on top of their sections!  Once we were sat we were given bibs and menus right away and we were asked what beverages we wanted. Quick service for sure! That's always nice. Loren was our main waitress and she made sure that we got exactly what we ordered. She also stayed on top of making sure our food was coming out. Overall awesome waitress!!  I can't remember what everyone ordered but I personally ordered one pound of crawfish with juicy Cajun medium and a pound of snow crab with lemon pepper medium. While the flavors were amazing and everything was cooked perfectly, the heat wasn't quite there for me. Loren definitely changed that. She got me a side of spicy sauce so I could add it to my food. Still wasn't hot enough for me. So she made sure they really kicked it up a notch and got me the extra spicy. The heat still wasn't there but she warned me it'd come as I kept eating it. Thank you for the warning, you saved me from having a stomach ulcer!  Once that heat kicked in it was over. Definitely satisfying though!!  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and time here at Hot N Juicy. The vibes were great and the food was greater, so we'll definitely be back to enjoy more!",

Our server was London, she really made our date great, she was warm and super on top of it! We both really had a great time. I usually go to the location down the street, but I'll be coming back to your location because we loved London. Wanted to make sure you guys knew how great she is. Anyhow, my craving was satisfied and the bf loved it too and the sauce, but I'll be back soon for my next seafood boil fix! Yum!",

We requested it be cooked longer for us. The waiter told us he had to ask the cooks if they could do that. When he returned we were told if they fry it longer and we are still unsatisfied with the catfish we would still have to pay for them. We just returned them as they were. After that incident our waiter did not return to help us at all, we had to ask random waiters walking by for help. The other waiters were not extremely friendly either. The crab legs and shrimp were DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely return but I would only do takeout as their customer service is HORRIBLE!",

Had to wait, not too long, for a table (apparently the other location on Spring Mtn is even busier). We all ordered 2 items (I ordered king crab, mild with garlic butter). Another person in my party ordered the same. I also ordered the fried catfish. Hubby had 1/2 lb shrimp (med spice, hot n juicy flavor). Also had a couple of sides (corn fritters-a little sweet but good, soft shell crab-pretty good, calamari-Spicy and great!). Everything was REALLY delicious. MY 2 items (king crab and catfish) took FOREVER! No joke! My entire party recvd their ord, I'm sitting there with NO food. Asked our server where my food was, he said it's coming, 8 more mins. Asked again 10 mins later. He said \"let me check\". Finally got my crab (maybe a total of 20-25 mins after the table got theirs? Everyone was pretty much done with their meal. I NEVER recvd my catfish. No one really cared?-not the main server, not the \"food\" server, register gal....no one? I mean, just tell me you made a mistake and didn't place my ord from the start? Yes, catfish wasn't on our bill, quite honestly, he should have comp'd my crab too?   Anyway, the food is great, would try them again. Just hope they get their service together.",

Food was nothing short of amazing, I practically ordered everything on the menu for a group of 6 and everything came out in quick fashion.  Only problem was a rude table next to us that seemed to complain about everything. There was nothing wrong, just their attitude. I commend the staff on their ability to handle the stress in such situations. But I certainly won't let that diminish this review.  Great job guys! 7/5 would definitely recommend to others and will certainly be coming back.",

Pick your seafood of choice (dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, snow crab legs, lobster, clams, shrimp or crawfish), how many pounds, sauce (Louisiana style, garlic butter, lemon pepper, juicy cajun, or hot & juicy -- which is all combined), choose your spice level (baby spice, mild, medium, spicy, extra spicy), pick additives (corn on the cob, potatoes, sausage, etc)... AND WATCH THE MAGIC UNFOLD! Everything gets mixed up in a plastic bag, served hot. Tables are covered with plastic & you are given plastic bibs. They provide plastic gloves, but what's the fun in that? Tie up your hair, roll up your sleeves and get in there!    We order the same thing: - A POUND OF SHRIMP, HOT & JUICY WITH TWO CORNS. Not a fan of spicy foods, I opt for \"baby spice\" and he goes for mild. We both also get a side of rice!   TIP: They also give you little cups of salt & pepper and lemon wedges. Squeeze those babies in there and they make a zesty dipping sauce!   CON: Do not go here hoping to do much afterwards. Your hair, nails, clothes, purse, life in general will leave with an intense garlic/shrimp aroma that will not leave until you shower and wash your clothes! :D",

Either location on Spring Mountain is fine to me, although this location is a lot roomier!  I always get snow crab legs with the hot n juicy seasoning and the hottest spice level because the flavor is so unique and delicious. Just thinking about the seasoning makes my mouth water. The only downside of eating here is my clothes have a strong smell to them for a while and if I don't put these clothes into the wash once I get home, the smell lingers around my house. But I don't mind this at all because this place is so delicious. I just wear gloves so the smell doesn't linger on my hands, and that's about it!

    "text": "Finally popped my hot n juicy cherry! I've literally had this place bookmarked for years and I finally got around to checking it out. I went with a friend on a Sunday night and was able to get a table right away. The feel is definitely trendy and club like, they had some EDC music vibes going on. It was also nice that they had the football game on to cater to all the sports fans as well.  Now to the food! We ended up sharing the calamari, lemon pepper shrimp and hot n juicy crawfish. My favorite seasoning was the hot n juicy, it had the perfect balance of basically every flavor and tasted great with the crawfish, corn and potatoes we got. I do have to knock this place one star only for the amount of work it actually takes to eat the crawfish and shrimp. You have to man handle these bad boys pretty good to get the meat out and another sucky part is your hands smelling like seafood for a few days after. They provide you with plastic gloves, but it's honestly so much harder to try to break the food apart while wearing them. Can't win em all I guess.  Overall I'm super happy I finally stopped by and I'll definitely be back again soon. Can't wait to try something new!",

Trust me you will not regret it! Do prepare to get a little messy and to work for your food de-shelling so just be comfortable with whoever your going with... maybe not first date restaurant....It is a little pricy depending on what you order but, I continue to go back time and time again!

It was a very big inconvenience for us to have to wait an extremely long time for two order in which we told our sever about three times. He was very rude and kept coming to our table to reorder the things we told him like he forgot. We consistently had to remind him we're missing two orders and when brought one order it was wrong and had to be sent back. We were very patient and nice with our server but Jeremiah was very rude. He never came back to check on us and did not bring us napkins and more water after being asked many times. When we told the manager she made excuses and told us it is not the servers fault our order was messed up it was the kitchens because the chefs don't let the servers in the kitchen. She then said she knew about all the mistakes and would have to verify still if we were telling the truth she apologized and admitted all mistakes were brought to her attention  but then she proceeded to do nothing about it. Upon leaving our server Jeremiah ask why we wanted to talk to the manager and then laughed at us when we insisted on him getting her. The manager also gave us wet napkins and explained how our server was not going to give them to us. We had a terrible night here and our server Jeremiah was the worst do not dine at this location",

Everyone is friendly!   My recent visit, I had Loren as my server. She was bubbly, vibrant and charismatic! The service she delivered to my family and I was exceptional and incomparable to any other near by competitors. One of my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant, is my water not being refilled. She was very attentive to our needs!   The food is always great here! Their lemon peppered shrimp is my favorite! Super tasty and their shrimp had a refined texture. Which was enjoyable to munch! Half a pound and a side rice filled me up. Overall, my visit was spectacular. On my next visit, I hope to have Loren as our server again! But if not, i'm sure everyone there delivers superb service!",

    "text": "So the restaurant is featured on man vs food and BOOM!  Every one is fighting to get in the door.  I remember a while back, my friend took me to the one on the west side on Spring Mountain and we had to park down the street and walk over.  As we were getting closer, there was a line of people waiting to get into the restaurant.  It was like waiting to get into the hottest club - but when I took a look into the restaurant, it was small and a whole bunch of people just eating crawfish, crab, and shrimp with their hands, plastic everywhere, and I was just not excited to wait and go on that ride so we decided to go elsewhere.    Well, a few years have passed - I am visiting Vegas and my friends tell me that they are celebrating a bday at this restaurant - and I think \"Oh no, not sure if I want to do that\", but I decided to not be a party pooper and go.  So we were a party of 20+ and the restaurant was a good space so I was happy about that.  There were napkins and plastic everywhere on our table and the table was covered in paper.  I was told to put on a bib and order the shrimp and crawfish.    I was scared.  In my eyes, if you are going out to eat and you are paying an establishment to cook your food for you, you should not be preparing to nip/tuck (getting ready to get into surgery).  So the food comes out and here comes a bag of shrimp and a bag of crawfish that they stick in front of my face.  I ask my friends (who are not amateurs at this restaurant), \"What now?  How the hell do I eat this?\" They tell me to stick the food on the table and peel the shrimp.  Ok, peel, peel, peel, then eat.  Then the crawfish.  How the hell do I eat a crawfish?  You break off its head and pull the tail to eat the meat, I was told. 3 minutes after crushing this crawfish like a ravenous eagle, I take its insides and put it in my mouth.  Then I think, \"All this work for less than a bite full of food?\"  Don't get me wrong - the flavor was good, but this is hard work.  After I devoured my food, I was tired.  My hands hurt, I smelled like fish and shrimp, and I was ready to take a shower.  For the first time, I think it was a good experience, but the next time I plan to eat out, I will go to a restaurant that does all the work and I won't feel so dirty after eating.",

We showed up at their other location and the wait was too long for us (30min) because we had grumpy toddlers. We called this location and as luck would have it all we had to do was show up in the next 15min and we could be seated right away.   I've never been to this one, but I like the ambiance a lot more in here than the other one...so much brighter. Honestly I can't be a reliable opinion on the crawfish or shrimp because I've never once tried even a lick. BUT I can tell ya what I thought about their chicken...?...if you're even interested to hear it haha...it's not at all the reason for people to visit here. The wings were good I guess, nothing special, no fancy sauces or spices. The fries mediocre. And the chicken nuggets...I'm almost 100% sure they were the ones you get in the freezer section at the grocery store, Tyson's. Also...I'm a ketchup snob, it is my own preference that the ketchup be Heinz and their's was definitely something generic. Everyone at the table who ate the crawfish and shrimp really enjoyed it, and their Cajun fries...I know that much.   It was pretty loud in there, and the other location is the same way. I really don't like having to yell my order at the server but it is what it is. My daughter didn't appreciate the noise level, so we ate quickly and I took her outside where we played while our family finished. But otherwise, very high energy...it's a fun place to go with a really great group of people.",

    "text": "This place is a must!!!!!  However, go to Costco or Sams Club first to get a huge package of gum and mints.  You will be keeping all vampires and trampires (K-Stew) away for at least a few days......  1 Ambiance - 4 star - for an asian strip mall, where you expect nothing, you get a nice, large place, high ceilings, decent decor, room to wait and plenty of table and chairs. You are in a busy area, so parking is easy / not easy.  It is crowded.  2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here is young and very pleasant. I think that people here enjoy working here, enjoy explaining the in and out of what to do and how to order. I really enjoy the staff here.   3  Food - 5 star - Wow, amazing, tasty and an experience that adds to the overall feeling.  a.  Shrimp - Large, tender, juicy, filling, easy to peel. b.  Crawfish - Well, they are crawfish, eat the tail only, a small bit of meat and tasty, just a lot of work to get to the tiny morsel of meat... c.  They have plenty of other choices, blue crab, snow crab, dungeness, lobster, mussels and more.  I just stuck to shrimp and crawfish. d.  Sauces - We try the Lemon Pepper and the Hot Juicy in mild and medium. Yummy and not too hot.   e.  Quantity - Easy to order more, generally 1 lb of shrimp per person at least and 2 lb of crawfish per person.  you get a potato and corn with 2 lb order of the crawfish!  Doesn't seem like enticing, however, when you are burning calories just to eat, to chow down on a marinated corn or potato is nice and different.  4.  Price - All are market price, however, for three of us eating about 7 - 8 lb of food, I generally spend about 30.00 per person, which is a good deal for seafood.    5.  Toilets - OK, this place must be owned by an asian person because the toilets need to be modernized or cleaned...  Hey, we are going here for the toilets though......  GK says, great place.  Check it out.",

They should have named this place HOT & JUICY SEAFOOD!  We checked it out, they also serve Shrimp with the head on, mussels, green and black, crab, snow, dungeness, and king. they also have Maine Lobster.  We ordered the shrimp $11.99/#  with the original sauce medium.... Thanks to our waitress she talked us first timers into the mild, it was plenty spicy, we added the cagin fries, and a corn.  we also tried the butter garlic with the cagin spice, hard to tell the difference but you could taste the additional butter and garlic.  Staff was awesome, you'll get a bib and gloves if you want.  the first time they also gave us salt and pepper which she said to squeeze lemon wedges to give us an additional sauce to dip our shrimp into. It's a hands on meal, you need to peel the heads and shells off the shrimp but it's fun and worth the effort.   We went back a second time, the mild wasn't as spicy as our first experience, but we'll be back for more...",

    "text": "My cousin took me here when I was in town for a week and I was so excited! Coming from the Bay Area, we of course have Boiling Crab and Kickin' Crab (my fave) so I was excited to see a seafood place with such great reviews!  The server was excellent, very hospitable and accommodating to our group which included 2 toddlers and 1 infant. I so appreciate the fact that they give plastic gloves here so burning your hands is not an issue. I wish they did this in the Bay but I'll live ha.   The adults ordered a lb of the shrimp each with a side of the cajun fries and some regular fries for the kiddies (they had just eaten so it was enough for them lol).   Most of the shrimp were cooked pretty well, some were over-cooked but I still ate them because the seasoning was so good. The cajun fries, while delicious, were wayyy too spicy for me (Note: I'm such a baby when it comes to spices so while this may not be spicy to some, it was for me haha). Probably will stick to the regular fries.   But all in all, it was a great experience. Service was attentive and food was yummy, and the pricing was pretty affordable. Didn't hurt my wallet too much aha. A go to spot in Vegas for sure!",

    "text": "Fine dining doesn't always have to be about posh surroundings and expensive dishes.  Sometimes, if the quality of the food is high and the uniqueness of the selections are compelling, the fact that you are sitting at a picnic table with a disposable tablecloth (and no plates BTW) doesn't factor into the equation.  In a town like Vegas where everything on the strip now costs an arm and a leg (or two), finding this alternative fine dining establishment just a $10 cab ride away was a pleasure.  Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a picnic table throw your food on the table type place that serves seafood by the pound.  Mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, and - of course - crawfish.  Just good quality ingredients, professionally steamed with your choice of toppings.  You can also add in some corn on the cob, potatoes and other sides just to fill out your plate.  My party tried a mix of the food with their spicy topping.    They have four tiers of spice and we chose the second to the top.  Be forewarned that the spice - while fantastically good - will bite you.  I fancy myself a spice aficienado that can handle more than most.  At first bite, the spicy didn't seem that hot.  Over time (like in the next 10 minutes), i had sweat pouring off my brow.  I felt like Nixon at a presidential debate.  If I had to do it again, woulda chose the medium just so i wouldn't have to immediately head to the hotel and take a shower.  If you, like me, at some point just guest bored of the strip and need a change - Hot N Juicy is a good find just a short drive away.  There are multiple locations in Vegas - this one in particular is located in the Chinatown area.",

The concept is really neat and different. They bring you a bag with a pound of whatever you choose (crawfish, shrimp, crab, etc) in whatever sauce you choose. I had the \"Hot N Juicy\" sauce with medium heat. It was delicious and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The crab was also delicious and we tried it all in different sauces and they were all good. The crawfish was good but not very filling and take a lot of time to eat. The fried shrimp were actually one of the best things with a cornmeal batter. Overall i really enjoyedmy experience and I will definately be back and have been twice already. The only knock is the very long wait every time and the prices are a little expensive if you get anything exotic.",

Normally the shrimp is the first to come out but we ended waiting just about 30 minutes for my husbands shrimp, while everything else was brought to our table in a matter of 10 minutes; due to the fact I seen one of the servers bring our order of shrimp to a different table and when she was told it was the wrong order, instead of asking the other servers if another table ordered it she just brought it back to the kitchen.  Asked a server about it and she said she would check on it. She came back to refill our drinks and again said she would check on it, asked another server about it and our order was finally done. My husband and I are too polite to complain, because at the end are bellies are still satisfied ;)",

    "text": "This review is dedicated to Thomas O. (1 of 5- high five!): I grew up in New Orleans, so crawfish is something I have grown up eating. Since moving away in 1998, I have been searching for some decent Cajun food, and an authentic crawfish boil is no exception. So on my most recent trip to Vegas, I knew I had to stop by Hot N Juicy Crawfish. The name alone warrants a visit to the place! Right when we landed, we headed to HNJC, we didn't even check into our hotel! The wait was a brief 20 minutes. I ordered 2 pounds of crawfish in the special sauce-- medium spicy (I think it was a level 8 of 10). I thought I could handle it. After all, I am Asian and from New Orleans- a lethal combo, duh! In 10 minutes, my crawfish arrived hot and steaming in my own personal bag. I burned my fingers trying to peel the first couple of crawfish, but I could not wait. The garlic juices were running down my fingers-- thank goodness for my bib. The size was smaller than what I am used to seeing, but the Cajun flavor I was craving was present and the spice was just perfect. ok, I couldn't take it. It was sooooo hot! But honey badger don't care. I kept burning my fingers, burning my mouth, and eventually, burning my stomach. Will I go again? Hell yeah.",

    "text": "I think I may have shed a tear on the flight home! This place was unbelievably good. I had seen HNJ profiled on Man vs. Food. So when my friend and I were in Vegas last week, we just had to try it. I didn't realize that there were 2 locations. We asked the taxi driver to take us to the original location but he didn't.  I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we were seated, that disappointment disappeared.. The table is covered in a big piece of plastic, roll of paper towels, and menus. Makes for easy cleanup. Trust me on that...Catlin was our server and she was the sweetest, nicest person ever! I had never had Crawfish before, she explained the menu, the process, and how to eat them to us. They serve most of the seafood by the pound with the exception of the shrimp, you can get them in half pound. You pick the seasoning (Louisiana Style , Juicy Cajun , Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper , Hot N Juicy Special(which is a combo of all of the seasonings)), then you order a spice level (I am a total spice whore, the hotter the better). They offered mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. They serve it in a steaming bag that is opened on the table for you to enjoy. Catlin suggested that we go with the medium as it was hot and it builds as you eat. She said to try it and if we wanted it hotter we could order something else. We started out by ordering a pound of Crawfish cooked in the HNJ special seasoning with medium spice. OMG I cannot begin to tell you how good this was. The flavor makes my mouth water as I am typing this. The medium spice was perfect and was hotter than most mediums you have probably eaten. It was so good we ordered rolls to dip into the leftover sauce. And then the debauchery began.. Once we were about half way thru we decided to order the snow crab legs in the same flavor and spice level. Chunks of garlic on the crablegs....it was heaven. Oh no, I am not finished...we then ordered 10 fried shrimp. These shrimp were butterflied, cooked in a catfish type batter. We also ordered the Cajun fries (which we couldn't even finish) but all of it was the best seafood I think I have ever had. Needless to say our table was strewn with shells, bags and lots of paper towels (yes us girls got our chow on, somethin fierce!) the whole bill came to under 60 dollars (including beers with dinner). If you are in Las Vegas GO, RUN!! to Hot and Juicy. You will not regret it! Had we had a little more time we would have went again before our flight on Friday. Next time were driving so we can take a cooler to bring back to Phoenix with us. Basically you can reheat the bags in boiling water and they will be just as good as if you were sitting at the table in Vegas.",

I don't if that might have been part of the reason why service and food was extra special, but I was SAT-IS-FIED! My shrimp was ten times bigger that day, and the staff, although changing frequently from person to person, was very accommodating to our many needs. They were super busy, but they didn't hesitate to make runs back and forth for our lemon and pepper, and refills. Thanks hot and juicy!",

Want some cocktail sauce (I think that is what it is, lol)?  It's there.    Wanna talk crawfish?  No?  Well, I do!  The crawfish come by the pound (which is how they should, by the way)... and they come in a bag-o-sauce.  Perfect for making sure all them there crawfish are evenly covered in the most amazingly delicious sauce you could ever want.  I get mine with the Hot N Juicy spice and \"medium\" spice level (although sometimes I venture to \"spicy\" when I feel like punishing myself a bit).  No matter which way you go, the crawfish are always well cooked and delicious.  The place is usually crazy busy and there is almost always a wait... and while I am a huge fan of this place, I'm guessing the wait has more to do with the prime location of this H-N-J on Spring Mountain Rd.  The waitstaff isn't always the most attentive and I have ran out of water a handful of times during my multiple visits... but I always just reach over and drink the person's water from the table next to mine.  A must-have while in Vegas!",

The atmosphere was nice and we were sat at a 8 person able even though there were only 5 of us, that's a plus because you'll need room when you eat this!   I ordered 2 lb craw fish , 2 lb shrimp with corn and sausage and potatoes. I enjoyed the \"hot n juicy\" flavor, which is a blend of all of their flavor and got the \"medium\" spice. It was yummy and the shrimps were insanely big!! Crawfish were frozen but they still were tasty. Ordered Cajun fries-- they were ok, have had better.  Service: it was ok, that's why I'm giving the place only 4 stars. Our waitress asked if we have ever been there and we said \"no,\" she didn't care to explain the menu or anything to us. She took our orders and after that she or anyone didn't come to even check on us the whole time. For first timers I feel like she should've tried to be more enthusiastic and at least asked us 1x how it was going with the food. Overall, I would come again.",

I like the fact the crawfish is fresh as that's pretty hard to find (if not impossible) at other Louisiana boil type restaurants.  The seasoning is different compared to other restaurants i've been to, which is a good thing. The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is due to the longer wait time for your food  I would definitely come back to this place",

    "text": "I love hot n juicy I could eat here everyday.  So you order seafood by the lb, it is boiled in their different sauces, and then you choose a spice level. You put on a Bib and then you eat your food out of a bag and leave it all on the table. The seafood comes whole. As in the shrimp head and all. Everything is market price. They also have some baskets which are varying fried foods like catfish, chicken nuggets, fries, ect.  Tip! You can order a half lb of shrimp which is like the perfect size.   Also if you are on a low sodium diet then look elsewhere.  I always get the same thing. Lemon pepper shrimp that is mild with some sausage steamed that gets cooked with it. Then I get a side of white rice.  If I'm feeling feisty then I get a potato.  If I'm with a group then I share some corn fritters. The sweetness really is delicious with the spicy shrimp.  I've had their etouffee and Cajun fries. The etouffee was eh and the Cajun fries are good! Spicy but not too spicy.  The price here is right, if they aren't slammed (which they usually are) the servers are all really nice.  The only bad things is that their bathroom always smells. Idk if it's a sewage thing but the men's room always smells, the trash full, and the sinks don't expel much water.   Other then that the food is good and the service is usually good for what it is, and the price is also right.",

    "text": "Okay, I KNOW the place isn't as good as the Boiling Crab in the LA area, but it's all we have in Vegas. This second location is considerably larger than the first location. When I peeked inside, I was like holy shiz, it's so huge. Most likely I'll be coming here instead of the smaller location. Traffic here will be slow compared to the other one for now since it's just recently opened.  My friend wanted to try this out so we came here for his birthday. I usually get my delicious cajun fries (they're spicy!) and 1 pound of the mild Lemon Pepper seasoned shrimp. Pretty yummy. I don't like the Hot N Juicy Special seasoning (I tried my friend's). I just prefer the lemon pepper. Don't think I'll risk the other seasonings, but I will definitely try them if a friend gets them next time. I believe I've tried them at the other location, but don't recall any of them standing out except the lemon pepper.  I absolutely adore the fries! Hell, just get the sweet potato fries and eat both of them. They both taste yummy. Just make sure you don't wear WHITE when you go eat as you might make a mess on yourself and just wear a dark-colored top. Yes, you get the bib but it doesn't cover all of you. With that being said, enjoy your seafood :)!",

A little over priced compared to Boiling crab. Environment @ BC is much more friendlier. Food portion is much less generous than BC and overall i was very dissatisfied. If you don't like sweet in your shrimp, and prefer a more savory and bold flavor, go to boiling crab, other wise, Hot n Spicy isn't the place for ya!",

We had great service, and I think the price is very good.  One thing though, I asked the server where they get the crawfish and she said Louisiana.  Find that hard to believe because they aren't in season, unless they freeze them.  The crawfish is small.  But everything else is really good, especially the shrimp.  We had the mild...my friend is a wimp...but it was very tasty.  Next time I go, getting the extra spicy!!!",

They claim that their super spicy is really spicy, but this is not the case.  Don't be afraid to eat spicy, it is the best sauce.of the bunch.  Also sprinkle a little bit of lemon on everything and you will not be disappointed.  Don't eat here if you don't want to get covered in sauce.  In addition to the bib, they also give you gloves.  Everything you eat is covered in sauce and nothing is shelled.  You gotta know that you will get dirty, but it is worth it.    We ordered crab, crayfish, breaded catfish, and shrimp.  The shrimp was by far my favorite.  Order extra shrimp and don't waste your money on the crab.  You only get two wimpy crabs for the same price as you get 25-30 shrimp.  Also order the corn fritters.  They are very good.  Again, this place was a really nice change of pace from where we had eaten in Vegas previously.  The prices were good, we all ate for under $18 a person, which was really reasonable.",

I've noticed that if I go in there with 1 person, we sort of get good service (and by that I mean we get checked on about 2 times), but otherwise if I go in there by myself, forget it. There is no service. Which is sad because I do tend to order a lot with proper service but when you're getting ignored even when you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs blatantly looking around for a waitress, it's frustrating. The crawfish are cleaned incorrectly (black and cracked, that's not right) my 2 lb bag had more claws than actual crawfish...that was seriously disappointing. I won't be going back, I tried to give it more than a few chances but every time I go, I'm quickly reminded why I didn't like it last time.",

After securing your bib you put on your plastic gloves and boom you're ready to demolish some sea creatures for an hour or two!  The food comes out happily swimming in one of their five house sauces, and you order by the pound. Plop! See through plastic bags of shrimp, mussels, crawfish, lobster, will be thrown on the table and your mission begins. It's an exported Louisiana style dining experience! I recommend getting the Hot n Juicy sauce, at mild spiciness. It's by far the tastiest and their mild spicy level has a deceivingly strong kick. This is for garlic lovers only, and is not a low sodium meal!  This year the crawfish were smaller and out of season, so they were made from frozen and not as fresh. The shrimp were large and excellent as always, and served with the head on. Mmm, brains. For mussels order the green mussels over the black, they will be larger and more flavorful.   Great for groups and sharing, but also fun for a date with some hands on eating!",

Here's the thing I really try not to ding businesses on little things but when it's too many little things that can add up to big things I have to give the proper amount of stars. I came here last week with Two of my girlfriends for a lunch date. We were seated promptly which was a plus but then it seems that everything went down hill after that. For starters, they weren't even that busy and the fact that it too almost 10 mins just to get our drinks was already the first red flag! Once we received our drinks another waiter comes to bring us more drinks? I'm guessing there was a miscommunication because he brought the wrong drinks.. Hmm so once it came to ordering the food we ordered collectively the shrimp..crab legs and a catfish basket. All of the orders came out at different times and about 10 mins apart with the catfish taking the longest. They brought the fries out first then one by one our food? Wtf? Idk but the only thing that was good was the food the service was beyond ridiculous. We never got asked for refills after eating this hot food you would think you would check in ever so often? That wasn't the case. Even the check took another 10-15 minutes after asking to pay we almost felt like our meal was free! Ha! No thanks I prefer the boiling crab! Won't be returning",

    "text": "Normally this would go without saying, but it happened; sorppt 74 minutes is too long to wait for food once youve ordered. Thats 1 hour and 14 minutes of sitting at a table waiting for a simple order. We came as a party of two; we're regulars so, whenever we come here we order as soon as we sit down because we are familiar with the long wait times. We know what we like and get the same order every time, we love the restaurant and always bring in our family and friends, and this is the first time we have ever come down and had to wait so long for anything.   Our simple order was for 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Spicy), 1 lb of Shrimp HnJ Special (Mild), and two sides of rice.   After the many times we have come we know that ordering clams / oysters takes about 25 min, ordering wings or fried cod can take from 30min-40min, but cajun/regular fries and shrimp are usually under 20 min. Yes i acknowledge that it was busy, it was the lunch rush when we came, and you did have 2 parties of at least 8 people maybe more, but still 74 minutes is a long time to wait from ORDERING to RECEIVING the food.  After 45 minutes we asked a waitress to check on our order, she left and came back and said, \"Your order is coming, when you got here the kitchen was behind at least 20 orders, ok? so its not as if we forgot about you.\" Heres a tip, customers aren't as interested in hearing an excuse of whats taking so long, as what you are/will be doing to remedy the situation, also note that a simple apology or showing that its unacceptable to wait so long goes a long way. No one was apologetic or sincere until the end of our meal, when someone dropped off the check and said, \"Here you are, and I'm sorry for the wait.\" The end of the meal is too late for the apology, it should happen in real time.  I was here twice last December and completed a survey each time, each visit the store wasnt busy, no wait time on a table and the friendliness was outstanding, straight 5s across the board. I hope your standards arent slipping, and your service isnt failing, i would hate for an tasty restaurant to suffer from bad/neglected service.",

    "text": "It's always a fun food experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish! The flavors and seasonings have all been too spicy for most of my friends and family (even the mild one, unfortunately), so the 'hot' in \"Hot N Juicy\" shouldn't be taken lightly. And although I'm a huge crawfish fan, I do recommend the shrimps more than the crawfish because the shrimps are meatier, easier-to-peel and are an overall better bang for the buck. Make sure to order sausage slices too because those are amazing in the bag with the seafood!  Don't wear anything too nice and don't plan on going anywhere where people will judge you on your guaranteed garlic scent! (Also, one of the waiters spill the bag of crawfish on my husband, so keep your distance when they bring the food to your table...)  In terms of locations, the one that's closer to the strip is newer and less busy, so I recommend that over the original location!",

We got the shrimp first and it was really, really good! We chose medium spicy and it was perfect. Only $7.99!  Not too shabby.  Then we got the crawfish. Tiny, overly spicy (medium too), and NO MEAT!  I didn't expect it to be that meaty, but I'm talking TINY. We asked the server and she did admit we came off season and the meat is pretty much non-existent, but we wish someone told us first and we would have gotten more shrimp instead.  Wasn't busy on a Thursday afternoon. This is the newer location and it was clean and plenty of parking. Not too far from the strip if you drive.",

Also I left a $15 cash tip, which I wanted to give to our waitress polina..  But she said she couldn't accept. However if I mentioned it on here the company may give her the tip direct...

I had 2lbs of crawfish and in medium Hot and Juicy sauce. Really liked it, though would probably go with shrimp to it is easier to eat next time. My wife and oldest loved the crab and shrimp they had in garlic butter.   My two younger kids were not as impressed. First, my son's fried shrimp (not the most complicated order) got lost, not once but twice. He got his food nearly 30 minutes after we had gotten ours. Also, my youngest really had a hard time finding something she really liked. It was ok for kids, but probably a better place for adults.   Overall, very great place to spend Father's Day with my family and our friends and their kids. But communication between servers and kitchen needs to be better. The food came out very inconsistently for all of us over a 10-minute period, let alone the completely unacceptable handling of my son's meal.",

    "text": "To set the record straight, I am not a fan of crawfish.. they have a weird scent to them that I can't get over :S I've tried them once before (not from here) and I wasn't a fan. Maybe this place will change my opinion?   We arrived on a Thursday night and this place was packed! Apparently, there are two locations. I don't know if the service/food differs, but we decided to wait for a seat. Within 15 minutes, we were seated, which isn't too bad. We ordered three different flavors of crawfish - two pounds of cajun, one pound of hot n juicy, and one pound of the lemon and pepper. The first two flavors were not bad, the third we could've done without. The crawfish were juicy, fresh, and flavorful.. not bad, not bad! Each one pound order of crawfish comes with a side of corn on the cob, yum. If you order two pounds, you get corn on the cob and potatoes!   Aside from crawfish, we also had an order of garlic butter clams. They were ok, could've done without as well. The weird garlic that was used had a strong kick to it which reminded me of straight up horse radish.  All in all, the food was not bad for someone who isn't a fan of crawfish. Top it off with some blue moon, and you'll be set!   I do have to admit one thing, though... I felt like I was in a club when I was dining in there. They had some club trance music going on, which made me feel as if I had to peel the crawfish to the beat lol. It was interesting....",

    "text": "After reading the excellent yelp reviews, I drove down from LA for the day just to try this place.  I was craving some crawfish and finding good crawfish up here hasn't been easy lately.  So, I got in the new ride, picked up my companion, plugged in the iPod, and just hit the road. What a way to spend a Saturday.    OMG!!  Ultimately, although I wanted to eat more, I refrained from pigging out.  I stopped eating after I ate three pounds of crawfish...and yes I'm consoling myself with the fact that three pounds included the shells...yes, that's it!  And...no I didn't eat the shells.  So I really only ate maybe a pound or so of actual crawfish meat.  Anyway, the first two pounds were in the medium Cajun boil served with a corn cobbette and a potato.  The boil was flavorful with a light heat and the crawfish were of good size.  When I was done, I ordered another pound of crawfish in the spicy hot and juicy boil.  Great flavor, particularly with the garlic touch.  And those mudworms were large!  They looked like mini- lobsters.  I actually ate the claw meat, something I generally don't do given their small size.  After all, there is a limit to just how much work I want to do for a meal. Now, I know to just order the spicy boil flavors since I generally like foods with a high heat.  Before I forget, the sweet potato fries were good too.  I liked that our food server kept the coke cups full and the staff checked in often.   My companion ate the fried shrimp and the chicken wings with potato fries.  While he ate everything because he was hungry, he didn't particularly care for it.  I'm thinking that figures since the house specialty is the crawfish. But unfortunately, because these items are on the menu, they could use a bit more attention; hence, a four star rather than a five star rating.  The restaurant was clean and, importantly, so were the restrooms!  Now, if you're too prissy to eat with your hands and you have a problem with not using a plate, then this isn't the place for you, even though they give out nice bibs and you eat from a plastic table cover.  Keep in mind, you do eat from a plastic bag and you drink from styrofoam cups...okay so that's not environmentally friendly but who cares!?!  I even bought a tank shirt...and that's an unusual move for me.  I'm thinking I'll definitely be back...and next time, I'll try shop No. 1 to see if it's as good as shop No. 2.",

Asked 3 staff but they just keep saying \"ok\"... Really?  and oh! Where's the butter? Isn't that a very simple request? Where's my water? How come we only have 3 pcs of gloves?

    "text": "Um, I'm kinda in love with this place. I've been trying to come here for a few times, and even went once but the wait was too long for a large party.   This time, my lil sister Jenni took me here Saturday night around 7pm for dinner - just the two of us this time. This is Hot N Juicy II, a little further east than I, and the place seems more updated and less crowded than I.   It's such a fun environment. The waitresses are all super nice and laid back, there is Top 40 radio going on in the background, and everyone is eating with their hands! The wait a table for Jenni and I was about 20 minutes.   I love crawfish but the shrimp was recommended to get more bang for your buck and also because they're delicious, of course! We each got a pound of shrimp in the Hot N Juicy Special sauce (which is a combination of all the sauces they offer). The food came out in about 10 minutes, hardly any wait. The mild was a tiny bit spicy for me (I'm a big spice pansy) but perfect for that extra kick. The shrimp that arrived were perfectly seasoned in that amazing sauce, and were each a good size. We also got an order of sweet potato fries that were super tasty, well seasoned, and a generous portion at that. This was definitely the right amount of food for the two of us.   Our bill for 2 lbs of shrimp and an order of sweet potato fries came to be around $26 without tip. Not bad for a seafood dinner.   Tip: Jenni, a seasoned HNJC customer, recommends that you keep your wardrobe in mind when coming here. You tend to leave with your clothes smelling a little like garlic, and the scent definitely sticks on your hands for at least a day. :)",

    "text": "So my previous review was of the other HNJ closer to Decatur and it was not good. I thought surely this other location (valley view) cant be as bad so my friend and I went here for dinner tonight and im sure glad we did. We arrived at 730 and were seated in about 5 minutes. The hostess was super cheerful and friendly and gave us bibs and a fresh roll of paper towels as she sat us. Our server came shortly after and asked for our drink orders and asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so they could explain how it works to my friend. Our server was very thorough she took the time to explain the different shellfish and the different seasonings. We decided on 1lb of shrimp each with the hot n juicy seasoning but hers extra spicy and mine just mild. I like spicy things but that mild gets my nose running! We also ordered corn sauasage and potato in our bags. And we got an order of cajun fries. Our fries came out within 8 minutes they were hot and golden and had a little kick to them...they were just perfect. 5 minutes later our shrimp came and we dug right in. Deeeeeelicious! My friend really enjoyed her meal and was happy i picked that spot for our dinner. The food was on point and the service was wonderful im so glad I went to this location because I will be coming back.",

Our waitress was a sweetheart, and even demonstrated to us how to peel a crawfish (it was my first time having them, and they are a lot of work!)    By far my favourite combination was Hot n' Juicy, mild spice snow crab - the meat is so sweet, tender and meaty.. you can remove an entire section and use it like a paintbrush with the juice.

    "text": "holy sh*t, i love this place.!!  literally, sh*t... frankly, having this as one of my favorite digs defies common logic as i KNOW eating here will make me sh*t like crazy later.!  TIME SPENT once a week @ Lunch/Dinner times.  LAYOUT this is the newest in the chain.   the older place is just a couple blocks away.!   i found HnJC to look like a mix between a brewery and sports bar.  SERVICE no matter which HnJC you're at, the service is OUTSTANDING.   people are cheerful and conversational.   not only do servers ask what you need, but EVERYONE who works there will also eventually ask what you need.  FOOD there's an arguement here on how good the food is.   as i rave about the taste, my southern friends disagree that it's better back home.^^;  my one CON is the Snow Crab's \"freshness\" being on par with local buffet quality.   i found the shell soft and flavor off (sauce saves it).    you are basicly paying $16 a 1ib for something you can pay $24 and eat without limit at a buffet ($15 @ Rio's World Buffet as a local).  i have ALOT of friends who don't like shellfish, so can recommend their sweet-potato fries, shrimp etouffe (sp.?), battered shrimp, and battered catfish as alternate foods...  all of which, i don't order, but highly enjoy stealing from those who do.^^  PRICING   on average, i eat 6-8ibs of various items (crawfish, clams, snow crab) which normally run $50-$80.   i've had friends do 1-2 ibs of things and spend $20ish...  maybe that'll give you a rough idea.  CLOSING HnJC will leave you with a lasting impression.  the service and welcoming you recieve there make it feel like you're eating at home with friends.   it also doesn't hurt that all the waitresses are gorgeous to boot.^^   it's as if they the catalogue of Suicide Girls were waitressing the establishment.!  TIPS 1.  SAUCES: please don't bother with getting anything under SPICEY.   the seafood just tastes bland otherwise.    EXTRA SPICEY will make you cry. 2.  Wear clothes u don't care about so you don't have to wear those ridiculous looking bibs...  some people go as far as wearing hamburger helper gloves to eat.!   please save yourself the embarrassment of looking stupid. 3.  i like to save whatever sauces is left over and pour them into one bag to go.   i know - it sounds YUCK...  but the sauce is great with everything you cook.   Omelletes (sp.?), over dry noodles with egg, etc.",

Specifically, my go-to bag of goodness is one pound of Hot n Juicy medium shrimp with 5 corn. Last night, I decided to switch it up. I ordered a bowl of their Etouffee and forewent the shrimp. However, I did hitchhike 3 pieces of corn in someone else's bag of shrimp. Corn on the cob is just oh so good when it's been swimming with the shrimps. I enjoyed the Etouffee; it came extremely hot and had nice spice to it. It was a nice diversion, but I'm going back to shrimp next time. Coz shrimp in a bag is just my bag baby.",
