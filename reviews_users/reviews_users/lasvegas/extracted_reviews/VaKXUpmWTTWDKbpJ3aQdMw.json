I only ever get bone-in wings and sometimes they end up dry - it's a hit or miss. The only flavor I really like is spicy garlic. The rest are just ok and the lemon pepper is downright horrible compared to Wingstop.  I'd only go here if I was in the area and it happened to be happy hour. Lots of TVs to watch sports if that's your thing.  Warning: It gets really cold at this location (at least all the times I've been there).  Tip: Get the regular fries with chipotle bbq seasoning! Pretty darn good.",

That dipping sauce makes them wonderful. But they should give a few more for their price.  The chicken wings are always good and cooked the way I asked.  They have different drink specials all the time.  I like their cheddar cheese curds and their fried pickles as well.  Good bar food. Love all the tvs everywhere.

    "text": "This place is disgusting. After not having dined at a Buffalo Wild Wings in YEARS, my husband did not want to stop at Wing Stop on the way home, and since BWW is just around the corner from my home, he urged me to try it again. Never ever again.  It was Thursday and they have a wonderful deal of $.60 boneless wings, except that they ended up coming out as fried little pieces of sub-par \"chicken\". We got 5 sauces: mango habanero, spicy BBQ, Thai curry, lemon pepper,and garlic parm. They were all terrible. The garlic parm was HORRIBLE! They squirt slimey, sticky \"sauce\" all over these wings, without a hint of real cheese or garlic and call it good. Lemon pepper was the best, although probably because they were plain fried \"chicken\" and weren't coated in one of their disgusting sauces. Thai curry shouldn't even be a flavor of chicken wings because they were disturbing. Spicy BBQ was nothing original, and on the same level as lemon pepper. Mango habanero were so spicy that we could only eat one each because we didn't want to be in agonizing pain.  We also ordered a side of fries, which were cut skinny and fried crispy. I liked the fries, and tried the salt and vinegar seasoning. The seasoning was tasty for the first couple of bites, but got old very quickly. Overall, we tossed most of the wings because we only tried about 1 of each, when we ordered 30 wings total followed by extreme bloating the following day. We will definitely stick to their competitor.",

Originally went to the casino to watch the football games and due to the over crowdedness we headed up here! Greeted promptly when we walked in but headed straight to the bar where there were plenty seats! The bartenders were all very pleasant and professional! Good came out very fast and fresh which is always a plus! But then again how long do traditional wings and it boneless really take? You can tell that there are plenty locals that come here on the regular because there were plenty people greeted by names by the bartenders! Will return again!",

I arrived a little late, at 11:50PM; the girl at the front desk was originally perplexed and asked if I was \"sure I was at the right store\" until she opened up the order on her screen. She then said she would go and grab it from the back for me. Ten minutes later, she came out and said it \"was going to be a few minutes,\" as one of the \"wing orders was extra crispy.\" I noted when the order was placed, and the designation for pick-up time, a time that was now twenty minutes past (i.e., the wings should have been ready before I had even arrived.) Finally, at ten past midnight (I would have left, but she completely disappeared, giving me no opportunity to receive a refund and leave), she came out with my wings. No apology, no refund, no offer to bring a manager forward. Just a blank stare.  To add insult to injury, when I opened my order at home (I should have checked it in store, but at that point I just wanted to leave and get home after sitting at BWW for a half hour) it was not fulfilled correctly.   As I said previously, save yourself the time and money, and head up to Hualapai for BWW. At least their service is timely, consistent, and their staff are attentive and responsive.",

I was seated promptly after arriving to a Tuesday bball game night with $0.60 wing special. Place was packed.  As always, I order myself Garlic Parmesan and Honey BBQ and boyfriend orders the same along with Thai Curry. A basket of onion rings for appetizer. Not anything special, just hungry for any protein that will curb hunger.  What was supposed to be a routine 10-15 minute wait became a 45min wait. The manager did rounds to each table about 20 minutes in and conversed with customers, greatly apologizing. He said one of the fryers was down and kitchen was insanely backed up. He explained that was even no excuse for the wait and that they'll take care of our wings. (I understand that it's not human error...they're doing the best they can!) Staff was sincere and working hard. Server consistently checked in on us and refilleddrinks.  Overall: Food was ok. Onion rings were battered. Not breaded. Not really worth that long of a wait, but what got this place four stars was service.  Service was attentive despite their backup and when the manager said they'll take care of our wings to apologize for the wait, he really meant it! All the wings that night were free of charge.  One of few places where I know manager routinely does rounds with the customers' table. I don't even think other restaurants would try be so accommodating while you wait.

I hate giving bad reviews so I'll take off just 1 star because this isn't a big deal (mind you that i use to have problems at this location all the time.. one time we waited 20 mins after being seated to be greeted by someone, we actually had to ask. another time i found a peice of paper on my meal that had just been brought out to me.. but since that was 2 years ago and accidents happen I got over it and plus, I didnt yelp back then so theres no proof of it lol.) But this time I ordered wings and for the sides i chose celery sticks and ONLY celery sticks. However i got carrots and celery which im happy because the celery sticks they had given me were old. They were brown on both sides which hey, i can cut the ends out myself right? Well i mean they could too. Not a big deal because I paid for wings and the veggies are more complimentary, but, this is just a reminder to go the extra step and to fix the problem right then and there because you never know who might yelp and post a picture on here. I'm happy they got the *celery sticks only * part wrong because i ended up eating the carrots and tossing the celery.",

Unless you've been hiding under a rock all these years, you've been to a BWW location SOMEWHERE on this planet.  You know it is all about the wings.  My personal favorites are mango habanero (which I think is way hotter than the blazin), Asian zing, and thai curry.    There are a good variety of beers on tap, something for everyone I would say.  The food is always fresh, servers friendly, and always a fun time.  Only problem is that, depending on the sporting event, it gets way too crowded.  But that is part of the fun, you have massive crowds cheering for both teams.  Almost feels as if you're in the stadium.",

First time i went for takeaway they totally forgot all dipping sauces.  Seriously get home with chicken wings and go for some ranch and blue cheese and your stuck with nada.... not cool.  On top of that the actual chicken wings that I bought were way over cooked to the point that the chicken skin was rock hard crunchy, and the chicken inside was dry.  Second time the service was much better in that they checked the bag with me standing there and the order had everything including dipping sauces.  Then i got home and i went to take a bite of a chicken wing and damn near broke a fricken tooth.  Skin fried til it was rock hard, meat reminded me of eating squid tentacles (which are meant to be dense and hard), and after about 5 wings I was like nope.  What is odd, the boneless chicken nuggets my wife and the kids got... perfectly fine and tender, actually really good.  I may go to this place for chicken nuggets, but this sure as heck isn't a wing place.",

The third time, the General Manager took care of our orders and bagging and went through each box of food to make sure everything was there- success!   Everyone was very nice and helpful, just make sure you order at the front or via phone (and check your bags if you have a large order). They did everything to make us happy and I appreciate that.   We'll be making BWW a weekly thing :)",

I begin to place a to go order with JENNIFER who doesn't want to communicate with anyone else that it's to go or where it is, so I'm just sitting at the bar for about 20 minutes until I ask for my food. By then the food is cold and no one says anything about it. Neither do I, except for the fact that I will never be back. It's just kinda silly. That no communication is had amongst this place and that I had to pay for cold food. How would you feel if you had to pay for cold food? That you SPECIFICALLY ordered Togo? Weird right?",

Not to mention his attitude was far worst than ever , we still had money in the machine and he was being a complete jerk !has he ever heard of customer service ? I think not . I get that you have to play the machine and those are the rules to sitting at the bar , but hey let's try this thing called being polite ya jerk ,after we were forced to move no one sat where we were sitting guess the demand was pretty high to sit there ? On a lighter note out server Wes was a doll and the food was great as usual  , and To the bartender named Brian my tip to you is be kind when has rudeness ever paid off ?",

I believe  the graveyard wing special no longer exists and its $0.60 tues boneless or bone-in now. I remember when I first moved here in '06 and my sister told me about this great wing place that had $0.25 wings on Tuesdays and I love my wings. My eyes literally got big at the thought of it. What followed was I visiting this B-dubs every tuesday and ordering 3 different sauces of 6 wings each. I worked my way down their heat scale from the mild to hot til I tried them all. Did I say I love wings? haha The wing special price has slowly creeped up in the past 7yrs sadly and now is more than double what I originally knew.($0.25 to 0.60) Might not go as often as before due to the happy hour not being as good a deal anymore but I'll still go sometimes. I do try other items on their menu on ocassion but usually I'm there for the wings! My fave sauce has to be the spicy garlic. The fried pickles and their onion rings ain't too shabby either. Service for the most part has been great from the bartenders and waitresses. The few times theres been a problem it was promptly corrected without hesitation. Drinks refilled before the current one is empty. Great place to grab some late night grub since they are open 24hrs.",

They have great happy hour specials and on Tuesdays they have wing specials. They have a game you can play against others in the bar while your there and compete monthly which is fun. Service is good, quick and friendly. Place is clean and sport friendly. They also have an outdoor area with TV for those cool nights when you want the fresh air and still catch the games!   Highly suggest for watching sports, great apps and wings (honey BBQ my fav). Also good for the family, my nephew loves it.",

Also I should add, nothing really seemed that fresh or vibrant looking as in the pictures...even the cocktail sauce given with the shrimp was prepackaged and had an old, sitting around forever type of flavor that I did not enjoy :( Not the worst, just not the best either!",

Wes was our bartender and I gotta say, phenomenal service. But the food has disappointed way too many times. I've had several wraps and several appetizers, all of which were lacking the key ingredients. My steak wrap was definitely near steakless.  It had been awhile since eating at other locations, but I recall the same type of stingy-with-key-ingredients disappointment.   A buddy of mine swears that you should only ever order the wings. Never try for any other food item because you will be disappointed. Apparently, the wings are alright.  The things saving this place from a one-star review is the amazing service that I received at this one particular location, the number of TVs with games on, and the beer happy hour special.   Enjoy this picture of my lettuce wrap with fraction of an ounce of steak in it.  btw, I ate the half with less steak first because I wanted to save the better half for last, so this is the meatier half.

I have been craving for wings so decided to get that. While I was eating I noticed that some of the wings still has plenty of feathers. They did not even bother removing it while it is still in the kitchen. Needless to say after I saw that I lost my appetite and I just paid my bill and left.   I myself work in the industry but I don't serve food like that. During prep my team do quality control of our supply to make sure that everyone that comes to our establishment is happy with their experience.",

I usually order in the minimum increment of 4 wings, because that's usually a good amount for me. I'm usually stuffed, but that's also because I order about 2 other random flavors, depending on my mood. I do like to enjoy the southwest loaded chips because it is one of my most favorite bar/happy hour items. I remember coming here years ago, back in the Wet N Wild lifeguarding days with my good friend Charlie and getting more bang for my buck, when it came to happy hour!   I do like how close this location is to my house, so I definitely like to come when I've had a stressful week and want to chow down on some yummy wings, or 'nuggets' as a lot of my friends call it!

Our waitress, not responsive, an hour after waiting we asked where our food was and she says \"it's the World Series so the kitchen is backed up.\" Oh thanks for the heads up when we ordered or ya know checking at all at any point during the hour after we asked. Of course once our order arrived it's wrong too. My boyfriend ordered a snack size and a small was delivered while my friend ordered a large blue cheese when ranch came out. What a mess.   I will never return to this location. Terrible service with sub per food, no thanks. Not to mention we paid full price for everything on the bill. Buffalo Wild Wings please do yourself a favor and close this location.",

Well, last night our options were a bit limited being that it was Christmas Eve so we decided to give this location a try. Well, it was as expected. The food was not my favorite.   Let me say this though. The bartender was great! He was super friendly and made sure our drinks never ran low. He gets an A++. But the food cannot be overlooked. I ordered the snack size of traditional wings with mild sauce and we started with potato wedges with cheese. The potato wedges were okay but honestly a little too salty. The wing sauce was a little spicy to be considered mild in my book and the wings in themselves were super dry and overcooked. I only took a few nibbles before deciding it wasn't worth eating.   Sorry Buffalo Wild Wings. Wish I had better things to say but after trying multiple locations I've decided your wings are just not for me.",

(Even though there wasn't hardly anyone there ). Bartender wasn't friendly at all, especially the women (hate to say that! but it seems like they're always on a power trip). We're all aware that if someone wants to play, we can move; but don't say, if you're not playing, I'm going to have to ask you to move! Lady, you're getting a penny for that. Do we get a free drink if we play? Huh! Of course not, this is not a casino. PT's are all over now... getting very convenient for everyone. This means that keep up the bad attitude and you guys will be losing a lot of customers. It's not like you throw in a good happy hour menu anyway.",

    "text": "Oh gawd whenever I think about BWW's I cringe at the awful customer service I'm about to receive at the bar, no matter the location (9 times out of 10, service is awful). I also have to brace myself for freezing cold temperatures inside. Bring a jacket if you're always cold like me! For this particular visit, me and my husband met another couple at the bar. They were holding seats for us so we were able to right walk up and sit at the bar.  I have never eaten a wing in my life, or at least not that I can remember. I've been a vegetarian for over 11 years and I don't plan on eating any wings in the future either! With that being said, dining at BWW's is a happy medium for me and my dude. Why? Because they have a token black bean burger for me, along with lots of other vegetarian options like flat breads, quesadillas, and your usual neutral appetizers while he gets his wings. Both parties are content!   SCREAMIN' NACHO BURGER ($9.95?): I always order this with the black bean burger when I come to Buffalo Wild Wings. They used to have a black bean wrap but it's no longer on the menu. Fries are hit and miss. They're usually stingy with the fries. 3.5/5   SERVICE: Our waiter virtually ignored us. It was difficult to get his attention to order food and ask for refills even though he was standing directly in front of us at the bar. The other couple wanted to order a dessert but gave up because service was so slow.   VIBE: There was a sports game on but I wasn't paying attention. It was loud inside and pretty busy.   Worth a Return Visit? Probably not at this location since it's so far away from where we live. There are 3 other BWW's in much closer proximity, so it doesn't make sense to make the trek out here. Also, this location doesn't stand out at all. I'd rather get crappy service close to home.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #139",

She was bubbly and very helpful and thorough with our individual meals making sure we got everything we wanted. When we picked up the food we got that very same employee who continued being helpful throughout the process.  We finally were able to sit down to enjoy our food during a slow spot that night. The food was great. Our orders were accurate and we even had enough napkins for the mess we were about to make.  I personally ordered the jack daddy burger with wedges. The burger was juicy and loaded with toppings. I died a small death while eating this. The pulled pork was a definite plus on the burger and of course if you're going to go to bww you have to get their wedges. It was a great way to spend my cheat day.  I would definitely go back here as the entire experience was a positive and easy one! Great job guys!!",

By JENNY LYNN i specifically asked for her to clarify her name because she deserves 10+ stars for her customer service and should be recognized. As to the food always prepared right. Always tasty , as to waiting and time frame this location is usually always busy and is not necessarily a \"fast food\" joint, and i do try to always plan ahead of time as you would say and if they are to busy , i go sit at the bar and they always try to provide the best service they can. No one can be perfect but imagine i took the time out of my \"relaxing time\" to write a reviw about people i dont even know that should say something.  JENNY LYNN great job!

    "text": "Let's face it... it's Buffalo Wild Wings which is pretty much standard when it comes to BWW food you'll find at any BWW. Visited this particular BWW about 5 times to visit with friends to watch some games. Been to several of them across the nation and honestly.... not my first choice of places to go in Las Vegas (or even in my top 20 places for that matter) with so many GREAT places to go.  Food isn't bad but nothing to rave about. Mixed drinks are pretty weak. Do anything more than your typical drafts and you'll be paying the price.  Never really worth reviewing this place in the past but the following incident earned this place a fantastic 2 star rating.  Met up with several people that love to go there to watch a game. Ended up at the bar and a couple of people were sitting at the bar next to us as we played the machines and we chit chatted a little. The girl I was with easily put over a couple of hundred dollars in the machines and I also put in some money and played. Ended up with a tab (yeah.. it's one of those places) which I paid. The people sitting next to us were also playing the machines and ended up leaving. Guess one of them did not pay their tab.  Right after they leave... I have a Bartender ask me in front of the lady I am with: \" Are you going to take care of his tab?\"  I asked him why that was my problem and he went off on me. Next thing he says is: \"I'm tired of you guys coming in and not tipping me\"... SERIOUSLY??? The few times I've been in there I've always tipped over 20% so I got a little upset to say the least.  But it gets better....  We leave to go somewhere else and then eventually end up at a bar down the street. Low and behold there are some employees wearing their BWW uniforms and one of them starts screaming and yelling at me across the bar that he's going to kick my a** and everything else because some person that I happened to talk to did not pay his tab and I was responsible for it???  What fun.....  Needless to say, I'll NEVER, EVER go back to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings. Too many other bars in Las Vegas to waste my time and money where the employees understand service and taking care of people. Especially customers that plop money into the machines.  I prefer to rave about good service / places but this negative review is certainly well deserved. Not just because of the above incident but from my experience, the bartenders there on swing shift seem to be miserable every time I've been there, rarely smile and their customer service skills are shoddy compared to other places I go.   Cheers!",

Unfortunately, the wait to be seated can take some time including the food. That's why, lately, we have opted to just order for take out to avoid waiting in line and too much noise.",

    "text": "We our huge fans of bdubs as my husband is a HUGE wing lover. So every state we have lived in we have frequented our neighborhood buffalo wild wings. But I have to say this location is hands down THE best! They are always accommodating even when they are packed. They usually have a lot of staff ensuring everything is quick.  Craig is by far the best server there. He will make sure you have a fresh drink before your glass is empty. He remembers everyones orders without writing them down and just has a positive friendly attitude. But all of the servers have been great, even during happy hour/sports games when they are swamped they do a great job with a smile on their face. Food always comes out hot and delicious, also appetizers come out on time. Just very efficient. I will not go to any other buffalo wild wings in Las Vegas. This is our favorite spot we go once or twice a week with our toddler and we all have a wonderful time.",

The place was not at all busy and we sat at a table in the half empty bar.  We sat there for 10-15 minutes and no one came over to take our drink orders, give us menus, or even acknowledge our presence.  We didn't even get an \"I'll be right with you.\"  After waiting for as long as we did and still thirsty and starving, we got up to leave.  On the way out I mentioned to the hostess who thanked us for coming that we were never even served.  She said she would tell a manager, but who knows if that happened.  Afterwards, we drove to Hooters and got excellent service and were served immediately.  The Buffalo wild wing server lost out on a big tip.  Next time serve your customers.",

The food was on point as always and came out pretty fast.  Food  Pretzels - 4 Stars - Nice & Soft and better with the Queso Dip Cheese Curds - 5 Stars - Tasted even better with the Marinara sauce. A very nice size portion.  WIngs - 4 Stars - Nice and Meaty - Could be cooked a hair longer to make them slightly more crispy.  Chicken Wrap - 4 Stars - Solid Dish  Cinnamon Squares - 4 Stars - Fine without the caramel sauce, but is awesome when you use the caramel sauce  Cheesecake Bites - 5 Stars - Nice and Creamy, full of flavor.",

Cashier (Cheryl?)did her best to apologize but she's hardly the one at fault. Very disappointing. 2 hours of failure.  Waited an extra 40 minutes so far for my online order to be complete. Offered drinks by the cashier during the wait but manager hasn't spoken to me once. Slight disappointment on an otherwise solid streak of service.",

This store is just terrible when it comes to customer service, ordering over the phone they are just terribly rude, they have gotten my order wrong 3 times now!! One time I had to wait an hour in the store to get my new order which I always get extra crispy wings, well I get home to find they were not, oh and when I actually went to get the manager to remind here after the hour of waiting she was surprised it had already been an hour and had totally forgot, I guess this could be because it was 12 am idk. The only time I seem to get good service here is when I come after work which is 7am and the bartender always gives great service! He is some ex army guy and always really cool and makes sure my order is correct I just don't know why I can't get the same service every time!!! And he is the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star review. This store needs to do way better",

That's at all of them, but that's the best part of going to buffalo wild wings, to sit down and enjoy a nice game with your buddies.

    "text": "Don't come here if you're looking to watch the UFC fights. I started visiting BWW when I lived in the Midwest, I'd go there to watch every UFC fight because they are one of the few places there (or here) that show the fights free.  My boyfriend and I went to this location a few weekends ago. We went to see the Rhonda Rousey fight on UFC. We knew we needed to get there early to get a seat so we showed up over an hour before the pay-per view started. There was a huge wait in the restaurant and I was told I could just go right back to the bar. Well, with the local UNLV basketball game on there wasn't an empty seat in the place. We spoke to a waitress who took our order and opened a tab for us, she told us she knew a few of her tables were not staying for the UFC fights so she'd make sure we got a seat. Well  in short that never happened. A table of hers did open up but when we tried to move there we were told that the manager said we couldn't, he was giving it to a couple who was 'on the list up front'. I was pretty upset because we'd been waiting nearly an hour at this point, the fights had started and when I'd gone up front they told me I didn't need to be on a list. The waitress told us that the manager promised he'd find us seats because she'd told him we'd been waiting. Well, needless to say it never happened.  After standing in a crowded bar for well over an hour one spot opened up at the bar so I was finally able to stand and my boyfriend had to continue standing behind me. Not exactly our idea of enjoying the fight. We were finally able to order food once I sat down, but we had to cash out our tab with the first waitress so she could move our tab to the bar. It was a hassle to have to pay and tip twice.  Sure it's nice to have no cover to watch the fights. But I'd rather pay a cover and be able to have a seat. Needless to say, we won't be coming here to watch the fights anymore.",

I used to love it, then I couldn't go anymore because of health reasons, then I finally went back in moderation and now I love it again.  There are a lot of dishes that could use makeovers, but I'm not here for fine dining, so I order a few select items and I stick to them. I almost always order wings (or \"boneless\" when I'm feeling lazy or don't want to get messy) and potato wedges with Cajun seasoning! Delicious, delicious, delicious. Actually, I only order one sauce now: Chipotle BBQ (well, it's a dry seasoning, but even better because I love seasonings more than sauces). When I'm in a saucy mood, I go for Hot BBQ or Honey BBQ. I've had most of the other sauces and seasonings and they're all good. The potato wedges are just soo good. The chive and onion seasoning and flavorful, crispy exterior creates delicious potatoes. They used to have the Cajun option on the menu, but have removed it for a few years, so just ask for it and they know. And trust me, the Cajun MAKES it the best fries (well, behind duck confit fries..and well, yeah you get the picture; it's not the very best, but it's darn good). Oh, and don't forget the vegetable boat and ranch dressing. Yum.  I'm sure everyone knows about Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Wing Thursdays (and late night happy hour as well?). My brother and I calculated it before and it's only worthwhile when you order a certain amount of wings and if you don't want the veggie boat or dressing/dip (since these are extra on those orders). I like those things, so the wing specials don't matter to me as much.  I've had my share of appetizers and other entrees and for the most part, they're tasty, but not amazing. I do not like their nachos, so I would avoid those if I were you. Also, not very Vegetarian-friendly here; even all their salads have meat, but I'm sure you can order them without the animals.  Oh, and they're open 24 hours. Can't complain!  EDIT (02/26/2013): Now you have the choice of traditional or boneless on Tuesdays and Thursdays don't have a special anymore. Also, I just noticed that they have a black bean burger as a protein option on their menu!! How exciting! And I almost swore them off for Vegetarian eats! I'll need to try that next time I'm here.",

The first time we had a bad experience, our appetizer (we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip) came out crusty from the top, as if it's been sitting there for a while. Today, as soon as we walked in we saw the employees, which I assumed were hosts sitting down in the waiting area because of how slow they were. We ordered the same appetizer today and the dip was definitely fresh this time but they gave us tortilla chips, which on the menu it says it comes with pita chips. Not a big deal, we ate them anyway. Our waitress, Christina, when we began to order our food gave us a dirty look as if we were inconveniencing her, she also didn't bother check up on us throughout our dining (keeping in mind that it's REALLY slow and there's probably only two other parties dining) and brought us refills AT THE END when we had already finished our food. We also ordered fries and we never got them, but we were charged for them! Obviously we told her and she apologized and said \"why didn't you tell me\", well it's kind of difficult to tell you if you didnt even bring us our food and you're no where to be visible nor check up on us. We went in on a Tuesday expecting to get the 1/2 traditional wings which is promoted on the BWWs website. When we got our bill we asked her about it and she told me \"well we don't do that here,\" and i told her that it's on the BWWs website and then called her manager over. The manager, very polite proceeded to tell me that the 1/2 traditional wings on Tuesday's is only for franchise stores and not for corporate stores. This is by far the worst experience and I do not recommend this location! Take the extra time and go to the one on hualapai, as they actually give you discounts and the service is MUCH better!",

My last visit was this past Thursday evening.  I was waiting for my friend in the bar and wanted to order a Ranger IPA.  I was told they didn't carry IPA on tap or bottled.....WTH?  The other location on North Durango & 215 has two IPA's on tap.....I was there 2 weeks ago, so I know they carry it.  I asked the waiter if they recently stopped selling IPA's and he said he didn't know and didn't even know what an IPA beer was!  I settled on a 24 oz Newcastle and put away 4 or 5 before the night was over.  Wow, I thought that BWW's were suppose to be consistent with their product.  I guess I was wrong.....whatever.  Will I come back?  Only when I come to visit my friend, otherwise I wouldn't come to this location.  There are better BWW's in Vegas.",

She had absolutely no care for anything that was going on. I told them my drink tasted bad and 8 minutes later she came back to me after walking past me multiple times and tells me that the soda I asked for was out, then the last 20 minutes of my meal My table and I didn't have a glass of water at all, she didn't even come to check on us while we were eating to see if we needed more water, and the restaurant wasn't even busy!!! completely did not care about her customers. And then to top it all off our bill was $36.50 and we gave her $37.00 and she never came back with the change and our receipt she kept it as if she earned it and we did not say she could have it. What kind of server has the audacity to keep the change and receipt without it being given to them!!! It was the most mind boggling thing I've ever seen done from a server, And then when we asked another server named Megan for the manager she looked at me as if I was stupid for asking. WORST service I've ever had at any place of business EVER! I will never be back to this location ever again, if I could rate 0 I would.",

We waited about 20 minutes for our food and received only 10 hot BBQ 5 honey BBQ and 5 buffalo. The guy that brought out our food asked us if it was the right order. I told him there should be 10 more buffalo. He look at the receipt confused and went and ordered the cooks for more.   15 minutes later the last 10 wings come out. This place automatically lost 4 stars from these set of wings. This set was NOT all flats. The ones that weren't flats were over cooked. I had a hard time eating them. Oh and they had NO buffalo rub at all. Good thing I asked for extra rub on the side, twice.  We also had to ask for our carrots because they didn't come out until we asked for them, which was half way through our meal. Btw we only received like 5 carrots haha.  Idk man. Bdubs had been sucking lately.   Medium = 15 but with bogo = 30 every bdubs I went to it seems like our servers don't know how to count. Oh well.

They have a lot of TV's everywhere all with different sports ranging from Basketball, Football, Soccer and a bunch more. For a chain restaurant like this, I don't really expect much. However Buffalo Wild Wings is an exception especially this one. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and you're bound to find something interesting like their buffalo chicken tender Mac n cheese, corn dogs, and even a chili queso dip. I love Chili and I love queso, so this is a match made in heaven for me. I've tried practically everything on their menu, but the one thing I always have to get is their fried pickles. The fried pickles are a bit spicy and come with either ranch or chipotle ranch. As for the entrees, there is so much food ranging from burgers, corn dogs, shrimp, wraps, and so much more. As for the service, I find that this location has way better service than the other ones I've been to. I wish I would've gotten the name of the person that seated us as when we left, my friend accidentally forgot to take her wallet with her and right as we were about to get into our car he came out running to tell us that we had left a wallet. Quality service with honest employees. This is why this Buffalo Wild Wings is my favorite location.",

And we were really craving wings ! Although I only crave American wings like once or twice a year.  Their happy hour starts from 2 pm-7 pm and 10 pm-2 am only on weekdays for appetizers and drinks. I like their mozzarella sticks for 4$. Imported and domestic draft beers go from 3-5$. On Tuesdays , their traditional wings are 60  each at this location. They charge extra for sauce.  I LOVE their \"Asian zing\" flavor. It's a must whenever I come here. However , I was really disappointed with the \"wild\" flavor. It's the second \"spiciest\" sauce on the menu BUT IT WAS NOT SPICY AT ALL. It was \"mild\" at best. I should've tried their \"reformulated blazin'\" sauce (apparently hottest sauce on the menu) but it's just one up from \"wild\" flavor , so I don't think it would be that spicy. Wingstop is better if you want spicy wings.  If they have their Tuesday/Thursday specials , then this is the place to go , but if it's not Tuesday/Thursday , I much prefer Wingstop for their food.",

I've been coming to buffalo wind winds now since they've been in Vegas, almost every location from galleria, all the way to sunset never have I had to check my own order before leaving. With that being said even though it's never my choice, randomly who I'm with is craving wings, sadly wing stop, canes and or anyone else is never conveniently located like the frozen Buffalo Wild Wings.

Although it can get pricey, since they don't have an actual happy hour, I do enjoy going in here to watch Kentucky basketball games with the other UK fans that frequent the bar. I usually take advantage of the Tuesday 45 cent wing nights. UFC fights are also fun to watch but you got to get there early to secure a spot because they have an awesome setup with many projector TVs and two separate zones for sound for watching and listening to sporting events.",

There are just two complaints I have about this particular location; (most) of the staff is SO rude and don't really have a concept of getting their job accomplished (the waitresses mostly) but also the girls who take orders at the front. My boyfriend and I have literally waited to be acknowledged for several minutes while three girl just stood LITERALLY 2 feet away talking and laughing we even said \"excuse me\" and they finished their conversations and then one of them came over. And when ordering take out you are told your food will be ready in 15-20 minutes, you arrive and the food is not ready ok, no big deal so you wait and when the food is ready it is ALWAYS 100% of the time wrong, and it's always different temperatures its like they make 1 thing first and let it sit and then make something else so by the time you pick up your food half of it is cold and half is blazing hot! Anyway I still go here cuz the food is good but they suck at their actual jobs.",

I went to school in Buffalo and Wild Wings is the closest you are going to get to the authentic \"wings\" you can get in good ole' western NY.   They have a great atmosphere, great staff, and great food. Sports buffs can be found crowding both the bar and the dining area during games as there are screens galore throughout.   I honestly like this location better than the one on Hualapai & Flamingo, even though this location is slightly smaller.  If your new to \"B-dubs\", they even have a scale of how hot/spicy their different sauces are. And, if you're not in the mood for wings - they have other stuff on the menu too (from salads to burgers to a variety of appetizers).  Don't forget about the \"seasonings\" for the wings too. Essentially dry rubs, there's salt and vinegar, chipotle BBQ, buffalo, and desert heat.   And now I'm hungry. Good thing they're open 24 hours a day!",

Perfect size, good amount of chicken and dressings, and the flavor was awesome! Not to mention $3 happy hour cocktails to top it off!   Plenty of TVs all over the restaurant so you can always catch a game in the bar or the dining area if you bring the family! They also have a pretty large selection of draught beers to choose from! Can't wait to return to try some more new things!",

This time they were made better and really layered with the cheese and not just heaped on top which was better than last time, the only downside was last time we had onion dip and this time we had a honey bbq type thing. Definitely ask for onion dip because it makes it WAY better. Lemon pepper wings were good but the Parmesan garlic seem to always be covered in sauce. Either way it was good food and the service was good. Also all the tvs keep kids of all ages entertained which is always nice.  Overall we keep coming back because the service and the food are consistent and good.",

Ambiance is decent and there's plenty of seating and TV screens around showing all types of sporting events. They also get bonus points for being  having the entire restaurant Nonsmoking .. (rare in Vegas).  They also serve my favorite 'beerish' drink...Pear Cider. Yes, I'm a weenie and I enjoy cider.  Also, they offer 60 cent per wing ( boneless or bone-in) on Tuesdays..

I usually order ranch sauce with my fries and the waitress did not \"go over\" my order to make sure I got everything I paid for (since it's their policy). They did not put ranch sauce in my bag and I only realized it wasn't there when I came home. Btw they DO charge for ranch sauce.  Another time, I ordered 6 bourbon honey mustard wings and I only got 5 wings instead of 6. I know these complaints may seem minor but the second time around did not make me change my mind about their customer service!!! Also some of the staff at the front were not familiar with the lunch club punch cards. (Since I wanted a punch card, I had to explain what it is). I am absolutely disappointed with this location and it's even near my house too!!!!!",

She knew what she was talking about, when she wasn't sure about something she went to ask for the info for you immediately. Friendly and talkative to us, which I appreciate bc some servers couldn't care less about their customers.  I'd like to say thank you to Linnea, if you are reading this. We really appreciated your great customer service.  We came on a Saturday which I thought was gonna be busy today but since football is over, not a lot of ppl is here.

Buffalo chips that are as bland and boring as cardboard? Chicken wings that do not impress at all? Ummmm NO thanks.   They don't offer family packs or combos either so that's another downside for me. My husband raved once on how good the Garlic Parmesan wings are so I figured why not try BWW for a change, such poor decision making on my end! Lol. It wasn't that bad but definitely not something I would crave. Lemon Pepper wings hold nothing compared to Wingstop's.  I'm sure it's a fun place to hang out at and enjoy watching your favorite sports games, but I just don't think it's enough to make me wanna come back knowing the food is laughable. There's a reason why my patronage remains with the competition.",

    "text": "I've only been to this location once and most likely it will be the last. I'll stick to the one I normally go to by the south outlets.. I had been craving wings for a few days now, and it was late. Most places were closed, so we decided to stop by this location. Which I'm a bit embarrassed to admit, but I didn't really even know this location existed lol..  We were getting the food to go. When entering we waited about 5mins before anyone greeted us. There were a couple of employees sitting in a booth. I guess it gave us time to look over the menu. The place was empty, except for one or two customers at the bar.  Once we were ready, which was instantly, we kinda already knew what we wanted lol.. I asked the young lady if the spinach artichoke dip was still served with pita chips instead of the tortilla chips. Because some locations still do it and since I had never been to this one, I wanted to make sure before ordering it. If they no longer did it, then I wasn't going to order it. No big deal. She wasn't sure at first and then she said yes. So then I asked her if she was sure and she replied yes again! So I went ahead and ordered it. We also ordered some wings and a salad.  We decided to wait for our food at the bar, figured we'd have a drink while waiting. As I sat down my friend went to the restroom, there were about three people behind the bar. After 5mins or so my friend comes back from the restroom and not one \"bartender\" had approached me or even acknowledged that i was there. I tried grabbing their attention a couple of times but I guess they were too busy.. when the bartender approached me and asked if we wanted anything, our food was already ready so we didn't get a drink..  I knew I should have checked the food before leaving but I was already a bit irritated so we just left. When we got home, I went straight for the dip since my mouth was watering just thinking about it. When I opened it, I wasn't even surprised that they messed up! Smh, they gave me tortilla chips instead of the pita chips that I specifically asked for! And to top it off the dip wasn't that great! (yes we still ate it) the wings were delicious and so was the salad.   But the service, for a bww establishment is not that great! I will stick to my original location..",

They have a nice selection of different flavors which is nice.   Sometimes the food is fresh and sometimes it tastes like it's literally been sitting under the warmer for hours. It is a hit or a miss with the amount of traffic that is present at the time you actually go.   I usually get the honey bbq bone in wings and my husband loves spicy so he gets the mango habanero. Occasionally, he gets a burger, I believe it's the jalapeno burger.",

The food is great, there is something to watch, there are tablets for my kids to play on for entertainment, and the food is fresh and hot every single time.

My rating was lowered this time because my server, Luis, as kind and friendly as he was, forgot to redeem my reward from my bill and I had to pay an extra $9 for my lunch break. The Blazin Rewards is a benefit to those that are at BDubs a lot and get rewarded for doing so. But I told Luis I had a coupon, he even took my number down so I could redeem it, but he didn't redeem it.

The style of wing you want, how you want it cooked, and how you want it sauced. I simply love the atmosphere. Playing our own music, watching sports, playing trivia, and enjoying family time. Shayan is the absolute best server. I try to come when he's working, not only does he remember who we are but knows how we order our favorites. Im sure he deals with hundreds of people a week but regardless if its a week or 2 months since we've visited he remembers. This place gets busy. I'm Amazed at the reviews and how people expect 5 star cuisine from a neighborhood wing place that gets busy! Where are these people on the off season from sports or special events? There have been times a where things just aren't right and the managers have always taken care of us. I love the Blazin rewards program. If I'm going to spend money on food, it's nice to get a little kick back.   Congratulations Shayan for making shift manager!!! Its very much deserved. We thank you for being the best server we've ever had and wish you the best!",

The TV's outside are a little high, IMO, so you're constantly craning your neck up unless you're standing up. Also, it was freezing and I guess their heat lamps died.    On the plus side, they do not charge cover for the fight, which is rare.  I guess beggers can't be choosers.  We had to go inside and order drinks at the bar as the wait staff was completely swamped.

Been coming here ever since they opened (6-7 years ago?) because our house is just around the corner, and it's always been a great experience.  So no, their food isn't French Laundry, it's just wings and other bar foods.  But I'm going to give it 5-stars based on one thing - the Mango Habanero wings!  I've had this at other BW3s before, but they're not 5-star-worthy.  This one is.  Mango-y but not too sweet, big time habanero that is fiery hot and does justice to this sauce being the 3rd hottest out of the 1000 sauces they have.  I'm just scared for #1 & 2...  The other sauces are also great (maybe not 5-star worthy), and their burgers are really good as well which was a pleasant surprise.  Service is great all-around, especially the pretty sweetheart at front.  And this place is just hopping all the time with great vibe and lots of TVs.  Just such a fun place, if you can get a seat!  So 4-star value on the food except the 5-star Mango Habanero, at least 4-star service and a can't-fail 5-star enjoyment all rolled into a place walking distance from the house.  How can you go wrong?  Table-for-1 Factor:  So there is a downside, you probably can't enjoy all this if you're alone unless you're willing to take a chance on walking in by yourself.  Awkward...",

    "text": "Great place for the big games, went for march madness. Service was great as usual at the bar. Love the selection of games and brewskis. If you want the sound to a particular game they have no prob switching it or polling the crowd on which game to listen to. I catch this place on tues or thurs when they have wing/boneless specials, wanna say happy hour is 4-7 pm. The wings are usually just a tad too breaded with less meat, this time it was a perfect combo but the last two times they were less saucy than a Mormon Christmas party, other than that a great game/dining experience. Kimberly is the best bartender at a busy bar you could ask for. Only knocking it a tad cause wings are in the name so you should have those down pat. 3 out of 5 this time.",

I like what the business does and they usually do it pretty well. However, as happens when you employ actual people, one of them made an honest mistake and put meat on my wife's nachos. Which we didn't discover until I had returned home.  I called them back and relayed the problem (we have dead animal on this stuff. We specifically asked for no delicious animal murder on these chips) and they offered us free food. We said we didn't want free food we just would like an exchange please. The nachos we recieved looked like the menu. You know how food never looks as good as it does on the menu? These looked like Mario Batali plated our Bdubs nachos. They also *forced* chocolate cake on us. The manager personally apologized. All of this highly unnecessary but very appreciated.  I have come away impressed every time I've eaten here. The beer list is great (this varies from Bdubs to Bdubs) the service is good. The only bad thing is they get full during big UFC events. Completely reasonable.  Highly recommended.",

Bar area is huge too,understandly. Clean and organized. This place is almost always packed, day or night. TV everywhere! Kids are not forgotten here,they have games to play with. Never had a problem with any servers. They are very attentive and some of them has good tips on fantasy draft lol.  I like the wings here better than hooters. If only BWW will add clam chowder to their menu, that'll be awesome!  I love the new dry rubs, less messier. Please add mango habanero dry rubs  Will always keep coming back.",

I mean, you can't go wrong with beer, but I was very disappointed when they stopped making jalapeno poppers.  We visited this location a few days ago and ordered the teriyaki wings and a Greek salad.  The wings were just okay, but the flavor seemed to have changed.  My Greek salad was absolutely inedible. I expected real chicken slices, but what I received was a soy product made to look like chicken.  I ate all the green leafy but threw out the \"chicken\".  I'm sorry BBWW, we will not be returning to this location anytime soon.",

Full Disclosure: It touts itself as an unofficial University of Kentucky bar so I am predisposed to love it.  Setting that little fact aside, the traditional and boneless wings are consistently hot which can be an issue at BWW.  The servers are very nice and generally on top of things and I like the fact that the bar and dining area are connected.    Anyone who says BWW doesn't have the best selection and flavors for sauce is out of their mind or really just a big fat liar.  In either case, I wouldn't take their advice.  This location is a really open space and a great spot to watch your favorite team.  Go Cats!",

Anyways, this location is a decent size. The service is \"on point\" though. They are usually very quick on seating you. Just like all the other reviews - BWW is the perfect place to watch your sports shows. It gets really packed and full of energy during college basketball season, especially when the Rebels are playing.  My go-to order is a toss up between the honey bbq, chicken parmesan, and mild wings. I almost always have to get a regular order of french fries or potatoe wedges with cheese. It's a must in my book anyways. They have a good drink menu. I love their bahama mama - its the perfect fruity drink for me.  To sum it up, if you're craving wings and are on the west side. Don't forget to hit this location up.  Tip: Try to go on a Tuesday or Thursday for their discount price on traditional and boneless wings. If you like traditional go on Tuesday and if you're a fan of boneless go on Thursday.",

They have since added to their flavor repertoire and I must say it is impressive.   Do not deny yourself some buffalo chips with cheese, whatever flavor wings you decide to order.   We hit the bar for a while after we ate and the service was great. All of the staff were pleasant, consistent, and clean (a must for me).  It wasn't too busy when we went although I've been told that it does get packed in there at times.   Thanks guys!",

That was only about 4 or 5 years ago. The price just seems to keep rising.   I read that they offered an happy hour. I was unsure of what the time, and I asked when there hh was over. The server said, I don't know what time it is. uh.... okay. HH is 3-7. The appetizers include mozzarella sticks, onion rings, roasted garlic deep fried mushrooms among other things.   They also have a limit of 20 guaranteed flats per table. The wings tasted normal. The service was okay. Nothing exceptional. She did check up on his a few times. Before I got there, my friends wanted to try the buttery maple flavor. Another server brought us a sample of the sauce with fries to dip it in. The fries were awesome, not the flavor though.   Nothing special about my visit and nothing special about the visit. Slight irritation about my hh question. Isn't point to promote business?",

I also appreciated the fact that they gave you the sesame dressing on the side and let you control how much you want.  Drinks were filled quickly each and every time.  We actually joked because when were talking to friends the waitress startled everyone.  One second, their drinks were low. The next second their drinks were full!

    "text": "This review is strictly in regards to a red headed bartender working tonight. I was sitting at the bar with my friends, when two men walked in and sat on the other side of the bar from us. There were plenty of seats, surprisingly it was not busy. About 30 minutes after I sat down is when they walked in. One of them wanted my seat in particular. They informed the bartender, who very rudely kicked me out of my seat. Had she asked nicely, or had they asked them fine. Unfortunately she kicked me out of my seat. Kicked me out. Now, again, there were plenty of seats and it was not busy. It was simply the manner with which she handled the situation. I asked if I could go to my table, which previously she had said she would transfer my tab once our other friends arrived. She said yes, but then made me close out my tab with her. I had specifically asked if it could be transferred. I am not sure why she forced me out of my seat or why she then decided not to transfer my tab, but her service was horrendous. I have never not tipped in my life, but she got nothing from me. If she is on duty next time I am there, I will be asking for someone else and I will not be tipping her again!!  To the waiter at our table, you were terrific and that is why I tipped you 35%. This review has nothing to do with our waiter. Only that horrendous bartender.",

It went from a colorful trifold to a dull looking medical chart. I also noticed the plates were different; they got rid of the yellow boats and changed it to steel pans with parchment paper. The workers now wear dull t-shirts, no more jersey. Overall the change looks cheap and dull. They got rid of the spinach dip and garlic mushrooms (which is our fave)! Sad to say, the new management/owners made a bad change. Hopefully they don't change more of bdubs.",

Melissa, goes above and beyond! She's like a mother hen. This time around I had a margarita at which we felt like there was more ice then there was margarita. Melissa had realized how quickly I finished my drink and asked if I wanted another (thinking at this point she probably thinks I'm a huge alcoholic) but we told her no kindly and my husband made a comment on how the bartender seemed to of ripped our drink off with over icing the margarita glass. She came back to our table and told us the manager is getting me a new margarita cuz that isn't right lol. Shes very attentive and truly cares for her customers. She's amazing she deserves a raise!! Ask for Melissa u will enjoy her service!",

Upon arrival, my order was not quite ready... which was fine. However, when it was ready... I had them go over the order. As they opened each box, 2 out of 3 were not extra wet. The lady who went over the order agreed that they seemed like they needed a bit more sauce. She said she would take them back to have sauce added.   When she returned, she opened each box and we were both in SHOCK at the amount of EXTRA sauce was added. The wings were practically swimming in the sauce. (See picture - wings removed from the sauce to show the excess)  She sincerely apologized... \"I'm sorry, I am not sure why they did that.\" Was her response.   Unfortunately, I had my family in the car and we had waited long enough. If I had the time, I would have brought this to the managers attention, as it looked intentional and malicious.  Thus, my review and my rating.",

I waited about five min to get my order. She told me she would go over my order once it's ready but she didn't.  I should've insisted on going over the order because the quality of food was way below bad. The wings were mostly bread and little chicken. They were over cooked. And the worst part was it had very little to no sauce. One of the Parmesan Garlic box that I got had almost no sauce it in that it was like eating chicken nuggets. It was so dry.  I do not recommend coming to this place. Maybe try a different Buffalo Wild Wings.",

This was our first time at think location. It had the highest ratings so we thought we would try it. The wings are far better than any other Buffalo Wild Wings. There was so much sauce it was nearly dripping.  My hubby was pretty annoyed upon entering. I got to tell you it's pretty hard to upset this guy. The girls took a very long time to acknowledge us then they asked us if we're picking up or placing a to-go order. That was a pretty weird question. We replied saying no that we would like to be seated.  Our waiter was good. He took our drink orders and they came immediately. But it took him way too long for him to get back to us. I got to tell you as soon as he walked away with our order our food came! It was wonderful!  We left the happiest people! It was a delicious meal and a perfect evening!  It would have been a five star but the entrance to the night can not be forgotten. The girls appearing as air-head idiots that would rather stand together talking among themselves.  I recommend you don't leave without the Thia Curry! We also had Thai Ginger and it was a bit sweeter than I would have expected but excellent all the same. Happy for use it was happy hour! Michelob Ultra for us!",

I placed my order on the website at 5:04pm and it quoted me a pick up time of 6:40pm.  Normally I would say 90 mins is a bit absurd for pick up, but again, super bowl Sunday.  When I went to pick up the food, it was room temperature cold.  The ticket on my bag said that I was made at 5:14pm, essentially sitting out there for one hour.  They also had the \"Your Order Was Reviewed By\" sticker with the checkboxes and of course none of that was filled out.    They did ask for my phone number and email address when I ordered online, so they could have at least called and said that the online wait time was over an hour off... or at least cooked my food at the appropriate time so that it's not sitting out there.",

Couldn't even get her name cuz she talks so fast I couldn't catch it.  And this situation has happened more then once when calling in to do a pick up order.  Maybe only go if you decide to dine inside.  But don't waste your time trying to do a to go order. Tried a time to call in a order and was missing my celery/carrots I had paid extra for.

    "text": "Great local bar with a fantastic tap beer list. The bar tenders are service oriented and do their job well. No long waits on a refill or even the first beer. Food is already world famous so no need to say much. 2 for Tuesday is a great deal for the boneless wings and a very nice happy hour menu is also available. After 10pm so take advantage of the late happy hour for all people in the service industry or anyone who gets out late. The music is always upbeat at the place and the TVs are outstanding. Large screen plus many enormous projection screens. The machines tend to be a little tight for gamblers but at least you will get your drinks comped if you play. Support this great place as it is open 24/7. Thanks for the great service and food.",

Way better service plus quality of food.. Everyone was very friendly and attentive.. Wings were not drenched in sauce & crispy how we requested.. Other location doesn't  bother to reply to request: just bring out whatever way..Lunch menu is perfect for two people to share.. Happy hour is great but noticed lunch is just the same! This location rocks & worth the drive! Bloody Mary & draft beer had an ok price for lunch ... 5 STARS",

You get seated quickly, and it's not bad service, but I think general, we did the bottomless boneless wings, and they took at least 20-30 minutes to get us the refills.  Similar type of service for drinks (less than the 30 minutes, but it's a wait).  I can't say that I care a lot about the service during the work week.  Great food.  Hopefully service is better, since we come to this location quite a bit for lunch.",

    "text": "How do you screw up an online to go order that is clearly written out for you? I don't get it. Tonight, I ordered the Boneless Large with 3 sauces: Mild, Spicy Garlic and Lemon Pepper. The mild and Spicy garlic I asked for EXTRA WET. Anyway, I get there, my order comes out to be $20.54 and I tip 20%. My mistake. The girl at the front brings out my order and quickly goes over it. After the 2nd box, I stop her when she says \"Honey BBQ.\" No big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. She goes to the back and gets my Lemon Pepper wings. And I head out after she mentioned the Mild. I sit in my car and go through the bag and realize the first box was Medium. I asked for Spicy Garlic as my 3rd choice. So I take my daughter back out of her seat and head back inside. I tell her I'm missing the Spicy Garlic and she goes back in the kitchen and brings them out. I guess the main reason why I'm so bothered is not because they messed up the order really, even though my bag had a receipt with the exact sauces I asked for. I'm more bothered at the fact that the boxes they gave me were disgusting. It seemed as if the cooks mixed the sauce and wings with their hands and then put them in the box and closed the boxes with their dirty hands. I also asked for EXTRA WET and I did not get that AT ALL. Overall it was a very unpleasant experience. To go boxes should be clean and presentable.",

The problem is that your restaurant and maybe Bdubs as a whole doesn't use warmers. This makes fries and wing breading rather distasteful and soggy. I will likely avoid pickup in the future which will lead to less visits to your establishment.",

So if you have a random craving for an assortment of chicken wings, you can swing by at any time!  -As with most places in Vegas - there are video poker machines at the bar. They have keno as well!  -There is a pretty sweet happy hour! Mon - Fri 4-7p, (select) $3 appetizers, $3 drafts, $3 Jack, Captain,  or Absolut drinks... I do believe there is another alcohol listed, but I can't remember right now :(   Other than that, if you've been to one B-Dubs, you've been to them all. I just can't emphasize enough how great the service is here though - it truly is a neighborhood bar.",

I have tried soooo many other wing places in the area, but there's just something about the bdubs wings man.. i'm literally addicted haha  I have dined in and ordered pick up many times and I personally prefer dining in because the food is always fresh, but sometimes, eating out ain't the move chief.   So you might be thinking, \"O, if you love bdubs so much, then why'd you give it 4/5 stars?\" Well i'll tell ya !  The only complaint I have is sometimes, JUST SOMETIMES, when I order for pick up, the food is cold.. OUCH that was hard to say. Of course if I show up an hour after the pick up time, the wings will be cold, but I always show up right on time, or maybe a little before, and I have run into the cold wing ordeal. Personally, I don't mind THAT much cuz the wings are just so good, but I understand how this can be a big no-no for some people. So make sure to arrive a little before the pick up time to minimize your chance of getting cold chickens :)  I don't understand why this specific bdubs has a lower rating though because customer service is usually people's #1 complaint, but i've never run into that problem soooo ..:)   p.s. if you've never had bdubs before, get honey bbq!!!!!! literally the best ever",

    "text": "This was a mediocre experience and I'm not sure if that was because we went at lunch hour.   We were looking for somewhere to eat and rarely are off on Mondays and I had remembered I had a gift card so we figured we'd stop here. We were seated almost immediately and then our waitress informed us she would be with us shortly. She did come and take our drink order and politely informed me that my strawberry lemonade wouldn't be refills (which I appreciated).  Then for our food - I had the chicken wrap off the lunch menu and my boyfriend had the naked tenders. Our food took the longest I think I've ever experienced at a BWW, and again I am thinking it had more to do with how busy it was for lunch and that the lunch hour is less predictable then during busy sporting hours! Once our food came how it was exactly what we ordered and let me tell you, we were definitely hungry by that point. Our drinks did run out (we each had two) but our waitress did notice once we put them on the end of the table.  Also, when we went to pay I was told the type of gift card I was gave them trouble - which was awkward and weird to hear.",

It's located on the corner of Durango and Warm Springs.  It's easy to spot their sign that faces Warm Springs.  The bar area is spacious with TV viewing from very angle.  This helped since March Madness happened to be going on.     Little did we know it was their happy hour time.  The drinks were reasonable.  We also shared the Ultimate Nachos which came on a very large tray.  For only $4 HH price, I was shocked.  The cheese, fresh jalapeno, chili, diced tomatoes and sour cream made for a delightful app.  We opted to add some grilled chicken to make us even happier.    Our service was good since our drinks were always brought immediately.  He came around frequently to check on us which is always appreciated.  Thanks to BDubs for a short and sweet visit.",

But if you plan on dining, drinking, gaming, etc. DO NOT EVER waste a moment of your time. I sat for 11 minutes being passed by and by with not one greeting or an interest in my order. Believe it or not, that was the least of poor service. It continued to being ignored, machines breaking and not being taken care of respectfully or efficiently when left at a broken machine, no drinks, and absolutely no customer service. Of course, the \"Red Head\" bartender didn't have a name tag, or her name would be mentions very clearly.. A call to the manager will be made tonight, because that was simply and completely unacceptable. She should have no business being employed with any hospitality means. Also shows a huge lack of management for not handling the restaurant and employee's issues. Better off spending money and your time elsewhere.",

The service from the bar was overall good, the bartender was on top of it but failed to mention it was happy hour and the beer specials of the month.  We ordered the bone in wings (dry) w/ sauces on the sides. The wings were mediocre and on the dryer side, I recommend getting it off the fryer for extra freshness!! For me personally what makes this place are the sauces. Mmmmmmmmm... that garlic parmesan and hot bbq! And if you like to sweat your face off! Try the mango habanero, its literally the best of both worlds. Spicy but tastey! This location isn't bad but needs improvement.",

I take a seat and hop on my phone while I waited. I realize its now 5:20pm so I ask for a status update on my order. I'm brought out my order and was informed they were waiting for the fries to be done.  A bit frustrated for what seemed to be an unusually long wait time, I take my order and head to my car. Now, I dont normally check every single item in my to-go order but before I pulled out of my parking space, a little voice in my head told me to do just that. To my discovery, a part of my order was missing!   At that point, I lost all patience for this establishment. I grabbed the rest of my order and left.   Taking an extra 20min to fulfill my to-go order, I'd like to think accuracy would've been addressed.

Customer Service: 5/5 My server Tony was exceptional in every aspect.  From his friendliness to his attention to details to his demeanor. He is definitely an asset to this particular location.  Atmosphere: 5/5 I like to sit at the bar, even though I don't drink cause I love the loud crazy rock N roll music. If you don't, then not so much five stars, since I am rating this review and I love it, it's a FIVE stars from me.  In addition, I like the room temperature too.  Quality: 5/5 Man, the mango habanero traditional wings, chicken sandwich and beer battered onion rings are my easiest FIVE stars to give.  Not many places have beer battered onion rings these days and if they do, they're not like these. Yummy!  Cleanliness: 5/5 They may not be immaculate, so why do I rate it FIVE stars?  Cause I know how hard it is to maintain such sanitary place when you serve such messy foods and sauces.  This place still manages to keep it this clean, that's a KUDOS FIVE stars for these staff.  Price: 5/5 Once again, price doesn't matter when you get exceptional food and service in the same place.   Tips: They can get pretty busy, so be patience, it's worth it. I find myself having to wait at every Buffalo Wings, but this one is actually not too bad in comparison.  I am use to wait for over an hour in CA locations.  One of the best perks here is that they are open 24/7. Yip, I sometimes crave it at 2 a.m. and I will seriously stop by.",

    "text": "This is mostly concerning the drink comping policy for gamblers.  I was at the bar playing video poker and a girl sits next to me, puts in $20, and orders a drink. She was playing for a while and was up an additional $20 when she ordered a second drink.   The bartender proceeds to explain that since she only put in $20 she can't comp another drink. The girl politely protests and explains that she has been playing and intends to play more. I backed the girl up and stated that she had been playing the whole time. The bartender, with a look of frustration on her face, reiterates and further explains that comping is not based on your play but how much you initially put in... 1 drink per $20.   The girl who was gambling asked if she can cash out and put 20 dollars of her winnings back in to get another drink. The bartender says no. This goes back and forth for a bit. I almost felt a little embarrassed for the bartender. She looked as if she would have preferred to just give the girl another drink but also said that the managers really keep an eye on them! Yeah, you wouldn't want to give a gambler a drink that costs you about a buck! Good Managing!  The whole idea of giving gamblers free drinks is to keep them playing, keep them pushing those buttons... especially if they're winning! You want them to put it back, right?  Duh!     As I was leaving I noticed the girl was now up over $100. I can only hope she cashed out and didn't give it back.  I had a similar situation 2 months ago at the BWW on LV Blvd only I wasn't informed of the comping policy as I ordered my 2nd and 3rd beer. I cash out 20 bucks ahead and the bartender brings me a bill for $15 for those beers. I think the real policy at BWW is \"If you are losing they will comp you, if you are winning they try and get some of the money back by charging you.\"  Sally Smith, the CEO of BWW, who made 3.9 million in 2014, was recently quoted as saying that BWW would be raising beer prices yet again. Uhhh! Geez!  Overpriced Beer and Wings and a tight-ass comping policy for players...Too Corporate! I think it's time to find a new place. Fortunately, there's a bar on every corner in Vegas!",

I emailed the general manager Brad a couple days prior and requested for a couple tables to be reserved. You never know if it is going to be packed in the bar area or not so I wanted to be on the safe side.   A manager called and also emailed to confirm my request, and when I got there they moved a couple of tables together to accommodate us.   Our server Wes was very attentive and friendly. We got to enjoy their nice happy hour menu of $3 Jack Daniels/Captain Morgans/Absolute, plus $3 select appetizers. My favorite new appetizer is their soft pretzels with nacho cheese sauce.   Lots of big screen TVs and NTN trivia which are pluses. Overall a great experience. My only complaint is that they don't have the sound boxes if you want to watch another game with sound.",

This is the worst way to lure your customer into your business. The worst part was when I tell the manager, he shrugged and kept watching his football game and not give a damn. Well he did offer the first 2 drinks @ happy hour price and that was it. Instead of instructing his employees about the happy hour instructions, he kept on watching his football game.",

    "text": "This review is long over-due for me. I've been to this BWW so many times since I moved here that I've lost count. I usually try to go during Happy hour/Tuesdays to fully enjoy myself.   Starting off with appetizers they have a good variety to choose from (Mozzarella sticks/Chips & Salsa/Onion Rings etc) for only $3 during happy hour as well as $3-5 for Imported & Domestic draft beers. Traditional Wings on Tuesdays they charge 60 Per wing.  Bar - (Can't have wings without a cold one) For beer selections, they have a great variety of beers to choose from. From Stella Artois to Angry Orchard and some good ol' Samuel Adams.   Any Variation of BBQ (Sweet/Hot/Honey/Chipotle/Korean BBQ) - I really find the BBQ flavors here to be really bland and lackluster, they really don't impress compared to other places such as wingstop where the BBQ is savory and just overall delicious, definitely won't be ordering them any time soon  Hot Wings (Mild/Medium/Hot/Buffalo) - As far as wings go, these are the ones you HAVE to order, From my experiences in Vegas every sauce that i've tried so far is either too salty, hot, bland, sweet, or vinegary. The sauce should be tangy with a nice vinegar hit, taste rich of butter, and of course have heat BWW hits this perfectly and I couldn't be more pleased.  The main problem that I've had with Buffalo wild wings is just inconsistency in every aspect. The service is either out of this world or straight up awful. As for the wings they could have the perfect amount of sauce and great taste, drowned in sauce and ruin your meal, or they could have no sauce at all and leave you disappointed.   But as long as they keep Happy hour and Tuesday specials, i will be coming back as much as I can!",

While my husband was changing out the tire a crew member came out with a cold bottle of water and said something like \"I can see you're having a bad day..here you go!\" when asked what his name was he introduced himself as Jeff, the manager.   If the manager is as stand up as this with non patrons, imagine the service you get when you visit this BWW!! :)  We will definitely be stopping in soon!  Thanks so much Jeff!",

    "text": "The food is ok, nothing special. The service is inconsistent, and the manager is useless.  If you find yourself at this location against your better judgment ask for Katrina. If you like your wings on the crispy side, you'll have to ask for this as they tend to come slightly undercooked (i.e., soft skinned). I forgot to ask, so I was slightly disappointed with my wings.  The best flavors of wing sauces are the Jamin Jalapeno and Spicy Garlic.  I have attempted to eat at this location twice before. Yesterday, I managed to stay without leaving before I was served. Even so, I experienced the same problem at the hostess stand as I had two times previously.  There seems to exist a fundamental problem with the manner in which guests are handled when they enter this BBW location.  Unlike most BBW locations that seem to have a half-dozen teenage girls/boys at the front podium, this location tends to have one or two. Everyone else seems to be hiding in the back - I guess. If the hostess is in the middle of taking a take-out order, you could wait for a very long time without so much as a greeting. I consider waiting without a greeting or acknowledgement to be problematic after about 4-5 minutes because it only takes a second to tell a guest you'll be right with them.  Since my friend selected the location with a strong desire to have wings and a cold beer, I agreed to give the place another try. Thankfully, our server Katrina saved the day. She was very pleasant, attentive, and accommodating.  Although the food did not meet with my quality standards, the service and my cold Angry Orchard ciders on tap did. Couple this with some great company, and the venue worked out to my liking.  Ironically, the poor greeting turned into a rather red carpet exit when two staff members sent us off with a pleasant good-bye and grabbed the door for both of us on the way out. Upon quickly comparing my greeting, it felt a little surreal. Although I am not looking for a red carpet entrance, guest should be welcomed and feel like a valued guest when they enter.",

Great Happy hour specials from 10pm-6am with $3 beers and $4 apps.  I've been here a few times in the past, once to a funny/horrible story.  Because everything was handled with such professionalism and grace I'll tell you about it.    It was approximately a month ago I ordered some boneless Sweet BBQ wings.  In case you've never entered a BWW in your life, Sweet BBQ ranks number 1 out of 28 sauces.  28 being hotter then the sun!  After my first wing my eyes started to tear up.  My server assured me the wings were correct and I continued eating.  After 3 wings I literally broke into a sweat, and told him something was wrong.  The manager came over and took the food back.  When he returned with my new freshly made sweet BBQ he said aloud, \"Those must have been in the frier with the Jalapeno wings.\"  He apologized profusely and comped my meal.  Everything was handled professionally and with grace.  Tonight I came back to say hello and Shane remembered my face.  It's great to come back to an establishment where people remember you.  See you again soon BWW!",

They have messed up our to go orders multiple times in the last month.   First time they forgot my wings completely. The whole order was missing.  More time missed off the clock running around during a work day. Had to drive back to get what we paid for  Second time they almost gave us one order for free but being the kind hearted honest hard working type we told them they had to charge us for one of the orders. This comes with after waiting for 20 minutes to get wings we ordered 30 minutes prior online for pickup. They stated that one of their cooks did not show up for work or called out.  Tonight was the last straw though. We ordered online again and I wanted dry rub on the side of my salt and vinegar order. I ordered garlic parm as they put that sauce on the side as well despite the clarification made in the ticket under the notes field on the website. Anyhow.... I also chose to get one Bleu cheese with my take out in which I did not get. All and all....  I am just tired of the complete lack of paying attention to small details. I am not sure how they have such a high ratings here but I am convinced and I will not eat here again just because of the amount of mistakes that happen over and over. I do not like paying for things and not receive them,",

(Edit:  Now corp owned, the drink selection has shrank)   The food normally comes out quickly.  I tried to work my way up the heat scale and got almost to the top.  However, my efforts were wasted one night when I drank too much and had spicy chicken sitting in my beer filled gut all night.  Let's just say that my esophagus has never been the same.  That pretty much ended my spicy food career.  On some nights the music gets a bit loud and you have to yell at your buddies to converse.

I mean who doesn't like wings w/ a HUGE variety of dipping sauces? Sometimes a few brewskis and some wings is JUST what hits the spot.  So get your nose out of the air and go get some wings!",

The habanero sauce was good, but a bit too heavy on the habanero flavor.  High ceilings, clean tables, good service.  If you like sports its a good place because thats all they had on their tvs. No news on though. Had some sort electronic trivia game too where you can compete against other customers.  I'll be going back.",

Tuesdays are $0.45 bone in wings, and Thursdays are $0.60 boneless wings.  You go in, you tell them how many wings you want, and then you specify what sauce you want your wings to have.  Ranch costs extra.  The food is good bar food, but one day you may go and have your wings drenched in delicious sauce, while another day you could stop in and have dry spots on your wings.  Service is always just okay, what I'd expect from a bar.  Want wings?  Is it Tuesday/Thursday?  Then stop by!  I haven't been early enough, but I believe happy hour is from 5:00-7:00.  Open 24 hours.",

The variety of sauces are pretty good. This may be the only thing that redeems this place. Everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food. For the price...not worth it for me . Just buy your favorite  sauces and cook your own wings at home.",

Ordered the roasted garlic mushrooms... Since when is a roasted mushroom fried!?!?!? Next, tried to order a Batch 19 draft (from the beer menu)... Oops, we don't carry that.

BUT today, the service we had was just terrible. Beth, our server, was atrocious. There was a time when we almost asked her if she was trying to get off work, because that's how extremely rushed and uncomfortable she was making us feel. There was even a time when she came by and actually asked if the check was ok, when we told her we were alright and didn't need anything at that moment. (Mind you our drinks were still half full and we were all in a fun conversation just chit chatting and enjoying ourselves). It was just unbelievable. Of course I will be returning to BWW, but if she's ever my server again, I will be promptly and politely asking for another.",

Great establishment.  1 star = for the massive number of TVs they have in the bar, including some huge displays for the big games of the day.  They are willing to seat you near the TV that is playing the game you are interesting in watching.  They are also willing to change the channel for you if the current ones playing aren't of interest.  2 stars = for their selection of drinks.  They offered us green colored beer on St. Patty's day too!  3 stars = for the food!  Besides their wings, they offer quite a selection.  All of their appetizers are awesome.  Make sure to have their soft pretzels; the cheese sauce is amazing and has kind of a curry or cumin kick to it.  Their sliders are huge, and their pita chips w/ spinach dip are yummers!  4 stars = duh! for their wings.  Order them naked so you can try more than one type of dipping sauce; they have lots.  Garlic Parmesan is one of my favorites.  5 stars = for having games to play at your table.  They have trivia to play against other people at the bar as well.  Thumbs up if you want to watch a game and eat good food!",

I tell her can we sit at a different booth where it doesn't feel as crowded? She rolled her eyes again and said sure.  Then our waiter Rocky comes up and sounds miserable. He asked us what we wanted to drink with an attitude. After taking our drink order he takes about 10 minutes to come back with them....alll while I can see him just standing and talking to the other waitresses. He comes back with our drinks drops a straw and comes back 5 minutes later with my straw. He goes back to talking with tbe waitresses goes checks on a table walks around the seating area and then comes and asks my son if he ordered a snacksize of wings or the small. At this point he finally goes and puts our order. The service was awful!! My boyfriend, who was also with us was afraid to eat because he thought the water would do something to the order since he seemed not happy to be there.

She was on top of our waters and drink orders and was just overall great. Even brought out an extra honey sauce that my sister liked to take it to go for the food. Thank you Melissa!   We ordered Fried Pickles, Mini Corn Dogs, Fries, and Boneless Chicken. All were delicious BUT the fries. The first batch of fries tasted old and as if it was sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. I asked Melissa if we could get another batch of fries and she did quickly. She mentioned that another server must have not grabbed it for another order so she grabbed the wrong one, but I was thinking, after a few minutes, why weren't they tossed out so it wouldn't be brought out? But the situation was fixed so no harm no foul. The fries is the reason why I took off one star.   Overall our lunch date was great. All because of Melissa honestly. I would go back just to have her serve me again. She was on top of everything and one of the best servers ever.",

Well I tried a final call since I had my mind set on Wings and they picked up. I want to mention that when I ordered my boneless wings, the employee specifically asked me \"did you want 8 or 12..\" I went with 8. When we finally got our food.. I opened my boxes of wings which should contain 4 wings each.  There was only 3 in one of them.. and it looked like someone had eaten it (I wish I took a picture). immediately I called them and told them situation when the employee says \"Oh yea, they're doing a new thing where it's on 7 or 11 wings..\" I wasn't going to argue with that. However he asked me if I wanted 8 or 12 when I ordered. My wrap and my boyfriend's was trash. Barely any sauce, chicken was not fresh and crispy but rather rubbery. And I didn't even bother finishing the food. Only my wings which were actually good. I also want to mention that we ordered extra ranch which we didn't get either. Waste of money and time.. literally McDonalds would've given us better quality for that money.",

I am a frequent patron of BWWs all over the country, I simply love the wings so know have a pretty good idea of what normally to expect   This location however just fell flat, the service was horribly slow the staff apparently have never worked in a BWW before because they had no idea how to speak up and at their guest when it is the typical a roar of noise in these places  The waiter who brought us our food was rude reached across the table and people.    We had empty glasses waiting to order  The carrots and celery sticks were server with pools of water I. The bottom of the container   My wife's burger was cold   The list just goes on.    To top it all off we happen to flag the manager down and had to ask for our waitress and he could have taken that opportunity then to check In with us but didn't",

The manager even saw us and would just walk by without giving us the time of day. Our server was nice, invested but not doing/saying what he should have been. I asked for condiments and silverware and didn't get them till after we were halfway done with our food. It took 20 min to get the game on the tv (there's 72929292 TVs...) and I've literally NEVER witnessed someone look so miserable at their job like I did this MANAGER. You would have thought somebody keyed his car or stole his belongings. Typically managers engage with customers or help when their servers are lacking but he was pitiful. Worst BWW I've ever been to EVER.",

The drinks are good, but no refills on anything but soda, and the wilder flavors of lemonade aren't available to taste, and the waitress told me if I didn't like it I would have to purchase a new one! Whaaaa? Seriously?  The nachos would have been good, the meat was tasty, except they were covered in so much lettuce we literally didn't know there was cheese on them til the last two! My first bite had gristle in it, and the flavor was exactly like Middle School cafeteria tacos.  Service is speedy enough, if blase. I'm sure we'll be there again, because my dream of chicken fingers for lunch blinds me to the fact that I've never left here full.",

Almost 20 minutes for all of our drinks to arrive, we had to suggest she put our appetizer order in (cheese curds, they are bomb) then we waited so long for our main course (wings) we had to ask if we could just get them to go. The server mentioned that the food was in the window so she packaged it herself. Of course some of the food was cold and part of the order messed up which we did not notice until we were heading out the parking lot running late to get home. This was last Sunday, it was busy, but well staffed. We just had a lousy server. The two others I was with love the place, yet it was my first visit. 2 adults, 1 kid, plus 3 drinks was over $100 with the tip. I expected more.",

Everything was all well and good at home until... wtf is this, one of our wings still had feathers on it!!! This was the most absolutely disgusting thing I have ever seen. Nobody at the table could finish their food and my brother almost threw up. They probably checked to see if the order was to-go and said oh it's whatever they'll be gone anyways.

They said they had no idea what they could do about the situation so I just went back to the store trying to see if I could switch out for the correct order. When I got there they explained to me that they could not refund me  the $13  that I just spend on someone else's food and that I had to pay another $16 for the meal I ordered in the first place but they wouldnt let me pay $3 difference instead of another $16. So I was going to stay and get the correct order but another 10 minutes go by and at this point it's already 2:45am. So I decided to cancel my order and I was told By the employee only a manager would be able to refund my money and that wouldnt be until 7:00 a.m. when he came in for his shift.  So at 10:00 a.m. I went ahead and called  And when employee that answered and I told him what I was  calling about his response just was if I was coming back in for the wings I ordered at 2:00 a.m. and I told him no and at this point he hung up on me after he said have a great day. So I never received any food still waiting to get a refund. This company has horrible customer service. I even email the corporate office they said they would handle it but im still waiting on my refund.

Super frustrating when ordering for multiple people, with multiple flavors chosen to fit their palates.

She stayed that you have to play $20 to get a comp, I said I did play $20.  She said that you have to lose the whole $20 to get a comp.  I told her that have never heard that from a Buffalo Wild Wings in Las Vegas before. She said that since the restaurant went corporate 10 years ago it's always been that way.   So Why don't they state on the machine: play & lose $20 to get a comp drink??   The bartender did take the beer off the receipt and I paid for my food.  Just wondering has anyone else been told this at BWW?",

(Free small dessert) Really?? It's Vegas  I used to love coming here but the drinks tasted like juice and we were given an attitude by the bartenders who were serving us. We gambled over 20 bucks and because of that we should have been comped a free drink. Instead they gave an attitude and refused to comp us. Won't be back.",

    "text": "If this bdubs wasn't so close to my house, I wouldn't have gone a second time.   We moved to the area a few months ago, before that, we frequented the Hualapai location. This is the second time I've ordered pickup here and the last.  The first time I ordered a large pack of wings, various sides, and of course a chicken tenders and buffalo chips meal for the kiddo. They forgot the kiddos food, but of course I was charged for it. After setting everyone's plates up and sitting down for the movie, my son opens up his box and all there is is some French fries. I went back to pick it up and caught some attitude from the young lady at the front desk. Not only did she not offer some ranch, chicken, or an apology, they couldn't even offer up a side of manners.  The second time (today) the same thing happened. I figured I'd give them another chance, especially because my family loves the food. Guess what, the tenders and buffalo chips are missing again. I don't know what it is, but maybe that combination is just bad luck. The wife is heading back now to pick up the missing items, since she doesn't want me causing a scene. So I figured I can vent on Yelp instead.  Next time we decide to get bdubs, we'll be driving a little farther.  If it makes a difference, the first time I ordered via phone, second time was via the app. Both times I was charged for the missing items, and they were listed on the receipts.  Now to wait for the rest of the food while the wings get cold. Thanks for nothing!",

If tips went directly to chefs, I would've stiffed him. It was slow, no rush, only about 4-5 parties there and one to-go order. I only tipped because the bartender was cool and it wasn't his fault the chef was being slow to the point of taking an hour to make a snack-sized.",

But today I go to the to front desk to order my food from the hostess, and as I'm asking about a few items that I've never had and she starts rolling her eyes responding very rudely. She seem to be upset so i tried to make her laugh and she again \"ROLLED HER EYES\" (She did it several times). We finally order our food, she then tells us the price on the food and it was extremely high, so I asked why was it so high. She had put the meal in twice on the order and I told her I'm sorry I only wanted one 6 piece tender and she responded \"NO YOU TOLD ME TWO\" I then told her no I only wanted one. Again she \" ROLLS HER EYES\" and with an attitude says \"NO YOU ASKED FOR TWO\". I then repeat to her I only wanted one. I then asked her to please make sure they put ranch in the bag because the night before the bartender forgot to put the ranch in the bag and i had to eat the chicken naked. She then responds with we charge for every ranch, i said ok well can you replace the ranch that we payed for yesterday and did not receive. She again \"ROLLED HER EYES\" and said i have to charge you for that, very rudely. The manager David who was on duty, was unhelpful and did not care about how she treated us, and had no care to fix the situation.   P.s. we are also servers at very busy restaurant and we understand that restaurants can become very hectic and overwhelming but we never speak or treat any customers like that. Also it was 10:30pm and no one was in the restaurant for the hostess to be overwhelmed for any sort of moment.   Sucks when your favorite local bar treats you like crap. Thanks B-Dubs two thumbs down",

But this last time we visited was kind of unacceptable. My boyfriend ate absolute raw chicken (boneless wings), the manager and waiter apologized, which was nice, but they only took off my boyfriend's meal and a $5 coupon we had. They didn't take off my chicken wings from the bill. As a manager, I would've absolutely AT LEAST comped (taken off) any and all chicken involved with the bill. They only took off the boneless wings he was eating because he mentioned it. And on top of that, they gave us two $5 coupons off for our next visit. It's like they gave us two extra times we could potentially get salmonella, haha. Even though the situation in itself is not that big of a deal, and even though they comped us a little and apologized, I, personally, would have comped the entirety of the bill. Since they didn't acknowledge this as big of a deal as it is (I'm in the medical field and my boyfriend is trained in food safety so it's a big deal to us, as it should be), we will not be returning. They have lost our business (which we have given a couple times a week for the past year and the upcoming 5+ years), and it's so sad because we truly like coming here. It's just that they handled this so poorly. I'm writing a review so that they know to please comp the next bill they give out to someone in case it's identified as raw chicken for someone else. Thanks for reading!",

They have added additional flavors and styles (such as the dry rub) but I always go with either traditional or boneless mild/BBQ.  The main thing I notice isn't as good is how the wings are sauced.  Sometimes all in the same order one wing will be loaded and another one almost dry.  Service is always really good here though, servers refill drinks quickly and there are TV's everywhere you go to watch the game.  Lunch specials are available and they even have a frequent lunch card.  i might try other wing places, but I'll seldom turn-down an invite to \"B-Dubs\"",

Then they forgot the celery and carrots. I will never eat at this Buffalo Wild Wings again! And neither should you!",

    "text": "Came here tonight around 10:35 PM, there were 5 other tables (booths) filled in the dining area and a few people at the bar. There what looked like 5-6 servers plus the bartender so there was adequate coverage for the few people that were there at this hour. The manager took our drink order, he brought it to the table quickly once we placed the order. He notified us that the server was busy and would be with us shortly ... time passes ... still not server after 10 mins ... more time passes ... still no server (25 mins had passed) by this time we sat there till 11:00 PM and didn't see our server once, mind you 3 other servers passed us and were tending to there tables with drinks and food so apparently our server got lost. Either way tonight was the last time we will be at this buffalo wild wings because their service is horrible. You don't need a diploma or even a GED to be a server to know 25 mins to greet your customer is to long, so either the server was busy participating in the circle jerk that was taking place in the back or they got lost finding their way to our table to take our order. Either way there are some ignorant lazy ass people that work here. Never had wing stop but that will be the next place we try to get wings from - I'm sure they'll have better service than this place because you can not get any worse than the service at this buffalo wild wings location.   And if a manager or any person from Buffalo wild wings wants to contact me about this experience, I would be more than happy to talk to you - because your employees are poorly trained and your service SUCKS!",

    "text": "I love that B Dubs is such a relaxed, chill place AND is open 24 hours, although I have yet to even be at one past 10pm. Whether it's to go or dine in I've never had a big problem here (if there's a mistake it's very small and corrected very quickly), always get great service, good prices, great selection of drinks (although the mixed drinks are always super weak, so do yourself a favor and get beer or something nonalcoholic), and now that it's baseball season I love watching games while I'm eating. Food always comes pretty fast even when it's busy, and the food is always ready when they say it will be when I get it to go. I've always been curious to try the trivia they offer but am kind of busy stuffing my face and have messy hands, so it's still entertaining enough to watch it on the tv whilst waiting for food.  We go to B Dubs almost every week (mostly at this location too) and I can't imagine getting sick of it. I try to avoid busy restaurants on the weekend nights but this is always a good default when you don't want to be waiting for a table for 30 minutes to an hour somewhere else. This is a somewhat small location though and on nights with big fights or big games it is pretty crowded, so then I just go to the location on  Hualapai and Flamingo :) the parking lot is shared with a lot of other businesses so the few spots right in front of B Dubs can fill up quickly and you'll have to park off to the side. Almost nothing better than wings and beer, and I tend to order only medium, maybe some honey bbq or mild once in a great while! Garlic parmesan is alright and I'm not a big fan of the teriyaki. My only beef with B Dubs is that the mixed drinks are really lame, they're just so weak that you shouldn't bother ordering one and being pissed about the missing alcohol. Oh well!",

So I show up with a party of 5, order 3 beers and 2 sodas and ask for my game on a tv close to us. After 20 minutes of no drinks and no game I finally get the waitresses attention. She said she was sorry with the bad service and went to get the manager about the game while she gets the drinks. The manager was extremely non helpful and said \"well it looks like we don't get that game\" and walks away, even with me telling him that I called ahead twice. We all ended up just walking out disgusted with the terrible service. AVOID THIS BWW LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!!!",

To top it all off... I accidentally left my cell phone on the table when we left the resturant. He ran... not jogged a bit hoping to catch us but, if not, big deal... no... he, outta breath when he caught us, hollering to get us to stop, SPRINTED, across two parking lots, to catch us before we pulled out into the street, to bring me my phone. Freak'n awesome!!! Great wings! Big and meaty and cooked just right. Lots of sauce choices. Great appetizers. Good iced tea. Tons of TV's. They were even very friendly and accommodating whe we asked if they could try to find us a hockey game. What a great experience!",

Buffalo Wild Wings can definitely fill those shoes.  There were a couple of BWW in the Valley in CA that I knew about, but I never gave them a try simply because I was already happy with the food and service at that other place.  I tend to be very loyal to a restaurant once I find one I like.    This BWW is, literally, less than a mile from our house, so we gave it a shot.  The wings were meaty, the chicken club sandwich was juicy, and the Southwestern Chicken flip that my girlfriend got was delicious.  The service was also very good, albeit a little TOO friendly at times - made it seem as if we were being served by some wings cultists looking for recruits or something.  That's not a complaint (as overly good service is always preferred over the alternative) - it's just that they didn't need to try so hard.  We've definitely found our local wings restaurant.",

FOOD WAS SUPER GREAT, like always (: but then the girl only checked on us once, and she was really late with giving us refills with the drinks. After we ate our meal, we tried getting the check, and it took us 4 times to call her and get it for us !! she passed by us like 3 times and i saw her look at us and YET she still didnt come up to the table. until i finally yelled out EXCUSE ME then she turned around and came up to the table. tsk tsk.

The food is good, the servers are usually pretty friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the prices aren't too bad.   First off, the most important thing here, to me, are the wings. I love the traditional wings, but I've been enjoying the boneless lately because sometimes you'll get a gross chicken wing that came from a chicken on 'roids. You know, that super buff chicken that was always a jerk to all the other chickens for not being as muscular as he was... Anyways, those always taste like crap. So I've been sticking to the boneless; they're also more filling. Now the main thing at BWW's are the sauces. They have 14 sauces, 4 dry seasonings, and from time to time they will introduce a new sauce or seasoning, such as Captain Morgan sauce or Thai Curry seasoning. My all time favorite remains the Mango Habanero sauce. As far as the other food, it's really nothing special, some burgers, salads, wraps, and other basic menu items that most American casual dining restaurants will offer. Of course, you can add your favorite sauce to most of the menu items. They also offer a kid's menu and desserts.   Next are the servers and atmosphere. Most of the times that I have been to BWW's, I have had a pretty friendly server, but there have been times when my server just really sucked. But I guess you will find that with a lot of places and you shouldn't be too concerned about that aspect because it will change by location, time of day, etc....  The atmosphere is fun! A bunch of flat screens all over the walls, some projectors, there's music, (which you can pay to pick, jukebox style), playing in the background, trivia games going on, and even games that you can bring to your table and pay to play. They are always showing basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and softball games as well as Nascar races, UFC fights, and other sports events. It's really a family friendly sports bar with good food.   The prices aren't bad. A plate of wings will cost you from 6-12 dollars, depending on how many you get and if you choose bone in or boneless, which are slightly more expensive. They do have some cool deals though, like traditional Tuesdays when traditional wings are offered at 45 cents each and boneless Thursdays when boneless wings are offered at 60 cents each. Typically, ranch and celery/carrots come on the side at no additional cost, however on these days it costs 60 cents extra for each cup of ranch.   Buffalo Wild Wings is a good place to grab a quick lunch or to watch the game with the guys and enjoy some good wings and a couple beers. If you haven't been, I would recommend it!",

I had the bbq wrap, which was made perfectly to balance with the meat and the lettuce. Mmm. The sauce in it was yummy.   This is would be a great place to just hang out with friends and eat great wings. Must visit again when I'm there.",
