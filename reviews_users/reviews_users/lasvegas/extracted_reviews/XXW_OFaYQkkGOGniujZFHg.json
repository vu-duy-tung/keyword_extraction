    "text": "Unfortunately, I haven't sat inside the restaurant yet, but I thought the Fireside Lounge was worth checking out. (Rolling in at 10 in the morning, no one's there anyway, so I had the place all to myself pretty much my entire visit.)  I absolutely LOVED the ambiance of the lounge. Comfortable couches surrounded by fire atop a small pool of water. But after the first few minutes, it's nothing to get that hyped up over -- but it is quite calm and relaxing.  My server was incredibly sweet and helped me figure out a drink. I ordered a mild Bloody Mary, and for the first time EVER, it was made just right for me.   My only gripe, unfortunately, was the mozzarella sticks. They were COLD. In one of them, the cheese came out in one lump. It was like they had been sitting there for a long time, and seeing as how I was the only one in there, it didn't make a whole lot of sense as to why they weren't piping hot. Something you'd expect from a Denny's, honestly. But in the long run, WHATEVER -- you don't come all the way out to Vegas to gorge on mozzarella sticks, do you? No.",

Food: I got the alfredo fettuchine with shrimps and garlic bread. It was expensive, but delicious and big portion! It even comes with a side salad that was loaded with toppings like eggs and bacon.   Drinks: I got a drink with sparkling wine in it with cinnamon and bitters. It was quite tasty! I also tried the mai tai, which was normal.  Someone goes around asking to take your picture and then asks if you want to buy it. But you do get a free picture preview.  Service is quick and friendly.  I want to try the breakfast food next time I come back to vegas.",

Total throwback to the 70s. In fact, the Fireside lounge was featured in a scene from the movie Casino. Our waitress was friendly and gave us some good drink recommendations. It's a great place for an after dinner drink and intimate conversation. They give you complimentary honey roasted nuts and aren't quick to rush you out or bother you too much.",

Careful, when we went at around noon on the Monday before New Years, and it was absolutely packed. Thankfully the booths are first come, first serve. So if you're only a couple, you will not have to wait over 1 hour to get seated into the booths.  Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!",

As others have said, the food is good, no matter what you order, and the portions are huge! The fruit plate, for instance, is large enough for 2 or more people. I love the ambiance of the neon lighting, the fake cherry trees, and the friendly staff. It's just so Vegas!  The cocktail waitresses wear these long, flowing black dresses and come into the restaurant from the lounge to take your drink orders. If you want to really get crazy with the drinks, order a Scorpion...it comes in a huge bowl with straws and is meant to be shared! You gotta see it to believe it! I shared one with my nephew and his wife and it was amazing.   The Fireside Lounge is a trip all by itself. It looks to me like something out of the 1970's: shag carpeting, and a main sunken seating area around a flaming fountain. There are video screens everywhere showing music videos.  I have come here numerous times on dates, with friends, after photo shoots, etc. Just kicked back and had a drink (or two or three) and ordered appetizers. Again, love those friendly, attentive cocktail waitresses dressed in classy black!   So if you want to have a good meal, or just a drink, stop by one of the best-kept local secrets in town...The Peppermill!",

Every time I've gone there I've had the pleasure of enjoying the ambience and the servers though busy still very attentive..  this last time would be the exception. Ms. Elisha was my bone of contention even prior to seating. Her initial look made it seem as if we knew each other and not in a good way.. so the idea that we were seated her area for service seem unreal.. she made us wait without acknowledging our presence at all.. then when she came to take our order she looked over and around us out the window.. still I smile.. when she was done my husband asked me if there was something interesting out the window..  when the food was ready it was damn near tossed in the table.. we did not see her again until the receipt was ready.. she literally in passing tossed the receipt on the table almost in my husbands plate.. I stopped smiling at that point.. she saw the expression on my face change.. because I was fed up.. so she did decided to turn around and come back to the table and give some    Insincere ass attempt at service recovery.. but it was too late.. you don't throw things.. and you don't behave as if someone is bothering your ass while you're at work.. I'm only hoping that I'm not subjected to this missy on my next visit.. but they can keep serving bomb food..",

However I ordered what was the best Ruben sandwich I have ever had in my life.  Was full of flavour and so big I could barely  eat half of it. My boyfriend and his friend both got the pastrami sandwich which were both as big and my girlfriend had a burger. The margarita  bomb we had to wash it down was super good and super strong... No complaints there! Waitresses were very friendly and happy to assist. Will be back for more next time I'm in Vegas!",

You might think that's a good thing since, like any normal person, nothing gets you more hot and bothered than simultaneously thinking about skanks and Moons Over My Hammy. In reality, it's not so much a good thing (I know, hard to imagine how a slutty Denny's wouldn't be amazing). Unfortunately, the food is pretty terrible, and the service is about on-par with any other diner. If there is one saving grace, it's the nachos. And not because they're particularly delicious, but because of the sheer excess with which they're slammed onto your table.   Atmosphere is about what you'd expect: lots of drunk people eating nachos. And lots of riff-raff treating it like an actual restaurant. It's not a restaurant, it's a hardcore nacho stop before you go throw up and go to sleep.",

My husband had chicken fried steak. No bread was served with it and for a southerner that is a problem. The food was overpriced and not very good. We won't be back.",

I feel like some items are about $5 too much, but that's Vegas for you. so considering your other options here, it's a good value. heads up that the chicken parm can actually feed 2 people! with all the options in Vegas I've yet to try, I can't say I'll be back, but I'm definitely glad I stopped in. it has a fun old-school kinda vibe w neon lights and old jams playing. so it's a fun atmosphere. one thing I thought was a little weird was someone was going around to tables asking if people wanted their pictures taken. again, Vegas, but still. a bit odd. they also don't split checks, so if you haven't figured out Venmo by now, get on that",

The service here was good, and the drinks were strong. 14 dollars for a double jack & coke.  The food was pretty good as well. The portions were more than enough, even for those in our group who really like to eat. The food quality was not bad food for the price. I wanted to try a gyro and was satisfied but not impressed. They gyro consisted of meat (pretty sure it was not lamb), cucumber sauce, chopped tomatoes and that was it. The side of fruit was very generous though so points for that. Overall I would try again if someone else wanted to but would not go out of my way to get there, or make this the main meal of the trip. I'd recommend going and getting things other than the gyro.",

Neon, flames, mirrors, trees w lights, great drinks, friendly( hardworking)staff and huge yummy portions. Did I mention this was all for breakfast?. You can thank me later.  The menu is varied and you can come any time of day and get something good.  It's old Vegas baby. Soak it up.  I've been coming here for 30 years.  Good when I was 21 w my drunk friends and good w my teen girls now.  You can't get this anywhere else.  While you wait for a table have a drink in the bar Who cares what time of day it is. Who even asks what time it is in Vegas? Enjoy the unapologetic vibe and your togo box later",

    "text": "24Hr diner with decor of a strip club. It is however, a good place to stop if you're looking for a decent meal at late hours.   The service is quite fast and there is quite a few options to choose from. At 3AM I opted for a cup of coffee and \"Joe's San Francisco Special.\" Basically, thats a few eggs, spinach, onions, ground beef & sausage, and topped with cheese sauce. Originally it includes hash browns mixed in there but I asked for them to set that aside since I wasn't so sure I wanted to eat them. You do get an option of toast but I chose to try their warm blueberry muffin! I'm so glad I went with that because it was the best part of the entire meal.    The prices for breakfast are along the lines as a typical diner such as Norms or Denny's but their plates are much much larger here. Honestly, if you were to split a plate with someone, I think you would be better off.   The coffee was watered down but then again if they're making so much of it, I can imagine this is not their main concern.  Good place to get a bite to eat if you're not in the mood to be picky. I can see how this place gets crowded after-hours as the \"meet up spot.\"",

The theme here is very retro and bright. I enjoy it!   The portions are huge (omelettes have 10 eggs, why not just make it a dozen lol)   The 2nd time I went to the fire lounge had a bloody mary, and was seated with the same server again who was just as amazing as the 1st time. However the food was not as good. We ordered cheese sticks which were good and the nachos. I have heard the legend of these nachos and I will NEVER order them again. I got them and the beans that came on the side tasted and smelled rotten. I almost threw up! It took me 25 minutes to waive down the server when she finally came and we told her the beans were bad she took it to the kitchen, came back and said there was a problem with the beans. WELL maybe she should have checked on other tables to make sure they dont eat rotten beans.   I am nervous to go back because I dont know if it is going to be good or bad the 3rd time I go.",

Done just about everything the city can offer, but two things are a must every time I'm in town - Frankie's Tiki Room and the Peppermill.  Whether its greyhounds and NFL on sunday morning or 4AM bacon and eggs after a night out, the Peppermill just wins.  People complain about the prices?  it's not Denny's.  It's about $15 a plate for breakfast and worth every penny.  Almost always a wait.  The bloody marys are $11 or $13 for a double, so...yes, of course.  They have their own parking lot, but really; I have never been in condition to drive either before or after a visit.  The service is excellent, considering the sheer volume of bro's and out of town knuckleheads they have to deal with 24 hours per day.  The cocktail waitresses are all 8's or better and they doll them up in full length cocktail dresses that make them look like angels from above.  If you are in town, on Yelp right now looking for a place to eat, put the phone in your pocket, grab a cab and head to the Peppermill RIGHT NOW. PS - Avoid the Eastern European girl who circles offering to take a pic - she's a shitty photographer and she charges $25",

The service is stellar - every single time I've gone I've received excellent service.   It can get packed on the weekends, especially if you arrive after 10am.

This Place was Great! From the minute you walk in you can feel the Vibe, and that is a rare thing. The service was Great but the food was even better, i had the French Dip with aiju gravy on French bread. Top of the line. The roast beef was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just the right taste to complement the sandwich not over power it. The fries were shoe string and freshly cut. The one thing that stood out and it was part of the Vibe, was the diversity of the staff, all had their part to do, no negative energy between any. I sat there and watched this place run like a well oiled machine. And the Price was great for the amount of food we got. I will be back again",

I loved the decor  it was clean we had one issue with a very confused server and the waitress went above and beyond to resolve it.   The food was good and cooked as ordered and there was plenty of it, good service which is to be expected everywhere else, but this is Vegas where people go to dieThe Peppermill however is staffed by vibrant attentive staff.   If you go spend some time in the lounge if you're too young see why the 70's were so strange if you're old enough you can revisit what you forgot in the booze coked filled era and relish that you made it out alive.",

It's diner style food, but I would say definitely better than Denny's. Extremely large portions, so if you'd like to share, it's plenty to go around.   BIG disappointment when after finishing my food and the last stop of my coffee, i found that the bottom of my coffee cup had a long piece of hair in it.   It was disgusting, considering i had already finished eating and had a refill of the coffee, but hadn't seen the hair when i drank the first round, since the refill came in before the cup was done. So the hair was sotting at the bottom the whole time.     I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the hair.",

I was recently in Vegas for a conference and my friend and I settled on a True local joint for dinner one night. The decor of the Peppermill reminds me of a 80s or early 90s night club with all kinds of shiny decor. I ordered a bloody mary with my dinner which I ended up settling on the Joe's San Francisco special which was essentially a heaping pile of hash browns, eggs, ground beef, and all kinds of other stuff. It was really tasty and I have zero complaints. It was definitely enough food for about three people so keep that in mind. The menu is vast and I have no doubt there is something for everyone on the menu. If you're looking for a local establishment that is not on the heart of the Vegas strip, go north a few miles and check out the Peppermill.",

Quick service at first, but that is where that stopped. Once our food came,it was hard to find our waitress. We saw more of the photographer hacking snapshots on cheap postcards. (If I wanted a photo of myself here, I would take a selfie). What bothered me most is the pricing. Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving. And once again no response, not even a \"I'm sorry to hear that\". She just rolled her eyes.  My vote next time. Save a couple of bucks and eat next door at Denny's.",

Showed up at around 5 am and a friend and I split some kind of nachos that were pretty good. Of course we weren't expecting mexican food and what we got was not very mexican, but at least it was what we expected. Another friend got a denver omelette and said it was the bomb. The waitress was very nice (read she didn't press sexual harassment charges against any of my friends) and had a good sense of humor. It's nice that they're open when you need them. Other than that, I really can't comment on the price or even the ambiance.",

Then after reading the reviews on here I knew I absolutely had to go since I prefer places with..hmm..lets call it  \"character\".  Cheesy. Check. A little tacky. Check. Absolutely wonderful. I think so.  I made the lounge my first stop after arriving in Vegas at 2am. I was surrounded by fake plastic trees and hot pink rope lights. I sat where I could overlook the fire pit and was served by a waitress in an evening gown. She and I bonded over making fun of the guy I was with as he asked a billion questions about martinis and I, the chick, just ordered a beer. The alcohol prices, I would soon learn, are pretty much on par with most places in Vegas. They did however have pretty good booze specials that started at either 3 or 4 am ( I cant remember exactly) and ran for a couple hours. I also opted to feast on some nachos.  One order was more than enough for 2 people. Oh, and I know this may not be important to all but I was very impressed that the nachos were clearly layered. By this I mean Chips then cheese then chips then cheese etc.  Not just cheese on the very top of the chips. What can I say? Little things impress the hell out of me. In conclusion, it was a great start to my first trip to Vegas. Oh, Peppermill I will be seeing you again soon.",

What do I have to do to get a plain bun around here? Unfortunately I was too sleep deprived and too cranky to enjoy the food by then. It didn't help that my bf and I started arguing. And the table across from us offered unsolicited advice on how to get ketchup out of the bottle. I wish I was in a better mood, I don't think I gave this place a fair shot.",

He loves this restaurant and it is a real treat since it really is one of a kind.  This restaurant has a fun atmosphere, great service, great food and always leaves you full and happy every time!  We ordered fish and chips and southern fried steak which came with choice of bread and salad or soup. The both of these dishes were fantastic and he had to take half of his meal home as there must have been 2 pounds of curly fries with his fish and chips lol.  I snuck away and informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday so I picked out a dessert to present him with!  I chose the THE ELEGANT BROWNIE, a yummy chocolate fudge brownie served steaming hot with a mound of creamy French vanilla ice cream, smothered in warm chocolate fudge sauce and layered with whipped cream and sprinkles.  This dessert was ridiculous good, that homemade brownie and combination of fudge and ice cream was insane orgasmic good!   They came to the table with his dessert lit up with a candle and sang happy birthday and it was so much fun!  Our experience is always stellar here and every time they always manage to top the last visit.",

This time I thought about asking for watermelon only instead of honeydew and cantaloupe and they made it that way.  This time instead of a slice of banana bread I got a whole mini loaf.  The fruit platter has a nice assortment with strawberries, grapes, pears, pineapple, kiwi and the melon.  The disappointing thing and reason for low stars was had leftovers that I took back and next morning strawberries were moldy already.",

It has everything under the sun with a pretty extensive menu that almost reads like a book. It's a little on the expensive side but the portions of food are amazing.

( Take on the 64oz Scorpion, if you dare) This place not only has history here and has been around but it was actually used in the filming of the movie \"Casino\" which is a favorite film of mine, I'd say it's a must go for any Vegas/Movie fan.",

    "text": "Before I launch into this review, I should probably offer the following frame of reference: I have a fierce, crushing obsession with breakfast/brunch at traditional American diner-type places, and The Peppermill met or exceeded pretty much every expectation that I have of this type of restaurant.  I will definitely be honest with my review, but if I ever come across as overly enthusiastic with the heart-eyes, that's why. First things first: If you go during high-time, expect a fairly substantial wait. We got there around 7:30am and were promptly seated, but when we left at 9:00am, there were people being told it would be an hour wait, so be prepared.  Probably the first thing you will notice when you walk in is the decor, and honestly, the ambiance was my absolute favorite part about this place! Trees all over the place, disco-ball pattern ceiling, stained glass, neon lights, fire pits in the lounge area, rainbow sugar in the sugar shakers (a favorite of mine), etc. This place is just plain groovy, like the True 70's definition of groovy. The attention to detail and dedication to the diner vibe is unmatched. For breakfast, I ordered a decaf coffee (which I filled with rainbow sugar) and then pancakes with scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage and my sister got caprese salad (this place has a lot of options). I thought the food was wonderful. 4 Stars. Not over-the-top incredible, but great and very diner-esque. Fluffy pancakes, whipped butter, and thick, crispy bacon. As I sat in our 50's-style booth gazing around the restaurant with a tummy full of delicious breakfast, I vowed to come here for a meal every time I visit Vegas. And I recommend you do the same! Or, ya know, at least give it a try :) This place is special - it has all the glitz and glam and showmanship of Vegas, but with a vintage feel. One of a kind and just plain fun!",

We were also helped immediately by our waiter, also - a pretty bar girl taking alcoholic requests and got approached by the Staff photographer who insisted the photo is free. This was the hugest problem we had with Peppermill since she INSISTED the photo is free - to take! To have is $20 for one copy, $25 for a second. Um, sorry, that's not a deal when the first is overpriced at $20!   We wanted some light bites and got the appetizer platter (substituted the Shrimp for more cheese sticks), and got the Fruit Boat for $18.99 with a side of cottage cheese. It was all fine with a cool presentation with a great waiter.   On a side note, the bathrooms are very clean which is appreciated considering it was a Friday of a holiday weekend with lots of tourists! And a wedding party to boot!",

The Gym is beautiful as well and the buffet inside is the best one I ever encountered. They have deals that I have seen multiple times. Specials if you will.. Groupon a good source that I can testify to using and smooth transactions had taken place because of there dependability. Good stuff. I still am going to go try other places though so I wont prolly be going here next time just so I can get a new experience. So much to experience in Reno.

The eggs we're perfectly and eerily circular - not only the yolks, but all three eggs shared a single plate-sized egg white bed that was was also a perfect circle.  The whole plate felt like it was produced in a vending machine.    The meal lacked of flavor, color, character, and any sense of appeal.  Even the English muffin was bad!  How do you mess up an English muffin for God-sake?!  It was puffy and soft and had no chew or texture.  It was terrible.

I have never eaten at the diner, only ever been to the lounge.  The lounge is really fun.  There's a fire pit.  There's super comfy round banquette seating.  There's an abundance of fake flowers and tv screens playing music from literally every era.  When are you gonna hear Dean Martin and No Doubt back to back?  The servers are dressed in long black gowns and some of them even wear sateen gloves.  They have to squat down when taking your order.  The drinks are good.  You can feel comfortable coming here whether your in a group, a couple or solo.",

(Hot chocolate taste like water)Then we waited another 20mins for our order to be taken, to which I had to go speak with the manger for that to be done. No one even acknowledge our party. While waiting for out food, I noticed food just seating at the kitchen and low and behold it was ours. The food had been seating there over 10minutes. When I brought it to the waitress attention, she snapped at me with an attitude. Our food came out wrong to the point where I asked host for the head manager and she never told her she walk right passed her and didn't say anything. We basically paid for food not worth it. $120 wasted!!!! Will not be returning!!!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I flew to Vegas for the weekend to meet a couple of our friends. Our stay was very short, so our schedule was strict. We wanted something quick for breakfast so we could get moving. My friend and I chose this place because it was .2 miles away from our hotel, so we could walk over and grab food.  When we arrived the line / waiting area was far out the door! Walking inside made me feel like I was in a mix of an old diner and a strip club. The lighting was low and there were red florescent bars around the booths. The cocktail waitresses were wearing prom dresses / evening gowns and the waitresses were wearing skirted overalls. Very interesting place.  While we waited for our food we sat in a booth around the fire place. My friend and I ordered Bloody Mary's at the bar. The bartender took a while to check our ID's (under the light, put her glasses on, the whole 9 yards) and then said she didn't like mine much? I'm assuming because the print is small but, who knows. We watched her make the drinks - poured a brown liquid on the bottom (we assumed was Worcestershire sauce) and then filled the rest of the glass with red liquid from a box (the tomato base). We never saw her pick up a vodka bottle or add anything else to the glass, so we gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe the vodka was premixed with the tomato base. Once we got to our seat near the fire we quickly realized we paid 11$ for a cup of tomato juice. I don't know if she thought we were underage and tried to pull one on us that we wouldn't notice? Either way we were not amused but didn't want to cause a scene, as they were VERY busy and we wanted to get out of there once our food was ready. Plus we had vodka back at the room, so we took our \"Bloody Mary's\" to go and fixed them up ourselves.  The food did come out fast which was nice! The server who brought us our food opened each container to show us what was inside - we had 4 breakfast orders so it was helpful to make sure everyone's order was complete! We appreciated that.   My boyfriend ordered an omelette and it was HUGE! They must have used a ton of eggs. He had enough left over to have a small bite to eat the next morning before we left. I ordered the Munch's Breakfast that had sausage, peppers, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms stirred into hash browns topped with eggs. It sounded similar to one of my favorite dishes back home, and I learned my lesson to never order a dish expecting it to taste the same somewhere else! I saw a few strings of hash browns, maybe. The rest of the ingredients were cut and cooked in a mess of grease. I did not like the food at all. I stole some of my boyfriend's hash browns and ate my toast before we went out for the day.  I saw a couple reviews of customers stating they've never had a sober meal here and I kind of see why.",

Everything you could want or need on the menu, fancy cocktail waitresses in long gowns delivering crazy drinks,  and the adjacent fireside lounge where old people go to make out. Who wouldn't give 5 stars?  I come here often,  as it's in between my work,  my gym,  my drinking spots,  and my house lol. I've been disappointed a few times by eggs not done right,  but hey,  they put up with a TON of drunk and disorderly tourists on a nightly basis.     My recommendations on the menu include almost anything breakfast,  the chicken wings,  the French dressing that you can get in the side salad, the cottage cheese and...omg... the Sin City BLT. Dude,  this thingis so delish.  It's a BLT made on extra yummy Texas toast,  with thick cut bacon,  lettuce,  tomato,  and...a fried egg with pesto aoli....damn! That sandwich is so good! Hits all the spots.  Breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner cravings all in one meal.",

The art deco flamingo lampshades gaudily clash with the mirror mosaic ceiling tiles, pink and purple neon lights and purple and turquoise seats (are they made of velour?!). There are fake trees and plants. The waitresses are dressed in brightly colored short dresses. What is not to love? The menu is varied with many breakfast or dinner choices. My southern fried steak was the best I can remember having. Ever. And I'm from TX.   We went with friends for brunch on a Sunday. Call ahead for a table if you don't want to wait. I'm glad I did so. I would love to go there as a last call stop after a night out on the Strip...it's gotta be an interesting place in the wee small hours if it was interesting on a late Sunday morning.   This is now going to be one of our this-is-Vegas spots for when people come to visit.   Love it! :)",

Everything looked OK, quick service, huge portions THEN A GIANT ROACH heading for our feet underneath the table.  Thank God my husband saw its huge antenas and he stomped it out.  No joke, the busboy paused to watch him do it and just kept walking on.  I am terrified of bugs, but this roach was a healthy sci fi thriller type roach who ate a whole rib eye in the back before coming out to the main floor for seconds.

For some reason, even though I'm no one special, the shift supervisor waited on me personally and the service was excellent.   I got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries, and it was both large and tasty.   Love the ambiance and neon lighting. I'm Generation X-er, so anthing that reminds me of a Brat Pack movie is going to sit well with me.   Don't forget to check out the Firepit Lounge, located just to your left as you walk in. Totally different atmosphere but just as positive. Perhaps a somewhat slower, more laid back pace. Enjoyed this place and will definitely be back.",

So after a few days, when my body is pissed off and my liver is overworked and ready to pack up and call it quits, I know it's time for some serious foodage to restore my partying abilities.  Time to go to Peppermill!  Yeah, one plate of food here could probably feed an entire army of ravenous adolescent boys.  Still, I can never seem to agree on a dish to split with my friends, so I always end up ordering something for myself, only to eat and eat and eat for like 45 minutes to maybe get through 1/4 of the food before I wave my white flag of surrender and admit that I have once again been dominated by the Peppermill.  No joke, the omelets are bigger than my head, and they should probably give you a shovel to eat the side of hash browns with.  However, quality has not been sacrificed for quantity.  The food tastes amazing, no matter if you go for lunch at noon or for a drunken munchie run at 4 AM.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm taking off one because I don't particularly like the part of the strip that it's located in.  Sorry Peppermill, otherwise, you're perfecto!!!",

I was told it would be about a ten minute wait \"but probably shorter.\" After seeing many groups go ahead of us- including ones that arrived after us including a drunk loud mouth lady who said she had been waiting a while, cursed the host out, and got a table; I decided to find out what was going on. I looked at the list and saw my name up high with a bunch of crossed out names below mine. I was rudely told we had not been past over and would be next.  I kept thinking \"everyone raves about this place. The food better be damned good because their service surely sucked.\" Unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered buffalo wing appetizers and they looked like they came straight out of a Sysco bag and into the deep fryer. The taste reminded me of something they may have fed us in grade-school.  My entree was shrimp scampi; half a dozen or so over-cooked shrimp in some oily sauce. The saving grace was the rice pilaf. Yes, it also looked like it was boiled, or microwaved in a bag, but it was not bad.  The atmosphere - remember the drunk lady?  Well we were at the table right next to her and every sentence was \"f this and f that, this persons an a-hole, f, f,f.....\" I would have said something but she was in a group of people including a large man wearing a \"Tap Out\" shirt who would have likely tied me into a pretzel and made me tap-out.  To summarize: lousy service, pre-prepared food that you could make better yourself, and a loud terrible atmosphere. We will not be back and the people who raved about this place to me should have their head (and tastebuds) examined.",

This is about a 75 year old place but well maintained and managed.  Next door to the Riviera--but he Riviera is sold and will be imploded to make way for Convention Center-- that will happen on a couple months.  A great place to relax and oh yes the appetizers were great.  Go there!!",

As we got to her know her more, we found out that she was switched from graveyard tonight. Which meant it was busier than normal.   Overall our experience was great and will Definitely visit peppermill again next time in Vegas",

Open 24 hours a day like any cool Vegas landmark should, so you can stop by whenever you feel like eating traditional diner fare. I am a sucker for breakfast foods, so I always seem to go for the fruity french toast. However the last time I shared a philly cheesesteak (which was great by the way!) and the nachos. OMG those nachos are insane! They arrived at our table on huge plate, piled high! We ordered it with the ground beef. The cheese& bean dip, salsa, and sour cream arrive on the side. That thing you can share with 5+ people! Between the two of us, we didn't even make a dent. Our server boxed it all up for us and it still took two to-go containers! There is also a photographer that comes by to all the tables and offers you a complimentary picture. We passed on the picture, but next time I might have to prom pose with my gigantic stack of pancakes! *swoon*   Even as a local, I enjoy the crazy decor and the food. I've been to the Peppermill twice now and both visits were consistently awesome! I look forward to my next meal dining under those fake trees.",

Super funky decor- weird indoor trees with fairy lights instead of leaves and cute 70's style diner booth seating. Staff are extremely friendly and more than happy to help you out with menu recommendations. Top of my list- the Nachos (be warned- they are HUGE) and the Corned Beef Hash Burger with Curly Fries. My God it is heaven! Food is fresh and comes out quickly. Be sure to bring an appetite!",

Before we were seated we went down into the lounge area to wait for our table and it was so cozy and picturesque! It felt as if it was 9 pm instead of 8 am because the first pit floating on top of the water on the lounge transported you well into the night! Once we were seated in the cherry blossom filled dining area I ordered a mimosa which was very well.koxed and also quite large in size. For food I ordered a breakfast special that had 3 pancakes, 4 sausage patties (turkey) and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese...I have no regrets! It was so delicious! My Wife ordered the steak and eggs which was cooked \"perfectly\" at medium temperature, it cut like butter! The service was split between 2-3 people, drink waitress, food waitress and what looked to be a bus boy who would grab any non alcoholic beverages before your food waitress arrived. There was also a young lady walking around taking pictures as a free souvenir which I thought was great! I'm sure we'll be eating here again before we head back to good ole Indiana!",

Throw in some delicious signiture drinks and you've got Peppermill.  Peppermill is a resteraunt on the right side of the enterance (boring) but walk thru the glass double doors on the left... and now you're talking!! Really chill vibe with red round couches, neon light rims, plastic plants around the room and a fire pit in the corner of the room.  Its low to normal noise level with music playing to videos on monitors thru the lounge. Smoke levels are very well maintained, but smoking and vapping are allowed.   Some basic bar food options are available along with a delicious array of signiture drinks. Pretty inexpensive prices for drinks considering it is located on the strip. I highly reccomend the Blue Hawaiian for a sweet strong drink. Check the pictures of what was on tonights order!",

I kept it simple by having ham and eggs. However this ham steak was a 16oz monster slab of meat bigger than my head. It was grilled and tasted great very salty with a touch of char from the grill. It came with 3 eggs and hash browns. Both were good and exactly what you would expect. Everyone else at our table enjoyed the food they got as well.",

    "text": "Koo Koo Kids And Their Koo Koo Lounge Set  Luckily I was able to come back to Peppy-mill. First rule of vacationing in Vegas or in general is to fully explore where you are so you don't have to go thru an epic battle to get back to it later. I had been here the week before to spend some quality time in the lounge. While you can order food in the lounge (not just the fruit salad in your drink), the restaurant is a whole different experience. I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.  I've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with.   The food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of \"mash up\" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants.   Something happened/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given.   So, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering.   One of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out \"as friends.\" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite?   So, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right?   There was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm.",

SO old Vegas, neon lights, cheescake, large. I loved it!   The food was decent for this type of place. I wasn't expecting Mastro's quality food. My mom and I got the Southwestern beef kabobs. They were ok. A bit overdone for my tastes. My husband got the swiss and mushroom burger, which I tried, and it was better than what I got. My dad liked his clam chowder.  Service was ok. Server messed up the order and had to be reminded to bring out a side dish. Maybe she was having an off day.  All in all, it was a fun experience. I'd probably go back to bring a friend who wanted to see old Vegas, and wasn't a food snob.",

    "text": "Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid-budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard-boiled eggs.  Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.    Upon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.  If you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.    The breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.    These are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.  I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day's events, whether sunburning by the pool, shopping in the outlets, hiding in a dark hotel room watching \"Ladyhawke,\" gambling away my retirement savings, or braving the gridlock on the 15.  Go disco breakfast!",

The blue carpet, oversized chairs, plush hot pink pillows by a firepit felt so 1970s. I almost felt like I should have had on bell bottoms and platform shoes. The waitresses were dressed in overall miniskirts with a mini hat and feathered hair. Classic!  My favorite spot in the whole restaurant was the lounge. The sunken fire pit with oversized couches was a great decor. The bad thing is if you drink too much and sit by the fireplace you will definitely pass out from the heat, it was unbearable. I ordered a mimosa and my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary. The drinks were large and filled with alcohol, well worth the money.   If you eat at this restaurant make sure you order light or plan on sharing. These meals are hearty. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day long.  If you're ever in town make sure you stop at the Peppermill you will feel like you just went back in time.",

Anyone who disparages the ambiance has got a screw loose, I tell them go back to the strip then where all they care about now is taking your money! The Peppermill was and is now a great place to go with friends, fill your stomach with great food and walk down \"Memory Lane\" !! I will always take my visitors there because it is an experience!",

I honestly don't know why the hype is about because the food was okay, nothing special. I would say it's a good place to eat after a night of drinking with your standard diner food. They have a person that comes around and takes a souvenir picture and cocktail waitress. I'm not one to send stuff back but I ordered a Mai Thai and had to send it back because it was not a Mai Thai. I had some of my friends try it and it just tasted like tap water. We also ordered a fudge brownie that was literally all chocolate syrup and one small piece of brownie. The ambiance is pretty cool, it's bright and has an old diner feel. I wouldn't come here again.",

If I was standing I would have fallen over seeing the size of the fruit-plate (more like platter) that our neighbors got. I think everything on the menu here is required to be larger than  your head.  Food is good diner fare, and for the ridiculous portion size the price is more than a killer deal.  Extra yays for free photo souvenirs and a giant jar of SPRINKLES on the table to add to whatever monstrous sized order of food you get.",

I got the 2 eggs and turkey sausage. Scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and it came with 4 Turkey Sausage patties. I also had them melt shredded cheddar cheese on top of the hash browns. As the side I got the blueberry muffin...it was the most amazing muffin I've ever had. They also have whipped butter, so it didn't tear the muffin or toast if you got that. My friend got the corn beef hash. She really liked it. It was a GIANT portion. It comes with basted eggs, which means sunny side up and then finished under the salamander. Its still runny though.  The cocktail girls now wear black satin dresses instead of the awesome velvet ones.",

I'm vegetarian, so I'm limited to begin with; and I'm kind of a health nut, so that limits me further.  If you're at all like me, avoid the egg dishes with the hash browns; in my opinion, there wasn't enough taste to compensate for how much oil/butter/fat was clearly used.  On the other hand, the waffles with fruit are SO GOOD.  I haven't tried the pancakes, but plan to next time I'm there.  I haven't tried any of the dinner options (not many options there for vegetarians), but if you like having breakfast anytime, this place is open 24/7 and serves breakfast items all day and all night.  It's a handy place to come if it's midnight and you're starving!  The cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.  The food by itself isn't mind-blowing, but it has a cool vibe - and conveniently is open 24/7, for your round-the-clock eating needs.

My favorite has to be their hot chocolate with whipped! I'm not sure why but something about their hot chocolate always warm up my night and wakes me up.   Their breakfast food is a must here!! Hash brown and omelet! Huge portion ,amazing price and yummy too! Burger is also decent! Meat is juicy and comes with many sides.   For those who are looking to grab some food after a night out or early morning brunch. This is def the place to go!  I'm hoping to try out more of their food when I go!! But will def come back!",

    "text": "Walking into The Peppermill is like walking into a lounge on a cruise ship. (Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.  When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.  Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.  That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.  After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both.   Do yourself a favor and take a step back in time next time you're on the Strip. The Peppermill is open 24 hours, so this hot tub time machine is always ready for a party.",

It took about a half hour for two of us to be seated. They recommended that we wait in the fireside room. We didn't take them up on that but it must be huge because people kept piling in there. You feel like you are in a bit of a time warp here. Waitresses in panty hose and plastic plants abound.   Once we were seated, the service was great. We decided to split the Lorraine omelette and a Belgian waffle. The omelette was light and fluffy. It featured the perfect amount of bacon. The waffle was solid. I ordered a mimosa for the Mr. It was quite large and carried the price tag to match its size.  My biggest complaint was trying to pay the bill to leave. They have one old fashioned register for the entire restaurant. I had to stand in a line, along the diner stool area and had to constantly move to get out of people's way. It took over 15 minutes to pay our bill.",

The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't.   Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick. And their BBQ sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup.   I'm not digging the hooker attire of the staff either. I will most definitely stick to the restaurants at the hotels.",

    "text": "Um, yuck. First, let me say that I don't like diner food, I detest \"breakfast\" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: OMG vom) and \"traditional\" \"American\" food barely qualifies as food IMO. (Pizza, burgers and chow mein: now THAT's American! Meatloaf and steak & eggs: ICK!) So to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. It IS, however, open 24/7 and near-ish my hotel.  First trip: I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's OK because it was gross. The sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. The garlic bread with \"cheese\" on it was revolting. My mum ordered the Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta. Hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. The sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, I swear, Mezetta brand right out of the jar (but I like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Cheese & Herb flavour. Second trip: I ordered New York steak and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. The shrimp were, too. My mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so I didn't taste them, but she said they were OK. I think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but I will avoid it. The waitresses were cute and helpful, though. And the decor is amusing.",

The drinks were good as well and, although the one I ordered had no price listed, I found it reasonable.  The atmosphere was fun - lots of bright lights and funky uniforms for the servers.  With everything stated above, I could give the Peppermill 4 stars, HOWEVER....  The server took FOREVER!!!  We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?  After that it took forever to flag her down... and even after she picked up the check it took her ages to swipe the credit card.  Although I enjoyed the food, the service absolutely killed it for me.  It was busy there, but by no means THAT busy.",

We tried to be forgiving and thought she must have had a lot on her plate *no pun intended* but anytime we did see her, she was just hanging outThis place could be a 5 Star but I would hope they'd work on employee attitudes, attentiveness, and productivity.",

I can't really put my finger on what it is but it's nice.   The ladies dress in cute dresses walking around in the bar/lounge area. And their most famous thing in the bar/lounge area is of course the fire pit. Oh, and I suggest everybody to try the Scorpion. It's good.  The restaurant serves huge portions of food. A group of 3 or 4 people could order just their nachos and share the whole thing. All of their food is good.   Oh and just so I don't forget they have a photographer walking around taking pictures at every table at the restaurant and the bar/lounge area.",

Having said that, I was interested in trying the food in the Peppermill diner one evening. I ordered a ribeye steak dinner which set me back about $35 including a coke and tip. I wasn't really impressed with the meal at all. Salad was terrible, baked potato dry and old and the mushrooms were disgusting (I love mushrooms btw). The steak was the only thing that kept me from returning the meal. You can easily find steak dinners all around Vegas for under $10. They probably have better choices on their menu but I advise you not to order a steak dinner here. Herbs and Rye off Sahara can fill that void if you feel like splurging on a proper steak.

Veggie Omelet - The ingredients were great but the omlet itself did not hold up well meaning they added to much liquid (water, milk...i dunno what it was)  Overall, the food isnt very expensive but the portions are huge.  It did lack a lot of flavor but it wasn't horrible.  It would be hard for me to recommend this place for food.    I would recommend the lounge.

Oh man too bad this is a little north on the strip because this would be my go-to prefunk drink when I am hitting the strip but at least an option for nights at the Wynn or Venetian.  The funny thing is that Rhumbar at Mirage sells Scorpions for $46!!  The place itself is pretty cool with the fireplace and big comfy chairs with 80's and 90's music videos playing. I did not have any food but they have free peanuts on the table. It is a little small and be careful not to leave the place driving because it is swarming with cops.",

    "text": "I have not been to the Peppermill since before yelp was on the internet and every time I did go it was after a long night partying or out drinking where to be honest anything tastes good. Not so now, I had buddies of mine coming into town Friday morning and of course they could not check in to the hotel because it was too early and they were both starving for some food. I wanted to stay on the strip and suddenly the Peppermill came into my mind, I know they are open 24/7 and they serve breakfast. So upon arrival (it was around 10am) we rolled up to the Pepermill and were greeted with a 30 min wait time and the reception area was packed with people waiting.   Then I remembered the lounge out back that serves some of the best Bloody Mary's I can remember having, so off we went to spend our wait time in the lounge.  man I'm glad I did, it was exactly like I remembered it pink and purple neon everywhere and the small water fire pit in the middle....Classic. Our waitress came and took out orders quickly and then returned with them just as fast, the Bloody Mary was exactly like I remembered them and you get at plethora of choices for your vodka, anyway we had two drinks each while we waited and was then called to our table. Our waitress gave us ample time to look and order from the menu which I was surprised at seeing as the place was packed, I was  expecting her to rush us and get us out of there. the portions are HUGE! and can easily be shared, I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs, there must have been a pound of corned beef with a crispy crust and three, yes three fried eggs on top.    Mmmmm The corned beef was crispy on the outside but once you cut into it, it was moist and creamy then once you cut open one of the eggs and the yolk mixes into the corned beef I was in heaven. I wish it was closer to my house so I could go more often but for anyone on the strip and bear in mind the Peppermill is located quite far down the north of the strip across from Circus Circus and the old Riviera it is still a must go to for a great meal ANYTIME of the day or night.",

The service is pretty quick, and the staff is nice.   Food is great, large portions at a reasonable price. Exactly what you would expect from a diner.   The lounge area of the restaurant is cool, it's got a very swingers vegas feel to it. Large velvet couches and a indoor fire set the mood for relaxing and making out haha.   I didn't try any of their drinks but they looked like they had a nice selection of cocktails.   All in all this is a fun place to go for late night drinks and food or morning breakfast or lunch.

With everything from the neon lights to the boldly colorful booths and the fluorescent table sugar, this place will make you feel like you've arrived in the city and gone back in time.  Not to mention, it's also one of the best deals on the Strip. For $13.50 you get a lot of food. I'm partial to the omelets, which are huge and come with a hefty portion of hash browns and toast/muffins. My two favorites are the Maserati and the Marco Pollo.   The hash browns are thicker than any I've ever had. It actually feels like I'm eating pure potatoes--not overly buttered ones.  This place has the classic diner feel, but better food and heartier portions. It's pretty packed, even in the graveyard hours. And every once in awhile you'll catch a famous face sitting at one of the booths.  I definitely recommend the Peppermill for anyone who wants to get that iconic Vegas feel when coming into town.",

Customer service was good, and the seafood omelette I had was excellent...  Now for the interesting. A couple next to us came in soon after we did & immediately the guy began badgering his girlfriend from an argument/disagreement they had earlier n the evening. Now arguing is 1 thing but this fool made the woman cry, she ran into the bathroom, he chased her in there and the continued to argue and berate her back at the table. So to the pretty lol blonde with the person of unknown color boyfriend with the Trump misogynist complex, I am truly sorry I didn't speak up and stop his foolishness earlier, I try and stay out of people's affairs but your crying, the berating and disrespect had become enough. He obviously seemed comfortable doing that and probably wasn't the 1st time but I hope you realize your worth and never allow it to happen from him or anyone again, but I hope my interference didn't instigate any further verbal or physical altercation once you had left the restaurant.  So yea good times and interesting hour at the Peppermill lol",

I was spending a short getaway at Encore next door. This is the land of $20 MGD and $26.99 omlettes, so I was itching for a more lowkey place with some real down and dirty breakfast.  I took an uber , but it was  actually a short 8 minute walk from encore. There is plenty of parking and an unassuming exterior. The inside definitely has an 70's acid dream meets the wizard of oz . On the left there is a small bar that plays 90's MTV and firepits lit in hot pink! I ordered two bloody marys which were very inexpensive and very tasty.   When you're called you either get a booth or table. You get to basque underneath some pink cherry trees as some bright LCD TV's play calm images of tuscan villas or underwater coral reefs.  The food is exactly what you expect. Nononsense large portioned diner food. Good thing it's not too oily or heavy, but definitely fits that home made .  I would love to go after raging at a club at 5 in the morning . Im sure you would get a bunch of characters as well as get an interesting story  to go home with!",

    "text": "Picture the movie Casino, which may stir up images of how Las Vegas looked before the turn of the century. Before almost every casino, bar, and restaurant either became 5 stars, a total dump, or was owned by some big conglomerate, there was something in between. The Peppermill, my friends, is just that.   The Peppermill is a piece of history. Nostalgia if you will. It brings back memories of days gone by. It's nothing fancy. It's simply an old school diner, with old school vinyl booths, waitresses, and colors in a non-pretentious setting that probably hasn't changed in some time. The food is typical diner fare and nothing that will blow your socks off, but I must say that my Denver omelette reminds me of something that even Fred Flinstone would have a hard time finishing.   The prices, although more than an average diner, aren't too bad, especially compared to some of the lush Vegas breakfast buffets. The Peppermill is located down the strip in front of the Riviera, which means having to fight large crowds and hungover tourists is minimal and an added bonus!   If you're looking for fresh coffee, fresh eggs, and a side of personality in a casual setting, then look no more. You have reached your destination.",

Portions here are so big, I think you pretty much have to split it with someone or be prepared to take it home. Prices are reasonable comparing it to the portions you get.   The only downfall to this place which I feel doesn't take away from the rating is the long wait to get a table. Some suggestions are to call ahead, they are usually willing to put you on the list or hang out at the lounge and start out with cocktails. That's never a bad idea.   We came here for breakfast and the omelettes were huge. Probably made with 8-10 eggs and full with ingredients in every bite.   We will definitely comeback and bring lots of hungry friends.",

We were afraid the food would be expensive and disgusting but our party of 10 was pleasantly surprised that it was delicious and fairly priced.

Although they were not busy they sat us way way way in the back next to the family with screaming/hellbent children that were literally kicking glasses of water on the table. yeah kicking w/ their feet, why you ask? b/c they were standing on the table.    Notice there was some garbage items on the floor when we first got in there, later saw a guy sweeping them up. Looked at the menu, tried to decide on some real diner food. No grilled cheese on the menu?  No tomato soup?  Ordered the Gyro with fries, friend ordered a salad with a grilled cheese [they can make one]  and my veggie friend ordered the Caprese sandwich [she had some issues finding something to order and mentioned it wasn't very veggie friendly]  Gyro arrived and it had this clumpy Tzatziki sauce on it made out of onions and something. It wasn't very good.  It was also very greasy.  I pushed some of the white slop off the top and ate the meat out of it.  The pita bread was soggie from the grease :(.  and it was also missing lettuce.    Everyone seemed to be ordering the sundaes.  Walked passed a guy who had his tennis shoes OFF and was eating his sundae, GROSS.  I wasn't that impressed.",

It is a Vegas must, open 24 hours and known for its large kitschy drinks and breakfast items. I lived in Las Vegas in 1998 when they were still building the Bellagio, and the Strip looked very different. I remember well coming out of the lounge side of the Peppermill, having eaten their Ambrosia French Toast or their pancakes, and seeing the retired strippers in their therapeutic tennis shoes and their car wash skirts with suspenders running pots of coffee around the restaurant side while the counter was lined with pilots in their uniforms. The restaurant gets busy now, but it has always been popular, and I visit when I can.",

What the double F? I walked down the block to the shady part of the strip and found peppermill. This is my 3rd time in Vegas. I don't venture to this part of the strip often but im so glad i did because the drinks were cheap and everyone sitting at the bar was a service industrustry worker. 5 stars plus a trip to heaven and service industry paradise. Didn't order food but got Fri is and drank a bloody Mary amongst multiple beers at 3am",

Just had a beer at lounge area while waiting for our food table, it was crowded at almost 5 in the morning. This place looks so old school Vegas, WTH.... The food wasn't so good, not a good place for Vegetarians or Pescetarians....:( service was extremely slow, but our waitress was friendly.

The decor is pretty cool; it's definitely much more interesting than the average 24 hour diner.  There's a photographer who goes around and takes pictures. But seriously, I'm not coming here for the decor at 3am; I'm coming because I need some food after a night out.    The food is extremely mediocre; I'd even say that it's below average in quality.  The portions are large however, but who cares how much you get when you can't eat something because it just doesn't taste good?  I understand that this place isn't gourmet, but I definitely expect food that's at least on par with the average diner.  I'd rather go to Mickey D's to eat than this place.",

    "text": "My wife and I had in planned anniversary dinner for May 27th  which was a Sunday, our guests arrived before we did (830pm) all WOMEN of African American descent. My guest asked  for water in which they were not given,   The manager Mo told them they had to order 1st before they can get water. They were even asked to leave when \"me an my wife\" did not show up @830, But we had a live Professional Photographee who arrived @ 8pm and checked in for us and they were still they were not treated fairly thewaitress Leilan did not make any attempt to settle the issues at the table was having. She in fact said \"that if we didn't like the service or if we were unhappy we could go somewhere else\". which I thought was not customer service at all, and that is not how you handle customers issue! From here we were ask how we would be paying for the table because there was about 8 of us and they don't split checks so everything has to be on one bill(which was understood before arriving to the establishment) we said that was fine and that we will be paying cash, Leliae said I was fine and then a few minutes later came back to the table and as for a debit or credit card to be placed on hold which is odd I've never heard of this being done at a resturant. Especially since we weren't sitting at a bar we were sitting at a lounge, so having an open tabs or and open credit card should not have been necessary I'm very curious now as to if this is a policy that they follow. Because we also watched another group come down and sit we payed very close attention to if they were also asked to put a credit card or debit card on hold and for some reason that never happen. Then we also notice that that table was a group of white people were as we were all 8 African American decent women. We had a live professional photographer a for who was going to capture as very special moment and make it very memorable for me and my wife. The pepper mill was absolutely rude and uncommodating and by far the last time 8 African American women  Will spend their money. And to add the table that was to are right prior to Arrival had witness the entire enteraction an the experience my guest had to go through and they got up and left and did not buy anything and also apologize to my guest for how they were being treated.  The bill turned out to be a $108 which was not at all expensive  On the receipt it shows that the time we checked in was at 9:24 p.m. when  In all actuality my guest arrived at 8:30 p.m. their request for water was refused at 8:45 p.m. and  arrived at peppermill @ 9:20 p.m.  Pepper mill has displayed their self to have races tendencies and they do not care about the African American and their money I will never and my guest will never spend another dime at PEPPERMILL LOUNGE RESTUARANT!!!  And being a person who loss a friend in October 1 shooting and this is how Vegas restaurant treats there Locals?! By FAR THE WORSE RESTURANT EXPERIENCE! PEPPERMILL WAS A RECOMMEMDATION FROM Local First Responders and this is one for the books.",

In a circle booth with a table that was bolted to the floor. Now I'm a fat ass so when I tell you that I was SQUISHED in that booth....I was squished in that booth. What I didn't like is that there is a cocktail waitress and a food waitress. You can't order drinks unless you order them through the cocktail waitress and her tail was nowhere to be found. We ordered the sampler platter and split it. It was HOT and the same quality of Applebee's (yes, put your nose in the air food snobs!) I was hungry and it hit the spot. Friendgirl thought it was really good, but I think that she was just hungry too, although she tends not have the discerning palette that I have. Would I come back, nope because Denny's is next door and I would have rather had that. It's okay if you just need something quick and inexpensive, but with so many restaurants on the strip......",

I have been going there since 2013 and i cant think of a single instance that we didnt have to wait a very long time for a drink refill. From the first time when i went there for a lunch date, the place was empty but still a long wait, to the time i went with 15 people for a work outing, the servers did lag.

They are open 24 hours, and have a super cool little lounge that was filmed on Gigolos (If you haven't seen it google, no judgement here :))  We ordered sandwiches all round, with sweet potato fries.  Everything we had was a super large portion and very tasty.    The lounge part is my favorite with a big sunken in room with a large fire pit right in the middle.  Drinks are reasonable, and service was fast.  Def. a cool little spot to get your grub on at 3a.m. or romantic spot for drinks.  Loved it!",

Fast forward-ing to Steve Wynn's Vegas of 2014 can be dismally unsettling and attempting to get ANY real dinner past 10PM will end up being a disappointing if not downright depressing quest.  Pretty ironic given the shows let out between 10-11.  Enter Peppermill..  Best thing I ever did was ask my cab driver where to get a steak dinner after a show at the Westgate, he dropped us off at Peppermill and stepped into the Vegas I know and love.  The food, full steak dinner, fabulous ambience, and the place was packed with like-minded late-night eaters.  I remember Peppermill from Santa Clara of the mid 1990's - I hear it's gone - it was the same place as this, though randomly placed across Intel, HP, AMD buildings- an oasis/breath of fresh air amid a rapidly developed Silicon Valley locus, same vibe, same neon, all good....",

It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!",

They are definitely priced on the higher end, but it's expected considering they are on the strip, it's a tourist attraction, and the portions are humungous. The only downside- this place can get very very busy and you may wait a while! It's best to go during the week or late at night to avoid large crowds and waiting. Otherwise, this place is awesome!

(By that I mean off the strip, for all us tourist folk)  I have been wanting to go there for a while now, and it did not disappoint. The decor was dark with neon light accents everywhere. Mostly of the blue and pink variety. The bartenders were up there in age, so they knew how to entertain and keep conversation going. I forget the bartenders name that was serving my girlfriend and I, but he was a good time.  My girl and I ended up finding an open spot at the indoor fire pit so we lounged there for a while. It was interesting... Great for people watching and you get one eclectic crowd walking in and out of there. All sort of race, creed, gender and class. It is now a must go to every time I head to Vegas. If you are the clubbing/ bar hopping type, its the perfect place to sit with the guys and plan your strategy over some good food and a few drinks. On the other hand, its a great place to just sit after a long night/ morning and well, lounge.",

The waitress advised a short stack because she said they're kind of big.  She wasn't kidding.  The 2 pancakes overflowed the big plate!  That said- the actual quality of the food was left something to be desired.  The huge pancakes tasted a little cardboardy.  In addition the service wasn't so friendly- maybe it was too early in the moring.   Maybe we'll give it a second chance when we go back to vegas.  The people who went late night or for dinner in the fireside lounge seemed to have a better experience.  But with so many options in Vegas, not sure it's worth it to give them a second chance.",

Plus, when you get there you're probably loaded.  So deciding to have breakfast in a place that looks like a strip club is an experience to be had.  Last time I was in Vegas, I stopped here for breakfast the second I got into town and was not disappointed.  I am not sure what anyone else got, but I also didn't care--I got their biscuit breakfast and it was awesome!  My time there was cut short cause my brother and sister got into a cab with a man that took them 15 miles out of Las Vegas and they needed to be rescued.  Of course, I made them wait to get picked up until I was done eating!",

    "text": "\"Because I want it twice in a 24 hour period....\"   Peppermill is the all-around best restaurant that you can only Yelp dream about at night and still obcess about it during the day.    I was introduced to Peppermill by my friend Jenny who is very particular about her food.  So, when she said she wanted to go to a 24-hour place that's so much better than Denny's, I mustered the excitement that I usually reserve for eating Del Taco (\"I guessssss, if there really is nothing elese....).  Upon arrival, you find that it was probably designed by a strip club interior designer:  Neon lights from ceiling to floor and under the tables, mirrored ceilings, sectioned off booths.  Yep, this is Vegas, baby!    But, the food, oh the food!  I started with the \"waffle ambrosia\" which is a Paul-Bunyan sized waffle covered with fruit and whip cream.  The waffle has this ultra soft inside, crispy outside, and the cake batter is soooo good...The fruit ambosia is a complete cocktail of freshly cut fruit of strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, grapes, pineapple, and bananas.  And you can tell they just cut it right now...as in 5 seconds ago.  And, if you're not a waffle person, the pancakes are just as good.    So, what else?  Because no person is full on just waffles (I can barely eat half)....  Bone-in Ham Steak:  Do you love ham?  Do you hate ham?  Who cares?  This ham steak is so thick and juicy that you wonder why anyone bothers to eat that sliced sandwich ham stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too with grill marks.    Nachos:  BIGGEST NACHOS ever!  Warm chips!  Big chunks of meat!    Omelets: They use 10 eggs in every omelet and it's so fluffy and yummy... awww....  Ice Cream Sundae for $8:  I have no idea why anyone would want to order this.  Why does anyone order an $8 ice cream sundae?  Now I know.  It's like 3-4 servings of Baskin Robbins sundae...with two bananas and the best strawberry ice cream with real strawberry chunks.  There's chocolate and vanilla ice cream and good nuts and a boat load of whip cream.   Honestly, every dish is like the perfect dream: the quality is super high, the food is super fresh, the portions are way too big for one person, and you'll eat food in a way that you wonder why there are even other restauants open.  After awhile, you don't know what to order because you crave the waffle ambrosia but you also want some ham-steak.  The last two times we were in Vegas, we had to have it twice a day...No food can really compare.    And the best part?  A dinner for six with drinks is just a little under $100 with tax and tip.     And strangely enough, every single waitress is really giddy and sincerely nice.    (Peppermill, if you happen to read this which I know makes no sense because I'm assigning human qualities to a restaurant, then please open one in Sourthern California).",

Nice and polite staff -  Great food -  and depending on the dishes you order; Giant portions.  I have a few dishes and I consider the caprice sandwich [I think its name is the caprice] is the worst dish I had; while the reuben sandwich is practically the best you could ever have.  While its not like the top restaurants at the Aria and the Wynn; you will not be disappointed at the food they have there. If for nothing else, the outfits the waitresses wear do make the experience that more enjoyable.  If you ever have a chance to to anywhere to eat in las vegas, I would greatly recommend the peppermill.",

I also yelped it BEFORE I came and it had my MANDATORY 4 stars! The only weird, \"negative\" thing would be the fake flowers everywhere. I kept hearing Robert Irvine from restaurant impossible in my head \"these fakes flowers gotta go!\". Other than that, no complaints whatsoever. Service was good. Prices were good, STRIP prices, so it's not cheap, but not over the top strip prices either. Food was pretty damn good too. My cousin got the pastrami sandwich. It looked really good. Large sandwich and lots of fries. He also got the margarita with the corona in it. I'd seen those in SA (wish I got one there). He really enjoyed his meal. I got the tomato, mozzarella and basil on \"toasted\" ciabatta bread. The bread could have been toasted more (but that's my preference). The pesto was tasty. There was a really nice amount of fresh mozzarella. The tomatoes could have been better. They were a little mushy, but when eaten as a sandwich, you didnt notice. I got onion rings (LOVE THEM!!!!) as my side. They were very good. There just wasn't too much to offer vegetarians, but I would recommend and might come back!",

Sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but once you get over all the things people HATE Vegas for, you realize how amazing this Postmodern Paradise is in all its glory.   That said, I'm so happy that a place like Peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here.   This place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there's a Canter's in Vegas, but if Canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. The ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! Just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding.   The menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24/7 diner-like place should have. Prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day. By the time we got there, we were all FAMISHED.   The varied menu made it hard to choose, but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I've Made in My Short Life. It may have been the fact that I was super hungry, but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy. I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. If I was challenged to marry the thing, I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the \"honeymoon\" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. It was that good.   Oh, I sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good.   But back to my sandwich. I don't know...we may have been caught up in the moment, maybe it was just good timing. I don't know if I were to return, things would be the same, but maybe...just maybe, I'll give it a try.",

He just wanted to stare at her cans!  Well, the cocktail waitresses must be wearing the same black polyester low-cut/high-slit dresses.  My cocktail waitress, Maribel, was cute as a button and well-stacked.  I was wondering what the interview process was like for the cocktail waitress job.  I should have asked, but didn't.

I think it's because there are do many great places to get dessert in this town,  I'm surprised when something on the Strip disappoints. I would go back, the lounge and entrees are throwback classics. And we really enjoyed the server.  Just know there are better sweets all over this town.",

The breakfast menu was extensive and the feta cheese and vegetable omlette caught my eye. Artchokes at a restaurant that looks like a strip club? Yes please!! I saw they had a meal with turkey sausage but it wasn't listed on the 'Sides' menu. Plus a side of meat was $5 and so that wouldn't have won anyways. The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top. We both managed to take half of our meals to go and they fully fed us the next morning too. For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.  I would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us. Not only did one member have a giant 1L bottle of watter with him, but he also put on his sunglasses 5 minutes after they arrived. A hangover at its best! But what's with the coloured sugar??",

The service was also mediocre, but it was super busy as it was Easter morning. This is one of those places you take people just so they get a chance to see it and say they've been there, but it's not really the place to go if youre looking for a high quality breakfast.",

    "text": "What a cool place!  The Peppermill, particularly the Fireside lounge portion, is like being transported back to 70s Vegas.  Lots of neon lights and plush seating.  They have a cool water based fire pit.  Hard to describe but very cool. Its a nice lounge to order drinks while you wait to be seated to eat.  The restaurant portion is also very unique with fake plants making it feel like your eating in some odd cross between the jungle and a Dennys. For food, you get a ton of food for your buck.  So its awesome by any measure. The food itself wont blow you away but its solid fare. I ordered biscuits and gravy and its a TON of biscuits and gravy.  I got sides of eggs and hashbrowns (if you want it crispy I recommend you ask for that as mine were kinda soft) and I couldn't finish half.  While we were there we tried both the mimosas and the bloody marys (if you get an extra shot, then its def a stout drink!) and we enjoyed both.  Our service at both the lounge and the restaurant was excellent. Our waitress was particularly good and on top of her game.  The peppermill is def a gem that will recommend to others looking for good food after a hard night, or morning, of drinking and gambling.",

This last time I got the crab eggs benedict meal.  Crab, poached egg, hollandaise, english muffin.    I took a group of fellow realtors here after our last day of a convention and everyone loved their food.    They are good portions as well.   The service is stellar every time I am there.  They have cocktail waitresses and separate food waitresses.    If there is a wait to be seated you can sit in the fireside lounge and have a beverage.  They'll bring your drink to your table if your table becomes ready before you get your drink.  Food doesn't take forever to come out of which I am a fan.    Even other people who patron the place are nice and want to converse with you.  I guess good food, good service, and quick service will do that to you.  Anyway, go here! I don't leave Vegas without visiting.",

So I checked the Yelp Las Vegas and Instagram reviews and it got a green light. We spied on the table close to the door and the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" with Ground Beef looked amazing! So of course we checked reviews and ordered the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" as well. Now let me tell you were it went wrong: Our server insisted that the Ground Beef was way too greasy and we should get it with Chicken. That my IG friends was a HUGE mistake! The chicken was flavorful, but it was a mountain of cheese, chicken, and some of the strongest white onions I have encountered in a couple months. We had to ask for the refried beans and got no Sour Cream or Guacamole. We regretted not ordering the Greasy Ground Beef!  The Burgers were very good: Pastrami Burger and PepperMill Burger...burgers were seasoned well, not overcooked, and bread was fresh. I will good back next year, but for breakfast. ____ ____ #foodieontheroad #stlmetrofoodie",

The portions are huge - each dish is good for two people.   The first must-order is the Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. I know you're at a diner, but this is something you just can't get at an Italian joint. You'll see what I mean when you order it.   Next, I suggest the chicken-fried steak. It's probably the least healthy thing you will order on the menu, but you can feel better about yourself when you see the broccoli and cauliflower on the plate.   If you need a third dish, I suggest the sampler platter or anything with hash browns. Just don't order the Joe's San Francisco Special - our server recommended it and she has bad taste.",

Peppermill is worth getting a coffee or drink here if you're in the area.  It's scenic, although it's soul may be hidden underneath the polyster white cushions like a hushed Italian tone.",

The western fruit plate is big enough to feed the entire table.  My favorite breakfast is a tie between the Masserati omelette and Joe's San Francisco Breakfast Special.  The  Pork Sliders are also perfect and so are the huge Bloody Marys.    If you have to wait for a table (and even if you don't), you should have a pre-meal Bloody Mary or Mimosa in the Fireside Lounge.     The service is great and everyone is very friendly.  This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Vegas.  Also my favorite breakfast Bloody Mary and Mimosa (fresh squeezed orange juice).",

Although our server lacked the experience to rectify the problem, she tried to take care of it. They get one star and not a negative five because our server, Cheyenne, was a trooper, she tried to stay positive & smiley. The manager, only after reading my horrible comment card, came back over & tried to attempt to actually hear us the second go round. Whatever won't be back!!!

The first thing I noticed was the low, neon lighting everywhere. My attention quickly moved onto the skimpy retro style diner attire all the waitresses were wearing. It kind of gave off a bizzaro \"Hooters\" feel. On top of all that, I had arrived at 6 pm, apparently the tail-end of the early bird hour, as the median age of the clientele appeared to be approximately 82. Ah, Vegas. Where else can you see a retro neon hooters full of octogenarians?  Onto the food: I opted for the Philly cheesesteak with onion rings, and it was tasty, freshly prepared, and HUGE. I downed everything on the plate, but I had no regrets. My sense of accomplishment was only enhanced when I got the check. This place is a winner, folks.",

When we walked in and asked about vegan options they looked at us like we were crazy but offered some of there standard dishes without meat and dairy.  Since we were with other folks who were not vegan, we had to eat something so we tried modifying a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich without meat and cheese.  What came out of the kitchen was a cold bun with a couple slices of tomato, a few pieces of uncooked bell pepper and onion and side of fires.  No seasoning was added to the veggies to try and make the meal eatable for us... and we were charge full price, $13.99 for our \"salad\" sandwich.  The non-vegans who were with us ordered Chicken Cesar Salad.  They complained that their salad had very little dressing and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  We had no time to complain to management since we had waited a long time for service and we had to leave to catch a flight.  This place is clearly another Vegas tourist trap not interested in return business.  Highly overrated.",

    "text": "Ahh the Peppermill, known for its 80's themed decor, with neon lights and colored sugar sprinkles. I have been to the Peppermill a couple times in the past few months only because I had friends in town. This isn't the type of place to hang out at often because it is pricey. The first time I was there for food, my friends and I were seated at a round half couch table in the back. It was very hard for me to get comfortable because the table is cemented to the ground so there is no way to get extra room. It was a snug fit. Next time I would ask to be sat at a table with chairs. Anyway to eat I ordered the chicken fingers platter, with fries, and my friends ordered a sandwich and french toast. The food came out quickly, they were not busy at all. I enjoyed my food, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The portions were hearty and the price was reasonable.  The next time I had friends come to town, we stopped here to check out the Fireside Lounge and get some drinks. The lounge is inside the Peppermill on the left, and is for the 21+ crowd only. It has plenty of seating, as well as a fire pit with some comfy couches surrounding it. We sat around the pit, and ordered drinks from the happy hour menu. Dirty martini's were only $4.50 each, and we also ordered mozzarella sticks which were like $6 something. The drinks were very good, but the mozz stix sucked. The ranch was BOMB though. This definitely is not the place to make as your local watering hole, but it is cool to stop in once when friends are in town.  One thing to note is there are NO prices on the regular menu at all for drinks. They have a lot of speciality drinks, with different syrups and add-ins, but again NO pricing, so you have to assume they are $$$$. (The pricing is listed on the happy hour menu for food and drinks though.)",

    "text": "Peppermill, ah peppermill. Not quite sure what kind of a theme they were going for here, but it definitely screams tacky.   The menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.    Service is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item.   I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all.   Oh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.  The chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?  I was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.  Bottomline, not bad for late eats, but a bit heavy on the wallet.",

We were staying at the Westgate and every restaurant inside the hotel closes early so we hopped a cab ride over to the Peppermill for good eats.  Enjoyed their breakfast menu - had a ham & cheese omelette and then a bacon/lettuce/cheese sandwich another late night. Both were delicious. Prices were average for a diner. Good service, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. Had about a 15 minute wait one day during brunch hours but that was to be expected. Enjoyed the tacky Vegas decor and they even have a separate bar/lounge area with a huge fire pit.  I would definitely return here while in Vegas.",

The staff was cussing up a storm right by the hostess area which never looks good on a business.  Food had flavor just on the smaller side which is suprising considering we came here because we saw huge portions on lunch and dinner items figured breakfast would be the same way or maybe the cook was skimpy that day who knows.   Would we be back again..idk maybe for lunch or dinner items but not for breakfast if I want a good big breakfast I'll be going ot hash house a go go at the linq for that from now on.",

    "text": "I am torn writing this review because on one side, this place has the coziest, most inviting and sexy atmosphere in Vegas without feeling pompous or \"upscale\".   The issue is that ...the food, service and cocktails are absolutely terrible.   I have tried coming here multiple times because it is indeed a great date spot, but they never deliver when it comes to the drinks they make or the food served.   The food options are basically your regular \"burgers & wings\" type. Not a single option for vegetarians/vegans. Even the salads would have to be modified. In this day and age it's rather archaic to not have a single option for such a large and growing crowd.   The cocktails may look pretty, but they always taste off for some reason. If you do decide to come here, get a beer or just a straight alcohol.   Expect to pay! Everything here is rather overpriced which is alarming how they charge so much for things here. Example:  A Chicken Salad will run you $17 A basket of Nachos $16.50  Entrees around $26   Yes...it's that ridiculous, especially for the quality of food you get.   All in all. If you are coming here for a drink, it can still be a nice date spot, the ambiance is really the reason this place still exists, quite honestly. But bring your wallet and take a deep breath when that check comes!",

I remember my family bringing me here when I was a kid. The thing about the Peppermill that I loved most, was the multicolored sugar crystals. It just made me feel like it was a happy place to be.  The food portions are definitely large, I don't think there's a dish here that is awesome, but the food is decent. Can you get better food elsewhere? Yes. BUT, I think the Peppermill is a must visit if you're in Vegas for the first or only time. This place is a part of Vegas history and there aren't too many old buildings left on the Strip.  There are food servers and drink servers here, so if you want an alcoholic beverage, it might be quicker to get it yourself at the bar. If not, your food server can send over a cocktail waitress to get you your poison.  The wait for a table can be substantial during breakfast/brunch hours, so I would call them at least an hour in advance to get your name put on the list. I'm not sure what the wait is like in the middle of the night, but if you're not traveling with kids, this is probably a great place to get something to eat/drink and wind down from the night's festivities.",

One of my favorite memories was coming here but going to the fireside lounge side on a date. We ordered giant scorpions and cracked jokes. It was hipster love. That was legit like 8 or 9 years ago. We would get late night breakfast, bring our drunk friends and family members here and also indulge in regular breakfast to cure that Vegas hangover.   Fast forward to the present, we still come here to eat. Sometimes it's with our 6 year old son. Sometimes it's with our drunk friends. My little guy loves the kid's pancakes with bacon. I go back and forth between the Joe's SF special, bacon and eggs or the corned beef hash. The muffins are SOOOO good. You can't go wrong with either. They are soft, warm, and delicious. Last time, I had blueberry and was not disappointed. The coffee flows freely and I love that it's not too dark and bitter.   The wait can get crazy. Don't be afraid to sit at the bar! I actually much prefer the bar but with little man, a table is easier. You also get a complimentary photo taken and drink service is handled by the ladies in evening gowns  This is the original! They're in a few different cities now, too. One thing is for sure, it's loved by locals and tourist alike. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "First and foremost, the wait is long so ask about the separate line for the bar seating; we were seated a lot faster in this line rather than our hour long wait for a booth. Very expansive menu but with that being said you have to watch what you order here. May want to go with what's ordered the most. I got the eggs benedict and although it wasn't the best Benedict I've had, I was full afterwards. I can't really say the food was delicious bc it was just pretty basic/bland. My husband ordered the Caesar salad and to his surprise he didn't like it-like how do you mess up a salad??? The wait staff is super busy so make sure you ask for what you need all at once otherwise it may be a while before the waitress can make it to your table again. We went here bc of the breakfast choices but later realized we should have went somewhere else. Probably won't be back on the next trip to Vegas.",

Just a heads up, many of the meals can be shared. I am so glad I looked at reviews before I ordered because the portions are insane. The menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming but at least you get options. My favorite was the French Toast Ambrosia! I normally do not like french toast but this french toast was not eggy at all. The fruit on top was so fresh. My husband got an omelet and enjoyed it. There is a bar attached with cute seating areas and TVs. They serve appetizers in the bar which makes it even better. The Peppermill is eclectic and different which makes it even better.",

    "text": ". TOP-20 TRIVIA ABOUT THE FIRESIDE/PEPPERMILL  Can someone add anything to 3,500 Yelp reviews about this iconic Vegas diner/lounge that every last local and a ton of tourists have already checked out? Can anything be said that hasn't already been said?   I'll give it a go ... with a top-20 countdown list of interesting trivia about The Peppermill/Fireside:  20. This place banked the owners enough money so that they could open and own their own Peppermill casino up in Reno. It's one of the nicest joints in town. And yes, it has the same loud neon decor on the casino floor as does this joint.  19. Yeah, every tourist in town wants to sit in the seats that circle the cool/kitschy water-fire-passion pit in the back lounge. Those seats aren't just sitting there empty waiting for you and your date to show up.  18. Robert DiNiro liked to hang at Fireside while making the film Casino back in 1995. Ther's actually two shots in the film of DiNiro & Stone sitting together at the Fireside fire-passion-pit, a short one in the film's opening, then a longer one when Stone asks DiNiro for a Benjamin so she can go powder her nose ... and then she comes back without any change.  17. The diner greeters/seaters and the lounge waitresses are always draped in low-cut, full-length, somewhat-sheer black gowns.  16. This place used to be more of a 'secret' local's joint decades ago, even though it's front-and-center on the Strip and next door to the side entrance of The Riviera. Before they demolished The Riviera, that is. At 4am you could voyeur off-shift dancers & casino workers, angels-of-the-night, cab drivers, Metro police doing 'lunch' and an entertaining variety of sorted Vegas characters. These days it is also a regular pit-stop for drunk tourists out of the clubs. So now there's even MORE Vegas characters for you to voyeur at 4am.  15. When the lounge is busy, they've got one of those old-school lady photographers wandering the floor offering to snap a picture of your party. Like they used to do in Manhattan at The Stork Club and the Copacabana back-in-the-day. I say go for it.  14. Yeah, many of the portions are huge. But not all of them. It depends on what you order. The large salads arrive with a circle of celery stalks sticking up into a point ... so that they sort of look like salad volcanos.  13. While you are waiting for your drinks in the lounge, the waitress will bring you an incredibly puny serving of peanuts to snack on. But if you tip her a bit up-front, you can ask her to be less stingy about it.  12. Not too long ago, a Vegas reporter lived in the Peppermill for 24 hours straight and then wrote a story about it.  11. The lounge has a lot of tiki-bar drinks on the menu like Mai-Tais and Blue Hawaiians. They're quite popular.  10. The original neon Peppermill sign, out on the Strip since the 1972 opening, was replaced in 2018 by an LED version. The original sign was donated to Vegas' Neon Museum.  9. These folks also own a small local's/retiree's casino called The Rainbow Club at the far end of Vegas over in the suburb of Henderson. It also has a 1970s decor, but its done up in a more subdued color scheme of khakis and browns.   8. No matter where you sit in the lounge, there's always a television screen very close by.   7. The signature drink in the lounge is their Scorpion. It gets eight shots of liquor that are whipped up into a half-gallon drink that looks and tastes like a cherry milk shake. It's served up in a brandy snifter the size of a goldfish bowl, meant to be shared by two with a couple of straws. Neither of them will be legal to drive for hours. The details of the recipe is supposedly a guarded house secret.  6. Jerry Seinfeld once shot an episode of \"Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee\" here.  5. The Peppermill once held a waitress reunion and over a hundred of them flew back to Vegas to attend.  4. A magazine once voted Fireside Lounge one of the most romantic lounges in America.  3. Supposedly, the carpet and seating fabric in the lounge has only seen one design change since the 1972 opening. The original carpet was shag orange.  2. Wanna meet up for a drink? Suggest The Peppermill. It's smack-dab in the middle of the city, small enough to easily find one another ... and every Vegas local & cabbie knows exactly where it is.  1. Peppermill management has a sort-of-kinky fetish for hiring diner waitresses with incredibly muscular thighs ... to complement the shorty-short blue jumper skirts they wear. Check it out.",

Came here after dinner specifically for dessert but they had some really yummy looking drinks that I wanted to try (maybe next time). The ambience was really nice they had a cute theme going on. I expected a fire pit because of the pictures but I guess that was the lounge which we didn't go to because they said they didn't have the full menu. Anyway, from the pictures, the banana split looked fantastic so I ordered that and my friend ordered the strawberry shortcake. When our food came we were in shock because they were massive! I mean I've never seen a banana split that big before. I guess I just wasn't expecting it. The waitress said it was big enough to share but dang it could feed a couple of people. Presentation wasn't too good. Couldn't even see the ice cream because of all the whipped cream but there was 2 scoops of ice cream for each flavor and you had to dig around for the banana. The strawberry shortcake was okay, not my cup of tea really. My banana split turned to soup because we couldn't finish it. Looking at the other tables all the plates were huge. All in all, it was a good experience. My tip would be to come here if you're really hungry. Will come back to try the rest of the food (to share ofcourse!)  PS. they gave a free souvenir photo of your table which I thought was really cute",

The pickles were delicious (and I typically hate fried pickles).  The mozzarella sticks taste like every other I've ever had.   We waited forever for our drink server to take our cocktail order.  Seemed strange to have to order our drinks with someone besides our waitress.    For our entrees, I ordered the barbecue cheeseburger, grilled medium rare with the onion rings. The burger was dry, but tasted good.  My wife had the BLT with avocado and French fries.  Both entrees were large portions.    Our Service wasn't the greatest.  We only had one shot to order cocktails.  We never saw the cocktail waitress again.    Overall, you should never leave the place hungry.  Big portions are served. However it wasn't worth the 'classic Vegas' hangout scene that we were hoping for.",

Stuck in the cool of the 80s with blue & pink neon,  pepper trees and 80s pop music playing low in the background.   I promise you're going to have a great time and the food is way more than you expect when you order it!  More than enough on every plate to share, but so many good things to choose that you have to order more than you can eat.  Cocktails served by a glamorous Vegas beauty in a long black evening gown looking like a starlet from a Hollywood red carpet. Who could say no?  If you are staying at the North end of the strip this is the spot to end your night of drinking and gambling.   If it goes back to value, this spot has value spade!  Thanks for reading my review.",

Agree with most of the reviews, that the environment is that older diner style, a lot of stuff going on with the neon lights, and flowers/trees, but i think that it goes with the whole old diner vibe!  Had a coronita Margarita that was delicious and paired it with the Peppermill sampler that as well was delicious!",

It's very retro and definitely old Vegas. The interior is beautifully designed with vibrant colors and their fireplace is also beautiful. My husband and I dined on a Saturday evening and the place was empty. Waiters and cocktail waiters were dressed very unique. The menu is simple, with breakfast offered all day. I had their buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had their fish and chips. Their plates are large! My husbands fish were large fish pieces rather than fish strips. With a lot of curly fries as a side!   You are also given a complimentary photo and are able to purchase larger photos for 20-25$. Overall, great experience, glad we visited here for dinner before our visit ended in Vegas. Located a little off the strip, definitely worth the visit to see the Peppermill and it's vibrant, retro, unique colors and styles.",

    "text": "Everyone talks about the Peppermill but I've avoided going because I don't really like diner food. My mom and I finally made the trip last night and although the food isn't anything special, the atmosphere and service was pretty awesome. On the outside it looks like a Sizzler. On the inside, it looks like a retro Vegas hotel bar. We decided to get drinks in the bar instead of being seated in the restaurant. As soon as we sat down a regular (I assume) told the bartender he would buy my mom and I drinks. I ordered a martini and the bartender asked everything from what type of vodka I wanted to shaken or stirred to what garnish I preferred. Stoli, shaken, olives. And I got 3 olives at that. We played video poker at the bar while 90s and 2000s music videos played on a TV at the center of the bar. It was relatively quiet on a Tuesday night but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The bar only serves appetizers so we ordered the sliders and 10 hot wings. Again our bartender asked us a series of questions about which condiments we wanted with our food. The sliders were standard, but with surprisingly cold patties for how slow it seemed in the restaurant. The chicken wings were better and the sauce was perfectly spicy. I wouldn't consider Peppermill a legitimate dining option but would definitely come back to the bar. It was a lot of fun listening to the waitress' drink orders for their tables. Some of the highlights: White Russian, Colorado Bulldog (White Russian with Coke), and Hawaiian Sunrise. The bartender knew his stuff and wasn't phased by any order coming at him. I'd do this experience again anytime.",

    "text": "Another \"milestone\" review for me... #500 on Yelp!  I had to devote a place I actually LIKE for #500!!! I'm a sucker for reality tv, reading books by celebrities, etc.  Holly Madison mentioned that this was one of her favorite places, and I think one of her reality show episodes had her peeps dining here.  This is also a favorite of the locals, so I visited this place for breakfast with friends a few years ago...the portions were HUGE, and we actually remembered this as being a \"favorite\" of ours.  Las Vegas has numerous restaurants to choose from so if you remember a good one...you'll want to return rather than taking a risk elsewhere.  I was back there this past weekend, and I asked my friend where she wanted to go for dinner...she didn't care.  Since we had a car this time I suggested Ellis Island, or Peppermill.  She's not much of a beer drinker, so I thought she'd like the ambiance in this place better so we stopped in again.  There is lots of parking in the lot here.  This place has a 70's roller disco kind of vibe to it... it's cute, totally not cheezy!  VERY \"Vegas\" I might add.  Of all my facebook check ins while I was out there...this place had the most \"love that place\" comments from my peeps back home.    Portions are HUGE here...you will not leave hungry.  The staff are great too.  This time we just got a few appetizers and drinks (we both ordered the \"bubble bath\").  There is a lot of mention of the nachos so we got those and barely made a dent in them, we got them with chicken too.  We also got the sliders which were very tasty.  I will absolutely keep coming back to this place when visiting Vegas, and you should too!",

The steak was lower grade, lots of fat (and not in the traditional yummy marbling way of ribeye steaks). The onion strings served on top were mainly just fried bread.  The mashed potatoes were fake. They even tasted fake. Probably the worst part of the meal. If I was a famous Las Vegas restaurant, I'd be embarrassed to even list mashed potatoes as a side option.  The sauteed mushrooms were probably my favorite part of the food.  The side Caesar was decent but had little dressing, and had to ask for more.  The water tastes like bad tap water.  I really liked the atmospheric diner charm.",

I have stayed at the Peppermill Resort in Reno and there used to be a Peppermill Restaurant in San Jose, CA. that I visited that all share the same look at this joint. I do not know whether they are related . Anyways this place is like stepping into a time warp. It has an old feel and neon as far as the eye can see (my photos have a pinkish hue). We sat in the bar area of the restaurant called the Fireside Lounge.   The drinks are cheap, the vibe is laid back and the nacho appetizer is a mountain of deliciousness. I dare you to finish it. The corn chips are layered with cheese, jalapeno, tomato, onion and black olive and came with a plate of ground beef and a plate of refried beans mixed with a nacho cheese. It is not fine dining but it is the perfect copilot for beer.  Between the vibe, beer and nachos I was one happy cat !!",

I tried the Southern Fried Steak and it hit the spot. Ample portion, but the taste was not compromised. I got it with hash browns and over medium eggs. The hash browns were crispy and the eggs were cooked properly. Both were good. Now onto the main event. The Southern Fried Steak had an acceptable amount of breading and \"healthy\" portion of beef rounds. Seasoning came through with the savory, yet not overly heavy, gravy sauce. I especially liked the hints of mushroom. This is a must try dish!   Others ordered the Veggie Omelette, Pork Loin with Eggs, and Crab Cakes. All said their food was good. They appreciated the value-based portions. Looks like most dishes are safe bets here.  Service was relatively prompt and friendly considering it was busy. Check this place out, if you want to refresh from all thee foo-foo restaurants on the strip.",

We had a pastrami sandwich and a club sandwich both with curly fries and both sandwiches were delicious! The curly fries were crispy and not really over seasoned, I can't stand it when they're over seasoned and that over powers the taste of the potatoes. The atmosphere is gorgeous it has a very 70's theme vibe but not dated at all (if that makes sense lol). The serve was attentive and friendly and they have a photographer walking around taking pictures if you'd like a picture memory.   We really enjoyed it and will definitely return to check out their dinners and breakfasts!",

The Peppermill is classic Vegas, think Sammy, Frank and Dean at the bar having a slice of Apple Pie and a dark coffee.   If you're familiar with Norms ( a famous institution in Los Angeles), you'll get diner quality type foods. I ordered just a basic cheeseburger as I wasn't exactly hungry, yet wanted to experience the Magic. Service was amazingly awesome! My waitress remained me exactly like Angie Bassett ( that's a HUGE compliment as I'm a film buff '), but had the demeanor of Bobby D in \"Casino\". Throughout the meal you have tons of stuff to keep your eyes occupied; the chandeliers, the photographer asking if you want a free pic, and oh yes..... the drink gal (s) who walk up and down the runway.  The actual burger wasn't \" amazing\", but \"good\". I'm the type of guy while eating, I had to think where did Jerry and George sit?  The Peppermilll, what's the deal with the decor?\"\" Thanks for making my Vegas trip the best thing I visited!    As a popular culture buff, The Peppermill gets a A+ from me!",

    "text": "As a Vegas local, the glitz and glamour of the strip can become...exhausting. When you're looking to bring an out-of-towner to a classic, old Vegas joint for a bite - you do the Peppermill. The portions are HUGE, the food is diner-y, and the staff's costumes are absurd.   On this occasion we over heard the hostess call another diner a 'dumb b*tch' to another staff member, and I was pretty disgusted. Not only should you never speak about a customer this way, there's no excuse for it to be done on the floor in front of other diners. Gross. I left a comment on the comment card at the table.   The french dip sandwich is so good that my husband gets it every time we go. I've tried some of the appetizers and the BLT - they are typical diner fare, so I'm still searching for my go-to meal at the Peppermill. The menu is arduous and nothing really pops out at you, because it's stuff you've seen before. I'm sure something will eventually tickle my tastebuds.   Along with the neon lights and indoor trees/garden - you'll find a container of sugar sprinkles on each table which is a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure why each table would need this at all times, but it helps to make Peppermill the Peppermill - and that's okay with me.  A note about the 'in-house photographer': You do not have to purchase photos from them. I don't know why this photographer situation irks me like it does - but I really despise it.",

    "text": "I came here with a few co-workers for my going away dinner. I've always driven by the Peppermill when I'm on this side of the Strip, but I've never actually stepped inside it. Upon entering, I was a bit surprised. From the outside it doesn't really look like much but once you step in, it's like entering a different world.   The inside was really cool because everything was bright and colorful, yet still had a dimly-lit feeling. The bright neon lights and the light above our table didn't make it seem as dark as it felt. I really dig the ambience to this place.   I ordered the pork loin and eggs. The dish consisted of 4 pan-fried pork cutlets, hash browns, your choice of toast, and 3 eggs of any style (I went with poached eggs). The pork loin was soft and tender. I'm sometimes hesitant to order pork dishes (especially pan-fried pork loin) because they run the risk of being hard, dry, and unappealing. The way the chefs cooked the pork here made the pieces easy to cut, and retain most of the natural juices and flavor. Bravo!  The hash brown shreds are bigger in size than most places that serve similar diner food. The poached eggs were alright, and is best eaten with the sourdough toast.  This is probably one of the places you should visit if you're ever on the north end of the Strip. Come for the unique ambience, but definitely stay for the great tasting food!",

Walking through the doors though, was a whole other world. It definitely resonates Las Vegas.  In the reception area you will discover slot machines, mirrored walls with lots of blue and purple neon lights outlining the different segmented areas.  On the right side of the restaurant is standard seating for groups, families, etc. decorated in some nice greenery.  As I walked towards the entrance to the left of the restaurant, that area is known as the Fireside lounge.  Throughout the lounge are circular table settings with a fireplace in the middle. The atmosphere reminds me of what I would imagine of the early heydays of Las Vegas. It was appropriate to dress up to the nines and hit the town and I imagine this lounge to be reminiscent of that era.  I was there to enjoy some drinks with my other Zapponian co workers and we ended up ordering some food as well.  The wings were good but I'll be honest, the drinks took a little long to arrive. I ended up opening two tabs and ordered from the bar.  Other than that, I had a great time.  If you want to lose yourself and find a themed restaurant, put this on the list to visit, it's on the strip and it perfect for something different and yet a bit intimate.",

It is surprisingly clean, although the carpet definitely could use updating.  I dogged the faux trees and flowers.  The food was very good.   My kids had a waffle, that was loaded with fresh fruit and delicious, and my eldest one had a tasty burger.   We were pretty disappointed with the $13 shrimp cocktail that had 5 shrimp.   That is over $2 a shrimp, probably the most expensive shrimp I had ever had.  I that is why I took one star off.",

They still have the multi-colored sugar on the tables! This was one of the most memorable touches that I recalled from Peppermill form years back and was happy to see it still alive at the Peppermill VEGA$. IF you hunger and looking for bold and hearty portions, this is the place for you! I ordered the Red Pepper Pasta - whoo... spicy hot and so flavorful! I couldn't even finish it, it was so much. Prices were a bit steep, but considering you can easily get two meals from one portion, I say great deal.  Service was good, nothing exceptional in fact it did take some time for our servicer to greet us at the table but once she did, it was good thereafter. I think because the Friday night we went they were extremely busy, the staff were all buzzing around like bees, even the cocktail waitresses in their evening gowns ;-)",

I don't care for it but all of my friends and family do, and they had to ask ahead of time. In fact it does come out of a can! Now me personally I think its gross either way, so I don't care!!  First off....know that this place will be packed pretty much anytime from 9am to 11am so if you're going for breakfast be prepared to wait! While you are waiting you can go sit in the lounge and have one of their signature cocktails or appetizers. These might just fill you up so don't indulge too much because you will still want to have the breakfast as well.  I know they serve lunch and dinner, but this is a breakfast only kind of place to me so I am basing my review as such!   Hits: waffles, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak, eggs benedict   Misses: corned beef and hash, fried selections (appetizer stuff), mixed fruit   I hate sharing this place because I know it will just become more popular and in turn busier, but I can't help it!! This place is awesome and I hope they are around for another 40 years!!",

    "text": "Terrible ! Terrible ! Terrible!  Let's start by saying the old female manager with the weird lips is a complete as*hole! The server couldn't even bring out the beverages correct .. I ordered soda water with lime! She delivered tap water with lemon .. 10 minutes later. great! My friend and I ordered our food and it literally took 25 minutes to come out. Once it did we had to ask for silverware. She dropped that off and walked away. Took one bite of food and it was cold. Had no heat at all. After sitting there for another 15 minutes with no service, I asked the next server I seen for the manager who came 5 minutes later. I explained to her how the food is cold and we've been sitting trying to wait but the server never came back so we began to eat, being that we've been here for quite some time. She tells me it's nothing she can do besides reheat the food.  Umm that would have been fine 15 minutes ago if SOMEBODY did a table touch like they was suppose to! However, I'm a server and have been for years and there is absolutely nothing acceptable about my service nor should I be forced to pay full price for my frozen food. Anyways, she brings the check and I proceed to the cashier to pay and of course it's little miss sunshine, lady manager.. I pay and obviously not happy about it and this witch had the nerve to tell me to never come back & she tells \"security\" to escort us out as if I've done something! Like Susan.. chill! Don't try to profile me! I wouldn't step foot back in that stanky, roach coach, awkward smelling, no service having, everybody in the sunken place establishment ever again! Y'all better tighten up cause phones, social media & dirty dining is something special, ain't it.. Good day",

Be careful with over ordering here. The portions are huge. I eat a lot in one sitting and the restaurants on the strip don't do me justice but I was overwhelmed with just the size of the appetizers itself.  I shared most dishes with the wife  Totally worth the money and be prepared to take left overs back.  Ambiance has neon lighting and after a while you get used to it and it's fun.",

    "text": "Ok first off I have been waiting almost 10 years to get the chance to come try this ultra cool classic dinner/lounge of Las Vegas. When I finally did I think the hype was just way too high.   The Peppermill is a dinner slash lounge and when I first moved here in my hey days friends and family always suggested The Peppermill as a late night hang out or a cool place to grab food and more drinks after a long night out. They might have been a bit on the drunk side every time they were there though lol. Anyhow fast forward about 10 years later a wife and 2 kids later life was totally different and friends too now have families of their own.  After numerous try's to eat here for breakfast with families from out of town has been unsuccessful I finally got that break. A friend and his wife and kid was visiting and after a night of taking our kids to the Nostalgic Circus Circus we ran out of options places to eat and then  I remember THE PEPPERMILL so there we headed. We get there and the parking lot was quit bare and I am celebrating at this point.   Walking in we were all excited for this experience and couldn't wait to see what was in store. Like another fellow Yelper said inside of the Peppermill totally gives off a Strip club vibe which was a bit funny because we had our 1 to 3 year olds with us. Note that even though it is a lounge on one side it is a totally kid friendly place with a kids menu at that. We were seat fairly quickly and food came out at a reasonable time. Though it was not that busy. Service was friendly and food came out in big portions. All the food options on the menu sounded super good and they came out pretty good but nothing over-the-top. It is a diner and I'm sure if I was out all night drinking and partying the food portion and flavor would be on point, but I wasn't so I am a little bit more critical. The food sizes were amazing and I can completely appreciate that but the taste was only a couple steps up from your typical Dennys.   Never the less we had a good time Anderson enjoyed our food. I will totally be back but if there is a wait what so ever I won't be waiting in that line. Next time I'm leave the kids at home and joining the other adults in the lounge so I can finally have my drunken late night experience I never got to have. Stay tune for that review update LOL!",

Lucky for you, there is an actual LOUNGE (with actual FIRE) off to the side of the host's kiosk. Go in there after you give your name, and enjoy a drink while you wait. Otherwise you'll be crammed up against Martha from Sheboygan and her husband, Herb, who lost a little too much at the penny slots and are throwing elbows and creating their own line for the counter spots (they're first come, first serve).  Portions are ginromous. Food is All-American. Haute cuisine, this is not, but satisfying to the American palate, it is.  Decor is fun, and this place is just kind of a fun gimmick. If you've got a tourist friend (or you are a tourist), looking for a \"gosh, that's fun\" kind of dining experience, then this is it. Think of it as an electric carnival 80s neon Denny's on acid.",

To top this off I usually go for orange juice or some sort of cocktail or beer if I'm in the mood for another drink. I'm a fan of diner type food and the food has that feel with a Vegas party atmosphere inside the restaurant. The prices are very fair also...great food at low price is always a good thing.

It is located by the Riviera & Circus Circus on the strip, so people are able to walk off their food afterwards because there is a lot of food coming your way!!!    1. Be prepared to wait-Giving any place in Vegas that is good and that does not have a reservation option, be prepared to wait.  There is not much seating areas up front so they will offer the lounge area to wait (highly recommended!) but usually everyone is waiting outside.  2. There are large booths & typical bar seating-There is plenty of room to sit and the decor is straight up vegas style!  If I blinked twice I would have thought I was in a party bus with trees!  I loved the seating arrangement and everyone was in a good mood and can easily talk to the booth next to you!  3. Waitresses were awesome (both times!) They let you know what is great on the menu and I did get everything in a timely manner...even though they were slammed!  4. Food for Days- For the first round, I received the breakfast pancake platter and the size of everything is incredibly huge!  You pay around 13-14 dollars, but it is worth it (especially if your hotel room has a fridge, you will have leftovers!)  The second round I got the French Toast Ambrosia...this I highly recommend!! French Toast with a whole bunch of \"fresh\" fruit on top smothered in whipped cream (if you want) with blueberry sauce!!! YUUUMMM!  This place does not disappoint!! I cannot explain about how much I love this place and cannot wait to go back!",

The portion size is worth what you pay, though.   The atmosphere is typical Las Vegas. A lot of neon lighting and mirrors. Very \"glamorous\" motif as you would expect for Vegas.   The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Overall, it was a good experience! I enjoyed my night out!",

It's technically on the strip, but definitely getting towards the sketchy end.  If you're looking for the \"old Vegas\" feel, definitely check this place out.  Once I kind of got past that, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  And the nachos are out of this world. Service was - like everywhere I go in Vegas - excellent.

    "text": "Visited the Peppermill for a friends birthday gathering on a Friday night. Was nice and busy but not enough to feel overcrowded, just enough to feel like you're in the action of the Vegas strip. The location is right off of Las Vegas Blvd, so you can expect occupancy especially on a weekend. Awesome date spot if ya lookin for drinks and are trying to impress the lady (my girlfriend brought me here in our early days, smart gal)  The lounge was pretty comfortable considering we packed a corner booth with almost 20 people. Ambiance was awesome and probably the main sell of the joint. Groovy and aesthetically pleasing neons tones and retro seating and interior furnishings. Not to mention they were bumpin' nostalgic music videos from what felt like former MTV bops. The waitress was extremely accommodating and patient for a group of our size; she got every drink order correct, checked on us regularly and made us feel pretty comfortable.   Drinks were great from what I gathered. The menu was cohesive and provided pictures, always helpful. Pretty sweet fishbowl option for the brave ones, fancy cocktails and beers. The cucumber drink seemed to be popular while I settled for a dead guy IPA in a bottle (delicious)  The only thing that keeps this place from fulfilling its potential is the lack of interesting dishes on the food menu. My impression was that it was very basic and easy dishes that you could expect at any restaurant/bar hybrid. With the glitz and glam of this spot, they could get away with an updated and modernized menu (in my opinion). Revitalized tapas and apps menu with creative or atleast interesting food options. Bacon wrapped dates, Shishito peppers, fondue, just some modern Las Vegas jazz you know?? It would complete the spot as a great date and general gathering destination.",

    "text": "I honestly didn't even know this place existed...I thought it was just a beat up old casino. But when I walked in, it was literally just a restaurant with a really small waiting area and a bar in the back. We came for brunch on a Sunday and it was packed...we waited around 30 minutes for our seats.   Right when we sat down, a cocktail waitress came by and asked us if we wanted any drinks from the bar. And when you look around you, everyone's ordering cocktails or a drink from the bar. I'm guessing that's how they make their money.   The decor is definitely something else...super retro. With purple and blue and pink colored booths and table. After we got seated, our waiter didn't come by until 10 mins later. We got a crab cakes as an appetizer. I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special and my boyfriend ordered the Pancakes with bacon and eggs.   My dish was definitely huge. It had scrambled eggs, spinach, sausages, onions, and a type of sauce. It was placed on top of a layer of hash browns. I think the dish was definitely overwhelming. Because everything just looked like a big blob of mess, I got full after eating 1/4th of the dish. The hash browns were definitely crispy and good! But the scrambled eggs and everything in it was too mushed together. I wish it was made separately rather than throwing it all in together. ($13)  My boyfriend's dish was good! The pancakes were a bit too crumbly. But other than that, the bacon and eggs were good! Like a regular breakfast plate. ($13)  The crab cakes were ok. Nothing too special. It came with a spicy mayo sauce. The display wasn't very nice. Looked like they just threw on a lettuce and put the crab cakes on and sprinkled it with some green onions. Not worth! ($9)  All in All, this place is ok. Its like a bit fancier than the Denny's right next door. And definitely not worth the wait.",

The only reason not a full 5 star was when we initially came in the hostess werent paying attention to the customers waiting to be seated. We waited a few minutes and had to make eye contact to get their attention. She then noticed another group of 6 sitting off to the side waiting. When the hostess asked them if they were waiting to be seated they said yes. The look on her face of shock showed she didnt know they had been waiting. Other then that small speed bump to start the rest of the experience and meal was wonderful. Will be back and if in town to visit Vegas certainly a look",

We recently came here during our Christmas break and dang! Their food is sure tasty, and comes in big portions! So for the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth. They give you so much food that you can share it with 3 people and STILL be full! Dang. Money's. worth.   I got their Marco Polo omelet, which was so tasty! Their sauce on top just made it so good, and the omelet is really huge! It comes with hash browns and your choice of bread. We also got their bagels, and woah. The bread was so fresh, that it was easy and smooth to pull apart. It made eating bagels a lot more pleasing.   Service wise, they are really great at getting to you! We never usually have trouble with service, and that's with saying being an occasional customer for the past 10+ years! It does get crowded, but they usually seat you quickly enough so you don't have to wait long.   The restaurant is very interesting to look at. Definitely reflects the busy like of Vegas, expect they have trees inside the restaurant. Very weird, but I can deal with it.   They have their own parking lot, which is great because there is always parking. Woo!   Come on by here for a great brunch after a night out of turning up at the clubs, or before you start venturing out into Vegas with a full stomach!",

Since I was a party of 1, I was able to grab a seat at the bar within the first 5 min of my arrival.  The bar seating gives you a birds eye view of the kitchen and all the action.  Those waitresses are very talented in how they balance and carry all those hot plates!  Portions here are huge and somewhat intimidating.  I settled on the basic breakfast: 3 eggs scrambled w/cheese, 4 crispy bacon strips, hashbrowns add grilled onion and wheat toast.  The bacon was a little on the skimpy side, but the eggs were nice and fluffy and well cooked.  Overall, a pretty decent dining experience.",

The lounge was only appetizers and drinks. I decided to wait since I'm in the mood for breakfast. We waited and I notice 2 seats available at the counter. Sat down and was waited on right away by Maribel. She was very attentive and the food came out quickly.   The diner has not changed since my last visit 2 years ago when I celebrated Christmas in Vegas. The portions are large. I could have shared the omelette as it is that huge. The salad was ok. The lettuce tasted old. The home fries were good. The prices are less than the hotel breakfast but this is Vegas. The bill was $33.77.   I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas.",

Kitsch everywhere with everything from silk flower trees lit up with fairy lights to multi-colored sugar crystals for your coffee. The food is great and the portions are enormous. The Fruit Plate will blow your mind. The Breakfasts and Burgers are excellent. The Pastrami Burger is my favorite. Waffles and Pancakes are large enough to feed a village. Definitely try the Lemon Muffin instead of toast (no up charge). The Nachos are a work of art.   Feeling 'Extra?' Have cocktails and huge portioned apps by the sunken fire pit in the bar area!  Peppermill gets 5 Stars because they are fabulous! This is my favorite diner in town - hands down! There's a reason they've been around so long.",

I love the details put into everything and the general feel of the place. The lounge is even more fun to enjoy. I come to the Peppermill every time I go to Vegas just for its uniqueness.   Now on the restaurant. Some of the food they serve is absolutely terrible. Like, worse than bad diner food from a place in the middle of nowhere (which is disappointing when you're paying $15 a meal). Some of the breakfast is great, but don't bother with any salads or appetizers. The drinks are also terrible. I ordered a coronarita which was literally a glass filled with ice and sweet and sour, which she then poured a half full shot into. I didn't even drink it because it tasted so bad.   The service here is also awful. Our server was short with us, barely greeted us, and made mistakes with the only two things we ordered from her. Both our water glasses also sat empty for 20 minute intervals (was only refilled once). Literally nobody pays any attention to you once you've sat down.   Truthfully I will only ever come back here to have a simple drink in the lounge (likely a vodka soda, because it's tough to mess that up, right?). I would recommend you do the same, or don't expect too much from the restaurant side.",

Once I walked into the restaurant I immediately felt like I had been transported back to the 70's everything from the music to the decor definitely had a retro feel. I ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger with fries. The food was good but nothing I couldn't get at many other places. The food seems like a higher quality Diner fare. Everything from burgers, steaks, nachos and much more. I didn't get the hot fudge sundae but I saw one and it looks like a must order next time.  I think the atmosphere and history are what keep this place going. The fireside lounge is a room off to the back of the restaurant and was a dimly lit bar with a fire pit right in the middle. The fireside lounge looks like a very cool place to just hangout and have a few cocktails. The food and ambiance were good enough I would definitely go back.   Atmosphere: 4.25 Stars Food: 3.5 Stars Fireside Lounge: 4.5 Stars",

Maybe it's because I'm from the South where we have stellar home cookin', but this place was NOT good. I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was NOT good.  My girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying.   Us: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there? Cabbie: Girl, you can CRAWL.  Nuff said. Let's go THERE. We got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll go to the 24 hour Indian place inside Riviera if I'm hungry in the middle of the night/morning. Too bad I didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there.",

Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day/night you're trying to get your grub on.)  Menu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.  I opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered \"good choice\" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.  Oh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me. Didn't even apologize after he did it and realized that it wasn't \"for everyone\". D.B.",

We almost got seated in the regular diner area and that is not the experience you should be looking for!  My boyfriend and I split a scorpion bowl and a plate of chicken strips and fries. Both were gigantic and plenty for both of us. They are particularly generous with their fries.  Our waitress was very friendly I loved the dim lighting and ambiance overall.  Only downside is that it wasn't a cheap cab ride there. But it is worth it, believe me!  Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas so I can get a seat right in front of the fireplace!",

The last time the service sucked (wasn't even busy)but we got over it and had a great breakfast. Now for the good, the bad, and the ugly.   We first went to the lounge which I have always loved. Service was slow but they were down a waitress but she was great and made us some good drinks. We made our way with our party of four to the dining room. And waiteddddd. I've seen much busier but that's was a little off. Finally they took our order which took an hour after to receive the food and we actually waited 35 min for the server showed up.   Being starving we dug in and that's where the trouble started. Cold food, condiments we didn't ask for, and and a LONG black hair in my friends sandwich! At that point we were done. We called the manager Ben over who was completely rude and condescending. We thought he would fix it. Wrong. We flagged him down and he gave us quite the attitude. We had no problem paying for drinks but not subpar, unhygienic food. Begrudgingly he comped the bill but we paid for our alcohol which was to be expected.   Due to his extremely rude dismissive behavior which I have NEVER had a manager do as they usually try to help I will never be back and it was my best friends birthday and it completely ruined her experience",

Fair warning bc it's an iconic place-been around since 1972...there is literally \"always\" a long wait 30-45 min minimum unless you have an in ;). But it's sorta part of the experience lol-just go in the back order a drink & hang out at the fire pit lounge-\"Casino\" & other movies were filmed there! The booths don't move so they're kind of tight sometimes that's my one complaint. The waitresses are always friendly & professional. I have my faves. Definitely a must go to stop while you're in Vegas!",

Huge portions, reasonable pricing, great service. Everything you want from a classic diner. I finally settled on the California BLT which was excellent. All the food that went by our table looked so appetizing it was a tough decision. Definitely a go to for a classic breakfast plate, everyone at our table was very happy and full.",

By the time we left around 10 am, the waiting area was full of people.  The service was prompt and friendly. After drinks were served, we were offered to be taken a souvenir photo but we declined. If you want the photo, it seems that the sample size (very small) is free, but you have to pay for normal size photo with a cover. Even though it was full house, we were constantly visited by servers for refills and stuff.   The restaurant is known for its massive portion of food. I ordered Pancake Combo which came with 3 stacks of pancake, 2 long breakfast sausages, 2 bacons and 3 eggs. It was delicious but nothing special. I was barely able to finish half due to its portion. My husband ordered Crab cake Bene which was a pleasant surprise. We've never thought to have crab cakes as breakfast but the salty and savory crab cakes along with creamy eggs were so delicious!",

They have a dining room where families can sit and eat.  They also have a bar called The Fireside Lounge. This is one of the coolest bars in Vegas! As the name suggests, there's a huge round fire pit, surrounded by giant plush, velvet couches. Reminds you of Vegas in the 70's.  The meals are huge, fairly priced, fresh ingredients, and delicious. They buy their ingredients, daily from local Farmers Markets.  Whether you enjoy beer, wine or mixed drinks.... Peppermill has it! I would suggest trying some of their house specialty drinks. The bathrooms are spotless, as well as the dining area.",

Having met up with an old college friend, I was already longing for the past and this place felt like a weird manifestation of what I was feeling. The pink and blue neon track lighting was the first thing to catch my attention. Once my eyes adjusted, I could appreciate the flamingo lamp shades, the plastic topiary and the waitresses' costumes.   In such a setting, it only seemed fitting to order breakfast for dinner with a dreamsicle cocktail. The portion was huge and I only ate half.    Through dinner we contemplated why this place is a restaurant and fireside lounge. So we sought out the fire which was ablaze in the center of a bubbling pool encircled by red velvet couches. There we settled into the night.   I am thankful to have a tourist photo to commemorate such an experience.",

Big plates, classic cocktails, and undeniable warmth; the way the strip used to be! **HAPPY HOUR every day from 3pm - 6pm.  50% off well drinks, wine and beer, and food specials. **INDUSTRY NIGHTS (w/ valid service industry ID) everyday from 12pm to 7am receive Happy Hour pricing.  LETS GET DOWN TO THE DETAILS; there are two sides to this place, the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Bar & Grill. FIRESIDE retains its 'old Vegas' ambiance, with red velvet seats, large artificial trees, mirrors on every wall and dim blue lights creating an alluring atmosphere. Its located just passed the dinning room; as you enter the bar, your eyes pull toward a circular lounge area with a warm flame that sits on top of a pool of water. Its the center piece of the room and my favorite spot to sit. The circular lounge area is also lined with TV's playing music videos from the past/present, great for entertaining and just relaxing. COCKTAIL WAITRESSES are stuck in the 70's with their long maxi dresses. Their cocktail menu consists of iconic and classic recipes, such as margarita, martinis, bloody mary's...etc And the bar menu includes shareable finger foods: nachos, chicken fingers..etc.  ON THE OTHER SIDE the RESTAURANT is a classic las vegas breakfast stop. Open 24-7. The menu still reflects BIG hearty dishes, and even includes some of the original dishes. Food taste is an average breakfast joint, and and plates are shareable. COME HUNGRY!   WHY 3 STARS? One word 'SERVICE'!! This is our 3rd time back to the FIRESIDE and I was hoping for a better experience. We went last night; and there were very few people in the bar area + 3 cocktail waitresses. You would think the ratio between 'people & waitresses' would work in our favor? Nope, they stood around talking to each other while we waited 10 minutes for service. CRAZY, huh!? Needless to say the service was so bad, we ordered 1 drink and closed out. For me, service is key to guest experiences, and a direct reflection of management. Unless something changes, this place is only a 3 star in my book.   Overall, the Old Vegas experience should drive you here! Hoping the service gets better at FIRESIDE, cause this place has so much potential!!",

Speaking of drinks, they have quite a few to choose from, lots of cocktails but unfortunately a rather poor beer selection, only Stella on tap, but they poor it well, so hard to complain. It's got two sides, diner with the full menu, then the \"lounge\" with the water/fire pit. I think your best bet is to go at the end of your night, when you're a little munchy, get a few appetizers and a nightcap then cab it home as the sun comes up.",

The retro feel is pretty cool too. We all got ourselves a French toast collage each and a big bowl of oatmeal to share cuz... why not? LOL! Huge portions here! Obviously, it was way too much food, but we stuffed ourselves anyway. Everything was prepared well, but the French toast wasn't the absolute freshest or softest I've ever had. Service is also kinda meh. What didn't help our hanger was them telling us it's a 20-25 minute wait and it becoming over an hour wait. We found out (the hard way) that they have two separate lists--one for small parties and one for large parties. We were a small party (3) and kept hearing other people being called, all the while they kept telling us there were only 2 parties ahead of us. That said, try to avoid peak times!!!",

When you walk in he hostess takes your name down and invites you to wait in a lounge (where I enjoyed a mimosa ) which has a really cool water/fire pit and music videos playing on flat screens above it ... so freaking cool!! We were called to our table shortly after and he restaurant was just as amazing , the ceiling and parts of the walls are lined with neon , the ceiling appears to be made of like disco ball material , there are these really  cool trees in areas of the restaurant , rainbow sugar , bomb food ... I can go on and on this place is a must try if your ever in the area. Food and ambiance was on point , loved this place !  I had the pepermill pancake combo, it's a large dish by you won't be disappointed, it comes With a side of eggs ( in a separate dish , loved !)  two sausage links and two pieces of bacon and of course a stack of three fluffy delicious pancakes with a side of maple  syrup. It was sooo good! I will come again for sure !",

You could see anything from a few girls passed out in their eggs, to folks doing business here at 3am- so the entertainment alone is priceless!  Our service was terrific, and the place has a fun funky feel with neon and floral everywhere!

It was the worse pancake I ever tasted. I was flat, tasteless, and overcooked. A frozen toasted pancake would have been better. The crab benedict was uneatable. The lukewarm frozen, probably microwaved crab meat make me feel sick. The hollandiase sauce has so much old bay seasoning it tasted powdery, as if I was just tasting seasoning. The hash browns were cold but I ate those because I was hungry. We left the food and ate somewhere else.",

I ordered a medium ribeye, but it came half medium well and half well done, even dry. The potatoes and veggies were average. Even with all the waitresses walking past me and looking at my table, none of them got my empty plates or refilled my water. It took a while for them to cash me out because the machine kept malfunctioning. The couple ahead of me gave a $5 tip for a $60 meal. While I never give less than 15% unless services are terrible, I don't blame them for that low tip. It was really poor service.",

The seating is arranged in these amorphous islands of booths, which makes us feel like we're all neon jellyfish in the middle of the ocean deep, and it's enchanting.   The diner food is also as good as it gets. The three of us discovered that we are all \"breakfast for dinner\" people, and we freaking chowed down, sharing parts of our ginormous meals with each other but still managing to clean most of our plates.  French Toast Collage - So good, and I'm so glad I got to share a couple of my squares so I didn't have to eat them all myself. Eggs, bacon, sausage, all perfect.  Steak and Eggs - Very good, quality steak, sunny side up eggs, and I tried the wonderful toast and real strawberry jam also.   Veggie Omelet - Well received.

Drinks were resonable (hell you're in Vegas)   We went back there the next morning for breakfast, even though there was a waiting time to eat, the food was not bad at all.. In fact, when you order a mimosa... You get a giant glass of mimosa!! :)  And again, the intimate atmosphere in the fireside lounge was absolutly perfect.. I mean you can actually have a real one on one date, share your favorite drink togehter, and actually tell yourself \"thank god I got away to Vegas\"  :)  I can HIGHLY recommend this place... A place to chill and relax from the craziness Vegas has to offer... Which is not a bad thing, but we all do need to recharge the batteries before going back onto the Strip!!  :)",

I had the taco omelet and hubby had the chorizo and eggs. Neither dish was anything to 'oohhhh and ahhhh' about by any means. This spot for sure won't be on our return list. Ever.",

Our plates were brought out one by one. And two of the orders we never brought out. The manager eventually came out and apologized but I will not return. The food was cold and under cooked.

    "text": "I could write a ten page diatribe on why I love this place.  I will start with a review for the lounge.  I will then proceed with a review for the restaurant.  I will then sum up my LOVE for Peppermill with a review for their \"banquet\" services - because, yes, when you get married in Vegas... you MUST have your reception at the Peppermill.  That's the only way to roll in this town.  Lounge:  seedy, swanky, and fabulous!  The service is fantastic.  I love that these are the most dressed up cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  Long sleek black gowns.  Nice touch.  The drinks are fabulous.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  At 2 am.  They are delicious, potent, and worth the money.  I love the flaming fire pit adorned with tvs.  I love the electric glow of purple and pink.  The fake foliage?  Very nice.  The chairs are comfortable (even though I have a small fear of what might be on them in the darkest corners, I take some relief in the glowing purple lights overhead... about as close to black light as we're gonna get).  Looking for a nice place to hang out with your buddies after a late night?  Or a place to get the party started at 10 pm?  Peppermill lounge is the perfect spot.  I would say the parking is super easy.  The lot behind the building is huge.  But if you're going to drink... you won't need to worry about parking.  Take a cab.  They're located at the north end of The Strip, on the immediate north side of Ross Dress For Less.  Now go.  Drink.  And Be Merry.  Restaurant:  bring an appetite.  And a tupperware container or three.  The food is fun.  There is a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The portions are MASSIVE.  You can eat until chorizo is popping out of your ears and then you'll look down and still see half of your plate full of food.  Good thing there are fridges in the rooms at the hotel!  The blueberry muffins are warm, moist, and delicious.  Don't waste your time on boring ol' toast.  Oh, you wanted the banana nut bread?  Yeah - you're going to receive and entire LOAF of banana nut bread.  Prepare to share.  My friend ordered the fruit plate with marshmallow dipping sauce.  They brought her a fruit cart (exaggerating, people... but go with it).  In all seriousness - she probably ate her 5 servings of fruit and still took home THREE containers of fruit for later.  And a 2/3 of a a banana bread.  If you're looking for a good deal in Vegas - eat here.  You'll easily get two meals out of one.  And when you're hung over and hankering for a little something when you roll in the door at 5 am - why not nosh on a little banana bread?  Banquet services:  Hubs and I had a morning wedding.  Celebrated with champagne and cupcakes immediately after (see my review for The Cupcakery in Henderson, NV).  Then we took all of our guests to lunch at The Peppermill.  We made arrangements with JoAnn a few weeks prior... selected a set menu, picked out colors and table decorations, got a map of the restaurant to make a seating arrangement... and all we had to do was show up.  It was such a blast!  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant blocked off just for us.  Cocktail waitresses took orders, waitresses took food orders, and we were good to go.  We are proud to say that our friends had never had a bacon cheeseburger at a wedding reception until they came out ours!  Chicken foccacia?  Yup.  Fruit platter.  All us.  The atmosphere was so much fun.  The tables looked fantastic.  The service was excellent.  And it was so neat to see our names on the little display board when we first arrived.  I'm not a traditional sit-down boring reception type person... so the Peppermill fit my and my husbands personality perfectly.  I think everyone had a good time and I'm forever grateful to JoAnn and the crew at The Peppermill for helping to make my special day that much more special... and unique!    If you're looking for something \"Vegasy\" to do while in Vegas, plan a trip to the Peppermill.  AND you can say you saw the table that Vince Vaughn sat at in Swingers.  How can you say not to that???",

    "text": "great great brunch/diner  what i had: - country fried steak + eggs w/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy - bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!  for two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.  pros: - food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order - service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy - location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food  cons: - decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!) - part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place  anyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots of dark purple stuff), would i go back again? YES! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?",

While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.  The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.",

    "text": "This place has been around a long time and is a must eat at when in town. This restaurant has a great lounge in it and is also a must stop. With purple and pink decor and neon lighting and couches that surround a fire pit it is a blast from the past. So very comfortable to hang out and party or have a bloddy Mary while waiting for a breakfast table. That was my strategy anyway and it works for me.   On to breakfast. I had the seafood omelet which had baby shrimp and lump crab meat in it. It was huge and very tasty. The only complaint is that it was a bit lite on the seafood and the hashbrowns that came with it. The egg to filling ratio was a bit off as a result and noticeable. There was also a variety of muffins besides the toast if you so choose. A nice option. My wife had the the taco omelet with hashbrowns. It was also very good. My daughter had the bacon and cheese omelet which she also said was very good. If it were not for the short on fillings in my omelet and the so-so service from our waitress this place would get 5 stars on this review. However this is a solid place and I will be back next time.",

Certainly not a bad breakfast option, but not worth a long walk from your hotel, either (if you are at Riviera or Circus Circus, though, check it out). Omelets are huge but filled with too much cheap American cheese, hash browns were rather hard and unappetizing. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...  I liked the blue and purple lighting and the 70's-style round booths. Waitresses wore \"Hawaiian truck stop\" floral print dresses and were exceptionally nice and attentive. Much better service than the average 24-hour hotel restaurant.  Can't comment on the dinner menu or late night experience - I'll have to go back and try it.  Overall I liked the place, and would be more likely to return soon if it weren't a little out of my way.",

    "text": "The Peppermill defies description.  Refined tackiness.  Utterly Craptastic.  Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues?  All kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.  Now to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from \"Casino\" filmed there with Sharon Stone.  The food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.  The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.  I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.  Are you noticing a trend here?  I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced.",

I had the beef dip sandwich and fries. The man had the pancake special. Holly be-jezus...the pancakes were HUGE! I do have to give a shout out to our waiter although I didn't catch his name. He was super attentive and on his A-Game. Kudos. The decor is a throwback of the 70's, which is super cheezy but like I said, good for a laugh. Would I eat here again? Maybe...especially to soak up all the liquor from the night before.",

This is the second time I have eaten at the Las Vegas Peppermill and as usual, the service, atmosphere is always fun and first rate..... however, I had breakfast of eggs and corned beef hash. The hash was canned, but very dry, as though it had been sitting under a sunlamp on a steam table that had run dry. The eggs, ordered over-easy, were burned and one yoke was almost hard boiled. The toast was very ordinary and was burned. For the price they charge (the same as the Venetian) I expect more, but Denny's a few doors away actually makes a better breakfast than this for half the price. I was very disappointed and won't be back for breakfast. Lunch will likely be fantastic, but this didn't make me happy. I think they need to look at their procedures and keep a better eye on things.",

The lounge had enough people to take up the chairs around the 1 fire pit they had but besides that, pretty much no one. The food if I may quote another yelper is like overpriced Denny's food. The service sucked in both the restaurant  and lounge. So in the restaurant they have the food runner ask your drink order but if you order alcohol then the waitress has to take that order. I guess the food runner's not allowed to serve alcohol or she just wasn't old enough to serve alcohol I'm assuming. Anyhow, that was kind of annoying. Not too mention the waitress took forever to actually come over to take that order, then forgot a drink. The lounge sucked too. Kind of dirty as in the couches you sit on and the floor. We went in and sat ourselves and waited and waited but no one asked if we wanted drinks. So I went to the bar and ordered our drinks which were kind of pricey and didn't have much alcohol in them. As I pull out my lil wad of money I could see the cocktail waitress standing to the left of the bar eyeballing and giving me a dirty look. Probably cause I went to the bar myself but hey, if you snooze you loose chick. Should have taken our order when we walked in. I gave em 2 stars cause it wasn't horrible and since it does serve food 24 hours a day. I just didn't feel it was worth my money or time. I really not sure why they have 4 stars on yelp. Maybe their breakfast is good I guess.  I more then likely won't be coming back unless I can't get any late night food somewhere else Vegas. Then maybe I'd think about it.",

The female staff here are a bunch of old Vegas retiree dancers that wear tiny jumpers and shiny tights! (bow chica wow wow!) It's also got a kind of jungle decor to it, plus all kinds of shiny mirrors and neon lights - quite tacky. The food is great with enormous servings that can easily be shared between 2 and sometimes possibly 3 people. A good variety of breakfast choices 24/7.

    "text": "This is a long overdue review since I've gone here 3 out of the 6 times I've been to Vegas in the past few years. It's a popular spot after partying for diner faire. Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from \"tradition\" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.  As for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast/muffin/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas and wanted to have a nice dinner that left our bellies happy but didn't take away from the money we were saving for our gambling addiction. Unfortunately, google led us to this sad sad establishment that looked more like a cheap brothel with its decor and bright florescent pink & blue lights. We ordered the Peppermill sampler. This name should be changed to \"The Frozen Walmart Sampler\" We've had higher quality food from CVS. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, we were presented with a bottle of pond water. And at $34 it felt equivalent to a punch in the tooth. I enjoy the taste of nose bleeds better. Our entrees were Gyros & a rack of pork ribs. When I say Gyros, I mean dried out sanitary towels that wouldn't even satisfy the drunkest person. I'd rather wither away in the Vegas dessert than eat these Gyros that were wrapped in a loaf of bread. And as for the pork ribs, I've seen more quality meat on a stray Afghan dog. The ribs were smothered in what can only be described as Goodwill's branded barbecue sauce. We took one bite of these entrees & immediately realized we had made the worst mistake either of us had made in our entire lives. My boyfriend stated that he'd rather be given a prostate exam by Captain Hook, I agreed. We were given better service from the uber driver. We were seen by so many waiters/waitresses it was enough to cause attachment issues in our personal relationships. As for the bathrooms, they were disgusting. They had has much cleanliness as a porta potty construction site after they had eaten Mexican food. I thought Jack Nicholson was going to axe down the door. The overall atmosphere was equivalent to that of Michael Jackson's funeral. The costumes that the people in the kitchen wear will fool you, they are not chefs. We still left a tip because we felt as if we were doing an act of kindness helping our poor waiter out of that place.",

It doesn't close and s sort of a Las Vegas late night staple. The service has always been prompt, both in the fireside lounge and in the diner area... but the food.. is just not that good?   I recently had a buffalo chicken wrap that was pretty much overly laden with ranch dressing and not alot of meat, or 'buffalo' style spicy sauce. My friend had a spinach and feta omelet that was not only cold, but flavorless. How that was achieved with feta in the mix, I am unsure. Overall it was unsatisfactory, but we were hungry and tired and went with it. I didn't finish my wrap, I gave it to a buddy and he complained of the excess ranch and lack of everything else as well.   $81 for 3-4 entrees, some hot coffee and tea, and alot of ranch,. I am not rushing back. The main thing I have ever ordered at the Peppermill in the past, was an Irish-Coffee with whipped cream from the bar in the Fireside Lounge. I will stick to that on any return visit from now on.",

And that didn't change much during the second visit which we had the same waitress.  But although the service is on the slow side, the food is fantastic.   We Ate there twice so far first time I had the Marco Polo Omelet and YUM is about all that needs to be said. 10 egg omelet was way more than I could eat, but every bit was delicious. My boyfriend and his brother in law had the corn beef has with the braised egg just as it was on the menu. They both said it was alright and could have been cooked just a little more to make it crispy rather than mushy, but again the portions were huge.   The second visit it was just me and my boyfriend and we got pancakes and biscuits and gravy to share. We should have just stuck with the pancakes, not that the biscuits and gravy was bad they were very good. It was just way to much. We couldn't even eat half of the pancakes as there was three of them as big as a dinner plate, and some of the best pancakes I have had.   We still have another 5 days in Vegas and we will be back again before we leave.",

Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same.   The menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much. Now, they are just about right.  The place can get crowded at times and depending on who is taking care of you, the service can be touch and go. But, this restaurant remains a must go to on the Vegas strip.

Of course we had to order a cocktail while we waited for our table!  The drinks were pretty good.  But it's the food that steals the show.  Peppermill serves SUPER LARGE portions.  I had chorizo and eggs with a pancake on the side.  The pancake takes up the entire plate.  My friend ordered nachos, nachos, nachos.  It was easily enough to feed three people!

Both are old school, classic Vegas with the restaurant featuring classic American favorites like burgers, breakfasts, sandwiches, steaks, etc. I've been here many times and most everything I've had is good. The prices are high ($20 for a Chicken Fried Steak) but portions are huge so I guess it's warranted. I'm a healthy eater but I'd easily take half a portion for half the price sometimes. This place is super popular so if you're trying to go at a peak time, either try to find a place at the counter or prepare for a pretty long wait.  The lounge is also old school with the fire pit being the main attraction. It's dark, leathery, and open 24/7. Definitely a place you want to take a date if you want an a romantic after hours dinner. Like the restaurant, prices are higher than they should be but you just can't beat the ambiance.",

    "text": "YES YES YES!  If you're in Vegas and you don't go to Peppermill, shame on you. And your momma. I am THAT serious. I was in the hunt for a brunch type restaurant that serves good bloody marys and Peppermill did not disappoint. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.  Ambience:  As other reviewers have mentioned, the pink and blue neon lights give it a divey, strip club-esque vibe which I totally loved. There's a firepit in the center of the lounge area, complete with comfy seating and overhead TVs. There are several other TVs throughout the lounge. It's quiet, yet not awkward, perfect for the invariable hangover headache. Another plus: they're open 24 hours, so you *really* have no excuse.  Staff:  The bartender was great, I wish I could remember her name. Very friendly, sincere and prompt.   Food:  The Fireside Lounge only offers food from the appetizer menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and a bloody mary (~$7). The bloody mary was definitely tasty, came garnished with a cherry tomato, a cucumber slice and a celery stick. I asked for olives and the bartender obliged. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 large jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce, and what appeared to be shredded cabbage buried beneath the cocktail sauce. While the shrimp tasted great, they were a bit chewy/tough and may have been frozen a little too long. Also, I don't know that I would pay $13 for shrimp cocktail again.  All in all, the Fireside Lounge was the start to a perfect Vegas morning (if 1:15PM counts as morning when you're hungover).",

    "text": "As a lover of the old timey time, I was a little shocked to have never heard of this little Vegas gem before! I got an invite from one of my gal pals who had come down for the Viva Las Vegas convention in Vegas. We loaded up a couple of cars and headed out to have dinner at a fancy restaurant that was seen in a couple of epic movies. I honestly was expecting an old formerly fashionable diner.   We are driving by and I am aaamazed by the fancy classic neon lights outside. We step in and I am speechless...I talk a lot so it's kinda hard for this to happen to me.    This restaurant contains all of the old classic Vegas glamour that you'd expect in the movies. It was like I had stepped into a scene of a classic movie. We put our names in for a table and we go into the bar to get drinks while our table gets set up. I was expecting, a bar with a couple of stools. To my amazement...we walked into neon dreams and magic mirrors! To top it off, there was a section in the bar with a mini pool that was on FIRE!  The servers and staff were all super friendly and amazing. We managed to order one round of drinks before our table was ready.   We get seated on a giant table and the giant menu makes it super hard to pick a meal. I went for a chicken sandwich with fries. My heart really wanted some shortcake with ice cream. It was late and I needed to eat food and dessert wasn't going to cut it.   Our food starts coming out and the portions are huuuuge! My fries were so super tasty, it's like they had some kind of magical breading on them. The chicken in my sandwich was perfectly cooked. I was able to eat half of my food and I got the rest to-go.  I was really hoping that we'd be able to come back for dinner on another day. Peppermill. we will see each other another day!",

The Scorpion was intimidating when we saw other tables drinking it but then we ended up loving it. It's dangerously tasty! Order it and share with a friend!

Saw this place as me and my bf was passing by to go pick up his friend and decided to come back to this place and eat for lunch! There was a wait list and it was cool that we got to hang out in the fireside lounge and get some drinks while waiting in a dark, mysterious lounge by a fire that was surrounded by water. In a way this diner was a bite too dark and it pretty old school retro. I mean it is a diner and at least they did something interesting about this place lol. After our wait was over we got seated, there were fake trees surrounding the booths and was not as dark as the lounge area.   Me and my bf split the Joe's San Francisco Special after asking the waitress if the food portion is share able and she said yes so we just shared it. OMG the food portion size is huge! Good thing we shared because it was also so filling that we could not even finish it.... The food itself was interesting it seems to be it could of been scrambled eggs with spinach , plus some pork sausage on the side, with hash browns, and all covered on top like a nacho cheese sauce but instead its all layered in the dish as one whole meal!  It was quite yummy! Will come back here again if I come to Vegas again!",

I've enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, drinks & appetizers in the lounge, and dinner in the lounge. It just depends on your mood. It's a kitschy vibe and reminds me of the Madonna Inn Hotel in San Luis Obispo so if you've ever been there I'd compare the two in terms of decor and vibe. The lounge is totally different - kind retro and I can't even tell you how much I love the fire/water features. I could probably hang out in there all day! I'd suggest you make a stop in there at some point on your Vegas visit!",

We got served with drinks right away, and our waitress, Angelica was a pro. She was quick and always checked on us frequently if we needed anything. Our food came out right away.

Next time I am back in city I would like to try something from the non breakfast portion of the menu rather than a bland buffet.",

We ordered to steaks and sadly they were not the best ones I've had in my life. Find even finish. The pairings were a bit off as well. I wanted mashed potatoes but the server said they were out so I decided to get fries instead. They were alright. The steak was also paired with mushrooms which were just alright nothing special. The portions are huge. I give them that. But besides that I was left sad and unsatisfied. Maybe this place is better for diner type food. If we do come next time I'll make sure to order breakfast style type of food. However as far as the steaks go I would save my money (because prices for Steaks here aren't cheap either) and go to another restaurant that has better tasking meat.  In the plus side the staff is friendly and the device is pretty quick.",

I like that the servers are dressed in long, black gowns. It feels like vintage sexiness. The entire place is vintage -from the orange upholstered banquettes to the sunken fire pit. Each booth feels private, and since this place is kind of surreal in a back-in-time way, I could imagine that a couple looking to spice things up could start a night of sexiness at this smoky-mirrored mecca. Note - this place is not for those who like new, modern, high-end things. You will not find the Peppermill sexy if you don't like a little grittiness. If you're fancy and like new, sparkly things, check out the Chandelier Lounge in the Cosmopolitan instead.",

However, if you like dining with a lamp hanging in your face, this place fits the bill. It's unfortunate, because the decor and neon lights are cool. In the end, we felt like we were in a bad episode of Charlie's Angels. The food was very sub par. I ordered the \"signature\" burger, and found it dry and flavorless. My wife's turkey burger was unseasoned, bland, and tasted like charcoal. The sweet potato fries were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a pool of grease. You can't order drinks from your server, so you have to track down the cocktail waitress. We tried the Scorpion, which supposedly had six shots. It was basically a bowl of ice and fruit juice. There was also a guy going around offering to take a complimentary picture. It reminded me of the guy who would make balloon animals at Carlos Murphy's back in the 80s. The free picture was 3x5. He was harassing a family of Scandinavian tourists trying to get them to buy an 8x10 saying that this was the best deal they would find on the Strip. Overall my stomach felt like rocks the rest of the night. Thanks Peppermill for providing memories we will never forget!",

The service is just so -so, not very friendly, but not rude either, just ok.  The portion sizes are HUGE as is the taste... the Omlets are perfectly cooked. the accompanying hash browns are delicious.. the Blueberry Muffin choice  is the way to go... they are amazing and the whipped butter that comes with is mouthwatering.  The Bacon is just the right amount of crispiness, the toast very nicely buttered.  The Waffle is outstanding, the best we've ever tasted! The Southern Fried Steak and Eggs is awesome.  Pricey but worth it and again the portion sizes are HUGE.  Will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas.",

We paid $20 to get there, because we take uber, and paid $30 for food, mind you we only got a philly and fruit. With that being said we are not in the best shape with money so having spent $50 for the worst service, was not okay. We rarely go on dates so it was really frustrating that all this happened. But even then we still paid for our meal. We get there and after waiting 15 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us, when she did all she said was \"are you guys ready to order\". I am a server and am very easy to please, because I am a server I am way more lenient about things then others. But this experience was unacceptable. After the long wait when we finally got our food *which was good* we asked for ranch and when we did she said \" I know I'm getting it \" in a very rude way and also never smiled. Then it took her about 8 minutes to get a little side of ranch. By then my boyfriend had maybe 2 bites left. The table in front of us had asked for a lemonade 5x in total and didn't even get that. They not only had to ask the busser who blew them off and continued setting up silverware but also another server who still didn't bring the lemonade by then they were extremely upset and left. so we definitely were not the only unhappy people. Very disappointed because I was so excited for this date. Will not be returning unless things change.",

Only reason they dont get 5 Star is their prices are too High. But hey it is on the las vegas strip so Wat do u expect? Complementary honey roasted peanuts in lounge is a plus. But heres my biggest tip. FRENCH TOAST AMBROSIA. sooooo gooood. Love the purple boisenberry (I think) syrup. Loaded with fruit. Orgasm in my mouth. Probably best french toast dish ive ever had. Layout of this restraunts pretty dope as well. Looks like whoever designed it was on shrooms. Lol. Cool place.",

    "text": "Spunky, surreal neon decor with leggy waitresses wearing shiny hose. Famous amongst locals and was in the movie Swingers I hear. Right next to the Riviera down a ways on the strip. Service was good and the food quite tasty. Lots of variety. I was in Vegas on business and ate there twice. The ribeye was quite good and they didn't overcook it which, to me at least, is vital. The next time I got the gyro which was tasty but the lamb was just OK. No one was displeased with their meal as far I remember. If you're cruising through Vegas and want to try something very authentically \"Vegas\" but also desire a good meal and don't want to break the bank, Peppermill's the spot.  Open 24 hours by the way and oh yeah, if you're a drunkard this place is also optimal as they have a fireside lounge which seems to cater to the party crowd.",

Every few years I go back hoping for a change but always get kicked in the ass. The butter isn't real, the milk is room temp, the bread Walmart, the tea not hot, the silverware not clean.  I made the mistake of getting an Italian dish once...omg the worst.  The service was fine and again I love the atmosphere, visible kitchen & location.  I hope for change in food!",

He named a few places and then I asked, \"where would you go?\" He said to the Peppermill and I've been sold every since.   The service has always been nice, quick and courteous.   I can't suggest too much from the menu because I'm always ordering the steak and egg breakfast. Very good for the price. I would highly recommend this place.",

The fake trees and flowers and colorful lights are a bit cheesy, but I really like it! Makes for beautiful pictures! There's also a guy coming around to the tables taking pictures trying to get you to buy them. They're super cute, but does anyone actually buy those?!  The portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE. The two of us couldn't finish an omlette, a bowl of clam chowder, and a milkshake! Hell, we only finished half of it! We're big eaters too x_x I don' remember which omlette we ordered, but it had a lot of meat and it was okay at first but pretty sickening after a while. The vanilla shake was good. It's the thick kind, which usually isn't my thing. Clam chowder was way too salty and just not good. I think a can of Campbell's Chunky clam chowder is 100x better!   I think the Peppermill would be a perfect late night filler, but I don't think I'd come here again unless I was seeking out drunk food.",

I think they use a whole carton of eggs for an omelette, not kidding. There is a seperate bar (to the left of entry)that is quite unique..it has a circular sunken area that faces a crystal fire pit. There are also several tvs ,in case you dont find the array of characters (fellow patrons)entertaining. Their cocktail menu (extensive-frozen drinks,etc)& bar food menu is pretty good,  something for everyone, as well as virgin cocktails too.. This is a place to people watch as it is open 24 hours & anyone who knows Vegas, knows the Peppermill. Very good diner food for all ages.  Depending on time of day or night, there may be entertaining drunken party stragglers trying to sober up with a meal. It is a good size restaurant however, maintaining order & comfort for their patrons. Spend the extra $ & skip IHop & come here. You wont be disappointed.",

First of all the portions they give you for the price is huge!! The sandwhich was 2 layers with mustard and mayo on rye bread that didnt interfere with the taste of the delicious pastrami at all.  The fries were also good, crispy and hot.      Employees were very attentive and overall the customer service was great.  Definitely got my money's worth from this place.",

It is always a smile floating past you as you enjoy the atmosphere. Depending on how much you had to drink will determine how good the food taste.

    "text": "A True Las Vegas classic and it took me about ten trips to Sin City to check this one off my list. Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.  The atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.  We stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.  It's a timeless classic in a town that insists on constantly reinventing itself. Just go. It probably won't change or close anytime soon, but don't take any chances!",

We were headed to the Cowboy Christmas at the Convention Center, but ended up enjoy ourselves more at breakfast with your entire restaurant standing room only all the way outside to Las Vegas Boulevard. You must have been the most popular restaurant in town today. Thanksgiving Weekend, we enjoyed dinner with waffles for my son, but today we joined the riders and ranchers headed to Cowboy Christmas for the special Steak and Eggs you were serving with fresh, baked blueberry muffins.

It does not live up to its hype and really didn't look to have much to offer as I looked at people's plates on the walks in and out.

    "text": "Loved it! Actually we loved it so much, we ate there 3 times over the week we were in Vegas. Very reminiscent of the \"old Las Vegas\" and almost nostalgic. Truly a visual spectacle! The only thing better than the food was the appearance of the restaurant.  The decor is some of the most interesting I've seen with exotic plant life all around you and neon running the walls and ceilings. The lounge was fantastic and very upscale looking with the round oversized cushions and tables. 21 and over in there, so that portion of the restaurant is not for kids.  Food portions are huge! Each time my girlfriend and I took leftovers back to the hotel. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day everyday. We didn't wait long at all for food or drink! Service was exceptional each time regardless of when we went. A huge perk in itself!  Convenient and easy to get to with a large side lot and front lot. Parking is not an issue. So be sure to swing by and give the Peppermill a try! You won't be disappointed, just be sure to bring your appetite!!",

    "text": "SERVER:  Our waitress CJ was THE BEST and made ALL the difference in our experience here!!  She is very knowledgeable of the food they serve & was spot on with her suggestions. Although she was busy, she was very warm, friendly and attentive.  FOOD:  Eggs Benedict (as CJ said) was yummy!    I ordered the Western fruit plate / platter that usually comes with banana bread & marshmallow cream sauce which 1) I did not want and 2) they did not have, so CJ asked if I wanted a muffin or something in lieu. Of my choices, I  chose the lemon muffin which CJ said was really good and it REALLY was! Loved it!  The only thing....CJ could have warned me of the large amount of fruit that I had unknowingly ordered. Yikes! But so yummy!  ESTABLISHMENT:  Came across Peppermill via Yelp, and its old school Vegas charm & good reviews made us pick it as our late breakfast / lunch destination.  Haven't been to Vegas for nearly 9 years now, I  initially thought the low ceilings, neon lights & crowd made this to be a wrong choice on our part.  Even at 2 in the afternoon, it was crowded with a steady stream of people.  We were greeted right away, the gal took our name, told us it was about a 20 minute wait and said we could wait in the bar if we'd like.   The bar is to the left, separated from the dining area itself.  Thank goodness cuz it was a bit too smokey for our taste.  Cool bar area though!  Just a little to early in the day for us for that atmosphere.  (Yes, we're a little older in age.  Oh and I'm a former smoker.)  We waited in the entry area instead which is kinda small, with slot machines on one wall & a big support beam towards another wall.  We waited about 10-15 minutes before being called for our table. Because the hostess called two parties & we both approached the hostess desk, there was a little confusion about who she was taking to be seated.  There was a gal walking around offering to take a \"complimentary\" picture of us, but we declined.  She was nice, not pushy, but....no thanks.  There was a gal dressed in a long black dress (wait staff, hostess, cashier had uniforms), asking us for any drink orders.  Nice & attentive, remembered to check on us.  SUMMARY:  Cool place to check out. Our waitress made our experience exponentially better.  Other staff was nice.  Food was yummy.    Would we go back again? Probably not.  But this review comes from a near 50, partied hard in my younger days but now I'm more into the wine & chill scene, kind of person.    Would we suggest people go check it out at least once? Definitely....and ask to sit in CJ's section.  ;-)",

    "text": "That was the worst hashbrowns I've ever had. I didn't know that they could be messed up that bad. The oil used tasted like engine oil. Okay, I am maybe exaggerating a little bit but it tasted like very cheap low quality cooking oil and it made the whole thing disgusting. Not to mention that it was way too salty on one end and totally tasteless on the other end as well. The Lorraine omelette was edible. But my friend's BLT had mushy bacon and the French fries were terrible as well. They looked very shiny, in a strange way, but not as if they were excessively greasy and tasted terrible. They are probably using the same nasty oil to cook their fries in.  I mean, it was past midnight and I was starving and I only ate half a fry. I texted my friend whom I know loves this place and he said what he loves about it is the ambience but the food is really terrible. I couldn't agree more. If you look at the price of their steaks, they are comparable to Herbs and Rye. Seriously?",

The helping is massive and two people can call it a meal.   On one occasion, after a bit much to drink, I ordered a chicken fried steak and nachos!  No way! Yes way! Of course it was about 2am and I don't remember what happened after that....   I am not a fan of the back parking lot. Creepy. So hope for a spot in the front.  There is one of those indoor skydiving places within walking distance, but I don't suggest drinking-the nachos and then indoor skydiving.",

Fortunately, I have none.    Also, she offered to box up our food... but didn't give us one of our leftover meals.

It was supposed to come with three sandwich things or whatever you call them and I only got 2 with an extra yolk on top. I asked to substitute hash browns with a bagel because I don't eat potatoes and she said no and said I could get a side bagel and she charged me $5 for it. Although expensive the only thing I actually enjoyed for the whole meal was the bagel. My parents didn't enjoy their food (Joe's SF breakfast and Country fried steak) and my brother said his was okay (turkey burger). Our waitress (Angelica or Angelina or something like that) was rude and never smiled but smiled at the guys at the bar while flirting. My mom told the manager and she said oh I'm sorry about that and didn't even discount anything of the $80 bill. We've eaten better at a buffet dinner for only $65! Overall it was the worst meal I've had here in Vegas and although the restaurant itself was pretty, I'll never go there again. Don't waste your money here when there's so many better places.",

I ordered the Munches Breakfast and it was perfect. My aunt and fiancee had the Peppermill Pancake and OMG it was awesome! They had pork sausages and bacon that I wish I can make at home. My grandma had the Denver Omelette, of course just a regular omelette, no biggie but everything else was great! HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS SPOT! Oh and can't forget our amazing waitress, Virginia. Very sweet and on top of her service! She deserves a raise!",

    "text": "If you've never been here, it is seriously a must! Super old school Vegas feel with lots of glass/crystal, velvet booths, actual cocktail waitresses, and plenty of neon lights. This place has quite the reputation, not to mention is super popular, so if you're planning a visit be sure to make a reservation. Even if you don't think you'll need one, you're going to need one. Wait times range from a half hour to multiple hours (during peak times).   When you first walk in, you're greeted by slot machines, dimmed lights, and plenty of neon and rich purple. Hopefully you've made a reservation so you can inform the hostess that your party as arrived (and not that you're here to simply wait an hour for a table, because that is simply torture). She'll escort you to a plush booth where you'll take a seat and she'll let you know your server and cocktail waitress will arrive shortly. The cocktail waitress will arrive first and ask for you drink orders. Customary to Vegas, they have a huge selection of very large, very obnoxious alcoholic beverages. They do have a full bar as well if that isn't really your style. Did I mention she'll likely be dressed in old school Vegas glam? Next, your server arrives and asks for your order. This might take a minute because their menu is HUGE with so much variety. After changing your mind, four times, five time, six times okay closing the menu now... you'll tell the waitress your selection!     The food is then quick to arrive and you will be blown away by the taste and not to mention the large portion sizes. You'll try to devour it all because it's so good, but that won't be possible. Fortunately the server will offer you a box so you can enjoy this the next day too. You'll then HAVE to make room for dessert because they have an overwhelming huge (and yummy) brownie sundae that is larger than your head. Again you'll try to devour it all, but it simply won't happen. You'll then roll out of the restaurant completely satisfied with your decision to visit!",

Or sit in the main area and have a full meal.  I can get Oatmeal with fruit and brown sugar 24 hours a day.  I really like Breakfast around midnight.  My friends were happy with the regular food items though it can feel a little pricey for the food and drinks.  Give yourself time.  The wait staff is somewhat slow and they are always packed.  We met up with friends to eat something before their flight and it took almost an hour to get food.",

    "text": "Let's discuss the Peppermill Restaurant side first, because I feel like you have two totally different experiences in the same business depending on whether you are headed to the restaurant or the lounge.  The Peppermill Restaurant--So, the decor is a little tacky---what isn't tacky about Las Vegas though???  Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.  The food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.  However--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!    Yvette L. Brownstone from Ventura, CA",

So I try to search for places that have been around for a while to get the same feel of what it was back then. They are there but you got to look hard to find them.   The Peppermill is one of them...Great ambiance, good food, ample portions and very comfortable. The decor is flashy Vegas but really Kool.  If you are tired of the same old thing and eating at soulless hotel restaurants, coffee shops, Mickey d's and the like.....go here. It's fun, different and the food is good. And...Don't forget to visit the lounge!!",

My bf said he's been coming to this place for years so I guess for those that know about it, it's a legend.   Why would anyone bother going to Denny's when you can go to the Peppermill?!  Food was super fresh, I had a veggie omelette that was gigantic and perfectly fluffy. It seriously had to have been made with at least four or five eggs. Sadly I couldn't finish it, especially since it also came with toast and I got fruit instead of potatoes. Mind you, this was good fruit, not just some grapes and a slice of melon. It was more like a mini fruit salad along with all the other food!   I must say, I have a special place in my heart for the kind of gaudy decor (fake plants and pink flamingo lamps) that awaits you at The Peppermill. The waitresses all wear cute little outfits and are super friendly, seemed like they've probably worked here since it opened. Apparently there's also a nice fire pit in the other room, which I didn't get a chance to see. It's open 24-hours too so, of course, I am a fan. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town and I'd love to see what they have for dinner...",

    "text": "I went to the Peppermill on 4/4. I got married in Vegas on 4/6. My husband and I have always made a special trip to the Peppermill every time we're in Vegas, so naturally, we picked it as the location for our rehearsal dinner. I called to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance. I even wrote to them on their site to ask about the availability of a vegan meal for one of my guests. I never got an email or call back, by the way.   When I called to make the reservation for 6 people, I confirmed with the manager about a vegan meal. I called back a week later to add 2 more people to my reservation, and change my time to 6PM. So it was confirmed, TWICE. When we got to the Peppermill, they had no reservations for us. The hostess said we would have to wait with everyone else and made no apologies for the mistake. She even said they do not accept reservations, even though it says they do on their site and I called and did so! I asked to speak with a manager. The manager had no explanation and was actually rude about it. Our party had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, which defeated the purpose of me making reservations in the first place. Then, once we ordered, my meal and my husband's meal was served 20 minutes after everyone else in my party's meal.   This was the worst experience I have ever had at the Peppermill. My reception dinner was ruined. I was so embarrassed by the poor service and the rudeness of the hostess and manager, especially after we told everyone what a great place this was. I can't see myself dining there again. I was so disappointed. I had other out-of-town wedding guests who asked about dining there. I warned them that the service isn't what it used to be.   Peppermill, if you're reading this, please make your staff aware that in this economy, this is the best way to lose loyal customers, rudeness and poor service.",

We didn't finish it because it was so much and had forgotten all about our individual entree. I ordered the Pesto Chicken sandwich. When I saw it I was full just by looking at it but of course I ate as much as I could and it tasted delicious. The service and vibe are great and everyone that eats there is friendly and fun.   After dinner we went to check out the Fireside Lounge on the other side, my friend calls it the Swingers Lounge because it reminds you of something from the 70's with the dim lights, more neon lights and fire place. Different for sure.  Make sure to stop by on your next Las Vegas visit.",

Nice decor, reminds me of the cheesy touristy Vegas I grew up visiting, in a good way.",

It was almost noon, but the place was packed with people, some of whom were drinking enormous cocktails. The cocktail waitress was scantily clad, and there was another woman with few clothes on offering to take pictures of couples and groups sitting at their banquettes.   The service was fine. I had a \"Cobb Salad,\" which was more like a chef's salad (no egg, no bleu cheese, but both turkey AND ham), but which was so large it came in something resembling a porcelain horse trough. I could only finish half of it and I felt bad about the waste of food. Total cost for my lunch, including my diet coke, was around $20. While this is more than I like to pay for lunch, I feel like I got my money's worth, between the dark-and-neon decor and the people-watching. If you are going to Las Vegas, go there once.",

I have never been to one but I bet even the laundromats in vegas make you stoked to put your quarters in the slot, cuz you just might win!  Win getting your clothes clean that is!  Anyways, back to the peppermill.  This place was so awesome.  Neon, glamorous, chromey interior. Just the thing you need after you've been at a gentlemen's club till 7am that same morning.   So you hit the Peppermill.  It's nice and cool, and darkly lit, and the waitresses are really chill.  They serve HUGE bloody marys and mimosas.  (The bloodies need more horseradish though.)     Food portions are huge and the menu is extensive.  You will definitely find something to eat here.    there is even a lounge in the back with a cool fire pit you can sit by if you want even more of the hair of the dog.     This is a great place to go to re-calorize for your flight home.   A fitting end to a great vegas weekend!",

I had the NY steak and eggs so the portions that everyone was talking about didn't correlate with my meal since my steak is weighed.  Though, the hash browns seam a bit stingy now that I think about it.  My wife ordered a San Fran scramble.  That portion was big.  We took it home in box.  Our waitress was fast to take our order and serve us.  She asked if I needed a coffee refill and said it would be refilled.  I did't know this was done by someone else as I finished my meal to stop the young man, who also sat us, to refill me.  I was irritated by not having my coffee refilled during my meal.  A lady gave us a complimentary photo.  Another lady came by and asked if we wanted cocktails.  So, two things are preventing me from giving this place 4 stars which are:  small portion of hash browns and the wait for a coffee refill.",

They make great Omelets, and awesome Bloody Mary's for those early breakfasts when you're not quite done partying. The place is done in purple neon, like it's 1970, but it's not run down--just stuck in time.  It's clean, the food is fresh, and the portions are huge.

Green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town).",

Wait staff varies. I have been to this place many time spanning 2 decades. I love the joint but the waitresses are hit and miss. Often a miss. My recent visit she was pretty slow both speed and on the uptake. Bartender is good though and again, the place is just cool to visit.   Restaurant side is also a visual splendor. Food is \"OK\". Edible but you are not going to leave saying \"wow great food\". Unless all you care about is portion which 90% of the tourists seem to fall into (large eating large).   I would tell anyone to visit both restaurant and lounge side for an experience the rest of Vegas has lost. Great date spot.  For movie buffs the scene in Casino were Sam and Ginger are sitting having a drink and she returns to be asked \"any change\" ... that's the Peppermill lounge.",

The place looks like it has been untouched with the exception of an interesting set of flat panel screen TVs by the lobby entrance.  Other than that, even the waiter and waitresses all stress fairly different than a typical diner, which gives this place a unique vibe.   We were sat immediately on a Monday afternoon, but it took a little longer than it should have for our server to come (and mind you, I was slightly hung over and needed a big greasy meal in my belly).   Our server came (prompt thereafter), but wasn't overly friendly or anything. Just did his job and took care of us with no issues. I ordered a scramble which was huge.... really, EVERYTHING you order here can be easily split with another person. But, it was nice to take it back to the hotel to eat for dinner.   The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but I think the overall vibe of this place, along with the large portions is why this place is so highly regarded. Oh, and not to mention all of the movies that have scenes inside this restaurant over the years is probably another reason.   Would I come back here if in Vegas again? Ehhh, most likely not, but I don't have anything really bad to say about it. It's location is certainly not in the most convenient spot if you are staying and walking around the strip. It's just too far north of all the action so taking a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or driving yourself would be the most convenient option. I would imagine once they complete the new Asian-style themed hotel/casino across the street in a few years that this place will be even more busy.  Not a bad choice to eat!",

They're one of the oldest restaurants in vegas which is so cool! Open 24 hours, it kind of gives me a strip club vibe not going to lie but very worth checking out and dining!   We came at around 3AM on Saint Patrick day after going to downtown fremont and let me tell you it was packed! There was a gigantic parking lot but it does still get packed. I was so amazed because i have never been here before and there was so many people early in the morning! Everyone was drunk so the customers were all so happy and the crazy thing was we waited for only 5 minutes and got called to sit at a table so they clean up super fast! When we sat down we looked through the menu and ordered. Our server was so nice and the food came out pretty fast too but let me tell you.. the portion is HUGE like the \"appetizers\" might as well be the entree.   There was a lot of cocktail drinks and someone comes to each table and asks for your order but unfortunately we were drunk enough after fremont so we opted out. I loved this whole set up environment it felt so cozy and a good change of scenery from modern dining. There's also a 3 color SUGAR sprinkle on the table, don't think it was salt like me!  What we ordered:   Mushroom Swiss Burger: The burger itself was so juicy but my complaint is that it was so soggy on the bottom so the burger was falling apart so for the first time ever i didn't finish my burger!! it was a deal breaker. But i have a love for onion rings and there's is soooo crunchy and battered perfectly they give you a big portion and the option to choose what side you wanted as well! (Medium rare cooked)   Nachos Nachos Nachos: This thing is HUGE it should be illegal to say this is a appetizer. It comes out in 2 dishes and it was so cheesy. It was 3 colored chips with 2 meats and tomatoes and olives etc  I think this place deserves to be called a Las Vegas gem i'm so happy historic places like this still exists and locals should support businesses like this one to be around for a long time. In a city filled with modernization and constant new buildings and casino being built it's good we still have this oldie.",

Had a great mimosa as well - they offer them in 3 flavors.   We each ordered a breakfast plate, and all had at least half of a plate left. The omelets had at least 6 eggs in each and we're very fluffy. It's a lot of food, so be prepared to feast or share!",

Ended up sending it back with no fuss from the owners. The other dishes were decent but not something to order on a regular. More than likely I'll stick with the drinks and appetizers from now on.",

Plush, colorful booths, fire pits surrounded by water, stained glass light shades with pink flamingos. It's the 70's all over again! Open 24 hours a day, you can get your fix of all things old Vegas and delicious whenever you desire.  The drinks are pretty weak but the food is fantastic. There's a lot to offer on the menu. Definitely enough to accommodate whoever walks in the door. I am particularly fond of their breakfast food. My favorite, their hashbrowns. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.   Coffee's always hot and fresh. Wait staff are always on top of it. You'll never sit without a refill or with any dirty plates in your way. Be prepared to wait for a table. Anytime I have come in, I've waiting at least 20 minutes. This past weekend it was an hour. I would wait it out, it's worth it.",

The mozzarella sticks were really good and seemed battered rather than breaded which I loved.   The blueberry muffin came out warm and was delicious. It was like eating a small cake   The garden omelet was HUGE but really delicious. And they remembered to leave out the tomatoes when I asked.   The \"side\" pancake was larger than my head. I couldn't believe it when they brought it out. But it was good and very fluffy.   The gumbo soup was delicious although a bit thinner than I expected.   My boyfriend loved his steak and the Alfredo was good but not amazing.   Overall our experience was fantastic. Our server was amazing and kept our drinks full and made sure we were taken care. I would definitely come here again.",

The ambiance is very intimately-casual? it's cool to have TREES and lights while dining - there are even complimentary photos! (not sure if this is a daily thing or just on Friday when we went at like 3am)  I got the Peppermill Pastrami Burger and wow. Fresh, cooked well, and they had onion rings as a side option at no extra charge! Onion rings are my favorite kind of rings. They were crunchy and the onion did not slide out when you take a bite. That's a sign of a good ring! The burger was tasty and not overly salty. Pastrami tends to be salty and I was afraid it would be too much, but it was seasoned well and really good. Would eat again!  My partner got the french dip and I only to try one bite because he devoured it. Very flavorful au jus and if my love for onion rings wasn't so strong - I would get the potato salad. Flavorful and fresh tasting. It wasn't heavy like some potato salad can be. It was a cool contrast to the hot sandwich.   Overall, great dining experience and will be here time and time again for late night eats. But might share a plate next time - the portions are very generous. They also have a cool lounge attached to the restaurant. Poked my head in and it looked like a chill place to hang out.",

Glad we got on the list, because they were citing a 45-minute wait to walk-ins when we arrived!  The place was packed, and the vibe was loud but weirdly intimate in our booth. Perfect for a family trying to squeeze in a late dinner: our three boys under 5 years old were starting to meltdown a bit, but nobody noticed in this environment. Totally welcoming for groups of all sizes. Love that the servers didn't give us strange looks for coming in with a stroller. The prices were reasonable and the portions were big.

I've never been lucky enough to go to The Peppermill for dinner. By nightfall I'm usually off drinking too much rum and losing $. Dancing until my shoes are in my purse and a bouncer is yelling at me to put them back on. Fuck that guy! Well, The Peppermill is always there to save me the next day. I'm super hungover, sad to see daylight, sunglasses lightly placed on my sad nogin. My temples have a heartbeat.  \"Table for six\" \"Name?\" \"Idiot\" \"It'll be a 30 minute wait, ok?\" Now this is not a sad story. All down trodden hungover, breakfast seekers can wait in the fireside lounge! You have to see the place to believe it. They should charge admission. A giant circular fireplace that's always on, even when it's 110 degrees outside. They have bright pink couches, blue super squishy carpet and enough mirrors to satisfy the Kardashians, all back lit by subtle neon. The place has some ambiance, ok?  Through a sea of faux cherry blossoms, the heroic cocktail server is there to save the day. YES! Lovely ladies in evening gowns serving cocktails at 11:00am on Sunday without judgment. I love drinking in the lounge while I wait for an amazing breakfast! \"Idiot, party of 6!\" \"Yay, that's me!\" The menu is huge as are the portions. Be prepared to want a nap when you're done! I always get the steak and eggs. My husband gets the corned-beef hash with extra hash browns. I seriously dream about their hash browns!  All in all this place is awesome. Great service, food, drinks, at a reasonable price and a Vegas atmosphere that you won't find anywhere else on The Strip.",

I ate my biscuits first while they were walking around asking if it was ok and yes at the time it was good but by the time i ate my ribs they were gross and told them i was not satisfied with just the ribs the manager came and told me i didn't say anything before when they walked by and told him because i hadn't tried them so i didn't no they were Going to taste gross and all he said was he couldnt do anything about it but give me more bbq sauce now why would i want more sauce for when the ribs are dry. So all i have to say is make sure you try  all your food before because the manager doesn't care.",

They have full bar service 24 hours a day as well with cocktail waitress service. You can get breakfast, lunch, or even just drinks.

Featured everywhere inside are bright pink and purple lighting and neon.  In the restaurant, there are many circular booths with plastic trees everywhere.  In the bar, there is a sunk-in fire pit and totally groovy lounge furniture.  The drinks are decent and so is the food.  The menu is typical of what you would find in a diner where you can order anything at any time.  I have had burgers, breakfast for dinner, steaks, club sandwiches, big salads and more on visits over the years.  I had probably been to Peppermill 10 or 12 times before I became a Yelper.  I have not been back for several years ... since the Riviera was torn down.  The Peppermill is a classic.  I heard Frank even ate here!  I have seen the restaurant on a CSI episode.  If you want a break from the casinos, and a diner meal in a kitschy-cool place, ... The Peppermill is waiting for you.",

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says \"some things are better left unchanged\" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.  The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the \"big guys\" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.  If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.  Note: The company that owns Peppermill also has a Peppermill Casino in Reno, Western Village Casino in Sparks, and operates a small Casino called Rainbow Club in Henderson.",

Minus the cocktail servers, they weren't really paying attention and took awhile to serve us. Not only that but there alcoholic drink menu doesn't name any prices  whatsoever. But other than that over all the food/service/atmosphere was so great and the decorations were spectacular! Definitely would recommend! The pricing was completely fair and completely worth every penny. I had the Rueben sandwich (absolutely delicious) and my mans had the New York steak and said \"it was fire\" so I'm taking that as a win!",

From reviewing the menu, everything is premium priced.    I asked for sunny side up eggs.  The first time, they came cold.   Cold.  The second time, not really completely done.  I think for almost 16 bucks you would get that right.    The breakfast sausage, I'll admit, was larger than normal.  And they do include 3 eggs instead of the normal two you would find in most french toast combos.  I think you are paying for the atmosphere which is very vegas like with interesting colors.  Or maybe this is a memory thing for older Vegas regulars.  They went there once and had a good time and now revisit because they want to relive that moment.  Service was okay, but no one refilled my drinks.  I'm glad I tried it out, but probably won't be back.",

The atmosphere is electric and the service was excellent. My BLT was okay. Unfortunately, the white bread was average, the bacon was too much for my taste, but the avocado added an unusual touch. The fries were nice & crispy. Both the wine & sandwich were a little pricey. It is definitely worth a visit for the decor itself and having its own free parking lot on the Strip is a plus.",

Told it would be a 40 minute wait, but these pros had us in a huge booth within 20 minutes where we enjoyed some incredible, huge portion grub at an oh-so fair price. Fish and Chips and Eggs Benedict (three eggs! but still two muffins) are major go's. But honestly I was totally cool with the wait and almost went for a total liquid Christmas dinner, because the crown jewel, Fireside Lounge, is the most glorious \"waiting room\" you can imagine. Arguably more famous than the diner, the place is literally straight out of the 70s, and the movies (Casino with Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone anyone???). And can I give a shout out to the incredible bartender? She was slinging cocktails for the bar AND restaurant....one awesome lady. When we came back after dinner for a nightcap, she even remembered our somewhat specific drinks order, even though she had probably made hundreds of drinks in between.  Uber trip from City Center was about 10 minutes, $12. Totally worth getting out of your hotel megaplex hell and out to Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge.",

    "text": "Menu is extensive, food portions are definitely large, and the place is a legitimate LV Strip 'landmark' -- being around for a relatively long time, in a city that's constantly destroying 'dated' places & replacing them with the latest architecture & trends.  Can be great people-watching too. From the 'down & out' that are loitering in the parking lot, thinking about breaking-in to your car or that'll stop you by the entrance & give you the scam story about how they're a fellow-tourist whose wallet got stolen & need $10 gas money so they can drive back home to California, to the various hotel/casino/show employees killing time before or after work, the hipsters trying to look cool, and the tourists who are happy to finally be in the famous Peppermill, in the famous Las Vegas & either willing to show it, or are trying to suppress it & look cool.  Unfortunately, the couple times I've been there, the food just hasn't been all that great.  Part of that is probably because I'm sober with fully-functioning tastebuds, part of that is perhaps because I'm a vegetarian, and despite the eclectic menu, there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, let-alone ones that appeal to me.    So as a 'local' that's been there numerous times, I either try to steer touristy friends away from it, or if I go there with them, I make sure I'm not hungry, and that they don't have high expectations.   But if you're a tourist who is spending 5 days in Vegas, or has been to Vegas many times in the past, by all means, stop by Peppermill for breakfast or lunch & get a feel for it yourself -- it *is* a landmark, and their lounge sound like a fun place to have a drink or two.  But of you're on your first(or second, or third...) visit & your time here is precious, I wouldn't make the Peppermill a priority.",

Located down the strip almost across from Circus Circus, it is a little nostalgic gem among all the grand new hotels and restaurants.  From start to finish this place did not disappoint.  The inside was eclectic bordering between 60's and 80's vibes; fully of cool neon with a diner type feel.  The menu was massive, and so are the portions.  We had the shrimp cocktail to start which was delish, with five jumbo shrimp I should have just had a salad after to save room for dessert.  But I didn't.  My husband ordered the NY strip, I had chicken.  Both meals come with salad and the portions were so huge we should have just split a meal .  The food was really really great, my chicken was tender and the sauce flavorful.  Mashed potatoes were *real* and not sure why since they were just mashed potatoes but SO good.  The drink menu has some interesting and fun cocktails, we ordered a Scorpion which was 2 person cocktail (although I drank 3/4 myself) and it was wonderful.  Service throughout was on point.  There are some slot machines in the little lobby area, my husband ended up winning 200 bucks on a nickel machine while we were waiting on an Uber.  I am coming back here, and have probably already told 20 people to go here.  I truly hope this strip gem sticks around another 40 years!",

They have a small bar menu, but you have be seated in the restaurant to get the full menu. My friend I sat in the restaurant and the service was really good. They asked about drinks right away- we were consistently checked on and the manger stopped by to asked how we enjoyed our meal and gave a us a little history on the place. I had the French Toast collage and I don't eat eggs but they let me substitute with hash browns. The French Toast was really good- fluffy and sweet. I also liked the flavor of their sausage, but they were a little dry. I'm local so wouldn't make this place regular, but it was an overall great experience.",

It tasted good but serving sizes were just too big. I got eggs benny but I only needed two eggs. I got 3 and a serving of cottage cheese so big that when I ate my fill it looked like I had not touched it.  We got there during happy hour. Drink service was quick but my mojito was way too sweet so I did not finish it. My hubby loved his wine and sampler tray. His leftovers made great midnight snacks",

I was there during the week or breakfast so it wasn't too busy but I heard it can get busy there.  The Lounge is to the left and the restaurant is to the right. It's a diner, Vegas style is my best way to describe. I didn't go into the lounge but I did notice a bar right inside. Of course there are the slot machines by the door as everywhere in Vegas.  The restaurant is great. All the seating is booths or counter tops. Classic diner style. The counter you can see the food be prepared and can you track your food as it comes out. Breakfast was great. Portions were huge. I didn't quite finish my meal.  Service was great too. Just enough attention.  There are TV's hanging throughout the restaurant portion as well.  They are open 24 hours and the menu is diner options, breakfast, sandwiches, hot entrees, etc. I only had the breakfast but I'm sure the food in general is pretty good here.",

You will get vaguely normal folk from the strip who have heard of the legend that is the Peppermill mixed in with crazy folk who have been there all night playing the video poker machines and rumour has it the odd lady of the night with that something extra that you really do not want to see!

She only came to our table to get our order after 15 minutes of us waiting and she came after she heard us talking about her! THREE different people took mimosa drink orders and the drinks did not came until we go our meals! Finally we had a new waitress who was much better! I had the chicken wrap which I did not like and it did not come with the sauce! The chicken wings were too salty.  My friends got the pancakes and omelet.

We had a large group, about 10, and it took a really long time to seat us, even though we seemed to be the only people waiting in the front. They finally sat us down with attitude after about 20 minutes when we complained. Then we were served by the most sassy waitress I've ever had, whose idea of asking for orders was, \"What you want?!\" After waiting for our food for a good bit we were all served our breakfast...cold. The Munch's Breakfast I ordered was literally thrown down on the table in front of me and was abysmal. The eggs tasted powdered or like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced. My advice to someone looking for some good breakfast: go anywhere else. Hell, drive out to Primm and eat at a gas station- it'll be half the price and just as good.",

First off the hostess and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  Our waitress answered all our questions about drinks and when one of the couples with us ordered the large nachos she recommended the small and boy am I glad she did because the small could easily feed 4-6.  The drinks were well priced and made well.  I opted for the Bloody Mary while the BF got The Scorpion (as seen on TV) - both were mighty tasty.  Our group not only had the nachos but also the BBQ sliders, ribs and the app sampler.  All were made really quick and tasted good.  There was even a photographer who came around and took group pics of us (free of charge).  We showed up around 4pm on a Friday and though the fireside table was reserved at 7pm the waitress politely notified us but didn't pressure us to leave or even move (which we did when more of our party showed up around 6:30pm).  All in all I give this place 5 stars and will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!",

You enter the super dark lounge through glass doors and there is a walk down roundabout with a pool (cool water which I tested) and a mini volcano erupting in the center, televisions all around everywhere but then again the ceilings are covered in disco ball mirror tiles and the walls alllll mirrors so maybe there was only one tv but the reflection in the mirrorS made me see otherwise...  anyway it was very calming after a rough night with the bright pink, blue and tiny lil white lights.  I honestly could have taken a nap here and nobody would have seen me.  There are all these small rooms tucked away amidst the mirrors, red carpet and red couches.  $8.00 Bloody marys which are served in a large cocktail glass along with a HUGE piece of celery, tomato and a slice of cucumber are a meal in themselves make it a double for and extra $2.00.    Its a good time, make sure to stop by next time youre dragging on a morning in Vegas.",

The drinks were always decent, with a good pour of liquor, not the light handed stuff you get at the hotel bars.  Service was always prompt and friendly.",

    "text": "So...came to this joint per recommendation of Holly Madison's Twitter feed...Unfortunately she wasn't there the time I showed up. Ha! BUT I have to say I was really surprised by this place. Such a funky, cool Vegas spot. Yes all the other reviews are right. Very Kitsch and lots of neon and mirrors and the fireplace in the middle of the restaurant is pretty cool. TIP: when you walk in you have to go to the bar/lounge area to the left for this stuff. There is a main eating room/diner area to the right when you walk in. GO LEFT to the lounge. You can still get great diner food and big drinks in there.  I did feel like the place could have been a strip club at some point. I kept looking to see if there was some remnant of a stripper pole in there somewhere but couldn't find it. Never researched the history on this joint so who knows? Anyway, I love finding weird fun and funky spots outside of \"The Strip\" and this one definitely one to visit.",

    "text": "This was a bright spot in the culinary adventures of Vegas.  We went for a early dinner before heading to the airport and it was lovely.  The restaurant is clean and have awesome decor---I felt like I was in Vegas eating somewhere that I should see people or that it should be 4am and I should be getting a huge breakfast after a night out at the clubs.  The restaurant had a couple of others in it (we're talking dinner at 3:45 so its even early for the early birds) but they sat everyone in places where you didn't feel like you were on top of the others.  Service was prompt, nice, informative, and thorough.  The food was great, I had a fantastic salad, and my bf had a sandwich which looked yummy.  When he realized it had bacon on it, and he doesn't eat pork, the waitress took it back no questions asked and had a new one made for him.  The manager stopped by to ask if everything was okay, and thanked us for coming in.  I would highly recommend Peppermill to anyone going to vegas for quality food, reasonable prices, fun atmosphere, and genuine service.",

It was relaxing watching music video's by the bubbling fire pit while sipping some good drinks at a good value.  I also agree with the comment that this would be a good place to eat after going on a bender.  I had an egg skillet that was HUGE and delicious with spicy sausage.  It almost reminded me of a garbage plate in a good way.",

    "text": "This would have been my second time going to this place I thought it was alright the first time 8 years ago. Well this time it wasna horrible experience when my wife and I arrived it was jammed packed there was a 45 min wait.  So we were offered to sit in the lounge to have a drink and wait for a table. Well we walked in and it was dark and it looked like a sex den out of the 70's tables were dirty and there were questionable stains on the cloth lounges I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet. But the kicker was that the Peppermill has a no hat policy in their lounge? Strange I had a hat on it was a tastful hat nothing gang related or any of that cliche stuff, I was asked to remove my hat because they had problems in the past with people wearing hats strange? I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd? So I asked her if I had an open wound or religous wrap hat on my head I would be refused services or would be asked to leave there lounge at this point I was bother by the BS policy the manager offered to see if she could bump up our table wait so im able eat in their dining room with my hat but cant drink in their lounge what BS. I was uncomfortable about the whole thing and I left. This nearly cost my vacation to be ruined cause my wife wanted to eat there still at the Peppermill and i refused too because their double standard unexplainable rule.",

Location is at the end of the Vegas strip by Circus Circus. They have a huge parking lot so parking is not a issue, woo hoo! Otherwise, the restaurant is pretty large and expect to wait. I think it is always busy here. When we arrived on Monday around 11:15 am we waited about 40 minutes to be seated. The nice thing about the venue is they have a bar/lounge area where guests can wait to be called. It is filled with red suede couches and a bar. They have servers come up to you if you want to order drinks while you wait. I did notice they have happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm where a majority of their drinks are $5.50 and lower, sweet! Once we were called we were taken to the restaurant part where it was bright with ample of seating. The menu offered lots of options from breakfast, lunch, dinner and appetizers. A ton of choices which made the picking hard! However, I went with the Marco Polo Omelette and man it did not disappoint! Omelettes come with hash browns and your choice of a bagel, English muffin or toast. My omelette had this wonderful hollandaise sauce and it was so good! My plate was $14.50 and it seemed a majority of plates were around that price point. Overall, great experience and if you want a keepsake they take a free photo and print it for you. Of course they try to up sell you, but not too aggressive. It was a nice free take home photo, nice touch Peppermill!",

Nothing super spectacular about the food but it was decent. And the portions were HUGE. You definitely get your monies worth. And the prices were dirt cheap might I add. I couldn't even attempt to eat all of my food.   I ordered a Scorpion cocktail as well. It was huge! You could definitely share it with 2 people. And the biggest perk is that you can take it with you to go if you don't finish it all in the restaurant.  I would definitely visit again!

It has been featured in many TV shows and famous movies (most notably \"Casino\" and \"Comedian in Cars getting Coffee\"), and it the perfect spot for a date or just a delicious (largely portioned) meal! Each entree is definitely enough for two people!",

The inviorment is fun and the food is great! lN all of my time coming here I have never had an experience like I had tonight...   Lilea was our \"server\" and was utterly and completely rude from the first  moment. There were 3 of us 2 being vegaterian. First she couldn't find the DOB on my husband's id (her long finger nail was covering it lol) she told him several times he wouldn't be allowed to stay and that his  ID was not  valid.  After he helped her find it she abruptly walked away without take my girlfriends drink...? We called her back and she was super irritated to take another drink order....? My girlfriend who has literally never eaten meat in her entire life ordered a cheese quesadilla. The server did not read back the order and about 10 minutes later brought out a chicken quesadilla then walked off (didnt even ask if we needed anything else).  After letting her know that it was the wrong quesadilla she said That she read the order back to us which was not the case nor would we have ordered a chicken quesidlla and then yelled at my husband saying you don't have to be so rude about the id. The people sittimg next to us who wayched the whole thing  got up leaving full drinks.  The hole thing was so very disappointing! I hope the gm reads this a firers Lilea",

This place was crowded and it's the food not just because it's on the strip and it's a vegas classic place to go, the food is really, really outstanding.  My husband ordered the Reuben with the marbled Rye this is his words...\"It was an experience that I did not want to end\". I had the Tangy Buffalo Wrap it was so good.  The onion rings are delicious as well.  The drinks are pricey but that is because your on the Strip.  3.25 is pricey for me but hey this place has the prices of Cheesecake Factory which is worth it because they give you a lot of food.  We are coming back to try the breakfast which we heard is excellent, all the hungover tourists and locals can't be wrong.",

No hostess at the stand. 2 of them talking amongst each other arguing... what were they arguing about? They were arguing about which one of them was going to seat us. We can here them. \"Its your turn!\" ... \"No, its your turn!\" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe. My wife ask them...\"Should we just seat ourselves?\" The hispanic looking one acts like she didnt see us.. \"Oh im sorry, how many in your party?\" Finally seated. Our waiter, waitress and another guy was really nice.. no problems with them or the food.   So half way through our food a family shows up. Ok cool, cute kids. A few minutes pass by, kids know everyone there. They walk in the back as they please. I see another waitress holding a baby trying to put it to sleep. I know this is a place of business, a restaurant business not a day care. It looked very unprofessional.   As im paying the bill (have to take the tab by the entrance) and there are slot machines. More kids and they're sitting in front of the slot machines. Some climbing on the chairs. I thought it was illegal to have kids sitting at any slot machine inside any place of business if they're underage (trust me the kids weren't older than 7 yrs old).  Great portioned sized food. Fairly priced. Just not somewhere I think I'll eat again.   I dont know,  just my observations.  They'll be closed the first week of Sept 2014.",

I arrived about 9:45 and the place was packed.  There was a waiting list for a table, but the counter was open so I went there.  Angela was my server and she immediately got me some coffee.  I have read about the big portions.  It starts with their over-sized coffee mugs.  Very nice.  I ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.  This is an institution that has been around for a lot of years and based on the people there today, it will be around for a lot more.",

Looking for a late night bite we found our way here because the reviews were pretty good and it was close by.  When we got inside it was an awkward ambience. The photos on yelp make it look a lot more appealing.  In person the feel is like a 1990's strip club with staff standing around talking to each other and not paying attention to their tables.  Our server was a young girl who was nice but completely lacked in the service area.  They should better train their staff to check on their tables.  We had to ask for our check after sitting there watching her talk to coworkers when we were ready to leave for quite some time.  I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want her to lose her job but honestly this place is just so bizarre and the food was barely mediocre.  Management needs to spend more time training the staff on basic hospitality.",

Good old diner fare served in large portions.  The sugar crystals on the table are multi-colored and there are faux trees and neon lights throughout.  The bar is awesome with a fire pit and music.  Of course, there are slot machines at the entrance!  You have to do it at least once while in town!",

From the super awkward, host who seemed to be on something to the super adorable busser, David we had a blast even before our food came. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was great but too heavy to eat in 100 degree weather, and my friend ordered the sirloin with the garlic mushrooms. I thought she messed up for a minute, I would never ever order steak in a diner but it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, I was green with food envy. Then it got real interesting, an older couple was sat in the booth in front of us, and the gentlemen was dressed kinda like a thug. Aka thug nasty... was the highlight of our trip. A year later we still talk and laugh about him like we know him, if anyone does know him can you tell him I'm looking for him?! I just want him to be real with us.",

Now one thing with the peppermill, is you may have to wait, but don't worry, you can make the most of your time by either playing at the slots they have or just chilling and having a mimosa in their fireside lounge. The fireside lounge has this 70s strip club kind of feel with its decor of red and dim lights. They have a multitude of drinks to choose from and you can go old school and get a White Russian or zombie.   Finally when you get seated, they have both a regular menu, but really is more famous is there breakfast menu. By the way, this is as good as any Vegas buffet, because their portions are insane and much tastier. Had the Maserati omelette and I was in heaven. How often can you have italian with breakfast? I wanted to eat more but I was so full. Sometimes wish I was a fatty so u could of eaten it all. Can't beat italian sausage with eggs covered with a tangy pasta red sauce. Delicious! Can't wait to go again!",

I ordered the tangy chicken wrap and my friend ordered the eggs beni. eggs beni was eggsellent! The tangy chicken wrap was a let down, I did not like the sauce for the chicken but I think this place overall has good food. I want to come back and order other items. We also ordered champagne drink which I do not recall the name that was delicious. Champagne with muddled strawberries. Service was fast and nice but ask for a cocktail waitress because our waitress didn't know much about the drink menu",

They have always had a good menu and the food is good as well.  It is no longer a locals place. I took 3 guys here for breakfast the other day and It cost me 60 bucks. I was a little surprised but I guess they have to keep the lights on.  Being on the strip is a big plus for the business but they are no longer the only place open all night  so I guess the locals have found a different hang out.  I will still go here when I am feeling nostalgic but the price will keep me from being a frequent visitor.",

Many memories of the Peppermill, from the fruit on the plate,  huge portions,  neon lights,  waitresses in short skirts,  cocktailers in long dresses.   The Vegas restaurant is almost identical,  so it was a blast from the past!   One huge difference was there was a long line of people to get in,  long wait times for a table.   If Marin's Peppermill had that issue,  they probably would have stayed in business!   We were able to get a seat at the counter immediately,  and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  We split the omelet,  hash browns,  English muffin,  and a giant pancake side.  Definitely share/split meals here!   Service was quick and friendly.     We really wanted to have a drink at the fire pit in the bar,  but it was being fixed.   The cocktail menu had all the classics,  and I was so looking forward to a Ramos fizz.   Next time for sure!   *girl to girl, woman to woman:  waitresses, be careful when you are reaching to get the food from the the higher heated counter.   The people at the bar got a lot of panty shots.*",

There is plastic bougainvillea everywhere, creating little oases of privacy, despite the mirrored ceilings.  Purple, pink, and turquoise lights add to the \"ambiance.\"  Nothing about this place is real.  It's Vegas, after all.  Get out of the hot Vegas sun and soak up some fireside kitsch.

It was in a huge cup with hot fudge covering the whole thing, although the layer was thin, the quality of the fudge was pretty decent.    The ambiance of this place is nice.. I can't remember anything else much like it.  For a 24hr diner, this is a decent choice.  The prices aren't that cheap for being outside of a casino, but it's still on the strip.

We tried to find one booth without a screen in front of our faces but no luck, so we ended up moving to the restaurant. I understand that some people like to go out and watch the game but people also like to go out to socialize face to face without the distraction of moving pictures everywhere. If they just turned off half the TVs and played some cool tropical vintage music (or any kind of music really) instead of blasting the TV announcer, they could create a really awesome atmosphere.",

I also noticed that she told that to every single customer that and they ended up waiting just as long as we did if not longer. The decor is different, unique. The waitresses were on point and it seemed like they all worked together. The food was pretty good - worth the wait, it was an awesome amount of food too!

That's always a good sign - a place has to be good if there are so many people willing to wait for the first meal of the day! Fortunately, there were a couple of seats available at the counter, and we asked the hostess if there was a queue for that. Nope!! So we just walked straight in and it was the most awesome feeling in the world - jumping a queue of about 30. Haha  Anyways, on to the food. GIANT portion sizes. I am a ravenous beast in the morning, and I could only make through half of my Marco Pollo Omelet and the monster portion of hash browns. My husband ordered the french toast, and got 3 (or was it 4?) huge slices with a mound of fruit on top. The food was not uniquely delicious, but it was satisfying. All in all, we left happy and content.  We will definitely return whenever we visit the sin city next!",

I also wasn't big on the service it took ten minutes for someone to acknowledge our group of four people. The arrival time was around 5pm.  Once seated I had already Google what I wanted so I ordered the Fish and Chips and a also had the recommended $16 drink.  My friend order breakfast, and the other order a bacon burger with onion rings.  Everyone was extremely pleased with the food. Another great thing was we arrived straight from the airport and the held my luggage for us behind the counter. I suggest you call before to verify the wait time.",

The service was mediocre, it seemed as if all the servers were in the weeds. If it wasn't for my companion and interesting conversation I would have been irritated a lot more quickly. It took us about 30 min to get an alcoholic beverage, due to the fact there's one drink waitress for the whole restaurant, or at least that's what it seemed like. No your food server doesn't take your alcohol order. I would rather try something new than to revisit.",

Fashion repeats itself...  Enough about the looks, you'll see it for yourself.  The portion are decently large, but that didn't stop me from pouding my burger, fries and eating a handful more of sweet potato fries off my friend's plate.  The chicken focaccia is a pretty big hit, with pesto sauce, it's always a good time.  The chicken was so tender and I shouldn't be shocked, but it was tasty.    The word is, the chocolate milk shake look enticing, but hardly worth the calories since it taste worse than Hershey's chocolate.  If you're a breakfast person, you can eat here anytime 24/7, as this joint serves it all.    The worst service was the lone cocktail waitress that serves the entire restaurant was no where to be found, after 3 different waitresses requested for her to come by our booth.  If you want a drink, you just might have to find the bartender yourself.    We went home with a free souvenier picture and the suckers we are, one of us spent $20 to get another photo =)  All in good fun!  A must try in Vegas if you have time to kill.",

The service is very friendly/laid back but one weird thing is if you order a drink they have to send a separate cocktail waitress from the attached lounge to take your drink order.   As for the food itself, the Baja Burger was just right with some green chiles, pepper jack cheese, and bacon along with a side of homemade onion rings . The Corona-rita is a giant margarita with a Corona bottle attached and it the perfect accompaniment to a huge burger.  They have a gigantic menu and I'll be back here to check this place out again.",

Their breakfast is great too. I LOVE the biscuits and gravy. You get a huge soup bowl full of gravy with biscuits in it. Of all the times I have ate here, I have never run out of gravy.   They also come around and take a photo of you and the people you're with. One postcard size is free, but if you want any others you have to pay $19+ per photo.",

But instead it had shrimp, crab meat (which I assume was imitation), \"American\" cheese and hollandaise sauce. What exactly is mediteranean about that? Definitely would not recommend this place.

Oh yeah, and it's got neon lights, to distract you from the fact that it's still not much better than Kady's, which I gave 2 stars.    The portions here are massive, so if you need a good hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking, this will surely fill you up and grease you up.    However, if it is possible to venture out a little further, and wait for a good meal, the nicer hotels tend actually have decent breakfasts, so long as you avoid the buffets.",

I love the 50's diner look from the outside, the massive portions of virtually anything you can chow down either at a table or at the counter in the restaurant. Nachos are great, huge and perfect for that: \"it's 4am and I need food, stat\" moment; best shared with a friend or 12. Breakfast foods are equally large portions: pancake lovers rave over their stacks; many of my burger loving friends have raved about the burgers. I usually have a gynormous salad, while iceberg isn't my favorite, it is more than adequate here (I never leave without a to-go box) Love that they are open 24/7 and the kitschy decor in the diner. There can be relatively long waits during breakfast hours and at seemingly random times. Worth the wait. Also, it is easy walking distance from many spots on the Strip, so you can walk off some of those drinks/nachos. Recently walked from TI & Bellagio.   Just the diner side would make this great to this NYer who misses a diner. But then...you walk into the Fireside Lounge and are transported into the 1970's (overheard a man telling his wife \"it looks like a den of iniquity\")  Velvet couches in the round with flat screens playing old school videos, plus the famous floating fireplace add to the unique ambience; there are even matchbooks at your tables. There are gaming spots at bar, if that's your thing.   Drinks follow the throwback theme along with Mai Tais, Scorpions & other \"Girl Drink Drunk\" offerings (check out classic Kids in the Hall skit on You Tube, riff on Days of Wine and Roses but very Vegas) and unique dessert themed libations. There's frequently a roving photographer to present a memento of what always turns out to be a good time for local and tourists alike.   The waitresses wear long black cocktail dresses, and do the classic \"Bunny dip\" to place coasters and serve -- reminiscent of the old Playboy Clubs -- there's a decent array of  bar food and appetizers. On my last trip in April we had Caprese Salad (very good) Shrimp Cocktail (a ok) Chicken Quesadillas (really good, very flaky but took forever to come out) and something else I didn't eat but my friend enjoyed it. Drinks are potent, service can be a tad slow, but friendly. Our water glasses were always filled, drinks refreshed and waitress did keep in touch regarding wayward item.   The people watching alone is worth a visit. Depending on what time you are there, you'll start to see hungry clubbers, hungry/thirsty \"dancers \" and just your variety of only-in-Vegas sightings. From about 3AM on it gets really shall we say, eclectic?'   So, I'm a fan. Always have been, always will be. It is a cool spot to chow down, get your drink on or snuggle up to your honey. Long live The Peppermill!",

    "text": "Ok so maybe my expectations were too high, everyone kept recommending this place saying how awesome the food was. It was Sunday, a few hours before we had to fly home. We usually like to hit someplace unique to vegas, something like hash house a go go or oyster bar before flying home. The cab driver mentioned Peppermill and since we have always heard great things decided to try it. Nothing was bad, but everything was just ordinary, except maybe the size of the plates. Peppermill burger was just ho hum, chicken fried steak and eggs - no different from anything else. The interior was cool, waitress was awesome. To me tho it's just an ordinary diner, can't imagine going back for anything really",

    "text": "I've been meaning to start writing Yelp reviews for a while now, and I've repeatedly considered what business would receive my first review. I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars.  (For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.)  My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.  Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.  My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.  The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem.",

I loved the multi-colored sugar on the table, the kitschy decor, and even the huge portions, which are typical for diner establishments, but the food just wasn't that good even under the influence of alcohol.  The Peppermill is considered to be a LV institution with extremely kitschy decor (think of fake trees, neon lights and vinyl wrap-around booths). It's right across the street from Circus Circus, giving it somewhat of a creepy vibe at night. This area of the strip just feels dead now.   My review is based mainly on the food, which was surprisingly lackluster. I expected it to be at least better then IHOP, but it reminded me of Denny's. I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty greasy and my friend's salad was made out of iceberg lettuce with huge piles of fruit that looked unappetizing. My sweet potato fries were okay, but tasted like they were previously frozen.  I would have given it a higher rating, but I expect diners to have good \"junk food.\" I think The Peppermill may be better for breakfast, and it's definitely worth a stop if you are interested in Vintage Las Vegas. Also noteworthy is procuring a bag of multi-colored sugar (yes, they do sell it at the register)!",

We arrived around 11 and were seated right away. This lady jacked us for $10 saying she would give us a free postcard photo. The photo on the postcard was hella small, so we had to buy the bigger version for $10. Mom and I split a Rueben (salty and too much bread) and bran muffins which were most excellent. Dad said the egg Benedict sucked, and bf said his omelette was really heavy and just ok. Maybe I will just picked up some muffins to go next time. By the time we left there was a line out the door!",

The burger tastes charred, the gyro seemed like frozen meat and the turkey in the salad looked canned. The ice cream was good, but I'm assuming it was store bought.   The one star is for the entire staff being cheerful and either sadly believing this food is good, or being able to fake it for so long with a smile.",

The hot wings are decent at best, Munch's breakfast which is similar to a breakfast hash was not bad but not that good and I also ordered Joe's San Francisco special, which was definitely the best dish I had their.  Even this dish was maybe a 2 star at best, the only positive of this place is having fun watching the waitresses picking things up off the floor.

    "text": "This restaurant is so ... Vegas, in all good and tacky senses.  THE ATMOSPHERE: It feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.  THE DECOR: Being inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.  I fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful.   THE FOOD: The coffee, so necessary after any 1/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.  My friends and I shared: 1) Munch's breakfast, which was sauteed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about. 2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering.   With your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.  Finally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!  In all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.  Will definitely be adding this to my Vegas rotations.",

Walking in the restaurant scared me abit because I thought we entered a strip club on accident.  We were seated promptly and given our drinks. The waitress was friendly and aided us in finding good choices on the menu. I ordered a sandwich called the conquest, and it was good. Loaded with various meats and toppings, you won't be leaving hungry. The portion sizes of the food are more than adequate for the cost.  The only downside I had was they were out of bud light, even though they had a giant banner advertising a special on the front of the building. I was happy with the experience though and will return.",

Their omelets are so large that you can easily split one between two persons and they are very, very good!! My experienced estimate is that they contain around 12 eggs. The included sides of toast and hash browns will top you off with a smile. The hash browns were excellent!!    I wish there was a Peppermill restaurant here in Sacramento!",

    "text": "YAAAAAAASSSSSS  I have tried to hit up Peppermill on my last TWO Vegas visits, but circumstances prevented a drop-in. Looks like third time's a charm, because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill, and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two.  Peppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe, so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that). Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling, lush fake foliage abound, vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table, while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast. No, seriously. IMAGINE.  Both mornings, we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious \"Fireside Lounge\" door. The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here, as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas, and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit. It feels good for about 18 second before it's absolutely too hot to be down there, but you don't leave because it's just. too. cool. Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby's head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya!), served by a young lady in a satin prom dress, before being whisked away to your dining experience.  Breakfast on both mornings was deelish. Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict, while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo. Both were extra tasty. On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility, though it wasn't on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass. I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR!   Pretty much I wanna be here like 'erry day.",

A recent rendezvous with an old coworker proved it the same, esp considering the nostalgia of old times sitting in the same booth-like tables with old friends.  After ordering a couple moderately priced drinks, the inevitable happens....snackage ensues!   First thing noted...portions are HUGE.  Very share friendly piled-high plates, where each feed 2-3 eager loungers.  Nachos Nachos Nachos ($16.95): Chicken, Refried Beans, Mixed Cheeses, Jalapenos, Tomatoes, Onions & Black Olives. Monstrous portions, good flavor, with plenty of cheese to scare away the lactose. You WILL make a mess btw LOL   20 Buffalo Wings ($17.95): BBQ & Hot. The BBQ sauce is semi-sweet, but the hot left spiciness desired. Cooked well, still juicy on the insides and over-sauced.  You will find better food out there...cheaper drinks...better lounges...  But I feel like Peppermill is a great mix of the three, one for locals and vistors alike.",

There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.  The dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.  I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.  Overall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds. It is quite popular, but also worth it.",

Parking was ample and the place was very busy inside. Even with a first day on the job waitress, everything went pretty well. Really want to give the extra star, but there really wasn't enough to justify it. Food was good and portions were on the large side, but If you are on a diet and tempted to over eat, don't go here. If you want an oversized Vegas sized meal, it will fit the bill. The quality was slightly above average and that is probably the best way to describe the four star review.",

If you like pink neon lights, disco balls and dusty fake plants, you are in for a treat!   I personally prefer the fireside lounge, I am not a big fan of the restaurant, mostly because the food is basically Denny's but twice the price, but the bar is another story.  If you get to the lounge early enough, then you will be lucky enough to sit in the velvet pie slice benches around the fire coming out from a water feature. This is the place to be!   I love their drinks, there are delicious and well priced. The fancy waitresses wearing prom gowns are very friendly and attentive.    I love their pineapple mojitos! I can't wait to go back!

Went with some friends on a Saturday night for dinner and even though they were very busy we didn't have a wait and the staff was nothing but friendly and fast.   Since most of the food is diner \"Americana\" and they serve breakfast all day the meal came out quickly (15 mins). I indulged in some massive pancakes and my friends had big salads, sandwiches and pasta. Everything was delicious and for two it was about $28 w/sodas.  The design inside is hard to explain other than quirky and colorful and they have a massive menu (think Cheesecake Factory) so in general there is plenty to choose for everyone. I highly recommend this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive restaurants on the strip and will be visiting again next time I'm in town.",

Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was \"Yes\" and \"Please\".  I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.  This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.  I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.",

    "text": "It's surprising to see the 5-star reviews of this place. Not that it's bad, but it's not worthy of 5-stars. You come here for the quirkiness and the big plates of diner food. The service can be hit or miss - sometimes they are on their A game, other times you never see your waitress. Adding to this is having to wait on a cocktail waitress to order drinks.   Good Highlights: I appreciate being able to order a fresh salad from a diner. Their Southwest Salad is huge and tasty.   Front door parking  Kid-friendly  Diverse menu - something for everyone  Bad Highlights: Hit or miss service  Fireside Lounge - If you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their Lounge. I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.  Just a general observation for Vegas newbies: I see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. A $29 ribeye on the strip IS a steal.",

The interior was fun. I've never seen the inside of a slot machine, but I imagine it looks a lot like that.  We stopped here before seeing a show at the Wynn, so we just ordered appetizers of crab cakes and mozzarella sticks. Both were par with the course, nothing too special. I did really enjoy the red pepper sauce that was paired with the crab cakes. I felt that it was just a bit too expensive for what was offered. I understand it's on the strip, but restaurants that are *in* the casinos are charging comparable--if not better--prices.  My chief complaint would be the service. We had three different servers for one meal. A cocktail server, food server, and someone who strictly refilled water. It just slowed things down and seemed counterintuitive to me.",

The waitress attended us really fast and they also had a cocktail waitress she was also very nice and quick to answer our drink special questions. We shared a plate of crab cakes and a cesar salad. Very delicious! We decided to share plates since the plates are pretty big. We ordered chicken Alfredo with garlic bread. I honestly thought the pasta was really dry. As for him he really liked it. They took a professional photo in the booth and we decided to take the smaller photo for free.  Don't forget to stop by they're fire side bar. Very relaxing with chill music. You can order a small appetizer and drinks. I truly loved the martinis. I had a key lime martini. Overall what a great experience at the Peppermill we will def be back on our next visit to Las Vegas and try other items from the menus. Thank you!",

The inside decor is so completely untouched from its past life in the 80s, it's actually a pretty cool scene. Turquoise and pink can be found just about everywhere, so if you weren't around for those good old times, this place will seem very strange and outdated. Go in prepared for the nostalgia, and you will have a great experience.   Service was excellent from the hostess to the waitress. We even had a manager swing by and make sure all was well. This was also by far the best value and quality for your buck that we found during our stay.   Our food was all excellent with huge portions with quality ingredients. Their specialty burger on Texas Toast was hearty as all heck, and their Turkey Club with onion rings was a colossal masterpiece! The all day breakfast offering with Chicken Fried Steak was also a hit with a tender steak and the Reuben was one of the best my buddy had eaten in a long time with a generous portion of Pastrami.   As if all of that isn't good enough, they are open 24/7 for all of you Vegas night owls!",

I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was alright, just not enough seasoning. We did have mild wings as an appetizer and those were the BOMB.COM! The drinks were also pretty good as well. Our waitress Katelyn was really nice as well and moved with a sense or urgency when we needed something.",

    "text": "Apparently The Peppermill is a Vegas staple! I had no idea, but then my boyfriend suggested going and let's just say that I 100% understand why now.   We went for a late lunch on a Saturday. Originally, we thought we needed reservations, but they don't do reservations for lunch. However, you can call ahead and get put on the list. So we did that about 30 minutes before we arrived. I'm glad we did! There was no wait because we were already on the list... had we not been on the list, the hostess said it would be about 20-25 minutes of waiting. No thanks.   This place is so Vegas. Mirrored ceilings, bright colored lights, fake trees, gaudy decor to the extreme. I loved it.   The menu is pretty broad, with breakfast served all day and a wide variety of sandwiches, burgers, and entrees for lunch/dinner times. I ordered the Peppermill burger and my boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger. The portions were HUGE. We each could only eat half of our burgers. It came with fries and honestly... they were underwhelming. Nothing special there. Although we didn't order cocktails, we did see some of their specialty cocktails being served and they were HUGE! The dessert menu looked really tempting, so I'll be back soon just for dessert.   The price was pretty standard for The Strip - a little over priced but not outrageous. I think for the two of us, the check came out to under $40 for the 2 burgers & 1 soda.   I can't wait to go back and try the desserts... mmmmmmm!!!",

In this instance, I decided to grab a quick breakfast on the way to the strip and thought this would be a tasteful option. For sure the food is greatly within its limits to match the price, so no complaints there. The service also is amazing which gave a plus as well, but the food wasn't the best. It reminded me of regular Coney Island breakfast but with a bigger portion of your food items. A friend suggested that I order something more enriched in flavors, which I agree I definitely will next time.",

    "text": "Came here twice with family during my Christmas break trip to Las Vegas. It was within walking distance of our hotel and my brother had heard good things from a friend.  Both times, we were quoted a 20-25 minute wait. It might have been a bit longer, than that, but we didn't mind because we decided to go into the lounge area for a drink while we waited. The lounge is off of the main dining room and is a dark oasis with a cool fire pit seating area. The first time we went, it was 10 AM, but it felt like we were in da club! ha. They played music videos above the fire pit and the waitress came by to take our drink orders. The only downside of this area is that people can smoke, but that's Vegas...  They called out names over the loud speaker, so we didn't have to worry about missing our table due to being in the lounge area. Both trips, we got a round, paid and were ready to be seated at the breakfast table when they called us.  The food was pretty darn good. Both times, I got the ham and cheese omelet which came with hash browns and choice of carb. I opted for the blueberry muffin which was served warm with butter. Killer! Everyone was similarly happy with the food. One downside was that the service was spotty. They were friendly, but maybe overworked because the place was really busy. On our second trip, my dad had to ask 3 times for the cocktail waitress so that he could order a mimosa.  As others have stated, the portion sizes are huge! You can definitely share or have plenty of leftovers. The price is decent for the quality and the amount of food you get. I would definitely come back here when I'm in Vegas again.",

First of all we were very chocked by the way the staff behaved, hardly welcome or talked to us, chewing gums, tipping on their phone as if nobody could see them, one of them even ate a fries from a plate he was bringing to a customer, seriously ?!?. What a shame ! We got steaks, French fries, onion rings and salads. My Caprese salad that consisted of sliced tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil was not fresh at all I'm sure. Just looking at the color of the cheese I knew something was wrong. But I was starving and ate it anyway. Too bad I did : by the time I got home I was SO sick !!! My friends were not doing well either but me I spent my night and the next day running between my bed and the bathroom. Awful pain ! Read on some Facebook group that other people experienced the same symptoms so DON'T GO !!!",

The staff is friendly and constantly checks on you to make sure you have everything you need. The old style diner theme couples well with the dining room decor. Order whatever you want on the menu. I guarantee it will taste great. Normally, I get some sandwich with the curly fries. The curly fries are amazing...like Arby's curly fries on steroids. If you find yourself of the strip and haven't been here, you need to try it at least once. You won't be disappointed. Try to avoid the busier times though as it can get crowded and very loud.",

You may find yourself paying $25 for a fruit salad but it came out bigger than your entire head, you're sure to want to selfie with it. It was a clever idea for someone in our group to order a fruit plate since the rest of our dishes were all gigantic and filled with goodies.   Really loved the country ham and eggs, it was so flavorful. I wish my vegetarian friend ate meat since her omelette was on the bland side. But at the same time we couldn't feel too sorry for her since hers came with a Banana bread with a side of marshmallow creme, OMG the Banana bread is a mini loaf that's bigger than my two fists! It came out piping hot and dunking it in the sweetened creme was the highlight of our meal. Hubby liked his burger too, I remember the curly fries were fun to eat.   Be sure to check out the fire pit cocktail lounge before you head out, heard it's one of the biggest of its kind!",

We had a table of 8 and not one person was able, or even tried, to finish their meal. Everything was HUGE. Best to share an entree with 1 or 2 people. The service was fantastic.

We heard that the Peppermill was a great place to go, so we decided to check it out.  There was about a twenty minute wait, so we went outside and walked around for a while. When we got back, there was only one table ahead of us and we were seated shortly after.   The decor of the restaurant is truly unique. It felt like we were at a special event. That feeling was supported by the fact that someone was walking around taking commemorative pictures for each table.   The menu was quite extensive and everything looked enticing. To help with our decision making, we looked around the restaurant at what order people had ordered. This did not help in the slightest as all of the food looked delicious and the portions were colossal.   We ultimately chose an order of buffalo wings, gyros, onions rings, and three fried eggs. All of the food was really tasty. The wings were gigantic and had the perfect amount of heat to them. The gyro meat was flavorful and the pita bread was nicely toasted. The onion rings were piping hot and not greasy. Even though we were really hungry, we were still unable to eat all of our food due to the large portion size.   While the food, service, and ambience were top notch, I am going to deduct a star for not accepting credit cards. Las Vegas isn't some small town in the middle of nowhere. There is no excuse to be cash only in 2017. We would have ordered drinks too if I wasn't capped by the cash in my wallet.   Overall though, the Peppermill is a great place to eat and is well worth the trip to the north of the Strip.",

We weren't that hungry, so went to the Fireside lounge instead of the main restaurant. We sat at the bar and played video poker and they comped our drinks.   They have an extensive specialty drink list. got the frozen chocolate banana drink. OMG...so good!!  Well worth the $10 price, even better when it was free.   We ordered nachos with some of the ingredients only in half and it came out correctly.   Definitely an old school Vegas place and the decor fits that. Everything looked clean and the service was good.",

Typical Vegas prices too. I might come back if i was at the Wynn again because it is so close, but I would probably try something else.",

We ordered the pickle fries for an appetizer, best fried pickles I've had in a while. I got the French dip sandwich with au jus and fries. The amount of food I got was great, for the price! I did order a cocktail and it tasted like there was no alcohol in the drink. We were told they only put a 1 ounce shot in the drink, which we couldn't even taste.. the flavor was nice but i couldn't taste the alcohol. We ordered the brownie dessert and it was SO GOOD. The hot fudge was my favorite part of the whole dinner. I would definitely recommend this place and we will be going back.",

It was really night on our first night in Vegas and most places are closed in our hotel except for hotdogs, burgers, sandwiches, etc. We wanted something more, but not pay the Resort price of our food, so we walked over to this lovely little gem. First, let me just advise you that the colorful crystals on the table is sugar. My sister kept staring at the jar in amazement and my other sister and I couldn't stop laughing at her. Anyways, onto our dinners. We all ordered breakfast. My sister had the omelet, and let me tell you, it was GINORMOUS! A normal omelet probably has about 3 eggs, this one probably had a dozen eggs. It was SO LARGE that she probably laid an egg herself later on. I got the typical eggs, bacon and muffin meal as I wasn't as hungry. It was decent and filling, and usually I never regret getting bacon, but I did. My parents had the sausage and it tasted like it was smoked in apple wood. It was so good!! This establishment is a must if you want better than Denny's but not pay the price of the casinos.",

I came here to get away from the strip feel for a minute and it was worth it. Sat at the counter an enjoyed wings, a burger and a few pints and all were great and it cost me less that a single steak at a big hotel. Staff was attentive and fun to chat with. Kaitlin was my server and as engaged her she reinforced the history here as a second generation server and had some great history and facts about the place and uniforms. Get in here, you and your wallet will be happy you did.",

    "text": "WELL KISS MY GRITS!  I have lived in Las Vegas for just over ten years now. Finally I have made it to the Peppermill. Service was a little disappointing, but not so bad to kill this review. My wife and I went on a Friday close to 11:20am. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes until a table was ready; we were invited to wait inside the Fireside Lounge.  My wife and I don't drink but LOVED the atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge. We literally sat fireside, watching the atmosphere, looking over the menu, this is where I discovered that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had dined at The Peppermill. Personally I think that's cool. As if it were on cue, our table was ready in 20-25 minutes.  As we sat, at our booth, Hope you like booth seating. Unless you are at bar we will be seated in a booth! Our server arrived soon after. We were overlooking the menu still as the waitress took our drink orders. When she returned we still needed time to decide. Our waitress said \"I'll be back\" as if our not ordering yet was an inconvenience for her.   The food was fine. Typical diner like fare. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I ate a  Philly Cheese Steak, Savory u.s.d.a. choice beef strips flash - sauteed with strips of onion, bell peppers, sliced tomato and smothered with provolone on a grilled steak roll. My wife ate what was called, Conquest, Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, sauteed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough. The meal reminded me a lot of eating at a diner like Denny's. When I mentioned this to my wife she fully agreed.   As we were eating, a lady with camera walked by and asked if we would like to pose for a souvenir picture. We agreed.The lady with camera said she would return as soon as we were done with out meals. But alas she never returned. The meal was all but over. My plate was empty; my wife still had a few onion rings on her plate. Our waitress came by and asked how we enjoyed our meals. As we were answering, she took the plates, without asking if my wife wanted those remaining onion rings.  WELL KISS MY GRITS!  As we were leaving we walked right by that lady with a camera, who never returned to take out picture.",

I had this place on my bucket list for some time and was so excited- complete letdown. Group of 4  our orders included Phillycheese with onion rings, Italian omelet with tomatoes as side, hamburger with fries & broccoli cheese soup I would compare overall taste with  Denny's or other chain restaurants these items with marginal tip over $70 bucks. Waitress SLOW, food wait excessively long for amount of patrons they had . No fun music No atmosphere really at all. Only slightly redeeming quality is the do offer a free souvenir photo. My advice so many unique restaurants in Vegas - give this one a pass.",

Now, the atmosphere was awesome, and i really wish i went back at night time. I probably wouldn't eat here again, but might go back for the fireside lounge.",

I looked at the reviews here on yelp before coming and was extremely excited to come but it just didn't meet my expectations. Another thing we sat by the bar and I honestly think my pasta was precooked, they most likely just shoved it in the over to warm up. I gave a 3 star Bc the waiters were pretty nice!",

Had breakfast in the \"restaurant section\" during morning rush and regretted it, but overall a pleasant experience  Off-hours visits are a must... and don't go here if you have epilepsy!     ** Details **  Heard great but conflicting things about The Peppermill.  It was described as: \"a great bar\", \"a great breakfast diner\", \"a great lounge\", \"a great coffee shop\", \"a great late-night hang out\", and \"a great nudie bar\".  It was all those things.  I should have taken my friend's advice and visited the Peppermill's lounge in the late evening instead of having breakfast in the restaurant.  As far as breakfast goes, it was good but fairly normal... except for the 60 minute wait.  Go!",

I'm assuming it was quality food and equally tasty because I didn't puke.   One important detail I do remember. I was soo incredibly nauseated and dizzy. The waitress helped me with a glass of ice cold water and basically led me to the women's bathroom. She could tell I was a hot mess. I wish I could remember her name so I could call back and thank her and let her manager know she went above and beyond.   I wouldn't advise going alone-- it's sketchy. The outside environment. Or, is it perfectly safe and I'm still hungover writing this review? Oh, damn you, Vegas.",

It was really good, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes french toast and fruit. I noticed that other patrons of the restaurant were often taking doggie bags with them. I would have, had I had any time before returning home to eat my leftovers.  The beer selection wasn't very good, so I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking for beer. It was a bit strange, too, when ordering. Someone came to take the drink order, but couldn't bring beer, so they sent over a cocktail waitress. There was yet another waitress that handled the food. Strange, but not a big deal.  The environment here is sort of fun, with lots of fake plant decorations everywhere.",

We came here because our limo driver convinced us it was popular and good.   This place is a diner. The inside is very colorful as in purple, green, turquoise, yellow. From what I remember jungle themed.  Inside its a bit sketchy. Nothing like the other restaurants on the strip. Crowd was a bit more \"hood\" or \"ghetto\". Please don't hate me for these comments.   We ordered a grilled chicken burger and a basket of fruit to go. The 2 others we were with stayed to dine in. They got breakfast. Lets just say they finished eating before we got our take out order. Once our order finally came she forgot our fruit basket and the check. We almost ended up leaving at the same time as the 2 that actually stayed and dined in.   Service was terrible!!!!!    I think I have to come back, dine in and try their breakfast.",

    "text": "Omigod, I don't know how we managed to miss this place in the 9 or so years we've been in Vegas!  I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.  I was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.  The omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said \"about 10.\"  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.  We didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.  This all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!  Peppermill is the closest thing to our beloved East Coast Greek diners, but in True Vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  In a good way.",

There are these giant fake cherry blossom trees, and planter after planter of fake plants and flowers.  Just think, the cheesiest place imaginable.   You may come here to be entertained by the cheesy atmosphere, but you definitely come here for the amazing food.  The portions are enormous! Definitely big enough for two to split.  We got one garden omelette, a fruit cup, and an order of eggs Benedict to share for three people.  It was more than enough food.    While the food and the service were both excellent, the only bummer of this visit was the 30 plus minute ticket time to get our food.  The server repeatedly apologized, and was kind enough to not charge us for our coffee, iced tea and oj.  This is the minus one star.  Otherwise this place rocks!",

They have an amazing and extensive menu - anything you could possibly be craving, they got it. We ordered a steak omelette (not on the menu, but you can ask for one) and a steak with fettuccine Alfredo. The cocktail waitress comes separately than the server and our drinks were stiff and fairly priced (for Vegas). A girl taking photos also comes around, and it's the basic drill. You get one photo for free (a souvenir style with your photo placed amongst a collage of the Peppermill) and then you can purchase additional full size photos. As for our food, I truly enjoyed my steak. I asked for medium rare, and it was tasty, but could have used a bit less cooking - I enjoyed it though. Fettuccine was awesome. After we ate we spent some time in the lounge which basically looks like a strip club - and that is awesome! Very comfy and kitschy. This is going to be a staple on any future Vegas trips.",

After visiting on our last trip and immensely enjoying the food and experience,  the wife and I chose to revisit for our wedding celebration to share the french toast ambrosia and a few drinks before heading back to the hotel. Awful. The french toast was undercooked and unappealing while the fruit itself was not ripe or much beyond edible. The fruit salad and french toast on our flight home on Delta was ten times better and very delicious. It's sad when airline food is better than the Peppermill. I had a Mai Tai and the wife had an espresso martini (which was horrible).  As for service, eh, it was okay, she brought us drinks and our food. We didn't tip and that is rare. We finished our one drink each and made a hasty retreat. Overall, save yourself and don't go. We won't be returning.",

We stopped by Vegas, coming back from a roadtrip from Colorado to California, so you can imagine the exhaustion we all were feeling, hoping that a good meal would revitalize us.  This place had some high reviews and it's labeled \"American Traditional Breakfast\".  Once you step in the place it has that Vegas ambience with slot machines out in the front, then you actually walk into the restaurant and it's like a blast from the past, tacky 80s decor. Neon lights, dark dim lighting, tacky carpet, tacky lamps, everything is so tacky. It's not even a nostalgic, retro tacky. It's like that horrible decor your estranged aunt on your mother's side uses. Bleh.  Waitresses and busboys were generally polite, but also kinda ignored us... they were busy, wont hold it against them. Plus they have to wear these awful uniforms.  I ordered an omelet, I forget which one, but I remember it being HUGE and full of scallions. They could have chilled out on the scallions... My cousin got the biscuits and gravey, and it wasn't anything special. Just two biscuits and a heaping pile of gravy. The portion was too big for such plain flavors. My mom ordered the eggs benedict and her face of disappointment made me not even want to try it. She said it wasn't bad though, but my mom is usually too nice for her own good. I also got orange juice and I never imagined being disappointed with orange juice... it had a weird flavor to it... like they added sugar to a fresh squeezed OJ. Why would you do that if that is what you did....  I left pretty angry and dissatisfied.",

The ambiance is very noisy, colorful, neon & Art Deco.   Service was poor. We had to ask for a cocktail waitress 4 times about 25 minutes after seating before we got to order drinks. They have a system where a waitress from the lounge area serves alcoholic beverages. The regular restaurant server does not. Prices were very reasonable. We ordered a bottle of wine from the small list that they had. Also tried a specialty cocktail. It was too sweet and tasted very artificial.   The food portion was pretty big. Porterhouse didn't look very appetizing. The ribeye was good. Crab cakes were decent. Overall food was mediocre at best.   After dinner we went over to the lounge side where the fire pit is. Fire pit was crowded so we sat at a large booth nearby and order drinks. We ordered Old Fashions, Moscow Mule & Mandrin Vodka/Soda. The drinks were weak and watered down.   Overall we enjoyed ourselves cause we had great company with us. I probably won't be back here anytime soon. Possibly in 20+ years.",

Back in 2005 a buddy of mine brought me her on a birthday weekend.  It was a Sunday just before we headed back home to CA on a hot Summer July morning.  We were completely smashed from the night before and he said lets have a bloody Mary.    OMG he came back from the fireside with these wonderfully spicy B Mary's and I was hooked.  On this morning I had the tostada omelette.  I had asked my son to share his order with me but he said no I can eat dad.  So I challenged him.  Being that I have been here several times I knew the portions were large.  So I ordered my own and told him he better eat it all.  Guess what he did! He threw back at me and said \"you better eat all of yours\".  So about half way he gave up I didn't show it but I was done too.  The waitress came by and asked him if he wanted his, he said \"no\" I was like \"what happen\"?  Waitress \" don't worry honey there's 10 eggs in there you did a good job!\"   Jaw drop! quite in the restaurant you could hear a pin drop.  The challenge was on!  As i cut through the omelet I could see the layers of tostada, ground beef, guacamole sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  Its warm goodness got me so full so quickly.  It got hot in there too, the salsa had just enough bite.  I ate it all and rubbed the victory in my sons face and he laughed, said \"your gonna be sick!\"  Go to the Peppermill great food drinks and experiences.",

I went to Vegas couple months ago and when we arrived at 10 pm we checked into our hotel and ate here since it was five min from our hotel. My husband had heard of it and wanted to try it so we went. I can say now that this restaurant alone is worth going back to Vegas lol it's a retro diner with good food and drinks. It has a lounge as well but we didn't end up going to the lounge but we will this year when we return to Vegas. The portions are slightly bigger than other places but the food is great and prices are decent for what it is. Service was great despite the hour we went. They are open late. I can't wait to go back :)",

Honestly any of them would be a very good option.  If you like waffles or french toast get one of the Fantasia or Ambrosia ones!  The Fresh fruit, Blueberry syrup and Whipped cream are fantastic!  On the weekends the wait can be up to an hour.  You can wait in the lounge and order a cocktail during that time. It is worth the wait!",

    "text": "The Peppermill is absolutely my favorite place to stay in Reno, so when we asked someone for a breakfast recommendation in Las Vegas last weekend, I was happy to jump on the suggestion of heading to Peppermill LV. We were cutting it pretty close to having to be at the airport, but had roughly an hour so the 20 minute wait didn't scare us off.  We sat at the bar and each enjoyed a couple of frozen, blended, strawberry drinks (about $12 each) and lots of conversation with the bartenders and waitresses picking up drinks, before our name was called and we were seated. A coffee ($4) was brought quickly and orders were taken fast too. Everything was off to a great start!   My boyfriend ordered an omelette and hashbrowns for brunch. I ordered 3 eggs over-medium ($4), a bowl of country gravy, and a side of onion rings to dip in the gravy and egg yolk. I know, I know...  kinda weird but the rings on the table next too us looked too good to miss. Food finally came out (HUGE omelette and plate of hash $14!!) - everything arrived but the onion rings - which we were told would be there soon. So I ate my eggs. And then a bowl of gravy with a spoon. As I finished the last bite, we received another apology from Sophia for the untimeliness (still no rings) so at this point, since we'd finished eating, I begrudgingly had her cancel the order.  No offer to bring them out in a to-go box or anything...! Shouldn't they be almost done? I was really disappointed they messed up my breakfast order and did nothing to fix it. I had nothing to dip in my eggs or gravy, yet was still charged for the $3 side, which I ended up having to eat by eatself! No offer for toast.... anything?! Luckily, the airport was close so we had more food and drinks there while waiting for our delayed flight.  I totally understand when something goes wrong in a kitchen, or there's a miscommunication with staff, but in most instances, the best thing to do is not make the customer suffer as a result. If they cooked the onion rings anyway, all I can imagine is maybe they'd rather keep them for themselves than give them up for free to a hungry customer - from the way they looked on the table next to us, that's probably what happened. I imagine they're delicious! Very surprising coming from a place that staples a comment card to your receipt.",

The pancakes are big but not a lot of flavor. Denny's is smaller but better tasting. It was a good experience and with all the hubbub about it, I HAD to go see for myself and you will too. The service was good, the atmosphere was good so that's why I gave it 3 stars. It's a one and done for me.",

The rest of the meal was reasonable priced and tasted good. Do yourself a favor and don't pay hotel prices and venture out for good food at good prices.",

    "text": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I are bartenders and know how the whole restaurant deal goes. We came in around 5am for breakfast and we get it: It's early in the morning, drunk people are still coming by to eat, plastered from the clubs, it gets annoying.   Once we arrived, I was super stoked to eat. It's beautiful inside with the neon lights and a retro Diner! It was so cool looking.  Food: I got the eggs Benedict with the poached eggs and he got the crab cake Benedict with poached eggs. The eggs were NOT poached but mine was still delicious, he wasn't so hot on the crab cakes.  Drinks: We started off with waters and decided to get Bloody Mary's since I saw a few reviews saying they were delicious, so we gave it a go! First off, the cocktail waitress took 15 minutes to get to us and the bar was not busy and the restaurant itself wasn't that crowded. She finally came by and we decided to get mild spice with Kettle One Vodka (for 2 - $21). Keep in mind, they only put single shot liquor in their drinks unless requested a double. Secondly, we tasted absolutely no alcohol and even with a single shot you can taste a little something. We tasted watered down Bloody Mary mix lol was completely disappointed.  Our server: Amanda was sweet. Towards the end, we shouldn't have to wait more than 20 minutes for our bill and was even more frustrated to see her just sitting down at a table talking with someone I'm guessing she knew right across from us. Get it together girlfriend. I'm sure working in Vegas is a hit or miss with tips but decent service can make a huge difference.   When it came to our bill, we kindly asked if it was possible to take my drink off since I barely drank mine and my boyfriend was a trooper and drank mostly his. She rudely said that problem doesn't go to her, it's all on the bartenders and she'll get the manager for us.... okay.  The manager came by (Austin, we THINK. Pretty tall dude with brown hair. I don't know, I probably heard his name wrong) ANYWHO, we kindly told him what the deal was and he suggested to put an extra shot because they can't comp off drinks for whatever reason. We declined the suggestion since I no longer wanted to continue drinking it regardless but we still had to pay. The bill ended up being $56.61.....   I personally and strongly don't recommend this place.",

This is my second time coming here and both times were above average. Much better than most diners. Love the breakfast, lunch and drink menu. Haven't had a change to get dessert yet. I recommend the sin city blt sandwich that is a blt with pesto and overeasy eggs. Like the tall coffee mugs over other places that usually have a standard little mug. And like the strawberry Pina colada.   Giant portions especially for breakfast. All egg breakfasts come with at least 3 eggs and the omelets look like 5 eggs. If you get the side order of cottage cheese, it's a lot. Around 2 cups. My dad couldn't finish an omelet, cottage cheese and a bagel, so I recommend coming here on a big empty stomach, share food or take food home.",

They are open 24-7 and offer a full menu (breakfast and dinner).  There's also a separate lounge area with a fireplace. it is equally as retro and gaudy as the restaurant.  The food portions are huge. chances are you will have left overs.  overall, I thought it was okay.  It is basically a glorified diner.  I wasn't impressed by the food or the drinks, but I can see why it's a Vegas tradition.  it was fun to visit once.  Personally, I would not go out of my way to come here again.

Who doesn't love indoor neon, old 70's dining table lamps, and rainbow sprinkles when eating?   The basics:  1. Affordable 24/7 diner with all-day breakfast 2. The menu is huge and overwhelming like Cheesecake Factory 3. While not fancy, this is just good, solid diner food done right. And big. 4. Happy Hour drink and app specials! Cocktail waitresses will take drink orders separate from servers 5. No split checks. Don't worry, someone invented Venmo for that.  Fun vibes and just a happy place to eat. Just a fantastic memory to add to any Vegas trip. Get the avocado BLT with the runny egg on top!",

The atmosphere is really cool and neon with plants and they play throwback 70-90's era music which is really cool! Love how this restaurant looks, only downfall was the vibes weren't so welcoming there. It wasn't bad, but it was just very dead as if no one wanted to be there- besides our cocktail waitress, (I don't remember her name unfortunately,) but she was the only one who seemed happy to be there, and just at least a little happy to speak to guests. aside from that the service was just very bland and dead. The cocktail waitress was the only one who even smiled at us. That's the reason why I rate this 4 stars, because everyone else seemed to hate being where they were lol. the food was really good though! I ordered a fettuccine with chicken, which comes with soup or salad. I chose soup with it and got the soup of the day- Tomato Basil. sooo good! my boyfriend ordered the buffalo bone in wings, and a hashbrown. (LOL). they serve breakfast/lunch/dinner 24/7! which is really cool. love the food! servings are huge, took more than half of my pasta to go! my boyfriend also ordered a house margarita. bill was only $50. not bad for 2 and big servings!",

Kim rolled her eyes after we told her we were waiting on another person. It set the tone for our meal.  The bus boys/runners were clearly annoyed with us, as well. One of them was Jeff, I believe. We asked for five of everything, but they only saw four people. I guess one more was too much to provide.  Thanks Elisha for being very attentive despite the commotion.

The portions are huge here, I recommend coming for breakfast food either in the morning or stumble in after the clubs to sober up. I've dined her for lunch multiple times and had their soup & half sandwich special.  Food Recommendations:  Anything breakfast! They all come with fresh toast and smothered in butter... so good.  Oatmeal (it's giant... i mean GIANT comes with all toppings on the size and decent priced) Caprese pesto sandwich is very generous with the fresh mozzarella slices.   FIRESIDE LOUNGE just to the left of the host booth is the entrance to lounge. It does have a dress code of no flip flop, no hats, no shorts i believe. It's a dark little hide away lounge with tons of trees and leaves between each of the large round booths, theres mirrors and neon lights  everywhere, and theres an awesome blue water/rock fire pit with a booth surrounding the whole area thats more of a community seating area for cocktails. They offer a smaller appetizer only menu and full drink menu.",

The restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. Ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate \"cocktail waitress\" to take our alcoholic drink order. One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. Needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. What a waste of money. As for the maitre d' I wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. So much for asking a local where to eat.",

    "text": "It was absolutely slammed when I went on a Sunday and we were seated fairly quick.  The decor is something out of Starlight Express with crazy neon across the entire restaurant.  The menu is overwhelming, not because it had too many choices, but because just by the wording on the menu you can tell you are about to be served an IMMENSE amount of food.  I have no doubt that if I had had a heavy night of drinking I would have probably appreciated this place a lot more, even though I found it quite good.  The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, \"Well this is all we got\" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.  I had the Eggs Benedict and he had the Ham and Eggs, note that every item on the menu comes with at LEAST 3 eggs.  Our food did take quite a while, but as I said, it was Sunday Brunch time and the place was packed with a line out the door.  When our food arrived it was hysterical.  My Benedict was enormous, 3 eggs spread across 2 english muffins, and the rest of my plate was covered in a thick delicious layer of hash browns,  Eggs were fluffy and light.  My partner, wow, if I could paint you a picture of how much food was on his plate...  Ok this slice of grilled ham was so large that the plate was literally layered with food instead of spaced across the plate.  The under layer, hashbrowns, above that a huge slice of ham even with the bone, and then the 3 eggs on top.  It was quite entertaining watching him attempt to eat what he could so he didn't feel like he was wasting food.  I will note that our waitress took a drink off our bill for the wait even though we never said a word and we were quite happy to enjoy each others company, so they are certainly not the kind of place that sees being busy as an excuse for not exceeding customer service.  Make sure you are hungry if you are headed here!  This is no place for snacking!",

I've never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I've been there over the past 15 years. It's amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff's cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that's about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.  I've almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don't know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can't finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I've had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than \"Sugar in the Raw.\")  The only other place in Vegas that I'd even consider recommending for breakfast in LV is the Grand Lux at the Venetian, but that's like being the second best golfer to Tiger Woods.   And I do admit I've never been in the lounge, but I hear it's awesome as well.",

This time, we were staying at the Riviera and it is right next door.  I told my husband we'd better make it there this time!  SO glad we did.  Tried the Scorpion drink - $18 but what the heck, two seperate drinks will cost ya that.  It is quite tasty.  The service was excellent and food pretty quick.  We about fell over when they brought out our dishes - they are HUGE.  Each of us could only eat half.  Should have gotten one and split it.  Hate to just throw all that out, so we boxed it to go, hoping to run into one of the many homeless hungry folks wondering around there to give it to.  Our bill was only $60 and that's with an $18 drink.  Not bad at all.  We went and sat by the fireplace in the lounge to finish off our scorpion before headin out to Fremont St. for the night.  Really wish we'd eaten here more often on our trip.  Bet the breakfasts are really good too.",

Imagine if Big lots sold a furniture line they called Gothic rainbow. Now imagine you're looking at it through purple shades and that's what the place looks like in daylight. They also have Tiffany style lamps with flamingos on them - someone should go to jail for that. Did I mention the ceiling is covered in black mirror tiles?  The large portions are no compensation for the underwhelming quality of the ingredients. Sour 1980s Gas station coffee, flavourless vegetables, and the cheese in my omelet resembled a generic version of a Kraft cheese slice.",

Cozy up on a red velvet couch and wait for a stripper to come sit on your lap, although if a girl does sit on your lap, it's probably not a stripper since the place only looks and feels like a boobie bar, but really isn't.

The portions at the Peppermill are your usual over-sized-Vegas-scale heaps and the quality is neither stellar nor unpalatable; this place is all about the atmosphere.  What a surreal experience.  This place is both trashy and elegant all at once and while the cocktail waitresses wear these wonderfully ironic evening gowns, the place is like a gussied-up diner.  Very Tarantino.  Finish your obscenely large meal (my \"side\" caesar and fettuccine alfredo could have easily fed 2.5 adults... not going to count how many day's calories went  down the hatch on that one), then mosey on into the Fireside for a cocktail in what feels like an early 1980s Central American druglords's den.  I loved it!  It felt like a strip club without the strippers.  The music got so loud at some point that no one sitting with me could actually communicate within a normal decibel range, but I'm pretty sure we were crashing a private party, so I guess I shouldn't complain.

I halfway expected to see strippers inside, sort of like the breakfast/brunch bars in Portland. (the building is lit with blue neon) Instead, we got a really cool restaurant where the servers were friendly, and moderately dressed, by Vegas standards at least. We were seated promptly, and within five minutes, our food orders were taken, our bar orders were fulfilled by a different waitress/bar girl, and our sodas and waters were refilled. I swear, I think we were helped by at least six different people, and usually at this time of night, most places are running on skeleton crews. I ordered the ribs, which were amazing, and my friends got the alfredo, corned beef meal and steak, all of which looked flippin delicious.

It's 24 hours so I hear it gets crazy later on but it was a Monday night when I was there, about 11pmish. We ordered ribs and a quesadilla, I had a Dreamcicle too which was DELICIOUS! i'm not a rib fan but HE is and he LOVED the ribs. I thought the quesadilla was pretty tastey even though it had issues staying together. Whatever.  This spot is super cooooooooooooool. Can't wait to go back!   P.S. They have regular and reverse HH daily.",

    "text": "This is as Vegas as it gets, folks. Nothing says Vegas like being greeted by a row of slot machines upon entering a diner with decor that looks like an indoor park threw up all over a casino. That might not make sense, but anyway, the food is awesome.  My cousin and I had one of those late nights and wanted some grub before heading home. She wanted breakfast food, and I wanted something with meat and fries and maybe some greens to make me feel like I'm eating \"healthy.\" Not a problem. Peppermill's menu has a good amount of tasty options.  Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap: I ordered this wrap which comes with the choice of either curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I chose curly fries because I can't remember a time when I went to a restaurant where that was an option. I think wraps can be hit or miss, but this was a hit.  I was really diggin' the combination of the spicy chicken and the mixed greens and house made ranch dressing. The curly fries were crunchy, greasy, and delicious.  The service is decent, though slow. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, but the wait is worth it considering how good the food is and the generous portions you receive.   Peppermill's location is on the sketchy side of The Strip, but the parking lot is well-lit and there is security that patrols the area.   The prices here are more than the typical 24-hour diner-style establishments, but it's worth it. Skip going to the Denny's that's just down the road if you want some good, late grubbin' after a long night.",

While waiting for 50 mins we drank some mimosas (tasty) :D doesn't disappoint. The french toast collage was good but nothing out of the norm. The swiss and mushroom burger was huge and it was quite juicy. The waitress we had was friendly and prompt. Theres a little jar that has colorful sugar crystals on the table. The bacon was so crunchy and it was good quality bacon lol. Not that cheap clear bacon. Eggs were ordered over well and they got it just right! Definitely a must try when visiting Vegas!

I had read somewhere that this place was quintessential Vegas...and they were not kidding. Bright lights, booths, fire pits, 80's music, mirrors...and fake flower arrangements...it had it all!! We were also surprised that they had 1/2 price beer specials...so we took advantage of that and ordered some chicken quesadillas which were ok...on a pinch. This place has two sections btw...one is restaurant and one is bar...I can't speak of the restaurant because we kept to the bar side the whole night.",

Food is actually really good better than Denny's or any other 24 hour restaurants I've been to recently. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is really fun, decorated like out of the 50s or 60s. Food portions are very generous and there's a wide variety of things to order from on the menu. This is a great alternative to going back in ordering room service at your hotel.  Price is fair compared to eating at a restaurant in one of the casinos.  Check this place out breakfast lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "We LOVE this place and don't know why we don't come here more often when we are in Vegas.  This review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.  THE RESTAURANT  Mirrors, fake Cherry Blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?  Service here is very good, prompt and friendly.  Proportions can be ridiculously large!  On the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and I didn't want to be too full... so I was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  I ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made Yukon Gold Potato chips.  The sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though I could not finish them.  My wife had the chicken pesto sandwich with onion rings, both of which she LOVED.  We returned a couple of days later for breakfast where I had the country fried steak and eggs which was good, though again I could not finish it (and I am a BIG eater) and she has the French Toast Ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  It was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!    I also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  I am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!  This place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  Proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.  THE LOUNGE  We freakin' LOVE this lounge!  Again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  I have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!  The waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  They prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their \"dress code\" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so I am not too what the boundaries of this \"code\" are.    They have a really cool menu advertising \"retro\" drinks like champagne cocktails, Manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   I ordered a Vodka Gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a Beautiful.  Both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.    Again this place can be pricy.  In fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at Treasures, a very high end strip club.  Money aside, I would find a reason to go to Vegas just to hang out at the Peppermill Fireside Lounge.  The ONLY reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.  Edit:  My wife's preferred drink this weekend was a Pina Colada.  She wanted me to point out that the Peppermill was the ONLY establishment that served her PC in a hurricane glass as it SHOULD be.  It may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details.",

I will say that when one goes into the restaurant, one gets that retro feeling, and the ambiance like that makes the experience great. It is quite packed all the time, but one does not have to wait that long.   It is a bit pricey, but it is worth the price since they do give great portions. Their regular order of a pancake is like three or four normal sized pancakes combined. It is HUGE. The food was great and I do recommend it for a great breakfast here.",

Maybe it was my choice in food, maybe it was the fact I was about to go get a tattoo, and that was on my mind, but either way, this place didn't WOW me.  Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.  The coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.  Basically, not sure if I will go back again- maybe to check out the fireside lounge, but for me it really didn't rock my world.",

Despite many trips to Vegas this was the first time I actually went in and had some food. I had forgotten there was also a location in Reno. It does always appear to be popular at all hours. I did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am. I enjoyed some very large bloody mary's but despite the size they don't particulary stand out. This is a nice benefit over the all night places like this where I live, but I guess that's just a matter of state law. I was pretty happy with my bruschetta though, which is something that is not often on menus. My boyfriend enjoyed his food too, which I can no longer recall what it was, but I remember there was enough left over for us to share with the homeless man outside. It was a lively atmosphere and I will probably try it out again in the future. Good service even in the early morning.",

Where else can you get traditional Corned Beef Hash with 3 poached eggs on top, a huge side of potatoes and a muffin for under $10.00.

Walking in, we saw a sign saying \"No hats allowed,\" and they mean it (another couple had to leave when the woman refused to take off her ball cap).  We sat on the comfortable couch by the fire. (Very nice!) and had our drink and food order taken quickly.  The food was OK but on the greasy side.  When it came to getting another round, the waitress was nowhere to be seen.  We flagged another one who indicated she would be right with us (she never came back), but it was near 15 minutes until someone was able to take our order.  Overall, a good place to relax, enjoy a drink, and to have a small bite.  The service issue won't dissuade me from coming back.",

This restaurant has a special kind of eighties vibe, with the neon, flamingos and cool seating. Our hostess couldn't crack a smile, but fortunatley she was the exeption of the evening. Our waitress Daisy was very friendly and patient, the menu had a wide selection of different kinds of food and the cocktails were reasonable priced. We ordered salads, steak, shrimps and burgers. All of the food was cooked perfectly and incredibly tasty. The portion were generous. On small thing bothered us, but apparently it's an european thing: once a plate was empty, it was taken away from the table even when other people were still eating. This is considered rude in western europe. All and all we enjoyed our evening very much and would definitly return if we would be in vegas!",

We came back the next day for some more drinks (it is Vegas afterall!) and some food. The Hawaiian Mimosas were amazing! Not sure if they were worth $10, considering you don't get much. After we got our drinks we waited for a table for about 30 minutes. Once we sat down we were greeted by our waitress, who started off very attentive and then soon disappeared until our check was delivered. I ordered the eggs benedict which were very mediocre.

    "text": "For what it is it fills a niche spot on the strip that also brings back nostalgic memories of the one at Serramonte in Daly City, CA.  When growing up in the late 70's, it was one of our go to spots for large portions of good comfort food, and busty, statuesque cocktail waitresses in flowing gowns.  Man, I remember the colored sugar in bottles on all the tables too...  There are no more Peppermills in the Bay Area, but this one still survives and is a throwback to that seventies diner.  Yes it's ghetto and cheesy, but think of Denny's, Carrow's, or Norm's but with big booth seating, neon lighting, and chrome accents and that's pretty much the way it was.  The colored sugar is gone, but the portion sizes are still decent.  I don't think I would come here to order steak or pasta, but standard diner fare is fine...  That said we had:  - The Peppermill Burger w/fries;<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=nS6W0CdWP3Wd7CR9WKqkQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a> - The Swiss & Mushroom Burger w/onion rings;<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=l2N9_HOlwejbZodafUdzKw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a> - The Reuben sandwich w/fruit cup;<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=c5ZgwLXL2S4FVSqU2Czkfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a> - Chicken Caesar Salad w/Rosemary Rustique bread;<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=pjr7B7xYy25-DWS1zRAr3Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=77R2zAj7PfGnm3vU4G7BJg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a>  The soup and salad comes with the Rosemary bread but only offered a tossed green or spinach salad, so for a little more, I added the soup of the day to my burger and gave it to my daughter so that she could have her soup and salad with a Chicken Caesar instead... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=ETvzWnTaDmgHQ2kk_cUx4w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_...</a>  The food is nothing spectacular, but the service was even and attentive, no problems throughout...  I once talked to the concierge at the Bellagio for dining recommendations, 'where do the locals go?'  I asked.  I think he oversold this place because he told me then that this was where all the strippers and showgirls went.  HAH!  Maybe that's why I always see hairy truck driver types in wife beaters hanging out.  Then again, it got me interested in coming here to give it a try.  Open 24 hours, I would come back for diner food, or dessert, or breakfast -- even though I've never seen any stripper or showgirl quality patrons, or even any leggy cocktail waitresses for that matter...",

    "text": "I LOVE THE PEPERMILL, truly it bears repeating; this is one of my favorite casual dining restaraunts in Las Vegas. Food wise you can expect all of the laid back dinner favorites (personal favorite is the reuben) and has a nice breakfast (24h) and lunch/dinner menu. Taste wise the food is very good, everything I have had is well seasoned, cooked, and is pleasing to the eye. The servings are very generous and could easily be made into a doggie bag for the following day. The pricing is reasonable for a dinner though the alcoholic cocktails are a bit on the high end. The decor is best described as delightfully tacky, something like Vegas meets Hawaii in the 80s. Its decorated in soft blues and purples with fake trees and neon, the waitresses dress in outfits that are straight out of a Jane Fonda 80s aerobic video, and the cocktail servers are all in black prom dresses. Truly what sounds like gaudy and overdone is actually quite tasteful. Finally the attached bar the Fireside Lounge is cozy and is a great place to grab a drink before dinner (or while you wait for a table) or for a nightcap at the end of your meal. The cocktails are a bit on the high side but the servings are generous and the drink well made. I highly reccomend the Pepermill to anyone living or visiting Vegas.",

The servings are big and satisfying. I loved my steak and eggs but couldnt finish them so I took it to go. The retro, old school Vegas theme is cool. I dont mind it. They were super busy during lunch but we didnt mind it as long as the drinks came coming in. The bathrooms were super clean and there was always someone there cleaning it. I would give it a 5 if it wasnt for our server.",

So this review is just for breakfast as they seem to be open 24 hours and have a fully separate bar area.  A short walk or drive from the Wynn with free parking, we got there before 9am and were seated right away, but then it started getting really busy as we were there.  They have an extensive menu and also have a cocktail waitress walking around for those that need a little \"hair of the dog\" in the AM.  The food was great and very generous portions, although probably a little more expensive than the Denny's down the street, but obviously nowhere near what it would cost to eat breakfast at the Wynn!  I would highly recommend if you are at this end of the Strip or have a car and looking for a good breakfast place on way downtown, etc.  Look forward to checking out the lounge on our next trip to Vegas!",

One thing about this restaurant, we had about 4 different servers come to our table. Kind of just confusing and unnecessary because we had to order drinks with one person, food with the other, then our server 'leaves' and gives us a new server even though i can still see her walking around serving people! And then yet another different waitress comes by to ask us for alcoholic beverages. TOO MANY SERVERS WE ONLY NEEDED ONE",

This place is opened 24/7 which is perfect for anytime of the day. We came in for breakfast after our B2V race and didn't have to wait too long for a table for the 6 of us.   The breakfast was decent. Everyone enjoyed their breakfast and mimosas. I got the corned beef which had to be canned. The corned beef was actually too salty. Overall the service was decent as well.   Good for breakfast or an American (Denny's type of meal).",

    "text": "We are locals so we frequent this establishment for family meals. The service here is usually slow because they tend to be busy. This evening, our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) went in and waited 15 minutes to be seated. Upon being seated, we waited a solid 15 minutes for someone...ANYONE to at least take our drink order. Finally, my husband got up and went to find someone to ask if we could at least get drinks. Another 20 minutes went by before we got our DRINKS.  When our order arrived at the table, only 2 of the 4 of us got meals. The other 2 sat and waited ANOTHER 15 minutes for their meals. No apology, no nothing.  Meanwhile, we have had to get up and find someone for ANYTHING we needed. We had tickets for a show so at this point, we had to get the bill and leave. My husband again left the table to go find the server and request the bill. The server handed him a FULL PRICE bill so my husband paid it just to get us out of there.  As we walked out, I stopped at the cashier's desk and began to tell her this was the worst meal we have ever had here. She gave me a blank stare and then stood there and eventually asked me \"do you want me to go get the manager\"?  Unfortunately we had no more time to spare to get to our show so I told her we don't have time to wait for a manager. That was it...she just stood there while we walked out. I guess they think their \"fame\" compensates for their lackluster service but it truly doesn't.  What a shame considering we are locals. It will be the last time we waste money at an establishment that doesn't care AT ALL about their service.",

Sourdough was so hard & rough the roof of my mouth is tore up. Fries were \"okay.\"  Overall, it was a very dry burger-not the greasy mess I was looking forward to. My friend ordered a med-rare steak & eggs & THAT came out well-done. We were too hungry to send our food back and ate what we could.   Our server was nice but never refilled our drinks let alone asked. Happy Hour is promoted on Facebook & their website, but NO menu. I had to pull it up online only to be told they didn't have the drinks listed.   It wasn't the amazing experience I am used to having here. I was soo excited to come here for my birthday and I regret doing so. Fortunately the day was great nonetheless.   And the \"free photo,\" isn't visible at all, just a gimmick to get you to buy one you can see.   After eating at Peppermill for years, between LV and the former Fresno location...I seriously doubt I will return.",

The fireside pit was definitely a place I feel I can get Day Drunk at. The fireside pit was separated from the main restaurant. If you installed a few poles and threw in some strippers, it will look EXACTLY like a strip club. It's dark and the seats were definitely strip club-esque.   Anyhow, we ordered this fishbowl drink (supposedly their signature drink) that we saw being served at another table while waiting for our table at the fireside pit. It was about 18 dollars and enough for 2 people to share because it was huge. It was also quite a tasty drink. Thumbs up.  We also split an omelet, which came with a side of hash browns. Both were decent. Nothing particularly good or bad to say here.   The reason I'm such a fan is the fact that it's open 24 hours, the old school Vegas feel, and a photographer even came by to take our picture and print out a free postcard for us!",

Not only is it far enough north on the Strip to give you that old Vegas feel, it still has the look and feel of the old school, flashy for the sake of being flashy, design to it.  The real reason make the Peppermill a stop on your Vegas Vacation is for the food.  Not just pancakes and eggs and toast kind of place.  They serve breakfast all day and the portions are truly ridiculous.  The staff here is super friendly and they are always willing to work with you on the menu if you want to be a little bit creative.  On my last visit, I couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch.  I asked the server if I could combine the two and build a lamb gyro omelet.  The end result was a massive 10 egg omelet filled with lamb meat and feta cheese all smothered in  dill tzatziki sauce.  If you like Greek dishes, then give it a try.    Incidentally, in the parking lot there was a brand new Lamborghini being delivered by West Coast Customs.  This place is hysterical, in the \"we're laughing with you\" kind of way.",

All the waitstaff are dressed up in some way.  The cocktail waitresses have these shmexy long gowns, the waitresses have short skirts and suspenders, and the waiters have a male version of the suspenders.  They show less skin, though. Too bad.   This place is known not only for its Vegas-y vibes, but also for its large portions!  Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long.   Additional bonus: our server was so nice to separate all the orders onto separate checks despite the fact that we presented her with a 20-person group. Winning!",

Period.  Went for breakfast but they serve their whole menu all day. Greeted right away by friendly host. Sat and served coffee immediately.  Cocktail waitress frequented a couple times to make sure we didn't want anything. Friendly not pushy. Waitress was friendly and very attentive. Filled drinks right away.  Noticed without asking that we were out of regular sugar packs. My eggs were waaay over runny and I had to send them back.  She was very apologetic.  The manager brought my eggs back perfect and also apologized.  She said she personally sent them back twice for me because they cooks didn't get them right to get liking. Wow. Judy wow. That is personal attention. Speaking of food,  our was great.  My meal was super simple (eggs, sausage & hash browns). Was good.  Hash browns are ribbon style and fresh. But my hubby ordered chicken fried steak. It was really, really good! Huge and cooked perfectly.  Not chewy. Yummy gravy that tasted like sausage. The portions are enormous!  Easily shareable. 3 eggs come with most dishes. Can't wait to come again! They have an awesome team!",

They have a restaurant side and a lounge side. The lounge has fire Pitt and comfortable low lit seating. The perfect spot to come eat after a night of clubbing. If your hungry or u just wanna hang out and drink.  If your ever in vegas u have to try it.",

The portions are huuuuuge and extremely tasty, and they give you yummy garlic bread while you wait. The portions are serious, and you could easily split a dish, and have an appetizer or salad.  The desserts are to die for, but who has room? I also thought it seemed quite a bit more expensive than it used to, which was a bummer. We were sat in a corner, and had the pleasure of hearing.every.single.word of a very loud girl on her first date with a real charmer (not really). We heard of her arrest, how she teaches little kids, that she has a DUI, and that he has a gaggle of children with an array of women. The point is, some of the seating is a little close for comfort. The fire pit lounge is a life altering event as well, so do try it out while you are there. Never change Peppermill!",

We arrived after midnight and this was actually our first stop out in Vegas. We ordered a few drinks and appetizers. I had the shrimp cocktail which was really fresh and good with nice plump chilled shrimp. My husband ordered beer battered cheese sticks. They were crisp and fresh served with a side of marinara sauce.    I ordered the Key Lime pie martini, complete with a graham cracker rim. It was creamy, sweet and strong. Loved it! My husband had a huge Mai Tai and I actually laughed at him when it came out because it was a giant girly drink. It was also very strong and good.   I wish we could have ordered some of the breakfast items but I wasn't too hungry. I really loved the atmosphere and the very 80's vibe they have going on in here. Such a fun place to dine and have drinks. Our waiter Jose was very attentive and nice. Our cocktail waitress was also very patient as we were taking forever to decided on what to order. We were given plenty of space to enjoy ourselves and just enough service to fulfill our needs.",

When you walk in you think you have turned back the hands of time and entered the 80's and ended up in Reno, NV. The decor is loud and in your face. The booths are big, black, and super shiny with bright pink lighting all throughout! I swear this place was used during the filming of some 80's mob movies- but I could be wrong!  Food wise this place is just great if you want huge portions, grease to soak up the alcohol, and prices that you probably wont find in any of the big hotels.

The breakfast food is Denny's with a Vegas twist. The twist comes from the funky mirrored/neon interior and the short skirted waitresses. The food was more expensive than the breakfast buffet at the hotel next door, but the staff was friendlier and the food significantly better. If you are not staying in the northern end of the Strip it is not worth the effort to go out of your way for the Peppermill. If you happen to have the 'good' fortune to stay at the Riviera, plunk you food dollars at the Peppermill.",

    "text": "Well worth it!  When we called to make reservations for our large group (10+) for lunch on Father's Day the receptionist let us know that even though they Didn't do reservations, you could still call ahead and get put on the waiting list before you arrived.  The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we called ahead about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.  However, this wasn't wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.  What to choose?  After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things: 1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak  The Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of \"A Christmas Story.\" All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was \"You're gonna poke your eye out!\" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.  Good sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn't taste the alcohol.  P.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion's cup (Known as a \"Fishbowl\") as a memento for an additional five dollars.  Time to do some eating!  Portions were very large. Great for sharing.  The Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your \"crave\" list. 5/5  The over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4/5  The hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2/5  The \"Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!\" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4/5 and also their Pancakes 4/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn't so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.  Kind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.  This is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.  Sincerely, Michael",

Nothing wrong with that, if that's what one is looking for.  Well, it seems it is the place to be for the lounge, not the restaurant part.  We did not go back to see what the lounge had to offer.  But if you are only going for the food, that's not what the rave is all about.  The staff was very nice and everything looked cleaned to me.  Next time we will go for the lounge experience , get drunk then tell you how it went.",

We had 2 sandwiches and both were huge portions (if anyone knows me, they know if I say they are huge...they are) and delicious.  we had a hot pastrami sandwich and a french dip with straight horseradish.  Home made onion rings and a delicious red potato salad completed the meal....wasn't exactly ready for a 5 hour drive after we finished...a nap would have been preferred...but i was due at work in 6 hours haha  Service was friendly and efficient refilling my coffee about a zillion times in preparation for the drive",

Turned out it was close by and we walked over from the Hilton Resort. Turned out this place is like a Denny's but with tripple the price tag and the portions larger. We all ordered breakfast and I would say we all enjoyed our breakfast. The place had a few roudy people but it was a good place to hang-out. The only thing that I would recommend is to be able to move the table out a little because I felt I was in a tight booth.    As we left the place I wanted to check out the pool of fire but that was in another section and it was cozy in there but there was way too much smoke in there.  maybe next time were in the hood we'll check out the lounge area and hang.",

    "text": "Usually a 24 hour restaurant, I usually think of Denny's. Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny's. Then I would be coming there all the time.   Located next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter \"C\", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe.   The staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay.   Looking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don't mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn't. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left.   If your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant.",

We had a very large group (20+) and the servers were patient with all of us. Ordered the Country Fried Steak breakfast. Portions were huge. I got a generous helping of hash browns along with egg whites. Two huge pieces of country fried steak with sausage gravy all over. The sausage gravy actually had a generous amount of sausage pieces in it. Drinks here are made strong and do not disappoint.   The look and feel of the place just screams cheesy. Reminds you of the days of old Vegas with the neon everywhere. It is nice to see that not everything has changed.   If you are not in the mood for a buffet or a high end restaurant, this is the place to go. Me and my friends came here before a night of debauchery but you could also go here to recover as well.",

Other than that, this is a great place to go to if you want to get away from all the clubs and strip bars on the strip. It's very relaxing - comfy & large couches, chill music, and good drinks.

Drinks are not the cheapest here but you are paying for the fun decor etc. I will be visiting this place again... they don't allow hats to be worn but besides that the dress code seems basic.

A little on the expensive side but it was worth it. Separate servers for cocktails and food.  Place was packed at 10. Breakfast served all hours. We waited in the lounge for our name to be called and had a mimosa, which came in a huge glass with ice, more like a mimosa cocktail. It was really good! Wait for 2 was only about 15min.  Had the ambrosia french toast. These photos don't do it justice. The plate was huge! Served with sour or whipped cream, both of which were very good. I wasonly able to eat half along with my side of eggs. My bf ordered a standard meal and asked for the bacon extra crispy but it came out almost undercooked...just the way I like it. He had another special request which was taken down but didn't happen but he was in love with their toast so that made it all better.",

Service is always exceptional and we rested and planned our day with the buz of happy vegas vistors telling their stories of woes and greatness...I LOVE THIS PLACE!!",

Maybe it's sad when you have to consult Yelp to figure out what you did about 3 years ago, but I did.  This time, we were here with the kids, and we had a fantastic night - maybe the best night of our whole trip, because after feeding Thing 1 and Thing 2 a massive burger / pancake / french toast / whatever the hell they ate they insisted on having a dessert.   \" Too much food \" we said \" you'll never finish it \"  \"OH YES WE WILL\"  \"Wanna bet?\" Oh yeah baby.  The largest banana splits I have ever seen in my life arrived - they must have had 5lbs of ice cream and four bananas apiece on them, there was no way the boys are going to finish them. They approached their task with grim determination. After a few minutes it was clear they were not enjoying themselves - this was work.  \" you're not allowed to stop - you have to finish them \"  \" what sort of parents are you guys that you are making us eat this -this is force feeding, this is torture - you guys are completely irresponsible\"  Jesus, I laughed so much. It was fantastic. Great service, great food, great value - and they had a Fog Cutter on the menu - it was a bit sweet, but it was decent enough.",

My wife, had mentioned this is one of her favorite places because of the rainbow sugar.  I figured might as well try out a new place...so i took her word for it and came in for a bite.  Once inside, it looks even more like a strip joint than it did outside.  We walked in through the lounge area in the back...it's very dark, more Neon Purple and Pink lighting, that thick black carpeting and mirrored ceiling. Once through the lounge and into the restaurant, there was more lighting though the strip joint ambiance looks like it mated with a family friendly restaurant and gave birth to what is Peppermill.  Our orders were taken, and our meals were served with in a few short minutes.  The food portions where pretty gnarly (at lest for what we got) and I definitely well worth it's price.  I look forward to my next dining experience here.",

Also, if you want to get drinks before you start your meal you can just hop over to their bar area which has a wicked cool firepit and you chill around the fire with your friends.   Food here is pretty tasty and the portions are HUGE! (Which is great for sharing) I had the Reuben sandwich with fries and it was really good. If you want comfort food, this place has a bunch of it.

Open 24hrs is ideal for soaking up the booze consumed on the strip. Lounge area continues the vibe with a center piece fire on the water. Cocktails are good - bartenders didn't mind the few suggestive tweaks I asked for. Staff was friendly, accommodating, and quite easy on the eyes. Good spot for a solid meal and funky ambiance.",

Good size portions are served, but the food were just whatever. I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger and my friends all had various burgers and breakfast entrees and nothing stood out in terms of flavoring. Not worth the low double digit price tags for each. Guess the good thing is that they are open 24. For about the same price, Hash House A Go Go is a way better choice for even ridiculously huger portions and yummier tasting food with more of a distinctiveness.",

It's down the strip near the Riviera Casino.   We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly.   Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here.   There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.    Don't forget to break out your leisure suit!",

In any case, Monstrous Bloody Mary's for $8.50, corned beef hash, poached eggs, and some crab cakes Benedict hit the spot after an early flight from the Windy City. Prices were inflated, but WTF, it's the Strip. Service was friendly enough considering the packed house and slowed food output.

I don't mean any of this in a bad way -- the food was decent, if not exceptional.  And despite the 24-hour drink menu and all, there were plenty of families with kids, it was fine for that.",

The mozzarella sticks are literally the best I've ever had and loved their onion rings. Have had a better Philly cheesesteak but the sandwich here wasn't the worst I've had. The service was great, friendly, and quick! The decor is so retro diner and very fun to be in! It's a little pricey for the diner type foods, but what do you expect? It's Vegas!",

The food in general is no better than any other fast casual breakfast place just bigger portions. Our server, Cheyanne, we think forgot our order because when she started serving people around us, who sat down 45 minutes after our party of 6, she said the delay was \"making a grilled cheese\". Funny, the grilled cheese came out first! She also brought toast to one diner 30 minutes before their eggs arrived. When they asked for \"hot toast\" for their meal she seemed a little put out. BUT, the Peppermill is an establishment and part of the Vegas experience. Just don't think you are going to get anything special except for your Bloody Mary served by a woman in an evening gown.",

Country Fried Steak and Mash - his plate looked like a frozen dinner - I didn't even ask for a bite.  He didn't seem too enthused either but he ate about half.   I couldn't find anything on the menu worth trying so I got 2 things that most places cant get wrong...Mozzarella sticks and wings. Well the mozzarella cheese was super thick and hard to chew and the buffalo wings had long feathers  they missed pulling were soaked in buffalo sauce... I ate 1 stick and 2 wings.

    "text": "We decided to pop into The Peppermill for dinner after having cocktails at one of our favorite lounges at The Cosmo. At any rate, I was primed and ready for a hearty, big-portioned meal. The Peppermill apparently has notoriety for that. I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint.  We were enticed by the Chicken Nachos as an appetizer. Little did we know that the Chicken Nachos would actually end up as our appetizer AND dinner. The serving size was enormous. Huge! Slathered in a variety of melted cheeses and topped with all the usual suspects, it was amazing. What I loved about it was that all the accouterments were served on the side: a bowl of re-fried beans and more melted cheese, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. It's nice to be able to have control over the toppings.  Heaven! Bliss! After we were done with the nachos we knew we couldn't even consider ordering a dinner entree.   I'm a little disappointed because I really was excited about trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. It'll have to wait until another trip, sadly.   We also ordered margaritas. Honestly, they seemed watered down. But we are from San Diego and have very high standards for our margaritas. As such, I'll give them a pass for that.   The Peppermill appears to have an eclectic demographic, consisting primarily of locals (at least at dinner hour). Our cab driver confirmed that. The douchebags don't typically venture that far down the strip, from what I've learned.   I would highly recommend this place. If you're a foodie like me, you will leave in a happy food coma. Make reservations in advance to avoid a wait. I'm glad I did.",

But the good news is that the Peppermill is still here, still standing and still going strong as it has been since (GASP!) the Seventies! From our first visit there to our most recent, THIS is where we bring out-of-town friends and family, who want to experience some of that \"back-in-the-day Vegas kitsch.\"  Best explanation I've heard given to describe this place is that \"it's like having dinner inside of a giant disco glitter ball\", and for the most part, that is fairly accurate. The purple-and-pink neon, the shimmery walls, and the over-the-top bar/lounge is one place you've got to see to believe!  The food isn't terrible, but not as great as the ambiance.  And the menu is HUUUUGE, much like many of the portions. I'd be shocked if anyone could go through that WAR AND PEACE-sized list and declare, \"I can't find anything I like.\" Be prepared NOT to hear that, but know that if you're not into Texas-sized servings, you WILL be taking home a doggie bag.   When you ride The Deuce, the city bus that carries everyone back and forth around the Strip, Peppermill is considered to be one of the main stops.  One visit, and you'll know why.  Here's to another dozen decades or so for this one-of-a-kind eatery.",

Some think \"Strip Club\" I thought \"Disco!\". Sooooooooo, I scrolled all the hot YELP reviewed sites and saw my fav girl Bobbi's review on this place called THE Peppermill.   So, naturally,  after reading about this place from a Yelper whose reviews I trust, find very humorous, not to mention a girl I absolutely adore from 3,000 miles away, I HAD to come here when I was in Vegas.   Walking in, you're greeted with the blue and purple neon strip club lights. The music is on all the TV's. Classic Rock, some pop scattered here and there and when I entered GNR was playing on the TV's.  Okay. Peppermill, Ya had me at GNR.  So, breakfast was ordered as I sat staring at a little water pond with a fire place in the middle.  It was a step down kind of pit, and it was so oooooo relaxing I soon almost nodded off.   Breakfast was fast and huge!  It's like IHOP on steroids. I have always loved little cheese places like this to people watch and you definitely get some characters in The Peppermill at 330-5am. .... I can't help it, I love to observe cheesy places (The Cats in the Fiddle in Hollywood, The Rainbow in Hollywood, The STANDARD just about anywhere) and am often not diapointed by Good Times and cheesy fun!

Oh what to do?!!?  Yep, open up Yelp and let my taste buds do the walking.    The closest place that wasn't fancy or didn't require a reservation was The Peppermill.  As we walked past the place (had to get to a crosswalk) it looked like a fun place to have dinner and the rest of you Yelpers had it at 4-stars...so we gave them a shot.  From the outside, the place didn't look like much more than a fancy NJ Diner...just with more neon.  When we got inside I realized the place was bigger than it seemed, but it STILL looked like a neon bathed NJ diner...so I was hoping for a good meal at a good price.  The menu here is pretty large, but we were here for a couple of steaks...nothing too fancy, but something that would sit in my stomach for the 5+ hour flight home (what were we thinking?).  Ernesto came over and took our drink orders and was back quickly for the food orders.  We skipped the appetizers (though the meal did come with salad) and we ordered a couple of NY Strips...my buddy added a side of fettuccini alfredo and I stuck with my potato...and we both also got a side of cooked, marinated mushrooms.  We waited a bit for Ernesto to come back with our salads and I asked him 2x for water.  When the salads arrived a waitress named Gabby delivered them and I asked for more water (this time it took about 45 seconds).  Ok, I know what you're thinking...these idiots ordered steaks at what amounts to a fancy diner?!?!  Yep...don't judge a book by its cover.  My steak, though a little small, was actually quite delicious.  Cooked with just some salt and cracked pepper it was tasty and done just medium.  My co-worker had to send his back as his was still mooing, but it came back quickly and was more to his liking.  For some reason, Ernesto disappeared and we ended up with Gabby as our waitress.  Now, I'm not one to judge, but this being Vegas and all, I don't think this was the only job Gabby had...Gabby was very friendly, quite a beautiful young woman, and honestly a great waitress.  I hope she ended up taking the tip instead of Ernesto who did nothing more than take our order.  Gonna give The Peppermill 3.5 stars and have to round down.  The undercooked steak, the disappearing waiter, the multiple requests for water...the service could have been better (though it got better with Gabby).",

I love the old school vibe of the Fireside lounge, it is not a pounding music blaring nightclub, its a place to hang out enjoy a drink in a comfy booth and still have a conversation or cuddle!  Hubby and I enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer platter was way more food then we could eat as a midnight snack!  Loved the Watatini (watermelon martini) very yummy! can't wait to go back and try all the rest!  Yes for the 20 something set it may seem old or not the \"in\" thing but we think its a great place for a date or a nice evening with your sweetie!",

Also trying to save a bit of money, and my first day in Vegas, this place was a bit pricey for breakfast if you're A) not hungry and B) not looking to spend a lot of dough.   They took our photo and gave us this \"Oh so cute\" little postcard of the folks at our table, trying to sell us the bigger picture for Oh, I dont' know. Fifteen bucks, maybe? Something ridiculous.   The Peppermill itself was pretty awesome. It was all pink and puple and yeah, disco, very colorful. The waitresses were wearing lollipopish apron type things. The hostesses were wearing these hot little dresses that might have matched the carpet in some of the more dingy, older hotels (Riviera, Circus Circus, etc), but they somehow made it look hot.   The food was in heaping portions. I actually ended up splitting mine with a friend. We got some sort of Mexincan-styled omelette, rye toast, potatoes, etc. We didn't even finish our meal.   It was pretty awesome, and I'll go back sometime when I'm feeling better- And when I feel better about spending the money- Maybe when I have a bigger appetite! It definitely seemed like a novelty.",

She didn't even greet us or nothing and as she walked us to the table she was talking to another customer instead of asking us how we were or anything...very unprofessional.  On the other hand our server was great, very sweet and caring but this stupid camera guy came up to us and just stood here didn't say a word then says \"would you guys like a picture, it's free\" we took pictures I bought 2 and he was just so weird and awkward I felt so uncomfortable then this kid says that his feet hurt...I told him he has an easy job and he should be fine. I don't think anyone should complain about an easy ass job like come on. My burger wasn't even that good, my boyfriend got steak worth $30 he asked for medium rare and it was over cooked...we left and of course left. Good tip as always but this restaurant seems like the managers don't know how to run it we left and no one said goodbye. Food is extremely expensive for shitty food and horrible customer service. I would never come back...also my boyfriend got extremely sick because the food was bad. Worst experience ever.",

When the food came 5 minutes after that, and was sent back 3 times, she had nothing to say about that. When I went to go pay and the cashire asked about the food I told him it was horrible and he laughed then the waitress next to him said, \"ya we've been having issues with that for a while now.\" 2) Food was tragic. cold, tastless, and off.  3) the lounge was very random.  the drinks were weak, service slow, and I never got the money I cashed out!

The drinks are well made and the food (I had the chicken quesadillas on my recent visit.) is  really good.  The fire pit at Fireside is pretty cool as are the comfy, curved bench/couch seating (with pillows).  It's a place you can really kick back and enjoy your evening.  You can just kick back relax, chill, and bask in the neon glow that is Fireside.  It is certainly a favorite stand-by to drop in every time I come into town now.",

    "text": "Imagine partying and being out all night in \"The Vegas,\" fueled up on adrenaline, eight shots of Gray Goose, six Red Bulls, four lines of nose candy, and maybe two hits off of a gravity bong. In other words, you're freakin' wasted.   Your world is starting to spin and you need some food to keep functioning (and to ensure you don't puke or OD). You stumble into a Denny's and you are blown away by weird neon colors, friendly service, and good food at great prices featuring out of this world portions. You are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.  Well, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the Peppermill, except that I was not on a Charlie Sheen style bender. Even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, I was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.  After a long day of traveling and working, I came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that Snookie would salivate over. With my entree, I was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. I opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. And when I say side, I mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.  It was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. But of course, being a nasty pig, I devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a I could until I felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose.   I was so impressed by the meal and the service, I let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that I would be back the following day. As I wasn't pulling a Charlie Sheen, the next day I kept my word and returned with my coworker. Word is bond, yo.  This time around, I had a chicken focaccia sandwich filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of Balsamic vinaigrette. The sandwich was delicious. This time around I opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. Whatever. I like being fat. No, really. I swear.  In the end, this has become one of my new favorite places to eat in \"The Vegas,\" even if the food makes my face look young (greasy and pimply) and body look old (round and fat). Good food and good times, even without a Charlie Sheen recipe for disaster.",

Being just north of the now main drag of Las Vegas Boulevard, its definitley within striking distance and easy to get to.  Most dishes here are under $15 and the portion size are good.  The fact that its open 24 hours immediately made this place one of my favorite places on the strip.  I got the sampler which is quite similar to the Denny's sampler but tasty!  Chicken strips, mozzarella sticks, onion rings....yup, its a diet nightmare.  The onion rings were quite notable.  The crowd is also a mixed bag of locals, tourists and vegas characters.

There's the famous fire pit that you see in pictures but there's only one with about 6 2-person sofas. The fire pit has TVs all around it that play sports and awesome 90s music videos. There are honey roasted peanuts, matches, an a clean ashtray at every sofa.Their happy hour has decent drink and appetizer deals. My friend and I got the cheese plate for $8 during happy hour. The plate came with a ton of swiss and cheddar cheese, grapes, pears, strawberries, candied walnuts, and crackers; really filling. The margaritas were $6 and the Jack and cokes were $5 during happy hour.",

The food was delicious and the plates are full when they arrive! the salads have no icky greens and the dressing is tasty. We will come again",

The service has dropped, the food is not as good, and the prices have increased so that it's no longer a good value to leave my hotel. $7.90 for 2 coffees (not even Starbucks charges this). $17 for a turkey club sandwich with a sliver of avocado. Breakfast for 2 was $45 (no alcohol was ordered). When we mentioned our concerns to the manager, it was clear that she could have cared less. I've been coming since I was 14 yrs old. Guess what - I ain't comin' back until this ship turns around. What a shame; It used to be a cool local place and now it's just another tourist trap.",

Open 24 Hours Large portions of food for small prices Slot machines A bar Drunk people at 3am Crowded Always dark in here  Drunk people at 3pm  What more could you ask for?  Vegas may have grown and evolved but this place stays the same. I have eaten here many times over the years. Recently I stopped in for breakfast and met Mary the night manager. I could not believe how nice she was considering all of the crazy drunk people she has to deal with during those hours.   I stopped in to grab a carry out menu but they were out of them. Mary grabbed me a real menu and a pencil and paper so I could write down my order for the next day. I told you she was nice.  I called the next morning to place my order and Mary remembered me. I did a veggie omlette but I went all Sally from \"Harry met Sally\" on them. I went egg whites, no salt, no mushrooms and substituted to Swiss cheese.  Yeah I was that pain in the butt special order guy. I even asked for crispy hash browns. Mary took my order on the phone and even read it all back to me. She also told me my food would be ready in 10 minutes.   I was finishing my run and headed over to grab my food. I was amazed at how fast I was able to get my food. Mary even went out of her way to get my hash browns really crispy. I saw her giving a little shout towards the cook. You go Mary!  My food was really hot and there was tons of it. I actually couldn't eat it all and saved half of it in my hotel fridge. Hey it's a desert out here, so food hoarding is acceptable here!  Everything was great. The hash browns were really rich.  I think they were cooked in butter. Mmmm...butter!!! I did have to use a few napkins to soak up the oil spill. The omlette was cooked perfectly but again it was huge. Big enough for two people to share. So keep that in mind when you eat here!  If your looking for an old school Vegas food place, then this is it. There is nothing left like it on the strip. So enjoy this place while it lasts because before you know it Trump or Wynn are gonna drop a Casino on top of it!",

With so many reviews, there is not much I can add, except that the stars are more for the AMBIANCE AND EXPERIENCE than for the food.  I had the Chicken Parm - double heaping helpings of breaded chix, basic pasta, and passable marinara.  Overall, this is middling Italian-American fare with BREAKFAST OPTIONS and many HANGOVER CURES at GOOD PRICES.    CUT TO THE CHASE:  On my last two visits to Vegas, I did not make it a point to go back.  But I did not deliberately avoid it either.  It's just not my thing.",

Then I remembered as a kid, I went to Peppermill with my family during those late nights of working late, class or otherwise. I decided to take him and the spawn here.   We were greeted by a hostess in a rainbow patterned shirt. She was seating other guests so the cashier came up and sat us immediately. As we sat down, a man in an orange Polo (so many different uniforms) brought us water and asked for our drink order. I settled on an orange juice and the babe just had his water. We had Kaitlyn as our waitress. She was really kind, asked about our baby, and took our order.   WHAT WE HAD:  Crab cakes Buiscits and gravy  The crab cakes came in orders of three, topped with diced tomatoes and green onions. They came with a roasted tomato sauce. Both of us loved it! The biscuits and gravy were good as well. Wish they came out a little hotter, and personally I've had better elsewhere in the valley. My daughter loved them though.   HIGHLIGHTS  Retro decor Rainbow sugar (they had red white and blue for the holidays) There were different uniforms for the hostess, cashier, manager, bussboy, waitress and lounge service. Try to spot them all!  Overall a good experience, I'll come back for another late night bite!",

My fault for not reading the description, I thought it was a pasta dish. The shrimp were well cooked, but I've had better scampi sauce. It came with what appeared to be instant rice and some veggies. Again, it was ok, but not a $25 plate of food. Definitely stick to the appetizers and bar foods. Try the potato wedges--those were really good with the bacon bits in the middle smothered in cheese!",

    "text": "Quite a disappointing experience.  I went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the Rock in Rio festival. One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.  The ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.  Our female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.  A different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down.   - Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce  - Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual - Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalapenos, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream.  -  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?  We were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.  Needles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights.",

The Peppermill is precisely what it ought to be as a classic diner - giant menu, stainless steel exterior, breakfast all day. But it also has a full bar, a photographer and a clientele that is clearly a mix of locals, people starting their day, and people ending their day.  I tried the gyro (excellent), the onion rings (excellent) and an omelette (also excellent). They play the favorites and do them well. I strongly recommend a visit. You will have more fun there than any buffet on the Strip.",

My husband loves everything retro. I came across the Fireside Lounge while researching places to go on our Vegas trip, and knew immediately that this would be right up his alley.  I was right. The velour couches, neon lights, and servers dressed in long gowns definitely made us feel like we were in a time warp. Well, except for the fact that bad 90s country music was playing. I mean, if you're going to go with a theme, you need to go all in!  Service was a little odd. We waited a few minutes for the server in our section to greet us. Then another woman came by and was like \"hey, so and so is supposed to be your server, but I may wind up being your server, so we'll see.\" Then after bringing our drinks, she said \"yeah so and so is supposed to be your server, but she's busy, so I'll be taking care of you.\" I mean, okay, I guess?  I ordered a Kiss Me Cucumber, which was delicious, but super weak alcohol-wise. Even after a second one, I felt nothing. My husband had two double jack and cokes and definitely felt it a bit. We also ordered sririacha chicken bites to snack on, which were pretty tasty - crispy and a little spicy.  When we were ready to go, it took forever to get our check. It was 1am on a Tuesday, so it wasn't very packed. Not sure why that took so long.  Overall, three stars. We'll come back next time we're in town and see if this changes.",

This place may be iconic Vegas dining, and the movie \"Casino\" might have been filmed there, but I am not ever coming back. After a meal of average quality, a 2\" roach crawled up on the table right after we paid the bill.  GROSS.  As we lunged for it, it flew and landed on the seat back of the neighbor's booth. (I have a photo of it.)  We pointed it out to our neighbors, and as they tried to kill it, if flew and landed right on their appetizer.  DOUBLE GROSS.  They immediately got up and left - good for them.  We reported to the manager who duly claimed they exterminate on a regular basis.  We were 60-70' from the kitchen, and a farther distance from the exit.    To be fair, the customer service was good but not excellent.  The wait staff was sufficiently attentive but team execution was off.  They served a weak drink, and an undercooked (vary rare) hamburger that was ordered medium well.  Both were fixed, but they still charged us for the bad drink.",

The offer almost everything you could be craving at the middle of the night. The best part is, the portions ARE HUGE especially for the price. I ordered the Yogurt Parfait and WOW it could have probably served 5 people. It reminded me a lot of McDonald's parfait but with much much better quality fruits and granola. Other notable dishes: Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap (the curly fries with it is AMAZING), Joe's San Francisco Special, and Tostada Omelet.   The service was not bad! For the most part, everything was what you would expect from a diner so I'm perfectly pleased. Definitely will be back to check out their Fireside Lounge though!!",

Coffee shops in the casinos are the same price, even less...  It does glimmer in that old-world tacky sorta 70's Vegas flare, as contrived as it is, with lots of neon and psychadelic colors.  Sorta fun to see, once.  I miss the old coffee shop in the Mirage.  They closed it in 08, I think.  We tried the TI coffee shop, NOT the same thing.  Planning to try the new one in Aria, next week.  Maybe it can measure up the the Mirage.",

And I guess I still do, but I was really bummed when I ordered a $9.50 margarita and got what tasted like a leftover margarita.  You know like when you make a margarita and have some leftover in the shaker and all the ice melts and then you drink it sometimes against your better judgement...oh sorry.  Yeah, I know what a bad margarita tastes like and I know at almost  $10 a pop that shit better taste good.  So I was really pissed when the server wouldn't take the drink back.  She said that's why they suggest the 50 cent upgrade when they take your order.  I'm sorry, shouldn't a $9 margarita taste pretty good to begin with?  I asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said YES!!!  At this point,(when i thought I wouldn't be getting my money back) I said sure throw some more tequila(and possible spit from the bartender) on my shitty drink.  The drink comes back and Quel Surprise! still shit!  Fuming inside, i thought I'd try my luck with the manager.  She explained that it is their policy not to return drinks and that's how it is at most places on the strip, but she was kind enough(and seeing that i had barely touched the drink) to take the drink off the bill.  I don't want to write off the Peppermill because it is fun and kitschy.  I just know that i won't order  a margarita there.",

The waitress came over quickly with water and the menu and the woman who delivers drinks (holy cow!) came over to ask if I wanted anything from the bar. No draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of Corona. As I watched the dishes passed over from the chefs I couldn't believe how large the portions were. I ordered the Reuben and potato salad and couldn't finish it all. The sandwhich was very good and the potato sald was (not as good as Mom's) but decent. I would def go back there again.",

Typical diner food on a large portion scale with their signature dishes including such (somewhat healthy) items like their western fruit plate which is about two pounds of assorted fruit with a nice loaf of banana bread which is served with marshmellow butter/sauce! YUM! their bloody maria's are excellent and if you'd rather hang by the fire they have a lounge attached that has TV's and sunken living room seating with a fire pit. The interior of the entire facility is adorned with mirrors, obnoxious neon lighting and fake trees and plants! Devine old Vegas style! The Peppermill should also win your love because unlike most of our city that has changed, died or evolved over time the Peppermill has stood strong as a staple here in Vegas for many, many, many years! A final FYI: It's also an excellent place to people watch at 3am",

I got a burger, despite it being a huge, overcooked hockey puck with a stale bun, I BURNED THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH ON THE FIRST BITE.  They must have left the burger under the heat lamp or placed it in the microwave.  I told the manager and she said that I was like someone who takes a big gulp of hot coffee and blames the coffee shop!  In my 40 years, I have NEVER had to blow on a burger before taking a bite!  the manager then said I ate too much of the burger to get money back.  I was not asking for anything.  She was so insulting.  She took the next 15 minutes on the Micros register to take $2.95 off my bill before I was able to pay and  NERVER go back!!!  The roof of my mouth peeled and bled through the night and it still is bothering me a day later.  Burned by a burger.  Burned by the Peppermill!",

Neon lights, fake flowers, mirrored ceilings and the hustle and bustle of a favorite neighborhood restaurant. I love this place and had to introduce my millennial aged daughter who fell in love with it too! The food was plentiful and delicious. We both ordered waffles. But couldn't help eyeing the Flintstone sized BBQ ribs and mountain of nachos. Better than the food is the staff. We sat at the restaurant bar and was greeted by everyone who passed by. Super friendly, conversational and accommodating. This is an awesome, fun and affordable place to eat when in Vegas. You have to try it's perfect for post drinking hunger.",

Our waitress was very helpful with suggesting what to get and How to order. She was very attentive to the table and it's needs.  So let me say i ordered an omelet which usually consists of 2-3 eggs and when my omelet came here it had a dozen i was so initially intrigued by all the egg on my plate and decided to split it with my sister. And you think that this would run my a lot of money... no it was very inexpensive i can't put an exact dollar amount but somewhere in the low tens. Everything was big   There was another room where it had a fire pit lounge area and bar. So nice and completely different in the decor that was outside. It is very unique and a restaurant  that i am sure that i will never forget! Thank you",

The Peppermill has not changed in years and full of enough neon to have their own Neon Museum.  I love it!!  The food portions tend to be the highlight at the Peppermill.  Every dish is on steroids.  For the bros out there, I don't mean that literally.  They hook it up to the max at the Peppermill and still manage to keep the price per meal very low.  I used to come here for their burgers, fries, nachos, and desserts.  They're all good.  But now, it's all about their 10 egg omelets.  That's not a typo...10 freakin' eggs AND it's still served with toast & hash browns.  I even talked to one of the shift leaders and she stated that most people eat only half of their meals here.  Well, not this guy. I will deMELish their omelets every chance I get.  Their omelets are so good that it would be a shame if I had any leftovers.   This restaurant is always busy and a wait for a seat should be expected.  The service is top notch as well.  I highly recommend the Peppermill, especially if you're craving a beast of an omelet.   Just a note... Some people have mentioned that the Peppermill looks like strip club inside. All that's missing is a stripper pole.  I beg to differ with these people and think they got it backwards.  I think a strip club looks more like a Peppermill.  All that's missing is their 10 egg omelet.    2017 Yelp Review #52",

    "text": "There is something so intriguing as a stand alone restaurant on the Strip. Over the decades, bits and pieces of stand alones (stores, cafes, smaller casinos) have been plucked from the ground like weeds. I think it is a good thing for Vegas's economy but I also feel that something should be preserved, maybe that's why I have always liked this place.  I have a fondness for Peppermill because it is as old as I am, we were both born in 1972.   On my most recent visit, I bought a friend for brunch before I ran him to the airport. As soon as we were seated he mentioned that it reminded him of diners in Jersey where he grew up. I felt I made an excellent choice because nostalgia is always a good thing! We decided to split the enormous pancakes and Joe's San Francisco Special. We also ordered coffees and of course this cocktail darling couldn't resist one of their glorious Bloody Mary's!   The portions are huge so it may be a good idea to split it or know you will have breakfast food leftovers for awhile! The Joe's SF Special was like a huge platter of \"stuff\"... Eggs, ground beef, sausage, spinach, Potato, cheese all together. It was pretty awesome and comforting. The pancakes are huge! When the serving platter was placed on the table my friend exclaimed \"What's this?\". Uh those are pancakes my friend. I really want to meet the spatula that flips those pancakes. Do they use two arms to flip it? I'm pondering but need to finish up here. The Bloody Mary! Get one. They are beautiful and yummy, especially needed for a Vegas brunch!",

Joseph, our driver, took us all over the strip and then down town. We were having such a great time getting to know our surroundings and chatting it up with our driver. He asked us if we wanted to see something really cool. We said \"Yes\". He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)",

For breakfast, I had the Marco Polo which was also ok but a little bland. My husband had the pancake breakfast and he liked it. The waitress was hurried throughout the order and only stopped by when she was dropping off food. When asked for more water, etc. she seemed very put out. The restaurant ambiance was cheap, old school Las Vegas. Overall, not impressive especially considering there was such a long wait to get seated. The portions are big and that's cool. If you are in Vegas for a long time and are super bored, this place is for you. If you are here for a short trip, skip this place and don't waste any gambling time or the chance to eat at much better places on the strip.",

    "text": "I hate giving spots three stars but this place didn't warrant a terrible two but it also wasn't a good 4. It's just sort of 'meh'. As far as value goes- their portions are large and the pricing is very good compared to most of the eateries on the strip. Wait time for a booth was about 15 minutes but since I was eating alone, I opted to eat at the lounge which was only a 5 minute wait. I ordered the pancake combo- which included 3 large pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips and choice of eggs. The pancakes were fluffy but lacking in flavor, but the sausages were very tasty! Couldn't finish the meal even though I was starving. Also ordered 2 muffins to-go (1 blueberry and 1 lemon cranberry) - reheated them in the microwave for 45 seconds and they were delicious! Definitely recommend the muffins!!  The server who took my order seemed annoyed but the rest of the wait staff was really nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the peppermill again but if my friends wanted to try it out I wouldn't say no either.",

We came at 1:00...my first time for lunch, and they were packed.  We had to be put on a waiting list, but it only took about 5 minutes to seat us. However, after being seated, it took them at least 10 minutes to even come ask for our drinks...well, non-alcoholic...the cocktail waitress was right there. Gotta love Vegas.   Anyway, I ordered the Conquest (no onions of course) at the waitresses' suggestion and it was just mediocre. The roast beef was bland and the sandwich needed more sauce. The bread was good though. Fries were ok, but a little greasy.  The ice tea was good.   Next time I will just go with my own choice. LOL!",

    "text": "Peppermill ended up being the place that most surprised me in Vegas, I wasn't really sure what to expect but now I recommend this place to anyone I talk to who is planning a trip to Vegas.   We came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time].   We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip.   Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace.   There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch!   It is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus.   If you are looking for an affordable place to stuff your face in Vegas - definitely try the Peppermill!",

John Travolta in his disco dancing clothes dancing up and down the isles while groupies are in their roller skates in skimpy shorts and crop tops rolling down the walkways. The bright blue, red, and purple neon lights reflecting from the mosaic mirror ceilings and interior trees separating patrons booths give this place some pimpish flare.   In another room is the Fireside Lounge, a sunken area with a fireplace in the middle (now tvs) where you'll find the likes of Chuck Norris in oversized sunglasses on one side and Barry Manilow on the other chicks on each arm drinking a Fuzzy Navel and a Blue Hawaiian that matches their butt-tight groovy threads. Tatu from Fantasy Island is pointing at the disco ball saying.. De plane.. de plane!  I can only imagine those days.   The food here is average fare. It's all about quantity here with average quality. Breakfast is served all day. Go ahead and be a kid and eat pancakes for dinner. The pancakes here are huge. They're bigger than your face big! The quality, however, is sub par. It's too starchy. I prefer IHOP compared to the pancakes here. We also shared corned beef hash, poached eggs, (gave away my tomato to Coco), and a side of toast. Thought it was good but mostly made up of potato.   Service here is great though with friendly waitresses who smile and are attentive.  Prices are reasonable. It's best to share with such a large quantity of food. Expect a long line and wait especially if you're a large party. Have a groovy time here baby!",

I also liked how even though it was quite busy the server didn't try to hurry is to leave - lol.  Note that they are closed the week of Labor Day for remodeling.  I can't wait to see what it'll look like as it looks pretty rad as is.

    "text": "The Peppermill is a Vegas version of Denny's but with large portions and retro decor. It really does look like it a throwback version of what Vegas was in the 70's. The employees wear weird costumes that I don't quite understand. The waitresses dress in blue and white overall/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. But the service itself was sort of slow. It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers.   The do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....  But as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt.   This place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less. I wouldn't suggest the Crab Cake Bene nor any of their other lunch items but they do serve Breakfast all day 24hrs so it seems like a great drunk place to visit. Other than that its mehhhh",

It's Vegas, so we didn't even bother sleeping after a long, long...well, LONG Sunday night that somehow turned into 9 AM on Monday morning when we rolled through here. Luckily at that time, not much going on aside from other similarly displaced stragglers, so no wait whatsoever.  If you need some solid breakfast food (or honestly any kind of food) to cure your morning woes, then you've definitely come to the right place. Ordered the chicken fried steak, absolutely hit the spot for me. Plus the portions are HUGE...definitely getting your money's worth here. Also, if you get a chance, their onion rings are completely on point.  Service was great, decor really did remind me of those old school diners from back in the day. Honestly not sure how I hadn't been here before, but it will definitely become one of my go-to spots in the future!",

The Peppermill is sort of a Las Vegas landmark and staple; having been here since the 70s (It was even used in the movie Casino). The Peppermill is still all original inside with it's cool and almost Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy like futuristic lighting and funky neon colors. The staff are extremely attentive and very very nice and welcoming, the wait times aren't ever really that long and the staff does their best to seat you as fast as possible.   The food here is absolutely amazing and ranges from your breakfast staples like pancakes (which I highly recommend) to dinner favorites like steak or wings. The prices here are also what's a huge selling point for this place as Peppermill really isn't all that pricey despite being a stones throw from the Strip. I ordered the pancakes and got 3 massive pancakes (literally the size of my head), a huge dollop of butter and syrup, 3 pieces of crispy bacon, and a soda all for only around 12 bucks.  Now I do have a small gripe about this place but it isn't enough to ever get me to stop coming. The booths and tables are a bit small so if you have a bigger group you may end up being a bit uncomfortable even in a big booth. Other than that I absolutely love Peppermill and will be returning.",

Not wanting to dampen our night out I thought maybe if I add some sugar and lemon it would help but no. Brought it up and the Manager was so snotty. Read your menu, know your product before you argue with a customer. At least offer to take it off the bill. Accepting that it's just a drink and moving on I ask for a box to take my food, which was pretty decent, the server gave me a warped to go box.

    "text": "Do you ever want to eat breakfast in a place that looks kind of like a strip club but is not a strip club?  No?  Well if you like good food, you should eat here anyways.  Great food at a reasonable price.  Went here with one of my buddies after night one of Vegas.  We knew that going to something at the Grand would be expensive and probably not very good, so we asked the door guys for the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  They both agreed the Peppermill was the spot.  It's also close to many places on the strip, a ~5 dollar uber ride or 10 dollar cab ride for us.    While we were on our way, I was anticipating this quaint little diner, maybe some knick knacks on the walls, etc.  Well, I was mistaken to say the least.  Going in here, everything is neon and mirrors.  That being said, it was 7 in the morning (we were on Florida time still) and the place had plenty of people, so it was a good bet this place was legit.  The menu itself is impressive.  So many different varieties of breakfast food.  I got the French Toast Ambrosia, which is just, enormous.  Whoever can eat this in one sitting is clearly contributing to the national health care crisis.  The french toast was very good, not too heavy.  However, it is laden with whipped cream and about 5 different kinds of fruit, so it will fill you up.  The half a liter of syrup I added to it may have contributed to its density as well.  The fruit is good and fresh.  It's not mind blowing, but this is a LOT of food for a great price and, if you're staying at a hotel or something, you can bring back leftovers and have several breakfasts or share with friends.  If you're in the area, bring your sunglasses and come down here to grab a bite.  It's a great way to escape the hotels and have some good food in a more local-type Vegas atmosphere.",

Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. \"It will be about 10-15 minutes\" she said. Wow!  And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.  Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.  Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back.",

    "text": "The wait was long, but we knew that going into it. Was told 20 minutes - ended up being a little over 40.  As soon as we sat down, we were approached by someone who took our coffee and water orders (not the waiter) then came the cocktail waitress. Those came out with lightning speed. After that, everything became snail paced.  Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and didn't acknowledge us for a while - did mention to us a couple times that he'd be right with us as he was zipping past. After a while, my friend got impatient and headed to speak with a manager and that's when our waiter showed up to take our order. Coincidentally.  Manager made sure our food came out quickly so that was nice. Food was decently good which is why this is a 3-star and not one. That and cus the bloody mary was so so good.  Got the crab cake benedict which was delicious - the eggs were made perfectly. Eggs benedict was incredible as well - my husband said it was one of the best ones he's had which is great since that's what they're known for.  my buddy got the feta cheese omelette which he says he gets all the time.  Biscuits and gravy - YUM. perfect biscuits smothered in a sausage gravy oh my goodness.  Food 4/5, service 1/5, manager redemption makes this a 3/5.",

The lounge has large round booths (with a few around fire pits) and the lighting is very nightclub-esque, even at 10am on a weekday.  Service is friendly and prices are reasonable for the HUGE portions, think family style.  Perfect to share.  There is a parking lot if you drive there and its' conveniently located on the strip across from Circus Circus.  It is shocking how many people don't know about this place...I recommend it to anyone who asks for Vegas must visit restaurants.",

Again, probably my bad choice in ordering a salad at a venue probably better at specializing in fried food, burgers, and breakfast .

The neon lights and booth setting makes for a visually pleasing atmosphere while you enjoy your breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Only draw back is that they only have 2 areas if you have a large party of 7 or more.   Would recommend you make reservations in that case.  And BTW, breakfast is served 24/7!",

    "text": "So apparently The Peppermill is the \"it\" place to go for breakfast/brunch in Vegas. I clearly didn't know this, but thanks to one of my Yelp friends I was in the know. I was hesitant at first to try this place, but I'm glad I took his advice and tried them. I was pretty pleased with this brunch. The staff was extremely nice as well. The one thing I will suggest is going early if you don't want to wait. We got there around 10:30-11:30 (I don't remember exactly) and we had about a 35-45 min wait. They were packed but they do move pretty quick.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my husband ordered the Maserati Omelet. The Egg Benedict comes with 3 poached eggs on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with Hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns. The dish was so simple but so good. The Eggs were cooked perfect. The Canadian bacon was good as well. It was tender and not salty. Some bacons are salty. The hash browns were cooked perfect but had no flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on my potatoes to jazz them up a little. Once I did that they were ok.   My husband ordered the Maserati Omelet. It had sausage, Jack and Cheddar cheese, and mushrooms smothered in a perfect Italian meat sauce, sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese. My husband loves mushroom and sausage omelets so this was a no brainer. However, he was a little hesitant about the sauce so he ordered it on the side. He actually liked the sauce with the Omelet so he ate it with the sauce. He said the Omelet was very good and filling. He only ate half the Omelet because it was so big. He said the same thing I said above about the hash browns. He also had a huge pancake. He said it was rubbery and not soft and fluffy. It was not anything special.   Also with my husband's meal, it came with a choice of muffin. He chose the Cranberry Lemon Muffin. It was amazing!! It was served warm and tasted homemade which I loved. It had cranberries in it with a lemon curd. This was the best muffin I have had from a restaurant. It was just so fresh and flavorful. Definitely try!   Overall, although The Peppermill was so simple I loved my breakfast. I just wish the hash browns had a little more flavor. The pancake was also not anything special. Other than that, I enjoyed The Peppermill and thought it was a good suggestion.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite steak & eggs for breakfast in Las Vegas... I've driven by Peppermill countless times in the many years since I have been coming to Las Vegas but I hadnt tried it until a couple years back. I had asked my friend Judith who is a local and worked in the tourism industry what was her favorite steak & eggs. She immediately said Peppermill... So after landing in Vegas on the first flight out of Burbank we headed for the boulevard and some grub.   The wait is long. It was Saturday morning and we waited about 45 mins for our table of 2. It was also Halloween weekend so that might be another reason for the crowd. We were starved by the time we were seated. There is a bar off to the side of the hostess station inside that they direct you to while you wait. Or there is a waiting room up front or people wait right outside the door. The parking lot is huge and it needs to be as they get super busy.  My NY steak and eggs was great. ($18.95) I had asked for scrambled eggs and hash browns along with my thick cut NY steak. It was cooked a perfect medium and i scarfed it up with the quickness. It was a tasty steak breakfast. The hashbrowns and eggs were good too. It comes with toast as well.  Service was friendly. They have a big menu but I didnt need to ponder much on what to order. Steak & eggs all the way for me. The decor inside the Peppermill reflects that of the neon side outside. It's like Tropicana loud. haha... You will see. That was great meal we had.",

The service was great and the food was really tasty and were huge portions. I decided on the chicken Alfredo and it was creamy and delicious. My wife ordered the Pesto Burger with fries and she said it was great. My daughter had the kids pancake and it was huge. We will be back soon!",

They have a variety of omelets, all huge and cooked well. Pancakes, also huge and done well. I order the hash browns extra crispy and they always get it right.  For lunch I like their Reuben sandwich.  I haven't had a dinner their yet.  Every waitress that has served us has been very friendly and service is always great.  The Fireside lounge is a retro vegas throw back that is pretty amazing, for what it is - miles of neon, zilions of little mirror tiles on the ceiling, velvet booths, flaming fountain conversation pit, cocktail waitress in long black gowns, good drinks. The appetizers in the bar are a mixed bag - decent bar food, some good some ok.",

Even the service was mediocre just wasn't impressed expected at least OK food with all the good reviews didn't even get that. Save yourself the time and money (way too costly for quality) and yelp a mom and pop breakfast spot off the strip you'll get better tasting food with better prices and customer service....oh and the \"type\" of people that were here when we came?????.... Pure ghetto I'll leave it at that. I don't want to get interrupted by ghetto hooligans trying to get my number while I'm eating my nasty food no thanks yelp you can keep this place I WONT BE BACK!",

We ended up coming here for dinner.  The portions are huge and the food was good, not amazing. Service was great too. The one thing I will remember and will go back for is the potato salad. I didn't order it, but my friend did as a side and rejected it because the waiter told him it was made with yogurt instead of mayo. I tried it and it was one of the best potato salads ever. That's the only reason why I gave this place 4 stars, otherwise it's ok. haha",

    "text": "Fun place!  We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday.   We had a friend staying at the Wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the Wynn restaurants. None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.  The decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!  I can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.  We had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.  On the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)",

There's a separate bar area from the restaurant inside known as fireside which is right by the restroom area.  Inside you will find a fire pit within a jacuzzi, along with neon lights,  trees, and velvet chairs and couches.  Inside the main restaurant the theme continues from the waitresses outfits to the specialty drinks that are on the back of the menu. My mom was taken back by the drinks since she hasn't seen them being poured (made) in a while. Kudos for that!!  As for the food everything we had was really good. We enjoyed the French Toast combo and Munchs breakfast. The portions were large and filling and the price couldn't be beat.  While at the restaurant we ran into a couple who stated they were told about this place by their limo driver. The couple had only heard of IHOP, and the driver told them that, \"IHOP was like kissing your mother and this place was like kissing your lover.\" I thought that was a funny analogy.",

    "text": "Have seen the place over the years of working in, or just visiting Las Vegas.  Finally decided to try it after reading all the reviews.  I enjoyed the look of the place, and the lounge is small, but kind of cool.  Don't know what all the 5 stars are for, perhaps for the look of the establishment, couldn't have been for the food.  The food was just okay.  I ordered eggs, sausage links and hash browns (they don't serve home fried potatoes - what a shame).  I was disappointed that the sausage links are turkey.  They also tasted like nasty.  My hash brown potatoes were cold.  Our service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed to prefer spending more time at other tables than ours.  I never got that second cup of coffee I asked for during the meal, only when I asked for the check did she ask if I still wanted more coffee.  Really?  We also asked for extra napkins and condiments, and towards the very end of our meal they came.    One last thing.  I ordered a Bloody Mary at the lounge while waiting to eat breakfast.  For the price, you'd think it would be fantastic.  Not.  Plain tomato juice and a splash of booze.  It tasted like I was drinking plain tomato juice.  I was very, very disappointed, sitting in those very, very uncomfortable chairs at the bar.  My overall opinion is to stay away from the place, as it serves up food just a notch below Denny's.  It's bloody Mary's are terrible.  Both the food and the drinks are overpriced for what you're receiving, especially compared to other restaurants.  The service was for me terrible, especially when noticing that how they treat you like shit, then dote on others around you.      If you're going to cook and serve food, at least cook and serve it the same for each customer.  Not specific ones.  They seem to pat themselves on the back for having a restaurant with a lounge that has survived there for awhile (just an observation from the menu).  All I have to say is people are idiots if they keep coming back.  Over priced food and drinks.  Underwhelming flavor.  Terrible service.  Trust me, you'd be better off at McDonald's.",

This was in the 80's, when your parents sent you and your sibling off with a $100 bill each morning to entertain ourselves all day and night at Circus Circus and other hotels. To get around, we'd catch cabs like New Yorkers and would only go back to our hotel when we ran out of money. Parents. They had it so easy back then.  They say you can never go back to the old days, and going to the Peppermill lounge as an adult is that adage personified. (Not that I was in the lounge section as a kid.) Questionable quality of food that's highly recommended as delicious by all their waitstaff (???) strong, strong, STRONG drinks and hilarious dim lighting, accented by the blue pools of flames that the round booths surround.   It's so gauche, you kinda have to like it. Or be awed by it. If Jem and the Holograms had their own bar...this would be it.   But...  I wouldn't want to get out of control drunk here.  It's far from everywhere else; randomly located on the Strip. Avoid the food, have a couple of cocktails and ease yourself back on the road.",

It's a flashy place all the way to the colorful sugar crystals on the table. I remember when I first moved here we would frequent this place often. It was nice to see it really hadn't changed.  I started with the Tortilla soup because it was chilly in there. The soup was huge but too salty for me.  I only had a couple spoonfuls. I shared half of a roast beef sandwich with my brother. It was a good size. It was yummy and the veggies on it were fresh ! My cousin ordered the appetizer that came with chicken tenders, bruschetta, onion rings,  mozzarella sticks,  onion rings and butterfly shrimp. It was enough to share with the five of us. We still had left overs! The shrimp was my favorite because they were big and crunchy. We all shared a huge sundae which was tasty brimming with gooey chocolate ...yum!",

I've been wanting to try Peppermill for a while now, especially with all the reviews. We talked to a few locals who were concert go-ers that night and they highly recommended that we head over to Peppermill.    When you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It's next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.  We entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club/vegas dive bar/I really don't even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It's definitely one of those \"you must experience it for yourself\" kind of places.  I ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper's recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.  The S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I'm not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.  As the S.O. was eating his omelette, he said, \"Geeze, I'm getting full, I wonder how many eggs are in this thing?\" The waitress replied, \"Anywhere from 10-12 eggs.\" Holy heart attack, Batman! So what's the point you ask? Share, share, share!  The portions are plentiful here.  The service was also very friendly and great. The place was a little dead but I think that's only because it was a Thursday night.  If you are in Vegas and want a good late night dinner, I highly recommend Peppermill.",

Place was busy on a Thursday night but not too busy to get a seat.   The decor inside is so amazing,  with blueish hued lights all along the inside and fake plan life all around.   It's a nice place to come and wind down.  Check in at the front to be seated.     The waitresses wear cute outfits and mine treated me well and was courteous and checked in on me.   Sat at the bar looking into the kitchen.  Waitress took my order of wings and checked on me quite a bit once I got my order.   I was looking for a quick snack and got 10 mild wings.   They came out fairly quick, about 5 minutes.   They were pretty awesome, great flavors and textures.  They were good sized wings.  Paid with my waitress and on my way out.  Quick in and out.   Their breakfast options look pretty dang good too.  I'll have to come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "The Peppermill is one of those \"old Vegas\" places that you've seen in movies (Casino, Showgirls and more). They're on the the north end of the strip, across from the under construction Resort World and near Circus Circus. Peppermill is open 24/7 and even has a parking lot.   They're pretty much always busy so take that wait as a gift and check out their AMAZING lounge. It's all red velvet, neon and 70's fabulous. There's even a fire pit! Cocktails are predictable expensive - I had an old fashioned and it was honestly terrible. My mai tai on the other hand was very good! Know that they use a \"tap\" system that automatically measures alcohol pours so don't expect a stiff drink.   When your table is ready they'll call you over the intercom. Peppermill marches to their own drum in a lot of ways so if you order any drinks in the dining room you'll have to order them from a dedicated cocktail waitress in an evening gown (rather surprising at 11:30am). Prices (for the Vegas Strip) are pretty reasonable and portions are HUGE!! We saw another table get the fruit plate and it was a thing to behold - must have been 2-3lbs of fruit!   The menu is pretty much diner classics - sandwiches, all the time breakfast, burgers etc. I had the Cali burger ($15) which is a 1/2lb patty with cheese, bacon and guac. It arrived cooked as I ordered, with a mountain of fries on the side. I'd say it was a good but not great burger.   Service was \"ok\" as well - we didn't see our server much and a requested condiment never arrived.   Overall - food & service \"good\"  Atmosphere and the lounge - GREAT  I'd definitely come back!",

The Peppermill is always bustling with customers and the food is always good.  Today I had the eggs Benedict which is a favorite of mine here.  The dish always come out cooked to perfection with just the right amount of runny yolk.  We sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait in the long line of people here for lunch.  The service was quick as always and the food was delivered hot and prompt.    They have their own parking lot on site which is a delight and the bathrooms are always clean and stocked.  There is also a Fireside Lounge in the back, however I haven't tried that yet since I was always working when I've come here.  I will have to go back for their happy hour sometime and try it out, it's a very neat lounge.",

    "text": "They say that Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, here at this place you can have it at any Time of the Day. Whether its first thing in the Morning like it usually is, in the Afternoon for a Later Lunch, stop in here for Dinner and (why not) come here really late like almost 3 or 5 in the Morning. Back in 1997 when I was 6 years old watching a Rugrats Special in my PJ's and watching Clark Griswold (played by Chevy Chase) taking his Family on a Vacation to Sin City that came out the Same year was the first time I ever heard of Vegas.  The first time I ever heard of this place when I watched one of the Best Travel Hosts on TV back in 2005 when he was in his Prime (Anthony Bourdain). It was the 7th Episode of the 1st Season of No Reservations when he was given an Assignment by a Food Magazine to write an Article about how Vegas and all of its Glorified Power on how it became a Culinary Mecca for some of the worlds most renowned Chefs. This place was featured in the Episode Halfway through and 12 years later was my first time here.  Dad was interested and we walked 25 minutes to get here, through Walkways and Side Streets and past Strangers who were bugging us for Money by starting up Random Conversations. But we eventually made it, this place was across from Circus Circus, walking through the door and seeing people sitting down meant that it would be a long wait. At home (anywhere in Buffalo) if it was gonna be more than 10 minutes then he would just go home cuz he wants to be sat and have his Breakfast. He only makes exceptions when he's out of Town.  They said it was gonna be about a 20 Minute wait, so we went into the Fireside Lounge area, Lounge Chairs surrounding a Water Table with a Flame enticing the Middle with a bright Flare. While waiting for our Table we split a Bloody Mary (Vodka, Tomato Juice, Frank's Red Hot Sauce), I for one don't like Savory Drinks, I took a few sips but only Tolerated it as Dad powered it down with a Fury like it was Red Bull. The wait was over and we were sat in the Back by the Windows, one thing I admired was the Vibrant Colors and the Floral, Fauna and Forest like Ambiance.  To start off Dad got Coffee and I got a Mimosa (Orange Juice and Champagne) but I wasn't expecting it to be served it a giant Chalice like Glass (I thought things were only bigger in Texas). Dad got a Vegetarian Omelet with a side of Hash Browns while I a New York Strip Steak (Cooked Medium), Poached Eggs, Hash Browns and a side of Rye Bread Toast. The Egg Yolks were completely encased in their own Whites that were placed in an Oval shaped Plate which I put the Eggs on top of the Steak and broke each Yolk over to act as a Rich, Velvety Sauce. The Browns were tender to the touch with those crisp outer edges you crunch down on, also when I looked at Dad's Omelet it was huge (looked like they used about 6 or 7 Eggs to make it).  I ate and enjoyed all that while being underneath an Air Conditioning Vent that was sending chills down my Spine. How ironic that Vegas is the Hottest place in the US and I'm slightly freezing, I told my waitress twice to turn it down but no luck. We finished up, paid up front and then went back outside to warm up, both Food & Service were on Point. Come here any time of the Day to get your Food and Drink on. !!!",

The food is ridiculous but in a good way. I normally come for breakfast. The portion size is again, RIDICULOUS!!! No human should be able to eat it all but some do.. Lol.

I won't go through the menu but imagine all your favorite breakfast items JUMBO sized and delectable, that's what you'll get at \"The Peppermill\".   Now this is somewhat of a tourist attraction so be prepared to have a restaurant photographer come by your table and take a pic of you and your full belly!\"The Peppermill\" is a strong 4.5 performer but the only reason I'm rounding down and not up is because they no longer allow cigar smoking in the lounge..

    "text": "This place is a trip. Seriously worst service I've ever had in a restaurant until half our group left, ate tacos, and came back. Our waitress was good after that. It was so bizarre. We had a group of like 15 and five of us were there early and wanted to order. We had a cocktail waitress come to us three times. A picture lady. 2-3 different bussers we talked to. And two other waiters who had tables near us. So we asked like 10 people if we could order food and they all were like \"let me send your server over.\"  For 20 minutes this nightmare went on. Nah trick take the damn order. I've served tables. You ain't in a rush I see you.   Man, one server lady was so damn rude about it. She must have rolled her eyes straight out her forehead. I had to pick them up for her.  I told the hosts, they didn't care either. Seriously three hosts just chilling chatting. 100 employees near the food prep line. It was busy when we got there but when we sat, the rush was over so no excuses. And for the rudeness. I wish I could describe her. It's weird but a lot of staff here look similar. Especially on the restaurant side.   The bar side looks like it used to be a strip club. All red lighting and easy seating for lap dances. They play weird music videos where you aren't sure if it's cheesy intentionally or not.   Food was decent. Big portions. Standard diner fare. Crowd is like 40's locals it seems like. Not a cool place at all. We got some fruit and they literally just plopped every fruit they could find on a plate.  Their banana nut bread was bomb though.  The irony is that there's a comment card awaiting you on the table when you sat. They obvi don't read them.   I couldn't spot a manager anywhere also. I think he? was near the expo line. At least that's what the host lazily pointed towards when i asked.",

We decided to come for breakfast, my son ordered a fruit granola yogurt parfait, and my other son ordered eggs and sausage.  Wife ordered the French dip and, I ordered the Reuben.  Everything that was served to us whether it was a kids entree or not was absolutely huge, the portions can easily feed two people.  The sausage links look like three connected together.  Everything tasted great, service was prompt and friendly, an all around solid diner.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant after going through Pinterest.  It said it was an iconic Vegas restaurant, so we decided to try it.  It is on the northern part of the strip, near circus circus area. It's a small stand alone restaurant.  We used uber to get there since we were staying on the south part of the strip, however I also noticed there was a bus stop near it as well.   We came during happy hour, so some of the drinks and appetizers were discounted and we took advantage of that.  I got the creamsicle, and it was very good, tasted like a real creamsicle.  We also got mozzarella sticks, there were done well and tasted great.  For meals, we got the barbecue burger and Rubin sandwich.  Portions were huge!  Great deal for the price.  Food tasted very good, I would recommend this restaurant to others as well.",

I ordered a soup and a bagel today which was quite delicious, but the service was really slow. I couldn't believe how long it took.   After finishing my bagel, I decided to get dessert. I always get the colossal sundae here and it's usually amazing, but they kept messing up my order. I asked them to change the vanilla ice cream to chocolate, put chocolate syrup, and to remove the nuts. When it came, the  ice cream was vanilla and there was nuts. So I sent to back, and asked them to fix it. When it came back, they changed the ice cream and removed the nuts, but there was now a giant brownie and it was covered in hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup.   I was very disappointed with their service. Compared to what I was used to, this was terrible. But the manager was nice enough to remove the ice cream from our bill.   And along with all this, our waiter had a rude attitude.",

    "text": "Wow. Who would have thought there would be a good decent price breakfast place by the strip. True gem located right next to the Riviera Hotel. (: Does big portions and good prices reel you in?   My fiance and I were craving brunch but somewhere cheap and not overpriced (like most places on the strip). I'm actually surprised he found this place because it's not one of the first things to pop up. Anyways we came here around 10:30AM on a Friday and it was pretty busy.   The scenery totally draws you in. It's dark with neon purple blue lights running with fake trees and plants. Totally unexpected, but it was nice.  Even the table had some colorful sugar! You can always ask for plain sugar though. (:  Oh and the seats are all mostly booth seats. Yay.   The food. Wow. Seriously. Did I mention big portions? My boyfriend got one of their specialty omelettes and I got the Belgium Waffle (can I be anymore boring?). Anyways, the omelette came in a huge plate with depth, and 3 slices of toast. Big. Filling. Delicious. I wish I had gotten an omelette. Belgium Waffle. So crisp and so fluffy. Minus the fact I had to scoop off the huge amount of butter on it since I forgot to ask for it on the side. Yea presentation of the food may not be the best, but at least you know you're getting the best for your dollar. (:  Service. The lady at the front was so nice! She starts conversation and attends to you ASAP. The waitresses wear these old school uniforms, and work fast. So you can expect to get your food quickly.   I'll be coming back here for breakfast/brunch if I stay on the strip. Better than waiting in line at those over priced brunch/breakfast places on the strip.",

Being vegan I still actually enjoy a good junk food midnight indulge every once in awhile... And wow this is the place to do it...wow... So WTF does a vegan order there? Not the yummy looking brushetta because it has cheese in it :)  Going light:  I get the TOMATO STACK CAPRESE STYLE  Sliced ripe tomatoes layered with fresh Mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. With NO CHEESE of course.  Going for the full Monty: I get the CAPRESE STYLE CIABATTA.  Toasted Ciabatta, fresh basil, Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and pesto sauce, served with fresh fruit ambrosia.                                    With NO CHEESE of course. Oh and forget the fruit ambrosia lol I think it means marshmallows and it's not because the marshmallows are not vegan.......it's because I want their famous pound of french fries.   Sounds healthy huh? But I don't care because you know what...those HUGE cocktails that they bring to me are not healthy either ;)   Keep in mind that NEITHER of these items are available in the super duper Fireside Lounge area...just the diner side. But no worries just grab drinks in the Fireside and then head to the diner side...or reverse that situation!  So basically the once-in-a-blue-moon times that I come here I leave with 3/4 of a yummy meal and a belly full of yummy cocktails :) :) and I don't regret it...I think...",

Our waitress - Jennifer - was so nice, and she let us know about the huge portion sizes (an omelette has 8-10 eggs!) and that there is no plate sharing charge. So we ordered a plate called Munch's breakfast...absolutely delicious and big enough to share, all for $13.95. Love it!!",

    "text": "We first came to the Fireside Lounge just before Halloween. I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would \"treat you like big shots\" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.  Then we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.  Now here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, \"you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated.\" We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No \"thank you for dining with us\" or \"have a nice holiday\" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left.   I would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee.",

Great food, awesome service, fast, and the atmosphere was one of a kind. We went here for breakfast and let me tell you, we were STUFFED by the time we left. They give very big portions of food. I got an omelette with hashbrowns and toast, he got country fried steak, with hashbrowns and toast as well. Neither of us could finish our meals.  Our waitress was very quick and polite. The place was just fun to be at. They came and took our picture once we were finished eating and gave it to us as a souvenir (we liked that a lot). They also serve very big and delicious mimosas. If you're in Vegas, TRY THIS PLACE! You will love it! :)",

    "text": "This place is waaaaay over hyped! I found this place on yelp and decided to go on Christmas Day! We walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. That was ok since it's Christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. But we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about.  Our waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos).  It came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!!  So we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!  All in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance!  Don't waste your time and money here. There was way better local places to try! The 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! That's it!!! Good luck!",

The red velvet booths, the sunken flaming fountain, the low ceiling and the tasty cocktails make this a fun night on the seedy end of the strip. Easy walk from the Wynn and the Encore, but a million miles away in cool.  Order some kind of vintage cocktail, settle back into the velvet couch and enjoy Vegas of a bygone era.  Cheers!",

Gave this place 4 stars because the prices for some of the dinner entrees are outrageous, in my opinion, but I realize the portions might make up for that. My husband got the gyro sandwich that came with onion rings (huge onion rings), I got the turkey burger which came with sweet potato fries (and lots of it!) and my son had the kids meal pancakes with sausage (the pancake was humongous).  The highlight of my meal was the turkey burger. I think that was the biggest,  juiciest, best tasting turkey patty I have ever had. Yes the decor is cheesy and out dated but my son was in love with all the neon lights and my husband was in love with all the short skirted waitresses and massive cleavage of the cocktail girl.",

Where else can you roll in with your drunken gaggle of friends or \"friends-you-just-met\" at 4 in the morning and receive yummy plates of food in a relatively decent amount of time, before your eyes blur and you pass out in your food? The waitresses are chatty and nice, and have big hair with names like martha and chainsmoke outside....so friendly and lovely!   A great place for late night /early morning food and also a great place to people watch...on the night/morning I was here we spotted some basketball players from the Warriors ...  I didn't know who they were until my friends told me...but not after one of the players poked me on my shoulder while walking past and i just screamed WHO IS THAT!? IS HE FAMOUUUUUUSSSS!?

    "text": "As Frank Barone used to say, \"Holy Crap!\"  And I mean that in a good way.  I walk into this place early on a Saturday morning and it's packed, with families, all-nighters, bikers and such.  My waitress tells me later this is nothing compared to when they have conventions, the place is wall-to-wall busy.  Today, the place was hopping.  And so were the waitresses, who were wearing their tight skirts that fit right into the Vegas old school.  Lots of blue neon lights.  I take a seat at the counter. Yes, the service here is a little slower, but hey, I was in no hurry.  Finally, my waitress offers me drink and a menu.   I look at the menu and have a hard time figuring out what I want because of the various options.  I pick the French Toast Ambrosia. A few minutes later, my long-legged waitress Jennifer brings me this plate of french toast that is covered with fruit and what looks like a half can of whipped cream.  I'm thinking, how in the world am I going to eat all this?  And as I look around, everyone else is being served huge volumes of food also.  At that moment, I decided that I am going to the Peppermill every time I go to Vegas and I'm bringing my friends.  Yes, the food was very good.  No, I did not finish it all.  But it did make good leftovers.  How did I miss this place after all these years?",

Well, the Peppermill is the stuff Vegas dreams are made of. This IS Vegas.   The decor is bright and dramatic with a blatant disregard for subtly, and yet is perfectly muted so that even the worst hang-over would be welcomed by it's glowing neon.   We had breakfast. The omelets were huge and fluffy with plenty of toppings. The Oatmeal was well prepared with a nice helping of raisins and banana.   My chicken fried steak, which is my go-to dining out breakfast, was absolutely spot on. One of the best I've ever had.

Its not hard to find, its right on the strip, not too far from the WYNN/Encore Hotel. Basically in between Sahara & Spring Mountain streets. Portions are big, and everything's not too bad for the price. Fireside lounge is cute...kinda romantic? The main restaurant decor is of course semi cheesy but I like it, it kind of lets you know...your really in Vegas hahaha.  So far I think one of my favorites off the menu is the Peppermill Pastrami Burger 11.95 YUM! Also if you ever get hash browns try it with cheese and country gravy  on top. For some reason that combination tastes really good when you've been drinking =D  By the way....just the head's up... its CROWDED on a friday/saturday night, hahaha but that's already a given.",

I recommend the scorpian. Its huge with like 8 different shots but tastes like fruit punch! Or the grasshopper, its like a blended thin mint mmmm....  Great appetizers too!

Denny's on steroids was my first thought...but it's much more than that.  It's a Vegas institution...  And it was our first stop on our trip this time out.  We were not disappointed.  The place will not leave you hungry...and the prices won't leave you broke!  I had the Philly Cheese Steak...I fully expected it to come with the thinly shaved variety of \"meat\" that adorns most Phillys...but was surprised to find big, meaty hunks of honest-to-god STEAK on this sammy...  Cooked with Peppers and Onions, and not just completely drowning in Provolone...this was actually one of the best Philly Cheese steak sandwiches I've ever had.  It may not have been even remotely authentic, but DAMN was it good.  The Onion Rings were righteous too.  A little on the greasy side...but who cares?  3 days of eating like a 5 year old were in store for us...  What's a greasy onion ring gonna do to me?  It's really a tasty, cheesy treat, that makes you want to start quoting Swingers lines.  Please, refrain from doing that...ever...again.  But it makes you WANT to.  Real bad.  Enjoy!",

Proceed promptly to the cab stand and go to the Peppermill (the lounge portion)  Anything short of that is inexcusable.  This place is the beginning middle and end of any good trip to Vegas.  It will get you in the Vegas vibe immediately and rejuvenate you after a long night out in it's warm bosom of semi-circular banquettes.  The drinks are dead on and the black gown clad waitresses are divine.  Their Manhattan is one of the best I've had anywhere.  The food in both the lounge and the restaurant comes in significant portions.  We usually order the Nachos in the lounge which feeds 2 guys just fine to accompany post travel drinking.  Most important of all, this place has a quiet kitschy mirrored wall pink neon class that connects the present to the Vegas of old.",

There's a restaurant to the right as you walk in so stick to the left and enter the lounge. The bar is dimly lit with neon lights and the seated area is also to the left and the rear. As you walk in there's the flaming pool surrounded by circular tables with only room enough for 2-3 people per table. There are circular booths that are comfy and make you feel right at home. The cocktail waitress was personable and gave us enough space to enjoy our drinks with friends and made sure we were taken care of. The drinks are not expensive and are made strong. The ambiance is great and I couldn't help but feel like I was in a movie scene from Casino.",

If you happen to be Andre the Giant or a member of the I.F.O.C.E, you'll be able to eat everything on your plate.  Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.  I sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting. The waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.  The Peppermill is just a diner with a lot of flair.  I'll return on my next visit to LV.  You should too!

We order nachos oh they are soooooo good site by the fire and drink huge strawberry daq's just next time keep me away from the sprinkles and straws.

Funky decor, neon lighting, big fake trees throughout the restaurant, and the wonderful Fireside Lounge.  This has got to be the best diner in Las Vegas, and the setting is unforgettable.  In the lounge, the video poker machines at the bar are fun, but the seats around the water feature and fire are the best!  Last time I was in, I saw Brooke (Punkin) from Charm School.  She was having fun with some guys and kept getting approached by fans.  We left her alone.  The food is very good, as far as fried stuff and diner food is concerned.  Don't expect a healthy meal here.  The service is quick and friendly and the price is fair.  If you like the Peppermill in Vegas, the good news is that they have an entire casino and resort in Reno under the same name that takes the crazy design to a completely different level.",

They have fantastic wings and there not way the hell over priced like at the Bellagio cafe.      I love the decor as well, The neon is great, and the tree running all over the place is nice also. My only complaint, the damn booths are for tinny people! Im not a small guy and I have a hell of a time fitting into any of the booths. This is the country with the fat people remember?

Didn't touch the mashed potatoes because I didn't want to fill up valuable stomach space but they piled it high on my plate. All that food for 35 bucks? Heck yeah! The service was great.

I was pleasantly surprised as I sat down to a clean table and seat. I was half-way expecting to find sticky somewhere as I slid into the booth. Clean. The dim lighting was just triggering bad memories of past stickiness, but now I was happy and comfortable. My review of the menu stopped at my target, and now I was anticipating a promising fruit covered Belgian waffle. I was in my happy place. When our order arrived my suspicions were confirmed--Vegas IS \"sin city.\" I was satisfied just inhaling the aroma of the fresh waffle imagining the taste combination with a large dollop of sour cream and blueberry syrup. I really--no, REALLY--wanted to eat the entire thing, but I didn't want to burden my teammates with having to carry me 1 1/2 miles back to the hotel. (I didn't eat again until 8 p.m.) The two other breakfast plates on the table looked very yummy and large. My idea of a perfect breakfast cafe has been forever changed.",

Portions are just huge, everything from salads, huge pastrami sandwiches, omelettes, chicken, and burgers will overcrowd your plate when brought out!  After your meal, step into the other side of the restaurant over to The Lounge, where they have a full bar (low top), several booths, and a sunken circular seating area with fire coming out of a bubbling fountain.  Fantastic place to have some cocktails and relax.  And, if you happen to just come in for food, their nachos plate is enough to feed 6 people!

Asked for it to be cooked a little longer and the manager stared at the chicken in the light for 2 minutes, telling her waitress that the chicken was fine and to give it back. All while I'm staring at them at the bar. Finally got a new sandwich and the chicken was over cooked and my sandwich had no pesto. Fries are generic, food could be better, so could the customer service. Should've gotten an apology for being served undercooked chicken, instead got an attitude. I could've went to chic fil a for a generic grilled chicken sandwich.",

    "text": "The Peppermill has always been talked about through social media!   Peppermill this... Peppermill that...  I've heard enough about the Peppermill restaurant being a Vegas staple on the strip so I had to check it out for myself. I was craving steak for breakfast but the Americano Cafe in Caesar's Palace had their steak at a high mark up $45+!! I did some researching and found that the Peppermill's steak was only $28. So I got on a Uber for only $7 to get to the restaurant to try it out.  Excited and thrilled I was when I got there because there was no wait at all. It's located just north of Encore and across from Resorts World. The inside kinda resembled a 70's Vegas style cafe, kinda what you'd expect when the mob ran the hotels and designed it with lots and lots of velvet and 70's neon lighting.   My Ribeye steak was huge and it came with a freshly made salad with three pieces of huge Texas style toast. The steak was cooked perfectly to what I preferred (Rare). I love my steaks bloody and juicy. From time to time, my waitress checked on me and quickly refilled my water. Just checking the decor makes you feel like you time warped back to the 70's era of Las Vegas. I consider this cafe a win win!",

This is a great place to go for a fishbowl sized drink or a fishbowl sized Sundae. It's also a great place to go if you're trying to complete a Man vs. Food type challenge or if you want to order a single entree that will feed your entire family of 6 with leftovers. There is never a shortage of exceptional people-watching, including both the patrons and the staff. Also, when you sit down take a gander at your sugar dispenser. You're welcome. Mindblown yet? Well guess what else - they sell that unicorn poop AND the dispenser at the front when you're paying. BOOM. Vegas. You're welcome. Enjoy.",

Amazing breakfast!!!! Everything tasted exceptionally well, great portions, not too over the top big but not skimpy by any means.   I love breakfast I just don't eat it often so I don't visit many breakfast spots. But I have to say this place is just a \"well oiled machine\".

I've never actually been here for breakfast, although I've been here during \"breakfast hours,\" but I have heard their breakfasts are great.  No, it's not new, extremely clean, or filled with gorgeous modern decor, it is more along the lines of Vegas in the 70's, at least everything I can imagine that was good about Vegas in the 70's:)  I once heard that this is one of the oldest operating businesses in Vegas but I'm not sure if that is True.  Their bloody mary's are delicious, the portions are large, and they have a large selection of finger type snack foods,  which is good after a drunkin' or somehow otherwise intoxicated evening:)  The service is always top notch and the waitresses, no matter what age, are all attractive and wear long black dresses.  Yes, that may seem cheesy but personally, I think it is unique and I love it!  Everything from the red velvet seating to the hot tub like fire place contraption to the mirrored walls with christmas looking lights everywhere help add to the perfect \"old school\" Vegas type of experience.  I \"heard\" that lots of \"dancers\" like to hang out here after their shifts are over at the various gentleman's clubs....wink, wink:)",

The omelet was bigger than the size of my face. I swear!! It was good cause it was nice and fluffy with the freshest ingredients. The hash browns OMG the hash browns were so crispy and good. I noticed they also add sweet onions to it cause some bites would be sweet. I finished the hash browns first before I finished my Omelette.. The Corn Beef Hash was sooo good as well. It was like happiness in my mouth!   I tried the Bloody Mary and it was pretty good. I could taste the celery salt with the big celery they put inside it.

    "text": "The atmosphere of Peppermill is reminiscent of Downtown Las Vegas' \"hey day\". The motif of neon lights and wall to wall mirrors (looks like deconstructed disco balls) scream \"old school\".  You have plenty of choices when it comes to the fare. It's quite a cornucopia / mishmash of food.   I had the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty, but it wasn't something that wowed me. Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.  Basically, I should have tried something that was more on the \"diner\" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves \"BBQ\", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order \"BBQ\".    In conclusion, Peppermill is more for nostalgia of earlier Vegas with Denny's type food. It's just a smidge above Denny's, but not by much.",

Every time I go, I'm never disappointed with the price, food or location.  Their drink menu is extensive and fun. The food .... Every order will undoubtedly require a box. The location naturally entails a plethora of interesting people (celebrities and hookers a like) . When in Vegas..... Peppermill it.",

Fire pits, surrounded by tropical looking plants.  Very Cool!! The restaurant is ALWAYS crowded.  The portions are HUGE and they are open 24/7.  We had lunch and the sandwiches were so huge, that I only ate half and then had it boxed to go,  Which I gave to a homeless person.  Food was great...  They also have a person who takes pictures, which is so hokey.  But again a throw back....   I would highly suggest this place, because it's almost a tourist attraction in it's self that most people don't know about!",

Watching the kitchen cooks, expediter and servers was a course in discipline, control and efficiency.  It was a beautiful thing to watch.  My three eggs, cooked as ordered on a mound of delicious crisp homemade corned beef hash and a huge fresh bagel with cream cheese and strawberry jam was outstanding.  My wife's platter included eggs along with bacon, sausage, and French toast.  It's so good to be married to a slim women;  I helped finish everything and it was all to die for!  This is the Hash House A Go- Go (which I loved on previous visits & will return) without some of the showmanship.  If you want breakfast go to Denny's.  If you want a fabulous memorable breakfast make the Peppermill a must visit.",

    "text": "7/5/13 Breakfast  3.5*  Unless you eat at McDonalds or a food court, there is no cheap meal in Vegas anymore, at least not on the strip. Prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. Peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. And it's open 24/7.  It's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. Think purple neon lights and trees inside. Waitresses clad in Hawaiian-theme uniforms. This is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. That said, I only come here for breakfast.  *Fruit Plate with Banana Nut Bread ($13.25): This is literally a basket full of fresh fruit--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.  *Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.  *Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.  *Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option.   It's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. If you want to challenge yourself, get the French Toast Collage with four wedges of French toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. Eat yourself to a coma. Quantity certainly supersedes quality here. It's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. Service is quick and friendly. It's a no-frill place on the strip north of Wynn between Encore and Riviera. Crowd range from divey to genteel retired. Get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10.",

    "text": "This review is for the lounge only as we'd already had dinner and came here for the dive bar ambiance and drinks.  From what I could tell, the lounge is to the left, restaurant to the right. Inside the lounge/bar area, it's dimly lit with couches sprawled around all over, and small fires burning in central areas (usually with couches encircling them). As most of the fire areas were occupied, we found a small section and sat down. The menu had an interesting list of drinks and we each picked out something when the waitress came by to take our order. I chose a weird \"cream cheese icing\" drink just for the hell of it.  Our drinks came out and I was presented with a martini glass rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and this eye-crossingly sweet icing flavoured drink. Seriously, if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, don't get this. I love sweet drinks and it was delicious but it pretty much made me done with drinking afterwards!   We had a small incident that resulted in my drink on the floor (and on my pants) and the waitress who saw it came over and cleaned it up, while we apologized and asked for a second one to replace it. She brought it over and even though the spill was our fault and we expected to pay for it, she never charged us for it! Hooray! (we did leave an appropriate tip to show our gratitude!)  The bar itself isn't too loud and rowdy (we were there between 11:30 pm and 12:30 am, give or take). TVs scattered around up on ceiling were playing videos of live performances of a range of music, mostly 70s and 80s rock, which was pretty neat to watch.  Sadly, we didn't stay, just long enough for the one drink. As we had just flown in that day, we both had a sudden crash and wanted to just to find our hotel and rest up. We had planned on staying for a few rounds of drinks but unfortunately did cut it short. This place is on our list to return to though next time we're in the area, as the dive bar atmosphere was pretty awesome and the service was top.",

The portions were big though and the food wasn't bad, it's just not the reason you come here really. Decent enough though.   The main attraction is the restaurant decor itself. I LOVED IT! The restaurant is filled with cherry blossom trees all over the place with pretty branches of flowers hanging above you. Coupled with neon lights, this just makes a picturesque environment.  The Fireside Lounge was AWESOME! It's a separate room from the restaurant in the back. Dim mood lighting with pinkness everywhere! Big comfy pink couches with the cherry blossom trees overhead as well. Wish I was able to stay and grab a drink but we just had breakfast... Haha I'll definitely be back to enjoy this lounge. There's also a fireplace pit surrounded by water. So cool!!   This is a great place with all the Vegas flair. Kindy tacky, kinda over the top, super themed, but so fun! I recommend everyone checking it out!",

Went and had mimosas inside their fireside bar while we waited 30 min for a table.  This place is always busy but totally vegas from the decor to the staff.  The portions are huge and the one lets are all fluffy and cooked to perfection.  They were out of egg whites unfortunately but the breakfast was pretty much can't miss.  Have never had a terrible experience, and would recommend to anyone that is coming to Vegas!",

Seating is a bit tight but they do offer tables, I'm a big guy so its not chubby approved to me... Just saying.  Plenty of parking and for the price its outstanding taste and value.

    "text": "A visit to the Peppermill is always a staple when on a visit to Las Vegas.  The overall above quality diner food, attentive waiters, and excellent atmosphere always provide for a great visit.    On our most recent visit on Saturday at around 11 am, we knew it would be busy and were told there was a 45min wait.  In comes the Fireside Lounge where we able to find a seat to pass the time where we ended up easily waiting 25 minutes before being asked for our drink order.  Once our drinks arrived in a timely fashion after ordering, they were exactly what we wanted.  As our wait grew longer, we began to wonder if we were forgotten.  At the hour and a half mark after hearing name after name, we went to check on the status of our table for 3 and upon arriving at the hostess stand we discovered our name had been erroneously scratched off at least 40 minutes prior.  Upon this discovery they promised to seat us right away, which they did.  We ordered a mixture of lunch and breakfast items and as always they were huge portions and delicious.  Once seated for our meal, everything exceeded our expectations.  Disappointed in the hostess service and lack of trying to recover better, but with dozens of great meals we've had at the Peppermill over the past 10 years, this was the first dropped ball we can remember.    PS Favorite items are Nachos with beef and the Reuben with onion rings and always wash it down with a 64 oz Scorpion drink!",

Sure, it's a moderate pricing but the portions are well worth it. From appetizers to foo-foo drinks, everything is big. A personal fave is the Scorpion Bowl, a big drink for two I usually handle alone. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you had best bring your appetite.  A club sandwich that resembles something from Carnegie Deli? Pancakes wider in circumference than the plate their on? Great for a date night niche meal or just a late night hankering. And don't forget the lounge. Not an abundance of seating but what there is is plush and comfortable in the classic Vegas shadows. The fire pit is a nice touch with that special squeeze to get good drinks and appetizers and spend some time. Local or visiting, it's worth your time and appetite.",

I thought it would be in a casino, but from the outside it looks like an old Denny's complete with cheesy writing on the windows. But just ignore all the families waiting for a table as you bypass the restaurant and venture to the lounge for tropical drinks and shenanigans.  This is what a 70s pick up bar looks like in my dreams. Jack, Larry, Chrissy and Janet would love it! A dark jungle filled with couches and vines and touches of neon on the ceiling. Servers are lovely ladies in long black dresses slit to the hilt who join you on your lounge when taking your order. If you don't mind being part of the PDA show, sit on a loveseat in the firepit and become mesmerized by the bubbling electric blue liquid. Couples that want a little more privacy, should sit at one of the tables.  The majority of their cocktails are fruity tropical drinks and they pour heavy.  My early drinking days were filled with pina coladas and mai tais, but I've since transitioned to elegant cocktails. So it was like handing the reigns back to my early-20s self. I didn't have a care in the world here. They have a few beers, but nothing on tap. Prices are a bargain compared to other lounges on the Strip.  I've got to admit that there are a few buzzkills to an otherwise ridiculously awesome Vegas experience. There are TVs everywhere and they play a continuous loop of bizarre music videos and performance pieces. For every bit of Vegas spectacle (Cher) there was something absolutely ridiculous (early Mandy Moore or really late Hall & Oats). About half of the acts couldn't even be identified. It was sort of like watching and listening to a slo-mo hair band audio car crash. The more significant issue was the continual interruption of the speaker announcing that tables were ready in the restaurant.   But if you can tune out those distractions, it is a swingingly good time. Mission accomplished!",

    "text": "I thought this would be a nice place to grab some food and it was. This place usually provides real good service. However, tonight I ordered chicken nachos with no jalapenos. I came in with my TT, sister and a close friend of me and my sister. I had to wait nearly 20 minutes for my food while everybody had their food. It wasn't too busy and I was a bit annoyed. The waitress was pretty nice and patient with us so it wasn't her fault. I really don't appreciate when other workers roll their eyes and scoff while were eating. You guys should be glad that you have guests. Without us you won't have a paycheck. The staff needs to work on being a bit more professional as I overheard an employee complain about her shift. I myself work graveyard for another restaurant. All I'm saying is that be more professional and don't complain to other co workers about your shift. The whole staff needs to be more professional. Not the usual service I get when I come here. It's still a great place to spend money on food.",

First we checked out the Fireside Lounge and it was happy hour. My friends and I ordered the famous Scorpion drink and MAN it was super strong! For our appetizers we ordered crab cakes, shrimp cocktail and chips and salsa.  The crab cakes could have been better. To me there was really no flavor to them.   After hanging out in the Fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. We got fettuccine Alfredo, shrimp scampi Acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. My boyfriend and I were very disappointed with our food. My shrimp scampi wasn't good at all. So bland.  All in all, I don't think I'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Ambrosia French Toast, No melon, with whip Carrot Cake  Rarely one to stay out late and certainly not the sort to do so while drinking heavily only to find myself craving greasy food at 3:00am I'd be lying if I suggested the iconic Peppermill had ever interested me as more than a sort of Las Vegas curiosity and yet with a 12-mile run and a few donuts from Ronald's already under my belt it was with a 'what the hell' smile that I entered the neon-lit space with mirrored ceilings just as the cops arrived to deal with an unruly inebriated couple who were refusing to pay their tab.  Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later.",

    "text": "For the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at The Fireside Lounge for drinks and appetizers at Happy Hour.  This place is a Las Vegas icon.  Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.    To be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.    My drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:  -Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.  -Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!  -Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.  -Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!  -Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.  -Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!  I know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.  Nothing that really blew me away.  I would go back because of the status of this historic icon.",

I'm always amazed that people will excitedly say \"the portions are huge! woohoo!\" without taking into consideration that they just paid for two dinners worth of food that they couldn't possibly finish. French fries are no good the next day. What's the point of spending $18.95 on a hamburger and a pillowcase full of french fries that you can't finish and that isn't good the next day?  On top of this the service was terrible and I had to go to the bar to get a beer. The bartender gave me a bottle and a pint glass that still had two tablespoons of water left at the bottom.  Yeah.....no thanks.",

It was packed, the wait time was long, BUT you can chill in the lounge until a table is ready for you. The ambiance is so weird, but fun at the same time. I can't begin to describe the funky waitress outfits they have.   After spending the weekend on the strip glaring at all the overpriced food and beverage spots, I had the best affordable cup of coffee EVERRRR. The average price for meals was about $10-15. I got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich with fruit and it was SOOOO GOOD. I tried my friend's Country Fried Steak--it was AMAZING. Portions are huge and you really get what you pay for!   Great for tourists...open 24 hours, plenty of parking, take debit/credit, slots in waiting area, souvenir group photos, and an experience to remember! I will be back for sure!",

Back to what we were talking about, I started eating my B.L.T and halfway through the B.L.T I felt so stuffed to the point where I felt like I ate 20 B.L.T's! It was very filling. On top of all that it came in like 10-15 minutes after we sat down! The service was very nice very fast very skillful and the food is amazing. I highly suggest coming here!",

    "text": "On Monday July 25 2016 at 12:30 pm, Myself along with four friends decided to dine at The Peppermill Lounge in Las Vegas. We are from Maryland and decided to visit this restaurant after seeing great online reviews. This is probably the only vacation we will have for the upcoming year so we wanted to indulge. We had no idea we would be so disappointed.  Upon entering the restaurant it was quite busy, that was completely understandable due to the population. The hostess was taking names and party sizes to be placed on a waiting list. I asked another patron about the wait who advised it was at least 15 minutes. Once at the front of the line a friend and I waited patiently for the hostess to acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes, were still not acknowledged. However, a female patron approached the hostess while we were standing there waiting and she was acknowledged. I guess I was born the wrong sex. The hostess proceeded to ask the woman her name and party size. Before the woman could respond my friend spoke up and stated that we had been waiting to be put on the list for some time now, he stated his name and our party size.  The hostess then stared at us in a rude manner, as if we did something wrong. We patiently waited for her to acknowledge us but we had to be the ones to initiate the communication to be added to the list and seated.  After waiting 30 minutes, our party of five was seated in the dining area. The server greeted us and delivered 3 waters to our table. Keep in mind, It was 98 degrees outside, a little warm in the room and we had a party of 5. We advised our server multiple times that we needed two more waters to accommodate our party of five. The server then immediately blamed the busboy. We were not trying to be confrontational, we just wanted 5 waters as we had a party of 5. Eventually after asking multiple servers and busboys we got the two remaining waters which took way too long.  Upon resolving the initial hostess and water issue, we were approached by a bar attendant. The attendant asked us if we would like to order any alcoholic beverages, we replied Yes.   I ordered a Pina Colada. When my drink arrived, I took one sip and instantly experienced a taste that reminded me of sour milk. After taking a sip of the unsettling beverage I called over the waitress.  I explained my concerns with the drink, she then advised me that the drink could not be exchanged but they could attempt to fix the sour taste. She stated that there was nothing she could do and sent over a manager.  The manager, I believe her name was Peggy advised me that they could only attempt to fix the drink and could not make me anything different in exchange. She then chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\". I replied, I have never had a Pine Colada taste like sour milk. She then said she would be removing the drink from my bill, but wasn't very nice. I guess I was supposed to just deal with the taste of sour milk in the prepared Pina Colada.  After getting that issue resolved our server delivered our food, but failed to accommodate our condiment request. We made six different request for syrup and by the time it was delivered our French toast and waffles were cold. In addition, three of our meals came with muffins which we did not get until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and will never forget the treatment we received.  Overall, the food was ok, but it came out late and incomplete. I felt totally insulted by the manager who chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\" in regards to the Pina Colada. I've had many Pina Coladas and they've never tasted like sour milk or resulted in a stomach ache. I almost feel like there was malice behind it tasting the way it did, and that's unacceptable!   I felt discriminated against when trying to be seated, as me and my party was overlooked by the host, but other parties were helped. 3 parties that arrived after us were seated before us to be exact. Not to forget about the attitude we received when we initiated the communication to be seated. As a restaurant goer, I am totally disappointed in The Peppermill Lounge and will make it my business never to return to this establishment. I will also spread the word to family and friends.  In addition my friends who also bought alcoholic beverages stated the drinks had a weird taste. They also wanted to return there drinks but due to the managers comment they just paid for them without drinking them.",

Everyone loved the retro 80s atmosphere.   The only downside to the whole experience was the wait for the table. Well, there are two downsides. They don't have vegetarian dishes on the menu, so one of us had to order a specialized item.  Our food came out very quickly. The waitress did miss a few items and had to run back a few time, but she got quickly.   Overall we had a great experience.",

I couldn't believe all the pink trees inside. Definitely fun and quirky.. Totally Vegas. The food portions are so huge. We shared an omelet and I was certian we wouldn't finish it all.

I brought an out-of-town friend here who, like me, has an appreciation for the ridiculous and the brightly colored, which this venue has many times over with tons of pink neon lights and 80's music videos playing on repeat.   We grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack.   Beyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound. The bowl is great as a one-time novelty drink, but I wont be ordering this on my next visit to the Peppermill.   Cheesy music, velvet couches, and neon lights. I'm there.",

A win in my book--the ambiance was great as was the food!! The Bloody Mary I wasn't too impressed with flavorwise. However the onelettes and muffins we ordered were amazing! The Mediterranean and the Maserati were both great and the hash browns were cooked perfectly. My husband ordered the blueberry muffin and I had the cranberry lemon, they were incredibly moist and delicious. We definitely will be back--only reason for my four star review is the fact that we waited awhile before being greeted by the server and offered beverages or asked if we were ready to order. They seem like they're constantly busy though so I get that, and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Overall I'd definitely recommend the Peppermill Restaurant--is like to return and check out the lounge at some point.",

We were told to stand near the cashier, Jennifer, for 1st come seating at the bar. Jennifer did not greet us, until I spoke to her. I then went on to confirm if this is where we needed to stand & she confirmed unknowingly (looking confused).   Jennifer advised there were 2 openings coming up.  So, as I looked near the bar, some man from the restaurant walks near the open seat, without being in the line, so I informed Jennifer, but she just said he's not supposed to. She did not help, so I walked near the seat to see if the guy was actually sitting, and he did.   I then asked for a manager. Martha, the manager brushed off our concerns by saying, \"Well, that's only one seat anyway!\"   So, we were given False information from Jennifer, and the manager made as if we making a big deal out of the seat, since it was only one, but we were advised of the seating rules from the host & Jennifer. First bad impression!   The food & our server, Horacio, was exceptional. Ask to be seated with him.",

From what I saw coming out of the kitchen, the portions are absolutely gigantic! Next time I visit, I believe the buffalo wings will be in order, as they looked incredible.  Place was packed, but the food comes out very fast and I loved my server, who was very friendly and was interested enough to talk with me about my visit to Vegas. Easy to get to by bus and right across the street from the Circus Circus. Next year, I will be back!!",

Ordered nachos that never came out ( wait the beans, meat, salsa and sour cream did). When asked about it were lied to and told it would be right out as the cook maxe chicken instead of beef even though the beef was brought out 30min prior. Waited over an hour to have the manager then come and question our motive of wanting the food off the bill as we no longer wanted to wait. During this time the nachos arrived as a tray full of chips with melted cheese. No thank you. Looked around to pay the bill and the server is leaned up against the bar more interested in talking to her coworkers then getting us out. Had to walk to her to pay....thank you next",

I felt welcomed and our Server made us feel right at home. No issues with any of our orders ( 4 adults + 1 child). She catered to our needs and was very polite and patient while taking our orders. We tipped her accordingly   Food : 5/5 Our food came out in a good amount of time. Children pancakes came out 2 minutes later like she promised. Everything came out hot & was delicious. I got the BAJA BURGER (fire roasted green chilis, habanero pepper jack cheese , applewood smoked bacon , on grilled brioche bun). My girlfriend got the LORRAINE OMELETTE ( Eggs , diced bacon, sauteed green onions and melted Swiss cheese).  The portions were sooooo big definitely worth every penny plus more.  Will definitely be eating here again on our next trip to Vegas",

It takes some time before a waitress offers to get a drink and when she does, she asks me repeatedly if I'm opening a tab. I say no, but feel pressured.   I order a Hawaiian Sunset Mimosa with Shrimp Cocktail, total comes to $25 before tip. The shrimp cocktail sauce had some strange additives in it, and the taste was homemade but not well made. The Mimosa was tasty, but I was less than thrilled upon finding a strand of the servers hair in-between the strawberry and pineapple garnish atop the glass.   Afterward, I needed to use the restroom. One stall was without toilet paper and both had paper scattered all over the floor and was clearly quite dirty.   If the Peppermill considers their \"70's feel\" to be a selling point I'm less than impressed. The only thing 1970's was the music videos on the Samsung TVs above the fireside lounge.   Overall, a well dressed establishment attempting to make up for less than savory dishes and outrageous pricing.   However, I will mention the servers were polite, despite their thinly disguised attempt to hide displeasure over my refusal to open a tab.",

    "text": "Growing up in Marin Co. in Northern CA, there was a Peppermill in the next town.  As a teenager, we'd go in late night for coffee and french fries to gather and gossip.  Lots of good memories for me.  That Peppermill is long gone, but I always indulge when I'm in Vegas.  They are open 24/7.  Want breakfast after an all night bender playing cards in the casinos or a Sundae dessert to drown your sorrows after a March Madness loss?  Go to Peppermill.  Peppermill is a throwback time machine trip to the 70s, and I mean that in the best way possible.  The restaurant decor is plush, comfy booths with neon lighting and the waitresses serve in Playboy bunny-like outfits.  The cocktail waitresses wear polyester evening gowns and serve drinks inside the Fireside lounge with a firepit made of lavarock.  Definitely a \"boom chica wow wow\" vibe.  They are popular at all hours of the day, so don't be surprised if you'll wait a few minutes to be seated.   The secret is out.  Service is excellent.  Coffee is always hot, fresh and bottomless and you'll never go without a refill.  Inclusive of the rainbow sugar dispenser on the table. I indulge in their iced tea.  I learned the serve Teva brand and I am a big fan.  Food is Americana fanfare and you can't go wrong with diner style comfort food.  Burgers are huge and a satisfying portion.   I enjoyed the 3-tier Club Sandwich. Freshly sliced real turkey (not processed lunch meat)  crisp bacon, lettuce and tomatoes served on lightly toasted choice of bread.  So big, you'll most likely take a doggie bag home.    Peppermill never disappoints  I get good, decently priced mega-quantity food and a time warp visit back to my teenage years, all rolled into one place.   Be sure to visit and get the throwback experience......you'll be glad you did.",

I had the French Toast Ambrosia, which was your typical French toast with a mountain of fruits on top of it. It was a good dish, but not the best French toast I've ever had, hence just my 4 stars.

The server was great, and they also had a cocktail waitress for drinks (kind of odd, but a beer's a beer.)    We knew we would have leftovers so we ordered the Sampler to add to the \"next day meal.\"  It is a giant plate of fried food.  Chicken tenders, cheese sticks, shrimp, and GIANT onion rings.  If I had a complaint, it would be the onion rings are too big.  Also with the mass of grease is a few pieces of Bruschetta.  Thet were good, but the tomatoes seemed as if they had been marinating too long, kinda squishy.  Dinner, I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger.  Beef, Ciabatta bread, pesto, red onion, tomato, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and instead of lettuce.... a crapload of basil leaves.  This is now one of the top 5 burgers I have ever had in my life.  Srsly, this burger blew me away.  The beef was \"ok,\" nothing that amazing, but the combination of the pesto, basil, pancetta, and fresh mozzarella... you (yes, you) NEED to try this.  The appetizers and service were a 4 star.  That burger makes the entire experience 5 stars.  Definitely going back.",

We had to wait for about 20 minutes. We almost knocked over some old people tryin' to grab a seat at the counter. The food is not cheap but the portions are ample and it's good, basic food.  The lounge is the place to be, however. There ain't nothin' like sippin' a cocktail in the fire pit! Hopefully fickle Vegas will never tear this place down!!",

The breakfast rocks. We had some egg,sausage,spinach,hashbrown,cheese sauce concoction... something San Francisco.  And the French Toast plate. Total yumminess. Hell the food coulda sucked and I would still love this place!! 10 a.m and waitresses in flowing black satin cocktail dresses. I want to live here. Anthony Bourdain, thank you for turning me on to this place!! I cannot wait to come here at 3 am.!!",

The sugar dispenser have colored sugar. there is just the right amount of neon and fake trees. Most of the servers seem to be from the former eastern block countries and I am very happy that the wall came down. Hubba Hubba. If you are over 21, I highly recommend the lounge. dimly lit. benches surrounded by fountains with gas fire in the middle of the water and classy swank cocktail waitresses, dressed in long black dresses, sits down next to you in to take your order. It is a nod to the old Vegas. If you are on the town, this is a great place to wind down an evening with good friends.",

    "text": "So we were spending a weekend in Vegas and a buddy mentioned he wanted to check out this spot. I had seen this spot featured on a random network showcasing the restaurant. I agreed we should try this spot so I didn't eat much all day so I could indulge a bit with a breakfast at 2am. As we showed at 2am, a little tipsy I may add, we all head to the RR to wash up I ask if I should put our name down for a table? My buddy looked at me a little confused and replied,\" They have a f'n restaurant? Were here for the lounge.\" To this my reply was,\" They have a f'n lounge? I was here for the food.\" Turns out we caught to different shows featuring to different sides of this joint.  As we enter the lounge we were set back by the decor that seem not to have been updated from the mid 80's, but it worked. The environment had a certain level of comfort that you don't get in a big hotel lounge. Great group seating, this spot even had a fire pit indoors. None of the music was dated I say past 87' but as I said it worked. A mix of locals getting off work and tourist coming and going we ended up drinking and eating for about another 3-4hrs. Our waitress was beautiful to the point we were willing to take each out to spend sometime with her, it was great.   This is definitely the spot to hit if you want away from the Vegas norm.",

There will be plenty of taxis to take u back to your hotel or just walk across the street to circus circus and catch one. Menu is filled with so many breakfast staples Let me tell you.. the portions are huge. I dont think ive ever seen an omelette so huge or a breakfast skilled so big. Lots of stuff going for it. They have alcohol too.This is where you really want to eat. TIP: sit at the counter if you can. There is no wait.. just sit down. My husband and i ate for $40. Hotel is usually around $80.

    "text": "This place is a gem!  It's located on The Strip and has a parking lot. The decor of the restaurant sets the perfect  mood for every occasion - not too wild, not too low-key. The vibe actually feels like you're someplace special. WARNING: Either come with a big appetite or with people to share your food with. The Peppermill serves huge portions. To save money, consider ordering one entree per 2-3 people.   My daughter ordered chicken parmesan with a side of potato soup. The soup could've been a meal in and of itself.  She had that and didn't have any room for the chicken parmesan which looked like it could've fed 3 people. Also, she'd been served the chicken parmesan with green peppers which she specifically asked them not to do. They graciously apologized and cooked it up again for her without the green peppers.   I only ordered the Nachos, Nachos, Nachos appetizer. I really wanted to share this with my husband to save money but he went and ordered chicken tenders and fries anyway. He said he would help me eat the nachos and even ordered a side of beef topping for them. Well, guess what happened? He dug into the nachos and barely touched his chicken and fries. The nachos were okay, but I did not find them to have as much flavor as something like Chili's Classic Nachos appetizer. If I had to do it all again, I would've ordered crab cakes instead.  If you want an alcoholic beverage, you have to wait until the cocktail server comes to your table which I found mildly irritating. Your regular server won't take your drink order.  The restaurant also had a photographer. He came to our table and offered to take group photos which came out great. We purchased two prints for $25. Wonderful mementos being that one of my daughters were celebrating her 21st birthday.  When the birthday girl excused herself to go to the restroom, our server asked us to stay so that they could wish her a happy birthday. Then, as soon as my daughter returned, our server suddenly swooped over with others and sang happy birthday to her. It was hilarious!  Our visit to the restaurant was a wonderful end to a long, tiresome day. We had fun and were well taken care of.",

Not too sweet and very tasty, the waffle was fluffy with a nice crispy outside unroll we soaked it in the amazing blueberry syrup.  If you come at lunch/dinner the nachos are a meal for four and come in a build them yourself style.  Very nice if someone in the group doesn't prefer a topping.",

Alex our busboy and Crystal the waitress was awesome but I will say Ben could use some guest service skills and I mean I didn't pay for my soggy bottom sandwich or eat it I sent that $15 bad boy back and I left without having any dessert cause I totally went to the gym and planned to eat some brownie sundae or a banana split ..  Either way this is one of the worst Vegas dining experiences I've had just because there wasn't even an offer to make a new one so honestly I'm going to just say this place is a cool 24 hour tourist experience for the setting ONLY and the cocktails seem cool but man oh man   Don't try their sandwiches or fries and expect good quality   Maybe they have new chefs but for me I am mostly baffled by the managers zero Fs but our tab was $9 and we tipped Krystal or is it Crystal $10 cash so it was not only one of the worst strip meals but also the cheapest lol  So thanks for that ?  I guess I should be thankful they serve Pepsi and not coke or it maybe would've been more $  Needless to say I'm a Hangry hippo lol",

The portions are HUGE and was really good ! Our server was great as well ! We had many servers come by to either bring things to our table and to check on us. Which is Awesome team work !! Even a seperate cocktail server as well. From beginning to end was a great experience. Food, drinks, servers and atmosphere.

    "text": "My family and I had reservations for 8:00 pm tonight on a Sunday. We celebrated my son's 26th Birthday. He has memories of The Peppermill Hotel & Casino in Reno from when we would visit my parents years ago and when we lived briefly in Reno back in 2002-2004. We moved to Henderson last year from living in Phoenix for 14 years.  This location didn't disappoint. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We were led to a comfortable booth by a friendly hostess and handed menus. We were given time to peruse the menu while our drinks were brought to our table. I ordered an iced tea, my two sons and daughter ordered Pepsi and my husband ordered ice water. My husband read that the portions are huge, so we split the fish and chips. The chips were a large serving of curly fries with a dinner salad.  My son ordered a French dip with au jus and fries. My daughter ordered a Cesar salad with grilled chicken. Service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly, efficient and attentive. She refilled our drinks and checked on us often.  Our food was delicious. It arrived hot and fresh. The fish was crispy and hot with just the right amount of batter coating it. My son's French dip had a lot of thinly sliced roast beef and cheese. He liked his fries. My daughter enjoyed her Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was moist and not over cooked. My son ordered chocolate ice cream and the team of waitresses and waiters came out and sang to him. The ice cream was served in a large stemmed glass dish, topped with a lot of whipped cream. My son and daughter shared it. My other son didn't want to eat dinner there so he drank Pepsi while he waited for us to finish. While we were waiting for our meals, a gentleman stopped at our table and said one picture would be complementary and the others would be in a package deal if we chose to buy them. We agreed and he took our pictures. My other son didn't want to be in the picture; he has Autism-we respected his wishes. I recommend The Peppermill. They don't offer any discounts. We asked if they had a military, AAA or AARP, but we were told no, they don't give discounts. It's pricey and touristy. We paid with a tip $99.00.  However, the portions are huge. They feed you here, so if you come, arrive with an appetite. I advise you to make reservations so you don't have to wait as they get really busy. It's a popular place. Parking is free.",

The saving grace was the cool bar they have. The bar was in the movie Casino. It's a very cool retro bar. I was screwed over with my drink. I paid $22 for the Scorpion cocktail. It's huge and it was supposed to have six shots of liquor in it. I didn't taste any alcohol in it. I felt like I paid $22 for a virgin fruity drink. I recommend checking out the bar,but you can pass on the food.",

I rated this four stars at first due to being a a bit tacky in the unexpected decor but I think this over the top Vegas vibe is what was trying to be achieved. The scene is like a cross between your local old time diner meets an enchanted forest themed casino.   The staff is attentive and it's unlike so many restaurants in that they have dedicated cocktail waitresses and photographers etc. The waitress uniforms are also kind of adorable.   The food is incredible. Many dishes are impressive on presentation alone. I made the mistake of ordering the Fruit Plate off of the salad section because I wasn't terribly hungry. Holy smoke this thing was HUGE! Watermelon slices, pineapple, melon, strawberries, a whole banana, kiwi, apples, plus an entire banana nut bread loaf and side of sherbet. It was delicious!   The drinks were also on point which wasn't expected but greatly appreciated!   I posted a check in here in social media and friends from all over the country commented how much they enjoyed this place when they had made a visit. Check it out and see why!",

We needed more butter and syrup and we couldn't ever find her to get anymore.",

    "text": "This place was pretty great - went in March for a late brunch and the food was excellent. I really loved the funky old-school style of the place including the sparkly, multi-colored sugar in the sugar dishes. Only complaint was that the cocktail waitress took incredibly long to come to our table - my boyfriend actually got up from our table and ordered from the bar because she was taking forever to make her way. Of course once I was waiting for him to come back she then came to ask for our drink order which was no longer needed. The Hawaiian Sunset Mimosas that he brought back were really something else though, definitely the best mimosa I've ever had. Really all of the drinks they had on their menu looked great and the fact that the menu showed pictures of them helped to decide on what to order. Despite what happened with the cocktail order I will definitely be back the next time I visit Vegas.",

Still have found memories of that part of the strip so underdeveloped. All of sudden see small strip mall and all these neon lights. Not just lights talk about vibrant colors and ones that flash in and out. I remember the sign out front had even more personality but notice thats gone. =( Thankfully the restaurant still stands. It almost landmark of sorts knowing the history of the place combine with some of that Vegas style all its own. Really who would think place big fire pit right in the middle of the bar/lounge right next too the restaurant. Someone walking around asking if you want free pictures with The Peppermill as background. The diner style food breakfast, lunch, or dinner at anytime. The bright colors the waitress have on. Too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. NO disneyland but one of those things see Vegas could drum up and pull off.   I ended up getting the maserati omelette. Not like motherload of omelettte. It was smothered with lot of goodies. The best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. I barely finish half of it. It came with tasty hash browns. I enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. Along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. I went with the blueberry muffin. Nothing too rave about but still was good. Again huge muffin. My friend also had omelette. Seeing twins just as big. No doubt getting value on the strip here at The Peppermill.   I would could come back again! =))",

If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive.

Anyhow, I have a vivid memory of gigantic ice cream mountains here. Our group of 16 wanted to know if it was True or merely romanticism of good times past. When the food came out, all we could do was laugh.  Omelets made of dinosaur eggs (probably), ice cream scooped using shovels and a fruit plate that could have been used for a company party. Amazing and just hilarious. The Peppermill omelet, as big as it was, tasted very good. Loved the hash browns too. The banana split was right on - QUALITY ice cream and bananas.   The kicker was our service. Very funny, helpful and was very communicative about our table. Oh yeah, hung out at the kitchy lounge sipping on bloody marys. TVs with music videos including greats like One Direction. Wonderful.",

Facing a grim flight after nearly a week of avoiding casinolands and focusing instead on the awesome climbing and desert hiking that the area contains, I was hesitant to go into a place that I'd imagined as a kind of cartoon of a Vegas cliche. I relented primarily because it looked a reliable redoubt against the desert heat.  Guess what?  It was a cartoon of a Vegas cliche on steroids and psychedelics and it is truly a worthwhile stop.  With cocktail servers who all look like they stepped from a TV commercial opposite Ricardo Montalban, a surreal decor that verily shouts 1970s pickup scene, and a fountain that shoots flames, the important thing here to note is that they serve cocktails in glasses bigger than my head (and I'm a bit macrocephalous), it has subsequently become my most ritualized stop in Las Vegas.  I can't speak for the restaurant side. Because I don't know why you wouldn't just stay in the lounge side.",

After reading the reviews and looking at all the pictures I guess I kinda expected to eat around some sort of fire, but I was wrong. The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected.   I ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name).   The coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold.   The mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.    The Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich.   The portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews.   The service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed.   We probably won't come back here again. At least not until I'm 21 and can check out the lounge :P",

I mean, who doesn't want the Bourdain experience?!   So after an already long night of drinking, eating and more drinking my girlfriend and I hopped in a cab and ended up here and I'm glad we did! We didn't eat here but we did share a Scorpion. A tropical drink concoction that was the cap for the night! What is in it you ask? I'm not sure about everything but there is some pineapple and LOTS OF BOOZE...oh yeah and ICE CREAM! I don't think you will find it on the menu but you can order it.   It's a cool throwback to old Vegas that includes an awesome lounge, fire pits and a mirrored ceiling! It's got tons of character and has become a 'must go to' spot for me anytime I will find myself in Las Vegas. Yes, it is over the top and cheesy but Vegas is all about excess anyways!",

Best, one can hear the hosts announcements, so you don't miss out when they call your table.  Professional and good service, everything was smooth, its like a machine. Food was good, I asked and was told they use for each omelette 8 - 10 eggs! That's insane!  The nachos can probably feed 5 persons, my Focaccia Chicken Sandwich was not that big of a portion. was good. I would go back to the place.",

The waitress was nice and looked 16 which I kidded her about but she was a good sport and a very good server. I found it to be a good time and I loved the pastrami sandwich (so lean) just writing this review makes me want to go back. I have not had a good pastrami sandwich in a while.

The place is tacky in the most awesome way possible...neon lights, mirrors line the walls and fake shrubs everywhere just add to the ambiance. We went on a Thursday, well, early Friday morning and it was the perfect amount of busy. There were 4 of us and we found a place to sit right away. The seating is cool and intimate. The actual fire lounge area is meant more for couples as the couches that circle it only seat 2 people.   Looking around the joint, it was a good mix of people. There were some couples on dates, the obvious locals, larger groups and everyone was having a chill, good time.  The specialty drinks are as tacky as the decor and again, I say that in the most loving way. The four of us shared a big ass fruity drink called the Scorpion and then ordered 4 separate cocktails. We also ordered the sampler platter that consisted of fried chicken strips, fried mozarella, fried shrimp, onion rings and bruscetta, basically drunk people food :) Our bill was only about $70!  As far as I know it's open 24 hours, it's in the dicey area of the strip but who cares! It's worth the possible mugging  ;) We only hung out in the lounge area, didn't check out the restaurant so I can't comment on that.  This will be on our list of things to do while in Vegas for now on without a doubt.",

    "text": "My wife, kids and I dined at the Peppermill for breakfast on 7/3/08. I remembered ate here as a kid, though all I remembered was their giant hot fudge sundaes (they still have them).  The Peppermill is a very odd place. From the outside it does not appear to be anything special. Step inside and you will find a coffee shop that looks like a Denny's on acid. There are blues, purples and pinks everywhere. There are mirrored ceilings, tiffany lamps and faux cherry blossom trees.  The waitresses are wearing very short kimono type shirts/skirts. Making things more bizarre is that there is also a night club in the back that has pools in it that spit out fire on top of the water. Despite all of the craziness, the restaurant is 100% coffee shop in the front.  SERVICE: Everything was right on the money here. There was a delay in bringing my food. Though not a big deal, the manager came over and took a percentage off of the bill without us asking. Everything was very prompt.  FOOD: We ordered breakfast. Their hashbrowns are unique, I have never had ones like it. They were great and I am glad I ordered a plate of them. I could tell that they take great pride in the quality and preparation of all their food. Everything was outstanding. The kids ordered kids plates and loved them. We ate one of their gigantic hot fudge sundaes. The bill was about what you would expect to spend at a Denny's.  RECOMMENDATION: For a great breakfast, you have to go to the Peppermill. It is located center strip and should be easily accessible from any of the Las Vegas hotels. It is truly a unique experience.",

The highlight of this last trip to the Peppermill for me was the purchase of the rainbow turbinado sugar and sugar dispenser. I was asking the waitress about it when she informed me that I could purchase it! I WAS THRILLED! I got a 5 lb. bag of it complete with the dispenser. Best impulse purchase ever. The Fireside Lounge is also great to grab a drink while you wait for a table. The Peppermill is ALWAYS packed. Mimosas from the Fireside Lounge are on point! Must do.",

For the main course I had the BLT with avocado with a side of fries.  I have never seen so much bacon heaped on a BLT in my life.  Once I took some of the slices out, I was actually able to taste the rest of the ingredients on the sandwich - good, but I have had better.  The fries were also so-so.  My husband had the fish and chips and he too said he had had better.  Oddly enough, when I tasted his fish I loved it, and when he tasted my bacon, he said it was scrumdeliumcious.  A chacun son gout. The service was great, as were the prices;  spot on, I would say.  However, I have eaten much better.",

    "text": "This review is about Fireside Lounge, NOT the Peppermill restaurant.  The staff: Our waitress was friendly.  It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long \"gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress\".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?  The goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.    The atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of \"greenery\", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.  We went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it's Vegas.",

The pepper mill is one of those places that's on the hipster places one must visit in Vegas that's off the beaten path etc etc. I guess to some extent it still is, but it is by no means unknown or under the radar. The prices at the Pepper mill reflect the coolness of the old school here.  Why four stars? Because silly, when have I ever reviewed something that wasn't worth the price. I don't think that one should go down here for a full meal, it is really expensive and for not AMAZING food. But go with your other, and fully make out by the fire as you watch Good Charlotte on the little LCD TVs that the CRAZILY added. So go, order a ten dollar drink and enjoy the old schoolness that is the Pepper mill.",

We didnt know what hit us, it was like our dreamland come True, except for all the smoke. yuck.  anyhoo, we shared the Fantasia waffle with sour cream (definitely the way to go) and the best biscuits and gravy that we had ever encountered in our entire lives.  The bloody mary would have been delicious if the celery stick wasnt monstrous and made every sip taste like i was actually taking a bite.  sooooo, after our meal we decided to check out the fireside lounge.  The fire pits in a hot tub? could this get any better?  the next day we dragged our tired asses and our friends back to our found treasure for our last meal in town. too bad i was hung over and threw up everything i ate on the way home : (  soooo worth it",

His response was a long pause and then he turned around and asked \"How'd you guys hear about the Peppermill?\"  It's a place that locals and people in the know love and they want to keep it away from the mainstream Las Vegas Crowd.  Pink and blue neon lights, disco ball ceiling and of course the fireplace. It's a place that you would never find in Boston, where I was visiting from. Maybe that's the reason why I loved it, it seemed like a million miles away from anywhere else that I had been.  We sat lounge side and ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was decent, my only complaint was the drinks that we had packed very little punch which was ok, being that it was probably 2:00 PM when we went there. It was still a great place to relax before a big night on the town.  I suggest going there with date. Don't tell her where you are going, just tell her you know a place uptown.",

    "text": "This is not a pleasant review to write, because I've always enjoyed the Fireside lounge, and would go back there in a heartbeat when looking for a nice place to have a drink with friends.  However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit.  The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.  A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.  My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.  My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.  Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.  It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time.",

Perfect place to take someone who has NEVER BEEN there before. Many ohs and ah's, The perfect spot for taking a date or a date on the DL.  It was better w/out the tv's everywhere but its still dope.

Was there about 4 times on my last 2 week trip to Vegas.  The service is excellent, everyone is very friendly, the food is really good and the coffee is great!  But beware, the portion sizes are HUGE!  First time there, my boyfriend and I both ordered omelets and when they arrived we decided that next time we'd split one.  We sat at their counter one day around lunch time and watched what was coming out of the kitchen and couldn't get over the amount of food on each place.  Between the two of us, we've tried their soups, eggs, omelets, wraps, burgers, and steak and not one complaint.  The place has a 70s vibe that initially put me off when we walked in, but as soon as I sat down it started to grow on me.  It's a cute place and, most importantly, it's clean.  We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas.",

This place is kind of famous as it has been shown in several movies and that is about the only thing good I can say about it. Looking at the menu they have a $28.00 dollar porterhouse steak. At 28.00 dollars I figured that it would be of reasonable quality even though we where at what appeared to be a fancy coffee shop, so I ordered the steak and was very disappointed with the quality. It was an 1/8 of an inch thick! Heck, I have had better breakfast steaks and Denny's! The sauteed mushrooms tasted terrible. Basically they were canned mushrooms thrown in oil and warmed up. No flavor what so ever. The baked potato was even bad. It was over cooked and damp tasting like it had been sitting in a steam oven all day. This restaurant managed to strike out on all 3 items that I ordered. Even the drink that I ordered was flat and had no carbonation. I would stay away from this place if you like flavor.",

I felt like I should be in scene from Pulp Fiction.  Once we were seated in our booth (which was vinyl with glitter embedded in it) our waitress promptly got us water and coffee.  The coffee was standard diner stuff.  I ordered pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and sausage which was all very well and good but nothing groundbreaking.  My wife ordered the fruit plate and that is where the magic happened.  This fruit plate was HUGE!!!  So big, in fact, that we took about half of it back to our hotel and ate it with a bagel for the following breakfast the next day.  It had strawberries, kiwi, oranges, apples, cantaloupe, watermelon, and probably other stuff too.

What I didn't foresee was a Hilton, on the strip, with NO bar and NO restaurant. No problem, the Peppermill is just down the street.   My coworker and I drive there to find a mostly empty parking lot, which made us think the place may be low on the popularity scale. However, in Vegas a lot if people walk the strip and inside, the place was full.   I ordered the chicken and red pepper pasta. This dish was recommended by two employees.   I found this dish to be very run-of-the-mill.    The cream cheese stuffed chicken was not outstanding. The cream cheese adversely affected the consistency and \"bite\" of the chicken while I found the red pepper cream sauce to be rather one-dimensional.   The bruschetta appetizer and mixed drinks were very good.   The service was very good and kind of made up for the rather average food offering.  Pros: good service, unusual decor and setting, made up for entree.  Cons: entree a little sub-par",

The lounge is awesome and relaxing, dark and cozy and private, too. Waitress came right over when we sat down by the fire pit (which is a little warm even at 10:30 am in early July in Vegas) so we relocated. No big deal. There are tons of people waiting to eat here and that means it's good! The girls and guys who work here have always been fantastic at what they do. I think our server Crystal has been there for years and was fantastic! I do my best to try something new when I have the pleasure/torture of going on the Strip but still stick with old favorites here. Joe's San Fran special and southern fried steak were so perfect and huge we took the left over deliciousness home. Find a lot of pics of them already so I didn't need to give you more of the same. Last couple of trips here have been for breakfast but in years past lunch/dinner menu items were great as well. Have no fear about your experience at this special place to visit/eat/drink & party in Vegas. Should say 'World Famous' on the sign but I'm pretty sure everyone knows that already.",

I'm glad we did pop in and check them out, because this was a very positive experience.   The decor is much nicer than one would expect from just looking at the outside of the place, and it was full of patrons once you got into the dining area. Because this is Vegas, in addition to the normal waitstaff (busboy, and waitress) they also have cocktail waitresses who stop by your table to take any alcohol orders you might want to place. We went for breakfast, so it was a bit early for me- but hey, it's Vegas! Plenty of people were drinking at 9:30 in the morning.   I had the oatmeal, which comes with a lot of toppings, and bacon. My wife had the two egg breakfast with bacon. We were both pleased with our meals, I will certainly plan on eating here again. They offer everything on their menu 24/7, so you can have breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter time of day you show up. I like that. I like that a lot.   There is a very cool looking bar in the back with some very cool sunken seating areas. It looked very interesting, hopefully next time I come it will be at least noon so I can have a drink with a clear conscience!",

HAHAHA There are actually trees (fake) inside the restaurant, comfy booths and a diner bar.  Our server, Kathleen, was excellent-and from what I overheard-she has been there for years.  We ordered:  -Coffees ($3): Big cups and French Vanilla creamer. Always topped off. -Garden Omelet [custom] ($13) -Lorraine Omelet ($13.20) Total was $40 with tip.  Portions were very generous, and came with a couple sides. I opted for the hash browns and English muffin. I couldn't finish half my entree and I was hungry! Hash browns had a little burnt taste to it, but no biggie - I stuck to my veggie omelet.  There's ample FREE parking in the back, which is convenient given LV. Would recommend coming here at least once. Big ups for it being 24 hours!",

Then the waitress took our food orders. She told us the servings were big and she wasnt lying! Late night and we both ordered breakfast. Everything was amazing. My girlfriend in particular loved her hot chocolate and the already ready sprinkles that they have at every table! She always notices little things like that. After the meal, we paid and went next door to check out the firepit. It's in the bar and lounge area. We sat at the firepit and both had a drink, enjoying the warm fire and the good tunes playing. Looking forward to going back as this is now our favorite late night spot!  -J. Soto",

The mushroom dish that came with the steak was phenomenal.   The Peppermill also has incredibly large portions for the price you pay. If you ask for a side of fries, its in a huge bowl instead of a small plate. Although I did not drink any other their drinks they had a huge drink menu that looked great and all of them came with a scoop of real ice cream. I will have to try it the next time.",

I will not be returning.  After getting our drinks and ordering my daughter's food, I witnessed a cockroach crawl across the table.  The waitress came over as I was standing up to leave, in shock, and I explained that a cockroach came over... my friend brushed it off the table... and I stomped on it.  I pointed to its carcass on the floor.  I was still putting my coat on when a manager came by and asked me to please stay.  She said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.    I was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.  I tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.  Our bill was comped, as it should have been.  Still, I feel someone needs to take a look into this.  Restaurants just can't have cockroaches crawling across tables and still actually think they are clean, can they?",

    "text": "Been coming here since I was a kid. That's 40 years folks. My mom, huge Vegas goer that she was, loved the place.  It's a tradition.  Every Vegas trip includes a meal at The Peppermill.  I don't think it's really changed all that much over the years and that's cool. Same great food, same big portions, same good service, and same ultra tacky Vegas decor.  Awesome.  Versatile. That's what The Peppermill really is. Open 24 hours. So, whether you're dining at the traditional \"breakfast, lunch, dinner\" hours or it's 3:30 am and you have to pool your money with your buddy because you lost big; the place hits.  All of their fare is good. Never have had a bad meal or service here.    I hope I never have to utter the words, \"Remember The Peppermill in Vegas?\"   Go. Trust me.",

I would go back just because it is The Peppermill or for the Fireside Lounge part, but it isn't a place I would write home about. Service was definitely lacking. Our server was very strange and his mind was obviously not on work. Kind of felt bad for the guy.",

    "text": "So, I've been doing business in both these places since before most Yelpers were born (about '86) as well as at the Algiers restaurant and lounge which were immediately to the north.  I chuckle when I see people give this place less than 4 stars because someone didn't honor their existence or because Bobby Flay didn't prepare their meal on their one visit.  This place is remarkable not only for enduring as one of the last of the old Vegas but because the service, portions and quality have all remained consistently high throughout at least the last 30 years.  They've tweaked when conditions necessitate but haven't really changed what they do because what they do is provide great quality and value without caring what trends dictate at the moment.  Pretentious? Go somewhere else.  Got friends and wanna hang?  Try the bar or restaurant, you won't be disappointed.  Hope they stay around another 30+ years  ;-)",

My rating is on the TERRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD:  The service was terrible!! Our waitress Inka was not welcoming! She rarely gave us any attention. She did not ask for our drinks, we had to ask her for the drinks we wanted after our meal came. Fortunately, a waiter passing by gave us water when we first sat down. The food took a good while. I ordered the salmon while my husband along with his brother and girlfriend ordered turkey burgers. The wait was long. The waitress never came by to reassure us of our meal was coming. My order came with a salad and I didn't get it until our entrees were given. My husband's burger was bland. When we got our check, I was supposed to get bread with my meal. We went to pay, I asked the waiter was I charged extra for it because I never received it. She asked who was my waiter. Here comes Inka standing next to her. I repeated the question. Her Response? \"It comes with your meal but I forgot to give it to you.\" There was no sorry or anything. We have never refused to give someone a tip before. She was the first. If you don't like your job, then quit!   The food is expensive and was not worth it. I will not come back again during my next visit in Vegas.",

The Clarion was once the Debbie Reynolds, WWF, Paddle wheel casinos. Now,  it's rubble. Tacos Del gordo was THE PLACE for an arm-sized burrito and super fresh tacos. Now it's an empty store. Further proving that the SLS Is dead wrong by telling us that \"North is the new South \". (that's a truly a DUMB idea. As is the idea of the SLS itself.  Enjoy it now,  I say it's closed by '19) Next month another classic is done. The Riviera sadly closes.  The landscape changes again. Between the quality going down, prices going the other direction and the fact that some of the local residents of the 4-legged variety have been seen nearby.  I wouldn't send anyone to go there.  I used to LOVE the open hearth of the Fireside.  But I have to admit,  I'll never go again.",

The interior feels like a strip club (with it's cheesy pink neon lights) so it's only fitting to come here for breakfast to complete your drunken club nights.  The service here is friendly, but the food is what steals the show.  Not only are the portions huge, but the food is surprisingly very good.  I've only had breakfast items both times I was here, but It's much better quality ingredients and better taste than any other breakfast place or diner I've been.  Both times, I've had a omelete and they were delicious.  I even opted for egg whites which they'll happily substitute for a slight up charge.  I plan on coming back soon to try their salads and dessert-inspired cocktails that they are known for.",

I'm so sick of the staff treating me like a worthless piece of crap, so I'm through with you.  I'm tired of paying 40-50 bucks for a meal where I have to practically beg for someone to refill my iced tea and get snubbed the entire night.  We used to be a great team. I'd stumble in drunk, eat your huge greasy food portions, and then get even more drunk off your overpriced scorpions.  Later you stopped caring about me by always overcooking every meal and then you eventually stopped using seasoning.  Finally, your staff just stopped paying attention to me.   I just feel like you've given up on me, so last night I refused to tip your waitress after being blatantly ignored all evening and having our food shoved in our face which was so bad that I wanted to throw it back at you.  I'm leaving you because you don't contribute anything anymore and you make me hate you.  Good luck, Peppermill, although I know you don't need it.  There are plenty of other tourists, strippers, crackheads, and those down on their luck that you can take advantage of!",

The fireside lounge, well, let's just say, I threw all my clothes in the wash that I was wearing when I sat on those sofas.

    "text": "When my boyfriend and I were in Vegas, we stayed at the Mirage so normally we wouldn't even have ventured this far down the strip. However, our friends were at the Riviera and said they had heard Peppermill was pretty good. So we actually came here twice. The first time was the first night that we were there, and the second time was for breakfast the day before we left. Both times there were a decent amount of people there, but we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.  Service overall left a little to be desired. But I mean, what can you really expect? We only were on the restaurant side, although we heard good things about the lounge side of the place. Definitely a diner type feel to this place and whatever you get, underestimate what you can eat because everything is MASSIVE. Two people could easily split most of their plates.  One time I got the Feta Cheese and Vegetable Omelet, which was huge. It came with an English muffin (or toast or whatever) and potatoes, and I definitely couldn't finish everything. The other time I got the Pancake Combo which included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The pancakes were like 8 inches in diameter! One of our friends just got the pancakes (not combo) and they were literally a foot across. I mean, massive. Everything tasted really good, no complaints about any of the food. This is definitely a legit option for any time of the day (open 24 hours of course) although I have heard that it gets really busy around breakfast/brunch time.",

Ordered the nachos, chicken tenders, and the chicken fried steak and eggs. Nachos are sort of deconstructed. The beans and meat come on the side. They were a huge portion, good amount of cheese. I'd rate them 3, though. I come from a state that has good Mexican food, so they are just ok.  The chicken tenders...you get 4 and they are wide and flat. Big portion. Huge portion of fries come with it. Steak and eggs also good. It's a sausage gravy on the steak...and it's very sausage-y. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Chicken fried steak tasted pre-battered, but still good. Service was good as well. You have 3 servers...one takes your nonalcoholic order, one does alcohol only, and the other takes your food order and refills nonalcoholic bevs. Interesting place. I definitely recommend checking it out!",

So my traveling buddy and I decided to get a early breakfast here after a night of debauchery on the strip. The restaurant had a late 80's Magnum PI type vibe going with the decor. I could dig it. It was cute. We were seated and promptly given menus. I ordered a typical breakfast(scrambled eggs and pancakes, hash browns). My traveling partner ordered  steak, eggs, and hash browns. Our food came out in a timely manner and the portions were more than sufficient, but when I say those were the gummiest eggs I have ever tasted..... babeee, terrible. I really don't want to believe they were powered but those couldn't have been fresh or the hen was past her prime. The pancakes were equally eek and they felt like bricks hitting the bottom of my stomach, just heavy and tasteless no matter how mud I tried to make them edible, I just gave up.  My buddy was a little indisposed( i.e a little hammered), so she actually didn't eat her steak until the next day, but she said it was delicious!. I don't know, maybe I just had a one off night and maybe if I got back, I will give Peppermill another try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.",

The exterior of the building looks rather unassuming aside from the neon \"Peppermill\" sign at the front, but once you walk through those doors you are officially in Vegas. The amount of neon lights is just unreal! The 50's diner/tropical oasis combo is something I am sad to have gone my 25 year life without experiencing. There are flamingos everywhere, and their tableside sugar is rainbow colored! If all of this doesn't scream Vegas to you, then all of the hungover/still partying people dining alongside you will! This was our stop for breakfast before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. Standard breakfast fare, but giant portions! I had the eggs bennie which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy that even a human vacuum like himself could not finish. My dad had the ham and eggs with a slice of ham bigger than his face. The wait staff was really wonderful. Very quick and helpful. Overall, I truly enjoyed dining here and cannot wait to go again!",

This is the place to go if you want a good price, large portion & delicious meal.  Their omelettes have 10 eggs, so this gives you an idea as to how big a portion they serve.  My recommendation if you don't eat a lot, split it.  Also, if there's a waiting time go to the fireside lounge through the glass doors if you're 21+ as you can order cocktails while you wait and the waiting time won't seem so long.",

It can be tough to pull off but with the right group of people, endurance and pacing the best all-nighters end at the Peppermill. There you can get that last drink at the lounge in a neon faux jungle setting, lounging next to a firepit/fountain. Get one one the giant girly drinks like the scorpion, or grab a bloody mary or irish coffee. The pours are good and drinks really round out the night.  Then walk to the attached diner to get a greasy spoon breakfast to ward off that hangover. After it's all said and done it's on to an iconic Vegas moment, a blinking, eye shielding stumble into the morning light to a waiting cab. Rest, recover and go again.",

It was ok, I couldn't eat it. My server was Elisha, she was wonderful and so very helpful and accommodating!! Cool atmosphere and there was no wait when I got here.

I ordered something called the San Jose breakfast bowl, though trough would be more appropriate, it is large and heavy and contains scrambled eggs, sausage, beef, onions, spinach, cheese served over hash browns. It was very tasty, especially the potatoes...I could only finish about 1/3 of it and was not hungry again all day. Interesting staff and nice melange of customers for people watching.",

    "text": "Here is a hidden gem on the Las Vegas Strip. It is on the North end across the street from Circus Circus. It provides excellent food with large portions and a cheap price. The inside is like stepping back into time for a while. They have the typical diner look, but with a Vegas twist. The best part of this place is the lounge in the back.   The Fireside Lounge is a great place to start your night or end your morning. The fountain in the middle of the indoor lounge has fire coming out of it and you sit very comfy couches next to it. If you can't find a spot next to it you can plop down in any booth that is open. They have great prices and great service. I work in the hotel industry and suggest this place to everyone.",

You will recognize it from the movie Casino. Bring some friends and order some Scorpions.",

Diners set a really low bar--as if being greasy and gross is a badge of honor. Imagine my surprise when my side of fruit came out not waterlogged and discolored, but fantastically prepared, fresh, colorful, and beautifully presented!! The strawberries tasted like they came out of a Beatles song. My main entree of country steak, eggs, and hash, was equally perfect. It's fucking cool inside here, as well. Retro neon signs and giant leafy plants decorate your 24 hour breakfast experience.  Tip: Meals are huge and expensive, so splitting is the way to go.",

    "text": "Let's see - a fun and friendly atmosphere, large portions of delicious food, tasty drinks served by a bona fide cocktail waitress, and all at reasonable prices. What's NOT to like?!  Ok, maybe the Vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of Tao and a million Wolfgang Puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. But then again, Peppermill is right across the street from Circus Circus and right next to the Riviera, and away from the worst of the Strip traffic.  My girlfriend and I went to Peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in Las Vegas, always a good sign. Once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts.   We were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. She helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.  My girlfriend got a grasshopper and I tried a Blue Hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. No watering down here, I guess!  For our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while I tried the pastrami burger with (I was delighted to find) curly fries. We finished off with an \"Elegant Brownie,\" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs with just slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.  And the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. Not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.  If you're in Vegas, you owe it to yourself...it may be a little off the main drag, but the Peppermill is well worth the trip. As for us, we'll be back!",

    "text": "Was introduced to this place by a friend and we all decided to check it out as a group for brunch.   Upon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very Vegas indeed. The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.  Since I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day.   My cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try.   My boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill.   Finally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love.   Overall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person.   Great first time experience. I can't wait to see what else Vegas has left for me.",

The bacon and eggs were perfect, though. I also tasted my mom's crab egg's benedict. They were really fishy, but the holondaise sauce was delicious. Next time I will try the corned beef hash. They come highly recommended by my father.",

Kind of feels like dining inside a tropical-themed pinball machine (minus the deafening bells and the giant metal balls that could crush you, that is.)  Service is exceptionally attentive, especially when your drink is empty.  What I LOVED was my pastrami sandwich.  Big and tasty, toasted bread, this sandwich would be right at-home on 6th Avenue in Manhattan. They missed their fifth star with a lackluster Caesar salad, which, in addition to not really being a Caesar salad (DON'T get me started on that topic, almost no one makes a real Caesar salad any more) was also limp and lacking sufficient dressing.  My friend had a Porterhouse that was tasty, cooked to his liking, and priced reasonably.  Free and easily accessible parking, too.  I still love this place.  One of my go-to's in Vegas.",

It's more or less a classic diner, but then in the back there is a fire pit built into the table that we sat at which was different and provided for a beautiful ambiance. Sitting at the table and sipping our drinks was very relaxing and there were many people here on dates or catching up with a friend. The waitresses wore long black dresses which seemed elegant, classic and I thought was interesting. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a chocolate chip martini which was delicious, but I expected it to be a bit more flavorful. My friend ordered a frozen Scooby Doo martini which she did not really enjoy. We shared the appetizer sampler which was huge. It came with breaded chicken, fried shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. The food was OK, nothing too crazy. Best items were the mozzarella sticks and the chicken. After about two pieces of food each, we both began to feel very sick and nauseous so we didn't even finish our food.   Rating this place a four because I thought my drink was good and the atmosphere is just unrivaled and different. Good place to grab a drink and order a lot of food!

He basically ignored us but the hostess did a great job greeting us and getting us our seats. I had the wings and my boyfriend had the Chicken Parmesan. I was pleased but he's a foodie and he wasn't pleased with the noodles on his plate. Overall good experience, we wanted to go back before we left town but didn't make it. Looking to make a trip back though.",

While we were enjoying our drinks a young lady came by and offered to take a complimentary Peppermill souvenir photo for us. It's really cute. You also have the option to buy a larger version. The staff we encountered were all friendly and polite.        The Peppermill is open 24 hours a day, 7 day's a week, so make the time to stop in and enjoy the vibe.",

Probably shouldn't have chosen a Sunday morning to finally come here, but it's my birthday today and I wanted to do it! We walked thru the door and were quoted a 20 minute wait. It was more like 25, but thats okay. It gave us time to take in the place and let our appetite swell.  The inside is very retro(which if you know me at all, you know I LOVE!) They have the purple and pink tubing running all thru the interior, with some artificial trees hanging over the boothes. It was pretty frickin cool! They have TV's set about the place with some screen shots of different locations around the world. This was a bit wierd as it went from Bahamas(sweet!) to weeds in Beatty, Nv (???). Didn't exactly make sense, but still kinda cool.  We are seated in our booth and a guy comes to get our drink order. I order a Sierra Mist and my friend a water. They very promptly bring us 2 waters.lol okay. The waitress chuckled when I told her this and brought out my soda. No harm, no foul. Waitress is very nice and very attentive, which is especially appreciated considering how slammed they are during this time.  I ordered the Masarati Omelette(12.95) and my friend ordered the Peppermill Omelette(also 12.95). Those things were freaking huge! lol They both came with an order of hash browns and toast. Damn, they were really tasty! Mine had ham and musrooms and tons of american and peperjack cheese in it with some Marinara sauce on the top. It was very different from any kind of omelette I had ever tried before and I must say it was scrumptious!   This was such a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try different things on the menu and check out the Fireside Lounge one of these days!  4 solid stars.",

Open 24/7, reasonable prices, HUGE portions--I can only imagine what this place is like at 3am on a Saturday. Standard American diner fare--if you're anything like me, that's a pretty common craving to have. Each pancake probably weighs a solid pound, their omelets are made with TEN eggs, and their hash browns are beautifully crispy and will not leave you wanting anything more. I wouldn't recommend the waffles unless you've really got a craving (you do you), only because they're pretty ordinary in size and taste and don't even come with sides. Their lemon-cranberry muffin is sweet enough to be a dessert on its own!   This place is garish and gaudy and they know it! Flamingo lamp fixtures, neon lights, fake cherry trees, and velvet lined booths. Honestly this place is as fun as it gets!   Come as you are. It's Vegas! No one will judge.",

If you've burned some major calories pulling those slot machine levels then this is the place. Portions are ginormous which is why I assume a lot of people come here. Don't come here for health, come here for pleasure.  Service is hysterical...in a good way! We had a sassy waitress who basically told us what we wanted off the menu and she didn't get anything wrong. Wish I could remember her name but I do remember the food!",

    "text": "The Peppermill has been on my to do list for some time now. So today after a long day of work and being very hungry, I decided to treat my husband to a different restaurant. I have read great reviews and was very excited to experience it for myself.  My husband and I arrived and were greeted and seated in Dilila's section. There was a photographer to take our photo. Also, a cocktail waitress. I thought those were great touched. The menu had a great variety. So I ordered a Primal Burger without egg and my husband ordered a Peppermill Burger both well done. Our food arrived. My fries were perfect!!! Piping Hot and crispy!!! My Burger was another story. So, as I touched the Burger, I noticed the bun was COLD. Like right out of the package cold. So, because I was very hungry and not wanting to wait for it to be remade... I didn't bring it to the attention of our server I didn't enjoy the taste of the burger but, as I mentioned before, I didn't want to be a bother. I look over at my husbands burger and meat was dry without any condiments. So, not wanting to complain we eat and ask for our check. I mention to the server just as a suggestion to let the cook know to warm the buns for the next person. She asked if I wanted my burger remade and I told her no. She said she would talk to her manager. Please keep in mind, the server knows I ate all of my fries and some of my burger. The manager Martha comes to our table. And tells me I ate all of my fries and I am taking my burger with me so she can't do anything. No apologies. Just what she can't do. This was a 15.25 burger and fries and the best part of the meal clearly were the fries. I am astonished by her response to this issue. The server comes back and asked what happened. I explained she didn't do anything. So, I ask to speak to Martha again. She comes over and I explain that she is supposed to resolve issues. And, she continued to tell me she can't do anything because I've eaten all of my fries and I am taking the food with me. So, I say ok...I will leave the burger here. She first says she still can't do anything. So, I say why does me taking the food home matter if you still can't do anything. So, she snaps at me and says she will give me a couple of bucks off. She takes off 5 dollars and throws the receipt back on the table. No apologies.   I didn't want 5.00 off. But, her attitude and body language was so terrible, it's the least she could do for wasting my time. In customer service...there is ALWAYS something you can do. If she had offered the 5.00 when she came to the table or maybe dessert...I wouldn't be typing this review. She says I ate the food. I did. I had a long day at work. Had just gotten blood work done and just wanted to eat a meal with my husband. Didn't want to wait for more food. Before speaking with Martha... I decided my meal wasn't as good as it could have been, but no need to complain about it and have them remake it. But, if I tell them about it... they hopefully won't make the same mistake for the next guest. It seems as though this manager just doesn't care.  So, not wanting to wait any longer, we take our payment to our server. And...Security comes over!!! I wasn't being aggressive or anything. Why did security have to be called?   We will not return. Martha really needs Customer Satisfaction and Soft Skills training. A little care, empathy and concern can go a long way.",

The depressed in flame pit stall in the mixed drink bar is likewise an astounding element anyway we didn't stay there as we were with the kids. You can tell it is all around taken care of and exceptionally perfect. We adored that every one of the tables were stalls which made it extremely social and agreeable. Great structured. We were all around taken care of by the staff and made to feel very invited with the youthful youngsters. The mixed drinks are astonishing, exceptionally suggest the mudslide or chocolate chip treat. The nourishment is awesome, we had different burgers and sandwiches and they were all astounding. The bits were vast! They have an incredible kitchen group, it was extremely occupied and you can see them in the open kitchen, not worried at all and making the most of their employments. We didn't need to sit tight for a table anyway I think we were fortunate on timings since when we went go there was dependably a pause and after we completed there was nevertheless I would 100% say it is certainly justified regardless of the pause, it was an incredible encounter all round and made us feel like we were in Vegas during the 70's!",

Note:  this is a breakfast review (served 24 hours a day) based on 20+ visits.  Come hungry.  1lb flame grilled, bone in ham steak and three eggs and half dinner plate serving of crispy hash browns (or  pile of toast, giant muffin, or entire bagel with cream cheese).  Not enough eggs? add a side of additional three eggs for just $3.95.  Eggs Benedicts with not two but THREE poached eggs atop a split English muffin, a pile of Canadian bacon, buttery hollandaise and those incredible hash browns again.  Giant omelets folded and filled with a wide range of staples from chicken or turkey breast, sausage, or shrimp to artichokes, fresh spinach, peppers and tomatoes all made gooey with  jack, cheddar, provolone, parm, or even feta cheese.  Zero complains.  Greasy spoon French toast made from thick slices of Texas toast quick dipped in a cinnamon, vanilla custardy mixture.  Three eggs, two strips of bacon two link sausages sit alongside.   The carbcakes, errr, pancakes, 14\" giants.  Three golden, fluffy, buttermilk disks that hit the spot.  As a combo, add the two eggs, bacon and sausages.  Go during daylight hours and it will always be crowded.  Tip:  Put your name on the list, and go to the lounge, light up a machine for $20 and play some video poker or keno to pass the time as you enjoy a giant, spicy bloody Mary (lubing the system or hair of the dog).  Don't forget your 10 percent tip for the bartender if you hit.  Very friendly diner service.  Sure, nothing is specially sourced, nothing heirloom or organic, no claims about hormones or non GMO.  Sulfates, nitrates, phosphates abound but so what?  Eggs and bacon always cooked to order (ie over easy, extra crispy).  The great American breakfast, Vegas style lives on.",

It's easy to spend $30 on breakfast and coffee including tip & tax, with no booze. I would argue it's worth it. Try the crab cakes Benedict. Huge portion (3) and some of the best crab cakes I've ever had. On the other hand, Coffee is $3.95. I'm drinking water and going to Starbucks for a latte after. Here's the BEST news: if you're 60+, you can order off the senior/junior menu which hides on the last page of the menu. Regular portion of awesome hashbrowns, one egg, two bacon, one toast, $6.25. The fruit cup was enough for two at $7.50. Good value if you're old like me.",

    "text": "I decided to bring my beautiful lady here. I read this place was one of the top places to go in Vegas. So why wouldn't I bring the love of my life here? She deserves nothing but the best.   We sat down and ordered mimosas and our breakfast. She had the scrambled eggs and turkey snausage. I had the eggs and hash.   What's even better was that I was sitting in the best diner in Las Vegas with the love of my life. Although I didn't love the eggs and corned beef hash I loved the company I was with. It makes me the happiest man on earth when I am with the love of my life. She always has the right things to say, except when I'm right of course. She always has something funny to say, or so she thinks. I find it cute nonetheless. All I know is that my lady makes me so proud and grateful to be the man in her life.  The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge you get 5 stars from me not because it's awesome to see waitresses walking around at 9 o'clock in the morning in ball gowns or because of the cool lighting or even the salty corned beef hash, it's because I cherish every moment with my woman and I got the share this memory with her in your establishment.",

Neon lights in bright colors, Naugahyde booths, artificial vines, huge portions, and a very romantic lounge make this landmark a fun visit.  We sat at the counter yesterday for breakfast, because the restaurant was very busy, and we were really amazed at how much work the waitstaff do.  The area is not very big and it's fun to watch the staff carefully maneuvering around each other.  Portions are very big and the food is always good.  Would highly recommend to locals as well as tourists",

The food is average, but what it lacks in taste it makes up for in portion size.  The food is good,  just not spectacular.  A ton of variety, I've been there several times and don't think I have ever repeated a dish.   The lounge attached to the restaurant is really cool.  Dark circular seating areas make it a great place for cocktails with friends or dates.  The fire pit near the front is cool too, with plasma TVs all around you shouldn't miss any of the game either. There seems to be a good mix of tourist and locals here.  I think when you come across a spot locals keep going back to, you have found a special place that hasn't been totally destroyed by tourists.",

    "text": "If this place doesn't make you think of the swank, bygone days of Vegas where the Rat Pack and the Mob ran the town, nothing will. The interior is romantically dark, but with low, florescent lighting spanning throughout. The mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on. The foliage that envelopes the interior adds a lovely exotic touch. The \"tables\" are actually large, low to the ground coffee tables, surrounded by big, squishy couches pushed back against a wall, so everyone gets their own, private grotto. Shall I even begin to talk about the bubbling blue flame pool that you can sit around? Awesome!!   And let us not forget the drink menu. Typical bars and lounges in Vegas will serve up trendy, funny named drinks where, you have no idea what's in it, but with a name like \"Mouthfuck\", you just HAVE to drink it. Not so at the Fireside. Not only are the cocktails reasonably priced and STRONG, but they're the CLASSIC drinks that you would expect in Vegas. Not only did I recognize all of the drinks on the menu, but there were some drinks that are so classic and vintage that no one my age (25) has ever had them, so they're sort of trendy again. I had my very first Old Fashioned, and then followed that up with my first (of many) Champagne Cocktail. Honestly, Champagne Cocktail is where it's at!!  Then of course is the music. True to old Vegas style, they play Dean, Frank, Sammy, Bing, etc. And then, to appease their younger generation, they play Beyonce, Justin, and whoever else is popular these days. However, the song selection and sound level is hardly offensive; indeed, it's quite mellow and chill, thereby allowing you to suckle upon your champagne cocktail, or other drink of choice, and engage in verbal and social intercourse which might then, if you are lucky, lead to other kinds of intercourse. Really.. this place is friggin awesome.  BTW: The pic above is NOT the lounge... it's the adjacent restaurant",

Sure, it's cheesy and dated but honestly, after all the ostentatious marble and gilt-covered surfaces of places like the Bellagio and Caesar's, it's a nice change. It's dark and funky and relatively quiet after being in noisy casinos all day. We came here for a late night snack so I can't comment on the full dinner experience but what I had was good (not great, but good) and hit the spot. Our waitress was attentive but not overly so and kept the refills coming in a timely fashion.  It wasn't too busy the night we stopped in and we almost had the place to ourselves which makes me think we may have missed out on the full Peppermill experience. Ah well, there are plenty of other opportunities to run into crazy people while in Vegas.",

The place is quite big, didn't need to wait too long to be seated. The biggest positive of Peppermill are the extremely generous portion sizes. Seemed like all the orders are big enough for 2. The service here was good as well. They have such a wide variety of items it hard to decide what you want. Personally, I ordered the Maserati Omelette! The pics on yelp are as advertised. Tasted great, it says it's 3 eggs but it felt more like 4-5 eggs! The food was definitely up to par. Peppermill is a spot that many people know of or rave about so definitely give it a try. Just make sure you're hungry or definitely get ready for a to go box. It's the perfect spot for late night dining and when you have the munchies!",

They also don't allow you to split the check, as we went in a group, so this caused a hindrance at our table until we could move money around to one another to cover our costs.   The food was good, big portions. The feel of the restaurant with the food is just a nice place to go late at night, but I don't know if i'll ever return if I come back to Las Vegas because of the split check situation.

Lots of neon lights, what I would call \"costumes\" for the servers, great older music, and endless people-watching opportunities.  The portions are HUGE and the food is great!  Enough to split an entree.  I usually get some type of breakfast dish because they have some of the best hashbrowns.  Great mimosas and bloody mary's but beware of the up-selling skills of the bar/lounge servers!  Tip: They DO NOT split checks.  I repeat, they DO NOT split checks.  Bring cash or use the ATM there to grab cash if you're with a larger party. Tip: there are dining room servers (funky \"costumes\") and bar/lounge servers (black dresses).  Don't try to order food from the bar/lounge servers or alcoholic beverages from the dining room servers. Tip: The wait can be pretty insane sometimes.  Be prepared to wait; have a drink in the lounge or play some slots to keep yourself occupied. Tip: The place is open 24 hours.  On a bender on the strip and starving?

The cheese was hard and when I mentioned it to the waitress, she said that's how they always are. Hmm...ok. For $17, I would expect the nachos to be delicious.   Most of the time when I come here I get the philly cheesesteak.($12.95) It's exactly what you want when you order food from a place like this, yummy and greasy. lol! It's messy and that is how I like them. A few times I ordered breakfast and it seems like my friends always order breakfast too. It's pretty good, nothing special.

It's not the cheapest place for breakfast on the strip but its gonna cost more than if you go a street over, even though it's kinda in an empty part of the strip.Thinking about it, some of the stuff on the menu is way overpriced but you're paying for the location and atmosphere! If you're a tourist, I would go here! This place has been around for a long time and it has been in a lot of TV shows, so that's kinda fun too.  I almost forgot my favorite thing to order here...the banana split. It's huge and amazing!! You need at least two people to share but you could easily share it with four people. My friend and I have gone there twice just for the banana split!",

We thought we'd give it another try and came out on Fathers Day. The wait was an hr, but w/e. We went to the lounge side which is pretty cool looking to enjoy some drinks while we waited. This place definitely isnt the place if you have any eating restrictions. If ur vegan ur only gettin a salad and some fries out of this place. I had french toast, it was ok, nothing spectacular. My family had omelets, which were huge they couldnt finish them. The best part was the mimosa. This place is just a fancied (aesthetic wise) up american diner.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for about 48 hours visiting some family friends and I had been wanting to go back to the Fireside Lounge. The friends I was with humored me, so we too the trek down to The Strip.   As we were driving up Las Vegas boulevard, I could see the sign for the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. It was a bright beacon on an otherwise gloomy day. The Peppermill used to be my grandma's favorite place to go back in the day, but I digress. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.  We arrived about 3:30ish on Saturday afternoon. We had a 7 p.m. reservation at Rao's so we had time to kill. The room was pretty much empty with the exception of the section of seats that surrounded the fire pit. We found a nice big lounge area and the 3 of us parked ourselves for some drinks. The decor is a trip. Lots of neon and mirrors, but to me, it is old Vegas and with the untimely departure of the Rivera that used to stand next door, old Vegas is hard to hold on to.  Crystal was our server and was prompt at arriving at our table when we sat down. I ordered my usual Maker's Mark Manhattan, and the other two gents with me ordered a Martini and a beer. We enjoyed ourselves for s few hours as Crystal was always stopping by to check on us and make sure our drinks were good. After all was said and done for 3 Martinis, 3 Manhattans, and 2 beers, our total came out to a little over $60 which wasn't bad.   By the time we left at about 5:30, the room started to get busy. The good news is that a younger crowd was coming in and there was enough staff to handle the people coming in. This is the kind of thing that will hopefully keep the Fireside Lounge around for a long time.",

The food was delicious and the location is very convenient if you are staying at the Encore/Wynn or some of the other hotels at the end of the strip.   I had the chicken strips twice and buffalo chicken wrap. Both very tasty! My friends really enjoyed the breakfast, wings, salads as well. Service was alright.  The only thing I didn't like is they have cocktail waitresses who bring alcohol rather than your waiter. The first night we went, we had no problems getting drinks. However, the last day, our waitress kept saying she would send the cocktail waitress but she never came. She finally came when we were almost done with our meal but wasn't really worth it to get a drink then. Not sure if that's always a problem, but it's just a bit odd.",

The restaurant itself inside is, um, unique. But it's the uniqueness that makes it memorable. It's completely dark, and neon, and looks very much like a diner right out of the 1950s. Gaudy decorations, but hey, it's Vegas.   While you wait, enjoy the actual fireside lounge in the bar area. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses are friendly.   As for the food, it's delicious. Usually you don't complain with 24 hour breakfast. Everything is delicious, you won't go wrong here.   If you willing to wait a bit for good old fashioned American food, this is the place to go on the Strip.",

After gathering my belongings I looked up restaurants nearby and yelp recommended The Peppermill. Me and my significant other decided to give it a try.   Upon entering we were happily greeted by a 70's diner like atmosphere. We were promptly seated and had a super happy bubbly waitress who offered us some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. She was on top of her game the entire time!   I ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.) I ordered the peppermill breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and it was excellent. WAY better than a Denny's or chain. The pancakes were thick and hearty. My significant other ordered the salmon and loved it! We ended the night with the brownie and ice cream which was absolutely to die for!   We enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round! We ordered Wings, breakfast food and a sandwich (I can't remember the name) with roast beef, thousand island and a few other things which sort of resembled a reuben. We were completely satisfied with both meals and are going to miss this place when we leave!   If you are looking for amazing food, a great atmosphere, A+ service and a bill that won't leave your pockets empty, I HIGHLY recommend The Peppermill!",

    "text": "What a gem on the strip!  After a failed trip to Tacos El Gordo for a quick bite before we left town Monday morning, we decided to hop over here.  The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.    Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.  Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd.   Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.   My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.  Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.  Service was very friendly and on-par.  Definitely a place to consider if you're nearby and want some good breakfast grub.",

Place was very busy on Sunday morning. We had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. We had crab cake bene and eggs & hash brown. Crab cake was a bit smelly, and was kind a hard to enjoy. Eggs and hash brown were ok.  We also had chicken soup to start with and it was not hot, was warm, flavor was ok. Waffles was served with a corn syrup instead of maple syrup. What a let down. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Expect a huge lineup if you want to swing by Peppermill for brunch! Our party of two had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table - there's plenty of seating in the wait area and the hostess announces your name into a microphone so you'd hear that your table's ready even if you're standing outside.  I felt like I stepped into the past, the retro themed ambiance made the dining experience even more memorable. I still remember my shock at the size of the pancakes when it arrived at the table. So, I thought \"okay, the portion sizes here are impressive\". Then I took a bite and this is hands down the fluffiest pancake I've ever had!   My Maserati Omelette was also enormous - I wouldn't be surprised if they used a whole carton of eggs to make this beauty. It was amazing!   We could not finish out food, and the bill was less than $30 per person after tax and tip! I will definitely stop by Peppermill every time I visit Las Vegas! Highly recommended!",

Absolute waste of money. The salmon was cooked well, but had no flavor, none what so ever. I will never return, and i will express to the people I work with to never visit.  I would love to see Chef Ramsey tear this place apart.  Extremely disappointed. I feel like I got robbed by eating here.. I wanted to walk out and not even pay, it was so bad.

Don't be afraid to accept the free photograph you are offered while you are waiting/eating! It *is* free. You can buy a couple paper frames if you want them. We did! And then gave it to my mom as a souvenir. :) Since we went in for breakfast, on the way out, we went into the bar area just to see the fireplace. Pretty cool!

It seems like on every episode of Holly's World they're hanging at The Peppermill. Unfortunately, she wasn't there when we went. BUT I'm sooooo glad we checked this train-wreck of a restaurant out. It's Denny's on crack.   After going here, I can honestly say I know what being like Lindsey Lohan must feel like. Let me help you imagine this place a little better. Take your average Denny's or IHop, sprinkle in some meth and blow, add some 60 year old ex-strippers, angry foreign tourists, mirrored ceilings, neon lights and a haze from extra-smoky cigarette smoke.  The food is GIANT....you'll feel like you're on an episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse when you get your food. The waitresses look like they hate their life and could give a flying F that you think your ice cream sundae is amazing! (Cheer up ladies....you work in a crazy place!)  If you want an amazing experience and crazy pictures to go along with it....go here. It's my new favorite place in Vegas. The kitsch level is off the charts!",

I took my family there last night who are visiting from out of town as I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere, but after an hour of waiting for two appetizers we ordered and asking where is our food.... We finally received our bill (already charged to my card as they had held it). Right after that we got the cheese plate we had ordered, with blocked cheese that looked like it came from Walmart! and the bbq chicken pizza.... Well it NEVER came, but was charged to my card nonetheless.  I asked to speak with a manager after, but she was rude and could care less, and as a resident of Las Vegas I am very disappointed that they treat my guests like that.  If you want to go here, my advice is this - eat first and bring a flask... You'll need it!",

The food is much better than a Denny's. I had an omelette with spinach, tomato, and feta cheese, which was too big, but delish. Jam tasted homemade and I got fresh fruit on the side instead of hash browns. Loved it.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll hit this place up on the late night to see the show.....",

It's not how surprisingly great the food is, the totally vintage and tacky decor, or the fact that it's open 24 hours.   It's that awesome fireside lounge. If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.  In the restaurant, the girls are dressed like Hooters girls, in the lounge they're dressed like prom queens in full on gowns. With that said, the lounge is NOT fancy, it's just a cool place to drink and be comfortable.  Again, still love the Peppermill and I'll probably come back here every time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying the server, Nellie, was wonderful. The food was very well made as well. Unfortunately, due to the unprofessional and extremely rude attitude of the manager on duty at the time, Peggy, I have to give this establishment 1 star.  While in the restroom, a male employee opened the door and said \"Lady, I have to clean\"  and added something along the lines of telling me to hurry up.   I went up to the host podium and politely asked to speak with a manager. Peggy said that she was the manager, so I told her that I appreciate the fact that they keep their restroom cleans for their guests. However, having a male employee open the door and ask you to hurry up is unsettling and was an unpleasant experience.   Peggy then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't have said that to me because, \"he doesn't even speak English\". I responded by stating he knew enough to stay that. I can excuse the way he said that, knowing that there was in fact a language barrier. That's fine, I am not saying anything poor in regards to his work ethic. It's hard to work somewhere where the predominant language is not your own.   However, to be told he didn't say that to me, is condescending, unprofessional and rude. A manager should never speak that way to a guest and they definitely should not end the conversation, which was civil (I wasn't yelling or making a scene, I was simply telling her it was an off putting encounter), by then walking away without another word.   It wasn't busy. At that time, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. If I was the owner, this woman would never be representing their establishment. Such an unfortunate situation because everything else from the food to the decor was lovely.",

We ordered a scorpion (6 shots are in this shareable drink) Our food arrived quickly. Portions were huge!!! We both ordered steaks. Amazing!  We will defiantly be back.",

Was it bad...no. Would I come back here... absolutely one night when I'm drunk and it's 2am!! It beats Denny's , that's for sure! ps. The Fireside lounge is attached to the restaurant and is only open in the evening. I poked my head in to check it out... very dark, firepits, neon lights...looks like a groovy time!",

It reminded me of some 70's porn like that Mark Walberg flick I can't think of right now. Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean).   We decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw)  I did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool. I kind of wish we sat on that side and enjoyed my bday breakfast but honestly, I just wanted to eat and head out to downtown to gamble.  Overall, it was a cool experience to check out but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Especially when you have so many other cool spots to eat at in Vegas.

The wait time was 30-45 minutes for a group of five people. I believe we waited longer though. The bar inside the restaurant had no wait. But, you could only order appetizers as food entrees. The inside of the restaurant looks like a rave or a strip club.  The neon lighting is pretty epic. The staff was very friendly being that this place was super packed with people waiting inside and outdoors for a table.   The Menu was a little overwhelming -- it had a big selection to choice from. So, what ever your probably craving after a long night of partying.. they probably have it on their menu. Everyone in my group had breakfast entrees... We all seemed to like there crispy hash browns. Oh... Did I mention the colorful sugar on the table? Yes, there sugar for coffee looks like confetti. Super cool and colorful, just like their dining area.",

The Mai Tai tasted like rotten juice. The steak salad was mediocre at best. The brotato appetizer was so bland if I put anymore salt and pepper on it I was certainly headed to the ER. They were willing to replace the brotatoes buy served me a dish equally disgusting. Canned refried beans with what a assume was cheese whiz on top. SMH!! Then refused to take it off the bill stating they were not \"Texas Style Nachos\" (we are from Austin). Horrible Experience. The only positive was a homeless man ate FOOD, not tasty Food but it's a meal. Don't waste your time or money..

Dinner on a Monday evening came with no delay. Being accustomed to making my visits to Las Vegas on the weekend, not having to wait to be seated (at all) was well received. Alfonso was our waiter and I almost want to give him 4 stars for allowing us to eat ourselves delirious.   **Note: don't get the banana split unless you have 3 people to help you eat it.  With this visit only lasting under 24 hours, my wife and I wanted to make the most efficient use of our time, so we made sure the dinner was early enough for us to enjoy while leaving us enough room to return the next morning for breakfast. This time (Tuesday morning) we sat at the counter after being seated at a booth. We didn't have a problem with where we were seated but wanted to enjoy a slightly different experience. What made this restaurant stand out, beyond just having quality food, is the fact that the manager made it a concern of hers to make sure there was nothing wrong with where we were seated. That act alone shows that everyone, including management, is interested in making sure the customer is receiving good customer service from the time they walk through the door. Petra was our waitress and she was very attentive despite the crowd in the restaurant picking up. The quality of our food was consistent with all of our previous visits and I look forward to our next visit.",

Taste just like a chicken quesadilla. No complaints.  Hash Browns: Not as crispy as I wanted it to be. I wouldn't order it as a side next time.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try some more dishes. The omelettes look really good.",

Every member of the staff was friendly and patient. The food was perfect for the moment, yummy stuff. I got the Joes San Fran Special, which was filling and delicious. The prices are just right and the timing of the whole meal was on point. This should be the after after party spot for all club goers! Trust me , read my other reviews, I'm legit. ;) . Done",

The prices reflect that of the Vegas markup too, but you come to expect that on the strip. The first thing that you would notice on the menu would be the breakfast emphasis. I've only done breakfast here and it's rather good, even at 4 am.  -=-Southern fried steak-=- I got this meal with eggs. That's the perfect way to do chicken fried steak. It's definitely top 5 in my list of chicken fried steaks. You just can never go wrong with a fried piece of steak. The gravy that they add on top as well is savory, flavorful, and not too overbearing. If you want something breakfast meaty, and don't mind a huge chicken nugget, get this. I was able to get away with only eating half, and saving the rest for later, so fear not hungry men, this will fill you.",

Expect to wait during busy meal times and check out the fireplace lounge. Also expect to pay Vegas Strip prices on basic plates of diner food.

After hitting up the club all night/morning my boyfriend and I were starving and were willing to settle for a Denny's but our cab driver decided to drop us off at Peppermill because he said the food and atmosphere is better...thank you Mr. Cabbie!   The place is big, very neon, has a full bar, they take pictures at your booth/table, and the service is friendly. I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and it was DELISH!!! Huge portion and plenty of fries. I couldn't finish it all. My bf ordered the Nachos and he was about to order the large size when the waitress advised him to go with the small because it was pretty big. OMG...as the nachos approached the table everyone surrounding us had their jaws wide and I'm sure I saw some drool hit the floor. The small order was BIG and piled high with cheese, chicken, beef, beans, sour cream, salsa...it was too perfect. I tried helping him polish them off but we barely made a dent.  I'm a fan of this restaurant...I would come here anytime :D",

Portions are definitely huge (especially pancakes) but prices reflect that so its not like you're getting some great deal.  Service was pretty slow with long waits to order and to get our food (simple breakfast stuff like french toast and omelets), food coming out at different times, and another wait to get the check.  Food was merely OK.  Our group had french toast (recommended by an employee, but nothing special at all), a fruit plate (very big), oatmeal (pretty good, but $11 for oatmeal?!?!), a caesar salad, and an omelet.    The atmosphere is fine, but not as fun as I thought it might be from the other reviews.    No one was impressed.  Big portions doesn't make up for mediocre food.  Maybe other food is better, but breakfast wasn't.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time in April.  We went to the fireside lounge and I immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own \"wedding\" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there. Peppermill is on my official list of All-time favorite places in the world!!!  Everyone from the wedding still talks about how awesome a choice the Peppermill was!!!",

And the food... restaurants always claim to have \"huge portions.\" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too.   Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a",

Throw in a simple lounge where Crystal is behind the bar blending up Chocolate Chip Cookie milkshake cocktails, I'm with you into the afterlife.  My first visit to Peppermill was in the morning after a long night. The wait is usually an hour plus on a weekend morning, so plan accordingly. In my case, planning accordingly means heading straight to the lounge and ordering a Bloody Mary. I don't want to say that Peppermill served up the best bloody I've had in Vegas so far, but I have to say that because it's True. Not too watery, just the right amount of spice, and that wor-chest-chire sauce, that nobody can really ever spell or say correctly, took it to a whole new level of tomato glory. Once our table was called, we finished our cocktails, grabbed our bucket of Coronas, and had breakfast. Eggs and bacon with an english muffin. Delish with a capital D and my perfect equation for curing a hangover.  My most recent adventure brought me back late night. Crystal was behind the bar again and mixed me up a blended cocktail called the Chocolate Chip Cookie. Heaven, dessert, however you want to describe it, it's darn good. Went for the Rueben at 12:30am and I'm so glad I did. The ratio of meat to sauerkraut was impressive. The last minute addition to order a random drink off the cocktail list based on the name you liked seemed like a great idea at the time. I opted for the Snuggler, a hot chocolate with Rumplemintz, which was tasty but wildly unnecessary at that hour.   Peppermill, I'll see you again real soon.",

The particular experience I'd like to share happened maybe a couple years ago now.  I was sitting eating my meal, when at the table next to me, a man on a motorized scooter came in to be served. He was clearly disabled, as he had difficulty communicating, and had a large word board he used to point at to talk with his waitress.  Having worked in the hospitality industry previously, my heart felt anxious for his server, who if I remember correctly, was named Brenda.  Brenda not only kept patient and calm with this gentleman, but when his food came out, she sat with him, set him up with a cloth to protect his clothing, and spoon fed him his dinner! She stayed with him this way for the remainder of his meal, and helped him clean his face and hands when he was through. Witnessing such human kindness brought warmth to my heart and streams of tears from my eyes. It has left such an impression, that I have found myself retelling that story at least a few times, and am finally remembering to leave a review. Thank you Brenda. Your kind act left a lasting impression on me, and I'm pretty sure that you are living proof that angels walk among us",

This place is a relaxed environment but unique and fun. They have a lounge with a bar and fire pit in back to enjoy while you wait for your table if they are busy. You do not need to make a reservation.   The interior is neon lighting and just a fun 50s old school type of diner feel with Vegas flare.   The food portions are large. Be prepared to share plates or take it to go. I love he blueberry muffins. They have great sandwiches and salads as well. The banana split is definitely enough for two to share.   The pricing is really nice. And you can ask for separate checks. This is a fun place for a first date. There will be a photographer coming around asking if you'd like a photo of your group taken. We usually get one. You can say yes and just get the sample they give you, or buy a photo with a frame.   The parking is plentiful and it's located across Circus Circus Hotel & Casino. The menu is great on variety and the staff is very friendly.    If you want to have a good time and a place to eat and take cool photos, definitely come here.",

Very bitter, didn't even drink it at all. What a waste, horrible customer service as well. Our waiter had an attitude.

Because Vegas.  It's tacky-in-a-fun-way, gaudy-glam, neon, old-style Vegas and I love it. Lots of purples, pinks and turquoise. There can be a wait, depending on when you go, but it's worth it, in my opinion. Quick note-- if you are a person of larger proportion, the booths can be a bit of a squeeze. My ex-husband did NOT care for that when we went.   The food runs pretty much the lines of good diner food, and the portions are HUGE.   There's also a large bar menu, and the Scorpion is a fun fishbowl-sized drink to share. We also had another drink that tasted fantastic-- I swear it was called \"Bathtub\" or \"Bathtime\" something, but I have to apologize-- after that Scorpion, my notes got a liiiiiittle fuzzy.  I CAN, however, tell you the Nachos, Nachos, Nachos were MOUNTAINOUS and very tasty. We opted to add the ground beef and it actually came on top (not on the side as the menu stated) but we didn't care (see aforementioned Scorpion) and enjoyed them immensely.   Oh, and at some point, someone will come and take your picture and then offer to sell you a package, but they always give you a cute little print for free, so that's a nice souvenir. I highly recommend you check this place out. Great place to grab a bite to eat, any time of day.",

    "text": "We were looking to find some breakfast in Vegas and wanted to try out a new establishment.  I had heard that the Peppermill was worth a try.  We decided to take a gamble and a short Lyft ride down the strip.  To best describe this restaurant in a single sentence, I would say it is a double-priced Denny's with slot machines.   We walk in and ask for a table.  There is a 25 minute wait for a table but decide to be sat immediately at the counter in front of the waitress station/kitchen.   Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks never went empty.  We came here for breakfast and their menu had plenty of options.  I couldn't decide on what to get so I asked the waitress what they were known for/what was popular.  She didn't have an exact idea but said people like to get the country fried steak.  I said hey why not and ordered it.  My wife ordered the blueberry pancakes with sausage and bacon.  The food arrived surprisingly fast.  My food looked and tasted average.  The country fried steak looked like a big battered pancake covered in sausage gravy.  It was just too much for me grease-wise.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen I could see all the other customer's food waiting to be delivered and instantly regretted not going with a lunch option.  My sunny side eggs were alright.  My hash browns appeared fresh cut but were soggy.   I tried a bite of my wife's blueberry pancakes and they tasted great.  Fresh blueberries and such.  For her sides, she ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and her meal also came with a side of bacon and sausage.    Overall, the food was pretty average.  The prices were kind of ridiculous.  My cup of coffee was $4.  My country fried steak meal was about $20.  My wife's meal the same price.  Overall, we ended up spending over $50 for meal that might normally run in the $20s range at a similar diner.  I could have eaten at Hash House for cheaper.  Oh well I learned my lesson.  Maybe I missed something.  Maybe I should have ordered lunch.  I just didn't catch the charm that was supposed to make this place special.",

While you wait for your seat, you can play at the slot machines or visit the fireside lounge where you can see the fireplace!  The waiters are friendly, the sugar is fun and colorful, but the food does take a while to come out. But when they do, the portions are quite large!  The New York steak and eggs was ordered at medium rare, but It came out medium. Juicy and tender enough, with pepper sprinkled on top. It comes with a choice of bread, where you can choose muffin or toast. The blueberry muffin was very moist, soft and delicious with some sugar on top.  The turkey dinner (seasonal) was actually very good. It wasn't dry at all. Came with a side of stuffing, cranberry jam, mash potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and some veggies.  We also ordered the Soup salad and bread. The chicken soup tasted fresh but the salad wasn't very fresh, some of the leafs were already starting to brown. You are given the choice of Garlic bread or Rosemary. We went with the garlic bread, and I was happy to see that it had cheese on it.  The Ciabatta pesto burger, was ordered medium but came out well done. Had it been cooked correctly it would have tasted pretty good. Ordered with a side of Onion rings which were on point!  If you're very hungry or looking for something to eat at odd hours, this restaurant will definitely satiate your appetite! But if you're searching for quality, I recommend going elsewhere!",

    "text": "This place has the Wow factor! We've been to Vegas many times and I don't know how we've missed this. We loved it so much we went twice and will definitely make it a place to visit each time. Firstly the decor is fantastic, with its neon lights, indoor trees and stain glass lamp shades. The sunken in fire pit booth in the cocktail bar is also an amazing feature however we didn't sit there as we were with the children. You can tell it is well looked after and very clean. We loved that all the tables were booths which made it really social and comfortable. Very well designed. We were well looked after by the staff and made to feel very welcomed with the young children. The cocktails are amazing, highly recommend the mudslide or chocolate chip cookie. The food is fantastic, we had various burgers and sandwiches and they were all amazing. The portions were large! They have a great kitchen team, it was very busy and you can see them in the open kitchen, not stressed at all and enjoying their jobs. We didn't have to wait for a table however I think we were lucky on timings because when we went passed there was always a wait and after we finished there was but I would 100% say it is well worth the wait, it was a fantastic experience all round and made us feel like we were in Vegas in the 70's!",

I have been here several times to satisfy my LATE night drunkin' hankerings for the best breakfast in Vegas. This was the first time that I actually came during normal business hours for a 10am Saturday breakfast. The food didn't disappoint. However, there were huge crowds that I'm not used to seeing (although it will be almost full at 3am on a Wednesday). There was almost an hour wait for a party of two. The secret here is to look for openings at the kitchen bar. It is first come first served. We put our names on the list and then I immediately noticed that there were two seats open at the bar. We sat down and were able to immediately order. We enjoyed our food and paid our bill while people that were on the list before us were still waiting to be seated. They don't take reservations so if you're coming with a large group on a weekend be prepared for a decent wait.",

Peppermill won't split checks. Are you kidding me? It's 2019. This is Las Vegas. There's no way that it can be considered OK to not split checks. After dropping over $100 on one persons card, the 4 of us had to sit in their lobby and pull out a calculator and figure out how much to Venmo our friend that swiped for the meal.   That cannot be considered an actually OK business move. It was a huge pain and honestly ruined the amazing experience that we had at this restaurant.",

I have to agree, this is a great place if you like kitchy decor and great food. I ordered a simple Denver omelet... was I ever surprised when they brought my breakfast out, it was the size of a small meat loaf. It was a good thing that Nan and I had planned to split it because I would have been hard pressed to have done it justice. And it was delicious! Our dining companions had similar luck with their meal, and they had originally ordered one for each of them.   Did I mention the kitchy decor? It just screamed 50s, Elvis and vinyl upholstery. If I had more time I would have liked to have photographed the place, but if I had all I would have gotten was pictures of people eating magnificently huge meals. The line to get in got longer and longer as we worked thru our meals.   This is an iconic spot with good food, generous portions and great service. Don't miss it.",

Lo and behold, this joint had a burger topped with pastrami and cheese, and was sure I had somehow fallen into a hangover dream where my fantasy would soon be shocked back into reality with some shitty meat atop my dry gross burger - BUT it was not. Win! Win! This sandwhich has made a footprint in my mind and I will have it everytime I visit Vegas...I will fly to Vegas for this sandwich. It was INSANE and I can only try to duplicate it at home. If only I could find a man who appreciated the pastrami burger as much as myself, my life would be complete. oooh, my mouth just watered.

The other reviews are correct when they describe the atmosphere.  Purple, red and pink neon lights the place dimly while pretty big cherry blossom trees stick out of the floor up to the ceilings.  The booths are pretty much all circular in shape and are soft and plush.  I ordered the Ranchero Omlette and wow was it big.  Brianna L ordered the cheese quesadillas and we could've easily split either of these dishes.  Both were excellent in presentation and taste.  I had a Tequila Sunset and Brianna had a big blue drink that was pretty tasty.  Cool place that isnt new Vegas-y at all.  Friendly young women waitresses was the cherry on top for this great place to eat.",

The menu sports 10-egg omelettes and a 22-oz milkshake. I thought the Peppermill had an excellent selection of food. While not unique, the menu was extensive and has all the staples. The food was good and the prices were quite reasonable for Las Vegas. It's definitely a Vegas must-do.",

The theme in there is so tropical...with the flamingos, silk trees, and waiters/waitresses with Hawaiian shirts and dresses on...",

With all of the great places to eat in this town I eat there , at least, 3 times per visit. The food is great and you get plenty of it. The country fried steak is the best I have ever had and is almost too big to finish. Beverages are served by attractive women in long black gowns and one of our servers was good looking enough that I wanted to order a case one beer at a time. The lounge portion is ultra cool and definatly designed for couples with a fire fountian in the middle of a booth....yes it was in the movie Casino! I usually stay at The Riv which makes it staggering...uhhh walking distance on those late night early mornings.If you have never been try it because you can't say you have been to Vegas without hitting The Peppermill.",

They make the waitresses wear these awful, ugly uniforms (it reminds me of the flair Jennifer Aniston had to put up with in Office Space).  We went here for breakfast, and it wasn't actually okay.  The omelettes and pancakes were both good.  And for breakfast, it is a little different food and atmosphere than you get in the buffets on the mostly Disney-fied Las Vegas strip.",

Even though I'm a native of Seattle and have only been to Vegas 4 times, I've made it a point to stop at the Peppermill for late night grub and insanely strong drinks in the Fireside Lounge every single time I've visited since my 21st birthday (oh so many moon ago).  On my last trip to Vegas this past December I got to introduce a whole posse of Vegas virgins to the neon splendor and faux cherry tree glory that is the Peppermill.    Vegas is not cheap anymore, Vegas is very hip now and gone are many of the old cheezy Vegas landmarks that us out-of-towners tend to associate with this fair city, except the Peppermill.  This place is the platonic ideal of Vegas and I hope it stays.  To echo some other reviews: insane portions to soak up alchohol? Check. Pretty hostesses? Check.  Unpretentious atomosphere? Check.  Strong drinks in a great setting? Check.    Go while you still can before it turns in to some new mega resort that welcomes only the very rich and very beautiful.",

The service was quick and friendly, and our drinks were always kept full to the brim. Bonus points for the huge cups of coffee (at least by diner standards) and the shakers of multi-colored granulated sugar. I think everyone in our group had breakfast food and concurred that while the egg dishes were on the so-so side, the tasty hash browns and liberal portions of toast/bagels/muffins negated that.  This is an excellent place to get some good, reasonably priced diner food that didn't come from a Denny's.",

Like most touristy joints, they had a decent looking blonde walking about taking overpriced pictures.  She was very friendly and made the experience for my friend (out-of-towner) fun.  The sugar jar entertained us.. you can just pour it on the table and have fun.  We drew lots of shapes and took lots of pictures.  None of them are PG enough for Yelp.  All in all, I'll be back.. It's close to the strip and makes for a great place to take friends from out of town.   The fact that it's open 24/7 helps for those late night cravings.",

It's edible.  You won't get food poisoning.  Good drunk food alternative to Denny's.  Worth the trip even if it's out of the way.",

    "text": "This is the diner that all other diners aspire to be when they grow up.  That being said, The Peppermill is a must-see/do for anyone, Vegas native or not. I genuinely believe that this place has got to at least be a contender for top five diners in the U.S.!  The first time I ever came here, as soon as I walked through the door, I gasped in delight. I couldn't help myself. This is the prettiest diner you have ever seen!!! It's so beautius. The faux foliage with lights, the neon, the dim lighting... It all works so well together, and creates an overall classic retro, yet modernized feel. They have these cool flat screen TVs on the wall at one booth that flash to different scenes around the world. Really nifty to watch while you wait for your food. This place is maybe where say, a pimp might bring his bottom bit*h out for a semi-classy meal at 3am. I mean that in a good way, seriously.  If you have read the other reviews, then you already know: This is the place to come for some after-bar people watching. They get all kinds up in these parts. But everyone is so soothed by the wonderful interior ambiance and happily munching away at num nums that the times I have been there, I have not seen the typical drunk and angry bickering here.  The food is more expensive than your usual diner fare, but it's worth it. Not only is it all pretty much delicious, but you get large portion sizes too. I also love that you are serviced by the waitresses from the Fireside Lounge at your table, so if you wanna keep boozin' it up, that option is open to you.  Speaking of waitresses, all the ladies who work in the diner are wearing the cutest outfits!! I almost considered temporarily getting a job there, jut to get the outfit!  I have never actually been to the Fireside Lounge part, but it seems like a must-do thing the next time I stop by. I can't wait!",

The drinks were not very strong at all. We also ordered the fruit & cheese plate($8), which was just cubed up block swiss & cheddar, grapes, a piece of pear and a cup of nuts + about 6 crackers. It was alright, but I could throw a way better cheese plate together with 8 bux, no problem. The reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of the 2 is the ambience & atmosphere. I love the comfy seating & the fireplace. It's SUPER dimly lit, which I love. Overall, I most likely will not be returning on my next trip to Vegas as the stage door has way stronger/cheaper cocktails & is pretty much the same thing, without all the fancy seating.",

Eggs were cooked perfect for him, he likes his eggs over hard and everywhere else he orders them like that he gets them with the yolk still runny. Not here, they cooked them well and perfect.

Very eclectic decor. We sat in a booth.   I had the Pastrami Cheeseburger. A burger with pastrami added. It had the word \"YUM\" at the end of its description and I was sold. You have a choice of a side so I had the onion rings. The burger was definitely good. Very filling to say the least. I couldn't finish my yummy onion rings. They were so crispy just how I like it! I also had their Kiss My Cucumber drink with Hendrick's Gin. A refreshing drink.   Service was good. Lots of parking.",

We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome.   Families were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas.   Their eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by \"super-solid\" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns.   An honorable mention goes out to the coffee! Smooth, awesome diner coffee.   Also, this place doesn't look like it's changed much over the years, and really, that's part of its charm.",

The ambiance of this restaurant is actually pretty cool the neon lights late at night make it seem really cool inside and out.

From the start we waited what seemed like forever just to have our waiter, yes a waiter. Not waitress and I think this is where their downfall was. He didn't come over to say hi welcome or take an order until almost 20 minutes into us being seated. Red flag right there! We ordered and waited again. I don't know how long it was sitting at the counter before he picked it up but food was only mildly hot, so not fresh at all. He asked if we need anything I said yes we want some ranch and mayo. He wanted to stand there and tell me that I don't need it because they put mayo on it already. Hmmm I looked at him and told him again mayo and ranch yet again. He said ok and walked off. It took almost 10 minutes for that, ridiculous. Ok so we ate and like I said food is delicious and the portions are huge but just a heads up you do pay a lot to have big portions. Nothing under $10 in this diner. So we were ready to leave and our waiter was nowhere to be found and this went on for 30 minutes. No drink refill, no checking on customers, nothing! Finally he emerges from GOD knows where and we just ask for a box and our check. I was happy just to leave. It was such a poor experience this time I was very disappointed. Won't be back for a while.",

We ordered bottled water and they brought us tap water and then bottled water too. The food around us looked good with large portions. But we got a pathetically small burnt burger on hard stale toast with a cup of spoiled mayonnaise. When we told the waitress this is not what we ordered she argued with us instead of trying to make it right. No one tried to make it right.  Also there was sticky pee on the bathroom floor.",

We got there before most of Vegas woke up (10am) and therefore missed a massive line but still had to wait about 15 minutes.

I was expecting to enter a world straight outta \"Boogie Nights\" or something, but what I got was a decor that looked decidely more \"Scarface\" than \"Casino\". The tacky blue neon lighting and faux foliage made me feel like I was stuck in the 80's. I kept expecting our waitress to bring out a complimentary mountain of \"booga suga\" just to get the feast off to a rockin' start.   The food here was adequate in quality and price. I got the chicken foccacia sandwich with fruit salad. The sandwich was a heavy meal, due in no small part to the bread, so I opted to ditch the carbs and mow down on the avocado and breast a la carte. The fruit \"salad\" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That's like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain't.  I think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I'm not sure why we didn't. Perhaps we were clouded in our thinking after such a filling meal. Alcohol is pointless on such a full stomach; it does nothing but further my bloat. Still, this was a blast from the past and well worth our time to check out.",

I wasn't sure what to order at first but, then I decided on a caprese sandwich with french fries. I also ordered a pineapple and strawberry mimosa; now that was the shiiiiiz. The sandwich was packed with pesto, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The bread was a nice toasty, crusty ciabatta full of flavor; nice and chewy too. I also tried some of my friend's buffalo wings! That was so delicious. The chicken wings and drumsticks were super meaty and not like those tiny ones you might get at other places. The ranch was good and didn't taste like it came straight out the bottle. I definitely need to go back to try the rest of the menu. I thought the decor was cute and kitschy.  Bright neon lights with cute trees inside the restaurant. It was a very 1960s super groovy, swinging good time! Seven thumbs up~",

When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds True with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant.  You instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it.  The service was on spot and great!! Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you're in the Vegas area. Great for pre/post parties or even being the main attraction.  Here's my advice to the Peppermill owners- Keep up the great job and don't change a thing!!!",

I love this place, in actuality, especially as a last stop on a night that's gone on a little too long when the weather's a little too chilly.  At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.  The blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)  The Peppermill is really the only place worth lounging at for a local on the Strip anymore, so let's keep it on the downlow and keep the tourists away, shall we?  Shhhhh!",

Interesting and totally Vegas!  What will make me come back again and again:  Southern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!!   French Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right!   Marinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).  Dined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.. Fast service, follow-ups.. I like the Feel and Atmosphere, much different the norm. Prices are alright, they pile on the food and quality is there. I'm hooked on their Southern Fried Steak and Eggs!!! and  Hash Browns!",

    "text": "I had one of the best meals of my life at the Peppermill Restaurant.  I was staying with a friend at the Riviera during RollerCon 2011, and after a day chock full of roller derby, we were exhausted and starving. We headed over to this restaurant that was close to our hotel, and after a short wait we were seated in this kitschy wonderland. There were so many things on the menu that sounded delicious that it took me awhile to decide what to order. I ended up choosing the french toast ambrosia, and it....was....AMAZING. When I read \"topped with seasonal fruit\", I thought there would be a few strawberries or something on top of my french toast. No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.  Our server was very nice and tolerated my friend (who always insists on modifying her menu items). We left a really generous tip.   Considering most of the food in Vegas is expensive and crappy, this place is a MUST. I would definitely go here again the next time I am in Vegas.",

Wait staff isn't always the friendliest, and last time we were there, they totally messed up our order, leaving us with mostly cold food because of having to fix the order.  OK, AND ON TOP OF THAT - they charge you for EVERY REFILL.  EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.  I was even charged for a whole other cup of coffee when I just asked to top off my cup to make the coffee hot again. So, what... ? They put in less then a 1/4 of a pour and charge me for a whole cup of coffee?  I don't think so. I have no desire to go back there again.  But...  The Lounge - cool vibe, the food seems to be better when it served back there (still can't figure that out) and the drinks are REALLY REALLY good.  We like to go to the Lounge with friends, especially ones from out of town.    Skip the restaurant, go to Denny's instead.  Seriously.  The restaurant isn't all it's cracked up to be.",

Not having visited before, and not having checked the Yelp reviews in advance (what can I say? we were on vacation!) I didn't know what to expect. We stopped in for some cold beers and an afternoon snack. We ordered the nachos, topped with beef. What we received was something the size of a small planet: a mountain of multi-colored chips topped with delicious beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, olives sour cream, guacamole. It was fabulous. And our snack was big enough that we didn't need dinner, and had plenty left to snack on all evening.  So we came back the next day, (why wouldn't we?), for a real dinner. We split a quesadilla and a steak and mushroom salad. Again, generously portioned and delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Mushrooms, and blue cheese topped the salad and they were delicious. The quesadilla had a fresh pico on the inside and it was phenomenal.  You must try this place. And don't forget, you will be experiencing True Hollywood glamour: a scene from \"Casino\" was filmed here!",

Once you get inside other reviews called it a Denny's wannabe while others compare the decorating to a cruise ship. I think both of those descriptions are appropriate, only in a very positive way. Our server came to the table right away. She took our drink orders and answered questions about the menu. The couple we went with had there before. They warned us about the size of the portions and so we decided to share a salad. Boy that was enough. We had the steak salad. They prepared the steak perfectly. Volume of food was huge. We certainly did not leave hungry. I would recommend this restaurant for an informal meal at a very reasonable price. Don't expect anything fancy. But the food is good and I will plan to go back again.",

That being said, if you want to get a group in there at a specific time, be sure to get a reservation in advance.  There's plenty of counter \"diner style\" seating if you're on your own or a couple, though, so walking in might work.  I've eaten here so many I times  over the years I've lost count :)  Great to be able to get breakfast all day!  Nothing like getti g up at 5 PM after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.  Large.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  Nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  Hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the fish and chips (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).  Definately a handy spot even if it IS on the far end of the strip.",

The place  has lots of neon and plush seats, very beautiful. The place  was very crowed  with a 45 minute wait. Took  a quick  peek into their  fireside lounge. wow was it amazing looking with very beautiful fire pits. Pictures on here do not do it justice. Finally get seated. Did  not  care for them serving Pepsi over coke (thanks to the drink  server for making it a point to me). We were a party of 3. I went for the Philly cheese steak and onion rings. When it arrived i was in aww at it's size. It look amazing and it was. Generous portions of steak covered I'm melted cheese and pepers. Wife got the foccacia chicken  sandwich also with onion rings. It also looked amazing. She really enjoyed it. My brother got the country fried  steak with mashed pots and veggies, also came with a hearty chicken noodle  soup. He also enjoyed it. Service was good. Now for price, ie say a bit in the high side  but not  for what you get. Price are similar to claim jumpers. All in all this will be our  new go to spot, when in town. Yum yum",

The decor makes me think of a 1970's airport lounge.Its very retro, fun, and casual.  There is always a wait, if you don't appreciate that, get over yourself and go somewhere else.   It always seems to be a madhouse and the wait staff is always busy. Be patient.   I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)  The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)  I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like \"one dimensional\" Whats that about? Someone else said \"over priced\" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.  The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.  The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not.",

Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.",

Came back last week for some breakfast before our flight back to San Diego...Great variety on the menu still, huge portions as usual and good fast food with good friendly service. Had the blueberry pancakes, too much to finish, hubby had eggs and turkey sausage....good job, how about smaller portions with appropriate costs next time....we had no room for doggy bags on this trip.",

Very purple.  I think the servers outfits are awesome. I really like the long velvet gowns the cocktail servers wear. The price seemed high for this place.  Fettuccine Alfredo $20.  We decided to share and got the nachos as starters.  The food arrived and we were shocked, the portions were huge!  We invited two more friends. The nachos were basic, made with real cheese, olives, jalapenos. It also came with a side of beans and the canned type cheese mixed together.  I probably would not order it again.  The fettuccine was surprisingly good.  Added a little pepper then it was better.   It also came with a Caesar salad which was fine and two pieces  of garlic bread.  The 4 of us didn't even finish all the food!  At the end we waited forever not realizing we pay at the front. The server never mentioned it.  I took a peek at the bar and it looked really cozy with a fire pit.  Seems like a cool place to have a drink.",

My lemonade tasted like dirty dish water, the waitress never brought us anymore coffee after we asked and for okay food it was not worth the price at all. I can handle okay food if the service was good, but it was terrible. I am huge on customer service and yes I understand it was busy, but I am a server as well and whether I'm slammed with tables or just having a shit night, I still make sure to check on my customers and this dud did nothing. We came here thinking it would be good because it's always busy and the menu had classics on it. I ordered the ciabatta pesto burger and it was slop. No flavor and a mess and fell apart with a soggy bun. Nope. I won't return.",

I came with my ex back in 2012 and we wanted to get a decent steak for our anniversary but it was around 2am so the majority of the high end steak places were closed. I was pretty excited when I saw a steak place that was open 24 hours. We rolled into Peppermill thinking it would be a quiet fireside grill. And we got Miami vice meets old school Vegas party diner. To be honest I was not very happy. Once I got over not getting what I expected we had a really good time. The food was great, the wait staff was on point, and the atmosphere was super fun. I have been several times since. I went last weekend and I had the same experience as usual. The waitresses are incredibly sweet. One of them was even helping a patron eat that had some sort of muscular dystrophy. It really warmed my heart to see that. Overall an amazing fun place to get some good food.",

I love the banks of TVs (only time I will ever say this).  The entrancing scenes are filmed all over the world. By the end of your meal, you have viewed beautiful footage from Alaska, China, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Hawaii, and Paris. The wait staff is friendly and there is usually a photographer willing to help you capture a special dinner with out-of-town guests. I'm a local,and this is a great place to meet up with people. The food is good with generous portions and well-presented for the diner set-up. This come-as-you-are establishment won't break your budget either.  Don't eat too much of your ten-egg omelet or delish reuben, or there will be not room for a specialty frou-frou drink at the cozy Fireside Lounge. Their drink menu offers concoctions of every color of the rainbow. The Peppermill can get crazy-busy and they are a little stingy with their colorful napkins.  Overall, a fun, unique place. Hope you're hungry!",

The inside is a Vegas style diner where every table I saw was a booth The waitresses are dressed old school cheerleader style and they're very nice  It just feels clean and fresh for a diner I didn't expect that  Now to the food ; the portions are out of control huge  But most of all it's fresh food not Denny's IHOP BS I highly recommend the French toast ambrosia, hash browns Lemon blueberry muffins, Chicken fried steak or any dessert The food is great diner food triple d worthy  This place is very underrated in my book with so many  Ridiculously Horrible Fake ass 4 star restaurant on yelp like  Bistro pizza who's 4.5 stars but Settlebellos is 4 what a joke   If Bistro is 4.5 so is chuckie cheese  or Ventano Italian where they serve Chef Boyardee or Hanks in Gvr which is lame station casino Buffett food Designed  as fine dining station casino \"Where we Hate locals\"  Ok let me stop and count to 10 before I call out all you wack ass  Wannabe restaurants on yelp   The mill that is pepper is a ideal place to take your fat uncle  Or any other fat relatives you have  Take your drunk buddies or a late night date  But don't take anyone with a small appetite not the right spot for quitters",

Everything is good here...the ranch dressing is the very best ever. The corn beef hash & eggs is probably my favorite thing to order and the hot fudge sundae & banana split never disappoints. This place is perfection and we usually choose it over pretty much anything. The menu can satisfy anyone no matter what you're in the mood for.

Crazy colors and wait staff dressed in old school uniforms, it's definitely a place to check out at least once if you're in Vegas.  This place does an all day breakfast, and their portions are serious.  The ham steak is literally the size of a large dinner plate, and they grill it so that it gets some great flavor!  Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.  Overall, fun place to go, whether for food, drinks, or just the atmosphere.",

The portions are crazy big..even the coffee is served in a huge mug! THUMBS UP for french vanilla creamer!  I think the first customer was the jolly green giant and they just never changed the portion sizes!  The waiter was super cool and nice. I forgot his name..\"sorry cool dude\", but he was telling us jokes and gave us advice on ordering one meal for two. That was very nice of him because he was soooooo right!  My husband decided to make up his own alcoholic beverage that didnt have a name so the bartender was nice enough to come to our table and treat him like VIP mixing his drink the way he wanted..so either she came because she was super nice like the waiter or she wanted to get a look at the weirdo (aka my husband) that didnt know the name of the drink he was thinking of! haha  Anyway. We had a full family mixed with adults and kids and everybody was very nice to us. Got our food fast (I think about 9 of us total and our food was ready in about 20-25mins) We all were pleased and fat at the end of the visit.   It was clean. great atmosphere. tasty food. good drinks.GREAT prices We LOVED the fake trees inside and the confetti crystal sugar shaker that I....I mean somebody thought about stealing.  I think this is the only place we will eat next time!  Enjoyed my visit on 12/24/2010",

The hostess was friendly upon entering. And once seated took our drink orders rather quickly. The prices werent bad at all. And the food portions OMG. Ate at around 3 and i didnt not eat again all night besides little snacks here and there. Plus they come around and take your pictures and you can buy it if you want. Sure why not did the touristy thing for once. I shall be back Peppermill. MUAH.",

Kicking back in the lounge, the fellow patrons are a real example of one side of Vegas. I can't hold too much against the place, but watching what had to be the most awkward romantic failures was somewhere between unbearable and utterly amusing.  The cocktails are another story. The Singapore Sling was fairly average. Some people might appreciate that, but I consider it a sin. Their gimlet tasted like drinking pure sweetened lime juice. The cocktails weren't horrifyingly expensive, but they were so weak and unimpressive that it just fell apart. The waitress was nice. Second star for her and the atmosphere.",

You won't be too disappointed by the MASSIVE portions.  I mean, pancakes larger than a frisbee (but luckily very soft and fluffy).  But beware, these portions can't really be finished unless you're a serious eating machine (or you're sharing one meal with, like, four people), and you will pay for them.  VERY expensive for what's essentially \"diner\" food.  For the experience, I think it's worth it once.   I like that the cocktail waitresses come by almost right after you sit down to see if you want spirits from the Fireside lounge.  The service is hit or miss.  For instance, if you say you need a \"minute\" to review the menu, be prepared to wait a lifetime for the server to come back.    There is a photographer that comes by to take a free souvenir photo of your party.  We got it one time and the last time we went, we were gone before they came back to give it to us.    Let the bright lights draw you in; enjoy the over-the-top decor and a decent meal.",

I like that when looking at the menu, I'm reminded a bit of home with the typical diner menu choices as opposed to all of the fancy restaurant menus on the strip.  We had a sampler appetizer of some sort that came with fried shrimp, onion rings and mozzerella sticks. Everything was pretty good.  For my entree, I ordered the Ruben, which was huge and overflowing with fries. Just as everyone says, the portions are large. The Ruben was good. The Cheesesteak was also really good.  Also had the Brownie Sundae which was yum and the Coffee was great.   Really sweet and attentive waitress.   I had an overall good experience with this place. Good food, good portions, good prices and good service. I don't know if I'd really go out of the way to go to this place though. The food is just average.

She was rude and not customer service oriented when I had brought visiting family members in for dinner this evening. After spending a hefty bill bringing in a party of 8. To start one meal was about 20 min late to the table after everyone else had received their entree. Which was fine when the waitress returned several times and insisted the meal would be right out. At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did. With the way we were treated management at the Peppermill can count on never getting another referral from myself of my staff in the future! #somuchforalasvegasgem  #managmentneedstraining  #peppermilllasvegasnotcustomeroriented  #nickelanddimeyou #badboss #badbusiness",

It wasn't the finest of dining, but it was good food and the service was decent.  My Blue Hawaiian tasted like Kool Aid and the cocktail waitress even warned me that it wasn't going to be a strong drink. WTF.

Most of the tables are jumbo sized booths that could fit a family of 10...it nearly swallowed the two of us whole.  The whole atmosphere in the restaurant was very fun and retro.  Based on the jumbo sized portions other Yelpers mentioned, probably to match their jumbo sized booths, the hubby and I shared.  I ordered a small Spinach Salad and he went with the Maserati Omelet.    While we waited for our food, a photographer came around offering \"free\" pictures.  She came back during our meal with our free postcard picture souvenir and a sales pitch for the larger prints.  It's a nice effort, but a picture in a booth with a window in the background doesn't do it for me...especially for nearly $20 a print!  But I gladly took the freebie.  The omelet was HUGE and served with hashbrowns and an English muffin; the salad was normal sized.  So it was just the right amount of food for the two of us to share.  The omelet was an Italian take eggs filled with sausage, cheese and mushrooms and topped with Italian meat sauce and Parmesan.  It was super fluffy, flavorful and really good.  The spinach salad was okay, it was topped with bacon and hard boiled eggs.",

    "text": "Despite a long walk from where we were staying, Peppermill was quite the epic feast with Kathleen W. and the birthday girl Ina S. + bf Alex P.  When first entering, I could hear the \"Awws\" from the girls as they noted the neon lights, blossoming trees, and ambience inside. Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.  Ended up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:  -Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn't enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese  -Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm  -Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.  -Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake  Super filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.  *Note: Apparently if we would have told them it was our friend's b-day, we would have gotten a pretty large sundae, but we had difficulty moving ourselves afterwards, so probably a good idea that we didn't let that go to waste by telling them :P",

Parking was a breeze, since they have a private lot. The menu was huge. I had some kind of taco omelet (can't remember it's name exactly), with hashbrowns and a blueberry muffin. Everything was delicious, especially that muffin. My uncle had the Peppermill Omelet with hasbrowns and a muffin, which he said was delicious.   Service was fast and friendly. The ambience was...unique and fun. Overall, we would return to this place and recommend it to others.",

You can hang out in the sunken lounge if you want, that was kind of neat, and the drinks were good.  The dining area is a zoo, very busy.  That was my only critique; the waitress was so busy, our water glasses never got refilled.  The food was great and the portions were huge, think almost Hash House A-Go-Go big.  My omelet was the size of a football, and my buddy's pancakes were the size of a large plate.  Cocktail waitresses roam the floor as well, so drinks are available.  If you are on the north part of the strip, definitely stop by.",

Everyone went away happy, will definitely be back.  Since the initial review we went there for lunch. I had the Reuben with Onion Rings. The Onion Rings were excellent, big, sweet onions with a very good batter. The Reuben was good as well. My wife had a chicken sandwich that she was pleased with and fruit, which was very good. Sometimes fruit can be iffy, melons especially. This fruit was all ripe and sweet. A nice lunch",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years! I love the tacky blue and pink Vegas Style diner with its maze-like booths and extensive menu.  The portions are huge and the rainbow-colored sugar is a great novelty.  The Fireside Lounge is a great relax place with the same perfectly tacky old Vegas set up.  It's open 24-hours too, so that's a plus.  I chose 3 stars because, though the portions are large, the food is just okay.  I can't say anything here has ever Wow-ed me as far as food was concerned.  Furthermore, I don't believe I have ever received really good service on the dining side.  Most of the time, the servers are disinterested and not really that hospitable.  You food will come out when they have time to bring it and they will bring refills, side sauces, napkins, etc. when they can, but don't expect extra added niceties or say a local joint or service based restaurant.   However, in the lounge, I have had some great experiences with friendly bartenders and servers (with the long black dresses on).",

Cuisine is classic American which suits most ppl and cant go wrong here.  I really dont know why, but they have separate waiters handling food and drinks. It may be due to the fact that the drinks are handled from the connecting lounge area, but thats just a guess.  If you want a different dining option compared to the regular strip choices, go here to start it off or why not end it?",

I'm a big fan of classic places that have lots of nostalgia. This one fit the bill perfectly. The wife and I split a couple 64oz Scorpions while I had Munch's Breakfast and she had a BLT.  All 14 people there loved the food and nobody was able to eat their entire plate.   We retired to the Lounge for a Mai Tai or two and had a great time. Best of all, my Dad said it was just how he remembered it from over 30 years ago. I'd return in a heartbeat.",

I love the whole cheesy, neon night club atmosphere thing going on, I love the big over portioned drinks as well as food and I love the fact that it brings back so many fond memories of the days in Vegas and also memories of other Peppermills I have visited over the years.  I came here recently for breakfast on my little Vegas getaway and immediately felt a comforting sensation as I entered in through the doors. I was immediate greeted by an exceptionally friendly hostess and seated promptly.  I ordered a sausage, Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.  As always, the peppermill way, my omelet was GYNORMOUSE and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that I'm not into hash browns.  The bar area is fantabulous!!! Dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. It  definitely is something worth checking out! You haven't fully experienced Vegas to the fullest with out stopping here; really, you just have to make this a destination point!! Can't wait tell my next visit!!!",

From strippers, cocktail waitresses, and impersonators - to high rollers and Hunter S. Thompson types.  The Fireside Lounge is what makes Peppermill so star worthy though, like a den out of the Elvis Era, you're transported- cheesiness is overlooked, romance is rampant and we're getting trashed on Buttery Nipples; all among floral fakery, a fire pit, and fuchsia flamingos.

The waitresses are still wearing shiny nylons, but they are a lot younger than I remember, which is definitely a good thing. The food is good, the portion sizes are GIANT and you could easily order breakfast and share it with another friend or significant other.   The service here was very good. Coffee cups were never empty, our waitress checked with us numerous times throughout the meal and they even had a cute gal come around and take your picture, which obviously means she comes back 12 minutes later while you have hash browns and eggs all over yourself asking \"Wanna buy your photos? 2 for $29.99 or one for $14.50.\") That's not such a bargain hun.  Peppermill is a much better option that the hotel buffet, which at the Wynn (where we always stay) would have been roughly $35 a piece.",

Skip your hotel coffee shop and head over here. The food is great. Portion sizes are enormous. I am quite the eater and it didnt look like I barely made a dent in my scramble.  The Peppermill is the perfect place to go for breakfast if you have been up all night. Perhaps hungover. You need some good food? This is the ultimate Vegas eatery.",

My husband ordered the beef kabobs, son ordered turkey burger w/sweet potato fries, sister ordered fettuccine with side of fruit, and I ordered eggs, hash browns and biscuits with gravy. Everyone said that the food they ordered was really good and my eggs were cooked perfectly. The service was exceptional! They went above and beyond to accommodate me with a knee scooter (ankle surgery). We visit Vegas for an annual race and will definitely go back! Great food, service and cool decor!",

It was our God-sister's birthday on that day and when asked if there's anything special, she said we can get the cake & she or the rest will sing it. We rather sing to here ourselves. The food came about 50 mins later without the garlic bread that was supposed to be there together. When we called for the manager to at least feedback to her what had happened, she said \"what will make us happy\"? So I said, comp the birthday girl's food. She did not do that but gave us 20% off. Anyway, we will not be back there again. :-(.",

Big portions, 100% Columbian coffee, and lots of stick-to-your-ribs choices make it great for breakfast or that post-drunk meal.  As others have noted - the decor rocks.

I had the Marco pollo omelette, my wife had the eggs benny and we barely touched the massive serving of hash browns that accompanied both dishes. Service was very friendly from the lounge to our server to the cashier. Will make this a regular Vegas stop.",

    "text": "On our way out of Vegas on Monday morning, we decided to check out the Peppermill which some friends had told us about. For a Monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. Wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. We weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.  The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.  My husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.  We were a tad disappointed in the food, but I guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent.",

But in my head, I can't put black lights and Hawaiian themes together, so it just feels really strange. I couldn't feel calm in the place if you gave me 3 shots of whisky and a valium. The cocktail servers in the lounge wear long evening gowns, and the restaurants servers where strange teensy server shorts with aloha shorts. It's just very very strange.

It is in these areas that the Peppermill will knock your socks off.   The portions are huge and although the place is super packed 24/7, the quality of food is still very good. My eggs (over easy), were cooked perfectly, my chicken fried steak was crispy, warm and had just the right amount of gravy, and my hash browns were golden brown and delicious.

More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great.   If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool.   I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare.   The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group.   Some of my best nights have ended here.

I was so unimpressed.   BFF and I drove into Vegas at 5am on a Thursday. So yes, we were stone cold sober, which I think was the problem. I can completely understand how, if you might have had one or nine cocktails, you would think the Peppermill was the shit. With bright neon lights, ginormous portions, and pretty quick service, it is a drinkers dream. I was charmed by the fake cherry trees and our friendly waitress.  Our food, however, was gross. I had the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce, simply put. It was gray and was more like gravy. My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce.   For our two meals and two sodas, it was $36. Way too much for such a lackluster meal. I gotta admit, it hurt my heart a lil to know that my Anthony and so many Yelpers could be occasionally wrong.",

I got Eggs Benedict (was pretty good), husband got Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, which he didn't come close to finishing - said it was not that great.  Atmosphere was SUPER COOL, service was ok and food was ok.  I'll give it another try next time we're in Vegas, and will definitely check out the Fireside Lounge.",

All in all a good breakfast @ a great price.",

But what keeps me coming back is the classic greasy american diner grub in a only in Vegas atmosphere! i.e. bright tacky florescent lighting, flamingos, and the familiar pink Vegas lighting glow!   I usually stick with the classic diner grub, i.e. burgers, sandwiches, and egg dishes. Portions are decent, flavor is what you'd expect from this type of place. The Pastrami is very nicely done! The rings and fries are no joke either! Food is way better than a large portion of the 24/7 cafes in most of the casinos.   The service is very friendly and professional! I usually ask what they would recommend, the responses have always been pretty good! At least the servers know which of  their food taste good!    Drinks are served by ladies in an evening dress! With those coming out of the \"Fireplace\" bar! Usually a pretty funny scene with all the drunks coming in and out of the bar area!  Classic!  Eat, Drink, and be Merry!",

Faux trees at every turn and little twinkling lights (or maybe that was just the effect of the cocktails) and comfy sofa's to plop down on and enjoy your drinks. They also serve a selection of appetizers in the lounge, so it is one of the few places left in town where one can enjoy decent cocktails, good appetizers and a smoke all at the same time.  The food served in the front of the house is always excellent (for a coffee shop) and generous portions.  I have always found the service to be friendly and prompt, although sometimes slow in the lounge.    Everyone should visit this place before they die!!!",

Neon lights.  Crushed purple velvet.  Mirrors. Vintage waitress outfits.   Worries left at the door.  Yuppp, this place is da bomb.  Our friends who are locals brought us here, and good thing they did because I never would have found it, even though I Yelp and read Chowhound extensively.  Actually we walked by it a few times (we stayed at the Hilton about a block away) and I did wonder what the story was with the place...there is something so non-descript and mysterious about it.  Curiosity solved - we came for breakfast on Sunday morning, whole place is packed with a crowd waiting at the slot machines. Wait doesn't take long though. Look around and everyone is drinking  Bloody Marys.  I had the Tequila Sunset and French Toast with fruit and boysenberry syrup - delish! My husband had the chorizo eggs with refried beans, also very good.  Overall, Peppermill is a great diner and the quintessential Vegas experience.  I'll definitely be coming back here on future trips to Sin City.",

I wont lie, the price on the meal is a bit expensive, but what isn't in Vegas, eh?  You get portions, my friend, portions to end all hunger. The breakfast is wonderful. The food is amazingly delicious. The only poor experienced Ive had here was when I couldn't eat my food one night after I had drank WAYYYYYYYY  to much, not your fault Peppermill, that was all me.

That was fantastic. Then we ordered food and literally nothing was good. Totally inedible. So, my advice stick to drinks.

    "text": "Have to say, great 24 hour diner. My cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but I'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so I left them in the room & went exploring. We were staying at Circus Circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out I decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. Now, I'm not into gambling but I figured I'm in Vegas so I might as well do a little bit of gambling. Within 5 minutes of sitting down I won over $20 on a slot machine so I decided I would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. I didn't see anything at Circus Circus that fit the bill so I went out walking and within a few blocks saw The Peppermill. I figured that was the place.  It was pretty much packed so I sat at the counter. After looking the menu over I quickly decided on the New York Strip & eggs. The place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. I ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an English muffin. The waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.  Everything came out as ordered. The 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but I found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. I found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. The steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. Eggs were spot on sunny side up. Hash browns crispy. Everything was exactly what I was wanting in a late night dinner. Adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, I paid & left satisfied.",

We arrived at around 8:30am on a Thursday and were immediately seated. Our waitress showed up within 30 seconds and took our drink orders. When she returned with our drinks we ordered our food and it was at our table within 10 minutes.   The food was so very good, the coffee and the service were both excellent. We will definitely be returning again.",

(Check out photos) It was a colorful atmosphere, full of flowers, neon lights, blue colors, kind of retro. Service kind of sucked--didn't come by to check up, and all of our waters needed to be refilled badly.   One of the waitresses was walking around asking tables if they wanted a FREE picture. Well, always remember that nothing in life is free! Our table said sure, took our picture, came back with the print out (looked really good) said it was $15 individual, or $10 each for two. Umm...no thanks!   Other than that sketchy picture scam, food was yummy, you will leave feeling stuffed to the max. My advice is to SHARE! (Shared a hamburger with fries with my bf, and both of us were full of only half a hamburger) The banana split literally needs 4+ people to help finish it all.",

Get away from the strip casino restaurants and try the Peppermill. Be sure to also try the attached fireside lounge before or after your meal. It is different too. And good. You will want to come back to both the restaurant and lounge again. Give it a try. Enjoy!",

I had an Tostada omelette.  I didn't realize they are 10 egg omelettes. It came with a mound of hash browns and a bagel.  I couldn't eat it all, and my friend had Eggs Benedict.  I sampled and the  Hollandaise was exceptional.  The price was really affordable and you can see that the place is really loved by the locals.",

I asked for the meat sauce and the spaghetti sauce was spicy, I'm sure most kids don't want spicy food. The manager came and said yeah the sauce is kinda spicy so it was barely even eaten and I looked confuse because what restaurant feed kids spicy food. I told them to take the food cause my baby didn't want to eat it but I will still pay for it but they insisted that I don't have to pay for it. Then they came back rushing us out asking if we want a to go box, when we were still eating and drinking, how rude is that !! Our server was talking to her boyfriend a table just right in front of us and I have to try to get her attention every time we needed something. But the manager at that time was kind of pushing us to leave which was rude.",

I read his review, then I saw Terri's and Sheila's, and many other friends' reviews...so, this established restaurant rose to the top of my list of places to go to in Las Vegas!.  The neon sign is a landmark.  The free parking is a blessing.  The interior is unique. There's a pink and purple magical glow that welcomes everyone!  On one side, the lounge features a fire pit!  The other side is a cool dining area with pink flamingos decorating the lamps!  Mel, Terri, Sheila, Dear Daniel, Minky, and I sat together in a cozy booth.  The menu has such variety that everyone got a chance to order something they liked.  Mel's omelette consisted of ten (10) eggs!!!  Yes!  TEN!  OMG!  That's why there's a ketchup happy smile on his plate!  Whoa!  I got the Grilled salmon which came with a side Caesar Salad. Yummy!  The cooked veggies were a bit well done, but I appreciated the healthy boost!   Friends always make my meals taste good!  I thank you for joining me at dinner and look forward to our next foodie adventure!  Note: next time, I will make sure I get something that uses the special colorful sugar that they are known for!",

I think that this should be a MUST go to, especially if you are new in town. Food and service is great.",

We met our friends in town for breakfast.  At 9:30AM, there was already a line.  But they had gotten there at 9:20AM and we were seated shortly after. All of the servers played with our friends' toddler.  It was sweet of them to give the baby attention.  Orders were taken and then the speciality cocktails came around.  Everything came out fast and pretty tasty.  The crab cake Benedict I ordered came with super crispy hash browns.  The hash browns just needed some extra seasoning.  The French Toast Ambrosia was gorgeous and huge!  Tons of fruit and whipped cream with giant slices of French toast. We had a great leisurely breakfast with our friends before going our separate ways. I I would love to come back to try the famous Fireside Lounge.",

Get your photo taken maybe something will materialize but you'll at least get a cool momento for what seems like nobody's first choice for Vegas activities. 3AM feels like 3PM because everyone is lively and you literally can't tell the difference.  Portions are plentiful. I ordered a reuben because of craving a good sandwich. This was a good sandwich and honestly it was twice as big as I was looking for. (Still ate it all)   I would highly recommend this as a change of pace in Vegas. A must try.",

    "text": "This is a well-known restaurant, so it is disappointing, as locals, when we go in on a Saturday evening and realize there are far too many issues in comparison to other places. I will say this: if you are an alcohol drinker, this is the place for you! The service for alcohol is outstanding. Despite us not drinking, we had a waitress in a beautiful gown come to our table at least every five minutes to ask if we need any alcohol! The customer service: ok. We had a nice waitress who was as attentive as she could be, which was limited. The next waitress that relieved her of her shift was nice but also very busy. Are they short staffed? I would want to know as that would explain why the service is slow and not that good. We ordered diet Pepsi's and had to ask for them at least four times before they were delivered to us. I ordered a turkey burger which comes with sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were really good and the turkey burger was OK and it was well done. My friend ordered the Peppermill burger and there are a few issues to mention: she ordered it medium. When it got to the table, along with my turkey burger, it was rare to the point where it might as well have had legs because it could run! My friend mentioned it being rare and they were very polite about it and said it should take no more than five minutes for another burger to come to the table. Five minutes turned into 20 minutes! Not cool. Here I am eating my turkey burger while my friend is waiting for her burger. They came by the table at least twice to explain the first time that they were putting the cheese on the burger and the second time that they were waiting for the fries. The burger was good when she got it but it still had some areas that were rare when she asked for medium! The fries were just OK. We also added French onion soup to the order for another $3.50. They were good but deconstructed as the bread and cheese were at the bottom of the bowl.  I have a hard time figuring out if I want to go back here again. Currently I would not go back. This is not the first time that I have been here and have experienced very disappointing customer service. There are other places that are way better and, honestly, for a bill of $50 including tax, for two burgers and two diet Pepsi's, we were less than impressed when we realized we could do a better job at home cooking these and making better food.  Therefore, I am not recommending this place and I will be trying other venues when I feel like going out and not cooking.",

We were celebrating a birthday but no free birthday dessert. Our waitress said that if we BOUGHT a dessert the wait staff would sing Happy Birthday. That's the part we were trying to avoid. Overall this place is 2-3 Stars. Don't go out of your way for this place. Honestly don't know how this place gets 5/5 stars from some.",

Want to do so and feel transported into a different louder time? The peppermill has unbeatable ambiance! Never change!!!   We waited on the bar/lounge area for our table. Nearly every nook has its own flat screens. Drinks are reasonable and well made!   Once our table was ready we were greeted by a friendly waiter, Jorge. I had a vegetarian omelet with pancakes, DELICIOUS and my friend had Eggs Benedict... Most important for me.... coffee was hot and kept coming! Even the manager stopped by the table to check in!   Next time I'm in Vegas ill skip the casinos and head here! Velvety retro... very fancy, slightly gaudy,  slightly classy, quintessential Las Vegas",

The lounge was extremely Smokey (more than your average vegas establishment) which I cannot stand but I can't complain about it as I am in vegas. Another stand out was the drinks and service. Server ladies are very sweet and accommodating and the cocktails were fun and delicious (if you love sweet cocktails like me) I would definitely come back here and try the food next time as there was a pretty long wait for food even though it was around 1am when we were there.",

    "text": "It's a tradition of course.  And there will be lines.  We arrived around 8:30 on a weekday and - still a 30-minute wait for a table for 4.  It's as old school as it gets.  You can easily imagine mobsters and movie stars mingling around here a few decades ago, drinking large colorful cocktails and oversized martinis.  Which is exactly why I've wanted to go here forever.    While the food was pretty good, it's all a little too much for the morning.  It's too much food (way too much).  It's too much to have cocktail waitresses pushing drinks in sexy costumes in the early am.  And after a while, all the tacky and gaudy eventually got to me and I just wanted to get somewhere I didn't suspect the same air has been circulating for the last 45 years.  The Flintstones-sized food: Biscuits and gravy for my niece - in a bowl as big as her head A piece of ham steak for my brother - larger than his head and requiring two hands to lift the plate A side of scrambled eggs with cheese for me - I really only wanted one egg as I like a light breakfast...  but their \"side order of egg\" is actually THREE eggs.   A spinach omelet for my SIL that looked great but was also ginormous.  Look, everything was good.  It's just TOO TOO much --  unless you're planning on going from breakfast right back to bed (and maybe that's your plan - I don't judge).  We had a full day of sightseeing planned and there is just no way you can even make a dent in these portions and expect to be ambulatory right after.   Trying to order \"light\" doesn't work either - they are determined to feed you until you cannot move at the Peppermill.  I felt bad about all the food waste --  normally I take food home and make several meals out of it, but that isn't practical when you're sightseeing all day and staying in a hotel.    Oh, and there is someone that comes around and tries to take your picture.  This is one of the most annoying things a restaurant can do.    All this abundance doesn't come cheap.   Breakfast for 4 with coffees/sodas was over $70 before tip.  If you really need to be in a food coma, this is a way to do it.   Or split an omelet and that giant ham steak with the entire table and still be able to walk after your meal.",

The menu is bountiful in choices and its safe to say there's something for everyone. Portions are very large and can usually be shared, and for such large portions are worth the price.  If you're in Vegas, add this place to your list! Call ahead to see if there's a wait & if there is, order to go! The food is comforting and always hits the spot. I always order the buffalo chicken wrap & highly recommend! Served with curly fries or regular fries, you can't go wrong either way. Can't forget to mention the generous sides of ranch!",

    "text": "This is the gaudy, neon-covered lounge of my dreams. I was in town for business on Valentine's Day and looking for a spot to drink a brightly colored cocktail on a velvet couch with my queen of a coworker, Taylor S. The Peppermill came recommended by a few trusted Yelpers and I'm so glad we gave it a go!  Everything screams Vegas at the Peppermill--from the colorful neon sign outside to the outrageous cocktail menu, it's all just so fun. We found ourselves a couch in the fire lounge which was surprisingly not crazy busy for a holiday. Our server was dressed to the nines in an evening gown and was super sweet. I ordered a Blue Hawaiian cocktail which honestly wasn't that good, but the bright blue hue totally fit the vibe. They've got some super indulgent drinks with thing like whipped cream and chocolate chip cookies in them if you're into that sort of thing--you can also get a solid dirty martini (according to Ms Taylor).   The lounge only serves apps, so we ordered a giant plate of nachos to split. It comes with a side of refried beans doused in some sort of fake cheese. The nachos weren't the best ever (I'm seeing a trend here), but they got the job done and the portion was enormous for the price. There was also a lady onsite taking photos and giving out a free print in celebration of Vday. You could also buy extras for like $20, but I loved my free little souvenir.   All in all this place is cheesy (in more than one way) and amazing. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Sin City!",

For a diner, the food is pretty good. Just remember, this is not the Bellagio. This is about the nicest diner food I think I have had. Portions were huge, prices were reasonable, and there is quite a wide variety of foods to try. Chicken was kind of tough, but that is somewhat expected of a diner.  I think a visit is in order simply to support a piece of vegas history. However, after you visit you might not be surprised why Vegas has redecorated since the Peppermill first opened.",

Instead, he brought us to Peppermill, a throwback diner with a strip club feel. When we walked in, I couldn't decide if I was looking at a scene from National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation or a Tarantino film.  The decor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.  The food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table. It was sugary (red, white, blue pellets) and left a candy like floaties in my coffee. I kept waiting for the hallucinations to start, but ultimately no harm done.   Overall, it's nothing spectacular, but I love finding new spots and taking in the local color (neon and all). Worth a stop if you're hungry and  on that end of the strip.",

Mostly I was turned off by the customer experience during my first and only trip there. We approached the counter where the hostess were hanging out, and were not greeted. I had to make awkward eye contact in order to get noticed. Lots of gossiping from the hostess and the overfilled entry made my boyfriend and I head to the bar. Drinks were made with no gusto, and none of the bartenders knew of any specials and referred me to the manager to figure that one out. Hello, it's Super Bowl Sunday on the strip, know your business better. Fast forward a half hour later, sitting down and were asked by waitress if we needed more time, and for the sake of time we ordered promptly. There were so many loud groups and fluorescent lighting I would not recommend for an intimate nor family setting. After our check was brought, I inquired whether I could pay with the waitress, she said okay and walked away. -__- If you're in the area I would try it on a not so busy day. If you're traveling more than 4 miles, avoid and head to a decent restaurant where even if it's busy, customer satisfaction will not be sacrificed.",

The wait time on a Saturday morning was 1.5 hrs but you can always grab a drink fireside while you wait. Service here was friendly and everyone seemed to help each other out. They are known for their large portions, especially the pancakes. Food was great and mimosas were huge. Prices were fair. I'll be back next time.",

Service was slow and when the waitress did come around she would go MIA after the drink order was put in and when we asked for some of their honey peanuts (which we never got). I also had to flag down multiple people to ask why the waitress never brought back my debit card when I gave it to her 20 minutes prior. Only when they tracked the waitress down was my card processed. Also, I highly recommend paying with cash, as they placed a $34.50 hold on my card, for god knows whatever reason, that didn't fall off until the following WEDNESDAY (5 Days) after my initial visit. I can understand if I had asked to leave the tab open, but I had them close it out immediately. There was no notice or warning that they put holds on cards. The drinks and food are good. Portions are HUGE. The waitress on the diner side was very nice and fast.  Would I come back? Sure, but I'm going to bring cash.",

The lounge is super cool, I could hang out all day. Our name was called in about 15 min. From there, service was prompt and orderly. I got the pita sandwich with a $1.00 upgrade to sweet potato fries as my side. Came with 2 pita sandwiches! So I had dinner for later. My boyfriend got breakfast with scrambled eggs. The missing star is because the scrambled eggs were not good, unappetizing. His plate came with sausages and they were delectable. I was very impressed. Will make sure to visit this 24-hour establishment every trip to Vegas.",

The inside looks like an aged diner, but without good diner food.  The service was okay (although a little odd as we had to order our drinks from a different server than the food).  Overall the food was mediocre.  There was a lot of it (maybe that's what get's people to rate it higher).  However, you're in Vegas and I would have expected more from a 4 star place.  Honestly, hit a buffet at one of the better casinos and you'd enjoy the food there more.",

We arrived for breakfast and they told us it was a 45 minute wait which is fine because it gave us the option to think whether or not we could wait or go somewhere else. We figured it would be 45-1hr and decided to wait. There were 4 of us plus an infant and the place was packed there's only 5 chairs to sit in and wait so you can imagine how there were people waiting everywhere. We stood against the wall for 55 minutes and I decided to go up to the host and ask how much longer. She told us it would be another 45 minutes. This is not ok. I told her we had already been waiting an hour and she explained she was sorry but there was a table of 20 waiting before us. That's fine however it's better to tell people ahead of time when they check in, that way we can make the decision of whether or not we want to wait. This is the second time this has happened to us. I saw the list she had written down it was one hour wait so I explained it was actually a 2 hour wait and she should inform people to give them a heads up. The only reason I gave two stars was because the times I have been here (about 4) the food has been great. The service is always ok, nothing awesome. I really like the tacky decor it's old school Vegas.",

We ordered Peppemill martini and Creamsicle that was good and taste like orange cream icecream :) for food Buffalo wings that was tasty and crispy and Brushetta which was ok.   The reason for 3 stars are the place was too smoky and they played country music and sports so basically a country's sports bar which doesn't suit the ambience.

One is the Fireside Lounge, which has a wonderful 80s retro vibe to it, especially with the lighting.  The restaurant side is where I went, though.  The menu is pretty typical of a lot of the 24 hour diner options -- an expansive menu of appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts.  My French Dip was excellent especially with swiss cheese and mushrooms, both of which were extra.  The service was very typical of the Strip -- very attentive and a team of staff as opposed to one specific waiter.  By far, one of my favorite dining options and a rare remnant of the old school Vegas.",

Their Chicken and Red Pepper pasta is phenomenal, if you decide to eat at the restaurant side. The decoration is super cute and the staff outfits are as well. The graveyard manager is so sweet!!  We decided to try the breakfast yesterday, 1/7/18. We got there at around 10:30, there was no line at the front booth, we walked in at the same time as another couple. We were not greeted by the THREE people that were standing at the booth, talking among themselves. We stood there for a minute without them even acknowledging or the other couple that came after us. We told them we would like a table for two and they did not respond all they did is look down to see if there was a table for us and told us to follow one of the two young ladies .  Our server did not come to our table. We asked somebody else who was walking by for some drinks......at least 30 minutes past and our server still had not taken our order. There was a table next to us full of people who arrived at least 15 minutes after us and they had already received their food.  We told one of the servers that we were ready to order and they told us that they would get our server. They did. Her name was Amanda and she never smiled. We made our order and after that she only came back twice. One included her coming to give us the check.  We decided to pay at the front with the cashier. She also never smiled!!!! Didn't even tell us or any of the other people that paid before us to have a nice day.   I think the morning staff needs customer service classes. Starting with those that are supposed to greet us, those who serve us and the cashier.  It was very disappointing. We will definitely not go back for breakfast..the late staff is much nicer. But we will be back for dinner and possibly drinks at the lounge.",

The manager ended up coming and helping with taking our order which made everything worse because she was terrible and rude, the most unprofessional person working there, couldn't explain anything on the menu.  Most plates were sent back for being cold and undercooked. Our bill came with extra charges, was a hassle trying to adjust it because the manager, Peggy, was just outrageously rude. I wouldn't recommend going here.",

Two glasses were chipped and one had the sharp chip inside with the ice.  Thank God she didn't swallow it!  What was suppose to be a great night...a disaster:(. So bummed.",

Instead of spending 50 for some eggs on the strip, come try this place !",

We all shared a stack of pancakes and to be honest it felt a little flat to me. It was tough and just didn't hit the spot for me, although they were large and looked delicious.",

But on this night, the service was so horrible, we almost got up and left!  And it was only about 10pm, early for this 24/7 place. We got seated, and then watched two other tables get seated after us and orders taken, before the same server came over to us.  She apologized and said she didn't see us there.  Then we ordered three different sandwiches, nothing fancy.  She brought each sandwich out separately, and spaced enough that one person finished their food before the third person ever got theirs. We insisted that the first person eat their sandwich otherwise it would get cold. My fries were ice cold.  I had to finally flag down any server to complain.  It took too long for our server to come back over and ask what was up.  She then explained that they were busy and I should be patient.  Not what you say to hungry customers. I'm not sure I would waste my time going back here as there are sooooo many other choices in this time.  I'm sad to say The Peppermill with not be my \"go to\" place again.",

Bigger than Lake Mead.  The service?  DeNiro would blush.  The ambience?  A neon chic vibe that zipped me back to 1957.  Peppermill is the ultimate Sin City jackpot.",

I miss my local Peppermill that was in Cupertino (right by Apple), so it's always a bit nostalgic to come in and see.   The place is just a snazzy, super Vegas diner, with quick service. There was a bit of a wait, but you can go into the lounge for a cocktail while you'r waiting for a table. I had a mimosa, and my friend had a very awesome Bloody Mary. Nice 'n spicy.  I had the corned beef hash. It was good. The portion was ginormous. I had it for an early morning snack the next morning (thank goodness for the kitchenettes in the Trump!)  All the details of this place are super fun. There's colored sugar in the sugar dispenser. There's fun neon. There's fake trees. What more can you ask for when in Vegas?",

Some of the other things my group ordered included the corned beef hash (probably everyone's favorite), eggs Benedict, and some other things that didn't stand out.

I pieced together my meal, side of scrambled eggs, side of hash browns and a fruit platter. Portions were ridiculous. The eggs were freshly scrambled, the potatoes nice and crisp. A bottle of cholula on the table makes me happy, who needs tabasco?!?  Friends all loved their meals. Giant stuffed feta cheese omelets and a big bowl of what looked to be everything in the kitchen scrambled and topped with fried eggs. I heard the bran muffin was pretty tasty as well.

They also have a firepit with sofas surrounding it.  Very relaxing and nice to take a date or friends to share a \"fishbowl\" sized drink. 21 and over on the fireside section and only appetizers.

I had read somewhere that they were known for their pina coladas. We sat in the Fireside lounge side of the place. The ambience truly does lend itself to a great place to make out... Dark, with comfy couches, coffee tables and indoor fire pits, and waitresses that wear long black gowns with a slit up to the thigh. And the pina coladas were really good, too. I couple years later, I was on a girls weekend, and we went to The Peppermill for breakfast. Huge portions, and nobody gives you the stink eye when you order a bloody mary with your omlet--it is Vegas, afterall. I had a veggie omlet, and it was awesome. Bloody marys were DELICIOUS, and I'm kinda picky about bloody marys.",

I feel bad for the waitresses and them having to wear the outfits they're forced to wear but when you see the rest of the place you'll understand that it all fits.    There are more mirrors and neon lights INSIDE this place than in probably all of the rest of Vegas combined.  It's fairly quiet so you can usually get a decent booth.    Be warned that the portions are ridiculously large.  That goes especially for their desert sundaes which I never understand why I order because I never finish the entire thing.    It's not overly priced in my opinion but the location is sort of a bit difficult to make if you're not driving since it's halfway between the strip and the old downtown with not much else around it.",

    "text": "I really don't get the hype over this place.  My wife and I went here for breakfast at about 10am because of the outstanding reviews.  It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).  First, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.  But that was where the good points ended.   I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of \"meat\" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.  I'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).  I can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:  a. rating service only. b. into \"all you can eat\" style dining. c. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.  Sorry, but it was big waste of time and money.  You're much better off finding a greasy-spoon off the strip and eating something tastier, cheaper, and MUCH quicker.",

We split the corned beef hash which we asked for crispy and it was awesome!  Our waiter also let us order just one pancake which was huge and those two items were plenty for two women to split.  There was a guy going around taking photos at the tables and at first I thought, \"Heck no!\", but he was really nice and not pushy for us to purchase.  The decor is kind of funny, but I would highly suggest you go here for breakfast.  It's open 24 hours by the way.",

As we were three big guys, we ate at the cafe` bar. We didn't want to try squeezing into a booth. The server was friendly, fun, and knowledgeable about all the food. She even brought out one of the cooks to answer a question from the 'caveman diva' of our group (no, that was not me).   My NY strip steak was really good. The shrimp scampi was okay (which is the reason they didn't get five stars). The meatball soup was great! Probably because it tasted very similar to the version I make at home. The other two people in my group also thought the food was good...including the caveman. The menu selection is huge! As much as I wanted dessert, I declined as I was stuffed.  We ate on the restaurant side and I plan to go back to visit the lounge side.   I would definitely come back here again!",

She opens with a line that really describes it perfectly.  \"If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge.\"  Well, I did wanna feel like Sharon Stone in \"Casino\" and just so happened to be dawning my fanciest silver dress, so Peppermill seemed like the place to go.  Umm...maybe that was too much information...  This place is definitely a 70's disco hall converted into restaurant.  With neon pink lights and plenty of mirrors all around, you walk in wondering if you might be seeing some platforms and bell bottoms with the Bee Gees performing on a stage somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were none of those things to be found.  However, what they do have is pretty good food at very generous portions.  Unluckily for me, I was starting to become more and more hung over by the second by this point in the afternoon but I felt it would probably be a good idea to get something in my stomach.  Being 4:00 in the afternoon I decided that breakfast would probably be the best call so I ordered up what ended up being I gigantic plate of eggs, potatoes, sausage, and other vegetables.  I tried in vain to gobble this down but I was definitely feeling nauseous by this point.  Yet, despite my throbbing head and queasy stomach, I still thought that the breakfast was pretty damn good.    I'll definitely be coming back here my next trip to Vegas.  Hopefully I'll be less hung over next time.",

Go, grab a delicious bloody mary, sit by the fire fountains, or get a table. Order yourself one of their great 10-egg omelets (I ordered one that had crab and avocado in it).

Peppermill is definitely for the Adam Richman (Man Vs. Food host) in all of us. One would think with quantity, quality suffers but Peppermill definitely proves that adage wrong. Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits. Pancakes are HUGE, over 12\" in diameter (at least) with a fluffy sweetness to them that beg for just a tiny amount of syrup when you dress them with the AWESOME \"stripper\" sugar sprinkles.  I definitely love this place. The blue neon and comfortable seating and long raised walkways turned into foliage.........somehow makes me believe Peppermill used to be a strip club in a former life.......but who knows ;-).   Service is great here: quick, friendly, and very personable. It's reassuring to know that in a city built on transient party goers, at a place centered on the strip, people still remember your name.

I also love the colored sugar.  Call me crazy, but it's fun.    The food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.    If you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.  I'll bet you find something you like too.",

Breakfast and dinner menu served all day which is good seeing as its Begas and who knows what time you will be eating or getting up for that matter. It does stay packed and its usually a lil wait especially for larger parties which is tp be expected we waited about 30 mins and thats with 5 of us and people waiting outside to be seated when we arrived. So it wasn't a bad wait at all, and to top it off they have a lounge/bar area you can wait in and grab a drink and check out the cool decor...its most definitely a 70's feel restaurant with the lounge having a cute lil old school drop seating area with a fire in the middle with velvet everywhere! It sounds tacky but trust me you will love it! Its very cute and has great ambiance! And the breakfast food is sooo good! And bonis they have a full bar also with good drinks and most of them are nixe sizes. You wont regret it!",

If theres a long wait, I suggest moseying on over to the Lounge and have a drink while ya wait :) Peppermills definitely a spot to check out while you're in Vegas even just once.",

For the price and the amount it cannot be beat. Real diner food. Husband also had nachos and wings one night and raves about those as well.",

Cheesy decor, good late night eats, drinks  and friendly service, and for me memories of trips to Vegas as a child where this was our breakfast spot before heading back to CA.  Our party of six arrived at about 11 on a Saturday night and were quickly seated.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and while they weren't the most amazing version of Eggs Benedict I ever had they were tasty and with three eggs and hash browns included more then enough for one person.  I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take \"free\" pictures of our group with no obligation.  Of course to upgrade to a nice full size photo without the Peppermill logos all over turned into $10 but it was a nice memento of the evening and easily scanned and divided among six of us!",

    "text": "I had heard of this place from multiple people and then saw it on an episode of Drinking Made Easy. So when my wife and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out the Fireside Lounge.   It's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing.   The service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.  We wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!  We had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off.   One of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. It's just neat to watch it in action.",

There used to be a Peppermill in Cupertino when I was younger and we frequented the establishment. Clearly, Cupertino was not a good fit for this type of restaurant but Vegas is just perfect!  On Saturday, we stopped by for brunch. We got there around noon and had to wait more than half an hour to get seated.  I ordered the burger (because I don't eat eggs) but quite a few people in my party ordered breakfast items.  Everyone (except one person) loved the food.  The portion size is huge!    However, you have to be aware that a lot of shady things have occurred in those booths over the years so don't get too comfortable in there.  Also, the crowd is really mixed - from overweight chicks in tiny shorts to Asian gangsters to local families.",

Dark, with cool, deeply sectioned off booth/tables, HUGE, great,  girly cocktails with 2 foot straws, cool music, neon backdrops, friendly waitresses with big boobs and even bigger hair, huge, freshly prepared apps that taste phenomenal, especially at 2 am, the Peppermill has it all. It's the ultimate cool, nightlife vibe sans the crazy Strip Tourists and the annoying energy that they always bring. You know, the energy  that screams... \"I'm 21.. in town for the weekend from Cali , and I'm going to Pure!.\"  You get the drift.   This is a place that locals haunt.  And if you are an out of towner and just happen to be here, then that's probably because some kind hearted  local took pity on you and told you about it.  So enjoy.

So you wait and in the meanwhile you see about 5 more parties of three and four go in front of you. HORRIBLE!! And all they can say is \"its going to be a longer wait cause you have a big party\". Yeah no sh*t! But you've been waiting for the longest time while you are seeing others get seated. In my opinion not worth the wait. Avoid this place and go to Denny's which is right next to it.

You will pay about $11.95 for a breakfast dish, this is not an IHOP or Denny's style pricing. You will notice the inside decor looks like you are outside...i hope that made sense, since there was a tree right next to me at breakfast. I think I was more into the experience then the actual food, the taste was nothing special just average.  The Fireside Lounge I admit was a selling point. Very relaxing and had that Tony Montana (Scarface) vibe to it. I am singing \"I Ran\" by Flock of Seagulls right now. Great spot for a early morning grub session or late nightcap before bed.",

We were greeted quickly by the hostess and asked if we wanted a drink from the bar. I did, so she sent over a cocktail waitress in a cocktail dress.   We settled in and took in the decor. Because they were busy and I had a screwdriver in front of me, we didn't make any note of the time. My wife commented that the place looks like the back of Sammy Johns' 1973 Chevy van. Wonderfully kitschy.  Our waitress took our order and made great suggestions, because I had trouble deciding what I wanted. They were excellent suggestions. My wife had a pesto chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread. I ordered Munch's breakfast.  Both dishes were huge and easily could have been split between us. I dove into my plate, hash browns mixed with onions, mushrooms, peppers and linguica, topped with eggs. I enjoyed it so much that I never even asked for a bite of the sandwich. I know she enjoyed it because she kept nibbling on it even after the point of immobility. I fully understood, as I was at the same point picking out slices of linguica from my plate.   I have already recommended the Peppermill to friends.",

The shrimp scampi had the most unique flavor, I still can't put my finger on it, or put it in my mouth.  All 4 of our waitstaff and the 2 drink ladies for the alcoholic beverages, did their best to keep us glued to our seats for an extended stay.  The ambiance of the place was something right out of a Japanese teenagers dream of an American high school prom.  I really enjoyed the nachos, and the fact the toppings came out halfway through us eating them, well that was the special touch only found in truly unique eateries. To cap off the meal we finally got the garlic bread, which was for our salads, just in time for desert.",

Since it is open 24 hours, we got there around 10pm and was not surprised to find it very crowded (normally a good first indicator). There is plenty of parking surrounding the building which is unusual for the Strip. Once inside, we were hit by the sights and smells of a typical diner, but with a uniquely Vegas flair. It almost shouldn't work, but yet it does. They immediately pop over to take a touristy souvenir picture (it turned out really good, so of course we bought it). The drink menu has all the super fun drinks you can think of. As for the food, let's just say you aren't going there for the food, but it wasn't terrible. We got the strawberry shortcake for dessert, and upon its arrival, had everyone laughing around us as we all pondered how 2 people were going to eat this monstrosity!! Certainly a tad oversized, but again...Vegas. Service was friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Peppermill.!",

The prices seemed a little stiff until the food comes up. Let's just say the portions are huge! If you are trying to avoid taking food home, it might be a good idea to split an entree.  I ended up with the corned beef hash. As I mentioned above, the portion was huge. The corned beef hash wasn't really my thing and would probably try something different next time. The lemon-cranberry muffin that came with the entree was bomb though!  If you are really hungry and wanted something to eat, I would definitely recommend The Peppermill!  4 out of 5 stars for lots of value, nice staff, and decent food. Seems like the establishment can get busy, so please keep that in mind.",

    "text": "Peppermill is a fixture on Las Vegas Blvd.  Located just south of the old Rivera Hotel and Casino, it's within walking distance of the casino properties on the north end of the Strip.  I had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  I finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the Strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. It was the right time to give The Peppermill a try.  Honestly, everything was just okay.  Certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  I was a little surprised.  We went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.  The waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  They didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  Get in, eat, get out.  Average.  The food was average too.  This was disappointing since I had heard so much about The Peppermill before--almost all very positive.  I don't even remember what I had the first time, and I rarely forget what I order at a place the first time I'm there.  The second time I ordered the Southwestern Beef Kabobs.  They tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  I'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  Again, not bad, but not really great either.  I'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the Las Vegas Strip.  The atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  It's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on The Strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  The website make the place look very cool.  Better on the web than in person.  Once again, not bad but not great either.  Just average, and I'm not sure average can survive on The Strip these days.  Parking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.  I sincerely hope The Peppermill doesn't go the way of the old Sahara and the Riviera.  They could be something great.  (They SHOULD be something great.)  If you're on that part of Las Vegas Blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  But with all the choices within just a few miles, I'd honestly go elsewhere.  There are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  Even though The Peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, I can't give it more than two stars.",

We were able to grab drinks in the lounge while we waited. Super cool fireside lounge area. Food was very good and reasonably priced. It's not your typical over priced Vegas food location. Biscuits and gravy was on point. Service was good and timely. We will definitely go back on our next Vegas trip!",

    "text": "The peppermill was right beside my hotel and luckily the first place I happened upon when attempting to walk the strip. It looked busy and busy usually means good so we walked in.  definitely unusual decor... I don't really even know how to describe it ... sort of like mid century design... 80's-90's color palette ... steakhouse meets juke joint breakfast diner?  But I do have to say the atmosphere was great. As I said, it was busy. We were quoted a wait time of 25 mins and were seated in probably 10. the greeter sat us and Jen (our server) got our drinks. She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal.  The cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee!  I might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding.  So instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food!  My GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side... I did sneak a few of these and can say they were great ESPECIALLY with the house ranch sauce.  Good thing I walked about 5 miles of the strip after we ate! I must say though that even after walking a LOT I was full until dinner time.",

Fire coming out of water.  It feels kinda like being in a fish tank. A pink fish tank.   They serve all manner of sweet, strong, and overly garnished cocktails. Tall ones, short ones, pink ones, and blue ones. Some of the drinks are the size of fish bowls. Pink fish bowls.  The bartenders are in black and white and the cocktail waitresses are wearing evening wear. Drinking these crazy drinks in such an atmosphere can really have a good effect on the old disposition. If you know what I mean.  So I have visited the lounge a bunch and never so much as walked into the restaurant. So the last time I was in town it was time.    The ambiance was the same as the lounge only a bit brighter and more restaurant like. Which might have something to do with the fact that it is indeed a restaurant.  The evening gown clad waitress came over and brought us mai tais and what not. The restaurant waitress was dressed interesting also, I think. All were nice.  The food was quite good and served in over sized portions. Pancakes, omelets, burgers and stuff like that. I personally had buffalo chicken wrap due to some reviews I have read. I would not normally order some such thing like that. It was really good. Everything everybody got was good. Big salads and other bullshit I don't remember.   So two good things in one building. And it's on the strip, albeit the ass end of the strip. And for desert you can go across the street to the Riviera. Go get it.",

Because of the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try the Peppermill Restaurant located next to the casino.  The reviews were right. The place is very unique with lots of neon lights and spacious tables. The food was great and the portions too big to finish. Service was great and prices very reasonable. It was later at night but the place was still very busy but we did not have to wait. If you are looking for a fun dining experience in a diner type restaurant, I highly recommend this place.",

I've pretty much had most of the salads, soups and a handful of the sandwiches.  My favorite thing off the lunch/dinner menu is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  Oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of fresh fruit.  Yum...I just started drooling thinking about it.  The last time we went I got the steak and mushroom salad thinking it would be a mixed green salad with mushrooms and a couple slices of steak.  No sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  Granted it wasn't Meyer's Ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!  Let me not forgot about the most divine part of Peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  Of course I've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 AM but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  Prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  Their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version I've had in Vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  Don't forget about their Bloody Marys which are the size of a vase (Rock star tip:  Order an extra shot to ease the transition back to the daylight).  I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in Vegas, Peppermill is not the most innovative but I just have to give Peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good.",

Their pancakes were so dry that they absorbed all the syrup and saliva in my mouth making it impossible to chew. We also had an omelet and another dish. They were both average at best.

The decor is this strange mix of neon lights and faux exotic plant life (think blooming cherry trees and birds of paradise).  And the Fireside Lounge is too awesome for words.  We put our name in for a table, then went to the properly dark & swanky lounge to enjoy a couple Bloody Mary's.  It was the perfect place to zone out while sipping our tasty beverages as we continued to wake up from our very late night playing poker at Bill's Gamblin' Hall.  Once we got seated, I ordered the Feta & Vegetable Omelette.  It was scrumptious!!  It had spinach, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and provolone cheese on the inside, with crumble feta and tomatoes sprinkled on top.  The portion was easily large enough to serve two people and I could only eat half of it (that's a bummer, as I don't like wasting food).  PLUS, that half omelette with its usual breakfast sides were so filling that I just had a Nathan's hot dog later and was good for the rest of the night.  The service was also great, with our friendly and helpful server Jennifer.  Please do yourself a favor and have breakfast here at least once the next time you visit Las Vegas!",

The drinks were large and good! We enjoyed the time we spent there catching up on the comfy couches, watching the food come out to others sitting around the fire pool looking very YUMMY! Just had to go back after a show down that way and tonight got to eat!!! Wow it was YUMMY....The chilcken quesidilla was packed full with a garlic marinated chicken that was so tasty, the nachos were red and green for Christmas and just covered with cheese, all warm and gooey and  all the accompaniments on the side like salsa, beans and sour cream topped it. Then the pulled pork sliders....well need I say more??? Really enjoyed it all!",

We asked her to choose any place she wanted to go eat for brunch and this is what she wanted. No five star fine dining steak house as we normally do this year. She wanted something much more casual and breakfast lol. What better place than the Peppermill. I was a bit caught off guard because I haven't been to this place in YEARS! I forgot how good it was. When we arrived it wasn't even busy and we were able to be seated immediately! The hostess was very friendly and helped us find a big enough table for 6 including a chair to sit my baby niece in. I also forgot how cool the ambiance of the place was with the neon lights and old school diner style tables. The outfits of the employee's are so cute it's so funny to see them walking around especially the cocktail or beverage girls. Not quite sure what they are called officially but either way it's cute!   Like many have already raved about.. HUGE PORTIONS! I checked the pictures on Yelp prior to arrival and I had my taste buds fixed on one of these crazy big omelette's. It was more so in the evening dinner kind of time and I thought it was funny that my family all was in the mood for breakfast food. Except my nephew (teenager) just had to be different and get a sandwhich lol. Anyways let's get to this food! Yum! Since this was a family affair nobody ordered anything off the cocktail menu, and yes I know me of all people stayed sober and stuck with my water haha! Oh but believe me when I say I will return and take advantage of their daily happy hour! The drinks here look so fun and colorful.   Entree's  Mediterranean Omelette w/ bagel and cream cheese  Marco Polo Omelette w/ blueberry muffin  Veggie Omelette w/ Lemon Cranberry muffin  Country Fried Steak w/ mashed potatoes and veggies  Conquest Sandwhich  Conclusion from the entire family was we all enjoyed ourselves to the max!",

The menu was pretty extensive with breakfast served 24 hours a day.  Our server was excellent. She was attentive and checked up on us appropriately. The food arrived very quickly. My husband got the sampler and I got the Lorraine omelet. The sampler was as nothing spectacular. The omelet was fluffy and not that flavorful. I subbed the home fries for French fries, but they came out so undercooked.  To sum it up... great service,  love that it is open 24 hrs... but the food was not good and I definitely found a long piece of hair cooked into my omelette. So grossed out.

We shared 16 piece of hot wings and they were pretty yummy! They're huge though! So if you're not so hungry I recommend you just getting the 10.   We also had a Scorpion on the rocks.. YUMMMM!!!!! I walked out of the happy and buzzed at 12:30pm lmao! It's huge, so if you're driving I would recommend to share with someone!  Also, blended has ice cream(also delicious) !   OH AND THE PEANUTS ARE ADDICTING!!",

To be honest, I enjoyed the lounge area and drinks more than the restaurant it's self. My girls and I got the Sunrise Mimosa which was excellent. It was made with Moscato and champagne but it was still great. The place is packed so it's great customers can go to the lounge, get a drink during their wait.   The food was just regually 'diner' food to me. Nothing special about the Fresh toast, bacon or eggs I had. I said light cheese on my eggs, they put much cheese on my eggs, so I would only eat a little bit. The sausage links were huge and the bacon was alright. Again, nothing exciting about the meal, thus the three stars.  I would miss this place for a better buffet on the strip if I were you.",

Lots of old school Vegas charm (i.e. Neon and mirrors).  The portions are HUGE. I had a standard waffle and my husband and Mom split a burger. You'll likely wait a while not only to be seated but also for you food. Grab a mimosa, enjoy the scenery, and be a tourist!",

The fire pit is definitely special, though all the coves throughout the lounge make it an intimate spot or great for a group.  I went for the Blue Hawaiian with Grey Goose ($10.50), and it went down easy. No skimping on the alcohol.  I did find it a little weird that all the servers are wearing long, black, busty gowns, but they looked classier than at other places, for sure.  They played old, live music clips of 90's artists singing their biggest hits, like Jewel, Hootie, and Sheryl Crow. Again, a little odd, but pleasant.",

    "text": "This place was wonderful. My boyfriend and I had a very quick night in Vegas. The night before we went to the High Roller which everyone should do and had dinner from a taco truck. So around 3am (we are from the east coast so my sleep schedule was all screwed up) I woke up hungry. So around 330 I had woken him and convinced him we should go to breakfast since we had an early flight out that day.   We were staying at the SLS and asked an employee downstairs of some breakfast options. The hotel had a breakfast but the guy said Peppermill was great so we called an Uber. It was maybe less than a mile away so we ended up walking back.   Once we got there, we felt sort of old because apparently everyone is just awake at 4am in Vegas - like from the night before. And we are showing up sleepy since we just woke up. Anyway, the place was packed but somehow we got seated very quickly.   Our waitress was over right away and showed us the drink specials which I could take advantage of but bf couldn't since he had to work that day. So I decided to rub it in and ordered the scorpion which is huge. I think she said six shots are in it. I can't remember for sure because I had six shots of liquor. Whatever it was, it was tasty and gigantic.   Our food even came out quickly which we didn't expect given how crowded they were. I have no idea what I ordered - I can't find it on the menu but there is a pic and it involved eggs and peppers and chips. It was fantastic and I don't usually love breakfast at 4am. Bf had the chorizo and eggs and ate all of it.   We ended up walking back to the hotel which made us feel sort of better about ourselves given the amount of food we just ate. Anytime he's working here again I want to come back and try some of their regular menu. It's a great place. Food is good and service is wonderful even though they seem completely busy even at 4am.",

My coworker and I came here after working a trade show since it's super close and easy to get to from the convention center. I ordered the focaccia chicken sandwich along with curly fries. My only complaint was that the bread was a bit dry but the chicken was cooked perfectly and the curly fries were greet too. The ranch was sub par, but I'm somewhat of a ranch snob.   The service was a little bit slow but eh it's on the strip technically so what do you expect. Overall the food is good and the old school Vegas feel is somewhat endearing as well. I'll for sure have to come back sometime for breakfast. Viva Las Vegas!",

Her recommendations were the Eggs Benedict and the country fried steak. As enticing as those sounded, we both ordered the Fruit plate. THANK GOODNESS she recommended we share one! It was so yummy and it came with a mini loaf of banana nut bread. We are a lot and stuff took home 2 to-go boxes! Great price too!  Place is a fun spot and a time machine back to the 70's.

My party of five was seated right away.  *Bacon and Eggs: three farm fresh eggs (scrambled hard) served with four slices of bacon, hash browns and your choice of toast ($12.75) 2 *Eggs Benedict: 3 poached eggs (poached medium) on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns ($14.25) *Joe's San Francisco Special: traditional classic of scrambled eggs with spinach, pork sausage, ground beef and onion, seasoned and served on crispy hash browns and smothered in a golden cheese sauce, served with wheat toast ($13.95) *Maserati Omelet: a superb omelet bursting with sausage, jack and cheddar cheeses and mushrooms, smothered in a perfect italian meat sauce, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, served with hash browns and your choice of toast ($13.95) *Side of Bacon: 5 pieces ($5.50) *Coffee ($3.50) 4 *Pepsi ($3.50)  I got the Joe's special. I always order this when I go out to breakfast, so it was nice having a Vegas twist on it. I liked the addition of the cheese sauce. I don't always like potatoes, so I kinda wished they didn't put the whole scramble on top of the hash browns. I was able to eat around it though. I tried my friends maserati omelet. I adore meat sauce, so I enjoyed this twist on an omelet. Tasted like spaghetti bolognese in breakfast form. I also got a side of bacon cuz I adore bacon. A good size as it came with five pieces.  I didn't know this until a friend told us, but apparently this diner has been featured in quite a few films, etc. I thought it was a cool little bit of trivia. I didn't recognize it, but one of the more prominent films mentioned was Casino.  Good place to go if you're super hungry as their breakfast portions are huge. I could only finish a quarter of my plate. They have a nice varied menu, so there's something for everyone. I heard there's a fireside lounge area of Peppermill as well. I'd love to come back and check that out.",

    "text": "My husband and I are still talking about our Valentine's Day breakfast . . . not only was the service great, but the food was delicious!   Approximately 8:30am we went to have a celebratory breakfast. When you walk in, the lights are dimmed, lots of teal/pink/purple colors. Cool vibe.  And I have to add, the music selection was fantastic!!  I ordered the Eggs Benedict: 3 eggs over two English muffins, Canadian bacon, and smothered with a flavorful, rich, hollandaise sauce. Golden brown, crispy hash browns served on the side.   My husband ordered the New York Steak and eggs: 3 eggs (he ordered over-easy), perfectly charred Med-Rare steak grilled with hash browns on the side. He chose a toasted English muffin on the side.   To drink, I had a spicy dbl Bloody Mary, and my hubby had a dbl vodka soda. Good pours and yummy  The bill came to $65.81. Certainly not the cheapest breakfast in town, but the large portions, ambiance, and great service was without a doubt worth it!  Overall, it exceeded our expectations and we can't wait to try lunch and dinner next.",

The eclectic decor reminds you of the good old days of Vegas and if you have a good thing, you don't change it!  This place has two sides so make sure you go to the right side to get what you are looking for. The right side is the restaurant  and the left side is the (Fireside) lounge.  The Restaurant has just about anything you are looking for no matter what time of day. Don't see what you want on the menu, just ask because they may be able to make it for you.   The Fireside Lounge is where you go to relax and enjoy reasonably priced drinks on the strip. This is where you go when you don't want the crazy crowds of the big casinos. You can also order food to enjoy the night.",

    "text": "There is something intriguing about this place when you enter. It takes me back to a time when restaurants felt like this. A feeling I can't explain, a feeling just known.  After a few more visits, safe to say service has been pretty consistent and the food is certainly shareable. Unless..you're drunk and hungry and can kill it all by yourself. I, on the other hand, have been able to take leftovers home. Price is quite Denny prices, but similar to prices you'd find at hash house. Honestly, it pick this place over Denny's just because of its ambiance.   My first experience with Peppermill was in Reno and completely loved the lounge firepit lounge, though, I have yet to visit the lounge at this location despite it being in the same building.   I thought their food was good and something about those rainbow sugar crystals which I have no idea why they chose to have that on the table...but because it's the Peppermill...it makes sense. Like, why wouldn't they have rainbow colored sugar crystals?! Lol.  It's a great spot to dine and lounge along the strip without having to be IN the casinos. I've seen children in there so it's certainly kid friendly in the dining area. You could even get away with rolling a stroller in as well. Lots of booth seatings. When it's time to pay, you walk up to the register. I'm sure handing it to your waitress is a option as well, but don't grump if your waitress never returns after she hands you your tab.  Definitely worth a try! Certainly a place to take visitors to eat or chill.   Enjoy!",

The food was always consistent, the staff friendly and efficient and the place spotless. Even today it does not disappoint.   On this night the Peppermill, although not busy (weeknight early) hit again on all cylinders.  My tasty club sandwich, fries and a coke were awesomely simple and thoughtfully prepared, as signaled to one of the chefs via a two thumbs and nod from me to which he winked back.   I was transported to childhood memories with the neon and fake tree decor - and signature colored sugar container on the table - I've never seen that done anywhere else. My Nana actually \"borrowed\" (her words) one of those back in the day via her big fat purse. One of these days I'll buy one since I still feel a twinge of guilt for her actions and I can't find the one she \"borrowed\".  As the North strip continues to evolve I hope the Peppermill will continue its quest to just do what it has always done and do well. Awesome food, campy decor and Las Vegas personality. It knows who it is.",

Of course - I had to find the biggest fish bowl drink I could and it was heavenly. The bartender must of been a goddess that was molded from perfection and passed it through her creation. The Scorpion Bowl - it's a killer.   Well had I known that ordering chicken nachos would of put a fork in me - I tell you they were piled high as MT. Everest and it was a sad let down when I could reach the top. Only so many can, I guess!   The set up was great, however, we had a little shuffle in the mix as some of our parties food did get messed up but they were prompt to fix it and even offered a discount on our bills. Which we gladly accepted.   5 Stars! Give them a try.",

Big round banquettes for groups make it a nice place to stop & hang out without feeling the Vegas Rush to move on & not miss something fabulous.  Flashback decor includes mirrors on all the walls, red upholstery, faux forest-like greenery and a central fireplace/fountain (propane bubbling up thru the water making the flames dance on the surface).

    "text": "If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the Peppermill Inn Restaurant.  I had heard about the Peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that I make a stop there during my stay in Sin City. When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner. The lettering on the outside said a lot when I see \"PEPPERMILL\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, \"Do you get a headache working here?\" She giggled and said,\" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it.\"  As she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served. I called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there. Rumors of the breathtaking \"Fireside Lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there.  Do yourself a favor. Go to the Peppermill. If not for the decor, do it for the food. Yummy!",

    "text": "I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.   Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...     Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).      So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.   Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas. ~G",

This is authentic Las Vegas, where the waitresses wear Toni Tenille halter jumpsuits and there is a fire surrounded by water. I can't even put it into words how fabulous this lounge is. The coffeeshop is average, but get into the lounge!!!!!!!!!",

Unfortuntely before even gettIng my fruit platter I was served nasty banana bread that wasnt even cooked but apparently it was according to the new bread cook and server. I just feel like the fruit platter should have been free if I was served bad food. Now the fruit platter came out and everything seemed like it was hanging out in the desert. Also it's served on wilted lettuce. For the finale I couldnt even touch the raw onion rings or muster the courage to eat fried shrimp. Tomatoes on the sampler platter were black. Overall would never go back. Ps I want my money back !",

COFFEE MATE vanilla creamer!!! full bar available.. eggs benedict & potatoes around $10 french toast under $10 (yes i ordered both. but i gave my taters to my bf) i kinda sampled a bit here & there from everyone at our table, & everything was delish. definitely coming here next vegas trip. oh, this is at the north end of the strip.  theres a Ross next door in case you forgot to pack your strapless bra.. we walked from the hilton over here w/o complaining",

I love everything about Peppermill. The decor transports me to a magical tacky fairy forest. Perfect when you are drunk and looking for good eats. The waitresses are decked out in equally tacky but booty gazing outfits. Love it. They have plenty of personality too and you have to if you are wearing that fit. The food portions are huge so dont order multiple plates. If you are going with your significant other give the fireside lounge a try. Its really romantic sitting next to the fire with neon lights all around you sipping on a huge and delicious drink. They are open 24/7 so even if your late night turns into an early morning which tends to happen in Vegas stop in. Its not too far from all the major hotels and all the taxi drivers know whats up.",

This place is open 24 hours and always is filled with entertaining people (most likely drunk, or acting like they are just because they are in Vegas) watching. Don't let the decor scare you, at first it's a little overwhelming, but you will grow to love the cheesiness of it. The corned beef hash is pretty good here. It's not crispy like I would prefer, but it's the perfect combination of just corned beef and potatoes. I can't tell if service (food wise) is slow here or if it's just because I'm always starving when I come here. Either way, the servers are really accommodating.  *Usually a little tipsy when I come here so unsure about food being as good sober, but drunk me loves this place*  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anitaeat.com&s=14efe95c768295c052c5ff4eddff6e4d46bf1ac720e22cab1ca53e8f3aec1c76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anitaeat.com</a>",

We had gotten off the plane in the middle of the night and wanted good eats and drinks with convenient parking before heading to where we were staying. Peppermill seemed to be the type of place I was looking for.  I was delighted to see free parking and their own parking lot and equally as delighted at the ridiculous decor inside! The menu is huge. My boyfriend had an omelet and I had a panini and fries and we were both stuffed. Glancing around it looked as tho all of the portions were just as big. Once we were done eating we ventured into the lounge and had a seat at the bar and eventually seats cleared out at the cozy fire pit which is surrounded by red rounded couches and lots of mirrors. We enjoyed big tropical drinks and people watched.  The Peppermill is the type of place where anything seems to go...exhausted travelers such as ourselves were welcomed during the week but an evening gown and tux would work just as well. IF you want some late night eats after a night out drinking in a really cool environment I would call this a must do.",

The fireside  lounge is really cool, (kinda looks like a porn set shoot!), purple & pink neon lighting, round couch area to sit back and enjoy a cocktail. Over the top Vegas style, nice! The hi lite of the lounge is the water feature with flames emanating from the middle surrounded by a circular set of couches to kick back on. Our group  rolled in to get a Bloody Mary. Spicy yes, lots of good vodka, yes, big stalk of celery, Cucumber slice sidecar on the goblet, cherry tomato impaled on a plastic toothpick-very tasty indeed. We saw another group who ordered Scorpions, a massive 1/2 gallon goblet filled with Rum and stuff ; 24\" straw included. Food wise , at breakfast,  I ended up going big , NY Steak & Eggs, perfect Med Rare cooked seasoned slab of cow, perfect scrambled eggs contained in a ramekin, Killer hash browns, Coffee was eh, but who cares. Good service , a bit more $ than other places, but I'll gladly pay more for the good stuff. Peppermill, ambiance, good food, strong drink, what's not to like!! We'll be back!!",

KEYLIME PIE MARTINI: Taste just like pie, normal size.  FOOD:        PASTRAMI BURGER: Well done and very tasty I paired it with onion rings. Huge servings, so I took most of it home since I ordered and finished my drink before any of the food.          Chicken Parmesan: Okay let me just tell you, the noodles are neon orange but OMG!!! It's the best neon orange noodles I have ever tried in my life!!! It's got  little spicy kick to it and basically magic in your mouth, again the portions are huge so my husband took most of it back to our room.  Overall a great experience and will be back for sure my next time in Vegas, the prices are very standard but keep in mind the portions are huge!!!

There is a large variety of special drinks I've seen the bartenders make here that I've never seen anywhere else. Happy hour drink specials take place everyday from 3pm - 6pm, and 9pm - 11pm, and the bartending staff is very friendly and helpful! They're very knowledgeable about all of the items on their menu, and are not shy about offering their personal opinions of their favorite dishes etc.  The neon lights give the place sort of an old Vegas feel, which I like, and they have a knack for rewinding the time with their music videos from the 90's. I've also always enjoyed hanging out by the fire pit with the blue flame; it serves as a great place to hang out with friends after a night out of clubbing and drinks. Only downside--location. Not a huge fan of the area it is located in but what're you gonna do?  I'll be returning soon.",

There is a photographer that comes around to the tables and you get a postcard of the photo at the end of your meal (you also have the option of purchasing a larger,  cardboard framed version).  There's rainbow sugar on the table.   I have been to the Peppermill several times.  I started just going to the Fireside Lounge,  but on the last few trips,  I've eaten at the diner too.  The food is really good and very reasonably priced for the Las Vegas Strip.  Last time I was there, I had a spinach omelete,  which was giant and delicious.  The pancakes and hashbrowns were also tasty.   The Peppermill is a must see when you are in Vegas. The Fireside Lounge next door is beyond kitschy and has all kinds of tropical drinks,  even some non-alcoholic ones. They serve honey roasted peanuts and play ridiculous music videos.  If there's a wait for a table at the diner,  take a seat at the bar and wait while sipping a Zombie or virgin Pina Colada.",

I had a huge delicious breakfast on this last visit. The breakfast is always my fav here.  Be prepared that you will get a BIG plate no matter what you order. I ordered a salad once and ate off it for several days lol. The salads are seriously huge and good.  The \"conquest\" in a great sandwich. Curly fries pair well with it.  The servers are nice but chatty with each other and not always paying attention to the tables.  Kinda pricey but you get a lot of food. It attracts many tourists but at most times you will find more of us locals inside eating or having a drink with friends.",

I've come to Vegas with different people on most of my trips this year and have always brought them here and they enjoy it too. Love the casual, fun ambiance and culture of the restaurant. Can definitely say my favorite meal is the French Toast Collage and a nice big Mimosa from the bar.",

If I lived in Vegas I would be here probably too much for their larger than life plates, cheesy- tacky yet cool Paradise style Vegas decor and for the convenience of great service 24hrs a day.   After the Yelpeasy party I was quite starving so we made a pit stop to the Peppermill for some late night grub. I was craving breakfast and I had a huge selection to choose from. After much convincing from our server Nick (who was quite awesome btw) I went for the Maserati Omelet. Filled with mozzarella cheese and sauteed mushrooms and then topped with an Italian sausage marinara sauce. This is totally not the type of thing I would order but I am so glad I did as it was pretty stellar.   Our bfast portions were beyond huge. I think it was advertised as a 3 egg omelet but there had to be at least 5 eggs or they get their eggs from pretty large chickens if not.   Nick was our server and he was great! Service was great all around from the hostess, to the guy who took our drink order and to the cocktail server. Will totally return here next time in Vegas and needed some late night Vegasy eats.",

    "text": "This place is hilarious!    We found it on Yelp (course) and were seriously surprised. LONG day of flights plus a workout in. We didn't want to get super decked out. Went literally from the fitness center in our hotel to Peppermill after walking down to the strip. We told the cab to take us here and he was cracking up.  We didn't get the joke till we arrived.   Pretend and visualize you at a IHop/Denny's with ambiance lightening, dance music that serves alcohol. You have arrived at the Peppermill Lounge. LOL!!!!   The food ROCKS here. Late that Saturday night we each had a mediterranean omelette with egg whites and hash browns.  Bran muffin for him, blueberry for me.  We barely said a word to each other. We just chowed! I kept eye balling these HUGE onion rings that were passing our table and said I HAD to go back at some point and get my onion rings.  It was a must-do.   The next day for lunch we needed something sort of easy and quick. It was Sunday and we walked in around 1130 am to see a JAMMED room of people WAITING for tables to get in....I'm telling you, it's THAT good. We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.  Next time I'm just getting those onion rings. :)   We made fun of it yet went there TWICE.  We like our grub and it was worth going two times. Prices are more than fair and the staff is good.",

Peppermill is quintessentially Las Vegas :) It's open 24 hrs, and seemingly always packed.  Located on the north end of the strip, it's not the greatest location, but convenient enough and with ample parking. They make a mean sandwich, and supposedly have amazing banana bread! The service can be a little slow, but it was friendly none the less. What I love about this place, however, is all the neon lights and it's 50's diner quirk. There is also a bar attached that has a nice little indoor fire-pit that is soooo retro fun. It gets crowded so be ready for a wait or to sit at the counter.",

    "text": "LOVED the Peppermill.  A friend had told me long ago that I needed to go here and I've been meaning to, but finally made it on this last trip.    SO worth it!  First of all, I think it's probably CRAZY on weekends because we were there on a Wednesday morning and there was a crowd of people... luckily only a 15 minute wait, though.  Perfect timing for us to head into the Fireside Lounge for a Bloody Mary!  The Fireside is AWESOME.  It's so 70s Vegas... all shiny and neon.  There is a big fire and water element in the middle with couches around it in a circle.  Love it.  The Bloody Mary was huge, but not so strong.  I just totally loved the atmosphere and it was nice for us because it was also pretty empty, so we had the fire pit to ourselves.  When they called our names, we were sat in a big booth and ordered our breakfast.  The husband had a French Dip and ordered the fruit as his side and WOW, it was a huge bowl of nice fruit, including a whole cut up banana, strawberries and melons.    Very nice. I was jealous.  I wanted to try a bunch of things so ended up getting scrambled eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy.  It was WAY too much food, so I only ate about a third of it.  The \"three eggs side\" was more like about 5 eggs.  The biscuits and gravy were good, but not great and a huge plate.  I think they should do a smaller version.  I wasn't that fond of the hash browns either.  Only the very top was crunchy and the pieces are just too big for hash browns.  But, otherwise, I enjoyed the food.    Our server was attentive and the food came out quick.  Cost for food was about $30, but I over ordered.  We really enjoyed our meal and the whole experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to the Peppermill!",

Sadly for you but yummy deliciousness for me this was my second visit and second time devouring as much of the Country Fried Steak and Eggs as my belly would hold! The hand breaded steak topped with homemade sausage gravy truly makes you want to slap your mamma. Who would think a diner in Vegas could perfect the ultimate southern dish? This is served with 3 eggs, toast and hash browns for just $15.25 but be hungry, very hungry!!!!!!  The interior is so welcoming with bright neons yet trees, flowers and greenery throughout. The service both times has been excellent. Each time we had a 15 minute wait so be prepared and they did seat us in less which is a complement to a well run restaurant. Nothing is worse than a \"hangry\" guest being told 15 and it being 30!!!! That doesn't happen here... The menu is extensive and they are open 24 hours so take time from the casino and enjoy a great meal here.",

The timeless decor is sure to set the establishments foot print here on then strip for decades to come.

They did a great job of fitting as much seating as they could and yet its still comfortable because they are booths and not tables on top of each other. They had a TON of fake flowers all over the place. Even fake trees in the center. I really am not a fan of all that fake flower crap, the colors are usually off of real stuff. The fake stuff gets SO darned dusty, too, and that's just plain gross especially in a restaurant environment. The one fake ivy thing by me didn't feel dusty, but we were still thankful we weren't stuck under one of the trees. They have a cocktail waitress, which kind of reminds you of old style Vegas. The cocktail we were handed didn't list Amy beer at all, so I had to wait for her to come to our table to find out what they had. 1 draft option, Stella, so I ordered it. Alas, they were out. So I ordered a bottles beer. Wouldn't it be the cocktail waitresses job to know that there's no Stella tonight?  Anyway... The menu was what you'd expect in a diner, lots of choices and many fried.. And it was about the quality that you'd expect - we had cream cheese stuffed chicken with penne pasta and country fried steak with mashed potatoes. My hubby said the mashed potatoes were average and enjoyed the country fried steak. My cream cheese/herb stuffed chicken was fried and not too bad. LOADS of pasta, way more than one portion.  We also had dessert - a brownie Sunday for the hubs and strawberry shortcake for me. I asked for some fudge to be added to it and they accommodated (it's super yummy that way).",

Then we ordered and it seemed like the waitress didn't know anything we were talking about when we talked about the food. My girlfriend ordered the clam chowder as an starter and it was cold, completely bland and the potatoes inside were under cooked. I got the tomato caprese stack and the cheese seemed to have been sitting out for a while before it was brought to our table. Dinner food took an additional 30 minutes to come out even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Dinner food was okay but nothing compared to usual.

The dining experience will also take you back to old school style Vegas diner with the funky carpet and floral printed upholstery and indoor trees and string lights...  Yes. Definitely old school.  I did however; enjoy their food too.  Loved the French toast.. and my husband got some gigantic Scramble that just filled me up as soon as it was left on our table.  Great service.",

Anyways let's talk about their food. The Nachos were nasty it was dry, yet the chips managed to be soggy. Did they even try on the cheese? They literally got a bag of store brand cheese and just melted it on top of the Nachos. Mozzarella sticks were ok, the chicken wings were salty, the sausage, the bacon and egg with French toast were mediocre.",

Asked waitress for cocktail service 4 times -- noone ever came.  Food order took more than 45 minutes to  be processed.  I should add that the place wasn't filled to capacity.  People all around us came later than we did and got served before us.  Ordered an omelette for dinner.   Huge, but very average. And did I mention cold?   Going to the front to pay the bill at the end was even worse.  2 people in line in front of us and it took 15 mins to get them taken care of.  When the hostess finally got to us and asked casualy, \"how were things tonight?\" I said back to her, \"honestly, pretty bad....\"",

    "text": "The Peppermill is Great for Families.  There aren't many places on the Strip my wife and I like to bring the kids, but The Peppermill is one place my wife and I like to bring the family for lunch that serves up great diner fare and tremendously big portions of classic Vegas ambiance.  (A note here about the Fireside Lounge. It's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. Fire pits and scorpion bowls. Awesome. But keep in mind, adults only.)  The Peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. Vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. And like I mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.  The menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays.   As for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.  The Peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding Vegas kitsch.",

I visited in April 2009 during my first trip to Vegas. This was a nice place with a similar feel to the large neighborhood bar & grill chains, but more unique.   The menu was huge... like a bible. I think this would be a safe place for most folks... there should be something on the menu to please anyone. It just so happens I wasn't particularly pleased with my meal, but only because I took a risk on a entree I wasn't sure about. If I'm in town again, I'll definitely go back to try something else. The menu consist of 24-hr breakfast, burgers, steaks, chicken, etc.",

The decor is so kitchy and kooky it is just entertaining in itself. The walls and ceilings are covered with mirrors, there is a lot of pink neon happening and there are these big fake cherry trees. They also have a great lounge complete with an indoor fire pit. Their food is typical diner fair, but amped up a bit. Unless you are really hungry and can put away some serious food, splitting an entree is probably just fine. They have got great Reubens, burgers and breakfast. My husband had the California omlette that was so big, he ate half, then we both split the other half for breakfast the next morning. They also have your basic cocktail menu, that you order from your cocktail waitress. This has become a must when we go to Vegas!",

I hit 4 aces 5 hundred bucks!! I was stoked because as I said I didn't gamble really.. Coincidentally my date comes strolling in the door right after...so we went in the lounge area & had drinks & a little bite to eat...anyway now that I'm older & I'm a widower a friend of mine wanted me to go on a double date with him and his girlfriend's friend was going to be my date (kind of a blind date so to speak)..this was last weekend...they decided that they wanted to go here..i said ok what the hell I'm game..so we arrive went in & really didn't notice any changes...it looked pretty much the same..it brought back memories but again now that I'm older I'm like really? It was cool when we were younger but now not so much...food is ok drinks are strong..as i said in the beginning..this place isn't bad...if you're new to Vegas it's worth checking out..as for me though i probably won't be going back....",

    "text": "The minute you walk through the front door and see the slot machines and pink neon lights you just know that you are in for a classic Vegas experience. The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.  It is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.  You don't need to worry about the time of day because the Peppermill is open 24 hours and serves Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner anytime. This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist. The Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  A great Las Vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the Peppermill ****",

    "text": "Pro: Anna in the Fireside Lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention Anna?   Con: Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food.   Went to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazel's review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game.   So, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place.   The hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time.   We walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations.   The food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot.   Overall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good.",

    "text": "Bad experience. I was excited to eat at a Peppermill as I used to love the one in Concord, CA. Either things changed or this is not a good restaurant.  I walked in and was seated at the counter (per my request). Although the spot was not cleaned, I assumed it would be soon. The waitress came, after a longer than average wait upon arriving, took my drink order, and left to give me time to decide what I wanted. Five or so minutes later, she returned to take my order. I saw her again once my food was ready and she looked at the spot in front of me with a look like \"where should I put this (as no one came to clean the counter). So I said \"well I guess I'll sit over here since no one is going to clean this\" and sat in the empty space to my right. She looked at me with the 'deer in the headlights' look and said \"oh, uh, sorry\". She set my food down and I didn't see her again until she breezed by to drop off my check. She had time to chit-chat to another patron (an obvious regular) but not to see if I needed anything (like a drink refill). Just as I am ready to leave to pay, she then notices my empty glass and asks if I need a refill. The food was mediocre but no where near what it used to be, and the fries were barely luke warm. I paid, left her a low tip but still more than I should have, and left. The spot I originally sat at had never been cleared. My first and last visit here. I can get better service and food from Denny's........and I hate Denny's!",

From the huge breakfast portions, to the breakfast bloody marys, to the waitresses (I swear ours was a stripper at nite!).  The BEST part of this place, the fireside lounge!  Straight out of an '70s porn set/ night club scene!  I LOVE IT!!!  The food was pretty good, country fried steak & eggs, how can you go wrong?  And how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  The corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  The one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  Another goodie was the Bloody Mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10AM.  FUN!  All in all a fun experience!",

For drinks we started out with a few daiquiris to set the mood. We started with the walnut creek salad which is served with a pear cilantro dressing. Candied nuts, chicken, blue cheese, craisins...this one had everything! We also split the caprese ciabatta sandwich, but could only handle half the bun. I highly recommend the onion rings!! The food was good, the ambiance is old Vegas, and the prices are a bit high, but I'll be sure to come again when back in town. I'll also be sure to save room for a sundae because they looked fabulous!",

The Peppermill is like a time capsule from the 80's and has a certain kitschy charm that is irresistible to me.   They have a restaurant on one side and a lounge on the other side.  We chose to go to the 21+ lounge side to celebrate my hub's birthday. The circular pink plush velvet booths, fake chinese lantern flower vines, and blue neon tubing are so cheesy and awesome.  They have tv's at each booth playing music videos from the 70's.  The waitresses wear floor-length black gowns. They have happy hour every day from 3-6 and from 9-11.   Went on Saturday 1-9-16 at 6pm for dinner.  $49.67 got us two of their zombie cocktails, a long island ice tea, a glass of moscato, and a chicken tender dinner.  Their drinks are strong and their food portions are very generous.   I've been here 4 times now and each time the service is spotty...the servers are not overly friendly and they might abandon you for long periods of time.  It took us two hours to eat on Saturday because of the long stretches between seeing our waitress.   When people come visit us we always take them here...there is no place more \"Vegas\" than the Peppermill! I don't have much more to add that the 1800+ other people haven't already said but if you've never been here you have to check it out.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are waiting for our food right now, and I couldn't wait to write this review.   I was SO excited to visit Peppermill. It's everything I love: over the top uniforms, kitschy decor, bad music and diner food. We walked in and I was in love. We put our names in, and it was about an hour wait. That's fine, we knew it was popular. We went to the bar and had several Bloody Marys each while we waited. Thankfully our bartender was great and the Marys were alsp excellent, which was the ONLY saving grace in this entire experience. After nearly an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, I went to the podium and asked how long it would be for our party. My exact words were \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be that person or obnoxious, but could I check on the wait for my table?\" The girls asked my name snd initially couldn't find it, but then I pointed it out at almost the top of the page; it was very easy to see because almost all the other names (a good 20) below mine were scratched out, but mine wasn't. The girls asked me what time I put my name in, I told them right after 1:15. The two hostesses looked at me horrified amd said \"it's almost 3:00!\" I told them yes, I knew, and I was very upset. Then the two girls started arguing \"well, you were putting names in,\" \"but you were the one calling!\" and then turning to me and cooing about the time and telling me it sucked how long we waited. I don't CARE. Fix. The. Problem.   We were promptly seated at that point, but I asked to speak to a manager. At first, she was very empathetic, but then seemed to lie to my face about what the problem was. I told her what had happened and that I'd wished the girls up front had handled the situation differently (I told her I'd wished they'd just have apologized), and she said she's going to talk to them. Fine. Upon returning, she told me she was the one calling names, remembered calling us, and that she didn't know what happened because the system was messing up. Um, no? For one, the girls told me they were calling the names. Two, my name wasn't scratched off. If you'd even called it, you'd scratch it out if we hadn't come and you cancelled our party. Three, what system? It's handwritten names in a book and a speaker, and we could hear it fine in the bar. Bartender didn't hear our name called, either. So sorry, not buying that bull. She offered us apps but I was over it, I wanted to eat breakfast and leave.   They expedited our order, and the food was fine. I wasn't expecting spectacular, since I came for the atmosphere. My boyfriend loved his omelette, though. Everyone was nice and all, and the manager comped us and apologized, even going as far as to walk out of the restaurant and wish us a good day. That (along with FINALLY eating) really helped, but still have a bit of a sore spot. We'll see what happens next time in Vegas.",

Good food bang for your buck but nothing special, mediocre food with large portions. This is good for on a budget people . It's off the strip a bit, very far down and has a parking lot.",

The poker machines at the entrance are just the start - it's the chain smoking patrons, neon lighting and artificial trees that really give it its charm.  Food here comes in large portions and is big enough to feed two people. Omelettes run a little, but the hash browns are just crispy enough and cooked to perfection. And as a bonus, there's an attached bar!",

Extensive cocktail menu. Breakfast served all day & night. HUGE desserts perfect for sharing. Great diner food with something for everyone.  In a nutshell this is a Vegas classic and just a fun spot.

    "text": "I grew up at the Peppermill, and I've never had a bad experience. There portions of food are the size of two faces, but that's not why I go there. It reminds me of Vegas 1970's. It's a classic! The neon lighting to booth style seats in the Fireside area you feel as if you're stepping into a world once been. You would swear you saw Elvis Presley walking through, and not an impersonator. I've gone to the Peppermill all hours of the day, in all states of intoxication and never once have I been treated poorly. I've always been treated like a rockstar! The girls on the restaurant side can be a little overwhelmed at times because it's usually slam packed no matter what time of the day you go. I never expect my food to be delivered quickly because it is always slam packed! This doesn't bother me because it allows me the opportunity to go to the Fireside and enjoy a drink. Their prices for drinks versus the portions are absolutely Fair. However, the portions of food you receive are enough to feed a small village in New Guinea. The prices for the portions of food and the flavor of food seem almost cruel because they are so cheap. If you've never been to the Peppermill, then you've never been to Vegas classic! Every single kid in my generation has ditched school once and gone to the Peppermill or party all night and gone to the Peppermill for a 6 a.m. breakfast. Can I think of one bad experience I've ever had at the Peppermill including the food? No, not at all.  If people have bad experiences, I believe their expectations are too high and they don't enjoy the Ambiance for what it's worth.  If you really want to treat yourself, order the French toast. I would suggest splitting it with somebody if you have a small stomach because it's one of those things where your eyes are bigger than your stomach.  REASONS TO VISIT THE PEPPERMILL: 1. 70's Old Vegas neon style decor 2. Fireside lounge with lots of cozy seating 3. Huge food portions 4. Reasonable prices 5. Amazing food",

    "text": "Late to the game again.  I've lived in Vegas since 1992 and just recently made my first visit to this spot that's a favorite with visitors and locals.  It looks like some kinda Miami Vice-inspired disco with all the purple and pink neon inside, but it also has waitresses who wear blue and white old-school uniforms and call you \"honey.\"  The menu has something for everyone, which is a good thing since it's open 24/7 and you never know what you'll be craving in the wee hours.   The first visit, I had an omelet which, upon ordering, I had no idea would be made with 10 whole eggs!  No wonder I couldn't even finish half.  The second visit the other day, I ordered the turkey club with fries and that was also a healthy portion, but I was able to finish most of it in one sitting.  There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.    Depending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.  We ate lunch here two days ago on Friday, November 11th, at 12:30pm, and waited about 30 minutes.  Mind you, it was a holiday, so considering that, the line wasn't horrible.  If you have room left, get an ice cream sundae.  We got the hot fudge and demolished it.",

None of us had been there before, so we made the mistake of ordering an entree each. Their servings are really big! I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!    My mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!    My grandma ordered the Pancake combo. It came with three large pancakes, three eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links. It was a very large entree. I should also mention that I really enjoyed the coffee here.   All in all, it was a great and very filling meal. The service was really good as well. I'm sure we'll go back.",

The lounge is nice to sit and take in the views of the all the neon lights and watch old rock videos that they play on the tvs.  When we went to get a second round we could not find a waitress.  When we got our table, service went quick.  I got Joes San Francisco special which is enough for 2 people and very good.  Husband got French toast ambrosia which was good and also a large portion.

Right next to the Wynn. They have their own spacious parking lot. We never wait more than 5 min to get a seat.

After any buffet, Egg Works, and Hash House were all shot down for having too large of portion sizes, I finally sold them on the Peppermill, largely by promising them neon.  Pros:   - Damn tasty diner food and freely flowing cups of coffee. This is all I really ask for in a solid Brunch Experience -Super friendly staff and prompt service, and no problems with slightly different orders and keeping coffee coming. - The look on my friends' faces when they realized this place didn't have small portions either! Oh noes, mah dietz. I laughed and laughed and laughed/  Cons: - Long wait, really with no where to sit and wait. We hung out on a curb and were frequently asked if we needed a cab. - Prices were a bit on the high side relative to the awesomeness of the food. Got the impression I was paying for the neon. Wasn't too bad, but also nothing to compose a sonnet over.  Overall Verdict: - Yummy classic diner food in a classically vegas atmosphere. Will return when hungover, or with out of town and unadventurous guests. Won't be on the favorites anytime list, but certainly not shabby.",

Nothing to write home about which is a bummer because Being a vegas landmark I wanted so bad to have a great expierience but nope.",

We were placed in a plush booth in the middle of the restaurant so we watched as they walked other people's food around. It all looked good but I went with the French Toast and was not disappointed! Our server was training a new girl and they both were very polite and quick. We would definitely come back on our next Vegas trip.",

If you are in the mood for some kitsch, some plastic decor, and some down home greasy diner food - you are going to have a ball. If you are hoping for upscale ambience and a dish to help you stick to your Whole 30 or vegan lifestyle, then you need to keep driving. It's not a place that I crave or one that I think of for a casual mid week dinner, but worth taking out of town guests to visit or popping in once a year or so.",

    "text": "The Peppermill is a Vegas institution. Once you walk into the place you see it's 1982 all over again. Once you get past the updated/dated decor (they keep it just like that) you'll find the service to be very good, the portion sizes are huge. But more importantly the food excellent. It's always fun to watch some one order an appy and a main course and barely dent the appy.  My wife will order an appy or bowl of soup and steal from my plate.  The prices a reasonable. Portions are huge.   Insider tip: go on off peak hours. Traditional meal times make for a long line for a table.   You'll be skipping your next meal no matter when you go.   Just go there.   The only downside to this place is it's so popular. So during busy dates in Vegas, the lines to get in can be more than an hour.   The lounge is is old school vegas. A limited menu for the lounge but you can head into the lounge while you wait for your table.  I have been going here for 8 years and I'm working my way thru the menu.",

The atmosphere was amazing. They told us it was opened in 1972 and it doesn't seem like much has changed since then. The decor is great and I just loved the experience.   Our server, Krystin was AMAZING!! She was such a sweetheart and she paid attention and was super helpful with everything.   Now to the main event, the food. The food was perfect and the portions are HUGE. You can feed 2 to 3 people with the size of the portions. I had the Mediterranean omelette and the rest of my party had the ham steak and eggs. That country ham steak was about half a pig. This was a really great spot to try something new.",

    "text": "I can't remember the last time I felt compelled to actually write a review on anything, but my recent experience here still has me irritated. If I could give zero or negative stars, I would.  A coworker was in from out of state, and a few of us brought said coworker to the Peppermill lounge Wednesday night. A couple of us love the funky, retro decor there, and we expected our peer would appreciate it too. We were hungry, and our server had been MIA for a while. So we decided to venture into the restaurant to eat. Despite having been to Peppermill numerous times, this would be my first dining experience there, and wow, was it ever a mistake.  We were seated, and a cocktail waitress immediately stopped by the table and tried to push cocktails on everyone at the table. One person made it clear that they wanted a beer, and oddly, she still tried to push that person to get a cocktail (they have beer there). She then became more aggressive toward the people who didn't order booze. Two are Mormon and do not drink. I thought we were going to have to tell her to go away, but she finally did so on her own. She returned a few minutes later to report that they were out of one of the beers that was ordered. A different one was requested which she didn't bring until what seemed like nearly ten minutes later. We never saw her again after that.   When our server finally showed up several minutes later, most of us ordered breakfast items for dinner. The food took an average amount of time to arrive. When it arrived at the table, the portions were fairly large, and everything looked delicious. My omelette and hash browns turned out to be quite average, with the hash browns tasting like they'd come out of a bag and were previously frozen.  One person at our table who ordered a sandwich took a bite and said the bread was stale, and didn't eat much more after that. I got about halfway through my meal, and as I was eating my wheat toast (they did not have whole grain, as I'd requested), I noticed mold on a slice. I promptly stopped eating. We were talking and enjoying each others' company and weren't really interested in complaining to management about the food. We probably wouldn't have had the chance to anyway, as we only saw our server three times during our time there. The last time we saw him, he brought us a bill which had all five of us totaled together. He told us we could pay with him or at the front. As we didn't want to wait around to see how long it would take him to return for our payment, we walked up front to settle up.   We needed our check split five ways, and ideally, itemized for expense report purposes. I asked the cashier if he would split the check for us. He didn't speak English well, and said he couldn't do it. I asked again, thinking perhaps he didn't understand.  With a rude tone, he said \"I can't split checks\". Meanwhile, I was looking at a modern point of sale that, surely, was capable of doing so. There was some other employee - a big, bouncer-looking type - lazily propped up on the other side of the point of sale. At this point, he and the cashier looked at each other as if we were stupid. They obviously thought we were tourists and that they'd never see us again. They were right about the second half of that. I unhappily threw enough cash on the counter to cover the total, plus a tip for our barely-there server, and I walked to the restroom.  When we walked out to the parking lot, someone in our party commented that when I'd walked away, the cashier muttered something about there being signs everywhere (which allegedly indicated a policy of not splitting checks). If there were any, I never saw them. Had he said that to me, it probably would have been my breaking point, and things would have escalated. If it is their policy, it's a ridiculous one. It's 2018, and it's not hard to do. Sometimes people need checks split. And sometimes, people in your restaurant are actually locals - locals who are going to spread word-of-mouth news about how awful their experience at your establishment was.  Edit: I almost forgot to mention the fact that 2 of the 5 in our group mentioned stomach illness the following morning.",

The portions are enormous! 10eggs in an omelette! Pancakes larger than the plate! Luckily we saw this before ordering.  We split a dish w scrambled eggs, bacon, and French toast w a decaf coffee. The sugar for the coffee is rainbow colored sugar!! Cute novelty. :) Coffee was perfect, not bitter or too dark. Scrambled eggs were light, fluffy, and not overdone. French toast (2 slices of Texas toast cut 1/2) was probably some of the best we've had in Vegas. Light vanilla and cinnamon dusted w powdered sugar and served w warmed syrup.   We so enjoyed our time, lingered a little longer than we normally would have bc we were so relaxed. Granted it was 3am and while full of customers, not too loud.   Added to my #fab5vegas list!!

    "text": "Every since I moved to Vegas I have been wanting to try The Peppermill Restaurant. Last night I finally got the chance to experience this place. Some of My friend couldn't make it to my wife's birthday dinner celebration so we decided to get together to make it up.  I liked that The parking lot is huge, plenty of parking for sure. Once we walked in, it felt like I stepped right into the 1970's. There is a foyer where a hostess is there to seat you. If there is a wait you can always go to the fireside lounge that's located inside Peppermill to the left of the restaurant side. (It's open 24 hours ) unfortunately The place had a stuffy smell it almost smelled like throw up,  that was a very off putting smell to experience before your about to eat. Plus the restroom were very dirty and close to the foyer.  Our booth  was directly behind the hostess podium on the other side of the glass so we kept getting random whiffs.   Hiromi was our waitress she was very friendly. And understanding when We took our time  choosing our orders we started with mozzarella sticks. My wife ordered the California Burger, I ordered the BLT&A with curly fries, my friends ordered the Peppermill Burger, Peppermill Pastrami Burger And the Fresh Fruit Salad.   Service was 100% amazing. the food was so good and generously portioned. My BLT&A was so big & packed with bacon and avocado. I got the mayo on the side but didn't use any, because the sandwich was great just the way it is.   My three star review is based on the rank smell and dirty restrooms . plus we thought it was weird that we had to wait in line to pay for our meals . it took us even longer because we had to split the check. And to top it off we had drinks added to our check we never ordered. It wasn't an issue but the fact the our waitress had to be called over to verify took us even longer to pay for our meals.",

I couldn't wait to try it. Big mistake.   We went in the early afternoon during a week day. It was busy and I took that as a good sign. We patiently waited as people in the waiting area were seated. But, as the time passed, we were not getting seated. Party after party of 2,3,4,5,6 people, who came in after us, were seated. We spoke to the hostess who said it would be a couple more minutes. Again, people just coming into the restaurant are being seated almost immediately.   We eventually did get seated and I was hoping the food would turn this into a positive experience. Nope. Yes, the portions are big. However, having a lot of food is pointless when the food does not taste good.  I got a BBQ Burger- it was dry and the BBQ sauce had a weird taste to it. Someone in my party ordered breakfast, so I tasted the hash browns. They were half cooked and flavorless.  The service was ok. The waitresses looked miserable.  It didn't seem like they had enough people working. The downside of having an open kitchen is that when you're sitting nearby, you can hear all of the staff complaints and arguments.  Definitely would not return or recommend.",

    "text": "My uncle and aunt suggested this place for brunch before heading back home on a long 3hr drive. It was packed with people when we got there. There was 8 of us and were quoted 40-45 min. Which went by fast considering the family was all talking and catching up. The inside reminds me of a strange 70's-80's diner with trees inside. I liked it. Very retro. Food was big portions and our server was very good although I can't remember her name. She took care of all our needs. Food was pretty good. It wasn't the best I've ever had but wasn't the worst. I'd definitely go back to eat there again. My plate had bacon , eggs, sausage and three pancakes . Wish they had something smaller with maybe one pancake. It was way too much food. Had lots of leftovers.",

We were able to be seated right away.  Unfortunately we were on our way home so we didn't have an cocktails, just breakfast/brunch.  The menu was big and has pretty much anything you could want.  I had the french dip and my husband had french toast.  Both were good and the service was fast.  There are a ton of nice, fancy places to eat in Vegas and if that is what you are looking for this is not the place.  This is more of a cool, old Vegas/Hollywood style Dennys.",

The seating is way too crowded in the place.  It's just visually overwhelming and the booth seating is unforgiving when it comes to trying to slide in and out due to the tables being permanently attached to the floor.  It was a chore trying to maneuver around overstuffed seating to get to and from the bathroom and get into the booths.  If you're claustrophobic, have physical limitations and with a large party of people, try to get an end seat.  Can you tell I'm not a fan of the large booths?!  The menu is extensive.  The food was good.  The air conditioning the night we were there was marginal.  Between the noise level, marginal A/C, and the cramped seating it was difficult for me to focus on the food.  The service was friendly and good; I don't recall having any issues with wait times.  It was good, but unless I get to have an end seat in an uncramped area of the restaurant, I'm not eager to return.",

Customer service: I've been here a few times but the last time the waitress was so sweet to the 6 girls I was with and made sure to get all of our orders as specific as possible. She came to check on us just enough so she didn't annoy us which is nice. She also brought out our check in a timely manner and served our extra food in boxes.   Ambiance: There is usually an hour wait but I make sure to go early. If I don't make it I go order a drink and hang out in the fireside lounge which I love due to its colorful neon decor. This place is always packed that's how you know it's food.   Food: I love that they have so many options and of course if you want to swap something out they will accommodate you. They are constantly filling up your water and drink which is nice. I usually get breakfast and do an omelet or French Toast Collage. The dishes have large portions! You can even share.",

Loved the complimentary photos being taken and given out (you could purchase a larger photo for $20 or two for $25). The only complaint I have is that as we entered and left the restaurant, managers or supervisors were reprimanding employees at the front counters. Not a good look for such a great restaurant.",

We informed the manager that it was complete garbage, and left. Luckily he didn't ask is to pay for it, because there's no way we would have. We have never done that before. Normally, we are gracious, and tip over 20%, even if things aren't that great, so I assure you, we're not just picky people.   First red flag, waitress didn't even ask if we wanted anything to drink with our food. When I got my iced tea, it looked like cloudy mud. Tea should ALWAYS be clear.   The soup was terrible.  She brought out a rock hard piece of bread. We asked for garlic bread, she brings out what looked like half of old sandwich loaf with a very gross looking spread on it. Didn't eat that.   When our food arrived,  my salmon was completely unseasoned, BURNT piece of tasteless leather. He asked for a medium steak. It cam out rare. The \"baked\" potato she brought out had the wrong toppings on it. They brought one out with the right toppings,  and even that was horrible. It tasted like they had boiled the potatoes into watery mush instead of baked them. The same went for his potato,  except he had cheese that had turned into dried rubber. Not one thing they brought to us was edible.   I can't even fathom how they have good reviews.",

    "text": "The Peppermill Fireside Lounge is an iconic old school Vegas restaurant that oozes with charm! From the moment I walked in and saw the quirky royal blue, diner style booths and neon blue & pink lights, I felt like I'd walked into Vegas' historic past! The atmosphere was electric!   As you'd expect in Vegas, the portions are huge. We split a Denver Omelette that came with Fresh Fruit & Sourdough Toast. We also ordered a side of Hash Browns--our waitress tipped us off that ordering hash browns with our omelette along with a side of fresh fruit would actually cost $3 more than if we ordered the omelette with fresh fruit and a side of hash browns!  Thanks for the tip! Everything was perfectly prepared from the fluffy, stuffed omelette, to the incredibly flavorful, crunchy hash browns (the star of my breakfast!), to the hot sourdough toast, to the fresh cut fruit. Our server even brought us an extra plate to make it easier to share! I'm a big eater, but we still couldn't eat it all, and the meal was a bargain compared to other breakfast restaurants on the strip.   Make sure you leave yourself some time to enjoy a cocktail in the super HOT, Fireside Lounge, decorated with red booths, blue & pink neon lights, and a fire pit. This spot is a MUST VISIT while in Vegas! Despite being on the north side of the strip, it's a nice getaway from the casino-based breakfast restaurants, giving you a break from the hustle and bustle for a bit, while soaking in some old Vegas charm!",

    "text": "While in Vegas, I was told that going to the Peppermill was a must. I went just before my flight and loved the atmosphere. It was interesting... neon lights almost like a strip club and then there are fake cherry blossom trees throughout the restaurant. The waitresses wear 70's waitress costumes and the booths are very fitting. A very interesting place and the food was diner food.. the food itself didn't have a lasting impression on me, although the environment did. The staff was very friendly, considering that i am sure that they get a lot of drunk tourists as we are taking about Vegas.",

There are 2 sections of the restaurant--the bar area and then the restaurant. The bar area has fire pits which is really cool. Now, to the food...after a night of drinking, nothing hits the spot better than the food here in Peppermill. I had the southern fried steak with hash browns and eggs. Pancakes were off the chain. My husband had the corn beef hash with egg which he devoured. The service is amazing!  All three nights, we had amazing waitresses that always checked on us. We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Though we have been going to The Peppermill Restaurant for more than 30 years, this is the first time I have checked in and reviewed on Yelp.  The Peppermill has been a 'must go' and honestly excellent choice for dining any time of day for us.  The restaurant has beautiful Tiffany lamps over each table that were made for the Peppermill specifically.  I wanted to buy one, but sadly, they are originals and made for the restaurant only. I LOVE the lamps!  They add to the ambience, along with the other lighting that reminds me of the beautiful past of Las Vegas.   The menu is amazing, offering a multitude of choices for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner and all day dining.  We usually show up right after the lunch rush, when it is a little less busy.  It's a little less busy, but less likely to have to wait for a table.  The meals we chose this time were different than the usual eggs Benedict and Lorraine Omelet, or Cobb salad.  We went off the normal grid and went for sandwiches.  The menu has SO MANY things to offer, it takes a few minutes [or more] to decide.  I chose the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich on sourdough bread, sans onions and with cottage cheese instead of fries and it was delicious!  The sandwiches are HUGE and more than enough to share.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, and exactly as I ordered.    Hubby chose the Peppermill Club sandwich, which is served with huge crispy onion rings.  Again, delicious and enough to share. It was absolutely EXCELLENT!  We were lucky enough to be in Vegas longer so on our second visit, our friend went along and ordered the pancakes. They are, like everything at the Peppermill, huge and enough to share.  Served with multiple choices of toppings, a side of eggs and choice of meat, it's a meal that will take you through the day, and again, enough to share.  I branched out on that second visit and went for the French Dip sandwich on sourdough bread, which is served with Au Jus and I chose the sweet potato fries to go with the meal. It was absolutely amazing!  Again, enough to share and more than I could possibly eat in one seating.  Hubby ordered the Peppermill Bloody Mary and said it was also wonderful.  The service is impeccable.  From the minute people are seated, they are greeted with a refreshing glass of water and offered drinks while guests have the time to peruse the menu, which genuinely does take some time to decide; so many choices!  All cooked to order and FRESH!  Honestly, we have literally been there at least 100 times since The Peppermill opened.  Collage French Toast is delicious, and my kids favorite. There are so many different things we've enjoyed over the years, and have always had a great time.  The Fireside Bar is set away from the main dining area and features an awesome fire pit lounge seating area for enjoying quite conversations, and a main bar seating area.  It's calming and beautiful.  Going to Vegas?  The Peppermill is something to make sure is on your 'must go,' list.  Hands down, one of the very best places to dine.",

When you come here they'll offer to take a picture of you while you're seated. Its free to take the picture but its costs to actually take the picture home which is not surprising!

The food was good and although they seemed really busy, they were available when needed. I love that the coffee cups are real size and not the tiny single cups you get at other places. They also provide french vanilla creamer which is a big deal for me.  I ordered an omlette which was the best I've had in a while. It has a sundried tomato sauce on it which was delicious. One of the best things about this place is the piping hot blueberry muffin that you can order rather than toast.   The ambiance is neat and kind of retro. I would eat here again while in Vegas. It's a great place if youre not looking for a buffet.",

Very attentive and very friendly.  Drinks were well made and loved the environment.  The only complaint I had, was that we were sitting too close to the bar, so you did get the smoke coming by you, if you don't like smoke like we don't, I would just recommend sitting farther away from the bar.",

    "text": "\"Fireside Lounge\"  I absolutely love this place and no visit to Vegas is complete without it. Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from \"Alice\" into \"Fantasy Island\" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, \"Would you like olives with that?\" He was a bit taken aback, but said, \"No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?\" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, \"I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini.\" Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more.   Sour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive.",

After my second Bloody Mary, the hour flew by quickly! ;) Once seated, I ordered the steak and 3 eggs, which came with hashbrowns and your choice of toast or muffins ($19 before tax). The portions were HUGE! I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the steak was! I ordered the eggs over medium and it was cooked to my exact preference. As for the hashbrowns, it was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. It really is a great diner and I could see why it was so packed! This place is great for any meal of the day since they are open 24 hours.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Riviera, so this place is basically the closest restaurant not in the Riviera food court. I had heard many things about the Peppermill - it was old, it was basically Denny's, you had to wait forever, etc. I still wanted to try it out, and I'm glad I did!  It is old. It's more of a relic of 80's Vegas. The Fireside Lounge is really cool, but very smoky. Not that great of ventilation.   The food was hit or miss, but the portions are so big you really don't care that much. Or you are probably drunk like most people in Vegas. Just make sure you get something you REALLY like because you are going to have a lot of it. Like, maybe the biggest portion of your life. Peppermill makes Chipotle look like a joke.   I say come by if you are on that side of the strip. It's a fun place and your only meal of the day if you play it right! The only con is there is always a wait.",

Today, I decided I wanted to order some food and go pick it up. I called and the women on the phone (who I assume is a manager, Peggie maybe?) said they won't take the order by phone, I have to come in, order and wait. This is ridiculous. I've never heard of a fast casual restaurant, not willing to take a pickup order by phone. When I told her that it sounds like they don't want my business, she said \"sorry.\"   It's not worth loosing guests over doing something that's standard in the industry.",

    "text": "Love, love, love this place! The food is always excellent and the portions are enormous. I want to say their omelets have like 6 eggs in them (or more). Seriously, come hungry or be prepared to take home leftovers.   When a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas. Burgers are delish and cooked to order (beware asking for rare...they take it seriously and will produce something pretty much raw on the inside). The service is great. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that.   Downsides: The place gets crowded. Really crowded. Weeknights seem to be the best time to go if you want to sit down and eat quickly. Also, the parking situation can be difficult. They have an itty bitty parking lot in front (maybe more in the back, not sure!) right on LV Blvd, so getting out can be tricky.   Bottom line: if you haven't been, go for the decor. Stay for the food!",

This was just enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip to not feel like a tourist trap (even though I'm sure it is).

This place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.    There's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.  This place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.  There's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!!   You can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w/my meal.  Honestly, I'm never really the biggest fan of diners.. so if it weren't for my bf's tradition of ending vegas trips here, I probably wouldn't have come back a second time.... but w/its unique environment, nostalgia, heaping portions of food, so so prices, i can see how it would be considered a good diner.",

I think if you are a tourist it is totally worth it for the cool ambiance the lighting is sparkly  and fun, the restaurant is dimly lit anding to all the glittering lights and trees surrounding you.  Big oval booths add to the fun 70's 80's ish feel.    I had a huge burger Ciabatta Pesto Burger Flame-broiled burger could taste the flame in the food.  Mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so I had to pick them off, tomato, Prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  All burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (I had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)  I do think however I would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good I hear!  That is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2 because the ambiance and bar is I think the highlight of any locals trip!  I wish my food would have all been fresh and I wouldn't of had to pick so much off I would have liked to have added a star to my review.",

    "text": "Cool place to grab breakfast or lunch. There are a lot of tourist who come here daily, so it is always crowded! The wait for a table isn't too bad. They have big portions, there is a big menu, so if you don't know what to choose you can always order a few different things and share with your group. I prefer breakfast at this place more than lunch. I have had their roast beef dip with onion rings, and it was just ok. But the breakfast is AWESOME. We had the french toast with tons of fresh berries and boysenberry syrup! Also the waffle with eggs, and bacon. I would definitely be back!",

I was first introduced to The Peppermill back in 2003 by my cousin's friend who swore it was the only place to go in Vegas for breakfast.  5 years later and I have to go at least once a trip every time I'm up there.  Honestly, the food is just typical diner fare.  I can't say there's a stand out in the food category besides the fact that the portions are GINORMOUS!  The thing I make sure to order every time is their signature Bloody Mary.  It goes down soooooooo easily after a good night in Vegas.  Go for the cheesefactor, if not for anything else.  I swear, you'll be stoked that you did.",

After being seated at my table, I'm asked if I would like something from the bar. Hummm. It's 5pm somewhere, but in Vegas ist 9am... Oh wait, clocks don't work very well here in the desert... Bring me an Irish coffee!!  The omelette was very, very big... too big for me to finish.  Full of flavor including the home made breakfast potatoes.  The service was quite prompts, even when a friend stopped in to join me at the last minute.   My tummy was very content after leaving and hitting the shops later.  This is on the strip, but not in the popular area.  For us, it was a good choice being fairly close to the Stratosphere.  Price wise, its not a steal of a deal, but it was good and very filling... worthy of another visit when Im in town.",

    "text": "I ordered the CFS and my husband got the Southwest Chicken Salad. Our waitress ended her shift and didn't put our order in so we waited a long time for our meal. I loved the CFS but everything was cooked in an oil that I didn't really like the after taste of. But smothered in gravy and didn't notice it on the CFS. My husband salad was very much lacking. It had very nice tortilla pieces in the center but they were so stale they weren't very edible. There really wasn't enough beans or avocado to really make this a southwestern. The chicken was cooked very well, very juicy. But overall not worth the price. Luckily we got 25% off for the wait.   We went to the Fireside Lounge and this visit was totally redeemed. It was early on Tuesday and plenty of seating available. We got a nice little corner in front of the fire pit. Gorgeous! We ordered the Scorpion and it was Delicious! Well worth $18. It's a great romantic environment. I will be returning whenever we have family in town.",

    "text": "I can't say enough good things about The Peppermill. A work colleague and I discovered this place while researching new places to eat during a convention. We ended up eating here at least one meal every day of the trip. Excellent service, extremely generous portions and exceptional food. It's no wonder this place has been around so long. The atmosphere itself is a mix between a 70s lounge and an 80s arcade. Very cool. Plus they serve liquor, which is a huge plus. I found the Bloody Mary, while quite generous in size, a little lacking in flavor for my tastes. The Coronaritas however were completely awesome. Enjoyed a few of them in the Fireside Lounge while awaiting our table on several occasions. Portions were huge and we couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was compared to the hotel restaurants further down the strip. We'll definitely be putting this place into the rotation on our next trip.",

Anyways, last February is the first time I went to the Peppermill with my then fiance--but now turned hubby.  :)  He said this place is linked to a chain in NorCal and Tahoe?  Anyways...it was pure bliss.  Much better than most food at the hotels.    I had the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was amazing!  My husband had the patty melt and it was delish!  The portions are huge...great leftovers when you wake up all cruda the next morning!  Plus they are open 24 hours...so you can go in all drunk, lol!  Anyways, this place is awesome and funky.  they have red white and blue sugar granules that you can even buy!  The lounge is awesome and they have these cocktail servers that roam the restaurant in these funky black dressses and the servers in the restaurant wear funky polyester uniforms...pretty funny.  I loved the fireside lounge too!  So funny!  good crowd!  I love places like these! :)",

Enormous portions (\"huge\" doesn't do them justice, they're so big), decent prices and a cool 80s-ish lighting scheme plays up the Vegas experience while hungover.  Fireside lounge is pretty awesome; I'd suggest having a drink or two with a small group around the fire.  The ambiance is amazing.  It's different than what you'll find in the rest of sin city.  Everything from the food to the coffee to the rainbow sugar sprinkles are fantastic.  Check it out before you leave town for home; your friends will be impressed that you know of such a \"local\" spot and you won't be disappointed.  Been coming here for years and plan to continue!  Perfect way to wrap up a weekend in Vegas.  Also, be sure to order breakfast.  Always the best.",

On my recent trip to Vegas, we stopped by the restaurant and the atmosphere brought back memories. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. We got a table the moment we walked in, but i think that was because it was a weekday. Waitress forgot about refilling drinks but apologized for the delay.   The food portions are very large. We were able to try the other plates that our table ordered.  My sister enjoyed the multi colored sugar and she wanted to steal it.  They sell it at the counter so i bought her one when we went back the next day.   They also have a really cool lounge that i might try to have a drink at when i visit again.  I will most likely go back when i visit Vegas again.",

The Peppermill is where everyone goes for bloody mary's in the \"morning\" (after check out) on the way home from Vegas. We had a big group of people and they were able to seat us together without much of a long wait. This place was packed, but not ridiculous so it was humming. There is a seperate wait person for every thing: coffee guy, booze lady,  food lady and so on which can make for a confusing time since its no ones job to get the coffee, except that one guy but he's in the back making crack for the rest of the wait staff (they are ALL so hyper).   Any who- the decor was alright, kinda cheesy blue neon lights and stuff. The food was decent, the coffee was hot and strong and I even tried the bloody mary (i hate them normally) and it was pretty dang fabulous.  All and all I wouldn't be completely opposed to coming here again.",

    "text": "Of all the times I have been to Vegas I was missing something.....I needed something out of old time Vegas, something flashy, gawdy, and cool not dirty  and cheesy like Fremont street and over the top like the strip. Then I found my oasis....Peppermill! I went here because I saw it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and I was in complete awe of the decor and the large drinks they had and what I thought to expect Peppermill gave more.  It's a great place to have drinks with your friends away from all the typical Vegas stuff. The waitresses outfits are tasteful and classy  from what I have seen at Vegas which is a relief itself.  First time goer and likes to drink get the Scorpion.",

More of a lunch meal. I HIGHLY recommend hitting the lounge late night after dinner for drinks/apps. The lounge is dark, good music, lots of TV's, sexy u shape couch's with plants/flowers separating the section all around you, a water feature with a fire pit in the middle. Pretty cool must see lounge.",

    "text": "If you haven't been here, I recommend trying it at least once.  It's open 24 hours.  Everything on the menu is always available (late night menus not required).  The decor is a fusion between tropical theme and strip club.  The inside has a lot of tropical ambiance, but it is kept quite dark, with neon lights throughout.  The female waitresses are dressed in short shorts, but fully clothed on top.  It is not risque at all, so don't worry about bringing the kids (you shouldn't bring your kids to Vegas in the first place...please leave them at home, you are ruining my vacation!!!), but it's a nice sight for guys.   I've mostly been here for breakfast, so I'm not sure about the lunches and dinners, but all of the breakfast items that I've tried have been very good.  My particular favorite is Munch's Breakfast.  The Fireside Lounge is a bar that is adjacent.  I believe it is a full bar.  Usually a cocktail waitress walks around the restaurant to take bar orders.  Peppermill is on the pricey side, but portions are very, very large to help make up for it.  2 people can definitely share one meal and both get full.  This is a place I like and go to it every time I'm in LV.  It may not be for everyone, but I think everybody should try it once.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot...their coffee sucks!",

My husband pulled it up on his phone, and saw the excellent reviews, so we went in. It was busy, and there was a wait, so we went into the fireside lounge. What a cool, hip, old-school Vegas setting! The Bloody Mary was the best I have ever tasted (I normally don't like them, but this one was awesome). The reviews that my husband  saw suggested ordering one, so we did (and two more). The food was amazing with enormous portions, so beware. For Vegas, the prices are reasonable, and we had excellent service in both the bar and restaurant. We will make it a point to go back to this place on our future trips to Vegas. The only negative is that it is down next to the Riviera, and walking in that area is a little shady. I wouldn't walk down there late at night; take a cab.",

The decor is fun and electric (literally ELECTRIC)! It's great late night comfort food, especially when you've been drinking and partying all night...er.. when you DON'T have the kids, of course! Okay so my review is for May 2010 when we visited here. It was our first night in Las Vegas and a first time bringing a child and...me being 7 months pregnant (so no partying for me this time! I was craving steak and was VERY skeptical about ordering it at a place like this. I ordered the New York ! New York ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with sauteed mushrooms.*** Let me tell you that for someone that actually does NOT consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints LOL!), THIS WAS EXCELLANT EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there! On another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95 ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night. We love the Peppermill! ***Don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. They REALLY appreciate that. :) FIRESIDE LOUNGE: When my man and I go to Las Vegas as adults, we LOVE the Fireside Lounge in all it's glowing ambiance! The drinks are fun, the hostesses are beautiful and elegant and they are always nice about taking our picture by the molten fire pit, hehe. The only thing I am sad about are the TV's they put in. They are  really distracting. If anyone knows the owners there, PLEASE tell them to take them out!",

We got one of the specials with spanish sausage, onions, peppers cooked with hashbrowns and fresh eggs and cheese. Yummy! The bar has this absolutely cool fire place/water pool thing you have to check out. Oh, and of course you can get a bloody mary or strawberry daquiri if your inclined.

I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings.

    "text": "It was our first time here. My party of 8 checked in, hostess told me the wait was 45min so we decided to hang out in the fireside lounge. The inside looks like a limo/ party bus... appropriate for Vegas. Cocktail waitresses were friendly; drinks didn't taste like there was any alcohol tho.  One star for unique atmosphere.   After an hour, I approached the hostess about how much longer & she said \"We're just waiting for tables to get up\" & no apology, which pissed me off. If I've waited way past the amount of time you told me I needed to wait, at least take 2 seconds out of the time your getting paid to stand there to apologize for your hosting skills.   Literally 1hr & 30 min later , 2x my quote time, we finally get sat! Then, we had to wait some more because it took 3 different people to get our meal started: 1 for basic drinks, 2nd for alcoholic drinks, 3rd for food. We kept hearing \"someone else will get that for you\", WTF. Then we happened to notice that another large party that sat after us got their food faster than us. We're angrier than hangry at this point!   The food: .. we ate it. Similar to Denny's. Second star for George (our server) for doing your job.   Paying out: Two people of my party had to leave early so they tried to pay their tab at the cashier stand. The manager gave them a hard time because we all had to be there to pay out but the rest of us were still eating. Annoyed af, I got up there & split the check myself. I expressed to her how terrible of a time we were having and she had no comment. Didn't even take two seconds to say sorry or ask about what happened. She probably trained the girl at the host stand.   Poor customer service for brunch.",

    "text": "What do you get when take a diner, a romantic lounge and circa 70s/80s Vegas and mix it all together in a blender? The Peppermill of course!  This is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.  As an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time.   Another thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny.   The Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain.   The Final Verdict  Pros: Vegas classic. Retro vibe and feel. Beautiful lounge. Huge portions.   Cons: Not the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that. Not the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that. Can feel a little bit campy, but it works.  Return Factor: 10/10. I'm always down.",

But if you're in a hurry go somewhere else.   Sadly, after this last visit I won't be running back. It's always packed and that's expected, but the service was way too slowwwwwwwww. I really hope they make these improvements because they have delicious pancakes and killer Bloody-Mary's.   Food was overpriced but each plate could feed 4 people so you won't be cheated when you see your platter appear. But if you have a hearty appetite or have a car full of linebackers or truckers they will appreciate the portion size.    Sadly my order wasn't great. My omelet with spinach was the consistency of sponge cake-yucky.  Our waitress forgot to get us water.  So trying to wave her down and find her was wearing me down.  I don't like to spend hours and hours in a restaurant with most of time just sitting around waiting for a waitress. I want to eat and get on with my day.  Sorry, but  I've had my Fill of the Peppermill:(",

Oh, well you'll see..\" Two words: deliciously tacky.   At first our waitress was prompt in taking our order before the rest of our group arrived. It later took her forever to get everyone's order in. I split the Marco Polo omelet with my friend.   They describe it as a huge portion, but honestly I could've finished the whole thing by myself. Wasn't really impressed. I felt like it was lacking in flavor if you didn't have a bit of the tomato hollandaise sauce to eat your bite with. The hash browns were good though. I'd much rather have gotten an omelet from the Omelet house.",

Since I was watching the game I stayed at the bar, but the lounge looks great and I will check it out next time I'm in town. There are comfortable booths and a great circular fire pit. The waitresses were also very friendly.   The margaritas were good. Can't speak to the food because I only had chips and salsa, but the restaurant and waiting area were packed when I was leaving.

The main draw of the room is a water feature off to the side with a gas fire coming out of it.    The lights change colors and all the TV's are playing music videos (when is the last time you've seen a music video?).  While it sounds like it's almost a tacky environment, it really is cool and not dirty at all.    Experience wise, the waitresses have a tiny chair they come in sit down on to take your order.  They call you \"doll\" and a bunch of other retro names and then smoothly walk away their flowing black dress not far behind.  Our friend billed the lounge portion as the \"place you go to seal the deal\" and I could tell there were many couples here.  Maybe not as cool as the Mandarin Bar, but the drinks are way more reasonable.",

    "text": "We visit Vegas several times a year so we like to find new (to us) & interesting places to try.  In perusing Tripadvisor while sitting in the Firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon Peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  Oh my, what a trip.  We drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.  Tacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in Vegas stays...\" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)  When our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries.   Peppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  It's on our list for a return visit.",

Perhaps the drink was so well crafted I couldn't taste it, but I'm almost positive there was no vodka in my drink.  The ambiance was fun, and the service was friendly.  I'm open to coming back later and trying the 'Mill again.",

My husband and I usually split a salad they are so big, but not this time.  I love this place, it is like an 80's throwback, lot's of glitz and glamour, and all the PerrpeMills I have ever been to are exactly the same. ((Bay Area included)).   The fireside lounge is pretty cozy as well (same as it ever was) a bit of an icon, nothing like a froo froo drink and some appetizers in front of a fire (in Vegas the fire place is not really a requirement) but it makes you think it might be really cold outside (which in Vegas is rare).  If you are visiting Vegas, this is a restaurant you should visit, I mean it is on the strip, and the food is good, lot's on the menu, the people watching is fantastic (I love to people watch). Interesting folks here and the pricing is reasonable ((I did mention it is on the strip right?))",

    "text": "I waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. I'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.  Let's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of \"old Vegas\". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.  The Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled \"Fireside Lounge\". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.  To your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.  On corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.  The best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.  Combine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.  And I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.  So on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints.   The portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.  The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed.",

They have two parts, pepermill restaurant and fireside grill. When you first walk then you see pepper mill and then there is Fireside further back where you can sit at the bar or near a beautiful fire pit that sits in water in the middle of a huge round table.   We had someone come take our picture and give us a little keep sake. The food was good and portions were large.  If you go to pepermill you have to order the blueberry muffin instead or toast... it's warm and served with cinamon butter... trust me it's amazing!   We liked pepermill so much that we went there twice during our weekend stay.... it's worth all the 5 stars!",

    "text": "During the fateful New Year's trip to Vegas, the Peppermill saved our lives time and time again simply by being the closest food source in the proximity of Circus Circus.  Inexpensive and inoffensive. That's how I viewed the restaurant and food. It was early bird specials all over the place. The food might have glimpsed a spice rack in the distance while it was traveling to our table, but it didn't stop to say hello or mingle with anything flavorful. But really, when you're drunk and hungry, tastes get in the way of the  barnyard biological imperative to stuff yourself and soak up the booze.  The waitresses were incredibly friendly, but seemed over-worked as they would accidentally abandon tables to time and history periodically. We recruited the woman hawking souvenir photos to find us someone capable of refilling our coffee and averted disaster that way.  Go if you have time to kill and like bland diner food. Old white folks should love this joint.",

Vegas being a cigar friendly city has always been a huge draw for us, and the retro Vegas vibe of the Fireside lounge has been one of our regular haunts. We were very disappointed to learn that cigar smoking, as of recent, is no longer allowed in the Fireside Lounge (only low grade tobacco that you inhale through your lungs in the form of a cigarette is allowed). A friend in our party was informed of this after he had already lit up a fine cigar! Given this change in the smoking policy, I'm not sure we (or those we know) will be making a return to visit. It's sad to see the classic and iconic Peppermill change in this sad way.",

Sit in the lounge while you wait to enjoy some music and TV/sports. There is t anything there that we have ordered that we didn't like.

    "text": "I've been coming here since I was old enough to start visiting Vegas so this place has a lot of memories for me. (Sitting around the table with a bunch of friends at 4am digging into a MOUNTAIN of nachos.)       Now I only get to visit once a year, since I no longer live just a few hours from Vegas. Some visits have been better than others for sure, but I don't think I've ever walked out unhappy. This time I had the Mediterranean omelet ($14), which was good and the creme brulee ($7), which was OK.  The Good: Not only was the omelet huge but more importantly it was good. There was plenty of pretty good quality shrimp and a fair dose of crab. The Hollandaise sauce was flavorful and complimented it well without taking away from the flavor of the shrimp and crab.  The Bad: The only complaint, and it's not a severe one, is the waitress didn't do a very good job of keeping up with our drinks. It was just bad enough to be annoying, not bad enough to be frustrating.  The Indifferent: The hash browns that came with the omelet were fairly unremarkable but I have to warn you, while I will eat them, I'm not a huge fan of hash browns so you might want to take my opinion on this with a little caution.       While I don't really expect much from creme brulee, I have had a couple that I really savored. This one wasn't in that category, while it was good enough it wasn't any better or worse than the average.",

In the diner there are huge artificial cherry blossom trees all over the place. The decor is like nothing I ever saw before. The food is excellent, too. At least what we had was good. We had breakfast. My husband got the pancakes and they were three enormous cakes that even he couldn't finish. (He ate the three pound Big Daddy Luke burger - but that's another review!) I had the french toast collage and it was yummy, too. The Collage is bacon, eggs, and french toast.   We took a cab here. I don't think it is the best neighborhood to go wandering around.

    "text": "I went here and gambled for the first time ever.  Here is a lesson about gambling.  You start off betting 25 cents on video poker and you stick a dollar in the slot so you can play 4 times.  You always get dealt 15 or 16 which is super boring, what do you do?  Hit and probbaly bust or not hit and probably definitely lose?  Anyway at some point you'll realize that if you bet 50 cents you can win more if you actually win and get up to $3.50.  Then you get cocky and bet a dollar twice and your money is gone.  Anyway I liked the Fireside Lunge.  There is a fountain in there with a real fire coming out of the middle of the water, you can sit around it and watch the TV screens which are plentiful and playing football, basketball (hoops) and some music videos, good ones like 80s and Roy Orbison.  That puts you in a good mood.  The lights are really bright blue and red.  Neon, with reflective surfaces and free nuts.  I had an \"Amstel Light\" for $5.50 which was depressing, lost $2 gambling and left.  But no one bothered me and you could just waste a lot of time in there I think.  The bartender was REALLY NICE and there are all these fancy dressed up waitresses with their ass and titties hangin' out all over the place.  A good first stop.  Across the street you can get a souvenir  or go McDonalds or do \"indoor skydiving\" and for all of these reasons, overall I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant, specifically the fireside lounge.  Make sure you are not wearing your gang colors or a ripped shirt though!!!",

The 70s dinner theme was cute. There was a cocktail waitress taking drink orders at 10am, but the drinks took a really long time. Pretty good drinks, though. The highlight was the sugar shaker, which was full of sprinkles. Not your average sprinkles, either. They went really well with our pancakes. The food was good but not out-of-this-world. A good breakfast spot if you are staying north of the strip, but I wouldn't make it a destination.   3.5 stars.  Visited June 2013",

Remember when you would hit up Denny's and wreak havoc on their menus, staff and bathrooms? Well, when you're in Vegas, fuck Denny's. Peppermill is here.  I don't know what kind of theme this place is going for. Everything about it screams cum stained strip club from the velvet seats to the neon ceiling lighting. I mean everytime I come here I seriously am anticipating fog to come out of one of the planters and up comes up Trixie the Tranny to start dancing. It's just reaaallly weird to be in this place but it's so exciting! Like I said, the place itself looks like a strip club, but the menus and the theme are completely different. I guess it's just bad marketing ideas for whatever they're trying to pull off.  Aside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN. The hash browns are perfection. I highly doubt you'll ever finish your food, but if you do, you should enter yourself in an Eating Competition. And when you do finish your food, make sure there's a bathroom nearby that you can destroy. On top of all this, the staff is really nice! Kick ass staff and kick ass food in a kick ass strip club! Kick ass!",

SECRET....order the scorpion blended with ice cream. it will freakin rock your world. o and be careful please cuz you won't be tasting any alcohol in it.....it'll taste like a fruit milkshake. :)",

What i love about this place obviously is the 24 hours of service, very \"Vegas\" ambiance (neon everywhere with mirror walls) and very good food and service. Service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner.   I would recommend hands down the BBQ pork ribs dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. Get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! Other notable favorites include the Chicken Fried Steak, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Lasagna.  The lounge inside the restaurant is also pretty fun especially if you are like me and do not really prefer the loud expensive ass clubs on the strip.",

    "text": "Two cliches apply to the Peppermill: everything you've heard is True, and words can't describe it.  There's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.  The lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!  The restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.  The prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a Strip experience like this. Go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir.",

Our props were impressive--a set of hillbilly teeth fabricated by my friend's orthodontic stepdad, bolas, dreds and curly blond wigs. These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.  I go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge.   Unfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars.   Still, Fireside is a must-see Vegas attraction.",

Pretty standard cafe food. The portions are enormous so I often suggest sharing as an option.   On this particular occasion I came just to sit with some friends and have a few drinks after work in the Fireside Lounge. This was actually my first time in that area of the restaurant. On previous trips I've usually had my fair share of drinks by the time I happened upon the restaurant. The lounge is actually really cool. It wasn't too busy and there were lots of cushy sofas to sit on around cool looking firepits.   I ordered a diet soda (because I'm trying to be good on weekdays), but sampled some of my friend's Pineapple Upside Down martini, which was delicious! I look forward to another trip to this lounge for food and drinks.",

    "text": "An unassuming (and frankly unpromising) edifice by Rodeway Inn and Riviera, which Aria/Vdara bellman described as \"shady and sketchy,\" with excellent, fresh and  affordable food in portions which make abundantly clear why 5 out of 10 of the leading causes of death in America are obesity-related. See HBO Weight of a Nation for a compelling and devastating account of this epidemic.   That said, the food is tremendous. I sat at the counter alone, waiting for a new friend to pick me up on the day of the marathon (which never came to pass due to the 2-10PM closure of the Strip). I recommend sitting at the counter whether you are alone or with one other person.   The grilled chicken salad with a half avocado is enough to feed a family of four. They have salads, sandwiches (the club sandwich was beautiful), omelets made with 12 eggs (Maserati is popular) and onion rings which looked life-changing.   Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared.   Service is great but be prepared for 30 or more minute wait for lunch or breakfast.   For those watching bill, this is a great choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner . It's open 24 hours and serves three meals all day.   They have silly tropical cocktails which I didn't try.   I was a bit adventurous and tried a salad with pear-cilantro vinaigrette which I didn't like. It was far too sweet. The chicken and blue cheese very good but I was in agonizing pain from being out with my luggage and unable to reach Vdara.   It reminds me a bit of Esau's in Santa Barbara at roughly the same price point.  Men (or lesbians) will enjoy the outfits: it's kind of a Jamie Lee Curtis Trading Places Heidi get-up.   P.S. I didn't go to the fire pit but everyone seems to enjoy that.",

    "text": "The Peppermill lives up to the diner hype here on Yelp.  Big portions of diner-style food are the main attraction, and a skilled group of servers deliver well prepared food with a smile.  Omelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.  Sandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.    For me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.  Prices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.  If you're at the Convention Center take the walk or pay the cab fare.  Considering the food there you'll thank me later, fellow Yelper.",

    "text": "First I want to say the food during my visit was phenomenal! Great taste and huge portions for a reasonable enough price. I had the chicken fried steak which was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sausage gravy made it that much better. The mashed potatoes were real potatoes. The veggies were lacking a bit, but still good.   My only complaint and the reason I give my experience a 4 instead of a 5 was the service. The cocktail waitress were very friendly and courteous, but our waitress seemed to be having the worst day of her life.   Upon being seated a server brought us our drinks but he wasn't the server. We waited on our server another 10 minutes before I decided to say something. I ask a random server for help and eventually they track down our server, Elisha. I don't want to pile on her as the worst, because she brought out our food fairly quickly. What I didn't like was her attitude. From her \"I guess you're ready to order\" when I asked to for a server to her slamming my change on the table after I paid for our meal.   In sum, great food but the service is shaped by the server.",

There are so many great options i could not decide. I was at the bar and kept seeing plate after plate go by and changing my mind. Eventually i came to the conclusion that i needed to get then corned beef and hash since it was that, that brought me in. I'm visiting from AZ so I turned to yelp to find me something new. This was close by and another yelper took a pic of the corned beef and that's why I came in. Was not disappointed. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Neon Lights, Good Drinks, and a Old Atmosphere. I love it!   Peppermill is located on the strip north of the Wynn. You really can't miss it with the big neon blue and pink sign. I feel like it's just a classic place. I mean my mom used to work there back in her day, its been in movies, and it still packed on the weekend. Peppermill is a unique place. It has been a while since I walked into a bar and was just in awe. I know it's an older place and it could use some updating but fuck it, this place is cool.  You have two parts, the lounge and the restaurant. My friend made reservation for the lounge for his and my best friends birthday for 20 people or so. We walked in on Saturday around 8pm and got to our table and started to order drinks. I love their drink menu. The have some basic drinks and then some ice cream items and even the scorpion. This night I was the DD so I could only taste a little bit of everything. Everyone got something a little different. Alabama slammer, grasshopper, creamsicle, and mudslide to name a few. Everyone had a blast and their happy hour is awesome. They have 50% off well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers. Also their beer are in a bottle. We found that out when we ordered Irish car bombs. No biggie tho.  Inside the lounge they have a fire pit surrounded by water. Every time I walked by the seats were all taken and there was a lot of canoodling. The decor reminded us of poison ivy's lair with all the leaves and plants and also a strip club. They also have TVs playing different concerts. It was interesting because music was playing but we could hear each other. We had a large area and a lot of people but we could all hear each other. We didn't have to yell across the table or yell in someones ear. Peppermill was a blast from the past and I want to go back.",

However once inside you'll see its True appeal. It literally looked like a strip club but was missing the most essential aspect of it, a pole! That could've, would've been nice!   The front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated. It took a while for our waitress to make her way to us which is understandable given that they were swamped but we had been waiting for 50+ minutes and could've used a refreshment right off the bat.  Our orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.    Overall, definitely not a bad option if you're in Vegas and want something yummy and fun for breakfast. However, if there's a long wait I wouldn't bother. I personally, didn't think it was worth the 50+ minutes we waited to just get seated. I did think the lounge was a fun place and wouldn't mind stopping by there for a pregame drink.",

One of my good friends from California was in town house hunting, so we decided to meet up for dinner and drinks. She was staying closer to the Downtown area so she found this spot on Yelp. I have heard such great things, and seen this on TV and all over social media. I am so glad we went because the Neon lights were such a cool addition to the decor. It has an old school look to it outside but once you go inside it almost feels like a night club or an ultra lounge. My kids really enjoyed the food and the attention to detail the servers provided. My friend and I are 2 peas in a pod and ordered the French Dip with Swiss. Did not disappoint. Especially with the warm au jus. Amazing.  The fishbowl was a great touch to dinner. We decided to split a fish bowl and my friend ordered the Tequila Sunrise and her man ordered a Hawaiian Sunset which was just such a cool look to the table. All the colorful drinks along with such great food. We wanted dessert but we were too focused on enjoying the drinks to glance the dessert menu. This is probably going to be a usual every time we get together.",

    "text": "Ladies please be very careful if you go to the peppermill..  The bartender PHIL that works in the lounge supports human trafficking. He is friends with pimps and he goes around trying to recruit girls. He has put my life in danger and he has put my friend life in danger. He is going around enforcing the pimp rules by asking girls \"did you get permission from his pimp friend\"... I was terrified and he is letting this person that I want no dealings with know when I come to the establishment. I don't want a PIMP! I don't want to be trafficked and I got threatening last night by PHILS friend saying \"he will get someone to f*ck me up\" because Phil tell him when I'm there, I obviously stopped talking to that person for a reason so Phil putting my life in danger is unacceptable... I will be taking legal actions against this establishment since they didn't seem to care that their employee is intimidating girls for his buddies just because he get a little tip money from them.  PHIL supports trafficking I have also notify my family just incase so they know it's because of Phil at the peppermill that this guy knows when I go there",

Our food was good and came out at a reasonable time. Definitely recommend this place. Another plus would be a different feel and vibe of the atmosphere",

    "text": "Um, just, no. As a Vegas resident of five + years I kept hearing that I just HAD to check this place out. The day finally came, and with expectations low, but hopeful, off we went.  The decor did not disappoint. Like a Denny's on LSD. The mildly disinterested hostess showed us to a booth. Everyone who works there appears to be about 15 years old. The menu is one of those that has every possible cuisine represented, a clue that none of it is gonna be all that great.   It was hot inside and every surface was kinda damp or sticky.  The wine list was abysmal, and the cocktail menu uninspired. Ok, I'm old and fussy, so keep that in mind.   I went with a shrimp cocktail and an iced tea. I figured if that went well, maybe I'd get something else. The hubs got a burger and fries.   Thirty minutes came and went and still no food. No one seemed to be in any particular rush.  My shrimp, when they finally arrived, were fine, five good sized ones and decent cocktail sauce. The burger was ok, and the fries were pretty good. The wheat bun however had a weird hard knob on the top that appeared to be mold. I wanted to call the server's attention to it, if only so they could check the other ones, but the hubs vetoed that.   That pretty much put me off the plan to order anything else, especially since I wasn't good with waiting another 30-ish minutes for it to arrive.   Ok, I did it, and i never have to do it again.",

The wait was over an hour long, so we knew the food was about to be ON!  Walking in, the atmosphere was very busy! Clearly this is to-go spot in Vegas. Prompt service and good food!

    "text": "Apparently, Peppermill Restaurant is a classic and historic restaurant in Las Vegas. During a birthday weekend trip, we decided to take our group of 25 people there. I like the decor and classic American cuisine. Entree meal prices are reasonable, ranging from $18-$27. Food selection and taste was average. I didn't see all the rave. Compared to all the well known restaurants, this place doesn't need to be on anyone's bucklist. If you do decide to go, here is my summary of the place:  Pros - Decor was a classic Happy Days theme.  - Accommodated our last minute reservations and group of 25.   Cons - ***Group billing*** One of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants are those who don't split checks. People it's 2019! With all of this modern technology, why can't you split the checks? If not individually, then at least as a group. It took me 20 minutes to analyze the bill, determine who ordered what and collect money. You do your restaurant a disservice if you can't accommodate groups with common customer service. (Yes, we were aware that they couldn't do individual checks. But our original restaurant fail through, so we had to go here). - Speaking of customer service. Let's talk about how we only had one server for 25 people. You cannot serve a group with one server. Being understaff is not an excuse. My utensil was filthy and had old food particles on it. I asked for a fork twice and received it in 10 minutes. So I had to watch people eat, because it took that long to grab a fork.   Neutral - Off the strip. Great opportunity to get away. It's about a 20-30 minute ride from Caesar Palace.   My recommendation would be not to waste your time. It's plenty of reasonable restaurants to enjoy in Vegas.",

I didn't get to go into the restaurant but I hear that the portion sizes are family style. Now the bar, it's pretty dark and smells like smoke. It's a very small area so the smoke really lingers.

We were seated at an awesome round booth right away.  My biscuits and gravy plate ($8.95) was huge. Actually all of the portions were huge. The coffee ($3.95 with waitstaff constantly asking to refill) was really good.  Great staff. Crystal was a wonderful waitress. The ladies wear awesome outfits. Cool colors and interesting decor. Casual restaurant for everyone. Our toddlers loved it too.  Some day I might get up the nerve to try a 64-ounce \"Scorpion.\" Just ask the lovely bartender (since apparently it's offensive to call them barmaids now?) what the ingredients are.

It was our last night in Vegas so we wanted to make the most of our time.  We were not drunk, inebriated, but just tired at this time of the night.  We were well dressed.  But when we came in, because of our age (everyone else in the diner was in the mid 40's or older), the manager at the time immediately came to our table and asked if she could help us.  This would've been fine if she didn't scrutinize with such a discriminating look.    Setting is really old school and retro, and every time I visit, I'm equally impressed.  The waitress was also barely came to our table and wasn't very warm.  The portions are huge and easily shared between two people, with leftovers.  Food took a while to arrive though, despite being in such a quiet hour of the day.  We got the hot pastrami sandwich with onion rings.  This wasn't my first time here and I'm sure it won't be my last.  The prior time, I just came here for their ridiculously portioned banana split sundae.",

Let's start with the wait.. .oh hell yeah there's a wait about 1.5 - 2 hours, yes it was that packed and we didn't get to actually eat until about 1:00 pm or so.   We decided to take our group of 10 and sit in the Fireside lounge...This gem is so hidden that we didn't even know until about 30 minutes of waiting outside.  Lets start with the FIreside Lounge - Think Super fabulous 70's, neon Lights, water / fire pit, ultra comfy seperate seating areas, did I mention the Scorpian( also featured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations) yeah that ones a rough one- its super huge!!!  My friends and I all started talking on why we haven't yet partied here and enjoyed getting drunk at the lounge... really why haven't we? Next time my friends next time...  So we get called to sit down to eat, the ambiance is like the old 70's/ early 80's charm again but with faux trees and neaon lights and faux plants through out... charming.  We get an amazing server, Jennifer, well we are told the portions are huge, in hearing that and then actually seeing the items delivered to the table - thank God we listened and we shared plates!!!  Breakfast menu is really off the chain here! we all took bites off each others plates to sample the menu.. so not disappointing at all eveything was great!  Chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, Joes grill breakfast thing, biscuits and gravy it was all scrumptious.  After inhaling most of my food we were all pretty much full and decided to walk up the strip to get back to normal after the food coma we just endeared.  It was D LIsh and I will be definately coming back on my next trip to vegas, maybe after the breakfast rush..",

A 70's neon vintage diner, which includes purple velvet booths completing the groovy vibe is the Fireside Lounge/Bar in another part of the establishment. Where else can you find a circular fireplace? Let's just say this is a stationary limo where the choices of specialty cocktails are abundant.  As awesome as the ambience is, let's get down (no pun intended) to the real reason this place is a must in spending time in Vegas. The food is great. Wide selection, huge portions (A-muuuur-ri-cuh), and ridiculous affordable prices.   \"They\" say that Vegas is a  24 Hour town, but that is sooo wrong, especially when you're in the city with friends and pull a Strip Crawl and need something to sober you up at 3 or 4 in the morning. Peppermill is open 24HOURS!!!!   If you're on a budget this is the place to go to indulge.",

During our 30min wait we hung out at the Fireside Lounge. Man that place is awesome - I felt like I was signed up for a lapdance w/all that fluorescent lighting, fake plants, plush seating and scantily clad waitresses.  We were finally seated amongst all the hungover frat guys and huge families who took over the place. Our waitress was very nice but the overall service was sloooooow. Our food finally came and we devoured our bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, english muffin and hashbrowns. I was almost angry at how good it was and how it was going to end soon if I kept eating. We got out of the place after about 2hrs - an amount of time unheard of from us, again I'm blaming how busy the place was and slow service.  Anyway, the Peppermill was a great place for taking your time, eating yummy diner food, people-watching and chilling - all without having to inhale cigarette smoke.",

I saw my idol Tony Bourdain meander his way here and I was hooked. I took my first glance of the Peppermill's interior and I was obsessed. Am I a coke-fueled old school glam slam Vegas princess? ...Maybe. But I sure do love this place!  The food is generally hit or miss, but believe you me the portions are GIGANTIC. You should either probably split a selection with somebody else in your party or prepare for a ridic amount of leftovers. You have been warned.  My two favorite dishes here are the seafood omelette (Mediterranean I think it's called) and the Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs and all the fixins. Again, we aren't talking Michelin-star quality, but the ingredients are definitely fresh, plentiful, and made to your liking.  But the absolute best part of the Peppermill? C'mon... the entire joint is draped in mirrors, fake foliage, year-round multi-colored Christmas lights, neon trim lighting, and a dark carpeting fit for a fab downtown casino floor. The lounge itself -- which looks deceivingly large thanks in large part to those mirrors -- is a trip, and definitely one of my top ten Vegas landmarks in my heart.  That single fire pit is captivating, sexy, mysterious, and gaudy all at once -- and I promise one glance and a slippery lil drink between your fingers, and you'll fall truly madly deeply in love like I have. Everyone is also very sweet, and although some have mentioned the spotty service, I've experienced nothing but the utmost courtesy and efficiency.  Don't let the place fool you. Get in here, be prepared to eat, be especially prepared to fall head over heels for the Peppermill. My kinda Vegas.",

    "text": "This visit to The Peppermill was about a year in the making as an out of town friend had given it 2 thumbs up & suggested we meet there. So I had alot of time to review the extensive menu which covers pretty much the full gamet of what you'd find at a Dennys (Breakfast, Sandwhiches, steaks, fish, burgers, deserts & Full Bar) but more Upscale.  I had also viewed several Youtube videos, one which featured the Mammoth \"SCORPION\" Cocktail ($20) & that pretty much sealed the deal on what I was going to have to drink. The Scorpion came just as it was shown on the vid and was very good wt no hint of any liquor at all which was strange because if you look up the recipe its loaded with alcohol. I am a vodka drinker and I'm guessing it was the 151 in the mix that had me done drinking anything else & sweating bullets towards the end of the visit. It packs a punch.  The Bartender in the Fireside Lounge was very freindly & had a good sense of humor especially when I pretended to have poked my eye out on the long straw that came with the drink and demanded someone call Personal Injury Attorney Glenn Lerner. The Bartender immediatly offered up some scissors to cut the straws to a shorter more manageable length.My accomplice had a glass of White wine ($9.50).  After conversation over our drinks and very hungry, we went into the main dining room and were immediatly seated in a nice out of the way booth in the back that was big enough for a group of 4 so we had pleanty of room to spread out and make ourselves comfortable.  I ordered the 1/2 order of Nachos wt Chicken ($16) and my Partner in Crime had a salad, Shrimp, and steamed green beans ($20) which looked very good and she had no complaints. The Nachos on the other hand were somewhat of a dissappointment. I have definatly had better. The quantity was overwhelming & in fact wt my huge cocktail, could not finish them. My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.   The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.  The waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others. Go to youtube and see the various vids there. The breakfast dishes look very good as do the burgers. 3 out of 5.",

The entire place is bursting with color. Feels like you're eating on the tail of a peacock. Sensory overload for an introvert like myself.  The food was ok.  I somehow expected it to be really good.  It was just ok.  However we were busting with mediocre food by the time we left.  Portions were generous.  I probably won't be back but glad I went once.",

Well when you TripAdvisor or YELP anything food 24 hour in Vegas the Peppermill is #1. It's historic and legendary amongst Vegas locals. The exterior was a sight to be hold and the inside was even better.  Trees, booths, lights, sights and sounds of the Vegas nightlife crowd. After a long day of hanging out, walking, shows, the Peppermill was a comfort to say the least. The food was the best part, now you must get steak and eggs, DOH! It was simply the best.",

There were only a few unoccupied tables and we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. Service is top notch from being seated to the end of the meal. Our server followed up periodically. The veggie omelet was large and comes with hash brown potatoes and a choice of toast, muffin or bagel. My omelet was perfectly cooked. The veggies were al dente and the eggs fluffy. The hash browns crisp on the outside and soft inside. Just a great breakfast.  Being from the northwest side of Las Vegas I would not drive here to eat but if you are in the area or to bring some out of town visitors, the Peppermill is the place to eat on the Strip.",

If you are a chicken fried steak fanatic and love eggs cooked to order it's worth the stop. If you're claustrophobic, don't like crowds, are frugal and hate to wait...it would be a pass. Average wait time during peak breakfast is an hour jammed into a sardine can hostess area. Food was solid, but probably wouldn't be back.",

Bear in mind, it's essentially an upscale diner.   Went back a few days later for brunch. Was a crowd, but I didn't have to wait for a seat at the counter. Very large portions of french toast and such. With coffee and tip, came to about $20.  Giant menu. Check out their website for photos and menu. Pretty much what you see is what you get.  Servers range from beautiful to off-the-charts beautiful if it matters : ) ; )",

It also comes with a side of brown sugar and a little milk to add if you like.   The omelettes were HUGE! It looked like a dozen eggs went into those babies! So much food! Much cheaper than eating at a hotel and just a short Uber ride from the strip. Definitely worth it!",

We sat in the bar where we were only 2 of 7 people in the bar. We sat for over 5 minutes without any service.  We decided to try our luck in the restaurant.  We were sat immediately.  A young boy brought us some waters then said someone would be around for drinks.  We waited and waited and waited and finally flagged the boy down. Told him no one had come to our table.  Then about 5 minutes later a waitress came over short dark hair very openly irritated by our presence.  We ordered.  She came over and took sugar off our table said nothing.  When our food was up. She slammed my salad down so hard a crouton flew into my lap. She said nothing.  She came by about 15 minutes later.  Said \"all good\" then walked away. She then came by to fill condiments on our table no words spoken. Seemed odd that's not something that waitresses usually do at the table with customers. She was so incredibly rude. It was my birthday as a gift to myself I tipped zero dollars.  The food was so so. Thank goodness the drinks were strong",

When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by more neon and mirrors! If neon and mirrors is your thing, then you'll feel right at home!  I have to admit that the combination of neon and the crowds of people on the strip really does draw attention to itself. The lounge atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge is amazing. It is a very relaxing place and not too loud so that you can carry on a conversation. Whether you're going for cocktails in the lounge or looking for a decent coffee shop in Vegas - you won't be disappointed. The giant omelettes are what the Peppermill are most famous for. As far as the service goes - absolutely lovely!   Any visit to Las Vegas should include a visit to Peppermill!",

Maybe seen in a movie or a music video or just the fact that they have a large menu with large portions. The Fireside lounge is always a must see and why not sit and have a cocktail, they do have an award winning Bloody Mary table and this helps pass the time if you are waiting for a table. It still has that bright neon in a dark environment old school Vegas look that it had since it opened in the 70's. The food here is also worth the visit. I always seem to get the breakfast and nothing better than some eggs and a ham steak that can feed a family. With having tried many different breakfast options this is one of my favorite places to take friends to when they visit for that hang over remedy or just visit with friends on a random weekend.",

From the minute we stepped inside we were awed by the organized chaos that was happening in every way.  The decor is hilarious and I loved it!  Mirrored ceiling tiles, fake plants everywhere you look, old school upholstery, neon lights, this place has it all.   We were seated at the counter and as we order our cocktails we were told there would be a cocktail server around to help us.  What?  But sure enough a lady in a floor length black dress came by and quickly took our drink order before disappearing into the kitchen.  Then our food server came by  and did the rest of the work, very unique set up.  The restaurant was VERY busy on a Saturday morning and the staff was buzzing about trying to get everyone fed, paid and out the door.  We ordered the ham and eggs and the steak and eggs, everything was huge and pretty well done.  Unfortunately I had to leave about half of my breakfast since it was so large but now we know to share for next time.",

I was totally surprised with the size of the meals and how fast they serve the orders. We ate here 3 times during this trip and it's rare for me to eat the same place twice let alone 3 times. The omelette I ordered was so large I could not eat the whole thing and the small pancakes were huge and could be on a extra large plate by themselves. You must go but get there before 9 am during breakfast or you will be waiting a little bit.",

The portion sizes were huge i could have split my club sandwich with 3 people depending on the hunger factor. The coffee was good, the herb chicken sandwich juicy and flavorful and the fries crisp to perfection. I was rather impressed because its a fairly average older establishment with allwalks of life coming in and out of its doors, but they even sold me on atmosphere. Each group was given their own little booth in this very bright blue and neon signed room. I will be back to try their colossal sized cocktails and larger the average banana split!",

You can install one at the top of every dining table! =D The neon lights...the white light above your dining table...you either love em or hate em. I personally think it's freakin awesome!!! I'm sure the decor and carpets haven't been changed since the 1980s. Any person who enjoys that \"old school\" Vegas feel...you definitely gotta come here and check it out.   What is there left to be said that hasn't already been said in the past 1700+ reviews?  -come hungry. Portions are BIG. Maybe share a couple dishes between your party. You will not leave hungry. Small eaters like myself, I guarantee you will have leftovers for the next day. Or even the day after that. -this place is always busy. No matter what time of the day it is. So just be prepare that there MAY be a wait. -Located between Encore Hotel and the now shut down Riviera Hotel.  I ordered the Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta. Two big pieces of grilled chicken breast stuffed with cream cheese. Ehh....personally, I could've done it without the cream cheese inside.  Very flavorful and my dish came out pippin' hot. Boyfriend had his heart set on the Country Fried Steak dinner. He thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot! Both our dinner entree came with your choice of soup OR salad. Soup of the day (I came on a Wednesday night) was cream of broccoli. Pretty good. I will definitely be back....perhaps around lunchtime so I can try out their sandwiches. Looks promising.",

Check. \"Interesting\" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check. American-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK. Indoor firepit? Check.  As Damon H mentions, the food is \"surprisingly very good.\"  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.  The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)",

    "text": "I've eaten at the Peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff.   I have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.  After dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.  I gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance.",

    "text": "Walking into the Peppermill is a throwback to old vegas.  Its where you could invision Sammy Davis Jr or old Blue Eyes to be hanging out for breakfast or a late night snack.  Peppermill is away from the hussle and bussle of the mega resorts but sits conveniently next to the Riviera Hotel with its own easy access parking lot right off the strip.  I came here with a friend's suggestion for breakfast and it was a refreshing change from the overpriced, small portioned offerings in the touristy casinos.    Peppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in vegas.  Oh, forgot to mention they are 24 hours and offer a full bar, nice!",

They saute was not drained, so there was about 1/8th of of a cup of oil in the bottom on the bowl.  This also made the hash soggy.  If they drained the oil out before the mix with the hash and flat topped to keep the hash crispy , it would be better.  Toast, Coffee and Service was good.  Just don't order the Munch.",

The TV's are located above the bubbling water fire pit (yep, still there after all this time) but small enough to be private screens showing old music video clips.  Think MTV before it become a TV Channel.  Sorry about the lack of 5th star but they really do need to know how to make an espresso martini and not try and fudge it.

The bar maid was dressed in a black 'moo moo', our waitress had black shorts and a tropical top, while other waitresses were dressed in mini dresses with suspenders (think Swiss Miss) with pigtails. Very kitschy Forgot to mention the continual loud pages in the lounge--\"Baker, part of 2\", Jones, party of 8\"--annoying.  The food wasn't anything you can't get at any cafe/diner on The Strip.

The waitress was pleasant and apologetic and said manger will be right over when asked it to be redone. The manager there did not even come up to the table. Instead walked half way and turned around. I guess we scared him. Took them over 40 minutes (yes I was timing them) took get the food made to order. The waitress apologized and said that we won't be charged. But instead was charged for it and said the manager decided not to charge us for the \"second steak\"!! Wow!! How sweet of him not to charge us for what was a piece of jerky!!  If you charge $20 for breakfast food, it's your responsibility to make sure it's cooked correctly!!   When we do come to vegas we always make sure we eat here. But never again are we coming back here especially after this horrible experience. Very very slow service. Turned our good day into a horrible one. I recommended this place to a few friends but I'm sure they will read this and stay away from here.",

Upon being seated, we were immediately asked what our drink order would be. We decided on the Scorpion (64 ounces of their specialty drink which includes Grenadine, Rum, and Brandy). We were quite buzzed once our food arrived *insert thumbs up emoji*  The portion sizes are surprisingly large. Between the two of us, we had the Marco Pollo omelet (chicken, spinach, lots of garlic and cheese) with potatoes and a blueberry muffin on the side, and the chicken nachos. We tackled as much as we could but both ended up with full to go boxes. We had prompt service and our food was prepared and served with lightning speed.   After dinner, we wandered over to the Fireside lounge. There were a few people scattered about, but we still snagged a prime seating area next to the indoor fire. We finished out Scorpion drink there (yeah, we kinda nursed that luscious 64 ounces), hung out and people watched. This place attracts crowds of all types, and feels retro glam Vegas-slash-old strip club lounge-slash-breakfast dinner. My kinda place.",

About 30 minutes into our wait, we found seating at the bar.    The perks; the food portions are enormous!   They're known for their traditional breakfasts - pancakes, waffles, sausages etc. I ordered the crab benny.  Hubby order pancakes.  My order came with THREE eggs & was entirely covered with a \"hollandaise\" sauce that had a slight curry flavor.  Way, way too much sauce for my liking. I couldn't taste anything but the sauce.  Hubby was happy with his pancakes.  The folks next to us, who we struck up a conversation with, ordered the pancake combo and shared!  It was huge!  One sausage link is twice the size of what \"normal\" restaurants serve.   I would stick with what their known for.  If I go next time, maybe I'd follow \"The Munch\" recommendation!  Ps. You can call ahead for reservations.  I would be safe and plan a day or two ahead.",

    "text": "Why is a decent salad so hard to find in Las Vegas? Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: \"Man, I would love a good salad.\" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)  Following some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.  In addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a \"romantic flaming pool\", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it \"heaven\".  Insiders tell me that around 5am is when the best people watching occurs, but if you can't find an excuse to go at 5am, you should still find an excuse to go sometime.",

We ordered long islands which were so good! We both ordered a meal with omelets and they were amazing! You get plenty of food and the wait staff was very nice.  There is a lounge inside and we did check out after a night out at Tao.  If your close def stop by this place!",

We ate there two days in a row. Both days we sat at the counter because the wait was 20-30+ minutes. They have giant coffee cups which was great - no waiting for refills. Atmosphere is great - old school neon and such. You can even have a cocktail with breakfast. Go it is work the wait.",

I went there on a weekend with my husband, and we had to wait about 35 minutes around 11am. There were a lot of tourists there so the wait wasn't too bad. Although I was starving...  My husband and I shared french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. I thought the french toast was okay, but my husband loved it. Everything else was pretty good. The coffee was really strong, but I love strong coffee. The atmosphere is definitely interesting. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very friendly and pretty attentive. I would go there again, but it's a 20 minute drive from where I live, and I like sticking closer to home. If you're on the strip visiting, I would recommend it for an early morning after party place. There seemed to be quite a bit of people there that looked like they had a rough night.",

    "text": "Let's say a Greek restaurant/bar and grill style eating establishment went to a strip club, got wasted, had a one night stand with said strip club, and knocked the strip club up. Well, Peppermill would be the love child.  This casual dining restaurant on the north end of the Strip between the Riviera and Encore/Wynn is... kinda strange when it comes to decor.  The place is super dark, with black floor to ceiling and then neon blue and pink lights accenting just about everything. I was uncertain about actually eating here because the decor just does not evoke the kind of restaurant it actually is.  As for the food, it's definitely above average, family restaurant fare. Lots of breakfast items available all day long, plus a long list of sandwiches and the like. I treated myself to a plate of nachos as an entree since I had been craving them all week. They were among the better I've had, with real melted cheese on top, although they did go a bit overboard with the beef. The people from my conference I was with seemed to enjoy their cheesesteak and burger as well. It probably won't be the best you've ever eaten, especially if you're from a bigger city, but it's pretty darn good.  The service wasn't so spectacular. Our waitress wasn't very attentive and had this attitude about her that wasn't so much pleasantly refreshing as it was, \"I have better places to be than here, but that isn't your fault so I'm not going to be outright mean.\"  And the prices, definitely higher than comparable places not in Las Vegas, but still far cheaper than most of what you'll find on the Strip. And the portions are pretty huge. I couldn't finish my nachos, and I had barely eaten anything else that day up until that point.  So yeah, it's far from perfect, but it's a nice place to eat when you want a good sit down meal, but are sick and tired of being fancy on the Strip.",

They have a full menu with pretty much everything you could want and the specialty drinks are quite special indeed and will always draw attention.

When the salads came.. it really looked like 3 salads combined into one serving. Miyoko ordered the steak and mushroom salad that looked tasty.. Markus's salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it. All of us were shocked of how big the portions were. I ordered my cheeseburger well done.. but it came back a bit burnt. I still ate it, but was a bit sad that it had been charred.   All in all a good place to grab food. Especially since I heard the Riviera had crappy food joints to eat at. Would I eat here again?

One of our party couldn't even get a refill on her coffee, she got up and had to get it herself.

Since im not an asshole who likes to make people sick i guess ill just never eat here.. thanks for nothing peppermill!!",

I tried the Chicken Parmesan, and it was tasty. Wifey had the Chorizo and Eggs...always good here.",

At Peppermill the hash browns may as well be newspaper shreddings. The entire table's resounding opinion was that the food was collectively mediocre. It was actually overwhelmingly mediocre. In fact, it reached new heights of mediocrity never before known by man. It's almost worth exactly one and only one visit just to witness this feat, but then again you could just go to Denny's and have better hash browns. The all-female cast of waitresses were lovely, friendly, and patient--even beneath the sad fact that they were just as much a part of the diner's decor as the array of indoor plants. I'd never specifically choose to go back to this diner, but it also didn't make me violently ill, so eh. Update: I had to return to add that 3 out of the 6 of the party I went to this diner with ended up with mild food poisoning. I guess that shifts the balance from \"mediocre\" to \"dine if you dare\".",

I don't know why but they have them so indulge!  The fireside lounge, on the other hand, is where it is at. Fake fire places, neon lights, velour couches, massive frozen drinks bigger than your head, and a cheesy ambiance beyond anything you could possible imagine truly define the scene. Check out the pictures if you must but instead, just go there and experience it for once. You may regret it but it is still worth it!",

The pink and baby blue lighting illuminates the resturaunt, embodied by floral tree decor. Let's get to the point shall we, QUALITY is the underlining tone in all of this. Fresh ingredients are used, along with high quality food that you can taste.   If you are trying to hard to find a good place to eat for a great price, look no further. There's plenty of places you'll over pay on the strip and can't even match the quality of their burgers and breakfast. This will always be a staple for me when I'm in town for one of my meals.",

I mean, one time, I sat in a booth right next to Jerry Seinfeld and George Wallace. I'm tellin' you - this place is a Vegas landmark.  Their menu is a pretty classic diner menu. Think of a little higher-scaled (but not TOO high) than Denny's, with hamburgers, soup, salad, steak, ice cream for dessert and everything in between. All HUGE portions. Including the drink menu... I recommend trying/gawking at their drink called the \"Scorpion.\" Overall, decent prices for decent food.  Unfortunately, service can vary... It depends on when you decide to stop in. Some nights, I've been seated and served with a smile almost immediately. Other nights, I was left hanging for a while in an otherwise quiet restaurant. Regardless, push past that aspect and enjoy yourself. The Peppermill is open 24/7 and is a great place to end up.",

The omelet came full of shrimp and cheese. I found no crab. I asked them to remake it. The waitress spoke to the manager. The manager told her no, that they would not remake my omelet. They would take it off of my check. But I was then left with a half made omelet. I highly doubt I will be returning. I don't recommend this location. What a downer.",

Its very dark in here.  The menu was big and a little overwhelming as there were so many options.  I ended up getting the Biscuit and Gravy.  The portion is so huge.  The Biscuits were made perfectly as it was moist and soft.    I really enjoyed my meal.  My hubby ordered the Chicken fried steak and eggs with a side of the short stacked pancakes.  He thought it was just okay.  The service here wasn't that great.  We always had to flag our waitress down if we needed something.  Our experience here was so so.",

Was super friendly, maybe a little tooooo friendly lol but he was okay...  Food wasn't super hot/fresh when we got it, but nothing to really complain about, we were hungry!  We would go again.

They were great company and gave us some awesome recommendations of new restaurants to check out while visiting. Our lively conversation definitely matched the lively ambiance of the restaurant. Imagine waking into a strip club but instead of strippers, you have diners. Even the sugar here is very colorful.   Mink doesn't eat much so she found something on the menu that was just her portion size. Unfortunately our server told us that it's only available for kids and seniors. I felt that he could have made an exception but he didn't. Mink ended up ordering from the available menu and threw away 80% of her plate. What a waste. Positive note is portions are generous here. Mel C said they use 10 eggs for their omelette.   I ordered their French Dip with a Hot Tea. There is no photo because they took forever to bring my order out. Everyone was eating already and I was hungry so I dug right in. Sandwich was decent and onion rings weren't too greasy. The au ju it came with was average. Meal was a little greasier than I'm accustomed to so my stomach was definitely not a fan.   Customer service was decent but lack of professionalism when we asked to have a group photo taken. One of the workers kept pushing our photographer while she was trying to take our photo. We ended up with some blurry photos. That concluded the evening so it left a negative impression of this establishment. 5 star company but unfortunately that can't be said about this restaurant.",

Huge menu of options, with breakfast available all day! Kudos! Portions are huge, quality is good and prices are reasonable. Service is fantastic even in a busy and fast paced place as this is around dinner time. Unique and positive vibe at this place. Part diner, club, speakeasy and lounge all in one is how I put it. Love the nostalgic feel it has with counter seating and retro lighting. Even the server girls all decked out in blue skirt aprons. These girls can hustle let me say that! Always on the move!  Club sando I got was amazing. Added ham, avocado and extra bacon. Came on toasted sourdough by request. Huge, delicious and filling! Sweet fry upgrade for a buck and worth it! Sweet fries rule!   Carrot cake is my one and only top cake of choice. Im a nazi with judging carrot cake quality! Theirs is good yes. Not $7 good but its a nice sweet ending to a good meal.",

Peppermill is high on the list of fabulous diners serving great food. Open 24 hours it is guaranteed to fill your dining needs.   The place is beautifully designed in my favorite jewel tone colors right down to the sugar crystals. There is an indoor fire pit with water features and Elvis videos that I am dying to go back and hang out in before I order some more delicious food.   Got to see the neon sign before it is retired to the @NeonMuseum. It's being replaced with LED.   Our waitperson was informative and friendly. Serving there for 35 years. I don't know about you, but I've never done anything for 35 years. We ordered the Swiss mushroom burger that came highly recommended by my Bae. I ordered it with fries, he with onion rings. Devine.   High on the list of places to return to when I get homesick for my New York diner fix or after a night in LV!",

The dining room and Fireside Lounge. Both sections have neon lights glowing overheard. Fake trees are planted throughout. The bright colors and borderline cheesy (and amazing) decor make this place an experience in itself.   I usually sit int he Fireside Lounge. Red velvet booths make the visit feel incredibly comfortable. They have a large list of fancy cocktails. I'm not a huge fan of super sweet drinks, but they made a Mai Tai slightly less sweet for me. We also ordered wings and a loaded potato that were pretty amazing for bar food.   I've also come with my niece. We sat in the dining area, of course, and ordered a massive ice cream sundae. It was definitely made to be shared between four adults, so we had lots of leftovers.   Peppermill is definitely an experience. The food is good (not amazing), but the service and environment are completely unique.",

Since I haven't been to the restaurant yet, I was pretty excited to go check it out.   The restaurant was decorated like a strip club without the poles. It was colorful and packed with people. I ordered steak and eggs and also crab cake, slave girl got the crab cake benny.   The benny was OK. I actually didn't try it but slave girl said it wasn't bad.   I asked my steak cooked to medium rare and it actually came out right! My only issue was part of the steak tasted bitter. Don't ask me how, but it did and I had no idea why. The only thing that really pissed me off was, I asked for over easy on eggs and it came out scrambled.  The crab cake was actually forgotten, well, not by the kitchen, but by our waitress. It came with 3 pieces and it was actually very tasty.  The service was shit. We got no water even after we asked for water. Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her over like in a Chinese restaurant. She forgot my crab cake and screwed up my egg order. When we were ready to leave, I couldn't get a box to pack my food since she was no where to be found. When I finally got up to get the box myself, our sever saw me and stopped me. She told me to return to my seat and would bring one to the table. THEN she came to the table empty handed, wtf? That was when she told me she wanted to pack it for me. At that point I didn't want to have extra stuff in my leftover so I asked for the box, again.  Peppermill, just because you were in couple of movies didn't make you god. Count me out for life.",

We read that this place was popular with Sinatra and company, so we kind of expected to see some photographs of them in the restaurant - we did not.  Service was good - would have been great except food arrived warm not hot.  My wife and I ordered the ribeye steak.  They seemed a little smaller than the advertised 16 ounces but were still ample size.  My wife's steak was nicely marbled and came out tender.  Mine, on the other hand, was dry and very tough.  Also, neither steak was particularly flavorful.  $34 for a steak is not expensive for Vegas but we expected better.",

On our way there, we were trying to decide what to do with our time in between the restaurant & the airport but that all changed when we stepped inside.  It was packed, like sardines in a can packed!  This restaurant is on the end of the strip, across  from Circus Circus so I was surprised to see how popular it was!    For Sunday Brunch, our estimated wait time was 45 minutes but they said it could be longer.  You can wait in their Fireside Lounge where you can order drinks or if there is space, play a few slot games in the front.  After waiting close to 45 minutes & our names not anywhere close to being called, we overheard someone say that the bar served the full menu & is open seating!  What!  So we ran on over & immediately got served.  They have such an extensive menu, basically everything you can think of for breakfast, lunch, & dinner.  All of their meals are huge!  I would definitely share or come extremely hungry.  Mud Pie Ice Cream Cocktail?:  Very good! Eggs Benedict, served with hash browns:  Substituted for regular bacon.  This was a hearty plate!  Your traditional eggs Benedict but with 3 eggs!  A heavy load of hollandaise sauce.  Chicken Fried Steak, served with hash browns & a blueberry muffin:  Hearty!  I loved the muffin, so moist.  What killed me was the slab of butter for the muffin!",

We arrived on time but there was a lady there taking her sweet ass time since I guess she knew we were waiting on her and ended up waiting like 20 minutes to be seated. They only had one waitress waiting on our table. I would of thought they would of assigned two people since it was such a large party but no. She was actually on it and gave us great service wish I could remember her name. The food was good huge portions. Kids pricing is about average. I felt like my shrimp fettuccine and red pepper pasta was a kind of pricey. I got a bunch of noodles and like 6 shrimp. Overall everything tasted great. Only thing I didn't like is that they wouldn't let us split the check per family but hey we were a big ass party. Would definitely come again. If you're on a budget this ain't the place for you, you can share a plate though they serve you lots of food.  PS my Husband won $20 on the poker machine !",

Mozzarella sticks, onion rings, chicken fingers, it was all delicious.  I got myself a pastrami burger.  Just how it sounds, a huge juicy burger with a nice heap of pastrami on top.  Absolutely wonderful, and completely filling.  I did leave a few bites and some fries, I'm sorry it was big.  The place is great though.  Lots of parking, but it does fill up.  Not too far from the hotels, but walking back might be a problem with that food coma coming on.",

    "text": "Mixed emotions about this place. A Lyft driver told us about them so we gave it a whirl. It wasn't really close to our hotel but the yelp pictures we saw made it seem so much more elegant than it was. The outside of the building looked pretty outdated, but I didn't want to judge a book by it's cover. At first glance it reminded me of a cheap diner. We walked in and told it was a 30 min wait for a table of 3. In the meantime, we went to the lounge to wait which is what really lost me. It was super dark, the tables were dirty as well as the velvet like booths. It just looked dingy and dirty, but the fire they had going was beautiful! Our waiter came and asked us what we wanted/clean the table as soon as we sat down... Of course we didn't know what we wanted as we had just gotten there. Probably took her 20mins to come back and right after we ordered our name was mentioned over the intercom. After getting our table she closed our tab and we moved over to the dining area.   After all that, why am I giving a 4 star? Because the food was great! Big portions, and amazing tasting food. We got the platter for the appetizer so we could taste a little bit of everything and it was all good! After that I was full so I just did the turkey sandwich which was also amazing. Although the decor and the dresscode through me off, I'd still return.",

When visiting Vegas, my friend and I were told Peppermill was a place we had to go while in town, so we made the trip over from The Strip for breakfast.  The restaurant itself is really different, but in a good way. Interesting lighting and decor. It's very much a diner but with the feel of a lounge. Quintessentially Las Vegas, for sure.  My friend had a french toast dish which was massive. She wan't able to finish it but she loved the food. I ended up only ordering a small plate of scrambled egg whites - I wasn't particularly hungry - and those were good as well.  Really cool unique diner. I would return the next time in Vegas, this time when I'm hungry so I can really try the menu.",

My daughter ordered a kids meal and I ordered an adult entree. My entree came with a chicken noodle soup. It was good. So good, that my daughter ate that and was full by the time her own food came out (which was a ridiculously huge portion by the way). I had the New york steak dinner with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My mashed potatoes were awful. My mushrooms were too garlicky, unedibley garlicky and my steak was plain. Lucky for them that is how i like my steak because it has no flavor, none. my aunt had some kind of fusilli pasta with pancetta and tomatoes, which was very good. the best thing anyone at the table ordered actually. and it was way overpriced for what we got. I know the portions are huge, but i would have gladly had a smaller meal with a smaller price tag. half of our meal got tossed because we couldn't finish it anyway. live and learn.",

The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.  The food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.  Bottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it. As far as the peppermill (fake retro) big disappointment, but I might try again possibly at a more reasonable time. I recommend it at least once in your life but keep you expectations low.",

The last time we went was a Saturday night, but there wasn't a wait and many tables were empty, so they weren't slammed. It took over half an hour to get our simple orders of a club sandwich, burger and omelette. The iced tea was stale. The burger was cold, sent back to be put under the heat lamps, but they made a new one, so my starving bf wasn't thrilled. Then the waitress brought the new burger with a small smattering of fries. She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said \"Well, I ordered onion rings anyway...\" She never brought more fries or onion rings. This debacle reminded me of another time I ate there and my burger was frigid, like it was just pulled out of a fridge. Considering the prices for food that isn't that great, it always makes my stomach yucky and this last experience, we won't be going back. Small diners that care about repeat business and quality food will be getting our money.",

Anyways despite the shocking decor upon walking in we were kindly greeted and taken to our booth. We were promptly brought waters and menu's. I ordered the egg white veggie omelette. It was great, the eggs were fluffy the veggies were sauteed and it wasn't greasy at all! As if the omelette wasn't enough it also came with homefries, fresh fruit and toast. My friends all ordered some different variations of omelettes all which looked great and they said tasted even better. All in all experience was good, food reliable, and servers were all very nice and helpful when asking them questions about different things to do around the city.",

We looked over and saw a HUGE cockroach (approx 2 inches long) crawling across the seat of the booth. The manager quickly ushered those people out of the restaurant. I also asked to speak to the manager since we had just started eating and the manager was immediately defensive saying things like \"It didnt touch you\" & \"we're in Nevada, you know how it is\". During this time a few employees stood there, looked at the roach crawling around and walked away. Not one person cared enough to kill it or to apologize to those of us who saw it. The manager had no interest in hearing what I had to say or in trying to make the situation 'right', and actually told me \"You're not coming back here again anyway, so why should I bother to do anything\". SERIOUSLY?. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, we sent the remainder (over 1/2 of each plate) of our food back and got stuck with a $55 bill. We should have walked out like the table on the other side of us.",

So, my friend has never been here, so we decide to take a morning walk from the middle of The Strip to here (great walk). We were promptly greeted and sat, then offered drinks all in a non-rushed and very friendly manner. My friend ordered the waffles with bacon, sausage and eggs  and I got the biscuits and gravy. Both great dishes for breakfast. As soon as our food arrived, my friend fell in love with my meal. Bite from hers, a bite from mine. Our server was very attentive, not overbearing, always the perfect time to check on us. There was a moment when I excused myself to  leave the table and upon my return, noticed she devoured most of my meal!! we laughed and I ate part of hers. The meal was so good she was making plans to come back again tomorrow. Peppermill you just made another loyal fan.",

Expect the prices to be a bit high, but for a place this kitschy and for the portion size it only makes sense, and anywhere this gimmicky on the strip is going to be a bit expensive. Other than that, its a REALLY fun place, the decor is crazy fun, and the waitresses are beautiful and friendly. A great place to get a late night/early morning meal and just enjoy Vegas and all of its strangeness.",

Once inside, you definitely feel like you're creating a memory not soon forgotten.  Neon lights and indoor fake trees aren't something you find everywhere.  The menu is vast and there's something for everyone.  Here's the thing...PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!!.  I ordered the Denver omlette.  When it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes.  I asked the server how many eggs they put in it, she told me 8-10!  I use that many eggs to feed my family of 4  at a typical breakfast!  The food was good, but nothing extrordinary.  At a table adjacent to ours, we saw them deliver a fruit salad...it included an whole pineapple.  This is definitely the place to come if you are really hungry.  The disappointing thing was that the food wasn't that cheap.  Lunch for four of us was about $80.  Could have had an all-you-can eat buffet for that price.  Service was so-so.  Glad we checked it out, not sure we'd go back though.",

Let me tell you... the fruit bowl was nasty. Don't order it.  Food was great, i love the stripper theme, that's always hot for a bunch of drunk people. The worst part about this place is that no taxi's will pick you up from here so beware... come here with caution if you're drunk!

We ended up going here instead of eating at the steakhouse in the Paris, where a steak was $40.  Of course, you could probably eat at IHOP or Denny's for cheaper, but we wanted to go someplace that we'd never been to.  We were blown away by the shiny ceilings, neon, flamingo lamps, and the goofy trees all over.  I would say it's worth it just to see the decor.    They have a cocktail waitress that never came to our table, which was really annoying.  We had six people that wanted to drink, so I guess it was their loss.    The food came in shockingly vast quantities and most of us left with our plates still half full of food.  We ordered two breakfasts, two steaks, and one pasta dish and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I have no idea if we'll be back unless someone in our party hasn't seen the place, as the food is really just diner food, but it's a good place to experience if you're dying for something that is typical Las Vegas and worth taking photos of.",

    "text": "On the drive back to LA from Park City, we decide to dine in Vegas and amongst total disagreement over where to eat, Peppermill comes highly recommended to us by one of the girls who had gone rather recently. After rumors circulated in the car that Holly from Girls Next Door dines there often, I assumed it was in the Planet Hollywood or another reputable hotel. Not the case. It is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. They did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. My spirits began to rise again when I saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very Vegas. We got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. The menu is extremely long and not in a good way. Not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. Also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. I ordered a Salty Dog thinking it was a beer label I recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. My pesto burger was weird but pretty good. To top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay.   One star for decor, one for the pesto burger. 'Nuff said.",

Tress surround the private booths and there is complimentary little glass bottles of peanuts. There is also large screen tv's that show music videos and live concerts of every genre of music. One minute your watching a black sabbeth performance and the next Frank Sinatra Crooning at the Sands. We always with a group of friends have cocktails in the lounge before hitting the strip. Peppermill is now a Vegas tradition for my husband and myself.  You must at least if in Vegas  have a drink in the lounge!.

I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross.  My husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet.  The best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks.  I give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas decor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. Except these are not asses you'd want to see.  And then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. This place is a mess and I recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food.",

I ordered cornbeef hash crispy (WELL DONE) and it came out in a deep dish like baby poo with tomato and cucumber. That's wrong. maybe the cook had a bad day. I will go back because my family really likes the place",

The lounge in the back was absolutely awesome. Total throwback to the 70's. Loved it. If you're not hungry, go there for the lounge!",

We stayed at the Circus Circus hotel and Peppermill was a short distance away and one of the locals suggested it to us, so we decided to try it out.  The portions here are HUGE. We ended up ordering two entrees for the three of us since we weren't that hungry, but there was still more than enough food for the three of us. We ordered ribs expecting a few and ended up getting a whole rack. For the money spent, you do get a good amount of food. We ended up taking some home.  The environment itself is one-of-a-kind. They have a sort of retro feel with neon lights and booths for seating. The booths are very intimate; it's a semicircle around a table so you can see and talk to everyone.  The only fault was the service was very informal and casual. My family and I had just walked to the restaurant from the strip, so after a very long day we were exhausted and starving. When we arrived, no one was in front of us or appeared to be waiting, but the two girls at the front were chatting away with each other. They definitely saw us come in, and we were standing in front of them, but they still didn't acknowledge us or stop their conversation. We almost just left, but at the last minute they finally seated us.",

It may seem odd, but if you're getting drinks, your table will also be approached by a separate, cocktail waitress.  The menu was a little too extensive for my taste, but it could be a great thing should you want to be able to pick from breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The food was ok but to be fair, we weren't expecting much. I had the chicken quesadilla (eh); my brother had the reuben (better), and a friend had the conquest sandwich (she said it was fine, though she didn't finish it.)  Overall, a good place to know about for late night food/drinks near the end of the strip (past Encore/Wynn.)",

We were seated right away and handed some pretty big menus. We hadn't really eaten throughout the day so we were pretty hungry. Thank the food Gods for that. The portions are HUGE.  I had settled on the omelette with Feta, Spinach and Artichokes. Holy Cow, there is easily a dozen eggs there. It was so good though. I ate more than I should have. There was no way I could gamble anymore. I had to go to bed and I slept like a well fed baby. This might be my worst review because I was tired and I can barely remember what was happening around me. I have no idea what anyone else ordered. Other than my sisters were raving about a Blueberry muffin and laughing at my amusement with the sugar dispenser. No, I wasn't drinking... just exhausted. I will say it was pricey, but they make up for it by the extra large portion. The service is on point as well.",

Faux greenery including cherry blossom trees and tons of flowers give a psychedelic garden feel.  The multicolored table sugar was a fun touch.  We were seated promptly and service was great from our waitress and our cocktail waitress.  House chardonnay was decent (happy hour half price makes it taste better).  The gyro meat was straight from a restaurant supply house, but it satisfied my hankering for some lamb. Curly and regular fries were nice and crispy.  We also shared a banana split which came complete with chocolate syrup, peanuts, and cherries.  Again, nothing special but it was exactly what you picture when you think of a banana split.  A couple of girls sitting nearby took a selfie (or two or three or 500) with their Bloody Marys.  They looked like classic Marys with a celery and cucumber garnish.  They're not reinventing the wheel here, but they have solid versions of classic food with a really fun atmosphere ripe for people watching.  Oh and the restrooms were very clean and their soap smelled good. (I had a couple wines.)",

It also happens to be a Las Vegas iconic location and is the last free standing restaurant on the Strip - proper.",

    "text": "Yeah this place is still Crazy Sexy Vegasy Cool! 40 years now! It's one of the very few free standing restaurants on LVBLVD.    Crazy: Faux plants and cherry blossom trees everywhere. They got Tiffany lamps with pink flamingos...what's even crazier that it's still shiny new. The place does not look dated. AT ALL. Oh and not one speck of dust or dirt. The whole place is pristine. They've got someone assigned to sweep the carpet even.  Sexy: Waitresses still don the cute mini dress uniforms and the cocktail waitresses still wear long dresses with the high leg slits. Cozy circular purple velour booths. It all still looks like what I remember when I used to frequent the Peppermill lounges back in the day with my hot date aka Mr. B.   Vegasy Cool: Disco day glo colors of purple, pink and teal. Just the whole late 70's early 80's era theme still preserved. Fun, showy and flashy. I love it!   Oh yeah the food: Everything on the menu, served 24/7! Darn it, they didnt preserve the 70's prices but at least the prices not as high like they charge at strip resorts.But not Denny's cheap either. Our meal came out to pretty much what we pay for two lunches,drinks and dessert $40 something  ..not bad at all.  Along with breakfast, they also have sandwiches, burgers, salads and pasta.  My tradition was always ordering breakfast and a banana split late night! I still do. The serving portions are still ginormous.  2 scoops each of Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry ice cream. That's enough to share w/3 more people according to our server.   Service: Great! Especially since it was fairly busy.   We had a real pleasant time here and will most likely be back.",

    "text": "Put this on the very top of the \"Don't Know WTF I Was Thinking\" List. Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, \"Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!\" I seriously must have been easily amused and/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...  I can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, \"Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?\" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, \"Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?\" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place.   This is your basic diner/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good.   Dress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!",

The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was on par with most dinner foods I have visited. Portions were very large however. The burger and fries alone would be enough to split for two average adults.  Biggest issue we encountered on our visit was girl in the booth behind us who obviously had entirely too much to drink. So what's a great idea?  How about you give her more to  drink. 5 minutes later the patron at the other table starts vomiting all over the table. No one helps her to the restroom or outside. They just sit there and watch her. But that's not the bad part. The bad part is they just left it there after she left. Someone came out to clean it up and refused to do clean it up. It sat there for nearly 25 mins before it was taken care of. No apology or anything.",

    "text": "A local recommended Peppermill to my family on our recent trip to LV.  We went for brunch and found it was packed.  The neon lights made it look more like a strip club than a diner (I've never been to a strip club, I'm assuming from what I've seen on How I Met Your Mother...) We had about a 10 minute wait before we were seated- all of the staff were very friendly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was served with a massive amount of fries, but they had a funny taste (not sure what type of oil they use?).  My wrap had more tomatoes and lettuce than chicken, disappointingly..  My relatives ordered the french toast, which was a huge portion, and they really seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, an inexpensive place to eat with a variety of choices, but not a \"top\" restaurant by any means.",

It really is out there, by Riviera and has it's own parking lot and famous for being in several shows movies like Casino etc. Open 24 hours which is great and has a lounge/bar.  I know my mom would def. not appreciate it as it is old, not pretty and who knows if they ever dust those fake flower trees hanging over us. The couple we dined with were healthy/picky eaters so the huge portions might've been a turn off.   But we'll be back! and next time we will SHARE! corned beef hash was delish, fresh baked blueberry muffin was great, the seafood omelette was good but not too much seafood, kids meals are huge too (maybe share or skip it completely) Sampler huge. Even the salad my friend got was huge and came with fruit too. Mimosas were great!  They take a postcard pic, then try to sell you a bigger copy for $15.",

The diner is pretty small with intimate seating and the lounge is out of this world with the fire pit off the bar. Very cool atmosphere.  Service was a little slow-I mean they came out for drinks from the bar immediately but it was another 15 minutes before anyone stopped back by since we're NOT drinkers.  We ordered sandwiches and an appetizer since we were extremely hungry & didn't wanna wait long for them to re-invent something in the kitchen. I ordered the Gyro plate, the wife had Hot Pastrami n Rye and the boy wanted macaroni & cheese with Fruit!!  The food came out quickly, the appetizer was not what I expected but was good nonetheless.(could've used more bread & cherry tomatoes)  The Pastrami & potato Salad A+-Huge portion, great pastrami and fresh & tasty potato salad.  The gyros were great but the pita was a little dry. The Onion Rings were good but straight out of the freezer NOT handmade.  The macaroni & cheese was good, the fruit was fresh.  OVERALL: Good Food,OK service and Great Atmosphere. A little pricy($50 for 3 people sandwiches) Nothing gourmet but solid.",

But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking:   \"Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. \"We hate big crowds,\" Keuning says.\"You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place.\" Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers.\"  So go on, maybe you'll even spot Vegas' most famous rock band... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesponge-dani.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F10%2Fvictims-pilgrimage-killers-fans-guide.html&s=23d0e380f6eb0a47e4d13b2eda19598c2856b5f80c81f92d851b8fe6a5ea3dda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thesponge-dani.blogspot....</a>",

Just a little background...This was our 1st trip to Vegas and we visited the Peppermill based on a suggestion from my husband's co-worker.   When we first walked in, the cheap decor and tacky waitresses caught my eye. There were a few of slot machines (of course) crammed in a small corner, neon lights, cheap plastic plants, and waitresses wearing orthopedic shoes. Because the Restaurant sells drinks, they have a \"cocktail waitress\" who was dressed as if she were going to the prom (on a budget).   We were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes, it was Saturday around noon, so it was to be expected. The service here was not good. The waitress was unattentive and forgetful, however the food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I ordered to Lorraine Omelet and my hubby ordered some sort of scrambler. The food was seasoned to perfection and the portion sizes were ridiculous. I literally ate on my food for 2 days and wound up throwing it away. I ordered a pancake on the side and it was literally the size of a 20' rim.  If you are looking for great food with large portion sizes, this is the place. Although the service sucks (the lady at the checkout counter practically ignored us for a couple of minutes when we were ready to pay our bill), they make up for it with their food.",

We figured we better wait in the Fireside Lounge.   We ordered a round of drinks. About 10 minutes later, we heard a huge crash. Five minutes later, the cocktail waitress arrived with a tray of broken glasses and two intact drinks. Ah, my Bloody Mary! Unfortunately, they didn't make the other drinks in time before we left for our table. The waitress explained all the drinks spilled on tray and so she couldn't read what the others ordered. Still, things happened and we forgave her.  Meals are huge as always. I ordered the Southern Fried Steak which I barely ate half. I love their hash browns which seem like individual thin sliced potatoes. They give you way too many eggs but who cares.   I just hope the rumors of them closing down are False.",

I stopped in on the bar side after attending YSB on Sunday evening. The decor is funky and eclectic. Lots of mirrors, plants, and neon lights. Beyond that there was nothing very special about his bar. Their signature giant drink was much smaller than its reputation. A limited bar menu is also available in case you don't want to drink on an empty stomac. It was relatively quiet insided so you didn't have to yell at the top of your lungs in order to have a conversation.  I think there are better bars/lounges with better value, drinks, and food.",

    "text": "I have been to the restaurant twice.  Once for late night dessert and once for late night breakfast.  Portions are ridiculously huge, and the prices reflect that somewhat.  The food is decent, but nothing really special.  I recall my spinach and cheese omlette being pretty good though I could barely make it though half of it due to it's enormousness.  And as is the usual story in Las Vegas, there isn't much here by way of vegetarian options.  They offer a veggie burger and a salad or two and of course breakfast food.  This trip I was determined to check out the Fireside Lounge.  And I'm glad we did.  We took a seat on the cooshy couches surrounding the fire and ordered some appetizers.  It was a Sunday night and kind of quiet which was fine by us.  The neon, the decor, the fire.  So wonderfully cheesy.  I loved it.    They have a few small flat screen TVs affixed above the fire pit and they play music videos and live concerts which can provide some laughs, depending on your taste in music.  I am glad I finally checked out the lounge as I read rumors that the Peppermill may be closing with no plan to relocate.  Which would be a total bummer.  But perhaps they should move it downtown.  It would fit in well there.",

The bruschetta wasn't very good. The garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. The spinach salad was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. We were there for an early dinner. I know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order.",

I had breakfast as that was recommended to me by friends.  Pancakes were horrible.  Dry, crumbly and unsaveable even with a dousing of syrup.  Two cute little pieces of bacon cowering in a corner of the huge plate.  The friend across from me had the chicken fettuccine alfredo.  Two dry, overcooked pieces of chicken sitting on a pile of pasta and sauce that was at the point where you could stand a fork in it.  With proper fork placement you could have lifted at least half if not the whole serving of pasta at one time.  Had to go back to the Cal and have Chili rice. Well, lesson learned.  Peppermill, Check!",

Of course, the food was good too!  I had the CLUB SANDWICHES for the first time. There was a lot of bacon and ham. The bread was toasted. It was great. And, it came with a lot of fries!   The second time, my husband and I shared 22OZ STRAWBERRY MILK SHAKE. It was HUGE and GREAT!!! My husband and I loved it!   Also, I ordered CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. That was my first chicken fried steak. It was covered with gravy. It was crunchy and flavorful. The steak was so big that I didn't even touch the eggs. Haha...   I like this place. It is a nice little dinner. The decor was very cute. It is a bit off the strip, but it's close enough. I think that it is a great breakfast place with a good price in Vegas. Give it a try!",

Do I love it or do I hate it?   Cutting edge or tacky?  I'm still not sure.  Why three stars?

The trashy specialty cocktails are humorous and I usually order one just to get in the Las Vegas spirit (I had the Bacardi O Dreamsicle last time). I recommend coming here for drinks and appetizers - the infamous fireside lounge is the coolest part of the building, if you can get a spot in there. It reminds me of something out of Fourside from the tripped-out Super Nintendo game Earthbound. You have to come here at least once as, from what I know, it is THE quintessential Las Vegas trash-diner... And it's open 24 hours! I hear there's quite the crowd at 4 AM ;)",

Their omelets are out of control.  They are GIGANTIC!  It was super tasty too!  It comes with a side of some awesome hashbrowns and 2 pieces of toast.  I got sourdough and it was perfect....they even butter up the bread for you too so all you have to do is apply the strawberry jelly.  I washed it down with a gigantic chocolate shake.

    "text": "I was looking for a restaurant that wasn't a chain restaurant, buffet, or an overpriced restaurant inside the casino.  Using Yelp! app, I came across The Peppermill.  The decor is very unique.  There's a lot of neon lights, mirrored ceilings, and fake trees.  I didn't see the fireside lounge because the wait was a mere 5 minutes to be seated.  The place was fairly busy, so service was not very fast, but you can't blame the servers for that.  I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested Munch's Breakfast.  Sausage with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, topped with eggs and cheese?  Sounds great!  I was excited.  The meal came out and it felt like it was missing something.  It felt like I was eating a vegetable omelette - I realized that there was NO sausage.  I called the server over - not the easiest task when she's running around tending to many tables - and she said asked if I wanted to have them remake it.  I told her no since the person I came with was almost done with her meal.  She later brought out a plate of sausages.  Apparently the prep cook forgot to bring out the sausages and the cook just threw everything together not realizing that the sausage wasn't there.  I realize that mistakes happen and it wasn't the server's fault so I didn't tip her less than I would have for the service.  But I wish she addressed this with management so that they could have made some sort of adjustment for leaving out the sausage.  Seriously, that's like giving someone a car without brakes.  A chair with no legs.  A hooker with no condom.  All of the above may work but leads to an incomplete and potentially regretable experience.  So while I would probably have given this place 4 stars, I have to give it 3.  Give it a shot, but realize that the cook may be high and leave out key ingredients.",

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the service was a tad lacking.

    "text": "My wife and I went to Peppermill Las Vegas for our 11th Wedding Anniversary celebration. Our plan was to spend a couple of hours for our dining experience. We were promptly greeted by several people who were trying to make our dining experience amazing. We were promptly brought bread and menus. My wife ordered Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta which was amazing. I ordered the Ribeye steak, medium. It was brought to me cooked medium well or more done. My server asked to take it back. When she brought it back, it was cooked properly but was about 20% gristle and fat. The menu price listed for the steak was $32.95 but I was charged $36.95. Our out price was almost $90 and the main course of my meal was not only aweful, but by the time I finally received my properly cooked steak, I only had time to cut the fat and gristle off of it but not enough time to eat it because of an event that we had planned. The server was awesome and very apologetic. A nice lady came by and took our picture and gave us one with a very sweet note on the back.  Although all of the people were very nice and the restaurant was very welcoming, the overpricing from the listed menu price and the terrible and very expensive grisly and fat steak will keep us away.  Thank you, but NO THANKS!",

Plates are huge, split if you are a couple! Breakfast is the real deal, go early or the line is out the door! Saturdays and Sundays are only for the ones with time to waste as the wait can be an hour. Once seated they move it along pretty good. We tell everyone about the place and even take new folks if we can to spread the word.",

I purposefully went looking for somewhere to go for my 21st, and I loved all the photos of the outside and inside of the Peppermill. When I got there, I was not disappointed by its looks. Sure, some may think its too \"vegas-y\" or tacky but I really enjoyed the uniqueness.  As for the food, the portions are large but finish-able, I had a pancake breakfast for dinner and my boyfriend had the fish and chips (curly fries) and we were both happy. I tried a mai tai and it was pretty big and delicious, though I can't compare it to other mai tai's as it was my first drink.  The staff were very helpful, and we even got a free souvenir photo!   If you're going to Vegas, I'd definitely stop by at least once (or twice). Also, LARGE parking lot!",

If im gonna spend 10 bucks for a burger and fries or 24 bucks for a steak, it better be decent and it better be able to fill me up.   Other than that, Denny's would be a good choice if you wanna save some money and get pretty much the same results. I wasnt too impressed my only visit here. I guess it would be one of those once in while places to eat. Definitely would not take anybody here unless they insist and are in possession of large amounts of cash.",

Never in a million years would I compliment bad decorating, but I gotta say, \"What a GROOVY place!\"  The atmosphere definitely makes you feel like you just stepped back into the 1970's (or early 80's) Down-chicka-down-down...  The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was worth it. The tables were booths that felt like private coves. Our waitress was really sweet, attentive and on top of everything.  I was amazed how she remembered all her tables with these tucked away cove-like booths.  (With all the mirrors and lights--it's definitely not a place where you can drink on the job!)  I ordered a salad and it was HUGE! My husband had the egg white omelette and said it was great. The coffee was fresh (We appreciated the large mugs, btw). The prices were a bit high for the diner atmosphere, but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.  Because, let's face it-- I've wasted my cash on worse experiences in this town!",

The hash browns were undercooked and tasted like warm frozen nastiness...& the omelet was totally undercooked with 0 taste.    Sent my meal back & didn't have the courage to order another meal.    Anyhow, if desperate, I would do late night run in like I do when I'm LA at 'Mels'; but not a fan (maybe just a bad one time experience).    Service was solid and other customer's meals looked decent, so again shall give Ol'Pep the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I was unlucky...  I would suggest keep it simple sin city & order basic stuff here - the bacon was good! lol",

Chicken Fried Steak was on point! Drinks were huge & reasonably price. The decor was the most brilliant, grotesque thing I'd ever seen.",

The menu is large there are so many options. I love the vibe of the place as well and the bar in the back is my favorite. The little seating areas are SO cool totally 80's and I love it! The fire pit in the water is a Nice place to sit at and snack after a long night of partying or working. Defiantly a locals spot and worth going to.",

I Googled good restaurant on the Strip and this came up high up there and I was excited to see it wasn't real expensive.  On our first visit as we pulled up I was nervous because it kind of looked like a dive, but the place is nice and clean and has a very nice staff. The food is awesome. We ordered a Fruit salad to start and it was sooo big and super yummy!  It was so big we took half back to our hotel and ate it in the morning for breakfast, and it still tasted great.  We really enjoyed our dinner that we ended up going back 3 times the week we stayed in Vegas. Everything we tried we liked.  Told everyone I know that goes to Vegas often they must try it on their next trip.",

It has a retro-look with neon lighting and faux cherry blossoms (if you ever go, you'll know what I mean).  A bit of advice if you intend to eat at Peppermill... come hungry.  It's fairly expensive for a diner-like restaurant, but it makes up for it in its ridiculously huge portions for most of its dishes.  I have never seen so many people have to request take-out boxes before.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak (since I wasn't actually all that hungry), which was good, but nothing too special.  My parents ordered a beef kabob (which was pretty tasty) and a walnut creek salad (which had a pesto dressing that just didn't agree with me).",

The menu has your typical diner type food (like Denny's as others would say), but everything seemed overpriced. I wasn't in the mood for anything else but salad, soup, & bread. I had their garden salad, mushroom cream soup, and some garlic bread. Sadly the only thing I liked much out of all three was the bread, but I didn't even finish it. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger & we had \"heard\" that the burgers here were humongous. His wasn't even big at all, and he claims it was \"alright\". However my nephew ordered a mushroom burger & his was big! I saw a few other tables who ordered the nachos (from the appetizer menu)..boy that thing is HUGE!!! I would've been down for that instead :P My other cousin ordered the quesadilla which looked delicious but she didn't seem to finish it. Most of my other family members ordered breakfast & they seemed satisfied; they came in huge portions.   Anyways, I wasn't as pleased so idk if I'm willing to come back & try something else. It just seems like a restaurant that catches your eye right off the Strip, and it lures you in.",
