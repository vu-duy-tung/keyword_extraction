First off the person answering the phone for pickup barely spoke English and didn't understand us trying to order a pick up. Then they said it would be 15-20 minutes and when we headed over at that Time we still had to wait. The food wasn't even ready.  After another 15 minutes it's ready so we left. When we got home to eat the food mine was not great- I had the pad see ew. The noodes felt like a plastic material and the sauce  was off. I personally wouldnt eat here again even I just for that reason.   It's also in an awkward location so unless you live next door don't bother making the trip. It's pretty north west a random parking lot in the corner. You probably need to know where you are headed as well.",

    "text": "As for so many other incredible \"gem\" finds, I have a trusted Yelp bud to thank for this one. Feeling under the weather a few months ago and craving spicy soup, I turned to my foodie Jedi Master, Kevin P for sage (and nearby) wisdom. Of course, he knew that this Chinatown staple had opened in our hood. Shares a car park with Smith's/German Bread Bakery, etc @ Rampart and Lake Mead.   They do deliver, but a GF was kind enough to bring me spicy noodle soup (ordered 10/10 was more Ike an 8, but hit the spot) Like the original, they are known for their duck and it is an add on in many dishes; carnivore friends love it, not my thing. Drunken Noodles are a favorite and tasty and their curries are delicious. Really love that they inquire if you are vegan when you ask a dish to be prepared meat free and their willingness to change dishes for those of us who have restrictions.   The value cannot be overstated: you easily get two meals from every portion here without compromising great taste. The decor is pretty, service is charming and on point and by now we all know the restroom is outside. Dining in is a lovely experience as the dying art of customer service with a smile abounds here.   Over the course of several months, we've  ordered them in for Board Meetings, spontaneous gatherings and take and go a half dozen times. Everyone is equally astonished at location, quality and ROI.   Almost glad to have had whatever the strange malady was which haunted my first week or so of year, as Kevin directed me to a clearly outstanding and unassuming place I'll continue to patronize and suggest to others. Now that they know me, I get my 10/10 spicy level and more. Welcome addition to the hood fo sho!  Yelp 100 Challenge",

Was immediately greeted and seated as we walked in. She even put the sun shade down for the boyfriend & I since it was a little sunny. 1 Star!  Ordered our mandatory Thai Teas, in those large beer mugs. Truly appreciate the amount of ice, some places overload it and it gets watery. Sweetness was on point too. 2 Stars!   Food came right after, Chicken Satay, Chicken Pad Thai (Spice level 6) & BBQ Pork over Fried Rice. Dear lawd, I almost blurted \"Now THATS how it's supposed to be damnit!\" So delicious!!! Chicken skewers had just enough spice and really complemented the peanut sauce. I even put the sauce in my pad Thai. And speaking of that Pad Thai, holy sssshhhhhh, it was everything & more. Spicy but tolerable. Noodles were so flavorful. Chicken was perfectly seasoned. Then the rice and pork BBQ was delicious! The man enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that comes with it while I enjoyed the sweet soy sauce. 3 Stars!  Ended the meal with Sticky Rice & Mangoes. It was really sweet, even the mango. Rice could be softer but I loved it anyway. 4 Stars!  Service was so friendly and quick too. Oh and the prices were so ridiculously cheap.   And that leads me to 5 Stars! Can't wait to try their amazing lunch special too!",

I called at 11 (right when they opened), ordered my food, and the lady said there was going to a $2 charge for delivery because they charge $1 per mile. I don't mind paying it but across the street is not 2 miles, Google maps says the place is 0.4 miles. Then on top of that they said it would take 45 mins for the food. Why? You just opened.. It takes about 10-15 to cook it, and its only 5 min drive to the office.   Instead of convenience, I'm now going to make the drive down the street to another restaurant.",

I was talked into trying the chicken pot stickers and I am glad it happened.  They were awesome.  For a place that serves food relatively quickly and at a good price I was not expecting an appetizer dish to look so appealing.  6 dumplings lined up and topped with two sauces, soy and some sort of seasoned mayonaise.  Add to that green onions and sesame seeds and what a nice treat to add to my main entree order of pad see-eu.  That was good too.  I had a craving for flat rice noodles and this hit the spot.

    "text": "We were surprised that this one was cute compared to the more hole in the wall original location.   The BF and I shared the pineapple curry with shrimp. The curry was red curry coconut base which was decent. It was a bit too tangy for me, but it was well made and had a good amount in shrimp, pineapple and veggies in it. It comes with just a cup of rice, we had to ask for another cup, which is extra per cup.   Spicy Thai noodles - think of it similar to pad se ew, but with other veggies like cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, onions in it. It wasn't very spicy though. In fact, they didn't ask us about our spice level at all, but maybe then they assumed to go mild. I should probably ask next time.   For the portions, these were cheap... a few dollars less than the average going rate. The flavor I thought was decent. I don't know what it was about it, but I rarely get heartburn and did. It was odd is all.   Service was just OK. We came an hour before their closing (20 minutes before closing is kitchen last call) and when we entered they kinda seemed a bit bummed we showed. They weren't the most attentive given we were the only ones there, but there were take out orders coming through still. I had to walk up to get my bill since the 3 people in the front were all busy doing something. The food came out lightening fast which was a plus, but also was maybe so we can get done fast.   I was confused how this place didn't have a bathroom, but I thought sitting there how weird that was. I did see on some peoples reviews there IS a bathroom. You just have to walk to it on the side or something.   There's several items on the menu that is unique to them, combined with a great pricepoint that makes it a good cheap option that's in a convenient of a area for us. I'm sure we will be back for more bites.",

We always order the soup..and last time we were shorted on broth.. They made up an excuse that they were changing the portions.. However, today it was back to being the normal portion.. I found a long, curly HAIR in my soup and not only did they charge me for the entire thing (minus a measly 10% for the inconvenience ) but they didn't even offer to remake it for me! I feel that they should have taken care of us..but there wasn't even an apology! We asked to speak to a manager but there were none on duty.. (Apparently, there is never a manager on duty! Who knows what else they do to the food?!) When we told our server that we weren't satisfied with our experience, she was rude, unaccommodating and uncaring. We told her we won't be back and that they just lost some good clients to which she said  \"Ok.\"",

Interior is pretty nice, for a grocery store shopping center location, its on the corner of Lake Mead and Rampart, but the big Smiths Shopping store, opposite end from the grocery store.   Its on the NW corner.   It was slightly tricky to find.   I asked the 'owner' I assume for her favorite thai soup, she recommended her version of the tom yum, I got it with extra fish balls and spice level 5, since my gut is killing me lately, but I was fine after I slurped this yummy goodness down.  The fishballs tasted and had the texture of scallops, I was amazed, that was a surprise. the rice noodles inside a tom yum broth with some chilis and chili oil flowing over the abiss of broth, fish balls(ASK FOR THIS!) and little bits of meat and shrimps.  My buddy had the Chix Noodle Soup and he said it was the best he has ever had.  I had to ding em up on the service.  Its seat yourself and the girl running the place, seemed very stressed out.   She was there with I needed her, barely, we had to get our own napkins once we slammed are faces into the goodness, but that's elementary for a restaurant, bring me a napkin.  Also, my buddy asked for rice and meat and she had no recommendation, she was silent, maybe it was a language barrier.  A host or something would have helped the whole service standard.  Still, the place has a great atmosphere, they are pretty fast too, and the food is different and very tasty compared to the 100+ thai places I have been too, I will go back again and again....Phob gun Reaw-reaw nee khrup ---translation --See You soon!",

The chairs, for starters, looked like they were attacked by someone's pet lion. The floors looked like they might get mopped once a week with layers of dirt and footprints visible along with the added ambiance of strewn straw wrappers and gunk galore. The rectangular overhead vent was caked with visible dust. The windows were also filthy. The waitresses sat by the counter talking to one another through the meal, so I had to get up to ask for chopsticks and for more tea. That is not really the big deal, but a family of four came in after us and were seated at a filthy table that had not been cleaned off or wiped down before they were seated. If the place was buzzing, there would still be no excuse, but the place was just about empty. Instead of socializing and ignoring the customers, the help could have made sure the tables and the floor were clean. The shame of it is the food was very tasty, but I am grateful I did not see the kitchen.",

It's good. The cook definitely knows what he's doing. Kudos to him! He earned the extra 2 stars. The only way I would come back is if we have the food to-go.

Ordered fried wontons, chicken  fried rice,  and bbq pork over rice. RIP OFF!!!! Please see my pics of this crap.... you have been warned. Wontons were burnt so burnt they are only good  for scratching itchy gums.  No meat in them but they cost 7 bucks??? Chicken fried rice was decent, the was about a tablespoon of chicken in the whole dish. But the rice was okay... so you get one star Bbq pork was flavorless and tough, real tough almost like jerky but bigger and more expensive.  I came here because the reviews were decent but now im thinking folks in this area are just used to settling for what they can get.

If you ask for something as simple as veggies added to a dish they charge a few dollars extra and throw in a couple onions slices and a stem of broccoli. The food just tastes like they use off-cuts in everything and cheaper recipes for their dishes now. There's more spice than flavor. It just seems like they've really tried to cut the costs and it's at the customers expense. Like I said I've given it a couple tries after the first bad time and it hasn't improved at all.

    "text": "One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, especially if I am looking for authentic soup. The location is tiny, and easy to miss if you are not looking for it. No special decor, no dress code. Just real Thai food at it's finest, served by people who know what they are doing.  For appetizers, I love the chicken satay, crab rangoons, and their special style of pot sticker, that is not like your classic gyoza at all. They offer Tom Kha, or Tom Yum, with or without noodle, and you also get to choose between 4 types of noodle. Also, they will totally accommodate special requests. I ordered regular chicken noodle soup, and they made it Thai spicy per my request.  My daughter loves the pineapple fried rice, and gets it every single time we go here. Its a mix of shrimp and chicken, and is not spicy like other dishes. Level 8 is my go to. It's almost unbearable, but still has tons of flavor.  My boyfriend loves the garlic and pepper entree with chicken, and a fried egg.  You can get this as a lunch special as well, smaller portion but at a great price! He gets a level 5 or 6, and its just a tad spicy. Average, if you can't handle it, you shouldn't be eating Thai food!  The curry is also a safe bet, I prefer yellow or panang. Pretty large portions with the dinner, I had to ask for extra rice.  I have never once dined here and not been totally satisfied with my meal, the service, the pricing, and my overall experience. I eventually will step out of my normal routine and try something new!",

The recipe and preparation is slightly different than my preferred satay, but it is still good.  A small peanut sauce and cucumber salad is part of the satay order and they are tasty as well.  It is in the same shopping center as a grocery store I frequent which makes it convenient, but it's not my first choice for Thai food.  The staff were pleasant and went  back to check on my order a couple of times.  The satay order was presented to me hot wrapped in aluminum foil.",

He sat us away from the door but then we had a bout five different servers come over and try and take our order when we had barely looked at the menu. We were kind of rushed. When our food came out my boyfriend tasted mine and said \"this has an interesting flavor, but I don't want to tell you what it is(he knew I'd send it back or not eat it) a few bites in I figure out that they had burnt my food and scraped it out of the pan as I found the \"char\" and saw black pieces floating around in my noodles. I just paid and got out of there. I will never be back.",

    "text": "RUN, DON'T WALK from this truly terrible neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Just about the worst service I've ever had in Las Vegas.   Each person in our party of six ordered their own food individually.   It was NOT a family-style or shared or buffet style order.   Yet they brought out the dishes one by one, with each plate brought out several minutes after the last, So no one could eat at the same time.  They also did not bring out any silverware or extra plates for people who'd not yet been served, so it was impossible for people who'd been served to share with people still waiting for food.  They forgot about my order entirely.   After being reminded twice to bring out my food, it finally arrived after everyone else had finished about half their meal.  So I ended up having to take most of my meal home, because others were done eating well before me.  To add insult injury, they then took it upon themselves to add an 18% tip to the bill, but then hid this from me by bringing me a credit card slip with a blank for a tip, obviously hoping to get tipped twice.  When we complained that the horrible service did not justify an 18% tip, they refused to lower it or remove it, claiming that they impose a mandatory 18% tip on groups of six.  The food is strictly ho-hum, mediocre, middle of the road. Nothing special about the food.   I don't judge a restaurant by the decor, but the decor in this place is truly hideous, chaotic and disconnected. There's nothing even remotely Asian (or, for that matter, tasteful) about the decor.  For a better and more authentic Thai experience in the neighborhood, with excellent service, excellent food and beautiful decor, go instead to Pin Kaow on W. Lake Mead Blvd. and rainbow Boulevard",

A sore throat brought me in yearning for something warm and comforting to sooth it.  I ordered the sliced beef Thai noodle soup bowl with wide noodles and the hubby ordered the mixed beef with ramen noodles.    I would advise the sliced beef if you're ordering this dish. The mixed beef has some mushroom looking cuts that resemble liver so for me the sliced beef was the winner.   I got it to-go.  However, if you stay in and dine.  Check your good table manners at the door and forget everything your momma taught you because this delicious slurpable broth with loads of flavor, crunchy fresh bamboo shoots and bok choy nesting on top will leave you slurping and licking your bowl dry while begging for more. That is if you can finish it-because the serving is PLENTY for TWO.  My secret:  Add some lime to the broth it will add and enhance the flavor.  Go get your noodle soup now!",

When getting the food home we noticed that the crab rangoons did not have a bit of crab in any of them. We paid $8 for cream cheese filled pastrys that were not that great. The Thai curry saved the meal. It was the right amount of spicy, chicken was tender and delicious, and veggies the perfect softness. The chicken pad Thai was okay, but my friend told me it's not as good as The brown rice Thai kitchen. All in all, this place is okay, but didnt blow us away. We may order from here again because the price was right and the chicken curry was good, but we won't be ordering the \"crab\" Rangoons again. The reason I didn't give it 4 stars was do to the service and crab rangoons. If we have a better experience next time I may change my rating.",

    "text": "I've tried all 3 locations and this location wins best decor.  The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.  Most items are $7-9 for a large portion.",

I felt like I was in the Matrix dodging bullets. If you want real Thai check out Archie's. The waitress did try to give me something else, buying lost my appetite.",

Had it for the first time tonight and tried the green curry, chicken satay, chicken pad thai, tom kha soup, and mango rice.  Everything was great- it's traditional Thai comfort food.   We ordered it for pickup, it was ready on time, and the restaurant was nice and clean. They did mix up the spice levels, and made my curry very spicy when I only wanted a spice level 1.  The to-go mango rice seemed pretty small as well.  Staff was friendly.  Pin Kaow is better, but if you're in Summerlin this place will do!",

But good thing the bf did his research on yelp when i was craving yummy soup!  This place was packed Friday night,I didn't expect this place to look so nice, it was an actual sit in restaurant that's nicely decorated.   it's a small place but the food was GREAT! prices were great too! it was 6.95 for a bowl of Beef Stew Noodle soup and it was a pretty big bowl and couldn't even finish it! Their soup was very flavorful without being too powerful.  We also tried their Pad see ew and the Chicken Panang curry. The pad see ew was not the best but it was still pretty good, and the chicken panang was okay. I'll be back to try their other Thai dishes and Soups. DEFINITELY try their soups b/c the Soup alone earned this place the 4 stars:)   One down side, there's no restroom in this restaurant so i had to hold it.. actually 2 down sides, the table got a little crowded for me and my boyfriend but i guess that's our fault for ordering too much!   TRY it!   plus the servers were really nice.",

    "text": "I have been here quite a few times now. Both as dine in and take out. We have also frequented the Thai Noodle House on Wynn Road, but once we found out this was the same one but in the northwest we go here all the time. The prices are very reasonable ($8 or so a dish) and the flavor is the same.   The decor at this location is much more modern and nicer than the original one in China Town i.e. this is casual date appropriate whereas the location in Chinatown would strike me more as meeting up with friends after having a few beers. Service has always been prompt and the food comes out quick. It has never been busy when we are here but I think that may just be lack of knowledge of this location. Which is good and bad, I like that it is not crowded and it is quiet but conversely I really want them to stay in business.    I have tried quite a few things, but I always circle back to the Avocado and Salmon Panang. I love that they give a lot of sauce, because I like using my rice to sop up all the sauce and there is plenty to go around. I also get the duck curry quite often, but what can I say duck is almost always good. I always get the Thom Kai (same as Thom Kha Ka - please forgive me if I am not spelling this correctly). The meat, even the chicken, is tender - often times at other places, even at my favorite Lotus of Siam, the chicken is dry, more than likely from boiling the chicken in the broth, but I haven't had that experience here.   This is a million times better than most cheap chinese places and the same cost as the prices are very reasonable. Although don't get me wrong, cheap chinese has its place in my little world too.  Not to mention they are in the same center as the German Bread Bakery - so if you time it right you could go to both and get morning pastries for the next day too!",

The egg rolls were, again, sizzling hot and perfectly done - crispy on the outside with soft veggies on the inside.  The Noodles hit the table next - ALMOST too spicey-hot - but that really means just right. The Pad Ped was a disappointment.  A completely different preparation from the last time we had it - the breading was not thick and crunchy, but more like a light dusting of fine panko and swimming in a thin sauce (last time it was more like a paste). Don't get me wrong, this is still a great dish - just completely different from what I had experienced prior.  I had a bite of the Three Flavor Salmon - which seemed really nice and complex.",

    "text": "This is one of my most visited Thai restaurants in Vegas for multiple reasons. The food is great for a really reasonable price. I think their Panang curry is super flavorful and that goes for vegetarian and meat added as well. I love their spicy basil leaf tofu, pineapple fried rice, and the pad thai and pad see ew -- which are pretty standard. I also really like their papaya salad + Thai beef jerky--probably the most winning items I have tried on their menu. It's got the right amount of spice and crisp on the edges, and the papaya salad compliments it well. I could go on and on because their selection is great and everything I have tried has not disappointed.   This location has a good amount of seating and is cute and spacious inside. One thing to note is that it takes a bit longer for food to come out, so not so great if you are in a rush.",

    "text": "I'm mixed on this place for a few reasons, but thought to round up based on the reason of coming here: for the food.  So on a Saturday night, we were craving Thai food in the area. It seems every place needs a reservation, even a Thai restaurant. The one down the street, I could understand as it was an \"upscale\" version of one. This place, however, seemed to be a mom and pop place that was like any other noodle houses from the LA area I am used to. Just to be sure, I called to see if they needed reservations. The lady on the phone, who spoke non-fluent English, claim I need a reservation for 2 kids and 2 adults. I had a feeling this was yet another place pulling my leg with the \"need reservations on a Saturday night.\" And yes, it was one of those spots that lied.  We showed up 10 minutes after I called... to an empty noodle house other than 3 tables occupied. Just as I thought: another place claiming you needed reservations. What was a bit of an insult in addition to that notion was the fact that this place has zero customer service! No hello, no smile, no glance. We stood there for close to 5 minutes until a staff finally said they would be with us. Ok...  Again, the place was rather empty at 6pm-ish on a Saturday, with the exception of hearing a grumbling waitress telling us to order quickly as they're backlogged on orders mainly due to deliveries. So now it's slowly making sense!  Anywho, why were we here--to grub!!!! I will say this: the food here is delicious enough that the non-existent customer service can be waived. We tried the pat see ew and pineapple fried rice: basic Thai food that can easily be botched due to catering to the \"American\" taste buds and not actual Thai. Is this actual Thai? To a point. I can tell from the seasoning that Chinese spices such as Maggi sauce seasoning and Chinese 5-spices powder were used on both of the dishes...but it made the food good! So good that the 2 adults scarfed down every piece of food on our plates. And it was not because we waited around 40 minutes after we ordered to finally eat (hey, they did give us a heads up).  Food: good Price: even better for the food! Customer Service: subpar  Overall, I would give this place another shot if I happen to be in the area. I just hope that blowing off customers own the phone claiming they need reservations when it wasn't the case does not deter you from eating at this tiny joint!",

    "text": "The food here is decent BUT the reason why I'm leaving 2 stars is because EVERY SINGLE TIME I order for delivery, the lady who takes my order does not speak good English AT ALL and there is always a communication barrier. It takes 20+ minutes to put in a simple delivery order. Insane! On top of that frustration, she gets upset with me because I make special requests (which are so simple btw) because I like my food prepared in a specific way and she seems to get overly irritated with me. Did I do something wrong by making a simple request of how I (the paying customer) likes to have my food prepared? I don't think so! She acts as if I'm difficult when in fact it's the other way around.   Here's a solution: Put someone who speaks clear English to take delivery orders.   This is EXTREMELY frustrating and the next time I visit in person I will be addressing it with the owner or manager and if they don't acknowledge this as a valid concern then you lose me as a customer forever. Not that they care but I'm making it known in case they read this review. I actually placed a delivery order today and experienced the same problem AGAIN. I will no longer be ordering from here because I get tired of dealing with people who can't speak English clearly enough to communicate effectively. Especially when I am a paying customer. If it was free I wouldn't care. But I spend $30+ every time and I get tired of the communication barrier.  Had to finally get that off my chest!",

But its cheap, close to work, and satisfies my Thai craving. My order today was way too spicy garnished with two long hair strands. Gross!  I called and spoke with the gal who knows me very well and has always been pleasant on the phone and when picking up my order. When I called she looked my up by telephone number and said, yes you come here all the time. Can I help you? When I told her what happened and asked if I could get a replacement order she put me on hold to talk to the kitchen and advised that they said they cannot replace it. The kitchen? Since when do they make the decision. So I asked to have the Manager call me as I can send him the photos. She hung up on me!!! Unbelievable! Being a loyal patron of this restaurant I am extremely disappointed. When I called back, it went straight to voicemail three times. Time to find a new Thai place in Summerlin.",

    "text": "We still love coming here as our Thursday ritual after the kids are done with their activities. Mainly, it's a 2 minute drive from where we are coming from and by this point we needs-ta-eat. It's not fancy, not grimey...perfect dining setting for our party of 6. We never ever have to wait for a table here especially because of our party size so that's another reason why eating here has become our ritual. While I still love their food and price point...I will have to say we have clearly seen a slight change in their food. My husband has been ordering the spicy Thai noodle (fat noodles) the past few times in a row because he lies to think what he is getting served was just an off night. Safe to say that isn't the case. He's been griping about why he doesn't get baby corn in it. Lol. The past 2 times he's poked his fork around in disgust because he notice that the veggie-to-noodle ratio is well, damnt...I such at math. Why did I even bust the ratio word out. Hahahha. Okay seriously though, his dish looks more like a stir fried vegetable plate rather than a noodle dish with vegetables.   We ALWAYS order the Thai fried rice and I swear the past several times its either lacked in flavor and/or on the oily side!! They used to serve it all nice to us...throwing coriander leaves on there, etc...but the serving size looks like it has reduced and no more pretty garnishments. Honestly, those garnishments whether it was a part of the dish or Truely meant to be a garnish helped made the dish taste even better.   My beef soup I would order used to have fried garlic sprinkled, enough bean sprouts and baby bok choy to make me feel veggie satisfied...but again, it's like they're skimping us short. Havent had the garlic in it in awhile, sometomes i dont even think there are any bean sprouts, and the flavor has definitely lack as well. We come here weekly for the past few years so we would know for a fact if they have started to change up ways. Considering we have been coming here for a few years and only of late have we noticed a change...I wonder if they have a new cook, on a budget cut, etc...  Bummer. I loathe when that happens. Anyway, we will still be coming in until we seriously have had enough and get fed up. Even with those new gripes, I'd still recommend giving them a shot.",

They remember me almost every time (no beansprouts) lol, and with their large  customer base that is quite a nice touch. They do however stop answering their phone if they get busy and stop taking delivery orders if they do answer. So if  you can't get through and its still during business hours just drive over  and go inside. The prices are great, it is one of the least  expensive Thai places we've ever seen.

    "text": "Thai Style Noodle House in Summerlin is amazing, really. My friends and I have been going there at least once a week (sometimes as many as 3 times a week) and every item we have ordered has been fresh, full of rich and varied flavors, and simply addictive! Should mention we all eat Paleo most of the time and there is lots on this menu for Paleo or gluten free eaters.   All the curries are great, our favorite remains the avocado/salmon (or shrimp) which we get them to add broccoli to as we require lots of vegetable intake. Also recommend the Chicken Satay, Ginger Snapper and do not miss the Pineapple Fried Rice which has such a special flavor. I have never been a fan of eggplant but do not miss the eggplant on this menu, it will blow you away!   The prices simply cannot be beat. This is high quality cuisine at a truly reasonable price.   As for the spot itself, could use some better lighting, it is just exceptionally bright. The tables are clean, the chairs really comfortable, and staff is always friendly and really knows the menu. You have to go outside to get to the bathroom around back but it is very clean. If you order take out be very careful in transport as some items are too much liquid for their take out boxes.   Love it!",

Then we finally got to order our food and it took a long time for the food to get to us. We ordered 3 entrees and 2 showed up, with the 3rd finally coming to the table 10 minutes after the first 2. An older couple asked the waiter how much longer for their food, because the wait time was too long and they were told soon. After another 10 minutes, they got up and left. A younger couple waited patiently for about 30 minutes for their food and when it still wasn't ready, told the staff that the wait time was inexcusable and then they also walked out. I might try the delivery service the next time we want to eat here, but I will probably not sit in ever again.",

The staff is Thai and they service is fast and friendly.   The food is yummy and great quality. I'm always weird about getting chicken at asian restaurants so I usually get beef. I feel like here, they are using only the breast so I get great chicken pieces in my dish. I grew up with chickens and sometimes, they were dinner so I'm picky and would only eat the breast if I had a choice.   Portions are big! Big enough for me to make two meals out of. My boyfriend and I never spend over $20-26 here. This place never disappoints us! My favorite three dishes here are the Rad Nah, Pad Se Ew, Pad Thai. Mmm...",

They seem like they just want to get people in and out, I guess there's nothing wrong with that.  Tried the chicken Satay. Nothing special, just chicken breast on sticks. No real flavor profile. The crab fried rice was salty. The Tom yum noodle was pretty good; nicely sour with just the right amount of spicy. The fried chicken was overdone; therefore a bit dry. The Thai ice tea was very good. Most places is too sweet; it was perfect here. Thus earning three rather than two stars.",

Good food quality and presentation I give a solid 9. I had the combination pad Thai and we shared a yummy serving of chicken red curry. My daughter had the Mongolian beef. All plates came extremely hot and fresh. Just the way I love it. Simply but clean presentation. Definitely one of my top 10 places to eat great Thai food.",

I can honestly say that their pot stickers with their special sauce on top are the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. I also usually get either the chicken pad thai or the yellow curry. Both are always pretty good, I wish however they would provide me with a larger container for my curry. They fill the container to the rim with the delicious curry leaving me no room at all for my rice. I always end up using my own bowl to make due.  On two occasions they did have a delivery driver available. I ended up going to pick up the food and felt so much better knowing my food was coming from a really clean place.

Thai Style Noodle House is no exception.  My party had the following: Mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, spicy string beans and pork, crispy noodles with seafood gravy.  Sweet, sweet, sweet, with a bit of MSG.  White seats with faux (?) leather all look dirty and our table top was sticky.  One star for the price as this is considered to be cheap Asian food.

    "text": "Great little place for some good Thai food!  Located on N. Rampart in the Smith's shopping center, Thai Style is located on a near corner of a lot.  Go slow or you might miss it because the place is tiny.  Really, there might be just over a dozen tables available for dining in.  But that's ok because Thai Style has no problems with doing take-out for you.  If you do dine in though don't worry, the place is nicely appointed!  New tables, chairs, paint.  Good ambiance, especially when it's quiet.  I hear during lunch is when the crowd is probably the biggest.  Came here with the wifey for a quiet dinner one night after we heard their second location opened up here near our side of town.  Really felt like the place was our own, there were only two other tables taken nearby, and on the counter was multiple orders ready for pickup.  The menu at Thai Style is fairly authentic feeling, with some dishes looking like they may have got a bit of an American touch.  We stuck with what we were hoping was simple and basic, but had a lot of flavor.  I love noodles, but really wasn't feeling Pad Thai.  We instead opted for the Pad See-Eu - stir-fried thick flat rice noodles (almost like chow fun) with egg and Chinese broccoli, all in a sweet dark soy sauce.  This was delicious.  The rice noodles with the sweet soy sauce was heavenly, and was given good texture with the addition of the Chinese broccoli.  It makes perfect leftovers, great midnight snack in front of the TV while watching Breaking Bad reruns!  We also had the Fried Chicken over Fried Rice - marinated, fried chicken breasts over a bed of Thai Jasmine fried rice.  This was good as well.  I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more flavorful, and a bit of a thicker piece.  However, it was yummy with the Thai fried rice which had egg, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper.  The rice was seasoned easily but just right.  And the portion was huge, more than enough for two people to share.  We got out of Thai Style with full bellies and some leftover change.  The bill was not bad at all, our total for two entrees, tax, and tip was under $19.  That was a plus!  We will be back to try other dishes, I really am interested in their red and yellow curries.  Thai Style runs some amazing lunch specials too, for short of $7 you can get a choice of TWO (yep, two) entree options from a pretty big list, and each lunch special comes with soup, rice, and an egg roll.  Don't want two entrees?  Do just one, and pay less than $6!  Dealio.",

However,.... there is also, nothing spectacular, and nothing amazing that I experienced. We ordered via phone for delivery,  delivery time was estimated at an hour and a half, so decided to pick it up instead.  Ordered: the Fried Snapper, didn't specify the \"whole fried snapper\". oops...... the version we got was still tasty. Ordered the basil fried rice, the duck fried rice, beef salad and the chicken pad see eu. The total bill was 41.00 and it was a lot of food. The basil fried rice was good.The flavor was there, but I ordered spicy 6 and it wasn't quite spicy enough for me. I am used to Pan Asia spice..... The Beef Salad was not at all to my liking. My husband liked it, but the flavors simply didn't jive at all.... a bitter kind of taste I thought.  The Pad See Eu was bland.....The spicy levels are low here, so don't be afraid to order high! If I order here again I will order 8 or 9 spice level. Also, I didn't order any curry..... It is hard to give a True and accurate review of a thai restaurant and you don't review any curry!?!?!?!",

    "text": "The first time we went here, we ate in and had a great meal, and I gave it 4 stars.  We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals.  Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.  During our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.  So on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.    Four vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.    We ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \"generous\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.  I guess it was too good to be True, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.  Those hopes sadly have been dashed.",

The plates have food stuck on the bottom and some kind of green mildew. We asked for a manager and they said there wasn't one on site. Then a waitress came and I showed her the plates. She said she knew about it and she knew about the Yelp review. Sorry our washing machine must be broken. What? Ever. We left without eating. OMG is all I'm thinking for up and left.

The pad thai had zero flavor.  It was like eating noodles with water as the sauce.  Very bland.  My chicken satay was so salty I could not eat it, so I took the peanut sauce from the satay and put it on my pad thai and that made it palatable.  The cucumber salad had no dressing on it, the dressing came in a little cup, but it was viscous and not mixed very well.  Dipping the cucumber into it was like dipping it in sludge.  In the past I've had other dishes that were too dry and not palatable.  Their egg rolls are okay.  The staff is really nice and they are working hard so I am hoping they can make the food better, and I hope they succeed.  I have gotten sick on the food all three times I went but to be fair I am often sickened by Thai or Chinese food so that might just be me.  But if you have a sensitive stomach, be careful.",

Your options are extensive and include all of their curries, unlike some Thai spots that really limit what they offer on lunch special. It comes with soup, rice and a fried treat, and the two picks are served in a nice sized dish. I think flavor-wise they are really consistent with the original location, and this location is definitely up the scale on the fancy factor- white chairs, tile on the wall, was that a chandelier? Although, it is odd you have to go outside to go to the bathroom.  I selected the mint chicken and green curry for my two. The chicken is minced, and the flavor was nice, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I realized I am out of Thai Style practice because I didn't remember the green curry coming with a mountain of bamboo shoots. I am not a fan of bamboo shoots, but the curry still had a fabulous flavor. Next time, I have to remember to order it with vegetables, hold the shoots. And, next time, maybe I will go double curry.",

I come here to order to-go and whenever my friends are in town. 5 stars for quality and for the bang for your buck! The staff is friendly, although quiet.  I always end up ordering the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with 7 spice level. It is so delicious and filling. I love how this dish comes with pork, shrimp, and fish cakes. It is like heaven in a bowl and great for cold days and hangovers (hah). Their basil fried rice and thai fried rice was amazing! I can't usually eat that many carbs in one sitting but I nearly ate the whole plate in one sitting. Like I said, each plate can yield about 2 meals (3 if you are a very light eater), so order accordingly. But hey, leftovers is never a bad thing either!",

I ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu, vegan style! So delicious! Made with a soy sauce and broccoli. It was just under $7. I also ordered a side of steamed white rice. It was a decent portion for only $1.25. I recommend giving this Thai restaurant a try! They have two other locations as well but I haven't been to either one yet.",

My husband ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and there was no chicken, just batter on skin.  Ewww.  Very disappointed, we used to love this place.  Either they need a new manager, or they will go out of business.  Waiters are not friendly, either.    PLUS, the bathroom is located out in the back alley!!  You have to go outside, like at an old fashioned gas station.  How do the employee's wash their hands?????  YUK!!  This place needs sanitizing!!

    "text": "I finally made it to this newer location and the first thing I noticed was the very small size of the restaurant. It's probably less than half the size of the one in the SW. That's not a bad thing cuz size doesn't matter...just as long as you can work with what you got. The decor is actually very stunning. It was decorated with all my fave elements: glass mosaic tile, high back chairs with button tufting, and a beautiful chandelier. It was an aesthetic, pleasant surprise to see a mom and pop establishment so nicely decorated.  Anyhow, I've been craving some noodles and I went with the intention of ordering the Thai beef noodle soup. From what I can remember, Thai noodle soup has a much better flavor than pho IMO. As I was looking at the different noodle soups I noticed one called Pork and Fish Ball noodle soup. Man, I am so glad I went with his one--this bowl of soup was absolutely delightful. You get your choice of four different types of noodles, i went with the flat rice noodles for my bowl. It contains pork, ground pork, and fish balls in a chicken broth. It is garnished with fried garlic, which is the one ingredient that pulls all these great flavors together so well. The broth had a nice clean taste to it with a hint of white pepper. It looks pretty simple but the flavors are so good, I didn't wanna mess with it by adding anything to it. I left it unembellished and ate it all as it came. This is one of the few noodle soup dishes that I didn't feel the need to doctor up with hoison or sriracha.  The ingredients in this soup was reminiscent of what comes in my fave noodle soup dish called Phnom Penh noodles. The Vietnamese make a version of this soup and they call it hue tieu Nam Vang but I have not been able to find a worthy substitute for my PP noodles until now.   Great prices, great noodle dishes and friendly service. So glad this 3rd location opened up so I don't have to go to Chinatown or the SW for some awesome noodle soup.",

My wife loves it, my kids love it, I love it, and it doesn't matter if it's dine in, take out, or delivery.  Always good food and always good service.    Make sure to specify you want to pay with a CC over the phone for delivery though, as they hung up after giving me the total and estimated wait before I had the chance to ask to pay with CC.

It's one of my favorite dishes here with noodle house classic pot stickers to boot!  I will say the delivery a couple of times has takin quite a while and sometimes cold when received.

I've had their red, yellow, panang curries...chicken satay and crab Rangoon...I always feel like it was good and the portions are large so you don't feel like you didn't get enough food.  I didn't particularly like the pad Thai, but I go to Lotus of Siam if I want the best pad Thai.  The convenient location of this place along with the good quality food at a value price makes it a great lunch spot or if you are struggling to find dinner after a hard day.  Service is always spot on and if they don't answer the phone just call back...they are busy!",

    "text": "Thai Style Noodle House...what I like to think of as the fast food of Thai food. I ordered the fried chicken, duck fried rice, pad see-ew and yellow chicken curry (all at level 5 spice which was perfect for me and I love spicy food). I've also prided the Thai with having such flavorful, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, chicken. This fried chicken lacked the flavor packed wings and drumsticks I'm used to. However, it was fried to perfection! The duck fried rice was good and the duck taste was there, but they are a little stingy on the duck meat. They also add pineapples, which I'm not too fond of IN my food so I picked it out.  The pad see-ew, which I explain as the Thai version of Chinese chow fun, is always good whenever I get it. I got it with beef and it's cooked with eggs and a leafy vegetable (can't really tell what kind it is). The yellow chicken curry was honestly nothing special and tasted like any other curry I've had. That said, it was still good.  I must say though, they are not stingy with their portions and the prices are actually more decent than I remember it being. For all of the food mentioned above, plus an order of wonton soup, my total came out to $38.60. If you're looking to find a quick fix to your Thai food craving, Thai Style Noodle House is a good place to go as they seem pretty authentic for a \"fast food\" style Thai restaurant.",

Another dish I enjoy is the Pad See Ew, flat rice noodle with a soy sauce based flavor and Chinese broccoli and the option of protein or tofu. A great option from the popular Pad Thai that most people are accustomed to.  My only complaint I have is the customer service. At times the service is great and other times it's been lacking. A few times we have been ignored or the order is wrong. The management needs to take the initiative to communicate the entire staff on how to handle customer service. I have a few friends and neighbors complained that the posted time doesn't correlate to the actual operating hours. I still remember we were turn down at 9:28pm and the posted time was 10:00pm. The staff member on duty told us that the kitchen is closed. This is very misleading to the public and doesn't reflect a professional business practice. I recommend that you call ahead if you plan to arrive later in the evening. Overall, delicious Thai food at a reasonable price point!  2017 Yelp Review #84",

I love how cheap the food is and everything was great. I went with what I usually get which is the S9 3 companion chicken with papaya salad and sticky rice. It was close to the price of lunch which is still great.   One of my friends ordered this crispy noodle dish which was really good. She's a regular so they also brought out extra noodles for her because she likes to take it home and make another meal out of it. For the price of it and making it into two meals I thought it was great. Next time I will come back for lunch and try a different dish.   Overall, the ambience is the same as the other locations. Nice and Asian feel to it. The bathrooms were clean and the service was great. I definitely will be coming back in the future.",

My mouth is watering just thinking about this place!  Make sure to order spice level 3 if you are not a big fan of spice, it is just enough for the flavor but not overly spicy!

There's some really good Thai places Here in Summerlin but this restaurant consistently impresses not only with flavor but their consistency and flavor from order to order. They have several things on the menu we stick to the Thai and everything right down to simple pad Thai is very good.",

    "text": "Thai Style Noodle House has tasty Thai food for a great value. The prices are low and you get  sharable sized portions.   I started off with the Appetizer combo which was about $7.95. It had Chicken Satay , Crispy Shrimp , one  Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon, Wontons, and  a tiny cucumber salad. It also came with dipping sauces (sweet and sour and peanut butter ). If I had to pick one thing off the platter the Crispy Shrimp would be my favorite . It is shrimp wrapped in a egg roll wrapper then deep fried.   I ordered the BBQ & Chinese pork Fried Rice  for $6.95. This was plenty to split and also take some home for lunch the following day. The rice was delicious it wasn't soggy and had fresh veggies in it. I've seen some places that put frozen vegetables in their rice which is a total turn off.   The service was great we had our drinks filled constantly which is important when eating spicy foods. Thai Style Noodle House is a chain so there is more than one you can go to in the Las Vegas Valley.",

After i had finished ordering(10items) i had asked them i needed extra hotsauce and the guy had told me okay. The bill came out to $82 and was told about 20-25min wait, which was fine. Ive been waiting outside for 25min and had went inside and was told 10more min. So i went back out and waited. Went to ask and was told another 10min. So by now i was getting a little frustrated because its already been 45min since ive been waiting. Then i asked and was told 1 last item was being made. So i patiently waited without complaining because by this time i was very annoyed. After the food had come out, i asked for some extra hotsauce. The guy tells me, he put 3 hotsauce in the bag. I asked him could i get some more, and he tells me, \"we charge 5 for $1\". I told him, excuse me, i just waited almost an hour for my food and not even a single apology for the food being late or anything and has the nerves to tell me he charges for hotsauce,? Mind you, i ordered 10 dishes and he put 3 hotsauce in my bag. And this guy is talking to me like 3 is plenty for the amount of food i ordered. You do understand that i just ordered 10 dishes, paid $82dollars and waited for an hour when i was told it would be ready in 20-25min, and not even a single apology, then tries to charge me for hotsauce? You kidding me? The least you can do is give me 1 hotsauce per 1 item, if not more when asking for extra but gives me 3 and tells me i need to pay? Then they start talking in chinese of whatever they are and shoves hotsauce in my bag of food. You people are a joke. Learn how to treat customers. No wonder this place is always empty. Just lost a customer and more, because ill make sure none of my friends and families ever come to this place ever again.",

    "text": "So I tried the Won-ton Soup ($6.75) and it was unique. It had a unusual fishy flavor and was notably spicy. I ordered the soup in hopes it would sooth my sore throat, but instead it gave me an unexpected punch of spicy and fishy. It was not necessary the flavor I was hoping I would get.   I have determined my favorite item on this menu is the #38 - Khua-Kai Rice Noodle ($7.25). This dish consists of wide rice noodles wok-fried with chicken breast, egg, and bean sprouts. I prefer to substitute the chicken for fried tofu. Any time I come to this restaurant I order a #38 and the N.H. Style Pot Stickers.   ----------------------------------------  Order your food ahead of time if you want to take it home because you do have a short wait time. The food is pretty amazing. They have really good Pad Thai here! Their N.H. Style Pot Stickers  are $5.75 and totally worth it. Will absolutely return again!",

By no means am I married to one Thai place, but my favorite is still probably the one by my house.  Don't be confused, though - I still enjoy this place every now and again.  We've spent some pretty good time together.  I've actually eaten here a few times but usually I get delivery to my job.  The pad see ew is absolutely delicious - the flat noodles are nice and well-cooked, tossed with a delicious sauce, chicken and plenty of vegetables (but not too many that you feel like you're getting stiffed).  The red curry I had when I was super-congested - I believe I ordered a 5 or a 6 (their spicy scale is 1-10) - and not only was it, too, tasty, but it also allowed me to breathe with its well-placed spiciness.  The pad thai is good and reminiscent of the pad se ew but I felt it lacked a little flavor as I really enjoy that in-your-face peanut sauce that, to me, is a staple of the pad thai dish.  It had a hint of a lemon flavor, which is the biggest reason I dislike the pad thai from Le Thai, but it wasn't enough to completely turn me off to the dish.  Or maybe I was starving that day.  I don't know, but it was gone pretty fast.  Each time there's certainly been enough for two meals (I just happened to really be hungry on the pad thai day) and the prices are quite reasonable.  Delivery time can vary - once I waited almost an hour while another time it was around 20 minutes.  Give it a first date - you may end up going for a second.  =)",

This was my families go to Thai restaurant but tonight was a completely different story. We ordered our usual which was pad Thai, pad se ew, spicy eggplant, and my dads soup. Our pad Thai came out and it literally looked sloppy and was the smallest amount I thought it might've been a joke. I literally had to ask the waitress for another order because that fed no one, I even mentioned it to the waitress \"can I please order another because this was unusually tiny\"  They brought out another yet charged me for both when one of them clearly wasn't even a full order. It's unfortunate because we were regulars here but honestly the way they handled the situation put a bad taste in all of our mouths. Time to find a new Thai restaurant!",

Usually places give larger quantities for dinner, but this place gives the same so why pay more for the same thing.    As for the food, it's decent, but I wouldn't say it's the best.  I prefer the flavor at archis Thai.  The duck curry had slivers of duck meat, not a lot, and they give more rice than food.  The pad Thai was decent.  Just average Thai food, if you need a quick lunch fix, it's a place to get some quick Thai food.",

The Pad Thai Noodles was yummy and the soup was on point.  Don't ask me why we ordered soup when it was 115 degrees out... lol   Prices are reasonable, service is excellent.

Tonight when my husband called he was actually hung up on and he even called them back to reorder his forgotten food and again, no apology for hanging up on him either.

The woman argued with me on the phone and told me that that is the serving size. She has no idea what it looks like but she's telling that's all I get! Mind you, I told her I'd come into the restaurant so long as they filled it up and she told me no that is the serving size! I then asked to speak to the manager and she tells me that there is no manager. Once again, here is and establishment that does a less than mediocre job. Such an easy fix this would have been. This was flat out crap service and rude on top of it! Give people what they pay for!!!! And try being nicer to your guests!",

The salad is about $7, so you get ground chicken and two small shrimp. Don't expect huge chunks of chicken breast and large prawns.  Also enjoyed the fried calamari, but it is the calamari steaks cross cut (which curl when cooked) and then deep fried without batter. It's a little more tough than your battered Italian calamari rings. I'll most likely skip this next time.  Plus is it's located across the street from Savers, so if you have time after lunch, do a little thrifting!",

One of the employees looks at my food and even said it was wrong and there was no crab. The chef came out and said he did put crab but not a lot. 3 other customers looked and saw NO crab and they would not fix my order. Their customer service was terrible to say the least. I definitely got a refund. Then my shrimp and chicken glass noodles only had 2 tiny pieces of shrimp.

The boo and I recently ordered take out from this location using UberEats. Our food actually arrived quicker than the quoted time which was nice surprise.   We ordered the crab rangoons to share. They were perfectly cooked, crispy and did not skimp on the cream cheese filling. I also thought the portion size was pretty big for the price. (5/5) For an entree I had the Shrimp Pad Thai. I do wish they gave tofu as a meat option as well, but nonetheless the shrimp was delicious. I had mine at a 7 spicy, which I didn't think was too overly spicy at all. I probably could have gone higher. The portion size on this was also huge, enough for dinner and lunch the next day. (4/5) My boo had the Pad See-eu, it looked pretty tasty and I tried a couple of the noodles. Both solid noodle dishes.   I can't comment on the service inside since we got delivery, but overall the food was very good.",

She got the Thai Beef Salad (Phone pic):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thai-style-noodle-house-las-vegas-4?select=uVyr7IuBmjyR04VMs0Gpow#uVyr7IuBmjyR04VMs0Gpow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thai...</a>  Which is served cold, marinated with lots of flavors here!  Huge portions and low prices...I think this was only $6-7??  Not my most favorite version I've tried, but it was good!  I went with my favorite dish as always, the Pad Kee Mao aka Drunken Noodles (Phone Pic):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thai-style-noodle-house-las-vegas-4?select=VeZSixXFxYJjsa2y10mYdA#VeZSixXFxYJjsa2y10mYdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thai...</a>  It was good...definitely have had better, but the taste is there, spice is hot, and portions are large and very fair at again, only $7 or so?  Probably the cheapest I've ever paid for this dish, and one of the largest portions.  Also, they aren't afraid to make it hot!  This 10/10 Thai Spicy was very close to accurate in my book!  To me, this is probably the best bang for your buck Thai I've ran into so far.  The portions are fair, prices are cheap, and the to-go order was ready right on the dot, so grabbing for a speedy lunch is a safe bet!    Glad I don't work down the street lol",

The only other Thai restaurant within close proximity is Nattaya's and this one to me beats her out.  We're presented with good Thai food at a lower cost than the one across the street.  Compared to all three locations this one is the nicest with the most upgrade in furniture.   My favorites are still the specials on the board, especially the salmon that I first tried on Spring Mountain.  I've had the Roasted Duck Fried Rice, Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, Roasted Duck Curry, and if they had a Roasted Duck Ice Cream I'd probably be all over that.  But I like eating in rather than taking out or having them delivered because I like to use the spice, sauce, vinegar that's delivered to your table.  The food is greasy but so good, I've also had the Chicken Satays that comes with the peanut butter sauce which was good and I like to judge a place by their Chicken Satay and sauce.",

I think this place is pretty new, because I haven't noticed it until recently.  Excellent food quality & prices.  The service is fast & friendly.  The location is very small, but extremely clean and very pretty inside.  Most of the soups are $6.50 - 7.    I tried the pork & fish ball soup because of another yelper's recommendation, and I was not disappointed!  I love that they offer 4 different choices of noodles, as I opted for the flat rice noodle.  Other noodle choices include: egg, vermicilli, or thin rice noodle.  Be careful with the little spice rack they bring out, as a little spice goes a long way.  Without meaning to, I overspiced my soup a bit, but it was still wonderful.  I just ended up drinking a lot of water and nursing my runny nose while enjoying my soup.  On my next visit, which will be very soon, I plan to try the Tom Yum soup.  Honestly, everything on the menu sounds great, which offers a full array of Thai dishes in addition to the soup.  They do take out orders, but I'm not sure if they offer delivery.",

    "text": "We liked it. It definitely does not deserve a 4 or more, though.  The inside is nice, clean, and modern. We weren't expecting that, especially after we saw the prices. Dishes were mainly around $7.95-8.95, which we thought were more along the lines of fast food prices. The portions, however, were remarkably small. You get what you pay for I guess.  We started off with a papaya salad, at a spicy 8/10. For some reason the portion we got was very very little, compared to some yelp pictures I checked online. Even the cabbage was just a small hunk, but when I asked for more, they were very accommodating.  We got some sort of veggie stir fry flat noodle, which was good, but could've been better. The vegetables in it weren't great, the carrots were sliced too thin, and the portion was again, too small.  The last thing we got was our least favorite. It was a seafood pancake, which I expected to be kind of like the ones you get a Korean restaurants, so I was curious about the Thai version. It was seriously lacking in the seafood, way too much starch or whatever they mixed it with so as a result kind of bland, and FAR too oily. I don't rarely blot food with napkins, but I did so in this situation. Also not a fan of the bed of stir-fry bean sprouts it came on, I think raw would've been more authentic? Just my two cents.  All in all, we really wanted to like it, we kind of liked it, and we hope that in the future they give bigger portions. We both agreed we could've gotten a fourth dish, which shouldn't be the case with any restaurant to feel full unless it's tapas.",

    "text": "Last night, I saw Paolo D.'s \"check-in\" to Komol, and I suddenly had a ridiculously crazy craving for their Herbal salad.  If I was pregnant, I would have made my husband drive to Komol just to pick up a week's supply. Unfortunately, I am not pregnant and due to my crazy soccer mom schedule I can't drive their myself. (I barely have time to write this review!)   Anyways, I was still craving some Thai food so I settled for Thai Style Noodle House for lunch since it is minutes from my own.  I have been here twice, ordering take-out both times.  The restaurant itself is decorated really cute.  but take-out is just so much more convenient for me.  Some of my favorite items are Pad See-eu with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and the Panang with avocado and shrimp.  These dishes are full of flavor and the spice levels are just enough to clear my sinuses and make me sweat/ glisten.  My kids enjoy the chicken chow mein (i know, i know...that isn't Thai food).  There is a good amount of chicken and veggies that they will actually eat!  The items that I did not really care for were the Beef Stew noodle soup and the Chicken Larb.  They were flavorful, however it was just too salty for me to eat more than 2 bites. I chugged my Thai iced tea in seconds, and chased it with a gallon of water. In fact, just thinking about it is giving me a salt headache.  ** Note: some reviews state that there is no restroom. There is one around back.  It isn't inside the actual restaurant, but there is one.  It isn't the most convenient location, but there is no need to torture your bladder. **  The service is quick and friendly, the price is very affordable, and it is around the corner so I'll definitely be back.  (at least until Komol starts offering delivery!)",

However, if you just knew from the start you couldn't get delivery, it wouldn't be that big of a deal.   Onto the positive... I like how your orders are saved under your phone number. We get the standard, safe dishes like panang curry, pad see ew, tom yum soup. We've tried the basil chicken, drunken noodles, and papaya salad. Of those three, I would only order the drunken noodles again. There are much better basil chickens and papaya salads elsewhere.",

But the spring roll and wonton they give you is sad. Had to remind them about the soup because they brought our entrees first, by the time the soup came it was cold so it was a waste. I had high hopes for this place because its close by, but I think I will just drive to Pin Kaow next time.",

I randomly came across it online and saw that it was extremely close to my house so gave it a shot. I'm glad I did! I got food to go so can't review the dine in experience, though all the people I dealt with were very friendly. I got the green papaya salad which was delicious but VERY spicy. I usually get a 7 and did that here also. I'd say their 7 is most other places 10! I also got the panang avocado curry with shrimp. This was totally delicious and while still very spicy it was closer to what I  would consider a 7. (I am not a wuss when it comes to spice but my tummy was a'gurgling after this meal!) I will be going back for more soon now that I know it's in my neighborhood...but perhaps scaling back my spice number for once!",

I haven't had anything from there that I didn't like. I love the combo beef noodle soup and their bbq over rice entree as well as their green curry. I got tofu and the yellow curry with pumpkin and chicken for the boyfriend who is Arab and never had Thai food before and let's just say he couldn't stop raving about it that he had to go get more curry from them the next day :) The staff are very friendly as well, even tho we would always go there late at night. I love that their food is pretty authentic, having experience Chef McDang's (Thailand's only Celebrity Chef) cooking first hand during his demonstration in our school. I'd definitely go there every time I crave for Thai food and would recommend to others :)",

We started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef Salad was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef. For entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was awful.  We each only took 1 bite.  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed. The fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a soggy mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant. Service was good, but our salads didn't come out at the same time, then the entrees came within just a few minutes of getting the last salad.",

I've had most of the things on the menu and the only things I like are the soups, basil fried rice, sticky rice, and papaya salad. All of the entrees I've had were weird and not prepared anything like I've traditionally had, plus they give a huge amount of rice per entree and in the same container so the rice gets all soggy. For the price the soups are a good value but everything else isn't because I don't feel that it's edible. The meats are always a weird texture, almost like they used canned meat or something like in the garlic pepper chicken, ginger chicken, even the fried chicken which has rave reviews was a weird orange and also soggy. How do you serve soggy fried chicken?? I've had more entrees and also ones with beef which weren't to my liking. The only things I have liked didn't have meat in them or had tofu. I'll still come here for the soups and basil fried rice, but nothing else.  UPDATE: Gave this place another try and it was even worse than before. With all the options out there and much better customer service elsewhere I won't ever be coming back. Disgusted by the workers here....",

Half of the entree box was the entree [mostly vegetables, little meat (this is coming from a light meat eater)] and the other half was overloaded with rice.  On the other hand they had a sign regarding a minimum spend requirement to use a credit card, but they still allowed me to use my card without a fee (at least I didn't see one snuck in there) which I appreciated. Hope others have a better food experience than I did.",

I just love walking in here.  SERVICE Better than other restaurants I've been to. Servers here are helpful and very fast. I'm always impressed because there are usually only 2 servers but they provide fast and great service to each and every single customers.  FOOD Their menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many choices! If you don't know what to order from here, I recommend: -Beef combination noodle (love the soup! you can choose the type of noodles. Egg noodle is my favorite) -Ginger snapper (LOTS of vegetables) -Orange chicken (always fresh and crispy!) Food is usually served within 10-15 mins.

The tables, chairs, yadda yadda are all pretty good. (Honestly? Asian places are best when they look kinda dirty.) But don't let that deceive that.  The food? Pretty darn good. I personally had a bowl of Tom Kha, otherwise known as Tom Yum with coconut milk. The chicken was of good quality, although the amount of mushrooms definitely left me wanting more. The broth had a great taste, and for the value, the dish was massive. However, that's also it's downfall. While the broth was rich and great, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Because of it's large amount, the broth by itself is a bit rancid and difficult to eat without any other ingredients, mostly because of its silky smooth texture.  My sister had the Appetizer sampler, complete with the great chicken kabobs, well made crab rangoons, typical egg rolls, and sadly disappointing fried tofu. It was too thin and dry to properly eat.  My favorite dish, however, were the flat Thai spice noodles. The beef had a succulent taste, and the fried noodles were delicious and melted in your mouth. It may have been one of the best thai dishes I had ever had -- even the amount of spice was perfect!  The value alone makes Thai Style Noodle House a must visit. While the rest of their Thai dishes are certainly great, I'll definitely be coming back for the namesake.",

The lunch special, which is about the same price as a full size entree, includes a gelatinous egg drop soup. Frankly, it was inedible. You have a choice of appetizer. Egg roll, fried wonton, or fried tofu. Never pick the fried tofu. It's disgusting. My entree was Spicy String Bean with Chicken, which was good, but tiny. It was literally smaller than the scoop of rice included.   Service is hit or miss; they never seem to answer the phone and they more than happy to make you wait half an hour to refill water or bring your check.. When the restaurant is empty.  If you must go here, get takeout of a full size entree, steering away from the chinese dishes. They are inedible. Try the noodle or curry dishes. The thai soups are also good (not the egg drop.)",

All I wanted was some acknowledgement that they did something wrong and should not be serving food like that. I still paid the full bill and tip $10 on a $30 tab as usall.

I prefer take out rather than dine-in from here, but all the noodle dishes are solid options (beef pad see eu and chicken pad thai being staples), as winter rolls out I'll be ordering heavily from the diverse soups offered. Service is polite, interior is surprisingly upscale if poorly maintained, and the pricing really can't be beat- especially for Summerlin!",

    "text": "LOVE this place! I just moved back to Vegas and I'm in search of a great Thai place. My husband and I stopped in last night (Saturday) at the recommendation of a coworker who lives in the area, and we really enjoyed the food - this is definitely a solid place for a good Thai dinner!  It's a cozy, welcoming place - very modern decor, with two different seating areas - we asked to be on the left side of the restaurant since nobody else was there, which they had no problem with. Someone came over quickly to get our drink order, and we put our dinner order in at the same time since we generally order the same thing every time we have Thai - chicken tom kha soup to share, chicken pad thai (me) and chicken thai fried rice (him) - all at a 6, or 7 if we really feel like punishing ourselves.   Our food came out quickly. Portions are a perfect size - there was enough tom kha for both of us to have a couple bowls and take home a serving for leftovers - husband finished all of his fried rice, but I had plenty of pad thai leftover. The food was delicious - very fresh and at the perfect spice level! Very flavorful. Their tom kha soup had more of a sweetness than we are used to, but it was so good - a welcome change.   At the end of our meal, someone else came around to check on us and make sure we liked our dinner and to ask if we needed anything. We didn't ever feel like we were waiting for service here, even as they started to get busier. Last thing to mention - prices are very reasonable. I think our bill was just over $20. I love this place and can't wait to come back!",

I miss that diner, it was good food.  It's not a huge place, but its very clean. There were about 4 tables occupied. One waitress, and one person in the back cooking I believe. I decided to go with the beef Pad See Ew (I can never spell this right). My friend chose noodle soup plus a thai meal she said she can never find here. Don't ask me the name LOL. Later she said it was just OK. My Pad See Ew was really good, sweet flavor on the noodle without that bitterness that sometimes accompanies this when the noodle is overfried.   I will come back, and I will try some other dishes. Easy, cheap cost, good food, good service. A winner in my book for what it is.",

I've been on a major Thai kick for a while so this place was right up my alley.   The decor you can tell is trying to be fancy, but the diamond buttons on the inside of the chairs are a bit much. I did like the trees painted on the walls with birds.   The service was swift and on point. They even offered me a to go cup for my Thai Iced Tea.   The Noodle House has excellent lunch specials! Which we totally took advantage of. You can choose from one or two items from their menu. On this visit I ordered the Red Curry with Pork. Joel had the Orange Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. Our meals came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The egg drop soup was really tasty. I had to stop myself from filling up on the soup it was so good. Plus, it didn't have that fake yellow color egg drop soup always has. My Red Curry was delicious. The pork was tender and the Curry itself had the perfect coconut milk flavor coupled with a great spice that wasn't overwhelming. The egg roll was crisp and full of veggies. Joel's Orange Chicken was also seriously tasty. It's normally not my thing, but it was so tender and not overly sweet. I kept sneaking bites of his chicken. Joel's Beef and Broccoli was also very tender and had great flavor.   I wish this place was on my side of town. The price was awesome, but the food was even better!! What a great find on a side of town I rarely visit!",

For the most part when I've been here the Pad Tai is great and the soups are good too. But a few times iv'e gotten Pad Tai where the meat tasted as if it, as I said was not cooked enough or had started going bad or old. I got shrimp Pad Tai once, tasted very fishy. So I thought i'll just stay away from the shrimp, then one of the chicken Pad Tai's I got tasted the same way.. little old or uncooked. So I probably will stay away from here for some time and hopefully it gets better when I come back or try again.  Also the service is.. nice but casual.",

Vegetarian egg-rolls (4 pcs) $4.95  Taste: 3 stars - Our takeout pad thai was on the dry side - we prefer our noodles moist and juicy! On the other hand, our pad see ew was cooked very well, the noodles were moist and the beef was tender. Yet, both noodle dishes were lacking much salt and sweetness. We were expecting bold, vibrant, Thai flavors, but instead the flavors of the noodle dishes fell flat. I favored the moist pad see ew over the dry pad thai. The veggie eggrolls were crispy, but sadly not stuffed to the max with veggies. However, their homemade sweet and sour sauce was amazing! I would order extra sauce next time.   Value: 5 stars - Wow! 2 dinner portions and an appetizer was $20! They were generous, even on takeout orders. They didn't skimp on any of the noodle dishes, lot's of meat and lots of noodles. It's hard to find decent local food on a bargain budget, but here it is!   Service: 5 stars - The lady was very friendly over the phone and she also gathered up thai bird chilies in fish sauce and jalapenos in vinegar for us, as we requested. Even though we were the last customers in the door for the evening, she was still happy and helpful.   Spice levels: 2 stars - Not very spicy. The spicy levels here are not True to taste. We ordered the pad see ew with spicy #7. In all honesty, we both felt that it was not a True 7, and more like a spicy #2. It wasn't spicy at all. We could of easily asked for a spicy 10 and enjoyed it. We also tried the pad thai with spicy #8, yes, it had minor heat, but more like a spicy #5. It wasn't spicy enough for us. (Note, we are avid spice fans. We love the burn!)  Would we eat here again? Oh hell yus!! Nothing a little salt can't fix.",

My boyfriend and I like it spicy (heh) so we got levels 5 and 7, respectively. The spice didn't overtake the flavor and I love me some coconut.  Not too oily, good quality ingredients. Quick service (we called ahead for take out). Would like to return and dine-in perhaps, storefront was cute with a few diners enjoying their own meals.",

For their lunch special, I ordered the panang curry with an egg roll and egg drop soup for under $6.  The egg drop soup was decent - it lacked a little flavor. The panang curry was delicious and I was able to taste the coconut milk with a little spice, but had more of a watery texture. I'm more of a fan of a thicker soup base with a lot more spice when it comes to curry, but they do give you the red chili flakes to add as needed.   Overall, I like this place especially the price! I will be back!",

When I saw that they have Tom Yum seafood noodle, I was intrigued since I haven't had it with noodles and seafood other than shrimp before.   They have an option of four different noodles. I chose the flat, wide rice noodles. The broth was so satisfying and flavorful. I went with spice level 5 which turned out to be just the right spice level. I loved it with the noodles, fish cakes, squid, etc. After I finished my soup, I already knew I would be back for this delicious, hearty, satisfying soup.",

We've been coming here for 3-4 years and the customer service has always sucked but the last couple visits have just been extra horrible. It's not even just this instance, it's just kind of the last straw because of how ridiculous it is?  It's honestly disappointing to see that repeat customers will always be treated worse with each occurring visit :)  edit: we have frequented this place much more then my check ins would lead you to believe.  There was a period of time that we went every other day. That's honestly why this is so upsetting. Supporting a local business is good and all, but not when they run their business like this.  Good job saving that 2cents on the packet of soy sauce (we just wanted one or two lol) And thanks for giving us the sweet and sour sauce spilled all over the bottom of the bag. That was very mature of you :)",

Apparently they want to charge you for a crispy pork but give you no pork and just the broccoli and rice with sauce for $8.50 when the steamed broccoli is $3.50?? So just so you understand the sauce costs more than the vegetable itself.. I don't want rice broccoli and sauce; simply wanted a side of veggie tossed in a sauce that's its, but that's not possible said the \"chef\".",

Most other things I've tried are decent but not amazing like the pad seeu is better sometimes than others because at times it has a bitter after taste even when it tastes good at first.
