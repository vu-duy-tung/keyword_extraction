Generous portions, fresh bread!! Their soup is addictive. The gyros huge!  Unfortunately this place to too far from me and we do not get there often enough.  I have not tried the dinner menu yet.

The place is never crowded or noisy so it's a great place to just enjoy each other's company. We aren't very adventurous, so I've only had the Gyro plate, but it's delicious. I usually get it with their lemon chicken soup which is great. The lemon flavor may be too strong for some, but it's perfect for me. I get French fries as my side on the plate, which are decent. The portion sizes are large so you shouldn't leave hungry!",

I've been coming here before the expansion just for the gyros alone and they never ever disappoint.  Make it a combo with either pilaf rice or french fries and a drink for like 2-3bucks more.    Just across the street is The Greek American Grille, but their fries and rice does not even compare to The Fat Greek. Not to mention TFG is more of a restaurant while GAG is more of fast food type.  I let my ex do all the ordering because I'm a man.. of my words lol  Chicken soulvaki.  Chicken skewers with a tzatziki sauce on side with a bed of pilaf rice.  Spanakopita spinach:  Nice flaky pastry filled spinach and a hint of butter or even cream. Definet Yes!  Babagounash:  Holy mother 'effer.  This eggplant dip was amazing and severed with warm pita bread.    Greek burger:  Never in my life and of all place would I thought the burger here be this good.  It was my ex's meal and yet i ate most of it.  A little too much bread for my liking, but the light thin cheese sauce, tirokafteri, was out of this world. Chopped red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a side of slice dill pickle to top if off. Winner!  Every time I dine here or pick up I received friendly service.  The place is always clean because the white and blue really stood out.  The week before I came here with a friend and had the Combination Plate For Two which is a variation of dish to try: (description from their website because i'd still no clue which is which) Moussaka - Casserole of Roasted Eggplants, Potatoes, and Ground Beef Baked with Greek Bechamel Sauce and Kefalotiri Cheese. Good stuff Pasticcio - Traditional Greek Baked Pasta with Rich Meat Sauce and Greek Bechamel with Kefalotiri Cheese. Like a lasagna with a layer of cheese. Gyro - Shaved lambs. Perfect as usual. Dolmades - Grape Leaves Stuffed with Seasoned Ground Beef and Herbs.  Ehhh something about eating the grape leaves.  It's not bad, but i can do without. Also come with roasted potatoes, pita breads, and soup or salad.  For 30bucks you can try different items, but if i had a chance to pick again i would have picked something else.  Its good, but right now carbs are my enemies.  Love this place!",

    "text": "Decided to drop in here with my mom while she was in town and really enjoyed our meal. We went for lunch and ordered a couple of gyros. I had the Chicken Shawerma and it was awesome! I have never been the biggest fan of Greek food, but it has grown on me recently. This place helped! One of the best gyros I have had and pretty fair priced for the size at $7.50. You must order the baklava! Get it as fresh as possible if you can, not sure what times they make it but I believe they only make certain number in the morning and then more later in the day. We were lucky enough to get it very fresh and it was fantastic. I have since stopped in and ordered two pieces to go and they seemed not as fresh and a bit tougher, but still tasted great. It's pricey at about $5 for a small 4x4 (maybe) square, but considering all the time and effort that goes in to making baklava its worth splurging on here and there. Only downfall for me is that they have separate menus for lunch and dinner. The gyros are only available on the lunch menu which I miss because I get out of work at 6pm. Maybe one day they will change that!",

My  best friend and partner-in-dining out, Ana, raved about eating here, and I thought to finally go out with her and give this place a try; I didn't expect much, but I did trust my friends' assessment--I am definitely glad I did! The restaurant is tucked away in an urban shopping center, without any special banner or advertisement. I almost didn't find it, driving past it. The interior is very average Greek-restaurant--light blue and white--colors of the Greek flag are decorated inside. I will say that the place was extremely clean and meticulous, which I appreciated. The food pleasantly surprised me. My Greek salad was very flavorful. Pita bread was average. Babaghanoush was as good as it gets. Chicken shawarma was slightly above average--but very fresh. Deserts were too die for--great prices, too! I had Napolean--huge portion for only $3. Incredible.   I have some food allergies, and both, the waiter and the chef came out to discuss which foods had certain allergies etc. Very much appreciated!  Service was good, although it did take a little bit to get the check. Overall, very well above average experience. I will be back. No, I plan to come back within the next two months and I'll update my review then.   Thank you, Ana, for introducing me to this authentic gem.",

They offer many  authentic Greek and other Mediterranean dishes and drinks,  the service is very good and hospitable, they really make you feel like home, we really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere here. Nothing says more Greek like blue and white colors, and this is what  you find here and at any Greek restaurant, blue and white and that's my description of the decor. Prices are reasonable and the food was excellent and authentic.. I know what you're thinking. how can a Mexican know anything about the authenticity of Greek food? Well if Zorba the Greek was actually a Mexican actor playing an authentic Greek character on the big screen, then I can pretty much play a Greek food connoisseur and tell you that the food I'm eating is authentic Greek food. Besides after a good moussaka a couple of mythos beers and a shot of raki  I even speak Greek ..... Opa! Opa!       ( means I need a cab.)",

The fries with melted feta on them are outstanding! We'll definitely be going back when we're in the neighborhood.",

We also got the hummus with pita for an appetizer. All the food was delicious. All the portions were huge. By the time I was halfway with my gyro, I was already super stuffed.   The place is really nice and set up and the staff is great with customer service. I would totally come back again.   My only complaint is that the hummus with pita didn't come with too much pita but it came with a lot of hummus.",

We went in and there was a mix up on our order, not a problem they fixed it and we're super apologetic about it.  My hubby ordered the beef shawerma combo. Its was perfect. Soft fluffy pita, tender beef. Fresh, fresh, fresh! Fries super crispy. I had the Fat Greek Salad. It was big. It was good....I WANT another...lol  I added chicken to it for an additonal charge of 3 bucks. I would happily pay that all day. The chicken is seasoned amazingly and charbroiled. I've never had a salad that didn't need some kind of dressing. This one does not. Between the red onions, feta and that chicken this salad packs a flavorful punch. I can't believe we waited so long to try this place. Will definitely be repeat customers.",

Party in your mouth...   The side salad with feta cheese... The feta is so good, smooth with just the right amount of sharp and saltyness, it's creamy yet light... With really fresh olive oil and vinegar, never thought I would enjoy side salad add much as I would enjoy the main dish  Falafel was really really fresh, you can taste all the peas grinded into it and not crushed.  It is formed into a perfect serving size and fried just right, accompanied with greens and overall again the perfect balance  Definitely would come back and visit every time I'm in Vegas  The only reason I have it a for instead of five is due to wait time, servers are knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.  The kitchen had lost my ticket, and my server explained what had happened and offered that kitchen is putting my orders in priority",

We arrived about 30 minutes after placing the order with EAT24. We were then told to wait 10-15 minutes. It was another 30 minutes. Not only were they late with horrible service, THEY FORGOT THE CHICKEN on the salad which was an extra $3.   The entire restaurant was angry. One man and his wife had to get up from their seats to get drink refills. The table next to us didn't even have their orders put in for the 30 minutes we were there.  The food itself was below average. The greek salad wasn't bad but my falafel sandwich was awful (I am middle eastern and know good falafels when I eat them).   Don't waste your time with this place. I am shocked they have 4.5 stars. Awful.",

Usually when I go to Greek restaurants I expect to see menus full of pictures and exclamations of what the foods are. This was a very simple menu so checking yelp is the best way to determine what I wanted.I am quite a visual person so I wanted to see what the Greek salad would look like before I ordered it but it was not on the menu as a photo just as an explanation. So I will let you know that it was delicious and absolutely worth it. One of my favorite Greek salads is from New York City is Taim. and I always hold that in comparison to the standards.",

    "text": "I work super close to this restaurant and love Greek food! I have ordered to go and eaten inside several times. However I always have the WORST service EVERTIME I go! There's this older lady there that usually helps me and she is not friendly and very rude! She argues with me about the stupidest things every time! For instance, I ordered a Greek gyro salad and a side of baba Ganoush . Baba Ganoush  is an appetizer so it comes with pita bread. They also give pita bread for the salad every time I order it. When I went to pick up my order I pointed out that I was short on pita bread. They only gave me 1 that was cut in 4's. She spent 10 minutes arguing with me until finally the cook came over and gave me the extra pita bread I was supposed to get in the first place!  Also- last week my co workers and I called and placed an order for pick up. We usually pay separately with our cards so we have to order each of our orders separately. They told us 1 time before that they cant put it on more than one card (which sounds like BS to me) but whatever we just order each separately. But we were so frustrated because we sent one of our co workers to pick up the food and when she arrived, there was a line out the door of people waiting to pick up their to go order. She spent about 45 mins in line and when she got to the front they told her the credit card machine has been broken all day and we had to pay with cash only! It was super frustrating because they didn't warn us on the phone. So our co-worker had to take her personal debit card into the grocery store next door and pull out enough cash to pay for everyone's order. After she did that, they handed her the order rudely and they didn't even apologize. When she brought the food back to the office it was super cold! We all had to then go and get cash to pay her back. It would have been nice for them to warn us! Like I said, the customer service sucks every time we go here! We have decided to stop ordering here because of all these problems!",

The Falafal Plate comes with a side of a cucumber salad so be prepared and don't order too much (we did but we don't mind leftovers).

I'm used it it being a little more chunky, but the taste was right on.  We also split a gyro dinner.  Glad we did the split because it was Lumber Jack sized.

I have tried to give these people chances multiple times because they are close to my office, but they can't get it together. Because the service is exceptionally slow during lunch my coworkers and I usually order for pick up. Apparently they can't handle that.  Here's a rundown of the many things they have done to earn this review: 1. They flipped out because we asked for two separate checks for a phone order and refused to accept split payments. I had to pay for a coworker's meal as a result. 2. They have messed up phone orders more than once; forgetting gyro meat on a gyro salad and a side order with a plate. They were not willing to refund the meals in either case, nor did they apologize. They actually argued that a mistake was made in the first place. 3. They have left me on hold and eventually hung up altogether when I've tried to place phone orders. Additionally the staff has poor attitudes and always seem unhappy to be there. As I said before, the food is fine (assuming your order is right) but they are clueless about running a business.",

    "text": "Excellent food, excellent service, cheerful atmosphere, and great prices. They offer a number of traditional Greek dishes that are rarely found in Greek restaurants in the US. Everything is fresh, well prepared, and nicely presented. I had the meat-stuffed grape leaves in lemon sauce. Delicious! And obviously freshly prepared, not frozen. It came with a large, crisp, fresh salad. (One has a choice of soup or salad with all the entrees.) My companion had the \"village salad\", which is a traditional Greek salad as they are served in Greece, (meaning without lettuce) with grilled chicken on the side. It was huge, fresh, well seasoned, & dressed with real olive oil. The meal came with a nice basket of warm crusty bread and sliced pita pockets, with a generous slab of fresh butter on the side. We both had their Armenian coffee, which is excellent. Sugar and milk not required! (But it comes with both, should you want them.) We had walnut cookies for desert, crisp and buttery. The service is excellent, friendly and attentive. When I forgot my jacket, the waiter found me in the supermarket next door to return it! All this, and a soda was only $33! The only thing missing from the menu would be an authentic Greek frappe, but this is a minor detail. The decor is cheery and bright, and everything is very clean. This restaurant is well worth the short drive off the Vegas strip. Highly recommended, especially for anyone who is homesick for authentic Greek cooking!!!",

    "text": "My friends couldn't decide what to eat, so I eliminated choices and we ended up here at the Fat Greek because the Greek food makes the tummy happy and not overall full.  The restaurant is rather clean as well as the bathrooms which some of the others on these reviews had mentioned.  Why this is four stars, and it's because I didn't get to try all their yummy food!  I hope to come back to Vegas and try the rest of the items on the menu.  So many unique items I have never even heard of:  Tirokefteri (I don't even remember what this was but I know it was really good and spicy) Saganaki (Salty kinda crispy cheese)? Tzatziki (yogurt with cucumber with infused olive oil) --common at most Greek Restaurants (this was a little different from other Greek Restaurants I've been to, but it was so refreshing) Babaganoush (eggplant) -- common at most Greek Restaurants  Avgolemono-Lemon, rice, chicken soup-- I am a soup fan, so I loved this soup, however, I wished it was a little more lemony to add extra zest.  Fat Greek Gyro with Chicken/Lamb-- Chicken was on the dry side but still delicious.  I don't believe in ever restaurant being perfect, but we came at a not busy time and there was only one waiter, and he did an okay job checking up on us.    Take Home Message: If you want a break from the strip, come to Fat Greek to have some happy tummy food for lunch.",

I was really hungry so I just dealt with it So when I order my food I told her no sauce im allergic to It I made sure she heard me.Another ten minutes go by still no food I only got one gyro and another 15 minutes goes by nothing the waitress did not even check up on me.I notice the cooks where working real slow in the kitchen a lot of people  wore waiting for food too I asked to speak to the manager he actually blame me he said I should know its busy and the food will come when its comes.I was very upset then the food did arrived the manger said see there is your food what are you complaining about.So when I look at it they put the sauce on it really after waiting all this time I could not eat it I tried to get the waitress but she refuse to come to the table.I had to get up to the front and that is where the manger was,he said what is your problem now.I was in disbelieve I told him I was allergic to the sauce he said I was lying well i only had water and ate no food so i walk out As you know part of running a business is not only about the food it is having a good staff and cooks that do their job well because if you know you get that busy and there other reviews about the wait time being to long you would try to fix that problem not make it worse",

Truthfully, I went there because it was the closest Greek restaurant to where I was staying with good reviews.  As others have said, it is super clean, and the service is great.  But, the food?  It is hands down, the best Greek food I've ever had.  I ordered humus and flat bread, the fried cheese - not sure what they call it because I'm not Green and cannot pronounce most of the menu items.  And I also had a Gyro plate with Greek Salad.  Eating each course, bite by bite, I felt as though the room filled with helium and I was floating off to somewhere over the Mediterranean Sea.  side note, I have tattoos all over my neck and head so I sometimes get treated like a criminal or at the very least skeptically.  But, the staff was polite and very on the ball.  When I was about to take my last sip of soda, the waitress appeared with a pitcher and refilled my glass.  She thought I ordered alot of food and would have left overs buy I did not.  I would have kept eating until I popped.",

    "text": "Food was probably 3.5 stars but customer service sucks. Also, as someone already stated, not many vegetarian options except falafel plate, lentil soup and salads. Would have liked more of a selection for vegetarian plates.   Didn't like their charging policy and poor customer service.  Just note they have a 20 % compulsory gratuity if you have a party of 11- even with separate checks. And, they charge you 1.00 for more sauce (when the falafel comes with the sauce and should have more i.e. they're skimping on the sauce.) normally, sauce is included in Greek places in a plastic squeeze bottle - especially at the prices they are charging for food and if the item you ordered should have come with sauce and more of it!!  I could understand if the food that I ordered didn't have the sauce as part of it.  I ordered the falafel plate and I specifically asked them not to make the falafels dry. I asked them to put more water/ not to use too much oil/ whatever could make the falafels more moist (hate dry falafels) but instead of thinking to offer me more tahini sauce, they skimp on it and on top of that, they charge me 1.00 for more sauce they should have included with the falafel plate in the first place!!    When I got my falafel plate, there was barely any tahini sauce. I asked him for the same sauce as what was in the falafel and he gave me a white sauce (which I guess was thazini sauce.) he came out with the tahini (brown sauce) when I mentioned it was the sauce I didn't want. I wanted the same sauce that was in the falafel sandwich. He came out with the correct sauce. But, both times,  he never mentioned that the sauce was 1.00/ sauce when I didn't even want the first sauce he gave me. When I got the bill, I was obviously upset. Instead of trying to make it right, he said \"the sauce charge was m in the menu\" thereby justifying why he didn't have to tell me there was a charge when I ordered it.  I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager wasn't there. Wasn't the least bit apologetic nor trying to rectify the problem but just left!!  I told him I would pay for one but not the one I didn't want. He finally conceded but not happily. Customer service sucks!!  I do like that they cut up the falafels into strips so the falafels don't seem as dry since they are not such hugh balls of dryness...",

It was more than $75 for four people.  I ordered 4 Original sandwiches, one with the sauce on the side. Four fries, and three extra sauces, with three Cokes and a Raspberry Ice Tea. What I got: sandwiches were right, fries were right. I got sauce on the side for one, none of the extras I paid $8 for.   I got three flat diet Cokes and one regular tea with no ice. Another $8, add the tip portion for that and I'm out twenty bucks already. So I called the place. The first guy started explaining why the order was late when I didn't even bring that up, although it was.  Enter second guy who says yeah they forgot the sauces.  @__@. So he asks if I order there a lot, I said it's our first time. He says yeah but you live in Vegas right? I admitted I did. He says mention it next time and they'll give me the sauces. Really? Wow, I get to eat dry sandwiches and be blackmailed into eating there again?  He said since it was Grub Hub it's just more work for him to fix it.  He also said they knew they were out of the tea I ordered but just gave me what they had.  Guess they are out if ice, too?  The sandwiches were good, maybe if you're eating in it's ok. You know because you'll be able to get what you paid for. Unless you want fresh drinks too.",

It was very close to my hotel and easy to navigate to since it was in the opposite direction of the Strip. The hummus was excellent - some of the best I've had in a while; creamy, smooth and had a nice flavor. I ordered the chicken pita, and although it was a little larger than I would like, the chicken was well marinated, very flavorful and juicy. Everything inside - including the tzatziki. I was extremely happy with my choice and would definitely return. The restaurant also seemed to cater to a strong local clientele.

I work in fine dining, I'm picky, demanding and hold people to a very high standard! The response to the mistake was not only above and beyond my exspectations, but the food was also above and beyond my exspectations !  Light airy phyllo dough Spanicopida ( spinach cheese filled crossant style Greek pastry)  AMAZING GYROS! Real carved meat! Big portions! Fresh SALADS with quality ingredients, big fresh feta chunks and kalamata olives!  LOVED IT ALL! REMINDS ME OF MY PAPOO's GREEK RESTERAUNT IN CHICAGO!   I will order again!!! See the pics!!!!",

    "text": "I would really rate this place a 4 1/2, but you have to choose and it's hot and sweaty today, so I'm going with the cranky option.   Speaking of cranky, one of my quarrels is that you never know what kind of mood the waiter will be in. Never actually rude, but sometimes pleasant and sometimes looking like he was wishin' he was someplace else. We all feel that way, buddy, but you are working for tips and you need to be kissin  butt the like the girls do.   Having said that, I have mostly praise for the food. They have, hands down, the best tzaziki dip I've ever had. It's creamy, tangy, and enhanced with just a little kick of ouzo. Mmmm! (Maybe the fact that they were out today is what's pushing my cranky button. That and the fact that they could break loose with a little more pita to accompany it. Don't be cheap, especially with bread)!   They also have actual Greek salad; by that I mean NO LETTUCE! Yes! They also have the option with lettuce, if you don't know any better, but today they served it without  the dressing. Not docking them because it wouldn't have hurt the wounded parties to just ask for some, but still!   Gyros are tasty and filling, the chicken and rice is enough for two meals, and the fries, both regular and Athenian, are always hot, fresh and crispy. (As in burn your tongue). Baklava is stuffed with nuts and plenty to share, but don't try to get any of mine!   My only real quarrel is the saganaki. This classic dish of flaming cheese needs to be flaming. What a disappointment to get a slab of it just breaded and fried. (OK, I know that sounds good, too, but you'll have to trust me on this.) Still, I highly recommend this place. Just put a torch to that cheese and I'll give you that other star.",

Fries were crispy outside and still fluffy inside. He originally wanted to get falafel but they were out, so next time.  I got the chicken shawarma w/ Greek salad. The chicken was pretty juicy and the hummus in it was good and plentiful in meat and toppings. Salad was pretty basic, but very fresh and crisp.   We got a baklava to share since it just got out the oven. This would have been pretty good of a pastry but the nuts tasted a little bit burnt so it was toasted a bit longer than it should have been.   Service was friendly, but a bit slow. This though wasn't because the server wasn't doing his thing, but he was the only server with two big parties and 3 other tables. There were other people prepping and who I think is maybe an owner sitting around, but no one helped him out.   Overall a pretty decent lunch spot.",

So glad we did.  We ended up going on a Sunday for dinner/supper.   Since we did our research prior to going we knew they offered a gyro and fries.  But when we were given the menu it wasn't there.  Mentioned this to the waitress,which she said wasn't a problem and allowed us to order a lunch menu item for dinner. The gyro was wonderful!  Fries too.   Eventhouh we were already stuffed, we somehow managed to order the baklava.  It was equally as good.  I don't know what type of honey they have but I could drink it straight!

The Fat Greek is one of them, a delightful and unassuming Greek restaurant conveniently hidden in a strip mall next to a Smith's grocery store.  The inside is airy and inviting, the staff was attentive during my two visits here, and the Greek food is as good as you'll find in the Las Vegas area.  Nothing fancy, just straightforward Greek classics and moderate prices.  If you're somewhat new to Greek food, try the sampler plate for two.  It has all of the best dishes and comes with soup or a giant Greek dinner salad.  The appetizers are solid as well, especially their felafel and tzatziki - as good as I have had in Greece, whether in the islands, in Athens, or in the northern region like Kastraki.  I saw other reviews saying that the food was average, while also stating it was the reviewer's first time eating Greek food.  If you're looking for powerful flavors that BLOW you away, then Mediterranean food is not for you - stop bashing a cuisine because you're used to over salted and over spiced meals.  The classic Gyro plate is solid, the meat a great blend of lamb and beef with just enough spice.  It may be hard to truly screw up most Greek dishes, but this place delivers an especially good Greek meal from a value perspective as their prices are very reasonable.  This is my new go to Greek place when I am sentenced to Vegas on business.  If you like Greek food, you won't go wrong here.",

    "text": "We are staying on the strip and are so tired of overpriced junk food. I looked up Greek food on yelp and found this place. I was only a short drive from the strip that was well worth it. I ordered food to go, I got a Greek salad with grilled chicken, a chicken gyro with fries, and a piece of baklava. The food was still hot and delicious after I got back to our hotel. The salad was so fresh and the chicken well seasoned. The chicken gyro had some of the most scrumptious feta I have ever had and it was topped with fresh tomatoes and lettuce. The baklava was out of this world! I definitely recommend this place to anyone staying near the strip who wants fresh and reasonably priced instead of bland and overpriced! The woman who helped me with my order was very courteous and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes. Eat here!",

    "text": "With a name like this, it took a while for me to get up the nerve to go: I'm not sure it's good marketing, but at least it indicates that the food is probably good. After visiting, I can confirm, it is the kind of food you can get fat on.  Location is easy to miss if you aren't familiar with the plaza- I've driven past the intersection countless times but didn't know it was here. Parking can be difficult to find due to other busy businesses nearby. This place rocks a giant but empty patio which would probably be better utilized as additional parking spaces.  Ordered a fat gyro and athens fries. The fat gyro is no joke, the name of this sandwich is as honest as the name of the restaurant: it's enormous and was two solid meals for me. The chewy, soft pita pilllowed a plentiful portion of moist and flavorful gyro meat, topped with tzatziki sauce and feta, and supplemented with lettuce and tomato. From the first bite to about the middle of the 'ro, it is amazing: flavors complement one another in a classic way that is key to a good gyro. Then you realize how full you are and the debate between having fries and saving the other half, or forcing yourself to finish, kicks in. I opted to resis the urge, but was underwhelmed by the fries: I went at an odd time between lunch and dinner and expected the fries to be made fresh but they tasted like they'd been sitting out a while and were a bizarre combination of dry and flavorless. That being said, the cheese atop them was a generous amount, and the portion was a good value for the $3 price tag. However, I'm just not cool with the idea that I need to add several shakes of salt to a heap of cheese and fries to make them palatable.   If you choose to stuff yourself with gyro instead of opting for a side, I won't judge you. But I will judge you if you follow that up with another meal later in the day because, Lord, that's a lot of food! If you opt to save it for later, as I did, consider taking the lettuce and tomato out so that you can heat it up without getting nasty warm produce when you reheat in your morning daze. Also consider removing the layer of foil beneath your leftover fries so as not to reenact the microwave-fire scene from American Hustle. Your intact kitchen and taste buds will thank you.",

It's also super close to where we live so we end up ordering take-out here at least once a week. We've actually never eaten inside, but its a cute place.  The food is always quality, delicious and the portions are great for the price.   Our favorites include their chicken or beef kabob plates, the Fat Greek gyro, the Athenian fries, and the Fat Greek salad with chicken (the chicken has a delicious lemon sauce on it). (We're creatures of habit) Although I'm sure everything is great. Their desserts are very good too.  The entrees come with soup or salad (we always opt for the salad, which is a small, fresh Greek salad) and also comes with pita.  We're moving at the end of the year and this will be my most missed Vegas restaurant!",

They were the best I've ever had. They weren't dry either. Our gyros were good too and they don't skimp on the hummus when you order it! Definitely my new go to spot for Greek food in Vegas!

Needless to say it took a good 40 minutes before our orders was served in full. My spouse's food was forgotten. Had to remind the server twice. They were nice and attentive though but because they were busy ad understaffed that they just couldn't fulfill.  Between spouse and I, we had the Greek Village salad with falafel, grilled chicken plate with rice pillaf and lemon chicken soup and fries with cheese on top.

I can say only that they were good, but not great. (Having just experienced the Las Vegas Greek Food Festival, I couldn't help comparing and I liked the Spanakopita and Tiropita I had there better). I also ordered the Babaganoush. It, also, was good, but not great. There was that slightly bitter aftertaste that I often detect in Babaganoush. So, while I would give this restaurant 5 stars for it's charming decor and attentive servers, the food earns only 3 stars from me. However, the decor may lure me back to try their Pasticcio(Greek lasagna). And THAT will either make it or break it!",

It will fill you up and I'm happy to say that the ratio of Tzatziki, Feta, and Veggies perfect for me. I don't find anything lacking.  So I ask myself, if the food is this good being delivered by a 3rd party what does it taste like fresh. I recently stopped in on my day off to answer that question. The food i so much better when you eat in and I am more inclined to order other things on the menu aside from something I think will carry well.  I had the Shrimp Santorini which is like a Mediterranean style Capellini with a Pomodoro Sauce tossed with ten Shrimp. It was great and enough for 2-3 people.  Also got to try the Fat Gyro made fresh and it made a huge difference.  I was really good delivered but excellent fresh which was expected.  Add some Hummus and extra Pita and my tummy was happy.   I will continue to order from here but will stop by whenever I get a chance.",

Very welcoming for a neighborhood restaurant. My favorite is the Avgamolo soup. It's egg and lemon in a chicken broth with chicken and rice. Prices are so good, I often stop to take out a small container for a quick lunch. Also try their deserts. Yummy!!!!! Check out the vintage cookie jar collection on the shelves behind the register and there is an open window to the cLEAN kitchen. I love that!!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place.  I came here straight from work with two friends for an early dinner at 6 pm. We chose to be seated outdoor as the weather was pleasant. Our servers quickly set up the table and took our drinks order. Good first impression certainly, but it was all downhill from then.  I was disappointed that they were out of bean soup, the only vegetarian soup on their menu (lentil soup, other vegetarian-sounding soup was made in chicken broth). I tried spankopita, which was very different from the one I had at Paymon's, but it was good nonetheless. We ordered saganaki, fried cheese for the table, but it was very disappointing. It was rubbery and too salty. In salads, they do side portion only for Greek salad. So I had to order full plate of Athenian pasta salad. The pasta salad was good, and so were their breads.  Among dishes my friends ordered, lamb shank was a winner. Keftedakia, not as much. They are famous for their ball shaped variety of cookies, but I guess we were out of luck that day. They only had walnut cookies and they were uninteresting and dry.  It seemed our servers had forgotten us after seating us outside. After waiting for 15 mins for the check, we literally had to wave at them for their attention.  Being spoilt for choice with so many Greek and Mediterranean restaurants in Vegas, I don't think I will come here again.",

I call in and normally, by the time I drive there I only have to wait ten minuets. Which isn't that long since we call in a bunch of food. Their food is fresh and has a delightful smell the whole way home. They have a different take on a dish that I like and it's great.  The restaurant isn't in the best of areas but is in an ideal location.  Outside, where the city wreaks havoc, it isn't very clean and you can smell the stench of bums, but when you go inside its a different story. The restaurant is clean and shows the traditional colors you see in Greek atmosphere, blue and white. As you walk in the direction of the cash register you will notice a long mirror extending the whole left wall and tv's showing the news or a game. The place seemed like a very relaxing place and if I didn't work out late then I would enjoy sitting down and eating. Normally when I come there is a lady there who is really nice and treats us well. All in all it's a good place to eat and the way they conduct business with their customers is excellent. I'll enjoy meandering over here for years to come :)   Keep up the good work you guys",

I came here and got a greek salad with gyro meat on top, which was suggested by the woman who took my order. I was originally going to order a Gyro Plate, but she realized I wanted more salad, so she said I should just do the salad with extra meat, which was a great recommendation. The lettuce on the salad was so nice! Very crispy and delicious. The meat also was really flavorful and satisfying. The salad came with Tatziki and Pita, which were both also delicious. The bread was grilled, but soft and really good!  The woman at the counter was friendly, helpful with suggestions, and just nice overall. I came when it wasn't at all crowded on a Saturday night and I think if I was in Vegas again, craving Middle Eastern food, I would come back here because it seemed pretty high quality and decently priced since it's farther away from the Strip. I also tried the baklava and it was pretty good, but I usually like the pastry to be a bit lighter, but it was still pretty tasty.",

I had just forgotten where it was because I used to live in a different area, but now I am really glad that I found it back!!! Food is delicious! My mom and I went there for dinner. They give you warm bread and pita bread with butter to start. Then we had the fat greek salad, which was healthy and tasty. Afterwards we shared the moussaka, which was really good, but be careful, portion size is gienormous!!!Even though we shared it, it was hard to finish it all and we were stuffed! We didn't have room for dessert this time, but Im sure next time I will try some! Great food and great service and staff!!",

They bring you out bread and the bread was so soft and fresh and was awesome with the hummus. Oh and cheap too! The plates came with a salad and rice or fries. I bad the rice and the Greek salad. And I lived the taste and of the salad. Everything was super fresh. The lamb and beef were both juicy and so good. The pilaf (rice) had an amazing flavor to it too! Our tab was only 35 dollars, which was awesome for the amount of food. Service was great and fast. Definitely had a wide selection of options but I would definitely say to try the gyro plate!   Highly recommend it if your in the mood for Mediterranean food!",

    "text": "Sounds like Sanchan below and I had the same experience.   Walked in at 5:30 on a Monday and the restaurant had two families dining there already. My cousin and I plopped ourselves down and settled on sharing an appetizer and a large entree plate (Kabob plate).   After being presented with menus, it took forever for the waiter to come around and take our order. Also, my water glass was downed within 5 minutes of seating and in the 75 minutes or so I was seated, it was never refilled. It seemed as if ONE guy were working. The restaurant eventually filled up by 6:30 but there was still ONE waiter working all the tables.   The appetizer (calamari) seemed to be kinda..old? It was crispy but didn't taste very fresh. My cousin and I felt as if it were bought and fried..and overcooked. Really not great.  The fries here are great, and the kabob plate was pretty tasty. However, the service once again got us all bent out of shape. We had to wave the ONE guy down but he was too busy trying to get people seated, orders, and whatnot.   I finally ended up just picking up my card and walking over to him at the cash register because we were starting to run late and I was tired of waving him down.   I wish I could love it because there are so many positive reviews here. I might try to give it another chance, but that's honestly a \"fat chance\" (pun intended).",

    "text": "One of the \"go-to\" Mediterranean joints around my work.  Am I the only one who confuses Mad Greek with Fat Greek though?  On any given day I have no idea which one is which and which one I prefer (I definitely prefer this one though).    The first time I went here I was convinced they had the best falafels I'd ever had (then I went to Hedary's a few days later and it got bumped to #2).   I noticed Misti in her review mentioned they seemed overcooked.   I actually have experienced them this way a few times from here but happen to enjoy the flavor that the falafels get with some extra cooking once in a while.   Would now be an appropriate time for me to present you with my idea for a restaurant that only serves burnt food?   Am I the only person who would eat there?   But I digress...  So yeah, love the falafels, and love the lentil soup as well.   I've also ordered the Chicken Skewers and thought those were excellent as well.   Big chunks of juicy chicken on a skewer with sliced tomato over some rice.  What more could you want?  Service is usually fine, but a few times one of the male staff has seemed a little stand-offish to me.  Prices are fair, but not any exceptional value either.    Bottom line is the Fat Greek is one of the better Mediterranean restaurants here in Las Vegas.   I just hope no-one ever opens a place called \"The Bad Greek\" anytime soon.",

My first visit here took almost an hour for the food to arrive, and that was with a warning from a friend who's also had a similar experience. That's the reason for the 3 stars. I got the Fat Greek Gyro with chicken. Everything was great, especially the tzatziki sauce. I also got a side of pita and hummus, both of which were good.  The interior is literally all baby blue and white. It makes me feel like I'm near a beach. There are many seats, so if you come in with a large group, they can probably accommodate.  I would recommend this place ONLY if you're off work or if you have nowhere that you'd have to be. Otherwise, you'll be having a 2 hour lunch break. However, they also seem to do pick-up orders; I saw people come in and walk out with a bag of food in under 5 minutes. That might be the best way to enjoy the food.",

    "text": "Surprised at how many nice reviews this place received. I don't usually write Yelp reviews unless I had a genuinely great or terrible experience... This place fell flat.    First off... $10 Gyro Sandwich??  Coming from a San Diego local's perspective, THAT is an absolutely ludicrous price. Best Gyro in USA too? Pretty cocky.   My friends and I stopped in after EDC weekend with a craving for some decent Greek food. Firstly, I wanted to order a slice of baklava with my meal but after checking the prices, one friend and I decided to just split the gyro price by itself. I was really bummed because I would have loved a sweet for my road trip... But if I remember correctly it was around $5-$6 alone? Come on.   I decided to grab a drink too and opted for Pepsi. I'm not sure if their soda machine was dirty or the Pepsi hadn't been changed out, but my drink had a horrible lingering aftertaste that made my stomach sick. Too bad I even paid for the drink, I ended up getting water instead:(   The gyro was so stupidly mediocre I couldn't believe we had even split the bill, much less paid for anything at all. The bread was tough and dry, the meat was bland, the veggies seemed out of season and the onions were vile. The sauce to accompany it was sour like a pickle. I'm not a professional by any means, but I've never tasted such a vinegary/pickled version of that sauce elsewhere. Needs SO much improvement.   The only good thing about the visit was very friendly employees working the registers, it seemed pretty clean, and also the restaurant was a bit cliche and awkward but all in all still charming. The seasoned fries were pretty yum too. I think I'll take my cravings elsewhere in Vegas next year.",

There's nothing fancy or trendy about this place, and I love it for that.   Easily some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Kebab platter, falafel, hummus, everything was top notch.

The Fat Greek is a great Greek restaurant in my neighborhood.  - Gyro plate - Lamb shish kebob  The lamb was tender and juicy, and the grilled vegetables came with aroma of charcoal.  Order comes with soup or salad, plus bread and butter in addition to pita. It's actually a lot of food at this point.  Also, they have the patio seating which is nice to chill out in the cool evening.",

The gyro meat was moist and delicious, the tsatsiki was fresh and tangy, with a hit of dill.  I wanted to try the mousaka, but they were out of it the day I stopped in. They have lunch specials, so if you want to just grab a gyro, falafel, etc you can. I'm glad I found this place, and highly recommend!",

I've had many a gyro, but the feta cheese on the top of the Fat Greek Gyro really sets this gyro apart from the rest.  If you are a feta fan, you also have to try the Athenian fries- melted feta on the top of crispy, delicious fries.  Oh, so very good!   The Fat Greek is also an excellent value.  The portions are huge and the overall atmosphere of the place is great.  I think I will be hard pressed to find a gyro that is as good as the one I had here today!",

    "text": "He may be fat, but he is a charmer. \"Charming\" is not a word I use regularly, but it is the perfect word for The Fat Greek. Regardless of the food, the bright blue interior here is the perfect respite from the blazing desert days of Vegas. Right down to the chairs, everything is perfectly coordinated in a blue and white color scheme that makes you feel like you are in a cooler climate.   The service is also charming. Everyone is personable and easy-going. You can see that there are regulars, as the staff takes time to check up on the happenings in their lives. It definitely has the \"I could be a regular here\" vibe. It's just so darn charming. I simply can't think of a better word!  The menu has a broad range of Mediterranean offerings, not exclusively Greek, but I would expect a fat Greek to eat a lot of things, right? I shared bean soup, a falafel pita wrap and a Greek salad with some gyro on top with the husband. The portions are generous. For example, the small Greek salad was enough to share given the other items we had ordered. I loved the bean soup, and the salad was fresh with a nice dressing. The falafel pita was beautiful and prepared in a way that made it easy to eat. My husband really liked it, but the falafel had too much parsley for my taste and seemed a little overcooked. I probably would not order the falafel again. However, the soup and salad were winners! Looking around, the kabob plates looked tempting, and it is probably worth exploring some of the authentic Greek options. I just couldn't resist trying the falafel!   Next time, I'm going for the appetizer combo plate.",

The first thing I knew I was getting was Athenian Fries. I'm not sure how \"Greek\" french fries really are, but hey, they have them on the menu, the gentleman at the counter recommended them AND the owners are really Greek, so why not. I'm a sucker for Feta Cheese so the Beef/Lamb Fat Greek Gyro sounded great to me. Neither selection let me down. The Gyro was HUGE!   The venue was very clean and the service was friendly and quick. Next time I would love to sit down and eat at the restaurant when I have time and eat only from the appetizers list. I heart Greek food, and especially love it when you know the restaurant owners are Truely Greek. :)  A great seletion for quality, fresh Greek food. Yum.",

I can't fathom the fact that Americans enjoy gyro bologna, which is thin and processed (not skewered) and worth about $0.01/lb. Gyro meat should be chunky, moist and crispy... and lamb OR beef.

It was already about 8:50pm when we got there, but they welcomed us in as if the place had just opened up for the day.    Our waitress was super friendly and suggested we get the four-appetizer combo when we couldn't decide which appetizer to get.  Along with the combo, we also got the calamari.  The babaganoush and the hummus were my favorites of the cold appetizers, and the calamari was light and crispy.  Not to mention, our waitress kept bringing us fresh oven-warm pita like a Mexican restaurant brings your a never-ending bowl of tortilla chips.  My pork chops were fantastic--a huge serving of pork chops that were juicy and flavorful.  And I loved the lemon roasted potatoes that came with the chops.

I will never come again I normally go twice a month service has always been slow but this is ridiculous.",

You have to self seat which actually makes me crazy but that's just one of my personal quirks.  It took longer than I think it should have to get our order taken but it was prime lunch time and the restaurant was quite crowded.  There were only 2 servers so that probably didn't help much.   It also took quite some time to get our food but again it was busy and I think there was only one person in the kitchen.   Once we did get our food I will say it was worth it.   The flavors are deep, rich and strong in a good way.   The only thing I didn't like was the pita bread as it was thin and hard.   Definitely well be coming back for more.",

    "text": "Last Monday, I ordered a classic gyro sandwich via Eat24. I liked the convenience that gave me especially when you can set up a schedule for your food to be ready. Having said that, they were quick in service. I walked into the restaurant, and my food was ready after transaction.  Ambiance: The interior of this shop was a bit rundown. It's a shame because it seems like they get a lot of customers, yet they don't seem to care for customer experience. It almost reminds me of a diner with old looking seats, tables and decor. It's not really something I want to see you while eating.   Food: The classic gyro seemed average in taste. The most notable part of this sandwich was the meat. I loved how tender it was as it made the meal enjoyable. Honestly, I could've eaten that on its own or maybe with salad. One setback about it was the over execution. With out together, nothing seemed to pop out except for the gyro. It was almost as though, I could do without the other ingredients.  Customer Service: I may have put this at a four star had the rep didn't make me feel so unwelcomed. I walked to the counter and he stared at me not asking what he can help me with. Instead he continued staring with a scowl on his face! It was unbearable and I almost wanted to ask what his problem was. Luckily, another server came up to me and asked what I needed. Anyway, that was one of the worst experience I've had in a long while! Maybe they need to train that man about being courteous or put him at the back with the cooks. He really didn't have a place to be up front looking so upset.",

Fresh food. For starters my go to is the chicken lemon rice soup(not sure how to say the actual name) then I get the skewers or kabob . Chicken and shrimp with veggies and rice. The beef  isn't really my preference it's usually pink unless you tell them otherwise. I like to come in the day and the portions are different . But in the evening the bread they serve is amaaaaazing ! I love it .  All of the waiters are cool . And the service is fast. I always suggest this place to  any of my friends coming into town.",

    "text": "Had a craving for gyro and thanks to Yelpers, found this place!  It's simple and clean, in a newly redone shopping center in a decent part of town. Plenty of parking. We came off hours, so it was almost empty, but had a steady stream of customers. Outside, the manager chatted with a couple of regulars. I like seeing that.   Service was fast and good. Both the gyros and kabobs were excellent. Quality meats, done perfectly. Will definitely be back! I think the ambiance would be nice at night, but even during the day, it's a go-to place for lunch.",

    "text": "Pay close attention to the low reviews that focus on service. This place has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.   I was craving some Greek food and the normal spot I go to is closed on Sundays. I checked Yelp and was convinced to try this place by the number of good reviews. I stopped in and was immediately a little weary because they didn't have much business. There were 3 tables in the restaurant. I went to the register and asked for a menu to place a takeout order. I noticed that the cashier was also the only waiter. After almost a 10 minute wait,  the guy came back and took my order. I got the traditional gyro with beef/lamb and an order of Athenian fries. I paid for my order by debit card and took the table closest to the register. During the 35 minutes it took for me to get my food I noticed the few people walking in not being greeted,  not knowing whether or not to just sit or wait to be seated,  and waiting for anyone to speak to them for 10 + minutes. Meanwhile the one waiter was lounging at the front chatting with the busboy.    Any remotely competent server could've handled this small size group with ease. Finally I asked about my food. Turns out my food was sitting on their back counter. I asked how long it was sitting there and the waiter said he didn't know. I opened my bag before leaving and the food was cold. Not having another hour to invest in this place since I paled in the 30 minute parking I just took it and left.   Don't come here if you're hungry, on any kind of schedule, or you want takeout. You will regret it. Soggy fries and dry gyro meat don't make me want to put up with this again.",

My favorite things to get are the lamb kabobs or the gyro place.  The lamb kabobs come with a delicious lemon sauce, veggies and rice.  Amazing!  Those two dishes also come with a side Greek salad.  A lot of food for a really good price.  Must try.    This place is located in an older strip mall, so dont let the location fool you.",

Everything looked yummy, so we were really crossing our fingers that it wasn't too good to be True.    We absolutely LOVED everything! The place was clean and decorated in white and blue which reminded us of Greece. Cute little spot in a strip mall.   Our server was nice and brought our food in it's respective time. There's nothing I dislike the most than bad timing. We ordered hummus; something I always look for: warm pita bread! They had it!! We had the time to enjoy it before getting our gyros as the main entree. Presentation was beautiful, clean and absolutely delicious.   We are definitely going back since we now found our GO TO Greek spot!",

My bf and I were regulars here (even though we would purposely call our orders in so it would be ready to pick up, yet we would always have to wait at least another 20 mins on top of the 20-30 we had already waited!) My order is simple, gyro plain! Kinda like when you order a hamburger plain, it's pretty self explanatory!  However they managed to mess this up almost every time! (Only reason I kept returning was bc they are close to my place!) So when I called to place my order and make sure I had my credit from the last time they screwed up my order, the OWNER basically told me I'm the problem bc I'm not placing my order correctly and I should probably just stop coming there!!!! Last time I checked when you order something PLAIN that means you don't make it with everything it normally comes with! I'm shocked at how rude the owner was! Worst customer service I have ever experienced in a restaurant!",

I ordered the pastichio with a side Greek salad and a rum raisin rice pudding. Every bite of the salad was delicious, the vegetables were crisp and ripe, the feta cheese soft and not too salty. The pastichio was unbelievable! The meat was so seasoned deliciously, and the red tomato sauce complimented it nicely. Finally, I had the rum raisin rice pudding and it made me smiiiile. So delicious. I'm so happy I didn't eat anywhere else today, this food def made my day. Wish they were open for breakfast lol.",

    "text": "Okay, so I have frequented at least 4 different Greek places in Vegas and have yet to find one I REALLY liked. I generally judge a Greek Restaurant on two things. First is their dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) and the second is their tzatziki (the cucumber yogurt sauce you usually get on gyros). This place delivered on both!   I actually ended up ordering an appetizer sampler (as I don't eat meat, the appetizers are where the good stuff is). I ordered the dolmades, hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki, which came with pita (although not enough pita to eat everything. I had to order more). For the most part everything was DELICIOUS!! The hummus did need a little more lemon juice for my taste, but that was an easy fix as they serve the platter with a wedge of lemon. The dolamdes were served cold, which I found I tend to like better. They had really good flavor and were a decent size. The baba ghanoush had a good smoky eggplant flavor and the tzatziki...OH, the tzatziki....it was so thick, creamy, and smooth (I mean, despite the fact that there were bits of cucumber in it - you know what I mean). GREAT flavor...a hint of dill, refreshing cucumber, a the distinct flavor of garlic (not overpowering, just a hint). It really is some of the best tzatziki I've had...even at \"authentic\" Greek places.  My bf got a gyro platter and he thought it was really good as well. It came with a side of fries which were REALLY good. They were a thicker cut fry with a crispy outside and velvety soft center. I really didn't know potatoes could have such a light texture. They were also coated in a kind of seasoning, although not overpowering. It may just be the oil they fried them in. TIP: Dip the fries in the tzatziki....oh so, so good.  The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't have a vegetarian platter. Yes, they have a falafel platter and a Spanakopita platter, but not a platter with the stuff I got on it. While I enjoyed the appetizer sampler, it was  ALOT of food (I shared and still had a lot of leftovers) and it cost $14.95 (the gyro platter was only $7.95 - is that me being cheap?). I would have much rather had smaller portions of each with maybe two falafel. It would have been perfect.   But really...I will definitely go back to this place when I can...it's a bit of drive for me, but it's well worth it!",

Liked it so much I went back for diner the following night.  Had the Gyro salad, with a side of falafels, and an appetizer of, I forget the name, but it was fried cheese, VERY good. The falafels were not dry, came with an delicious sauce and went well with the salad but would be great by itself too. Lots of people order salads there it seems, and their olive oil was extremely good.  Met the owner, who was very nice. He truly is a fat Greek :)  He's happy and takes pride in his restaurant.  I highly recommend The Fat Greek for lunch or diner!",

My husband and I split the Combination Plate For Two which has enough food that it could have been a dinner for four. Great portion sizes and fair prices. This dish has a little bit of everything,  Moussaka, Pasticcio, Gyro, Dolmades, Roasted Potatoes and Tiropita and was a great way for us to try some Greek dishes. Amazing, I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying the baklava is the best I've ever had, hands down; however, that's the only silver lining. The food is mediocre and over priced and they do charge extra for every side condiment. The reason for this review is why I will never come back. The restaurant had just closed maybe 4 minutes ago and we tried to get a last minute baklava since it is already made so all they have to do is ring it up. We came another time before about five minutes late again and the male sever gave it to us no problem. This time there was a female server and she adamantly told us no. She was very rude for selling a simple item. I understand they had just closed, but really took no effort on her part. Needless to say, that server is not too customer friendly for a town based on hospitality. Too many other restaurants that try harder to cater to customers for me to waste my money there, no matter how good the baklava is.",

The salad was delicious, as were the roasted tomatoes and peppers, but the skewers were amazing.  The lamb and chicken skewers were so good you want to keep eating long after you're full.

I had lentil soup, it's not spicy enough and too much tomatoes for me.  We also ordered a side of Tabboula salad ($4.50) which is fresh and good portion.  I also like the grilled veggie on the side.  Not too much rice.  Total is less than $20.  Definitely, we'll come back again to try their gyro plate and the other stuff.",

It's not cozy, it's decorated in traditional blue and white, with some grapes here and there, but once you sit down you realize....you're here to eat.  The Fat Greek is family owned and operated....and they are so happy to help you choose  something wonderful from their menu.  I recommend a bottle or two of Mythos beer, (oh yeah, they have a full bar. OPA!) and the beef kabob, with a appetizer of their homemade Hummus and fresh pita's.  WORD to the taste buds.",

It was hidden away in a strip mall, so you know the food had to be delicious. unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to try it. Walking into the brightly lit diner, there were 6 tables that were eating their food and a customer at the cash register. After a few minutes the man working asked if we were placing an order to go. When we told him we were dining in, he said we could sit anywhere. And sit we did. For about 20 minutes. He appeared to be the only employee working so we cut him some slack. He was running food and finally gave the woman in line her order. Once he was done he disappeared. He walked by our table about 10 times and we never received a menu, so unfortunately I'll never know what goodness I missed. If this place is too busy to pay attention to customers, I can go elsewhere.",

We both had the gyro plate, wish I had known they offer big portions,  we could not finish it! The meat was very tender and flavorful. I can not comment on the baklava because we have not made it home yet so have not been able to take a bite. Cant wait! Definately will come back and try other dishes. The service, meh!

Ten grape leaves, some kebabs, an avgolemono soup and spanakopita later, we were two very happy people splitting a very good carrot cake. My husband was a little sad to hear that the bakhlava was not yet ready but my waistline needed a little break before trying that item too. Very cute cafe, helpful staff and best avgolemono and dolmades ever. We did pick a great neighborhood!!!",

    "text": "I've tried a few greek places in town but nothing ever bowled me over. It was always \"good\" but nothing I bit into and just couldn't stop! Today I forgot my lunch at work and ran out to find something. On a whim I saw a sign that said Greek Food and a Gyro sounded good. After a minute or so looking through the strip mall, I found The Fat Greek and walked inside.   It's what you can expect from a Mom and Pop place, clean but very minimal and a little kitch. I grabbed a menu when a very friendly woman with what I'm guessing is a Greek accent asked me if I wanted to eat there or togo. I ordered the Beef/Lamb Fat Greek Gyro togo with fries. This was a slight upgrade from the regular Gyro as it had Feta and a few other things.  The food came out super fast and hot. I hopped back in my car and headed back to the office. When I picked up the gyro I noticed it was HUGE and the fries were delicious. One bite of that big wrap and I couldn't stop. If someone had walked by they would have thought I hadn't eaten for weeks. The meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was to die for and the pita was soft and warm.  I may have only had the Gyro and Fries but I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer and will be trying out their hummus and other selections.",

She hasn't been there the last few times I went in. Instead, there's a couple of guys who give really bad attitude, to the point that it's insulting. I've spent a lot of money at this place over the last 3 years or so, and to be treated so poorly by these guys is pretty mind boggling. The food is still great, but spending money to be treated like shit by a couple of slimy weasels isn't really my thing. Sorry you doofuses hate your jobs, but have a little pride in what you do, or find something else.   Hey management: Get rid of these guys and bring back the lady that used to work there! I hope she's ok!  EDIT: I've heard that the lady is back. Going to give the Fat Greek another try!",

First the positives, my waiter was extremely nice and attentive when he was at my table, I ordered the fried calamari which was better than I remember, all of the food was extremely fresh. Now the negatives, it was fairly busy for a Friday night and there was only one waiter for everyone. The poor guy was running all over trying to keep up. The menu has changed and unfortunately they got rid of my favorite item, the shwarma. I attempted to order several things off of the menu and they appearantly were out, very dissapointing!

We made our sandwiches a combo and were treated to a lovely crisp greek salad with impeccably fresh veggies, salty feta, and a deliciously lemony dressing.

    "text": "I had the pleasure of calling Las Vegas (among a few other cities) home in my pre-yelp days. Back then we tried Fat Greek at least once as we lived in the neighboring Chinatown, though I have no recollection of anything we ate there.  We found ourselves in Vegas again this week. When Fat Greek showed up on my yelp search with glowing reviews, I know we had to try it again.   It was Tuesday at noon with record high temperature (for Vegas) and this place was packed. As I noticed only two servers were working the entire dinning room with at least half of the tables having no food on them, I was a bit worried about the wait and service but it's too hot to go outside again.   We grabbed the last empty table, and one of the servers promptly provided us with the menus. I have always enjoyed the appetizer selections in Greek/Meditteranean cuisine, so I suggested to my companion that we order the appetizer combo (which offers four different cold appetizers of our choice), and he obliged (a rarity that is). It took the server a while to come back to us, but we could see how busy she was and how fast she was moving so we made no fuss about it. I asked her about some of the appetizers since no description was given on the menu and she was helpful. We decided to try the Tirokefteri (whipped feta cheese) based on her recommendation plus our old standby Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Rice Dolmades. In addition, we ordered the Spanakopita.   We got our food 15 minutes later and the 4 appetizers were neatly arranged on two oblong platters with plenty of warm pita wedges around. I first attacked the Dolmades but I was disappointed because the rice was too firm to my liking. To be fair, my companion had no problem with the rice texture and he gladly finished the other pieces on the plate, so I guess it must be personal preference. I also like the filling to be a mixture of rice and meat but they did specify these to be Rice Dolmades on the menu. Hummus was very smooth with a nice hint of Tahini though I would not mind more Tahini in it. Baba Ghanoush was solid, but the real winner was the cheese dish Tirokefteri. We will have to seek it out in our future visits to any Greek/Meditteranean restaurant.   Most places just reheat their pre-made Spanakopita in a microwave when you order but their Spanakopita tasted like fresh out of oven.   We enjoyed our food but I was more impressed by the kitchen staff (a small one it is from what I could tell) and the two young servers for keeping it calm during rush hour. I did ask her if they were short-handed that day and she said not really just everybody came in at one time.   One of the great things about Yelp is to keep the memory alive. Now I can't blame on my early-onset Alzheimer's any more.",

To be honest, we almost didn't go in when we got there.  They had a display window at the counter and it was completely empty, which threw me off.  Why was it empty?  Where was the baklava?

My friend convinced me to go and it was delicious! I had a gyro and rice. We had a side of hummus with pita and he had falafel. He said his was good but I didn't try it. Now, about the gyro. Wow! I'm actually amazed about how good it was. I never eat tomato on a sandwich but chose to leave it to get the traditional experience. I also don't like the type of cheese on it or yogurt sauces but let me tell you, somehow putting them all together tasted fabulous! I can't wait to try it again and have been telling my friends to try it. The hummus was hummus. Nothing spectacular but also not bad. The rice I had on the side was also delicious!! It had garlic in it and was cooked perfectly. Honestly, it was good enough to go back just for the rice.   The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the table was covered in a disposable paper table cover. It made it feel very cheap. You also seat yourself (which I tend to not like if I'm eating somewhere other than fast food). I think with just a few changes this place could be awesome. The food certainly is!   Quick note on the service. It was fast and timely but we were also the only people in the restaurant.",

Also, extremely upset with how management talks to their customers when said customer is voicing concerns over quality of food and timeliness.   I was spending 20$ 3x a week here for the past 3 weeks. But I'm so done with this place. Taking my money elsewhere, where my consistent business will be appreciated!",

    "text": "So glad I discovered this place, tucked away in a mall on the NW corner of Decatur and Flamingo. It's sort of near the supermarket.   A really great menu with lots of items and all of the classic Greek dishes, including avgolemono, one of my fave soups with chicken, lemon, and rice. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering that the food quality is good and everything I've had so far is tasty. The dining room is open and spacious--easy for large or small parties.  I definitely recommend this place. It's not for upscale dining, but it fulfills the need for a good neighborhood spot. And it's suitable for different eating types--vegetarian, keto, etc.",

Although there was only one very busy woman taking care of the front of the house, we were amazed at the fabulous food and service provided.  The lamb dishes, shank & kabobs, were cooked to perfection, flavors were delicious and spot on for the rice and grilled vegetables provided with the meals.  The hummus & feta were the best I've ever had, and the wine was delish with the lamb.  Definitely will be repeat customer as long as they continue to match the flavorful consistency we experienced. Well deserved 5 stars for the flavorful mouth explosions we all experienced.",

    "text": "The Fat Greek is something I like to call a hidden Mediterranean gem! Its always the best of places that are located in weird setups like shopping centers or even behind random buildings or plazas.   The Fat Greek is no different! I've been here several times and I could just kick myself for never doing a review! Most recently my co-worker and I were out on a business appointment and couldn't decide on where to go for lunch. I was in the mood for some Mediterranean type of food but a dish that would be light at the same time. Craving a salad of some sort I couldn't put my finger on exactly the type I wanted though. Based off the area we were already in The Fat Greek popped into mind and we both said \"YES!!! I Love that place\" (At the same time).  Around lunch time I was expecting for them to be busy especially based off the amount of cars that were outside. These people must've been at the grocery store or some of the other places inside of the shopping center because when we walked in there were a fair amount of people but definitely way less than what we had anticipated! Once we arrived, we were greeted immediately by a couple of the employees and seated right away! Talk about a SCORE! So what was for lunch?  Appetizer-  Two of The Avgolemono Soups: Chicken, with Lemon and Rice  Lunch-  Two of the Fat Greek Salads w/ Grilled Chicken: Crisp Romaine Heart, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Crumbled Feta, Red onion and Kalamata Olives  Overall lunch was super delicious and the service was great! I have to stop forgetting about this place and visit a lot more often. I forgot exactly how good they are and how fast the service is when you want to grab a quick bite to eat on a lunch break.",

Instead of trying to listen he said it common since it doesn't come with fries. He refused to remove the tip!! Refused to refund the tip even and basically calls me stupid! Wow the owner!!!   Now to the food. Gross!! Some meat is cold some hot, some is chewy some is soft. I asked for easy sauce and got way too much. The cheese is just splattered on top, the back half had most of the cheese so you need to spread and rewrap them.   The soup was mostly water!!!! No chunks, just very minimal shreds of chicken. Decent flavor but bad value.   2 star on food but the owner made it a 0 star experience. He was the rudest thief I've ever spoke with. Never again!",

The Fat Greek was the main one to catch our attention. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted and sat at a table quickly. We went around dinnertime during a weeknight, so the place wasn't too packed. But, apparently when you dine there for dinner, the pita bread and what ever that other amazing bread was called is complimentary. And just like any other, well I should say most, Greek restaurants that I've been to, we were given large portions for our meals. The food was delicious and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. I feel like the food was decently priced and you definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend to try this place out if you want to avoid the high food prices from restaurants on the strip and/or if you're hungry and want amazing Greek food!  5/5 from me for the food and amazing service!",

(and I have heard from friends that service here isn't the greatest when eating in... )   After a handful of visits, which I was helped by the same sweet lady each time, I feel comfortable giving The Fat Greek 4 stars. The Fat Greek is in the shopping plaza on Flamingo and Decatur, near the grocery store. I have been to that plaza dozens of times before I noticed The Fat Greek, it's a bit hidden where it's located.   A quick rundown of what I had had:  The Fat Gyro - So fat, it was multiple meals. They do not skimp on the meat, and the veggies are super fresh.   The Fat Salad -With chicken added (at an extra cost) this was also a huge portion that I was unable to finish in one sitting.  Souvlaki - Chicken, lamb or beef kabobs served with rice or fries. The beef, cooked medium rare, are delicious.   The hummus and pita bread here are solid choices, not the best in town in my opinion but close!   For takeout, I highly recommend calling your order in.",

However, the last few times I've ordered food to go from here it's been disappointing. Normally it was always good. Yes I've always had to wait a little bit even when I called before I would pick it up. Now they tell me it's going to be ready in 10 min and every time we've ordered I've asked for them to not put the pepper things in our to go boxes because we don't eat them and they've put them in there. This last time they even put 2 when I reminded him I didn't want them and they could save them for someone else. We order just the gyro combos that come with fries and a drink and these past few times they just haven't tasted the same or as good as before.   Not sure if they got new owners but it's unfortunate because we really did enjoy the food. We'll be looking for a new place to get Gyros from.",

The place is very casual nothing fancy and our favorite is the avoglemono (lemon rice) soup!! The falafel is excellently made and the service is very quick even if the place is full. Everything is fresh and we always make a point to come when we are near this side of town! Please don't ever change!! Great food, excellent service!",

    "text": "Las Vegas Yelpers!!!  Thanks so much for the reviews! I recently moved to 702 and I wanted to see where I could find a yummy greek spot! After doing a quick search on yelp... The Fat Greek was on my hit list!  I'm a huge gyro fan and after eating at Papa Cristos in LA numerous times over the past 2 years... I was hoping to find a spot in Vegas that could fill my void of having Papa Cristos withdraws.  Came here on Valentine's Day for lunch with my friend visiting town from San Diego. We both ordered the Fat Greek gyro (lamb/beef)... be prepared to get messy! I had feta cheese and talziki sauce on my face the whole time! gyros are super messy! haha.  I'm a huge fan of their fat greek gyro!!! love the feta cheese :)) pita bread and lamb/beef were on point. Super huge... you can split it with someone if you're no that hungry!  I will be back when I'm craving for a gyro!  Indoor/outdoor seating (no wait). casual dining (love the classic bright blue and white theme). private parking lot (no problems with parking). Decent prices.  If you're a Vegas local or visiting... and hungry for greek... stop by The Fat Greek!  -Miss Yelp 2011",

    "text": "I have a 6th sense. When one of my girlfriends are pregnant, I get the cravings... long before they even disclose their little secret! So girls, whoever you are - SPILL!!! I've been craving Greek lately, and when I say \"crave,\" I mean I want it every meal and every snack of everyday. And this has been my life for the past three weeks. So, while on a business trip to Vegas I turned to YELP to feed my addictions. (Food.)   Such an unassuming place in an off strip shopping center. I was a little hesitant when I walked in and only 1/4 of the tables were taken... but I was hungry, and I have a lot of faith in yelpers. =)  End result - HAPPY TUMMY. Really happy tummy. It's a mom n pop type joint, with all the home cooking \"made with love\" flavors. Here's the rundown:  Hummus: Homemade, and awesome. So many times hummus comes out runny, oily, or slightly gritty. Not here - it has the perfect consistency, taste on point, and made my taste buds sing. Maybe even RAP a bit, that's how good it was. ha ha.  Chicken Lemon Soup: I have nothing to compare this to, never had it before... but boy was it good. You would think I haven't eaten in weeks the way I slurped it down. In all honesty, I think I slurped it a little too loud.  Beef Gyro: So good I didn't speak. Not one word. I didn't put it down for a good 5 bites.   Greek Salad: Good, but didn't blow my mind. I added chicken, and was pleased with the portion size!  Falafel: Soooooo glad this wasn't the greasy mess I'm used to. Great infused flavors, crispy on the outside, perfect on the inside!  Baklava: Good sized portion, but not the best I've had...  Ready for the star of the show?  Chocolate Marble Truffle Cake: I have no words. None. Order it, eat it, and then get one to go. Period. You're welcome.  Needless to say, I'll be coming back!",

    "text": "Removing 2 Stars.....1 for spotty service from the Greek waiter. Homeboy acted like he had a BIG stick up his behind... no customer service skills at all.  We shared the Avgolemono(Egg and Lemon Soup with chicken and rice) good flavor, came with warm pita bread, so far so good.  wifey orders a Chicken Gyro, I go with the Chicken Shawerma, and we both share the Athenian Fries. Fries were good, But I still prefer Greek Bistro's Greek Fries seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and Zatar, served with a yogurt dip.  Both the Gyro and Shawerma  were made with chicken breast that was definitely grilled and sliced WAY AHEAD OF TIME, and was borderline room temp./cold( probably from lunch), and our pita bread was cold and tough! The pita that came with our soup was hotter! For dessert, the nice waitress (who got my to-go order in my first review) was much more informative about the menu and very personable. We get the Baklava and the Bugacha.(Greek puff pastry dessert filled with vanilla(or chocolate )pastry cream. Baklava was overly sweet, but the bugacha was crisp, warm, and not too sweet. Decent ending to our pretty disappointing meal. Bad first impression for the wifey and I felt worse after \"hyping\" this place up after my first visit. Hard to say if we'll be back...ALOHA!!!",

That bite of feta finishes the salad off with just the right amount of creaminess.  Now for the Greek potatoes... served piping hot!  Three huge wedges perfectly fried and perfectly seasoned.

The inside could use a little sprucing up, but it's not all that bad. The menu has traditional Greek options and \"safe\" options for those who aren't a fan of traditional Greek cuisine.  I ordered the Fat Greek gyro and I was more than pleased with the abundance of the lamb/beef meat combo and flavor.  The gyro was well dressed with fresh lettuce, tomato, and tangy tzatziki sauce.

I probably get something from here maybe 3 times in a month honestly, because I just want to live here already. My favorite dish is a shawarma meal with any meat... any time. Their fries are so crunchy and well seasoned and may I recommend dipping them in tatziki! I've had a lot on their menu and have been thoroughly satisfied with the flavor, quality and authenticity with each bite. I 100 percent always recommend this place. The service, atmosphere and price will impressed you as well!",

    "text": "Good food. Good price . The avgolemeno soup may be a little over seasoned for some but was still very good . Gyro was good and the satziki sauce was mild . They definitely need to update their seating . Look closely at the seats they are all in need of repair or painting over . The back kitchen cook and one of the servers shared too much info and personal conversations that could clearly and loudly be heard in the dining area. Also puzzling why the big screen tv in the dining area is tuned to the food channel. I began watching and wondering why I wasn't going to a different restaurant to eat the food that I was watching on tv instead of what I had available at this restaurant.  Summary - good food good price - update the seating and cut back on the loud kitchen conversation.",

We are glad we did.   There were 5 of us including children.  We were hungry so we started with the hummus.  Delicious.  Could always have more pita.   3 of us ordered the Gyros plate.  We should have only ordered 2 because there was so much food!!!!   The avlogmeno (?) soup was Real, not chicken condensed soup with shredded chicken, rice and lemon.  This was the Real Thing and it was delicious!   The salads that came with the plates were huge and very good.  The homemade dressing was not overly spiced with oregano like some places make.  It had multi lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, and feta.  It was really good.   My husband, being very hungry when we ordered, ordered the Pork Chop.  OMG!!  It was, by far, the most delicious pork chop we have ever eaten.  Perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection.  The potatoes and vegetables that came with it were just as good.   They do need to employ more help.  Our waiter was practically running the whole time, so management, listen up!  Hire a buser.",

Saganaki was a little disappointing- nice flavor, but it was not served flaming and the cheese needs to bubble or it's just not right. Greek salad, chicken skewers and moussaka were great. Service was kind of funny- 3 different people waited on us. All were friendly enough, but they didn't bring the salad (got it to go_, didn't refill drinks without frantic waving, and took forever wiht the check.

    "text": "This place has the BEST Greek food in the entire city & my favorite tzatziki in the country. (Hummus Factory does have better hummus varieties... LOL)   This is my go-to takeout place when I want something not overly-processed, really delicious & quick. The food is all packaged separately, and tzatziki left on the side so it travels well. The gyro plate could not be a better deal, or lamb/beef quality. The gyro plate comes with side of soup/salad, french fries or rice, and your traditional Greek lamb/beef gyro. SO GOOD!   The Fat Greek is also a great location to dine-in (nice traditional interior), and receive great personalized service. There is a female who works here (I do not remember her name) and she truly takes the time to get to know her customers. We frequently order an extra side of gyro meat (for our dog), and she became aware of this. One day we did not order any extra gyro meat (our dog had traveled back East) and she asked if our dog was okay! She truly remembered & this meant so much to us. She has become a friendly acquaintance, and truly enjoy seeing her every-time we go there.   Besides the gyro plate with greek salad & fries (I always get), the Moussaka is traditional and cooked perfectly, and the pita bread is home-made/ always fresh. The Athenian fries are deliciously savory & the Spanakopita is never burnt/over oily. I always order two pieces of baklava, & my boyfriend loves the rice pilaf here. Truly a great place for traditional treats, and the mid-week i-do-not-want-to-cook blues. Love this place & will continue to be a frequent customer! Give it a try if you love Greek Food!",

    "text": "I just love Greek food and the Fat Greek has my favorite item - the Gryo Plate.  Theirs come with a good amount of meat and we chose rice and salad.  Unlike another spot we have been too Fat Greek gives you a hearty amount of rice and salad each packed in their own container.       We also got sides of Gyro meat and the ever popular Athena Fries.  The fries were a delight and were devoured quickly.  The combination of spices and the two cheeses was so good.  The rice was very tasty and the salad was really good.  Fresh Romaine lettuce tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of feta.      I have eaten in and now taken out.  I think I prefer take out.  The dining room is basic and although clean has a tired look about it.  The lady who has taken our order isn't very friendly and lacks in her customer service skills.  I didn't take it personally and think it is just her demeanor.      So far Fat Greek is the best Greek place for Gyro's that i have found in Vegas.  In comparison to Sharma Plus you get near twice as much food for the same cost.  One thing that also stands out is the Tzatziki sauce is very good and plentiful.  A great price for a plentiful Gryo Plate.  I will definitely be back for my next Gyro fix!",

    "text": "I have never experienced this nadir of service in my entire life.  My lady and I stepped into this restaurant with high expectations after seeing the yelp rating and reviews. We stood there awkwardly for about a minute watching people eat and look in our direction before a waiter asked us to choose any seat. Slow considering we were the only ones standing and waiting to be seated, but not so bad.  We sat down at our seats deciding what to order. For 15 MINUTES. No one came over to take even our drink order. We may as well have been invisible. Right in front of us there was another couple who had arrived just before us and had already ordered and RECEIVED THEIR FOOD.  This is beyond poor service. \"We were busy\" is no excuse. I have been to much busier and hectic restaurants and received prompter attention. There was no one else waiting in line before or after us and everyone else was just eating or waiting for their food.  If you want to feel like a minority before the civil rights movement, feel free to drop in for a bite. You won't be disappointed. I \"wasn't\".  We drove 1 mile to Thai Style Noodle House and was eating our delicious Pad Thai and Papaya Salad in less than 10 minutes.  TLDR;- Ambience - 0/5 (didn't get to experience much of it) Food - 0/5 (no food ordered) Service - 0/5 (easily my worst experience at any restaurant and I'm usually very understanding) Overall - 0/5 (yelp doesn't allow zeros unfortunately)  We walked out after 15 minutes of waiting at our table and didn't look back.",

If it wasn't for that I think it would have been good because the filling was tasty. The chicken souvlaki and fries were good. Overall the food was ok but gave an extra star for the service.

I went several months ago at 8pm, they close at 9 and I was told that the kitchen was already closed and they refused to serve me, even for take out. I had just gotten back into town and was starving and wanted a delicious Greek meal that I craved for so many months away. NOPE!  So anyway, decided to give it another shot. Bad idea. It was empty but service was still slow, no authentic Greek music playing anymore and the food was terrible. I ordered the saganaki, it came to the table COLD and without any lemon and it is also a different type of cheese. Then for the entree, the gyro was SO dry, I wasn't even able to choke it all down. The plate didnt even come with tzatziki, which is a traditional accompaniment to gyro. Then when I asked the server for it, he had no idea what it was (Hispanic server). Then a few minutes later a cook came from the back and gave me a mean face.  I'll never go back here again...there's a reason why they're totally empty on a Saturday night.",

My partner ordered the gyro plate.  The strips of beef had nice flavor and was very tender.  The sauce was tasty. Bother portions were large.  We had plenty left over for lunch the next day. Other menu items looks good as well.  We will be back!",

But still their service was horrible. We sat down and had to wait literally for about 15-20 mins for the waiter to drop by. Our food took about 30 mins+ to get delivered to our table. It seems like there is only 1 person waiting the tables - instead of waiting for the waiter to come, we decided to walk upto the counter and pay our check. But the owner told us that you have to wait for that 1 person who is also serving others. I couldn't believe it - as a owner, you should be able to do the job yourself and not rely on the hired help so much. Anyhow, we wasted our time and money for a less than mediocre experience.",

There were two occupied tables and a small group of people standing close to the tables.  There was a gentleman standing in front of the counter waiting to be helped.  There was a worker behind the counter talking on the phone, and another worker standing next to him. I was not acknowledge by anybody in the restaurant, matter of fact, the person on the phone turned his back to us and continued to talk on the phone.  The other worker walk out from behind the counter and walked over to the occupied tables and had a conversation there, then returned to the counter, still no acknowledgement of our presence. After waiting 5 minutes, I walked out. I am sure their food is delicious since the reviews were good.  Unfortunately, I will never know.",

I had a rare and sudden craving for Greek food and but have no experience with nearby Greek restaurants.  Found them on yelp, looked at the solid 4 star rating and ordered by phone from their online menu without ever reading a review. I picked it up 15 minutes later.  I barely had to wait at all as the order was just being packed up as I arrived.  We got the small Fat Greek Salad.. (not small and very good) a order of Tabouli that was delicious, and split a skewer each of marinated chicken/beef Souvlaki, that was very tasty.  I order a Pita and Hummus side and then when picking the order up added in a Tiramisu desert.  The Tiramisu was a nice surprise! My wife who is European thought it was a bit too sweet, but I, being very American, thought it was perfect! :-)  We will definitely eat there in the future.  The restaurant itself, being mid-afternoon had nice window lighting and was bright and cheery in blues and whites and looked spotless.  They have an outside patio and are in the corner of the center, easy parking. The dessert selection (a weakness I admit) looked great, and we really enjoyed our afternoon meal at home with some great Greek food",

And you can stop by Food 4 Less next door and stock up on snacks and drinks.  The restaurant itself is very clean and has a nice ambiance.  The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. I've been there twice.  The first time I had the greek salad with grilled chicken and the second time I had the gyro plate, which is a ton of food.  All of it great.  Definitely recommend this restaurant for a chance of pace from Strip food.",

Run-down strip mall, corner-deli-style building.  But the FOOD will make you forget all about this. :)  The Service-  Authentic Greek!  Sweet.   Um... but... there was only one server, and once the lunch rush started we were kind of ignored.  He was very patient and explained all the foreign-sounding dishes to us, though.  The Food- Awww yeah.  Reasonably priced enough that I could justify ordering one of pretty much everything:   --Tzatziki (yogurt + cucumber) was fresh and delicious --Baba ganoush and hummus were also right on par --Tirokefteri (new to me: creamy cheese spread with spice) was delicious! --Saganaki- salty fried cheese, went well with the milder baba ganoush/ hummus...but *very salty on its own* --The soups were good, but I'm meh about soups --The lamb gyro was delicious!!  Gamey and cooked just right, with a great combo of flavors.. With all the soft fresh pitas we ate as appetizers, I didn't really have much of an appetite left (should've ordered the lamb souvlaki/skewers) but I ate the gyro afterwards, cold, and it was still FANTASTIC.  Take that how you will.  GO!  For a great meal in Vegas at a GREAT price, this is IT.",

    "text": "What a delightful little place!   I love Mediterranean food, and this is my go-to place for tasty Greek cuisine. It's tucked away in a corner of the Ricardo's/Food4Less strip mall on Flamingo & Decatur, and conveniently located a few blocks from my boyfriend's apartment. The inside is clean, bright, and has a charming blue and white Greek theme (go figure). The service is friendly and more than adequate.   After getting food here at least a dozen times, I can say that dine-in or take-out items are equally delicious.  I would rate the prices as being moderate, ( Apps run about $6-$11, Dinner entrees range from around $13-$20) but the quality food is well worth the extra few dollars you might save by going to a chain such as The Mad Greek (mediocre at best).  I particularly enjoy the gyros, but my favorite way to eat here is to bring a few friends and order a bunch of appetizers and sides to share. I regularly order the hummus, tzatziki, spanakopita, and a few side order chicken kebabs for a quick Greek feast. I also highly recommend the desserts. I'm not sure if they are house made, but they are delectable! (Try the galaktoboureko if they've got it - it's a scrumptious pairing of phyllo pastry and custard)  Overall, I love this place, and I think you will too. Stin Iyiamas!",

Different from my mom's, but still tasty.  The baklava was pretty good...they had like three varieties.   I don't like the location, even tho it's close to my house. The Food4Less parking lot that they share is shady and you can't really see your car from the restaurant.

They dropped the food off and then didn't check up on us. We needed pita bread and had to flag someone down for it. Then I needed an iced tea refill but again no one came to check on us. All I saw was Gina standing at the counter a lot. Gina came to drop our bill off and asked if we needed anything else and I told her how disappointed we were with the service and that yes I did need a refill and even more pita bread (they give a lot of hummus and not a lot of bread). She goes on to inform me that we walked in when the kitchen was closed. OKAY why would you not tell us that when we sat down then??? She was very rude and I couldn't believe the way she approached the situation. I will literally never come back here again. Which is sad because I've been coming here for years.

I like this place and the fact that when you walk in and its decorated with \"Greek colors.\" I came here on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty packed. That was definitely a good sign! My friends both ordered the Fat Greek Gyro and I just ordered the Traditional Gyro. The Traditional Gyro was tasty, but I felt the pita bread was a bit too tough. The rice pilaf was good, but extremely buttery. My friend ordered the \"Greek\" fries and it came with melted feta cheese on top. It looked good, but I was too full to even try it. Overall, I think the lunch combo is decent deal and I will be back when I need a good gyro.",

I haven't had many things on their menu, but I do LOVE what I've had so far . . . fat greek gyro, soulvaki pita, the chicken greek salad, tabbouli salad, and falafel.  Each time I think I'll try something else, but I always end up right back with my fave, the orginal fat gyro!!   The GYRO with LAMB really satisfies, it is delish, the meat is perfectly flavored and in my three experiences, always prepared perfectly!!  The lunch combo comes with the gyro and a side (I had the greek salad, but you can also do rice, I think) and a drink all for just under $10.  Not bad.  It gets a little busy at lunch time, we always try to sneak in at 11:30 to avoid the rush -- just a little tip.  By 12:30 when we leave, it's full.    Service is great -- very casual, but very helpful and kind.  They are quick with your order, refills and the check too!    If you're in the area -- definitely stop in!!",

The restaurant wasn't busy which probably has a lot to do with the brief wait time. Walking up to restaurant the first thing I see is a sleek motorcycle. This made me chuckle b/c my cousin in Greece posts a lot of pictures of motorcycles so seeing one made me think it might be a Greek thing. In the restaurant there were a few people seated for full-service and then 2 couples waiting for take-out.  The man who took my order was unenthusiastic. Efficient but slightly unfriendly. I order The Fat Greek Gyro, beef and rice Dolmades, and baklava. I also wanted spanakopita but they were out. During my 30-minute drive to home I ate the baklava.  It was good but could have been better with more nuts. I tried one of the dolmades and it lacked seasoning and \"zest\". I was worried that the gyro might be disappointing. Fortunately, I was NOT disappointed by the gyro.  It tasted great even after 30 minutes of sitting in the car during my commute home.  The Fat Greek pulled a lousy review \"out of the fire\" by providing an excellent gyro which was the one reason I went into the restaurant.",

From the time of order, to it arriving in the hotel lobby was about 40 minutes.... not bad.  The gyros, like previous posts, was off the charts!  I love lemon avegolemono (I know I spelled that wrong) soup -- this was so lemony and silky!  My kids thought it was too tangy, but they still ate it.  The salad was also well done!   Amazing.  THe next night, we ordered from here again (we are in from out of town and my daughter had a temperature, so we spent our vacation in our hotel room).... this time, it took 95 minutes to get here.... the food arrived leaking and they were missing a soup... I didn't want to call back and wait for another 95 minutes, we ordered plenty and the soup was just part of a meal.... there was just salad dressing all over the place.  And the food was tepid at best.  The food was still great, but this put a real damper on everything.   This time we got shrimp skewers, and my son devoured them... he loved them and we also ordered the baklava.... it was ok... but the real star of the show are the gyros....and for me, the salad....",

Ordering was easy and I received a text almost immediately from them to let me know they were out of two items we ordered and would we like something else.  I adjusted our order by text and they said they would have it to us shortly.  They took FOREVER to get our food to us, over 1.5 hours.  They also must have been out of rice, since none of our dishes had rice.  They substituted it with veggies.  Not happy about that, but the quality of the food made up for any upset we had.  All four of us ate ALL our food and enjoyed every bite.  We ordered lamb rack, lamb wrap, beef kabob plate and sauteed shrimp.  The shrimp was devine, perfectly cooked and delicious.  All our meals were super tasty, the meat cooked properly and the veggies were very good too.  Definitely on our list of eat in places in Vegas from now on.  Everyone employee we spoke with including the driver was friendly and personable.",

Their rice pilaf is not buttery it's very lemony. I wasn't a big fan. I think it's funny how they have the food network playing while we eat but on mute. Kinda not a good thing when they are showing stuff that looks so moist and yummy and I get my falafel and it's extremely dry. Mind you it's my first time trying it and I am not a fan. It comes on top of hummus with a big pile of diced up tomatoes, onions and cucumber. My friend who loves falafel said it was a bit dry. I ordered the gyro meat plate and it came with the rice pilaf. Some of the meat was very dry seemed like it might have been there a while. The taziki sauce was a let down I was expecting some cucumber and hoping for a bit of mint. It was just yogurt and dill with some lime or lemon juice. My friend had the lamb shank he said it was good. The hummus was good and the pita bread soft.   It's not a place I will be coming back too anytime soon. If I do I'll get the fries.",

    "text": "The Fat Greek is a great spot for Greek and Mediterranean cuisine.  Gets pretty busy for lunch during the weekdays since it's conveniently located at the northwest shopping center off flamingo and Decatur.  The food has stayed consistent since the original owner passed away and I almost always start with the avgolemeno soup (lemon chicken rice).  You can't go wrong with the gyro selection and I recommend the traditional, fat Greek or kefte kabob sandwich.  The desserts are freshly prepared and extremely delicious especially the baklava.  My favorite is the Napoleon which can be made upon order.  The decor is very Mediterranean with light blue painted walls and accents reflecting traditional Greek colors.  Definitely a hole in the wall cafe that has expanded since opening many years ago and become a staple in my diet.",

    "text": "THE FAT GREEK - THE //Freaken.Addictive.Tasty// GREEK  As you walk in it seemed like a place where you order up front & then wait for your food... it is a sit down resteraunt. I was stupid & tried to order at the register my first time.   The inside is petite but the tables are well spaced with enough room so you don't feel so stuffy. Like  most greek resteraunt the interior decor was all blue & trims of white with random white pillars placed all around. The location for this place is easy to miss but it is right next to Ralphs grocery store in the same plaza as boiling crab.  Staff was friendly & I had to see the most halarious judgemental facial expression our server gave us when he saw that we finished our food... it was a look of surprise & just dumfounded ahahaha Also the comment of the lady that dropped off our food was \"O my you guys ordered too much food\"  for some reason because it is more of a family owned & the reactions were sincere & cute in my opinion ahahha but also used to the expression since we get it a lot...  HUMMUS & PITA 5.75 - Enough citrus & enough garlic to actually taste it. I would have to say the BEST hummus I have tasted thus far. The pitas were also nice & hot although not enough... but you can get another side order for only a $1  FAT GREEK SALAD 7.95 - my mommy used to own a salad shop so there is a specific flavor profile I expect from the dressing for a greek salad & this place brought back my childhood memories! Also they give a great amount of feta cheese to go w/ every bite you take.  GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST 11.95 - a little too healthy for my taste buds but my fiance really appreciated since he likes to be healthy when it comes to choosing dishes. But still the chicken was tender & the pilaf rice was perfect. The dish also came with some fat fries which were soft on the inside & crispy outter.  CHICKEN FAT GREEK GYRO 7.95 - they don't lie when it says FAT gyro... i literally have to take out half of the cut grilled sliced chickens so that I could actually pick up the gyro & eat it instead of trying to fork & knife it. The rest of the chicken I add to the Greek salad =]  BEEF FAT GREEK GYRO 7.95 - juicy pieces of meat & no need to pull it out because the are more flat pieces... but absolutely flavorful and juicy... although I wasn't sure if it was a beef & lamb mix or not.  FRIES 2.00 - fat fries & boat bowls worth which is a lot for only $2  BAKLAVA 4.50 - it had enough crunch to every bite... but i also have never had bad baklava =]",

I do like the food so I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I came again last week around 1 and it was dead. There were maybe 4 other tables dining, and I received excellent service.   I had a cup of the Avgolemeno soup which was very tasty and lemony and came with a side of warm pita. I love this soup, but I just wish it was a little hotter in temperature as it was served lukewarm. I also had the fat gyro which is a gyro with feta, lettuce, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce. I love the addition of feta to any gyro. It adds a salty element that just enhances the flavors. I asked for the tzatziki sauce on the side and while it was a nice complement to the gyro, I didn't particularly care for the flavor.   I really like this place and if they just had one more person working the lunch rush, I think this could be a 5 star establishment.",

The falafel balls were ginormous. Crispy on the outside. But the inside had a mashed potatoe consistency.  Marjie think yucki. Not yummilishous. And. The falafels were hot. As in hot chili pepper hot.  Not yummi when mouth on fire. Inedible. Marjie not happy.",

The last two times in the restaurant, we were completely ignored, food took an hour to come out even though we saw delivery bag after delivery bag leaving the kitchen.  When the  food came it was served by a grumpy waiter and it was cold.  I figured we'd move to ordering delivery since that seems to be their focus.  The food was good but, unfortunately, this time left all of us running for the bathroom the rest of the afternoon.  When I called the third party delivery service to warn them, I was treated like I was trying to get a freebie when I was just genuinely concerned for their customers.  Evidently when three customers only complain it's our issue, not theirs.    The message was \"I spoke to the owner, you're the only ones who complained, and he's not going to take anything off your bill so we can't refund you either.\"    I expressed the fact that I wasn't looking for a refund but was concerned for their clientele.    Sad that customer service has gone out the window, at least there are other great greek options in town.",

That large entree was only $7.50, I could not be more thrilled with food quality and the price. My co-worker got the Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken which are was HUGE and almost had two chicken breasts worth of chicken along with 4 slices of pita. Even the sides are very reasonably priced at $1 (like tzatziki sauce, hummus..etc) and come in a larger condiment container. They apparently get quite a big lunch rush but it looks like they have plenty of seats to accommodate. I can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu!",

I stopped in here after a workout and despite my sweaty appearance they were really friendly and allowed me the freedom to sit where ever I wanted. Once seated and beverage in hand, I took quite awhile to decide what I wanted to order because there were so many good options from which to choose. I ultimately chose the grilled pork chop but because it would take up to 20 minutes to cook and I was hungry, I settled with the gyro and Athenian fries. Although it wasn't my first choice it was still a rather good one! The pita and meat were the perfect temperature, the fresh veggies had the right bite/crunch and the feta was very creamy. The fries were great too, they definitely don't skimp on the feta and because I like a lot of lemon, they let me douse them in as much lemon juice as I could take. (quick tip, they broil the fries in the same dish they serve it in so don't be like me and touch the plate!)  This place has a great atmosphere, not too loud and serve a nice selection of alcohol so it's great for quick bites or a nice relaxed dinner out. I'll be returning to try that pork chop again when I'm not as ravenous from a workout. ;)",

The beef/lamb gyro was perfectly seasoned and layered with tzatziki. The side side was also fine.  The lemon drop soup, which I'm normally a huge fan of, was a miss. The soup was too dilated, and there lacked the lemon creamy punch that I've had at other restaurants, even with the extra effort to add in lemon juice with fresh lemons.   Verdict: Stick to the main courses and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "We were looking on Yelp and found this place which shows a 4 1/2 star rating and decided to give it anyway.    First impression the place looks clean and since it was between lunch and dinner it was basically empty.  We were greeted right away and told to sit anywhere.   We were brought menus and offered drinks.  While we waited on the drinks we looked over the menu.  When the waiter returned we attempted to place our order but unfortunately several items on the menu they no longer had???  Why bring us a menu with all the items on it that you do not have?  It took several minutes to find some items they actually had and can serve.  If you are updating the menu, cross off the items you do not have instead of having customers pick items and have to be told sorry we no longer have that, this makes the experience so uninviting and hard to recommend to others.  Once the food arrived, the food was actually good but was different from other greek places.  We decided to order some food to go for our daughter which he brought in a bag and we never looked at it to make sure it was what we ordered.  Of course this was our mistake because once we got home it was not what we ordered or our daughter wanted.  She tried it and could not eat it so that was a waste of money.    The entire experience was kind of stressful even though the staff is really trying and they are nice.  It just stinks when they miss the mark and cannot deliver when you are there and they cannot deliver on something you order to go.  I don't know if we will give this place another shot, I guess if I can confirm they have updated their menu and have all the food items listed in stock maybe we will give them another chance but for now, it is what it is and its not a place I desire to return to.",

    "text": "When our food was served, I caught myself getting excited and exclaiming, \"WOW!\"  I was off on a weekday, recovering from a turnaround trip to the East Coast. I wanted to a) not cook and b) still eat clean. Whenever this happens, my husband and I usually veer toward Mediterranean/Greek. Wanting to try new places, we headed toward The Fat Greek.   It's located in a large plaza - Sammy's LA Pastrami and Ricardo's can be spotted along the perimeter. You have to drive in toward the Food 4 Less. Parking's a breeze since the lot is quite large.   The interior is bright and clean. The lunch crowd was quite lively - busy enough for me to get excited about all the food gawking but open enough for us to be able to easily find a table.   I ordered the full lunch Greek Salad with chicken; dressing on the side. Now, I realize that salad isn't the ideal thing to order since not much cooking is involved. However, salads and club sandwiches are foods that, when tired or lazy, I'm more than happy to pay to save my the trouble.   My husband got the kefta kabob plate. That, with the salad, caught us both off guard. The food looked so so good. We were instantly impressed. Our excitement grew when we both tried the kabob and were hit with so much flavor. My husband considers it one of his top kefta kabobs.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA&select=lBzw7Sn3DvWQ64nN_FYRkQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Anyway, I've had many a salad and any a Greek salad, but this was just so pretty and so right. The chicken was perfectly cooked and flavorful and everything about it screamed freshness.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA&select=2JEsQPLNZ7McIwMYl_LIgQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Curious, my husband ordered a side of gyro. He expected a piece of two, but was amazed to find this much served for $3. And it was good.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA&select=TLNZyVbHehXFEPACADwGhg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Satisfied by our clean meal, we decided to indulge with Athenian fries. For $3 you get this pile of cheesy goodness piled high and fresh out of the oven.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA&select=Bp6bAPdDZTaWNIN5vlg6Mw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA&select=HSstgqNFolScwsT7SlkIIQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  They're basically Greek fries with the extra step of adding toasty melty goodness with extra cheese and stint under the broiler. Which begs the question: what would Spartan fries look like?  I digress...  You'll find the restaurant isn't fancy, but it's obvious the ownership cares. The interior is clean. The food is done right - simply, well portioned, and presented cleanly.   We spent around $30 with tax and tip and I had leftover chicken to take home. Without my husband's soda, the fries, and the gyro, it's a very reasonably priced healthy lunch that brought us back in the next day for dinner... more on that to come!",

    "text": "I've been to The Fat Greek a few times and I am a fan. It's a great place for lunch.  The foods delicious and reasonably priced. Gyros and sandwiches during lunch went for about $8. And their usually accommodating for groups.  I've had the beef shawerma, the chicken shawerma, and some of the gyros. Everything I've had so far has been really good, seemed fresh and taste delicious. Nothing seemed greasy or over/lacked seasoning, well I'd probably throw hot sauce on it but I love hot sauce. Someone on the table had ordered these fries, I don't know what they were called but it wasn't your usually fries it looked so good, the entire plate was wiped out before I even could try them. I will need to find out what they were and have them next time.  I remember once it was so busy that they gave us a complementary pieces of baklava. Yum that baklava was so good. Layers of flakey yet moist goodness with nuts and honey. If you have a sweet tooth make a stop here just for the baklava.  The interior is kind of mom and pops like or old however you want to call it but there are a lot of seats available, except when it's very busy and there a wait. There's a larger TV hanging on the wall.  It's located in between an Indian/Pakistani restaurant and a Food4Less on Decatur and Flamingo, cause of it's location I sometimes forget it's even there.",

I don't know how in the world they have 4.5 stars Im actually still trying to figure that out.  The food was without a doubt the worst Greek food I have ever had in my life, this including the years I have spent there, all of the places I have had Greek food in the country, etc. The gyro was gross. The meat tasted old and not fresh and had no flavor. The pita was clearly store bought and reheated.   We ordered the pita and tzatziki.  It came with literally 5 of the smallest pieces of pita bread and a bowl of tzatiziki. The tzatiziki was had so much garlic that it made my stomach upset.  It was also very very watery :(.   It took us about an hour to have two gyros and pita. WTF??? All of those things should be just about made and take literally five minutes to assemble.   I will NEVER return and I severely suggest that if you want greek food you find some where else where its more authentic. I would rather eat Arbys gryos than ever go near this gross stuff again.",

They are generous with there amount of food.  My friend order the falafal with gyros....the gyros was excellent. I don't recommend this dish because falafal is made out of bread...other than that, if you love falafal go for it.  Pros: they give you alot of food, very fresh and clean, service is excellent, staff is friendly and attentitve  Con: its in a shitty strip mall  Also they have excellent fresh desert...which i did not try  P.s.

One hour in she called and said they were running behind and it would be 15-20 minutes more. At the TWO HOUR mark and with her not answering calls or texts I called the restaurant.   I said I'm looking for my daughter because I haven't heard from her the lady said oh she is right here we are running behind. I said it has been TWO HOURS! She said sorry I don't know what to tell you. I asked to speak to my daughter and told her to cancel the order and come home. She told the lady who said we have to call Grub Hub to cancel. The lady got back on the phone with me and I said you have got to be kidding right? I thought my daughter had been kidnapped but instead she has been sitting there for TWO HOURS and you can't cancel the order? She said no I don't know what to tell you. I said how much longer will it be she spoke to someone, the cooks l suppose, and they said 15 more minutes. I cannot believe they would allow a customer to wait TWO HOURS and just say I don't know what to tell you, contact Grub Hub. I would contact Grub Hub but my daughter, whose phone is dead, is the one who set up the account. There are any number of ways they could have tried to make this right.  Never again will we order from here...they obviously don't value their customers. Done with Grub Hub too, as this is outlandish. I am obviously very  thankful my daughter wasn't kidnapped.",

First, the staff is great and everyone is smiling and happy. The lady that works there explains anything you have questions to. Super friendly. I can't emphasize how friendly everyone is!! OK, now for the food. My bf got the lamb souvlaki and I got the gyro with Athenian fries. Let's start with the lamb souvlaki. The lamb was good, but not great. It didn't have as much flavor or that pow factor in my mouth. It lacked seasoning, considering I just ate at another Greek competitors. However, the tzatziki sauce was awesome, which I think saved the protein portion of the meal. Without it, it would had been disappointing. The gyro, was good, once again, not great. My bf says the meat is better than the other Greek places, but ehh, I gotta disagree. So, to each there own right? I was excited to try the Athenian  fries. When they came out, the cheese was cold and a bit stale. I expect something along of cheesy fries where the cheese was warm and gooey and melts. I don't think I'll be getting that at all. I should have stuck to regular fries. Maybe that's how they are suppose to be, and I didn't know. We went daring and decided to get the yogurt drink too. Lol, uhhh, she warned us that it was sour and salty. I would like to describe this yogurt drink as followed: sour as if the milk is bad, then add salt to it, and top it off with some unsweetened yogurt. Blend all ingredients. Was it good? Not at all, but I kept drinking it in hopes that it would taste better. It kind of did after awhile, then my brain told me NEIN!! And then, went back to tasting like sour old diapers. The taste for me, was way too exotic for my taste buds. So, overall? Food isn't as great, but honestly, it would have tasted great for the state fair standards.",

    "text": "I love The Fat Greek. A lot of places in Las Vegas will deliver a gyro to your door, but in my experience they're disappointing and often filled with identical ovals of funky lamb-spam.  Not here though. The lamb is legit, the beef is tender, and the tomatoes are fresh and sweet. Flavor-wise this place is awesome, the price is decent, and the service is good.  They will on occasion forget an item in your order. It happens to everyone, right? They won't give you trouble about it or make you jump through hoops. Just let them know and they'll fix it pretty damn quick. Half an hour after calling in a mistake, they had sent me a new order, plus a free dessert (with a little smiley face inside the carton which kinda made my day)  The third-party delivery company they use is fast, friendly, and helpful when something isn't right.  I recommend a gyro (lamb & beef), with souvlaki and Athenian fries on the side. Dolmades and spanikopita too if you're hungry. It's all delicious.",

Overall tasty and not too expensive. We got out of there, 3 people, for just under 50 bucks. With some beer, so pretty decent.  The service was kind of slow. Would try again, if it gets better I will post another review.   I have been to better spots in the past, but this a pretty good gyro for sure. A repeat if I am in the mood for Greek.",

I've returned a few times because I like their chicken kebab plate, but the time before last me and my date were kind of neglected- had to ask for silverware, napkins, asked twice for the same things and then we were kind of rushed out because it was near their closing, they took out glasses and plates and gave us paper and plastic so they could wash the dishes early... The next time I went there a guy behind the counter told me I couldn't eat there with my service dog (which had never been a problem before), then when I called later to complain to a manager because one wasn't available at the time, the manager/owner accused me of lying about the situation and said there was no reason for my call and hung up on me. I'm shocked by how bad their customer service is, I liked their food but won't go there ever again because of how poorly the staff and owner treated me.",

I just wished that there was more hummas and  Tahini Sauce to taste. Overall, it was good/pleasant.  __ Fat Greek Gyros (w/ beef/lamb), $7.79:  I honestly felt that the meat was too seasoned, that it became slightly salty for my palette. The crumbled feta cheese on top sure did not help-- together with the meat, it brought out an overly salty taste to the gryos.   *Note: Add $1.99 for Choice of Rice, Fries, or Greek Salad and 24 oz. Fountain Drink  Although I gave this place only 3 stars, I will be back again. I definitely want to try out the other items on the menu, especially since this place is listed at the top (of the search engine) for Greek cuisine on Yelp.",

The food and service was as good as we remembered.  There was a group of four behind us of cranky people looking to complain to obtain a discount but they are full of baloney.  One word--- yum!  We definitely made a note of this place for our next visit.  We had chicken kabob and gyro plate with Greek wine which they let us sample before we committed to purchase.  They were really busy so we had to drink water from odd glasses (too busy to keep up with dishwashing) -  small problem- tells me they have good food for a local place",

I Asked the waitress if they made the food for the dining in customers before the to go and she didnt have an answer. The pasticcio was very good. The gyro meat is standard. the grilled chicken was tender and flavorful. So the food was good but service was horrible. I guess if you eat in you will get your food faster.",

I've had my share of wonderful Greek food, my husband is Greek and happens to be very good at cooking his mom's Greek dishes. This place was a huge disappointment in every way.  1. Service - Awful. One Russian waiter who did EVERYTHING while an old guy stood around and watched him. I saw another table ask where there food was and he said \"I'm the only one here today and all these people came in at the same time\", no apology, nothing. We sat for 15 minutes before our spanikopita came out. Another 20 minutes until our lunch came. At first we thought - this is what we get for going to a Greek restaurant on Greek Easter BUT this place is run by Russians! So that's not even an excuse. We did notice three other tables with Russian patrons were served much more quickly than us.  2. Food - all lukewarm. Spanikopita was like none other I've had, and not in a good way. Hardly any filling and there was crunchy stuff on the top. It was ok, but it certainly wasn't spanikopita. I had the chicken soulvaki and my husband had the lamb. Both meats were lukewarm, probably bc our waiter was spending too much time socializing with one of the Russian tables and the old guy just stood and watched as our dish got cold. The chicken was completely average, my husbands lamb was ok. The dish came with rice, which was very \"wet\". We each had a side salad. The salad was probably the best part of our meal. It was yummy.  3. Atmosphere - it's in a strip mall with a Food 4 Less so let's just say you should not expect it to have a great atmosphere and it certainly lived up to that expectation.  All in all, as a Vegas local we will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone. It was a very disappointing, strange experience. It was this place or Thai, we should've gone with Thai...",

That's True, I guess I should've specified, but shouldn't she have also clarified, she is the waitress with more knowledge about the menu than I. I guess she was just having a bad day.
