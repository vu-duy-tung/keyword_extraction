My dad and I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and tuna melt. My niece ordered the chicken fingers. The pesto chicken sandwich was just the right portion size and didn't have too much pesto. The ingredients in the tuna melt and pesto chicken sandwich tasted fresh.   We had friendly memorable service! We will be back.",

Service is wonderful and they serve purified ice water which tasted fantastic compared to what I get at other eateries. Also the fresh squeezed orange juice, while a bit pricey, was absolutely delicious.   Lots of organic food offerings, can't be beat for that.  Will return.",

The only hitch I see is after all of the quality fresh ingredient they use, both the burger and omelette had processed cheese. The Chef owner assured us it was a mistake. Chef was proud of 80% of the ingredients being organic and he bakes everything fresh. Soft opening and he wasn't cooking. Training new cook. We will go back, but I will be sure to let them know, no processed cheese.",

    "text": "Came across this restaurant while searching for brunch spots in Las Vegas. I am a huge foodie and I love when restaurants are creative with their dishes because it shows their TLC. Walked in with a group of eleven and were sat promptly. We were celebrating a successful bachelorette & bachelor weekend. The menu isn't large but filled with plenty of choices to satisfy your tummy. One of our group is vegan and she was happy that there was at least one vegan option for her. I personally ordered the Eggs-Quisite Benedict which was beautiful! Only issues I had are my eggs were not poached properly so they had to remake them and there was no avocado like the menu stated. Once that was fixed it was AMAZING! Not many restaurants can get 11 dishes on the table at nearly the same time and Dirty Fork did that with little hiccup. Since we were celebrating the bride and groom to be the cook created a special crepe dessert for the couple to share. Another thing I was happy to hear is that the fruit is cut fresh all day long!   Aside from the food, the place was clean and welcoming. I work in the service so I understand the stress a large party can put on one server who has other tables to tend to and our server did a great job! Management was very kind and helpful and asked us to take a group photo in front of the Dirty Fork wall before we left. I will definitely be back next time I am in Las Vegas!",

I was ready to try it either way. Both burger and fries were flavorful!! I'll be back again when I'm on the westside of town.",

This place had nothing but that. No acknowledgement whatsoever when we walked in. Stood there because the sign says to \"wait to be seated\" when they all just kind of looked at us like we were idiots. Finally got sat and then didn't hear back from our server for another 10+ minutes before she took a drink order. Forgot our drink order after another 10mins and the owner just drops us some water without saying a word. We finally get our orders taken and the server missed almost half our order! We wait patiently for our food and they messed it up! We ordered the North Shore Shrimp. Highly disappointed!!! Had about 5 little overcooked pieces of the shrimp in a pineapples bowl of rice. No where near the shrimps you get in Hawaii's food trucks. I was so disappointed that I almost sent it back- which I regretfully should have. Anyway, they forgot our daughters kids meal and rushed that order. Fries where not cooked throughly. Another disappointment.  Overall, I don't see us coming back here. We were mislead by the Hawaiian food and unfortunately did not get the True aloha spirit with it.",

    "text": "Locally owned and operated, it's another Hawaiian business bolstering the city's claim as the \"9th island.\" The restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Norm's Eggs Cafe. They've done a great job making the interior more inviting with darker woods and turquoise paint to give it more of an island feel. There's a decent sized dining area and also a counter you can sit at that looks into the kitchen.   Their menu isn't very focused. There's some Hawaiian inspired fare that seems to be the main attractions and also shows the most creativity. Then there's some French and American dishes thrown in, along with a breakfast burrito. So, it's a hodgepodge of breakfast and lunch stuff that's probably good for their bottom line, but doesn't really show what they're about or where they want to take this restaurant.  On my first visit, shortly after they opened, I only grabbed a couple pastries. At the time they were outsourcing their pastries and the product was poor with the chocolate croissant soggy and limp and the almond croissant tasting like it was days old.  A second, more recent visit, showed much improvement. First, a thick, biscuit-like scone to start. Followed by their 9th Island French toast. Using a sweet Hawaiian bread, it's more like a dessert, but if you like sweets, you'll love this dish, especially when it's drenched in coconut syrup and guava cream cheese.  This place shows some promise but will have to re-focus their menu and improve their pastries.",

Just now I went and got a bagel and cream cheese and I was not informed that the bagel would have homemade dill cream cheese and when I returned it the chef seemed a little perturbed and took almost 10 minutes to give me the bagel with plain cream cheese.

I've had burgers where there is more bun than burger so I trim off the sides, NOT this one, every bite was a perfect bite with plenty of avocado and all the fixins!! Not to mention the fries!!!

I got the Belgium Waffle with a side of bacon and eggs.  Waffle was nicely platted, crispy, dusted with powdered sugar and a drizzle of syrup.  Very tasty, very good service, and props for the fresh baked goods.  Small critique, since they said they are in a \"soft opening\" so still tweaking things, price for the bacon, eggs and waffle was about  $16 which is over priced compared to comparable restaurants.  Waffle quality was top notch but I hope they offer a eggs and meat combo for only a few a more reasonable price.    Looking forward to going back and trying something else soon.",

It wasn't very busy but for some reason service started out supet slow about 10 minutes before we even had our drink order taken. This instantly had our minds made up not to come back. Then a gentleman from behind the bar came out and handled our drink order (I'm assuming he was the owner) very friendly and personable. Once the food came out we were sold! Avocado Toast with a perfectly poached egg was on point. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place but I was very disappointed with the results.  I stopped by around 1pm with a friend. I had already looked up the menu and Yelp reviews prior to arriving. The place was empty except for people at a few of the two top tables by the windows. We ended up sitting at one of the bigger tables for 4 in the middle. The restaurant was warm. I'm cold natured so I'm figuring it was over 80 in there for me to even notice. All of the tables have the same kind of chairs, hard wooden with decorative designs on the back. They obviously don't want anyone hanging around. My back was killing me after just over an hour in these chairs.   We sat at the table for about 4 minutes before the cook came to give us menus (the waiter was focused on the few couples at the tables on the wall & cleaning dirty tables). The waiter came and took our drink order. I ordered a diet soda. It came in a can with a glass of ice that was melted into half water when presented to me. My friend received water no ice, no straw (she never asked for no ice and wanted a straw). We decided on what to order, a few minutes later we placed our order. I ordered a short stack of pancakes with coconut syrup. My friend ordered 2 scrambled eggs and a bagel(btw- they charge $1 extra for cream cheese on the bagel). While placing our order someone came in to sit at the counter. We waited and waited and waited for our food.  The guy at the counter got his food, ate, and left before we were served even though we ordered first. The cook was walking around, hanging out at the register, and certainly in no rush. It was about 30/40 minutes before we got our food. Finally the cook brings over our food. He drops it off with no silverware. We see him speaking to the waiter at the end of the counter (no customers/no register there, he was doing something by himself). The cook begins rolling some silverware. He brings it back to us 3 minutes after dropping off the food.  I was very disappointed that my item was not was described on the menu. Instead of coconut syrup on the pancakes, it had shredded coconut (which I don't like) and regular maple syrup. Either they are out of the coconut syrup (& didn't mention it) or their menu is written incorrectly. I didn't even feel like trying to get it corrected because it took so long to get this. I ate about a 1/4 of one pancake after scraping off the shredded coconut.   I asked for the check. The waiter brought it and took my debit card. After 10 minutes I had to ask for my card back.  He didn't have it in his hands and I was getting concerned that I saw him return one to someone that gave theirs a couple minutes after I gave mine. He was confused that he hasn't given it back and went looking for it. He returned it to me a couple of minutes later. I wasted $20 on 2 scrambled eggs, a bagel (no cream cheese), a canned soda, & 2 inedible pancakes.  TLDR: This place is over hyped. The service is incompetent in the afternoon. The menu doesn't match what you get. Waste of time and money.",

It was actually really empty on a Saturday morning at 11:00am.  It doesn't matter but we got here and I wanted to try the dishes they are known for so I ordered their Dirty Fork Breakfast.  The kids had the blueberry pancake and my husband ordered their turkey sandwich.   Blueberry pancake: My kids didn't like the blueberries.  That was my fault in ordering it.  They said that the blueberry in the pancake tasted funny.  So, I tried it.  It was fine. I guess the kids don't like Blueberry?  My Dirty Fork Breakfast was AWESOME!   My son took the french toast bread and my daughters took the strawberry and eggs. I was left with some fried chicken.    My husbands turkey sandwich:  The sandwich was suppose to have sprouts but it didn't come with any. He also said that the turkey was too thin compared to what you'd get at other diners. So he didn't like his sandwich but he was so hungry he ate the whole thing.   Service: AMAZING.  But then again, we were the only ones in the restaurant. The lady was super nice and came back many times to help us out. I wished there were more people in there.    It's not bad. I am just surprised nobody was there.",

The girl on phone said \"well we are located off Durango/spring mtn\".  She pretty much made it clear that they are too far and that our order was not a priority. If you quote us a wait time of an hour and we are Still patient enough to wait for the order, then you better be kidding our A_ _!!!!! We called support (Grub Hub) and they called the restaurant for us and all they said was \"we were busy\". Ehhhhh... WRONG ANSWER!! Never say \"you are too busy\" for a customer. Especially a first timer. Here's the best part....I asked what the solution was for this and all grub hub could say is \"we can give you a $5 off credit\". AWESOME!!!!!!! So in conclusion, we will NEVER order from this restaurant again, because of the wait and now our food is probably cold. And thanks Grub hub for the $5off.....such a JOKE.",

Ok first off this review may a bit basis since I know the owner and she's a good friend. Anyways so we came here for lunch met up with other Yelpers that happened to be in Vegas this same weekend. The place is not huge there are a good amount of tables. Service was great depending on how crowded it is and what food you order it could take a while. The menu has a lot of choices from Breakfast and lunch. They are opened till about 3pm and only serve breakfast and lunch dishes. You can take out as well. I got the big Island breakfast which is Portuguese sausage, two eggs served you way and rice. It was yummy. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes as well. Overall a great breakfast spot if you want that Hawaiian style type breakfast I recommend stopping by. They do get packed in the morning hours afternoon like after 12:45pm gets less busy. I'd come back for sure.",

I've sampled their Sunrise Sammy, Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and their pastries. I can say I was not displeased at all by any of my menu suggestions. Both main dishes were very tasty and fulfilling. I could not finish either one of them. And on both occasions my server was very pleasant and observant. The costs to dine here is just as laid back as the atmosphere.  They have tables outside as well if you wanted to do some street watching. Its nice to see local businesses offer delicious food and reasonable prices. They also Hawaiian sun drinks, just FYI for all the 9th islanders. Their sodas are by the can.",

The French toast was good but nothing to brag about it, not to mention that there wasn't any guava cream cheese on it like the menu advertises.   The pictures really made me want to come in and unfortunately I most likely won't be coming back.   On to the next food venture!",

I feel really bad putting the dirty fork on blast but I believe it's the right thing to do to ensure no one gets any food born illnesses from cross contamination or worse. Today I decided to visit the Dirty Fork because of the great reviews and I love trying new places in town. I immediately noticed the disarray of the kitchen and how exposed it was as it is in the front of the house . I tried to overlook it and just enjoy myself however as time went on I became more and more upset with what I was seeing. The cooks were not using proper tools or gloves when handling eggs, then going over to fix a salad or top off breakfast items with fruit etc. servers were making some of the items without wearing gloves or using cutting boards on surfaces that had leftover food, eggs and remnants from previous items being prepared . What frustrated me the most was watching a woman cut oranges on the filthy counter top with no gloves and then pressing them to make fresh juice. There is no doubt in my mind that these oranges were not washed beforehand and they 100% came in contact with raw food items such as eggs . On top of it all there were numerous people complaining around us which just created a negative atmosphere . In terms of the food it was mediocre at best . The French toast was however a total sham . They charge $11.95 for simply the toast and then charge $2 for \"fresh fruit\" that was man handled with no gloves or tools . Needless to say I won't be returning and highly suggest that they get their Sh*t together before they end up on dirty dining !",

Our waitress Maggie introduced us to the whole staff when we sat down and the food is amazing!   Lots of choices, super reasonable, and yay for healthy choices too! You can go the other way. Hawaii fried rice, big mouth burgers, amazing chocolate hazelnut croissants, but you don't have to. I went down the middle. I had these great scratch buttermilk light fluffy coconut pancakes with passion fruit syrup on the side, a fresh fruit bowl and turkey bacon. You have to get those pancakes. I wanted the big stack, but what I ordered was too much to make it through. Btw, I did get the hazelnut croissants to go. So good!",

Marco and Jose were the chefs and our waitress was Maggi. Service was good, place is cute and we had leftovers! Only downside for todays visit no Musabi for the hubby and they do not redeem Groupons on the weekends. However, because I checked in on Yelp they gave me a free soda! Sodas are in cans by the way and that is how I prefer them to be served! That way you always know they are carbonated! We will be back and will tell all our friends!",

    "text": "The food was actually fantastic and had incredibly generous portions, but considering that we were there at 10 am on a Sunday morning and this is a breakfast joint, we predict it won't be around for long. And maybe that's a good thing -- although I hate to say it because the service was great and the food was SUPER delicious (although kind of pricey which might explain why it was kind of slow during prime brunch time).   One disturbing thing was that there are several pineapples prominently displayed over the glass cooler, but they are clearly drying out and going bad (the leaves are brown and crispy). This tells me that they are not turning their stock quickly enough.   Another disturbing thing was that I could see the reach in glass cooler case door was kept open the entire time (probably 80 minutes) we were there -- this is also where they store the eggs for breakfast, so basically the eggs might as well be sitting out on the counter, as there is no way that those eggs are being kept at the proper temperature if typical operating procedure is to keep the reach in cooler door open all the time. During the time we were there, I saw both employees reaching into the cooler to take things out and not shutting the door, so this tells me that this is their normal habit. Even more disturbing is that there were a ton of pastries in that cooler that were not covered and several flies buzzing around the restaurant, which is a signal that there's a problem somewhere back of house too.",

It was still hot (I peeked and the thermostat read 78 degrees,) and it still smelled like wet rag! The pastries didn't look too appetizing so I passed on that, but I did order their brunch special of salmon wrapped lettuce with mushrooms and other crap that didn't seem to go together. I must say, the best part of my meal was  the poached egg that was done perfectly and the whiff of air when we left. I saw my friends burger and he did not finish it, so I assumed it wasn't worth $13 as I know he is a cheap guy. The pancakes were pretty mediocre too, with some fancy coconut dressing. This place is not as great as it appears to be and I wish the owners do something about that smell! The other best thing about this place was their coffee, it was smooth and subtle. Like how coffee should be. Kudos on that.",

Saw a worker in the kitchen pull out his phone multiple times  5.) Eggs were HORRIBLE (not an understatement, it tasted like airline food)  6.)

    "text": "Went here after months of driving by and looking at the menu online. It's around the corner from me so finally decided to stop by on a random day off. I was really excited to try the Dirty Fork Lunch Special with the prosciutto wrapped arugula which is what I have been seeing on the YELP menu and the Eat 24 menu but when I got there they had changed it to salmon. I didn't even notice the change on their menu and proceeded to show the Yelp and Eat 24 menu to everyone working there because after months of anticipation I was disappointed. Well much to my surprise they brought me a complimentary plate of prosciutto to make up for the confusion. Apparently they changed their menu but Yelp and Eat 24 hadn't had updated it yet. I admit I was a tad bit dramatic about the issue but I take my food seriously lol. The Lunch Special was amazing both ways. Salmon and prosciutto. I loved the decorations and waiter was very good. I'll definitely be back to try the French toast and pancakes! Don't understand the negative reviews. The restaurant was charming and everyone was very friendly!!",

I was amazed that there was only 1 Chef cooking for the entire restaurant he got everything out within 15-20mins for us! I wouldn't really crave anything at this place I may or may not be back because nothing really wowed me.  All in all this place was good.",

But I said no cause I was so hungry. She told the cook. But he argue with her that it was medium. He is wrong. The cook needs a lot more training. I'm giving you 3 stars.

They have Turkish coffee which is ! Everything left us feeling light but full. Not in an overwhelming way I which you want to nap or anything. We came again this morning and decided to get lunch. We got the fancy turkey sammy and the dirty fork burger. The turkey sandwich was amazing. It has pesto, avocado, onion, sprouts, and a super delicious sauce. I got fries as the side and they were a perfect type of crispy. The dirty fork was huge but also amazing. I don't even know what else to say besides amazing.",

I got anything Hawaiian style on the menu and let's just say not Hawaiian... the hamburger patty on the local Mocho was dry almost like cardboard with no flavor. My ninth island French toast came with syrup already on it and there was hardly any as well as no butter it was just bread dipped in egg... no cinnamon in there or even vanilla extract just a quick dip the center of the French toast was still just plain old bread. And the fried rice... When you pay $11 for a fried rice and it's a literally 1 scoop of rice with shoyu chunks of spam and lima beans it's extremely disappointing... the only thing Hawaiian about this place is the pineapple they have on the counter when you walk in... not a single person in the staff had a smile on their face for the 2 hours I was in there. Maybe spend some time in Hawaii before you name things on your menu \" Hawaiian \" ... won't be going back",

It was similar to the French croque madame with a few twists. The egg on top was cooked perfectly. It had a Swiss cheese instead of the traditional white sauce. There was also Dijon mustard which gave it a nice tang. The micro green salad included was fresh, with a multitude of dressing options. The island pancakes were fluffy and light. I tried their house made guava syrup, and it was excellent! It was light and sweet. Also there was a side menu which included some other dishes, like Loco Moco. I did try the Portuguese sausage that was on that menu. They definitely need to add that to their regular menu. It had a great texture that was soft and the meat was fresh and seasoned well. I definitely recommend coming here for a great breakfast that is upscale from your standard diner!",

The cooks are out in the open & you can see the kitchen and the serving area, so you know exactly how long your food sits & waits once it is plated. Saturday afternoon, not too busy, & we were seated immediately. We ordered both breakfast and lunch items. The bacon was extra crispy. Burgers cooked well. Fries had an added herb/spice that made them savory over salty. Sadly, as we went to pay the owner elected to charge a \"Groupon tax\" after the fact. We use Groupon to test out a lot of new restaurants and we've never had to pay this fee. We contacted Groupon & they handled it for us, but it kinda spoiled the meal to argue with the manager over this random fee. Hopefully, they will fix this for their future customers.",

Chicken cooked to perfection and I really loved the addition of sunflower seeds for texture and taste. I also had the Spam Musubi and it was the best thing I've eaten all week  great job!

I dunno, again- too much. Hard to get a complete bite. I like my sandwiches stable. I like them balanced. short stack of island pancakes: GREAT. all the syrups were yummy. They were fluffy, light, absolutely delicious.  Here's the bottom line- go. Try it. Make up your own mind. Support small businesses. My take is just that- mine.  (ATTN OWNER!!!)Last BUT NOT LEAST- get rid of the elevator music please. I think that was the worst. Waited quite a while for our food and the music in the background just made it feel like I was in a doctors office. Play some chill good vibe island sounds. Isn't that your \"thing\"?? Again- confused.",

We enjoyed: . 9th Island French Toast - Friends, you ain't gonna buy this Hawaiian bread at Walmart! The bread is shipped from Hawaii and turned into slices of heaven! Served with guava cream cheese and coconut syrup, my wife and I fought over the last piece! . What The Fork Omelette - Bell Peppers, sweet onions, mushrooms, and Swiss cheese, topped with avocado and served with a side of organic greens. Light, fluffy, flavorful and delicious!  A word about the service: From the time we came in, sat down, ordered, and was served, 12 minutes. 12. It felt like 2. Not only that everybody in the place, including the staff, is smiling and enjoying themselves. Gotta love it!",

    "text": "2 for 2 this weekend, and this why we are creatures of habit. Both new places we tried was a bust! We decided to try Dirty Fork as their IG looks promising, big mistake on my end as normally I peruse their yelp page prior to going somewhere new. I know I know rookie move. I should've read Lavi's review.   It started out great as there was no wait. The server came promptly to take our drink orders. You ran out of Hawaiian Sun? Okay fine give me coffee instead. I mentioned I had a groupon, she said nope only on weekdays. My bad I should've checked. I turned to my husband to confirm if it was just me or does the server have a really bad attitude, he said no it's not just your imagination. Moving on.   Food was ordered: 2 Big island breakfast which consisted of Portuguese sausage, eggs and for $2 more Hawaiian fried rice. I ordered the Jade pancakes full stack and asked for both the lilikoi and coconut syrup. Son had the breakfast special and daughter had strawberry Nutella crepes. When the food came they had regular rice for my husband and only had the coconut syrup for me. I mentioned it to the older gentleman that dropped off our food and I swear to God he interrupted me mid sentence and said WAIT! Wait what?!?!? Wtf! did you just seriously tell me wait and walked away?!?!? WOW! I'm in no way confrontational but it took a lot in me to not say something. Soon enough someone dropped off the so called fried rice with no apology or nothing. Ummm I don't know where they've had Hawaiian fried rice coz that was not it, advertised as having spam too and that was not spam! I've been eating spam my whole life, I would know. So the girl server comes back and I informed her I didn't get my Lilikoi syrup, and my son told me she straight up rolled her eyes! The pancakes were so dry and dense. At this point I've lost my appetite and stopped eating altogether. The Portuguese sausage was extra extra crispy which translates to barely edible.   Needless to say we will not be back. I'm sorry but the management need to retrain their people and emphasize ALOHA. Service was abysmal. Nothing worst than going to a restaurant and be completely disappointed with the service and the food. Ummmm NO!!!!",

Phenomenal food, generous portions, impeccable plating, off-the-charts customer service, gorgeous coffee and a reasonable price point.   I've eaten here twice, and will be back many more times. When you're at the Dirty Fork, you feel like family. Do yourself a favor and get the hot coffee - it's not your typical diner coffee. A turkish roast with phenomenal mouth-feel, each sip is a buttery treat for your taste buds.   The avocado toast will BLOW YOU AWAY with smoked salmon, fresh fruit, greek yogurt, sunflower seeds and the most perfectly poached eggs I've ever encountered. I didn't want this meal to end.   The french toast is a feast, I took half of mine home! French toasted Hawaiian sweet bread topped with scrambled eggs, chicken tender nuggets, fresh sweet strawberries, and fresh whipped cream. Holy moly.   My husband says the burger was one of the best in Vegas, and the fatty burrito was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> - his words, not mine.   I'm super stoked the Dirty Fork followed me on Instagram one day (rocksteady81) because after cruising through their feed, we headed immediately down to check them out :)",

    "text": "Came here on Thursday with a girlfriend on our first day here in Vegas because we were craving avocado roasts and the reviews on Yelp looked promising. And boy were the reviews correct. Just looking at the presentation alone of the poached eggs, the fruit, and, of course the star of the show, the toast with sliced avocado and smoked salmon. The best way to eat this is to take a poached egg as carefully as you can and put it on top of the toast and then break the yolk into the salmon and avocado. This really hit the spot. I enjoyed every bite and was so full after. The owner was so nice and gave us flyers for a free drink with an entree purchase to come back. I was so pleased with both the food and the warmth of the service that we both decided to come back again during our short trip.   We came by again on out last day (Sunday) and my friend got the Eggs Benedict instead and I got the same Vegas Style Avo toast. There was a little mishap in the kitchen so our food was late but it was still worth the wait - the food was amazing. The owners felt so bad that they have us a small percentage off our bill for the food being late. All in all, I enjoyed my time and if I'm ever in the Vegas area again I will be checking out this place!",

Whatever the reasoning was, I was hungry and tried it out.   From the get-go, I had a feeling that things were not gonna go right. First, the pluses....the place was clean, tables were cleared, and restrooms were being up-kept. Now, the minuses....like I said before, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt. The service was slow, no one came over to ask if we needed any more water, seeing that our clear water bottle was empty. And, the food took a little longer than anticipated.   Okay, on to the food. First Up, the Spam Musubi! I know that there are different ways that people make it, but why would you drench the bottom of the plate with Olive Oil, with the Spam Musubi on top! I know they may try to make it fancy looking, just little drops of the oil around the plate would have sufficed! Not all on the bottom of the plate. Next was the Korean Fried Chicken Wings. Which was not....It was just fried chicken on a bed of little romaine lettuce leaves. You DO NOT use Shoyu, or Soy Sauce as the sauce for the Korean Fried Chicken Wings. You use Korean BBQ Sauce!   Maybe I'll give it another try next time, but I was not impressed with this trip today!",

This is a solid choice for your 'breakfasty' cravings.  A clean place with a solid and pleasant design. The display counter for pastries is fun to look at and is enticing. The only down-side we experienced was that the floor was a bit greasy and therefore, a bit slippery.  Believe it or not, my wife claims that she has smelled the fish n chips as she passed by. And while they don't have bottles of vinegar (eh...packets), they do have multiple pieces (not just one big piece-yuck) and nicely done chips. Instead of paying $30 a plate on the strip for a decent plate of fish n chips...come here. I will return for this dish.  There are many menu options that sound tempting and are interestingly named). We went with the salmon/mushroom/ eggs/garlic sauce on toast. Perfectly portioned for such a decadently rich dish. Another one worth a repeat.  The people are  nice here and its a very relaxed atmosphere. We will happily return.",

    "text": "OVER PRICED, SUB PAR SERVICE, SNOBBY OWNER, UNFAIR SERVICE CHARGE  I went to Dirty Fork with family for brunch on a recommendation.  Honestly, I was just not impressed.  Not even a little bit.  The food was just okay - nothing to write home about.  And for what it is, it was too expensive.  I had a Caesar salad with no chicken and it was $10.25.  A small glass of orange juice was $5.00 and a small glass of milk was $3.00.    The service was barely acceptable.  Our waitress was very scatter-brained.  I kid you not, she got distracted mid-pour (refilling my coffee) and walked away.  Because she had to go to the kitchen to grab food to deliver to a different table.  She also never came back to finish refilling my coffee.    At some point, the restaurant owner came over to our table to say hello.  But her demeanor was very snobby.  It's hard to describe.  But I did not get any warm-and-fuzzies from the interaction.    Also, they charge an automatic 20% service charge.  TWENTY PERCENT!!!  We had a large party, so I understand the automatic gratuity.  BUT, most restaurants charge between 15 - 18% gratuity for large parties.  They are pretty brazen to charge 20%, and for BRUNCH no less!  PLUS, they did not inform in any way, shape, or form in regards to the automatic gratuity.  Normally, restaurants would either post the policy somewhere visible inside the establishment or it would be printed on the menu.  NOPE.  They just happily slapped me with the 20% service charge and after providing me with crappy service.  I called the restaurant and made a complaint later on that day because I was really unhappy with the experience.  The person that answered the phone took down my information and said the owner would give us a call back to resolve our inquiry.  SHE NEVER CALLED ME BACK.  BOTTOM LINE:  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",

The restaurant is lovely, adorned with hand blown lamps and ornaments, stained concrete floors, and corrugated steel.   They play nice, classical piano music but distractingly, they also have a flat screen television on the wall showing close up video shots of food being cooked. The visuals are fine but the constant white noise of the sizzling emanating from the television, and competing with the Muzak, is annoying.    Service: 1 (and that's being generous).   The hostess sat us under the annoying sizzle and we couldn't hear ourselves talk, so we asked to move tables.   As I read the menu, the server plopped my cup of coffee right in front of my face, on top of the menu, we instead of next to me. It was rude and unprofessional.    When our food arrived, the same server said, \"Your server will bring you your condiments.\"  Forget the confusion over who our server actually was, to let our food grow cold while they brought us basics like salt and pepper was unacceptable. Why aren't those things on the table already, or brought in advance?  I had to get up and ask for those items.   After the food was brought to us, no one checked on us again. It wasn't until after I paid for my food that I was offered a refill on my coffee.   Oddly, they also have a tip jar for the kitchen staff. I tipped them because they deserve it. The jar is probably there because the back of the house knows that if they're splitting tips with the front of the house, they'll likely get very little dto the poor service.   I'd probably try this place again because of the exceptional food. I only hope they get their service act together.",

    "text": "AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS.   Well we literally just got up and left, right now. Like 8 minutes ago.   Walked in on a Sunday morning, 1 group in front of us the waitress tells them to go seat themselves and we do the same. The place has 3 tables already seated and then us and another group. The waitress tells us a few times it'll be a minute, no problem we say. At least 10 minutes go by while she is running around trying to figure out what to do, and a couple walks in and goes to the bar to sit down, assuming they are regulars based on what ends up happening.   Another server comes in for his shift (I've seen him be the main server multiple times by himself, this place always operates with 1 maybe 2 staff....)   He waltzes in and goes behind the counter and starts to chit chat meanwhile there is 2 tables we are a 4 top the other table is a 5 top, without drinks and it's been 15 minutes. Literally.   He says something to the couple at the bar and I QUOTE.....\"screw those people they can wait\" multiple times to the couple, as he waves towards our tables in the dining area. Loud and proud. I'm assuming the couple said \"are you sure??\" As he pours them their drinks (which we didn't even get yet....15 minutes in.) What an ASSHOLE. So instead of making a scene we just look at each other and get up and on our way down the street to PEGS AND EGGS. Just pulling up the place doesn't have an empty seat in the joint which is promising. I'd rather wait in a full establishment than wait in a place that has 4 tables and doesn't know what the hell to do.   The only reason this place is still in business is because it has some family relation to the landlord. Otherwise this place is a total shithole service wise and will surely fail.   With 10 breakfast places in 3 square miles from this location you have 2 things that make you distinguishable.....1- customer service which this place is a 0/10 and 2- food which couldn't tell you since #1 matters more than 2.   Avoid.",

She very rudely told me that I can not substitute fried rice and that it was a way bigger charge.  I showed her the menu and specifically where it said $2 upcharge for fried rice.

We ordered a sprite and iced latte and waters to drink. We got an acai bowl, French toast, pancakes and tea sandwich. The acai bowl was alright, it wasn't as sweet as we hoped but still good. The French toast with fruit was tasty. The pancakes were a little on the dry side but huge portion. The tea sandwich came with tiramisu and macaroons. The spread on the sandwich we good, the tiramisu would've been better if it weren't so dry. Oh and fries which were awesome with ranch! The fries saved the rating! They were nice and crispy. Good thing we had a groupon because the bill was $60 and we didn't even have meat. It was nice to try someplace different. It's not close to home so we probably won't be back for awhile.",

This place is good for breakfast or lunch or if you're in the mood for something sweet, they have macaroons, cheesecake, or croissants and a little more.   I came here on a Saturday morning around 8:30, no wait, no crowd. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and unfortunately hated it, the mayonnaise (or what lever spread) inside the sandwich completely ruined the taste of the sandwich. I appreciate the organic and turkey bacon options available however. It's a little pricey overall.   My neighbors French toast looked amazing and for that I might come again. The staff was friendly and served us well.",

The servers were nice enough to bring me a menu as I sat outside with my pup.  Honestly all the options sounded so good, it was difficult to choose.      The server KJ brought out a carafe of water, which tasted great! Not that vegas water flavor that I usually decline to drink.  I also started with a glass of orange juice, only because it is fresh! I usually dislike OJ, the one they've got here is delicious and frothy.    Burger with avocado and fries- Really exceeded my expectations. The bread reminds me of something from shake shack. So good! It's probably the first time I did not need to add any ranch.  The avocado was saucy enough on its own that the burger needed nothing extra.  The fries!! Such a nice crunch on the outside, super good all by itself. I can't think of where I've had this texture of fries before. Definitely stands out from other places.    Lunch special- took a bite from my girlfriend's plate. If you are looking for something light it's a great option!   It has salmon, arugula, mushrooms, pico de gallo, with a poached egg the yolk just oozing.  You can tell the thought they put into this menu.  Everything is so yummy!  I thought I'd have a super quick and casual lunch. I surprising enjoyed my afternoon here and decided to stay a little longer.   KJ told me about their afternoon tea offering.  Which I can't wait to try next time!  I didn't have much space so I opted for a cup of tea and macaroons. They were just the right amount of sweet to finish off my meal.   I'm looking forward to making this my social spot.  Afternoon tea is already on my schedule!",

Ordered the omelette and my bf ordered the steak and eggs. It was a little overpriced for the quality and amount of food you get. The reason I gave it two stars was due to the slow service. The place was not busy but it took quite a long time for everything. Then we brought the check up to the cashier thinking it would be faster, but it took over 20mins to process the payment for the group in front of us. That was pretty frustrating. I'm not sure if I'd come back to this place anytime soon.",

I order north sore special priced 13.50. I ordered that one coz I saw pic in instagram and it looks delicious but when my food arrived quantity was so little. 5-6 shrimp, 1 tbs of rice and 1 Tbs of pasta salad. I returned home still hungry that day not happy at all. My food was nothing close to the pic they posted in instagram. Huge disappointment.!we going to think twice to go back to this restaurant.

    "text": "Came here with my mom for lunch after she received a DM on instagram from someone at Dirty Fork asking for us to come try the food (and offered a discount). My mom was interested after seeing their Instagram photos so we came in. As soon as we walked in, we weren't acknowledged at all and were standing awkwardly behind a table of seated guests. Two employees looked at us but said nothing; one of them even walked right in front of us but still said nothing.   Finally, we were acknowledged by someone at the cash register. She said it would be a few minutes until we were seated. There were only a handful of tables taken so we were confused as to why we had to wait when there were so many tables that weren't taken. Turns out, no one thought it'd be a good idea to clear and clean the tables after patrons left. Literally every table was still full of used plates and cups! Then one of the employees tried seating us at one of these tables when I noticed there was a table literally right next to the door that was clean so we told her we'd rather sit there than at a dirty table. She sat us down and then walked away. We didn't even get to place our drink order for almost 5 minutes because she took so long to come back to us.  After we were finally able to place our food and drink order, we got our drinks pretty quickly (I mean, it was a latte and orange juice). I was a bit confused because she placed our drinks down and left without asking if I wanted sugar (which is typical since some people like to put sugar in their lattes). I took a sip anyway and it was SWEET. I like my lattes sweet so I enjoyed it but for those who prefer a latte, well, to taste like a latte, this is not what you'd expect. I think they should have removed the sweetness factor and give patrons the option to sweeten it to their preference because not everyone expects their lattes to come pre-sweetened. Or, they should have asked if I wanted it pre-sweetened or not.   Our meals didn't create any sparks, so nothing to particularly rave about. We weren't happy with the lack of cleanliness and desire to clean up the tables after being used, the extremely slow and lackluster customer service, and food that didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps it was an off day, but the three things I just mentioned shouldn't happen anyway.",

My friend had the fatty burrito and I had the breakfast special with a side of Hawaiian rice. I feel the waitress was very accommodating  to all our requests . Everything came out delicious. My friend had a coupon for free coffee and when I checked in on Yelp we got a free soda, they honored both. I almost got some pastries to go but I was so full. The service was better-than- reviewed and my coffee never went empty. The waitress checked on us often. There was no wait to sit down, it was actually kind of dead inside. The only downside are the prices, they are a little higher than I expected but the flavor makes up for the price. If you are on the side of town I suggest giving them a try.",

We were the 4th 2-person table, with 2 at the bar, and a table with 7 people. Considering that Jodi was the cashier, the server, and the busser,  hopefully people can see it for what it is, a small eatery in a cut throat industry with a small profit margin, and give some consideration to the slightly slower service. It was very slight, 20 minutes from when we were seated to when the food arrived.   Bottom line, coffee was strong, our Breakfast Special was plated nicely with a lot of food, and not expensive at all. The chicken was quite juicy, as breastmeat aren't usually.  My 9th island french toast was delicious with yummy guava cream cheese, I wished there were a little more of it. I added the fresh fruit for an additional $2, which included. Pineapple, blueberries, and strawberries. The side of hashbrowns were cooked perfectly, crispy brown on the outside.",

Being Hawaiian it was nice to see that.  I ordered their 9th Island french toast.  Which was yummy made with sweet bread & topped w/fresh fruit serves with tropical butter & syrup.  We also ordered the 9th Island fried rice (which had spam).  It was all yummy & fresh.  I would definitely try this place again.  FYI ot is a bit of a drive from the strip.",

We ordered food to-go (smoked salmon eggs benedict / 9th island french toast) and were pleasantly surprised to find both looking still very appetizing and thoughtfully arranged even in take-away containers.   My order of the french toast was fluffy and delicious and the portion size was definitely hefty (I ate one slice and shared the other two with family). My only complaint was that my order seemed to be missing the guava cream cheese... I was really looking forward to trying it! But other than that, the meal overall was a lovely treat :)  Their bakery and treats display at the counter threw me off a little, too. I wanted to order additional baked goods (they were clearly displayed with price tags), but was told the ones I wanted were \"display only\". I didn't mind it too much, but was just baffled as to why they would leave them in the case with their prices presented as if to sell when they weren't available... it made me feel a little foolishly baited, haha.  I can't say how the eggs benedicts tasted as it wasn't my order, but my brother seemed to enjoy it. All in all a positive first impression with Dirty Fork.",

The waitress did ask if I wanted to a new one but since I had to sit and wait for 20 mins, I declined the offer. The waitress initially told us that our checks would be split. When it came time to pay for our food (yes, I had to pay for my plate even though I no longer wanted it) the waitress was not eager to split the checks. According to other reviews, this place was great. Based on our experience, all of us will not be back to dine here.Not impressed",

The atmosphere feels like like a French cafe The food is an incredible mix of sweet and savory in the best way.   We've always seen it many times online and finally decided to make the trip.   We were seated immediately and I ordered a coffee  and the Chocolate Croissant  The coffee was so delicious, and the croissant was warm and covered with a rich chocolate sauce. What an incredible way to start off the meal.   I also ordered the Beach Day Spam Musubi and it was so beautifully plated, freshly made, and so big!  Incredibly delicious and smelled like the sea.  We were so impressed right away and next thing we knew our entrees were out in front of us. Rod had ordered the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and I decided to try the Vegas Style Avocado Toast.   The Dirty Fork Breakfast Special: French Toast made with Hawaiian sweet toast, eggs, Fried chicken pieces  strawberry  , and whipped cream. So delicious! Rod and I both loved the flavor, it was big enough for two people to share!   Vegas Style Avocado Toast: Multigrain Toast with Avocado  topped with tossed greens, delicious salmon, and a salsa and garnished with sunflower seeds  with two poached eggs on the side. (So worth not owning a home )   The only downside is that the table wasn't big enough for all the food lol!  You need to try this place! Period!",

My only issue was the cross-contamination that I saw, it bothered me because I actually work in the food industry so I didn't know how to feel about it. I saw a pot of raw eggs stirred up for omelettes sitting in the pastry case broadcasting all the delicious pastries WITH THE CARTON OF EGGS NEXT TO the pastries!! You cant put cooked items next to raw eggs, cross-contamination. I took photos  to show proof and I hope the owner gets on the workers cleanliness and organization skills a bit more especially FOOD SAFETY!",

Ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, loco moco, avocado toast, and the Hawaiian pancakes. Orange juice was great and fresh but a bit pricey. The loco moco was good but the avocado toast and pancakes were just mediocre. The pancakes came with guava syrup but I could've sworn it was just regular syrup.",

We also requested to put fried chicken on the side instead of combining into our toast ( Breakfast special).   As we shared our dishes, we got chances to try a bit of everything. So, it's weird to say but we actually like the side dishes than the main entrees we ordered!!! Toasts that were in the Breakfast special was too sweet and the fried chicken was dry and lack of flavour. Sunrise Sammy, which is a croissant stuffed with bacon, egg and cheddar, was very dry and not warm. Hash browns were the only dish we enjoyed eating...   Staff were not very attentive and helpful. We had to wave a lot of time before they could spot us, which was an unpleasant experience.",

I ordered my son a fruit cup with a butter croissant. I don't mind paying $5 for a fruit cup as long as the quality of the fruit is worth it, in this case it definitely wasn't. Fruit was soggy and didn't seem so fresh. The croissant wasn't that great either. I would've rather had a croissant from Starbucks.   I had the Hawaiian style fried rice (I think that's what it was called) for about $11, and I was expecting a huge portion for that price. But no, it was small and the rice was kind of hard. Didn't care for it. The mac salad was also unusual, I didn't like it either. We also got the Loco Moco, which was kind of bland.   The service was HORRIBLE. We had a good start when we came in, there was a guy with glasses, he was nice. But nobody came to refill our coffees, til we asked. If we didn't ask, I'm pretty sure nobody would've came. Nobody came to check on us to see how we were doing, literally not even once. I made my boyfriend go up and pay for our meal because I knew nobody was gonna come to ask us if we wanted the check. The man with the black shirt that showed his stomach hanging out and the beard, dropped off our food and he did not look happy to be there lol. I was watching him interact with the table sitting in front of us and he looked like he hated his job, I thought it was pretty funny that he had such a crappy attitude.   Needless to say, we left a really bad tip. And I probably won't ever come back. The only thing I really cared for was the coffee.",

I ordered a caprese sandwich which I have had many many other places.  I ate about 1/4 of the sandwich but could not continue as my cheese spelled like fish. Not just a slight smell but a very strong smell.  Since when does mozzeralla smell like fish? I told the server that about my sandwich and she took it and smelled it confirming what I smelled. The cook denied smelling any fish of course.  Scary huh? The server apologized, offered discounts, and replaced my meal with a strawberry/banana crepes which was good.",

We decided on the brie with apple and fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, and prosciutto and marcaspone.  Everyone of those choices were very tasty.  We also split the petit bruerre pannini, grilled chicken.  Again, awesome meal!  The freshly squeezed orange juice was the best and after lunch we shared a connoli which was on point (crispy shell!) and I had a cappuccino.  Excellent all the way around!!!  We will return on our next trip to Vegas.  I definitely recommend!!!!",

My friend ordered the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and she really liked it. I had a bite of it and I really liked the fried chicken on the french toast with the strawberries. Only issue I had with it was it is a tad pricey for being a breakfast/lunch place.",

If you are looking for a light breakfast or lunch item it is a good choice. It is just enough food to fill you up. My friend had the \"Im Easy\" with vegan sausage. I tried her sausage and it was my favorite part food item I had there. They also gave a Hawaiian style breakfast menu. I will give that a try next time. I do think the place needs more decorations on the inside. The ambiance is major reason why I like to eat out.  I will come back here for sure.",

They make a mean cappuccino and their bakery case was full of delicious looking pastries, including a variety of fresh croissants.  My hubby had a burger. It's was really tasty with a special sauce that set it apart from the usual. It was fresh and presented beautifully. I had a BLT which was also very good. Both entrees came with super crispy fries.  While we sat drinking our coffees the owner struck up a conversation with us. Although this place is new, his experience in the restaurant business is not and it shows. He bent over backwards to make sure we had a pleasant experience from beginning to end. He told us he wants to start dinner service soon and that the restaurant will also be available for private events. I really enjoyed the hospitality and look forward to returning.",

    "text": "In my book, the company EAT 24 is mostly at fault.  But when you use a third party to deliver your food, the experience should be somewhat carried over.  Now I never ate here before. And i still haven't.  I ordered my food today at 1pm for delivery.  The app EAT 24 said the food would be picked up and out for delivery 10-30 min after food was ready.  My food was not delivered until 4pm.  By then i had to go to work and get food elsewhere.   It was quite upsetting.  When the food finally came, the delivery guy made it seem like because my roommate received the food 3 hours later all was forgiven.  I ordered food with enough time to have it prepped, delivered, and eaten. The food arrived inedible, old, and soggy. My roomie ended up receiving 3 hour old breakfast burritos and pancakes that were held in a sweat box of a person's car, who has no business doing deliveries.   Just because you have a car and a license doesn't mean you are qualified to deliver food or drive in a city you don't know well.  And because of this person's careless and disrespectful ways.  I am harshly reviewing EAT 24 and the Dirty Fork.  If you choose to have people deliver your food, better have them know the area. I spent 24$ plus tip and received a headache, and no food before work and i had to settle on fast food instead. By the time i could follow up.  We were promised 30% off but a full refund is what i am asking for from someone.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, we won't be back. Two of three times we've dined here, the service has been horrendous. The menu here is awesome, so my family of four gave it another whirl, but our most recent visit was absolutely awful. A table that arrived after us (another group of four) were seated, served, presented their check, paid their bill and left before we got our food. They sent food out for 3 of 4 people at the table with no explanation on the missing plate, which we had to wait another 15 minutes for. Of the three meals that came out, all three were wrong- one set of poached eggs were undercooked and tasted strongly of vinegar, another meal was doused in sauce we ordered it without, and blueberry pancakes were raw in the center and oozed batter when we cut into them. The waitress, who was very apologetic and moderately embarrassed, returned the bad meals to the kitchen. While waiting for the second round of food, the manager came over and we shared what was happening, asking about the still missing fourth meal. She apologized and offered a free dessert, which we declined. About ten minutes later, we got new pancakes (which were good), and replacements for the other two meals. Of these, one set of poached eggs was over cooked (completely hard). The fourth meal was still missing at this point, and my son was nearly in tears. His food showed up another 5-10 minutes later, and by now we were ready to just leave. The waitress checked on us again, and was sympathetic when we asked for our bill so we could go. Shockingly, after all this, the manager didn't remove or reduce any charges on the $70 check. Unbelievably disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Ok so, this place.... went in it was full House. Cute decor and we were seated right away. We were really excited about the looks of the Menu. As we sat there waiting for our order to be taken we watched beautiful dish after dish being served. Dish after dish after dish after dish after dish after dish.... no one came to take even our drink order. Finally, a bus boy brought us water. Then again we watched dish after dish.... finally about 30 minuets later our order was taken. Best fresh squeezed orange juice! But after 45 minuets later.... after the mad rush of 17 soccer players were long gone, and a second glass of the best orange juice had been delivered (hoped it was on the house at this point) we continued to watch dish after dish after dish being served to others. The Chef came to apologize. We then continued to wait. We almost walked out and then my dish came. I felt bad to eat because my boyfriend did not get his. Mine looked good ish. It was their signature breakfast. Way too expensive for that dish. We had a Groupon so I splurged to get it. Finally, my boyfriend got his food. But, for as long as we waited and the waitress said it was not her fault and out of her hands.... then why the hell did my boyfriend have to get up to get ketchup. I mean you had an hour and a half to bring us ketchup for the fries that was ordered. Chef came back with a piece of bread pudding as a good Will Offering. We checked out. My second juice was not charged and they did not let us use the Groupon for it was a weekend. We had check in on yelp but did not get to have the free soda. What a fucking waist of time and money. I gave them 3 stars, because I know they will reach out to me and offer to give me a $100 gift card to their place and show me how they could do better then today and earn five stars. I have faith in them.",

This new (opened early this year) breakfast and lunch spot is a little out of the way but worth the trip. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and the food they prepare is top notch at a reasonable price. My wife's egg white omelette and my bacon & scrambled eggs were both top notch. The service was quick and attentive. The owner pointed out that the hardest part of launching a new dining spot is making people aware you're there. From experience, I can say with certainty that once discovered, they will have no difficulty in seeing repeat business. Oh, and the forks are sparkling clean",

I waited at least 15 mins before even getting ask what I would like to drink. Then I had to wait another 15 mins before drinks came out. What upset me was 1. The place wasn't too busy. Maybe 3/4 tables tops. 2. How is it that I've been waiting to be served for the last half hr and the table next to me gets served first? 3. I guess I was served short on one of my plates. Half way through my meal the waitress comes out with a side dish and says \"here's an extra side dish because we shorted you on your plate\". Seriously?!?! Again food was great but service was horrible",

It is a shame since I have had a good experience the first time I ate there. Aside from potential health risks, they do not treat their employees well, underpaid and under appreciated. I cannot support a business that does not see the value in good service to their customers AND staff. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised considering it's named The DIRTY fork...not far off there.",

I was not a fan of the dressing, but the salad itself was refreshing made with quality ingredients. I was really excited to try the Ms. Lorraine Quiche. The bacon, cheese, and egg was cooked perfectly and literally melted in my mouth. My only thing was it was cold when it was served to me and I did not like the crust at all. I prefer my quiche to be more flaky in texture. The Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese is always a must order everywhere I go. But unfortunately, it was also cold by the time it was served to me. The soup was decent, but I was not too crazy about the grilled cheese, I think it was the type of bread used. The food is good, but I think they should work on their recipes a bit more.  BAKERY: The owners seem to focus on recommending customers their bakery items more than their menu items. The macaroons were delicious and I highly recommend trying them. Their croissants and almond croissants were okay, but I wasn't too crazy about it. They were a bit hard for croissants.  DRINK: They serve the basic coffee, latte, and tea items you would want for brunch. Nothing too special. Water is served in a glass bottle.  ATMOSPHERE: This restaurant is a cross between a casual and fancy coffee shop. I have to say the service was great. Our waiter was really friend and attentive. I love the look of the place with the bright blue walls and shiny floors.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came in here for brunch after I saw so many delicious pictures on social media  So we couldn't resist since we love exploring Vegas's favorite local spots.   I got their avocado toast (I can't go anywhere without trying any place's avo toast for some reason) & a 9th Island French Toast which were both delicious. The avocado was only 1 slice of wheat toast with a lot of greens, 2 poached eggs & the avocado spread of course. You can get it with smoked salmon & cream cheese if you'd like as well. The French toast was 3 slices of sweet Hawaiian bread with fruit & very yummy coconut syrup.   My SO got a side of bacon, hash browns, & 2 eggs & a Take Me to Belgian Waffles with fruit & he expected more than just 1 Belgian waffle..   We both got coffee & everything tasted great. But we didn't expect our brunch bill to come out to almost $60.. for it to fill our stomachs contently. I recommend to not order sides to prevent it from being costly.   Come to Dirty Fork, the taste & presentation is absolutely amazing! So if you're willing to spend a little more out of pocket to try everything, it will be worth it.",

The menu is fun with a pretty wide range of choices including sandwiches, salads, bowls, wraps but also charcuteri and bruschetta.   Service was pleasant and quick.   VEGAS STYLE AVOCADO TOAST $11.50 The dish was meant to be made with smoked salmon which was not available and was substituted with Prosciutto. A bit of a disappointment but the dish was still fantastic. Fresh greens and Prosciutto piled on avocado toast and topped off with a glorious poached egg..   The coffee was fresh and delicious!   Other dishes had by our party looked equally yummy and were reported to be excellent. No one in this crowd would hesitate to return!  This is a great stop for breakfast or lunch.",

My only concern and why I cannot give them a 5 star was their focus on service delivery. As most new shops struggle in this area, Im trying hard not to tarnish their food review for it but they could definitely have benefitted if they put more attention on their customer base and some find some type of unique defining attire that differentiated the staff from normal customers.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see an eclectic breakfast/lunch menu that includes both some gourmet touches mixed with a good balance of more traditional food options.   Deciding on the 9th Island French Toast, I was looking forward to a delicious experience. While good, the french toast fell short of expectations. It was not remotely as sweet or sumptuous as I would expect from standard french toast at any other breakfast place. The fruit offered at an additional cost was also nothing significant, though aesthetically on point, and was essentially room temperature. Particularly for the price ($13.75 with The fruit add), I certainly expected something more memorable. I also was not offered a glass or ice for my can of diet coke. Seems strange, but not a huge issue for me.   All that being said, the food was decent and I will definitely return to try some of the other intriguing items on the menu to see if I better connect with a different item. The service itself was fast and the food was attractively plated. A gentleman, who I assume is the owner or at least manager, did stop by after my meal to check on me. He seemed concerned with the flavor, which makes me wonder if they have had complaints. I will say that I did not raise my concern at that time because overall everything was decent and they may intentionally be trying to downplay the sweetness of the dish. He also requested a review if I used Yelp, which is always a positive sign for a brand new restaurant.",

The very good coffee just kept coming. Thanks Maggie for taking such good care of us!",

The food here is fantastic and they have an expansive menu all the way from spam musubis to French macarons!  The eatery is very casual with spacious tables catering best to parties of any size. We had the fatty burrito (fantastic with crispy bacon), the Paris panini (delish), and the avocado toast (one of the best!). I also threw on a spam musubi and a dozen macarons (to take home) for good measure.  We'll be back for sure to try more brunch items.  Plus they have a dog-friendly patio! win win win!",

I like a good theme/ ambiance so that can really detour me from coming back. The size is a bit smaller so it's probably not great for large groups.  The food has a definite Hawaiian theme. They have musabi, moco loco and other Hawaiian favorites. Today I got the 9th island French toast which was delicious! I also ordered a diet coke which came in a can instead of from a soda fountain - which is not my favorite but its not a big deal.  It was overall really good.",

It was a good smothered dish but the turkey patty was almost like a sasuage rather than turkey burger. Basically it was too salty. We had fruit as the side because they were out of macaroni salad. This made us happy because my husband did not eat my fruit since she had his own.  Anyway I'll probably be back to see what else is yummy.",

My most recent visit was during a 3 hour wait time at the DMV down the road and decided to use Yelp to try out a new place to eat at since I had so much time before the DMV would call me up. Dirty Fork was previously bookmarked in my profile but I left it in my bookmarked section for awhile and remember seeing a few delicious looking posts from various Yelpers.   Upon arrival, I was greeted by Maggie and was seated promptly and given a Menu. She was quite knowledgeable of what is offered. It took me some time to decide what I wanted but I ended up with an order of the 9th Island French Toast with fresh fruits. When it arrived, I was like, \"Aloha!\" It was so big and filing. The actual Toast is made with Hawaiian Sweet Bread and was paired well with the Guava Cream Cheese. Every bite was scrumptious and mouth watering. I would come back for this if I wanted to an order of carb overload, lol. Great to share with someone or needing a delicious cheat day. Kudos to Jose, the cook for the Day. I wanted to try a few items but they were out of certain ingredienta so I was quite bum. However, I will come back to try more of their delicious food and if im feeling home sick.

They also charge $2.50 extra for \"egg whites only\" (for a dish that already includes eggs) because they use some expensive stuff from a carton. I asked them if they can just use regular egg and separate it from that since my dish already included eggs and the server agreed. Since we had to wait a while to put in the order I decided to time them to see how long it will take my order to come out. About 10 minutes later a staff member comes out and tells me they don't do that and absolutely have to use some previously separated egg white.   There is an obvious lack of communication between the staff and also, you should stick with one lie with either the egg white being from a carton or being previously separated by a staff. Not both. How sketchy.   I'm not sure why it took 10 minutes to tell me for a staff to tell me they can't serve my food when half the restaurant was empty. But I can say with confidence that all the horrible reviews on their service are absolutely correct!",

    "text": "I've been here twice now. My first review was a 4 because I  thought their food was good  and the service was okay. They messed up our order once  Today we went again and were seated at the table ( middle of the room). My boyfriend and one of daughters went out for brunch. We ordered breakfast: a belgian waffle for my daughter with orange juice, I got the goddess bowl( yogurt, fruit and granola) and a bagel with cream cheese and orange juice,  my boyfriend got a Belgian waffle, 2 eggs over medium, hash browns, veggie sausage and an orange juice and a coffer. We weren't given water. The guy( I'm assuming manager of sorts-not friendly) brings over a pineapple filled with rice and shrimp, and a Belgian waffle, and we're like that's not ours- we kept the Belgian waffle for our daughter. What we don't understand was why only 1 was given to us and we ordered 2.  He goes back to whatever he's telling the cooks. He comes back 10 minutes later with one dish that had eggs but bacon and something else. I'm pissed at this point- should've walked out. He comes back with the wrong food the third time. Seriously WTF and every  other table got the right stuff.  I swear that stupid table is cursed. Our food finally trickled in as we repeated everything we ordered multiple times. I got a bagel and they messed it up- at least to me. Plain bagel with cream cheese  ended up being a burnt bagel with some weird concoction of their interpretation of cream cheese- don't try it. The cream cheese stayed solid it was weird and gross.  We finally asked the for water and the guy brought us over a jug of water- no glasses. I guess we'll drink the water like a 40 . We're classy and all. The other food was pretty good though. We got our bill after they took off my bagel. It was $62. WTF. Apparently our orange juice alone was $15 for 3 tiny glasses. Eating breakfast at a little place shouldn't cost that much for 2 adults and an 11 year old. I am so disappointed . Don't  expect us back there. I don't recommend it for anyone.

    "text": "I was so disappointed not to enjoy a better experience at Dirty Fork.   I originally heard about this business after following their Facebook page since they advertised their pet friendly patio, as well as a drink promotion for bringing your pet along. Also, after my news feed was 'bombarded' with photos of delicious-looking Hawaiian-infused American brunch plates, it was about time to see what all the fuss was about!  I arrived here on a Saturday late morning for some brunch with friends, this time without the pup. As one friend was already there, I took a seat and immediately regretted wearing a sweater rather than layering in this winter weather - the heating in there feels like you're actually in Hawaii! Phewwww!  It took a while for a server to arrive, but when she did, we ordered some drinks and food. I couldn't decide between the afternoon tea or the Vegas Style Avocado toast, but the server quickly advised me that the pastries that come with the tea weren't fresh that day.  I appreciated the honesty, but was a little taken aback when she told my table that I would like the Avocado toast because I \"looked like I like avocado and seem the type to like a pretty plate\". I wasn't too sure I knew what she was getting at or where she'd assumed my food habits from after seeing me for all of 10 seconds. Not sure on how to respond to a stereotypical (and slightly insulting) remark, I just said 'ok' and we waited on our food.  This again took some time, as did one of our orange juices that was forgotten about, but after 20-30 minutes, plates arrived.  The avocado toast was presented well with a variety of different colours, textures and flavours to enjoy and it was plentiful for a brunch/breakfast dish. Digging in though, I was a little disappointed that the smoked salmon wasn't very fresh and had that slight texture and acidic taste to it after some time too long sat in the fridge. The blueberries were also going soft, so I picked the ones that seemed fresh enough to eat.  By the end, I was pretty full and didn't want to risk giving anything else a try at risk of it not being totally fresh or that the server would have an opinion on what I ordered, so we asked for the bill.  I presented the free soda Yelp check-in offer for a soda my friend had ordered, but was disappointed to find that despite not seeing any restrictions on the offer, I could not redeem on the weekend.  We were however given another flier for a free coffee with any meal, but again, despite no mention on the flier itself, was told by the server, only weekdays, so bare this in mind if you have a coupon to present!  Overall, underwhelming. Dirty Fork seems to have so much potential and the concepts and craft behind each dish are unique and seemingly delicious. I just felt they fell short on my visit here.",

    "text": "The food was below average. My girlfriend and I got French toast, a croissant sandwich with eggs bacon and cheese, and a side of hash browns. The French toast was ok except for the fact that it was on the mushy side. I would have preferred it to be more fluffy than mushy, and more of a crisp on the outside. The croissant sandwich was ok, but the hash browns were bad. They weren't crispy, and didn't taste fresh, they tasted like the ones in the super market from the frozen section.  The real issue was with the service. Firstly, the table was way too small. Everything was really crowded and we had to pay attention throughout the meal to try to watch our elbows and not knock anything over. My girlfriend ended up knocking her fork over by accident so we were trying to get the waitresses attention to get a new one, but she never came over. I ended up giving my girlfriend my fork and having to eat with my hands the French toast with syrup and get my hands all dirty. She also never brought us the napkins we requested, and was confused about whether the guac comes with onions or tomatoes.  Still, the biggest issue ended up being with the payment. We had a Groupon that we told the waitress about in the beginning. When we went to pay, they said they wouldn't accept it because it was a weekend. It may have been in the fine print somewhere, but it certainly wasn't made clear to us. Putting things in fine print to deceive a customer into buying something that they otherwise wouldn't buy is not the right thing to do, and indicates that you're not confident in your product (in this case food).  We went to pay and they redeemed the groupon such that it was taken from our Groupon balance, but they wouldn't take the money off of the bill. So now we had to lose the money we paid to Groupon, and not get the discount in return. We argued with a manager for about ten minutes at the table, because THEY made the mistake of redeeming our Groupon even though they don't accept them on weekends. Other people were watching, but he was very stubborn and wouldn't budge. Very bad experience for us, but at the end of the day, probably a more harmful experience for them in lost business.",

Well we tried to see what this place is all about and decided to get delivery. After waiting an hour and a half we called to rudely be told that the food is ready now and on its way. 30 minutes later we call Grubhub and they stated the restaurant said they're too busy and on its way now. If you have enough time to inform Grubhub that you're too busy, then inform the customer that's waiting patiently. You just put it in order of how the order comes in and if you can't handle that, then don't advertise you get order delivery though Grubhub, Postmates, UberEats and Eat24. We are currently still waiting on cold food as they said they were 5 minutes, 12 minutes ago.",

    "text": "I've been here about 5 times. They have totally messed up the orders of me and/or my party on two occasions already. These mess ups include taking forever to bring out an item from the bakery case, then finding they were out, as well as cooking orders wrong then doing it over wrong again, to over seasoning the food. Also, even though the food items generally taste very good and look beautiful, the pricing is pretty steep for the amount of food. After the last set of mistakes, I was given multiple coupons for the future which is one of the reasons I came back today with my parents. As they made a few more mistakes w the food today, I was even more disappointed to hear that the owner will no longer honor the free coffee coupon or the 10% off which were given as a result of their prior mistakes (and which had no expiration date on them).  The place is never busy which I like and the servers are very friendly and accommodating, but the policies at this place and ownership are not so great. Honestly, as much as I enjoy the calm island atmosphere, I am not sure that I will come back.",

    "text": "Came to this place based on ratings..won't do that again.  The place was nice, but the service was very slow and the food overpriced and nothing to rave about.  It took like 20 min or so to get regular coffee  and the owner comes over to us apologizing and says that the coffee will be free and that he just opened the place 2 or 3 weeks ago and doesn't have enough servers.  When I ordered the crepes with nutella, one with banana and one without, I was told by the waitress that she wasn't going to tell the cooks that because they were so busy and it was going to make them mad, that she could tell them to put the banana on the side.  The place was not even at full capacity, and there certainly wasn't a crowd waiting for a table.   And they still didn't get the order right anyway!  My instinct was to get up and go but I decided to let it slide.  I ordered the Vegas Style Toast and it simply was not good.  The poached eggs were still kind of raw and were totally bland.  It grossed me out so I had the waitress take it.  I decided to only order a bagel instead of a new full dish because of how long it took to get our food in the first place.  Even that took like 10 minutes!  My son's hash browns with onions were burned and  he said that the crepes we make at home were better.  I tried the omelette my husband ordered and we agreed that wasn't good either.  When it came time to pay the bill the Vegas Toast had not been removed.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that her boss said we still had to pay for it.  I was obviously not happy with having to pay for a dish that was so disgusting to me.  I took my kids and went to wait for my husband in the car I was so pist.  When my husband comes out he says he told the owner that I didn't like what I got and the owner responded by saying that I didn't like a lot of things, that I wasn't in the mood.   What a professional!  Don't try to pin on me the fact that the food and service was so damn shitty!  This guy clearly has no experience in the food business and much less in customer service!  I doubt this place will be open for long.  Even the waitress told my husband that it wasn't right that we had to pay for the dish.  The one star for this place is too much!",

    "text": "Well before I start, let me say that with great fortune, I am able to dine at so many of the Michelin star places on a regular places from Rubicon in Paris to Il mullno in Manhattan to Providence in Los Angeles and so many in Vegas including Nobu, Gordon Ramsey ( EWWW) , Giada, Alize', SW, Guy savoy and on and on . It is also out of necessity cause my lovely wife do not like the sight of a cook top, I was told it causes a rash of some sort and I believe it as it puts her in a odd mood all day when she does enter the room called kitchen! She saw this place one day and suggest we go there and give it a try as that is our hobby living in Vegas to try any place we have not been before at home or when we travel. Sometimes it is a fantastic surprise and sometimes it is a disaster. The chef/owner came and introduce himself and told us he was at the Wynn for 10 years and that sets me up to have high expectations. I am pleased to say, it does not disappoints as the room is cute and pleasant with a nice park view, parking is abundant and the food is great! Fruit is fresh and the croissant is as good as any in Paris, all the little things are done right, the egg in my croissant is slightly browned and portions are good for humans but not gluttons so don't expect a feeding trough but a civilized portion! Tomato soup is note worthy, perfect balance of flavor and texture, it is common to be over salted and this one is not. Coffee is good and hot and the dessert which we took home was a very nice surprise for a breakfast place, is it as good as Angelina  in Paris? Certainly not as elaborate but for what they do make, comparable and that is a high praise if you ever been to Angelina in Paris. In finally, we will be back with friends and I honestly do think one thing they can do and that is to raise the price a little, for what they serve, they deserve a few more dollars, that is what I think of this place, enough said.",

The macaroni salad that cake with the Loco Moco was the best I've ever had.  The server said it was made in-house.  The pastries looked really good, but we didn't try any this time.

The aesthetic & decorum of the entire place was very alluring, although the service - not so much....   My friend and I entered the store around 1:02, we got seated and waited. It took about 10 mins for the someone to realize we did not have any menus and have been waiting for someone to come help us. We our waters a couple minutes later and order our food within 20 mins of arrival. It was extremely busy during the time we went. My friend and I literally waited almost an hour afterwards for our food (which I have no complaints about). There was only TWO chefs working and cooking all the food for everyone and it took extremely long. I was certainly not expecting to wait so long for average tasting food. This was such a hinderance on my time.   Not only that but my other friend order an acai bowl and it literally came out like soup!! with barely any fruit or granola or anything to mask the horrid taste. For $11.50 it was certainly not worth every penny. Although I do thank management for giving her extra honey, extra granola, and extra fruit - because girl let me tell you that acai bowl was well very bland.   I will most likely not come again. It was a very cute restaurant with a lot of potential, although they definitely need to work on time management and hire some more chefs!!!",

The prices were a bit more on the expensive then other breakfast places I've been to. The first time when I was here, the food came our really slow and the service was...slow and inattentive. The chef and the serve both came out to say sorry and that they just opened.   Second time, I came with girl friend since I saw there was a Groupon special. I wanted my Eggs Benedict that I had last time and the server let me know the menu has changed due to a change of owners. Well, basically everything REALLY changed because the food wasn't as good and the service was even worst then the last time I was here. We ordered a kale salad since my friend saw a picture of it and it came out completely different with mixed green salad and just a few pieces of baby kale. My friend also ordered orange juice and a cranberry juice for her and her daughter. The juice cups were the size of a kids meal cup and charging $3 for cranberry and $4 for OJ.  Needless to say, I will not be returning....",

    "text": "Talk about nice little breakfast/brunch spot off the strip. I always wanted to check out Dirty Fork because honest the name does peak one interest. More so close to the house for me and always looking for new spots nearby. My first impression was talk about REALLY really nice interior decor. I know the place before was also breakfast/lunch spot but am sure not as nice. The display case with the fresh pastries is on point! The different pastries all looked hell of tasty just had no room for any once realize the size of the 9th island french toast. Three different areas in the restaurant. The bar area once walk in that had all these different cool light fixtures hanging down, the main dining area, and in the back little booth area that has really cool framed artwork hanging on the wall. The whole Dirty Fork name and big Fork on another wall. I like the personality in it. They do have some outdoor patio available.   9th island French Toast was screaming at me for first visit. I know just cause from 808. Really when reading the description the key was \"Hawaiian Sweet Bread\". It something that not see often on menus in general. Who would have thought basic French Toast concept but use Hawaiian Sweet Bread. Brilliant! Not only the Toast but add the guava cream cheese and coconut syrup went tropical island style. I added fresh fruit (Strawberries and Blueberries) not only more filling but balances out all the flavors. Talk about nice portion size if carbs is the game you get your money worth on this one. lol. It was winnah!  I also ordered fresh orange juice. The only reason mention it is that they squeeze juice everyday. You can tell the difference. Super refreshing and perfect drink with my breakfast.   The service was five stars. The waiter told him first time explaining everything checking up  making sure everything was great. The owner is awesome. I love seeing small business owners out in the dining room asking for feedback on the food. Honest. Friendly. Grateful. Genuine. Someone that not only has passion for the food but cares about customers.   The prices are very reasonable. If looking for great spot start the day Dirty Fork is great spot! Or if any your plans involves Desert Breeze Park head across the street for food later.",

We came in around 11:30am and were seated right away. I really enjoyed the interior and decor of the restaurant, I felt like it was very cute and quaint which is the perfect design for a breakfast/brunch place! :) The menus have two sides - one side for breakfast and the other for lunch. There were a variety of options which made it hard to choose but we decided to go for the \"Fatty Burrito\" and the \"Dirty Fork Lunch Special.\" I subbed the bacon on the breakfast burrito for turkey bacon and salad instead of fresh fruit on the side and my bf subbed his side for hash browns with onions (which was phenomenal!).   Our food took a while to come out considering the fact there was only two other tables in the restaurant but our server was super friendly and kept refilling our waters and reassuring us that our food would be out soon. I wasn't entirely impressed with the burrito and halfway while I was eating I noticed that I didn't get my pico de gallo that comes with it, but the server was able to bring me out a side of it immediately. my bf's entree was very delicious! It consisted of salmon, poached eggs, mushrooms, veggies, and butter on top of a whole grain toast - definitely recommend to try this dish!   Overall, it was a good first time experience. The owner came around making sure we were enjoying our food and at the end, even gave us a flyer that gives us two free coffees on our next visit, yay!",

    "text": "There are so many great places to eat breakfast in SW LV -- and while the food was really pretty delicious (although really expensive for what you got), we witnessed several violations of what would be considered inappropriate food handling. For instance, the  sliding door for the reach in cooler where the pastries are kept was left open for the entire hour that we were eating -- because they were also storing raw eggs for the brunch service in that case as well. I'm fairly sure that you're not supposed to store raw poultry/uncooked eggs next to uncovered ready-to-serve food. What's more, it was a hot Las Vegas summer day -- with the entire door open and a tower of probably 100 eggs just sitting there in convenient reach for the cook, you can't convince me that those eggs were being kept at a safe temperature. I watched the staff with this reach in too -- keeping the door open must be standard operating procedure for them because they never ONCE shut the door, which would be a habit/muscle memory for those servers if it were normally closed. To make matters worse, there were tons of flies in the restaurant, which is a huge warning sign that garbage is not being removed/floors are not being cleaned properly -- that many flies inside a restaurant means that they had/have maggots somewhere. And even grosser-- those flies were happily hanging out in the pastry case thanks to the open door. This is but one violation that I witnessed -- in that short time there, I saw a waitress move from touching cash to pulling toast and buttering it (touching it with her hands) without stopping to wash her hands. If these simple habits that are so public aren't being followed, can you imagine how bad the areas you can't see are?  It's too bad -- the food really was tasty.",

    "text": "Is this place French? Am I crazy? Dirty Fork doesn't sound like a french name but the vibes are definitely french, not to mention the menu has items that have clearly french names. It's just that the name \"Dirty Fork\" didn't make me think \"french bistro.\" Which also means that I was not prepared for the higher than average pricing. I ordered a Paris Panini and it was good but nothing special. I replaced the salad with hashbrowns and those were bomb! They cook them with onion and I didn't even need ketchup to enjoy them. My boyfriend got the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special. He liked it but I didn't even try it because I really was not in the mood for chicken.  I think the shock of thinking it would be something it wasn't turned off my boyfriend from it, but I will certainly come back. I enjoyed my time and learning about what this place offers. The portions are  smaller than other comparable restaurants but I thought it was perfect sizing. It was enough to eat everything and feel full but not so much that I felt sick or had to take some home. I was particularly impressed by their coffee! I am by no means a coffee snob, I can be equally satisfied by 7/11 brew as LavAzza but this was smooth and perfect even without creamer.   Will be back!",

    "text": "I was REALLY looking forward to dining at The Dirty Fork. 3 girlfriends and I decided to meet here for our monthly breakfast date. We had a groupon to use and were excited when we looked at the menu.   We arrived when there was only two other tables occupied so it was lovely and quiet. The server greeted us but immediately seemed frazzled just getting us water.   My 3 year old son tagged along as well and I asked for an orange juice for him, to which she replied, \"Well that will be a little while because I have to squeeze it and everything.\" Okkkkk....was she trying to convince me not to get it? Then I said, \"Ok, do you have kids sizes? It's just for my little guy.\" She started walking away and said, \"No we have one size. It's five dollars so, it doesn't matter who orders it.\"   Then came the ordering of other drinks. She came back and asked what we'd like. I told her I was fine with water. My friend across from me asked for orange juice, which she again told us it would be a bit since she had to squeeze it. Then my other friend ordered an iced coffee (which is on the menu), to which the server responded, \"We don't have cappuccino or anything, we're basically out of everything today. We didn't get our delivery.\" My friend told her, \"That's fine I just wanted regular iced coffee.\" She said, \"Ok I don't have beans or anything.\" So my friend said, \"So do you have coffee?\" and the server said, \"Yeah I can make regular iced coffee.\" ........?!?!?!?!?!?!?? Then my next friend asked for a latte....oh brother, the server was clearly pissed now. She said, \"I don't have stuff for lattes. Do you just want water?\" My friend said, \"What are your assorted teas?\" (Listed that way on the menu) and the server said, \"We have green tea and English breakfast.\" My friend told her she'd have English breakfast with lemon, and the server said, \"Not honey? Usually it comes with honey.\"   Ok, moving on to food. We ordered and had no issues ordering the food, all of which was fantastic. The saving grace of this place was the food was fantastic.   Now it's time to pay. I thought her head might explode. We told her about the Groupon in the beginning but she brought the check without taking it off, so my friend said, \"Oh you forgot the Groupon\" and she said, \"Oh well you know you shouldve reminded me.\"  She then looked at the paper printout my friend brought and said, \"Can't you pull it up on your phone so i can redeem it immediately? Otherwise we have to send it in and it's a big pain for him.\" (\"Him\" being the owner, i presume?) My friend tried to pull it up but was not getting service in the restaurant so the server (tapping her fingers on the table) said, \"Ugh I'll just take this. I just don't want it to kick back to him that it doesn't work.\" Then she took it and came back with the adjusted check and we handed her our credit cards asking her to split it 4 ways evenly. She said, \"Oh I cant Split the check or the Groupon won't work.\" I said, \"Oh we're not splitting it, we're just paying with multiple forms of payment. That shouldn't matter.\" She said, \"No I can't. You'll have to pay for it with one form of payment.\" As a former waitress, I was floored by her behavior and terrible service up to this point but this response was laughable. Finally I decided to just pay for it and we had to get it figured out how much each owed and how to Venmo it. All while my newborn was screaming.   Time to go. We said goodbye to each other and as I went to grab my son, the server snatched the paybook off the table which caused my keys to fall. As I'm holding my car seat in my arm and my sons hand with my other arm, she didn't even pick them up.   Bottom line, as a diner, I don't care one bit what you're out of or why, what inconvenience you might incur because of a coupon program YOU participated in, the fact that you only have ONE server and by the time we left there were 8 tables of people, or the mood of said server because she's dealing with all these issues.   They say you come for the food but you come back for the service. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE. For $5 per glass of juice, and $12.50 for 2 tiny Nutella crepes with one spoonful of whipped cream, you better be kissing my ass, and this was a joke.",

I'm being generous with the 4 star rating simply because the customer service was fairly decent. But if I had to rate solely on the food, it would probably be a two star.   My daughter ordered the kids chicken tenders meal, but she only ate the fries. She took a picture of her lunch, which I added to the review. I ordered a chicken panini, but they didn't have any panini bread available, so I settled for an English muffin. I'm not going to bash this place, simply because the food wasn't what I expected. I just won't return.",

I think it's important that all employees are aware of and practice safe food handling. After ordering an orange juice I watched our server head to the back bar and use her hands to put ice in the mason jar style cups. I sent my husband over to ask her to serve mine sans ice. I've also never had a fries squeezed OJ served with ice sooo there's that. The juice came from a pitcher in the fridge so although I'm positive it is fresh squeezed, I am sure the ice is not for temperature purposes.   It seems like they penny pinch here. Between icing the OJ and charging $2 for a hash brown sub (instead of the greens served with the omelette).   I ordered the 9th island French toast, our server noticed it was missing the toasted coconut and coconut syrup and promptly brought it over. Honestly, it was delicious. When ordering she asked if I wanted fruit added to it. I declined but it came with a bit of fruit anyways. Exactly 6 blueberries, 3 small chunks of melon and 1/3 slice of a strawberry. The fruit was awkward and most of the blueberries were not in the best shape.   My husband ordered the omelette, as described above. Though lacking in flavor, I really like the idea of the thin layer of hash browns which ensures you get a nice crunch all around.    The restaurant itself had basic decor. Not bad, not intriguing. It was hot but without tinting their windows I don't think there's much they can do about that since the sun happens to rise on that side.   Overall, the cost did not justify the experience. I think with some work they could do well. The menu needs a revamp. It's hard to navigate. It's just a list of food items with nothing that really draws the eye.",

I ordered the Paris Panini, and the sandwich came out with thick, fluffy bread that wasnt pressed at all... and the eggs were done scrambled... this wasn't specified on the menu and it was my fault for assuming a French style panini would come with eggs another way. It had no flavor. It was $11... I could have made a better sandwich at home for pennies compared to that.

After checking out from the hotel we decided to head on over to the Dirty Fork which was about a 20 minute drive from the Strip. We arrived and was instantly seated.  I have to say the decor was so cute and trendy and I was curious of how this restaurant received its name. But mostly hoping that the forks were actually clean. Anywho, they had so many delicious looking items in their dessert case that were calling my eye but I ended up just get a Chicken Pesto Panini. If you know me I am not a huge Panini person and decided to try something different which was a flop.  I honestly did not enjoy my Panini at all. It was so dry and burnt. It was so hard to chew. But I ate it as I was hungry. The staff appeared to be in training as they did not appear to know what they were doing. One staff member broke a glass behind me and glass went everywhere.  The service was SO slow and they kept messing up on everything. They got my brothers order wrong twice. They forgot a second order of his Sahemi.  Other patrons dining in were experiencing the same problems as well. It may have been just an off service day but not a good impression after dining at Hells Kitchen the evening before.  Mostly everyone in the group enjoyed their meal but I was not happy about the SLOW service, blah food and messed up orders.  Maybe another day is better but the Sunday that we went they were having serious problems. I'm all about second chances but it is definitely hard to consider this restaurant due to my experience.",

    "text": "After reading Yelp reviews for restaurants in the area, Dirty Fork was one that really stood out! The fun decor and delicious food pics enticed us mostly.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted and seated. Our drink orders were taken immediately. The inside was clean and inviting. They even have a dessert case filled with a variety of pastries (scones, Macarons, crossaints, danish, cookies, cannoli, and bread pudding)   We ended up ordering the Hilo Style Loco Moco, Dirty Fork Breakfast Special, and a side of bacon and fruit bowl. Everything was absolutely delicious! I can't complain about anything. It was a lot of food for two people, but it was so good, we ate every morsel and ended up skipping lunch!   The staff was friendly and the food came out fast! This restaurant is located in a strip mall so there's plenty of parking available. Would highly recommend!",

We were headed back into town after running some trails out at Aramgosa, and decided to stop for brunch.   The restaurant wasn't busy late morning on a Saturday, with no wait, so we were pleasantly surprised.  I doubt we are able to get in that easy again in the future once people start talking about this place!  First race, the coffee!  It was some Italian brand and it was amazing.  Rich and smooth, served at the perfect temperature.  We tried a few of the breakfast items: the What the Fork omelette, Sunrise Sammy and Parisian Panini.  Everything was delicious, tasty and fresh.  Everything was cooked per our requests.  The service was lacking.  It was slow and forgetful, especially with the restaurant not being at all busy.  Hopefully, this is just a learning curve with new staff.  Parking was easy, free, plentiful and convenient right in front of the restaurant 's storefront.  I will most definitely be returning again for brunch to the Dirty Fork!",

I was too excited to eat.  I ordered anyway...  \"What The Fork\" Omelet jumped out at me: Bell peppers, mushrooms, sweet onions, Swiss cheese, with avocado and a side of Toast...yum!  I usually like breakfast and an omelette is something that can't really be messed up, right?

So by the time 1pm rolled around and I was about to have breakfast food for lunch, I was starved and was ready to attack some good eats.  Before we all got to Vegas, the suggestion was made to hit this place up. I wasn't all that impressed by what I saw on Yelp, but hey, why not try anyway? Right?! Well, I'll tell ya why not. My food sucked!  So these guys have quite a bit of things on the menu here, and after looking it over for awhile, I decided on getting the Fatty Burrito. For whatever reason, my food took the longest to come out. And I don't even know why because it was a Fatty Burrito that was fat with mostly eggs. After the first couple of bites, there was hardly any bacon, cheese, or guacamole in it. And the sucker was nasty tasting too. It was hella salty. A salty egg burrito is what I had. Lol.  Thank goodness I was in the company of friends who more than made up for the crappy burrito I got. And although our server was friendly and attentive, it ain't enough to bring me back. Nuff said!",

Call me crazy but I'm glad they have clean forks here. ;P  Any time I see eggs benny on a menu, I gotta have it! It fulfills my horror movie fantasies when I stab into a gently poached egg and all their bodily-yolky-fluid comes cascading out like a waterfall of yellowish-orange goo! Are you readers hungry yet? Hah!   So I ordered the Eggs-quisite Benedict. The accompanying salad was fresh and the vinaigrette was flavorful. The eggs itself were poached nicely, the yolk popping and bleeding profusely at the softest prick of a knife, but sadly my hollandaise was broken. A broken hollandaise is a sin [see the attached picture for the curdled mess]! I was heartbroken but I was with a fun bunch so I didn't bother telling the waitstaff about it.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean. I had fun with my Yelp homies from Honolulu, Orange County, and Torrance! It was a our own little Yelper Party!",

I had been eyeing their 9th Island French Toast on Instagram for quite some time, so when I finally had a day off, I was excited to finally try it. The restaurant itself is cute, homey and bright. We were seated right away, but the tables for 2 are super tiny! They ended up having to move us to a bigger table because the table wouldn't hold all of our food and drinks.  The coffee was delicious, and the server allowed me to use my Yelp check in for coffee instead of soda, which I appreciated. We wanted the 9th Island French Toast, as I mentioned, but wanted to make it a combo with eggs and meat. The server pointed us to a French toast combo platter, so we got that. It came with chicken and eggs, which I thought was an interesting combo. I asked the server if the chicken came as pieces, because I wanted to specify dark meat. She said yes, and moved along with our order.   Imagine our surprise when the French toast was just regular French toast with sliced strawberries on it, and the chicken was \"pieces of breaded chicken\"- basically like chopped up chicken nuggets!! Uh, definitely not what we expected.  The French toast was fine, but there wasn't anything special about it. It didn't come with butter on it, and they only had packets of margarine. The chicken actually didn't taste badly, it just was unexpected! The eggs were very good though.  Our total with the coffee and two platters was $31.   Nothing to write home about, but I wasn't upset at the experience. The hunt for great breakfast spots continues!",

Very excited you finally taste the food (which was the reason why I wanted to go in the first place).   To be honest service was a little better. Our server was very nice & friendly but overall staff doesn't seem to be engaging.   Food came out & looked amazing; not just mine. My food came out (picture attached) & it was tasty but just not incredible as I had hoped it to be. Price point was not bad either.   _____________  Let's paint a picture...just under 30minutes to spare before one of only like 2 breakfast places in the area are getting ready to close. I saw a picture of the pancakes and read a review about how great the food was. I was so excited. As I walked into the restaurant at 3:08pm, I was barely greeted with one of the servers kinda of under her breath saying they were closed. The restaurant advertised online and on the front door to close at 3:30pm with 2 tables still dining but the CLOSED sign flipped on the door. The server asked the cook if he wanted to turn on the grill (which means they must have shut down early and cleaned it to not want to turn it back on; someone was ready to get out of work early today)   Fortunately, with all that is available in the area, I will never return to this place just on the laissez-fair attitude they have. How over-the-top could this place be if the ethic of the place is to shut down whenever they feel like it.   Good luck.   For those that read this, just a friendly reminder that just around the corner Mimosas Gourmet is scheduled to open until 4pm. Friendly & professional service. Check my next review for the upcoming food",

It already comes with fruit and I didn't want any. The Sunrise Sammy is good but croissant is way too toasted that the ends are so hard I left it behind. Like the croissant was toasted over and over. Honestly, server didn't deserve tip; she bought water with no ice which I never once stated I DIDNT want ice, she took order and delivered. Than I went up to register asking to pay.

I had the Dirty Fork Lunch Special which was delicious and came with fresh fruit.

I'm apologize if you're reading this I'm horrible with remembering names) was what made my experience a 5 star one. He was friendly and sociable he must've chatted with me and my friend for 10 or so minutes and I really dig that about a place when the owner makes time for you to engage in friendly conversation.

First visit and will definitely return. Happened upon The Dirty Fork when we stopped there to eat at a previous restaurant that used to reside at the same location and had moved. Decided to give The Dirty Fork a try and so glad we did. While you may think upon initially looking at the menu that the prices are a bit high, fear not, as you'll get more than your monies worth in quantity and excellent quality. As the four of us shared our food from our plates, when have you ever done that at breakfast, we noticed other diners eating there at the same time we were sharing their food with each other too. :-)  currently there's a Groupon, so get it while you can.",

The location is convenient, and sitting on the patio gets you a decent view of the grassy park across the street - PLUS, it's dog friendly on the patio. The owner even brought my pup a little dog biscuit, and the server made sure he had plenty of water. My sister and I split the Vegas Avocado Toast and the greek yogurt bowl (forgetting the name now). The dishes themselves were beautifully presented and cooked perfectly. They have enough healthy choices that you don't feel gross after you're done inhaling everything! The service was great, quick, and we had plenty of coffee refills. We enjoyed taking our time over our meal, and the owner came out to talk with us a few times. He mentioned they plan on gating in the patio, which will make dog owners feel more secure and help give the place some curb appeal. Will definitely be back!",

Five minutes after we ordered the server notified us that they were out of blueberries. That isn't what killed it for me. Upon receiving the \"special,\" I immediately wondered where the chicken was. Oh, there it is. It was 2 oz of finely diced frozen, processed chicken strips. Let me remind you that this dish costs $13. The owner/chef came to our table twice to make sure everything was ok. The second time I attempted to explain to him that I was disappointed they had used frozen, processed chicken. He explained that they couldn't use fresh chicken because it wouldn't be crispy. Wow!! Well, Sir, I invite you to go to any place in Vegas and try something called CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!! You will certainly be served a hand breaded piece of actual chicken. One more place crossed off the list... shame shame",

My mom and I came in for breakfast around 9am and the place had about 2 tables that were filled(expected because it is still quite new). The waiter brought us our menus and I realized there weren't any vegetarian or vegan options (I'm a vegetarian) so I opted to ask the waiter what my choices were and he told me \"a salad\" and that tone in his voice was so rude and insincere. In the end (without his help) I opted for a fruit bowl and hash browns. Now, when my hash browns came out they came out black (literally, both sides were black and burnt) and when I brought this to the waiters attention he played off the burnt hash brown saying \"hash browns are like this\" (????? At this point it's clear he obviously eats from the dumpster) so I asked if I could have it browned instead & the second time they came perfect. NOW, this waiter at this point knows I'm a vegetarian but he didn't think to tell me that the hash browns were cooked with butter... I took a bite of the hash browns and ~butter explosion~. The owner did come to check up on us once and he seems like he genuinely wants this place to flourish and the food is decent BUT TRAIN YOUR WAITSTAFF THEY ARE THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT!!!!!",

    "text": "First time eating here I stumbled across this place on Instagram and thought I'd give it a try on 8/11/18 my first take on the establishment was it was beautiful, nice and clean and there were a good amount of people inside not too busy so it had to be a good establishment. The staff was at first friendly and had greeted me and my partner when we walked through the doors and immediately seated us.  Being from the islands that was the True ALOHA spirit.   FIRST, We were given the menus and  of course as any typical establishment asks what we would like to drink- we asked for water. Our waitress walked out with a   Cylinder of water and two small cups she had filled them up and walked away. When I looked up I noticed not only was my water dirty(like dirt floating in the cylinder) but my cup also had lipstick on it (mind you I was not wearing any) When our waitress had came back to take our order I had asked her if she could take the water back and if we could order bottled water instead.(At this point she had an attitude because she had to get us bottled water).  SECOND, when our food came out and of course plated beautifully I had the What the Fork Omelette & my Partner had the 9th Island French Toast.. We had requested that the coolwhip and guava cream cheese be placed on the side they had placed them in these small little stainless steel condiment cups those cups were DIRTY too and had gunk and left over food  underneath the rim of the container.  At this point I was disgusted and was ready to request for the check.   I had mentioned the second incident to our waitress yet again and requested for our check she then asked us if we would like to go plates and I looked at her in disbelief and asked her as to why she would ask us that after we mentioned everything that has taken place since we came thru the doors and she has not once acknowledged anything and acted completely oblivious to everything we mentioned.. at least a \" sorry mam, let me take care of that for you\" she then walked away  NEVER brought us our CHECK and stayed behind the counter talking to another person.  At this point I was irritated, I had  walked up to the counter there was a male waitress at the register printing out checks for tables. I asked him for my check he looked at me with a blank stare for a good 2-3 minutes and then goes \"oh I'm not your waiter you got to ask her\" and taps my waitress on the shoulder she turns her head slightly  looks at me  and goes right back to talking to thee other person I continue to wait for another good 2-3 minutes before I raise my voice and Say EXCUSE ME I am ready to PAY and get the hell out of here. She takes my payment with attitude and notices when I do not give a TIP gives even more of an attitude.    Needless to say this will be my FIRST and LAST time coming here.. your employees are a HUGE representation of your company and if that is who you choose to represent your company I must say you are in trouble. I completely understand we have good days and bad days but this was just ridiculous. And then to EXPECT a TIP? A tip should never be EXPECTED especially if you have a bad attitude and horrible service!",

They were open for breakfast on Thanksgiving, which we out-of-towners really appreciated. The 9th island French toast was some of the best French toast I've ever had (and I order French toast at every breakfast spot I go to). It was perfectly cooked (no dry spots in the center yet still tall and fluffy) and the guava cream cheese spread was the perfect touch, just enough to give it a unique, intoxicating flavor but not overly cream cheesy or sweet or gimmicky. Just absolute perfection. The coffee was fantastic too, as were the croissants. Really excellent place all around with a great laid back, welcoming vibe.",

    "text": "The service here is very unorganized and does not seem to know what they are doing. While waiting we noticed a couple of times they had to move already seated customers to another table, which made them upset. There was also a wet rag on the floor that was dropped from the busser that was running across the restaurant from the table he just seated. The lady that was seated had to kick the dirty rag to the side. Gross. We sat down and wasn't given any menus to look at. Made our food choices from looking at photos on yelp. Waitress came 10 minutes after to take our order. Another 20 minutes no water or coffee was served to our table. My daughter was thirsty, so I had to get up and walk to the front of restaurant where 3 different servers were standing there. One server told our server to bring us water and coffee. She came by apologized saying she's \"running around like a chicken.\" She came back with 2 complimentary macaroons. Waited a while again and my husband had to ask for utensils and napkins. My food and my daughters French toast came out after waiting about 35 minutes. My husbands loco moco, however, came out 15 minutes after ours. His food finally came out was told that they messed up his order not having the fried rice on it. The patty had no seasoning in it. It just tasted like meat. So we ate our \"so-so\" meal and waited for the waitress to pick up our check. They were busy dealing with another upset customer at the moment. I ended up having to walk up to the register to pay for my meal and they gave us 10% off.",

Not even enough time to actually go somewhere else to eat due to the fact that we both have work at 3 and this got here at 2:20 although my order confirmation was made at 1:09 .  The manager was contacted and blames the food being burnt and acai bowl being melted as a part of my fault for ordering it in such hot weather and being that I live far .  Even management is a disappointment , take responsibility for your restaurants action we didn't Fuck up our order you guys did !!",

My breakfast consisted of a dry piece of toast with one slice of avocado cut into three pieces hidden under a bunch of lettuce with a slice of tomato and cucumber. My friend ordered an omelette. Her omelette was supposed to have avocado. It didn't. I complained to the Cook when he brought over my friend's English muffin. He said they ran out of avocado. If you run out of the main ingredient of a dish, you should offer the customer a different meal. They made no attempt to correct the issue and charged us for both meals. They gave us coupons for a free cup of coffee next time we come in. We will never be back!!! Absolutely unacceptable!!!",

I don't mind tap water but I prefer it cold with ice. Our water taste like it just come from the sink. We were never given the option of drinks or coffee. After looking at the menu the server comes by and ask if we are ready to order I told her yes we're ready and she walks away to another table. The vibe was very off with loud quick paced elevator music but we could hear the radio from the kitchen area playing 50cent and lil John \"get low\" and they were not the clean version. That was entertaining part of our meal. As the lady came to take our order again I told her I wanted chicken fingers and fries I flipped the menu over to see the sauces they have and she took the menu from my hands. Wth! The food was okay but over priced. I asked for ranch on the side they gave me half of a shot of ranch. The portions are large so I asked for one more and she comes and tells me she should be charging me for this but won't. I don't care if I have to pay extra for ranch but at least fill up the cup. We had to go find the server to get our bill and pay and to top everything off they charged me $2 for using a Groupon app. So now I'm confused why get a groupon but get charged to use it. If I knew this I would have stuck to our usual babystacks. I was super stoked to like this place because we love brunch locations but I almost walked out after ordering. Never again",

The food is a mixture of Hawaii, France, and Good Ol' USA.  It serves primarily Breakfast/Lunch foods and most of what I've had is solid.  The service is friendly but at times very scattered.  The best part is that you don't find the hour long waits many other breakfast/brunch places are known for...It is hit or miss with crowds.  I enjoy the pastries and the burgers.  Those are the best bets in my eyes.",

    "text": "Ah I seriously don't like to leave bad reviews, and have only ever left one. This one just needs to be said. Came here after reading a great review and was really excited. Looks mostly cute and modern minus the very tacky ornaments and black curled ribbon hanging everywhere. Those IKEA lights would look a million times better if they didn't have all those extra frills suffocating them. I wanted to cut them down so bad! Please adjust this and let your restaurant be a restaurant and not a quinceanera who's favorite color is teal. Okay no that's not most important, the food clearly is.  We glanced over the menu and saw some awesome looking things. Lady at the table next to me had this great looking frittata style dish and I had to get that. But first I saw \"Scone with clotted cream and jam.\" I bounced at the idea of that, since I love European baked goods and the fact it came with clotted cream was epic! Well my waitress suggests to NOT heat the scone because the cream get gross on top. On top? Cream is not on the side as traditionally served I asked? No she said. Okay so I took her suggestion. Scone comes, with no clotted cream and jam, it's triangular and flat, and has a hard glaze over it. Ummmm wtf? This is zero like any scones with clotted cream and jam. So I try it and my fork almost broke off. Hard as a rock. Literally. I could throw this against the wall. I tell the waitress how this has no cream or jam and is hard as a rock and I want to trade out. She's confused. Says she can bring me cream cheese and jam. What?! That's NOT clotted cream. So now my dreams of a warm scone and clotted cream, which if you're wondering at this point what that is, we'll it's divine. Like a smooth, spreadable slightly sweetened marriage of whipped cream and butter. Usually served cold next to a warm scone. So now you can see why I'm so bummed. I ask for a chocolate croissant because now I'm really wanting to feed my pastry hankering and if a restaurant is going to have a display case of great pastries, well I'm trying. She brings out and then, only then, offers to warm it. Uhh ya, who doesn't want a warm pastry? It returns warm and I try to stick my fork in and yet again, stale, hard, gross. WHYYYYYY?????? You are offering such great pastries on your menu but they've been refrigerated and hard as rocks?! Then they are served nothing as described on the menu? Come on. Okay that was just the appetizer which at this point I've eaten neither. My dish comes out and is served with a small side salad which I like and can identify the yummy raspberry dressing from a local grocery store. Definitely not homemade. So that's three things I've eaten now that are clearly not freshly made at this restaurant. So what is made there? I go to eat my quiche/ frittata dish and hmmm, damn....no luck here. The egg is just straight up mush. Like full of liquid and I'm worried it's not even edible. I'm so hungry though and the favors are good, but the texture is just soooooo gross. Like not fully cooked. I completely struck out and will never return. Such a bummer because it seemed so cute and had a chic menu. They really gotta hit the drawing boards again before serving another dish.",

I have to met that that's something I have never liked when the person serving your food has lips or nose piercings. The kid came back with a picture of water and two glasses however one of the classes had pink lipstick on it. I got a blueberry pancakes which were average but my girlfriend hated her breakfast.  In their defense the manager/owner did come up to our table and asked how our meal was. We just said it was OK because we are not the type to complain we just write an honest review on yelp and never come back again. I'm just going to say that there are many other places to eat breakfast that are much better than this one as far as service and food quality. Won't be coming back",

This place won my heart over and I forgive the server due to my serving background and will still receive a nice tip . The food was incredible though...maybe worth the wait? You decide!

Instead I found the dirty fork, at first glance it looked super fancy inside, but really they just cleaned up well and chose an exquisite color scheme, along with their decorative lights, and their succulents chilling in a vase on each table. I ask for a menu before I sit down, the menu had much to offer, I was honestly quite surprised, I was expecting to see overpriced classic breakfast dishes, like $15 for your typical pancakes sausage eggs and bacon this was not the case here. The menu consisted of what one would say \"exotic\" dishes. Lox on toast, Hawaiian bread toast with coconut syrup and guava or passion fruit cream cheese! They had this dish called the madame which is what I got, it was a surplus amount of ham and cheese, a spread of some mustard, and more Swiss cheese oozed on top of the sandwich and then finished with an Egg over easy as the cherry on top! The taste was absolutely indescribable, my partner had ordered the jade toast with the guava cream cheese, and I almost couldn't tell if this was breakfast or dessert for breakfast executed with perfection. The presentation, really made it difficult to want to desecrate such a beautiful piece of work. The best part was that it's all organic food, I'm sick of all these lard factories we call breakfast diners. If there's any place you want to treat someone to for breakfast, or just eat right, it's here.",

Basically the server equivalent of \"not my fault and not my problem\". Would have been manageable if the omelet had been good but it clearly wasn't mixed well since some parts had too much flavor and other parts were extremely bland. No in between. Tried to enjoy the toast since my omelet wasn't good but my first bite, I cut my gum on the rock-hard crust. Fabulous. I'll deal with sub par food or bad service but both? No thanks.",

    "text": "Horrible experience . I messaged the owner prior to writing this review and they didn't even bother to apologize for the bad experience at their restaurant. So here I am spilling the truth about this place based on my own experience. I bought a groupon for this place and was excited to try a new hip neighborhood eatery so I came there with my family one morning. We stood up at the door waiting for a waiter or a host but after waiting a good 7 minutes, we tried to get one of the waiter to help us but they were too busy running around serving others. Tables were dirty, this place is understaffed. We then decided to take a long table by the door but a mean looking lady at the cashier just yelled at us and said \"give us a moment\". A moment? We've been standing infront of her for now about 15 minutes and that's the respond we'll get? And still no waiter or waitress attending us. The excitement went out the window when we waited for so long for service so we got up and we all left to go to another breakfast joint.   Like I said I messaged this place on Instagram messaging hoping to be able to help improve their service but I was ignored. ( made me feel like I was on the wrong for giving my concern) No reply, no apology, no thank you for letting us know either.  If I can do a zero star that's well deserved for this place!",

    "text": "NO \"Aloha Spirit\" in this establishment whatsoever.... I will never return!  1) Walking in, no one greeted us. Not even a smile nothing, it took awhile for someone to notice, it was not until we were about to walk out they acknowledged us. Service sucks! Especially Fatih, the misogynistic fool aka manager.  2) The chicken panini's bread tasted stale & literally had only 3 small strips of chicken. 3) Hawaiian French toast was sad. The \"guava cream cheese\" literally was a teaspoon of flavorless junk. Bread tasted like it was re-microwaved & the fruit tasted overripe, overall totally dissatisfied with the food. .... totally dissatisfied, with absolutely everything the food & service, took one bite & we were done and decided to pack the food To Go .  .... we returned from our car to find out they did not give us the coconut syrup rather they gave us regular syrup.. so we requested for some coconut syrup.. here's where it becomes good. This arrogant, chunky, misogynistic fool starts yelling at us, saying that he's the manager/cook FATIH & that he did in fact place coconut syrup in our order. There was another worker in the back that told him that he in fact put maple & basically told him to shut up. At this point, we were heated, he literally started YELLING at us basically saying he's right & we are wrong. Now, we are just disgruntled & kindly asked for a refund, & returned the food. Now this misogynistic fool, FATIH starts yelling & saying NO REFUND (like an angry bulldog) & that only the owner can approve it. After arguing, his pettiness, on a business card, writes a note with the amount of the toast for \"store credit\". Now, I ask him for a # to call the owner... he gives me the same # on his card. Turns out the customer outside told us that him & his wife owns the place & and that customer ended up leaving as well.   As someone who's entire family is from Hawaii, this has place NO aloha spirit whatsoever. Worst customer service EVER.",

    "text": "Awesome Turkish/Hawaiian fusion place. We had Breakfast Sammie (croissant with bacon and egg) and Special Breakfast (Hawaiian French toast with scrambled egg in a hole and fried chicken topped with syrup). Both were excellent and felt light even though the description doesn't necessarily suggest that. The latte was perfect - medium roast well ground coffee without much bitterness and perfectly frothed milk on top with lightly sweet tasting foam. Dessert... This was the best part of the morning. Tiramisu is easy top 3 I ever had. Firm bottom cake not too coffee and not too wet. Topped with a very firm cream/custard and cocoa powder, all made in house. Canoli - not overly sweet with firm outer shell and soft and delicious cream filling with chocolate bits. Macaroons were dense outer shell and soft filling, chocolate and strawberry (one of each).  Head chef Fathi (SP?) Is Turkish, a very cool guy and very personable. His wife is Hawaiian hence the fusion. He promised to have a more fully featured Turkish menu for dinner over the coming weeks.   We will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "Update: I came to pickup my cash for the incorrect credit charge and even though the owner said the money would be there for me in an envelope, I was NOT shocked to discover that he did not leave the money for me, I expected this to be an annoying process based on my previous dealings with this guy. When I arrived I let the server know that the owner was leaving money for me, she asked if I was Michael and I said yes (side note, this woman is super unpleasant). She told me to give her a minute while she takes care of a table and that was fine. After a few minutes she told me that the owner told her to call him when I showed up. So, I waited about 10 more minutes while she talked to the owner on the phone and wrote out a note. She came over and handed me the note and money and asked me to sign, I did and left. This dude has poor judgement through and through. How about pulling the cash and leaving it in an envelope like you said you were going to do instead of pawning it off on an hourly employee? Why would you make her do the work when YOU said you would would do it? This guy doesn't deserve to have employees, he's not cool.",

The coffee is mediocre at best usually don't get it unless I haven't had any yet and need some. The orders do take awhile if they get busy to come out which I think is due to the one chef.   So this was bad awhile go but not up and down. So originally they had some pretty terrible servers but seems like they have hired some new ones which are better, but depending on who's there that day serving can be a bit slow to refill drinks and check on you.",

However it's her demeanor that made the whole experience horrible!! She yells it out like we should of known better -  kind of attitude lol. We still decided to stay and try to enjoy breakfast. The orange juice that was ordered before breakfast came after we were done eating...the food was ok I guess, not sure I understood the concept. Plus my eggs were way too runny.

We got there and there was two tables waiting for food which was okay we saw there was only one host and one cook and we are understanding people we aren't picky. About 10 mins in the host finally comes over and asks for our drinks our coffee takes another 10 minutes for us to get them another 15 to take our order the host severed the table that came AFTER US. I saw it but I didn't pay to much mind to it we continued I finally got my food my friend still waiting another 10 mins my friend had ordered two things one was the acai bowl the host comes over and let's us know that the machine isn't working and that she wasn't going to be able to be able to make it anymore my friend said okay whatever doesn't matter we continue on with our lunch than later she comes back with it she was like I tried the best that I could without the machine but don't worry we will take it off the tab we said okay fine. We both finally got our food. The owner came over and let us know that he apologizes for the delay and offers to give us one macaroon each ... like okay ??? So than the host comes back with our check finally and she goes and rambles about how the owner got mad at her because she took the acai bowl off the check ... she kept repeating the same thing over to us and just basically talking crap about the owner very unprofessional. This was the worst experience I've had in a long time.",

The Acai bowl was loaded with fruit and it was solid.  We've tried a lot of other bowls in the area and most of them were a disappointment.  The French Kiss Crepes were amazing.  Fresh cut fruits and the crepes were well prepared and tasty.  We will definitely come back to try the HI style plates.",

I had the Vegas Style Avacado Toast topped with amazing. Fresh smoked salmon and a side of fruits/ berries. Great atmosphere. Calm. Gentle. Clean bathrooms and just an over all pleasant experience. Tables outside for outdoor seating. Pet dogs welcomed (they're greeted with doggy treats and a fresh water bowl).   Service was very pleasant, food was DELICIOUS. The owner himself walks around making sure all customers are good. She had the French toast which I had to try then confiscated the last few bites off her plate. Happy to see their accepted and listed on food delivery apps locally. I'm definitely making this place part of my healthy eating lifestyle.",

    "text": "Filthy Fork.  I don't want to, and I don't like to give poor reviews to establishments. But at the same time, consumers, customers, and people must be warned and aware of the experiences we have when we spend our hard earned money.  We were Seated and greeted promptly with no problem. But then the server proceeded with bare hands to pick up trash off the floor, along with some dirty dishes off a table all wearing no gloves. I watched the server then go grab drinks for a table, deliver the drinks to the table in front of us, and then come back to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. I was a little grossed out quickly from the picking up of items on the floor.  Scrambled eggs, chicken and waffles, that's what we ordered, simple. The chicken and waffles had a long large gross black hair on the plate, but not touching the food. It was absolutely disgusting, but I wanted to be mature, showed the hair to my girlfriend, and attempted to eat the meal because it wasn't touching any food, it was on the edge of my dish. How the cook and the waitress didn't see it is beyond me. The chicken was fatty, over cooked, and mostly fat and breading. The waffles were tasteless, and I was given no syrup, and there wasn't any of the table nor any offered to me. The dish came with ranch dressing that was watery and useless.  My girlfriend was upset because she was mad I didn't return the dish with the hair for starters. But to make matters worse her eggs were over cooked and had that burnt brown bottom all over her eggs. Pathetic. Either the cook had the burners too high, the pan too hot, the oil too hot, forgot about the eggs cooking, or just flat out didn't look or care while he cooked one side of the eggs.  The worst part about this entire experience was the waitress had about 4-5 tables as we paid the check and left. Someone who either owned the restaurant or managed the restaurant was sitting his fat ass down in the corner from the time we arrived to the time we left. He never moved a muscle to help the waitress with anything, as if he was above that or it wasn't his job as the owner or manager. How this place has a positive rating is beyond me. Perhaps they just had a horrible horrible hour of cooking, service, & laziness? But we won't ever return nor recommend.",

    "text": "I honestly hate writing negative reviews.  I came here when they first opened with my boyfriend & got the Vegas style toast which was good (obviously multigrain toast, avocado, smoked salmon how could you go wrong?). The only thing I didn't care for was the yogurt on the bottom on the plate but NBD  We then went a second time & I decided to get the Dirty Fork Lunch Special without pico de gallo and replaced the bread to multigrain.  Absolutely loved it.     3rd time I went was with a girlfriend & I got the same Dirty Fork Lunch Special with my alterations.  The 4th and last time I went.  I had my boyfriend order since he arrived before me and I told him the vegas toast with no pico de gallo and multigrain toast.  But I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special & mixed it up.  So I received the Vegas style toast no pico de gallo (it doesn't originally have pico)  I'm aware that the order wasn't correct (honest mistake) but I do feel like the waitress should've known that the Vegas toast didn't have pico de gallo and maybe clarified that that was the correct order if she knowingly knew the Vegas toast had no pico.  When I tried to tell her I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special she said \"no problem let me try to alter it\".  THEN shortly came back and said she couldn't alter it and they would make the correct one.  THEN she came back again and told me I would get charged for both plates.    It's disappointing when you go to a business when they first open & then they start to be \"cheap\" & not accommodate.  The owner has even recognized me the first 3 times prior.  I liked going here because the food was decent and close by to work.  They're over priced for the amount of food you get, I won't be coming back.  Take care of your customers & customer service determines if people will come back.  Which from the looks of it you guys have lost a few people from your service.",

It's currently 108 degrees and there is no working air conditioning, after waiting for about 20 min for our waitress to come, she mentions how she forgot the water and says she'll bring it later and commences to ask our orders. We put in the order, finally get water about 20 more minutes after. After deciding it was too hot to dine in, we asked for the order to go. Once we got home ready to eat, we realize 2/5 of the orders we got were correct, and we were missing 2 others. Out of 7 different orders, two were correct. We called and mentioned the missing items and they responded indifferently saying it'll be ready in 10, with no apology. Definitely won't be returning.",

We had to wait almost 30 minutes for our food. I don't see what takes so long to make pancakes and avocado toast. The food wasn't bad just nothing exciting.

Waitress was friendly but not efficient. She took my boyfriends drink order and delivered his drink promptly but then left the table without taking our drink order . When she came back she took my and my oldest daughter drink order but left without taking my other daughter's order lol. She came back and I asked if she could get my daughter a drink . She dropped off my daughters drink and left again without asking if we were ready to order which we were . How many trips to the table is that ? Anyway , it gets better. I ordered scrambled eggs and turkey bacon . Nope they were out of turkey bacon. Then I asked for potatoes instead of greens . Nope they don't have it. Okay a side a fruit then. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast that comes with salmon. Nope ! No salmon . Finally my daughter order a panini . Take took our order and left but in a few minutes she came saying they were out of panini bread. Wait! What ? Is this a joke ? We finally decided to leave and cancel our order. Very nicely we asked for the check . They apologize and proceeded to charge us for the drinks. Really ? They shouldn't have ! It's taking a while for her to come back so my boyfriend approached her and asked if everything was okay and her responses was \"you're just gonna have to wait !\" Wow  Do I need to say more ?",

Completely enjoyed the meals I've consumed here so far.  Still love the interior of this place.    High tens to the new server.  He's still learning.  (You'll get it quick.)  Gave us huge smiles when we asked for honey and we got the gigantic bottle.    Highly recommend the breakfast special for salmon lovers.  Oh and the black coffee!  What is it?!  Nice robust and aromatic!",

It's a small place, maybe 15 or so tables. Very clean and well decorated. My friend and I sat down and ordered our drinks, coffee for me and water for him. Both of these cups were never empty. They even bring a fancy bottle with water for your table...nice touch!  Service was excellent. Maybe because it wasn't crowded, but our server took his time and let us check out the menu, answered all questions with accuracy and knowledge, and did a great job. No complaint here.  On to the food. I had the 9th island French Toast, my friend the Dirty Fork breakfast special, which was chicken and eggs on top of french toast. Both were well cooked, and delicious. Coconut, passionfruit or guava syrup. Very enjoyable meal!  I'd come back, as would my friend. Prices were very fair, I think $11.95 for the French Toast.",

As we're waiting, I had to ask the server to refill my drink; that's a pet peeve of mine. She comes back with the French toast. I pause because I was about to remind her, but I just couldn't hold it. She responded with, \"oh, sorry. Well, it's gonna get busy, so this is better\". In disbelief of her response, I just nod and start serving myself (apparently I'm in a rush!?).  She comes back with my drink and the panini. I set aside the French toast and start with the salad. The dressing was really good. The panini was good, but nothing special. By the time I got to the French toast, it was cold. And you know how sad French toast is. Any way, I don't think I'll be having a repeat visit.  Now, if you're down for diner-like venues, like Hawaii faire, and wanna try something new, in the area? You can try it out. If you want ono Hawaiian brunch, there's always Cinnamon's.",

The Breakfast Special (riffing on chicken and waffles) and their Lunch Special (with salmon!) are unique options that have several flavors and textures to prevent food FOMO. If you're into sweets, get a side of their guava cream cheese, which was the tastiest version I've come across! Prices are a couple bucks higher than warranted but the food itself is solid. Avoid the acai and yogurt bowls.   Bring a friend to catch up with because, as other reviews mention, this place runs on island time and lengthy wait times are typical. On two different visits, there was just one lady serving as hostess, server, food runner, and busser, which is a bit much for any one person but especially difficult during their busier weekend hours. Check for a Groupon or Yelp deal before visiting to knock off a couple bucks.",

We both absolutely demolished our plates - it was amazing. I'd definitely eat it again.

    "text": "The food gets 4 stars for me. It's a good solid breakfast and different from the many breakfast spots in Vegas, but really nothing special in comparison to the incredible brunch spots Los Angeles has to offer. I would say the uniqueness is on the higher end of the Las Vegas scale but dead center average on a Los Angeles scale.  The thing that stood out the most about this restaurant is the timing. It took quite some time to get our order in (15 min), 30 min from the time of ordering to get our coffees, an additional 15 min to get our food (45 min from the time of ordering), then an additional 5 min to get our silverware to actually enjoy the food sitting in front of us.    The problem with this restaurant is not lack of staff, but rather lack of organization and structure. Breakfast is not a hard meal to prepare and is rather quick. Maybe they don't have their routine in place or methods of handling a full restaurant but something needs to change in this restaurant.  At this point, although the food was good, I do not think I'll be coming in for a sit down meal anytime soon.",

I called the restaurant to see what the status was, and all they said is that \"they're leaving soon and it's on it's way.\" Normally I'm super super nice about things and never complain because I know the restaurant business is rough. But, I would've liked for them to be more courteous. I hope that when the food gets here it's worth the wait. :(  Update: When the food got here, it was actually a really great burger. I'm sure the restaurant was busy today, and I have a feeling they might have just forgot our order amongst their pickups, and dine-ins. The delivery man was apologetic when he brought the food so that was nice.",

They claimed they only have one cook but first of all, this is an excuse as it's not the customers problem and they kept taking in customers which they couldn't afford to help. Obviously the owner wasn't experienced in the business as he would try to seat 4 people when he wasn't even getting the table ready for them. A piece of advice: leave plenty of time for the wait.",

Not only did our food come out after 45 minutes but my order didn't come out until they were done eating. Then, only half of my order was completed. For a restaurant that relies on word of mouth advertising, they need to get this customer service part down. Both the waiter and Manager did tell us how they only had two cooks and stated the next time I come in, I can get a free cup of coffee. The food was good but they have a long way to go. I don't think I'll be grabbing that cup of coffee anytime soon.",

After seeing their pics I told them I'd be by on the weekend to try it. I was pretty excited and invited a few friends. Food was pretty decent but made wrong. I did order the omelette as a scramble and they failed to put swiss cheese in it or avocado as the menu stated. My friend ordered the lunch special....he got handed the breakfast special instead. He just ate it anyway. Thought it was decent. The place was uncomfortably hot and we had to ask for ice in the room temp water. Come on.  It's summer in vegas guys! Overall for the price and the wrong orders I doubt I'll be coming back. To top it off... they didn't honor the voucher they sent me. Even though through messaging me I said I'd be there on the weekend and the voucher said nothing about weekdays only.  Our server even tried calling the owner but they said no.  There are too many other breakfast/brunch choices with comfortable temps who get the order right to pay these prices. Not to mention the terrible customer service by the owner for not honoring the voucher. Thanks anyway Dirty Fork.",

They have a better breakfast menu than some places, but they didn't have what I wanted off the menu today which was the veggie sausage- were kosher so sometimes it's easier to eat vegetarian than to eat anything with meat. So I was also disappointed to find the only quiche they have here has bacon. I got steak and eggs and so the eggs wouldn't be cooked in butter I got them poached which I was happy they had that option even. I liked how the steak was served- they sliced it so it wasn't too hard to cut into bite size pieces. My husband got the avocado toast with lox which he liked but was still hungry after eating, so he got a chocolate danish. Over all good place- they just need to up their choices for vegetarians (kosher eaters alike) and get a proper latte machine. Also they should serve a homemade dressing for their salads perhaps, just an idea most French bistros and bakeries do this. I might be back not sure.",

This also happened to the table behind 3 of the 4 people got their food and the 4th guy had to watch everyone eat until the cook decided to finish the order.

Plus garnishes like tomatoes be served on the side because that also makes it a bit soggy.   I did enjoy the latte that was delivered. It was still hot and delicious.

    "text": "I like what I like what I like. My better half raved about Dirty Fork so we decided to do breakfast at this place. My husband is into looking up new breakfast places and trying them out, supporting local businesses instead of the big chains.   1. Seating - We wanted to sit in a 4-seater table (at least 2-3 tables available) but we were advised that they liked to reserve that for big parties, fair enough. 20 minutes passed by and no big party that came.   2. Drinks - The person who sat us got our drink orders but it took them forever to get me a regular cup of coffee and they had no half-and-half which I found weird but ok.   3. Order - It took about 20 minutes as well for them to come in and get our orders. I asked for crispy Belgian waffle, side of scrambled eggs with cheese, and a side of crispy bacon. My husband ordered avocado toast. This took more than 30 minutes and i noticed a couple who sat by the bar and who came in after us get their order first. The manager/owner came up to our table and said he was going to give us free dessert 'on the house,' because of the wait and apologized profusely. When my order came, it was a waffle with fruits and whipped cream. I asked our server if it normally came with fruit and he said, he wasn't going to charge me for the fruit and the cook was new and 'hooked me up.' Though it is normally nice to be 'hooked up,' please do not mess with my breakfast. Needless to say, my waffle wasn't crispy as it was doused in maple syrup, my eggs didn't have cheese and my bacon was not crispy. My husband's avocado toast, he was happy with though he found it weird there was yogurt on the plate of his avocado toast. I really don't understand how people can eff up breakfast food. What really got me was if I didn't ask about the fruit on my waffles, it appears they wouldn't have said anything about getting my order wrong. I like what I like what I like.   4. Dessert - As for the promised dessert on the house, it never came. We asked for the bill and the manager/owner was nowhere to be found. I didn't ask for it as I just wanted to go.   5. Seating, part 2 - A family of 5 came while we were in the midst of eating but other than that no other big party came. I told my husband (and this is going to sound so obnoxious), if by 10-ish, you don't have a list of people to be seated, I highly doubt you're going to fill your dining floor. We have been to too many breakfast places on Sunday to know this.   6. Price - OVERPRICED.   7. Service - We are not above tipping (up to 50%) if we get exceptional service. Sadly, this is not the case.   My husband thinks we should come back and give it a try in 6 months, I nixed it.",

He enjoyed watching the cooks in the kitchen perform their cooking skills. We decided to both go on Sunday and sat at a table.  There were about 5 tables looking at the menu and only one waitress.  My husband remarked that the cooks were not the same as when he was there. We ordered a fruit plate that was just about so-so.  My husband ordered 2 eggs with hash browns, sausage with whole wheat toast.  My husband felt it did not compare to his first visit in taste and quality.  I ordered the omelet with hash browns and rye toast. I could not believe the amount of salt they used.  I could not eat the hash browns and only tasted the omelet.  I gave some to my husband who isn't as particular as I am to over salting foods. So my breakfast consisted of one slice of rye bread.  The waitress asked when she brought the check if everything was okay. I told her about the salt problem and she said she would let the cooks know. So not a good experience . I purchased a groupon we will return on a weekday only and be careful on what we order.  The bill with tip and no drinks was 35.00.",

They need to realize not everyone is looking for mixed greens with their eggs, I would actually pay a premium to keep the mixed greens off my eggs.

    "text": "Take this from a former server!!! Server was extremely friendly. Other than that, not impressed at all. Food was mediocre at best. Turkey Sammy was made without sprouts(check the menu), we weren't given side options, just French fries, and the dirty fork breakfast was disappointing. There was hardly any chicken on it, and the chicken was all breading anyways! French toast wasn't crispy, I cut through it like it was butter. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous for what you get. They will try to sell you higher because they use \"some\" better ingredients then most places, but the quality doesn't add up. Will not be coming back.",

The menu I loved lots of healthy choices even organic options.  Very clean friendly environment. Right across the street from Desert Breeze park makes it nice to go to park with kids and or dogs then have breakfast or lunch.",

I'm so happy I said yes to coming here for breakfast this morning. Also the customer service was amazing. We got checked up on many times during my visit. Nonetheless, the place is very clean and well taken care of. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This was our second time to the Dirty Fork and if I didn't have a Groupon it would have been our last. We were seated,never asked what we wanted to drink ,waited for 10 minutes without a return by the sole server in the restaurant yet two tables were seated after us were served drinks. Pitiful.  My mom even went up to the counter to try and get someone one to wait on us and that did nothing. We ended up leaving and going to Norm's diner just down the street where we were seated promptly,drink orders taken immediately and a server over a few minutes to take our order. Much better experience there than the dirty fork.  If I didn't want to lose my money on a Groupon I wouldn't go back. The management needs to get a much better system in place and more staff on hand. If not it's going to be the same thing over and over again.",

I ordered the 9th Island French Toast. The menu stated it came with coconut syrup. When my order arrived, there was not one drop of syrup. When I inquired about the syrup, the waitress told me that I could just use the regular syrup. I told her that's not what the menu stated and I would like the coconut syrup as stated. She said she would check with the back. At that time I requested the manager and all he could say that the waitress should know the menu. He did ended up complimenting us bread pudding for dessert but I was already upset with the service I was close to walking out. Btw if you purchase a Groupon, they charge you a separate tax.",
