For $20 I got 5 pieces of a volcano roll, the rice was over cooked and DONT RELY ON THOSE YELP REVIEW PICTURES, it was far from it and I was very disappointed. Might I mention I am a sushi addict and get it once a week!! NOT to mention the host and the bartender were very rude, they acted like that didn't have time for you and were very short! I am the kind of person that always says please and thank you and both those women just stared back at me with no response! I'm from LA and come to Vegas at least 4-5 times a year, I will not be recommending this place to anyone or be coming back.",

The performances happen every 15 minutes or so and the the wait staff sing and dance throughout the restaurant, in between tables and aisles.  They also pick out people to dance with them. So, if that's not your thing you may want to skip this place. As for the food and drinks, we ordered sake and different hand rolls. All visually beautiful and delicious. It was a very fun atmosphere, perfect place to visit when in Vegas!",

My sister and I went here for dinner before we went to a concert at the T-mobile arena. The sushi was fresh and delicious, a little pricey thought, bit still good! The rolls we got were around $18.00 a roll. Then there was dining and entertainment. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.   The reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hostesses definitely need to get their s**t together. We had a reservation, but still had wait 15 minutes to be seated even though the place was practically empty as we were wait my.",

I used to always get honey toast from Ichiza, but Sake Rok's really is better. The cubed brioche inside with butter, cinnamon and honey, with their vanilla custard is unreal. Save room for it.  And, having grown up on N'sync and Backstreet Boys, I personally love the throwback performances the staff does. *Pro tip* Park in the parking garage of the Monte Carlo and scan Nevada ID (or borrow a friend's!) to get free parking!

They even wanted us to interrupt the President and CEO of our company while they were handing out awards on stage to try and get the credit card.

We kindly and calmly asked she take one off the bill as we only had one cocktail glass to prove it. She seemed intoxicated and extremely rude. We asked for the manager who then proceeded to be defensive instead of hearing us out as a manager should. I will never be coming here again.   Overpriced food and drinks. Drunk servers. Horrible management. Go somewhere else when in Vegas.",

Everything tasted fresh fresh, and the presentation was exquisite. This place also reminded me how much fun sake bombs could be.   Definitely plan to be there for a couple of hours because you might just be there for food, but you'll end up staying for the entertainment.

And if the portion is going to be tiny, at least give you enough rice under the fish. So small of rice portion that the sushi fell apart before you stick it in your mouth. Come on, it rice! Where's the beef???",

I can't remember all the rolls, but the one that stood out was the \"El Chapo\" roll. Thin sliced lemon, shrimp, and a hint of cumin, or at least I thought that's what it tasted like. The place is hispter'ish with dim lighting. Hostess were very nice, the waiter not so much, otherwise this place would have received five stars. All in all, really great sushi!",

    "text": "Had a friends bachelorette dinner there on Saturday! My sister found them listed as a inexpensive place and had good reviews for sushi so we thought it'd make a great spot to celebrate! We walked in and it was amazing, we were not disappointed! They had a host who walked among the tables, his crazy hair and make up but he is the entertainment. He was fun and light spirited! Made our table of girls laugh and dance. The servers all danced and participated in choreography to the most amazing songs! Our server was amazing she was sweet and took her time with us. There was always someone refilling our drinks taking away plates without us asking for anything. I don't really eat sushi too much, so it was a bit of a struggle for me to eat here. But I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and it was delicious. I tried a tempura roll that had salmon but it wasn't my kind of dish, I'm not a seafood person but the rest of the table enjoyed everything we ate. We ordered a shareable punch called the Pink Pagoda and it was amazing, we shared it amongst the ladies. It came in a huge fish bowl bucket to drink. We also tried the Godzilla platter it took alittle longer to make (definitely expensive) but the Waggu was amazing, it was uber delicious and should be shared, literally 42 oz of meat! I wish I remembered our servers name she took such amazing care of us. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's fun, it's great energy, the staff and host were amazing. The food was good... the drinks were bomb. We couldn't have enjoyed ourselves any better than we did there. And they take reservations for parties.",

First of 5 stars for the environment. It's fun, it's loud, they have great music playing, and the workers there seem to really enjoy their jobs. However, upon arrival we were sat and given a large table sized menu, not complaining it was just different, but then we had to wait awhile before we finally flagged someone down to take our order. A different server finally came and started explaining some of the menu items after we gave our order. And finally a third server came around to us and nearing the end of our meal to check up on us and was super friendly and attentive so kudos to him. Definitely giving the food 5 stars though. Little on pricier side but definitely worth it.",

It looked empty but as we walked inside the place was packed.   There's a DJ playing great music that was perfect for a hip upbeat environment. It's music you want to groove to. A mix of new & old school top 40. The staff randomly dances to Madonna, another to *NSYNC vs BSB. Me & the hubs had a really fun time eating amazing food & just a really fun environment.   We decided to order a bunch of small plates to share which was perfect so we could also get dessert.  Rok shrimp - little nuggets of shrimp friend in a light tempura batter then tossed in a spicy cream sauce. This was my favorite.   Karage chicken - lightly battered fried chicken nuggets served with a ginger ponzu sauce to dip in.   S&P shrimp - skewered fried shrimp fried & served with a creamy, I think cilantro sauce. Not a spicy as I was expecting.   Scallops - so tender & juicy & perfectly seared. I'm not sure what type of sauce/broth it was served with but it was delicious.   El Chappo roll - it was good but again it said spicy but was lacking that kick. I would try different roll next time.   Edemame Rok - spicy & refreshing bc of the lime/lemon seasoning.   Honey toast - the best thing they have. Cinnamon sugar crusted croutons, stuffed on a vanilla custard topped with fresh berries & vanilla ice cream. It reminded me of cream brulee, honey toast & captain crunch had a baby. I may go back just for this.   We had to get a sake bomb to join in on the sake Rok sake bomb fun. A nice draft Kirin was perfect pairing with the meal.",

Kamakizi (?) roll was also super good. The yellow tail sashimi just melts in your mouth.   Waiters and waitresses were all great and also great performers!

At first glance, I was confused because I thought we were walking into a nightclub. The music is loud but good and everyone is dressed to the nines. We were starving so willing to stay and see what happens.  We were promptly seated but not given menus. At first we weren't sure if it was a mistake but then I quickly noticed that the hostess wasn't giving anyone menus. After a couple of minutes, our waitress showed up with them and offered to answer any questions we had.   I ordered the Lily Pad, which was one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever had, so I ordered 2 of them. The drinks are pricey but worth every sip.  For my entree, I ordered the Tiger Roll. It had a subtle, crab/cucumber taste and then the heat from the spicy seasoning hit me. It was exactly what I wanted.   While we were eating and talking, the wait staff started singing and dancing, which was a great surprise!! They were dancing on a stage, on the bar, near the tables...they were everywhere. There was an awesome geisha who looked and sounded like Lady Gaga and she brought the house down. Seriously, she was awesome.   About 30 minutes later, they did another number. This time, our waitress was being carried in midair while doing a split. She was badass.  Sake Rok rocks!!! The only recommendation I have is giving the customers the menus once they're seated. Not doing so causes confusion and awkwardness.",

It is amongst a few eateries and just opposite T-mobile Arena, as such I have passed by a few times and wanted to try, so we decided there was no better time than my birthday! What I loved initially about Sake Rok is the people in it. You are made to feel special by staff from the offset and as I spent more time here throughout the evening, I found that it doesn't have to be a special occasion for you to be treated as a special guest. Staff really make this place a 5 star establishment and their care and hospitality make you feel welcomed and special. I especially enjoyed the host in costume who was very personable and skilled in his dance moves! Now the ambience. Sake Rok is open, clean and spacious and at the same time you don't feel that noise carries or that you can't hear your party amongst everyone else. The kitchen is open plan so you can see the chefs at work and your food throughout the process. The food itself is amazing!! We ordered a range of small plates and sides to share, kind of like a tapas. The highlights were the pork belly which was cooked perfectly and melt in the mouth, the Brussels sprouts were so good and the fries they even made to perfection with great seasoning! The drinks were also great and the Sake bombs were a fun little twist! From start to finish, our experience was fun, special and we all left happy and impressed. Will DEFINITELY return and I cannot wait for an excuse to try some more from their menu!",

    "text": "Beware!!!! They start the timer when you are seated and you have 1 hour for the AYCE. My wife and I arrived at Sake Rok at 3:45 pm on November 26th a few hours before our scheduled rock concert at T-MOBILE arena. After ordering a few appetizers and some rolls, and ONLY water, we waited a few minutes to find out server had pulled a Houdini act. Along comes another server who attempted to deliver alcoholic beverages to our table which we did not order. Our appetizers and rolls arrived about 15 minutes after the initial order. Another attempt was made to deliver food items which we did not order. I would like to note that there were four men who arrived about 10 min after we were seated and their drinks and food items were arriving in abundance. We all know how much profit their is in alcohol so I'm certain they prioritize orders for those who drink. By the time the server checks on us we were ready to place another order of rolls but were told our time limit of 1 hour was up and that she could probably deliver a desert item. We kindly rejected the offer. Definitely won't be going to Sake Rok again and will stick to Oyshi on either Rainbow or Sahara or many of the other less stingy places around the Vegas Valley.  Btw... I mentioned our experience to the manager on our way out and just looked at me for a second with a blank stare lol. She did muster up an \"I'm sorry\", however.",

    "text": "Whoa. If you like entertainment during dinner, this is it. I came here to order my food to go because it was near where I was staying. First time here. I ordered the pork belly and girl on the beach roll. I sat at the bar area while I waited for my food. The bartender was very nice and friendly. The interior looked great. Japanese theme. Love the art wall.   There was a staff member in a fun looking, drag costume. He's an MC for the restaurant. He came up to me and said hi. I saw him went up to a table and chatted with the customers at that table. All of sudden, he spoke into a microphone about fashion and then, music came on. The staff and the MC were dancing and singing to Psy Gangnam Style song. They ran up to the stage and ended their song. The music got cut off and everything went back to normal. Wow. I thought that was fun and funny. It made me smile. My wait for food was definitely entertaining and time went by.   Got my order and went back to my hotel room. Yuummm, the braised pork belly was off the hook. The fats melts in your mouth. It's so good. Recommend it. The sushi roll was small, but it did fill me up.   It was so good that I came back for the 2nd time during my stay and got the pork belly to go. I arrived near to closing time. I got my food and went back to my hotel room. This time, the pork belly was old and dry. It wasn't moist like my first time. I'm thinking they were out of pork belly and gave me the last scrap of what they had left. There were no fats at all. Just dry, lean meat. I was a bit disappointed. Lesson learned, do not come at closing time.   I still give it 4 stars due to my first experience. I would definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas.",

The location is nice if you are going to an event in the area. Most importantly the food is very good. I would recommend the Tiger Roll, that was my favorite roll. If you are lucky to be there on your Birthday,  you get a Sake bomb. Which is also entertaining to see. Great job with the food and great service. I will definitely go back when in Vegas.",

They have a signature drink which is smoked and the presentation was outstanding.   They have a variety of fried foods. I enjoyed their chicken karaage and shrimp on a skewer. Our sushi was the Godzilla platter which was ok. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Vegas.",

They have an AYCE sushi option at $25 and $35. I always go for $35 to get speciality rolls just so I can get 3 orders of the volcano roll! So good! Only downfall is that you can only order 3 items at a time, and the nigiri is 1 piece when you order. Best party no limit mochi! However the mochi melts really fast so, eat quick.",

    "text": "Another sushi spot on the strip. I don't know how some of these places make it but this newly opened sushi spot has created their own niche for sushi dining in sin city. If you are in the mood for a low key sushi spot where you can chat with the chefs or have an audible conversation at your table, then you better keep walking. Here you will find tons of entertainment. This Located in the Park, it is set in a perfect location outside of the new T-Mobile arena. We walked in about 10pm on Saturday night, closing time was posted at 10:30pm but I was told that they will stay open until the last person leaves.   At first, I wasn't 100% sold on it. It was extremely loud inside and they sat me right next to a large post that takes up a lot of space. It was like I was in trouble or something or they were trying to hide me from the place because of my looks. HAHA! Seriously, I would recommend they do something about that spot for patrons. It is not the most conducive place for eating or enjoying the overall experience of the restaurant. I guess I could have said something but I sucked it up and rolled with it. The service was a bit slow at first and it took a few minutes for our server to acknowledge us but it was probably because I was sitting behind a large post and they couldn't see my big head. I probably would have made this a 5-star spot but the post thing wasn't cool. After that the service was wonderful. The beer and cocktails kept coming.   We weren't too hungry but went with a few appetizers, agadashi tofu, shishito peppers, seaweed salad (delicious), mixed tempura (way overpriced for $18), and miso soup for the wifey. They do not have a lot of options for sushi/sashimi and be forewarned that the pieces are priced for 1 piece of sushi. One piece of uni is $8, etc. Not a big deal because it's Vegas where things are way overpriced and they know stupid people like me will pay for it. I had the sashimi platter (chef's choice, so not the best pieces but they were okay) for $40. It was decent. I would probably order again but I should have tried something different rather than the sushi since they have so many offerings. Overall, the food was good.   The entertainment is the main attraction here. The MC for the night goes around messing with people. Be careful because if you look shy you will most likely get called out. He will persuade you to dance and make a fool of yourself. Hey, it's Vegas so whatever happens there will stay there, so just let the inner fool out, you know it's hiding in there and has been dying to come out. There happened to be a Lakers/Warriors preseason game that just let out and the Laker girls came in to dine. Yeah! I'm a huge fan but my wife told me to leave them alone. The MC got them in on the action and a few of them danced on stage. It was cool.   Servers were nice and attentive (after they realized we were there). Food was good and drinks were great. We didn't order a huge meal or that many drinks and the bill was a little much, with tip it came out to $230. So if you are budget minded this is not your place. You are paying for the ambience and entertainment value. I probably won't try it again. FYI- the bathrooms are unisex. Have a great time and try it out. Happy eating!",

The music was loud and annoying sorta rap and the people walking around picking up plates were more attentive than the waiter. The sushi was more expensive and in smaller quantity, with the specialty sushi not being memorable. Same for their saki choices.  I guess for being a sports bar sushi joint it must have been ok, but that's not what I went for. Sorry",

    "text": "Tip: If you want high end sake (Kubota Manju, Onigoroshi, Kotzusumi, etc.) there is a bunch available off the menu.  Tip #2: Fish quality isn't great, so don't come here for the sushi.  This was a tough review, because Sake Rok does have two big positives: 1) Servers were attentive and really friendly; 2) Alcohol! Liquor selection is excellent, cocktail list is extensive with fun/quality options, and top shelf sake is available (although, as I mention above, off the menu).  The problem is that the food quality wasn't impressive. The fish quality was not good so I would avoid any sushi items here, and the non-sushi dishes were hit or miss. I really liked the tomahawk steak, the mushroom tobanyaki, the seared scallops, and the wagyu sliders. But OTOH I didn't like either the tuna or beef tataki, the shishito peppers were super oversalted, and the \"rok\" shrimp tempura and the shrimp/vegetable tempura weren't breaded that well (and both very small portion size). Also, I've been here twice but they were out of the honey toast dessert on both occasions. Bummer.  But I could see this spot possibly working out if you're mainly coming to have drinks and enjoy the atmosphere (music plays loudly here, and waitstaff will periodically perform in choreographed dance shows), and plan to have food as a side / secondary priority (or you have to stick with very specific items that you know are good). If food is at all the #1 priority, I think you'll be disappointed. And again, I'd avoid the sushi no matter what.  Given all the above, I think 1.5-2* for food, +1* for service and strong alcohol selection is fair.",

    "text": "When a bunch of us girls from NJ headed to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party, we were looking for something unique, fun, and different to add to our schedule of events. Sake Rok, in itself, delivers the fun-in-Vegas special experience, even despite the hiccups here and there.  I'll start with the good. The atmosphere of this place is fantastic. It's got an edgey, J-pop/punk vibe that screams at you from the street - literally! More about this in a below, but basically, whatever is going on inside is broadcasted outside, on the pavilion, of  the restaurant.   Keep in mind, Sake Rok is not a peaceful dining experience. It's an interactive, energy-fueled improv and music show that involves every person in the room, so don't come here expecting anything less. Our host for the evening (Carlos) was HYSTERICAL and downright delightful. His fashion sense slayed, his dancing was on-point, and his jokes had us all in stitches. And the best part? He gets to DRINK SAKE BOMBS WITH YOU. He leads you into the battle of staying sober and looks fabulous while doing so. Overall, Carlos gets all the gold stars.   Even the service was pretty wonderful, despite the multiple waiters and waitresses weighing on you. Usually, I hate it when restaurants have the many-waiters thing, but everyone had their act together, and was super pleasant and funny.  Buuuuuuut I will say this. I daresay people come to Sake Rok just for the show, because in my opinion, the food (at least from our one experience) will definitely not be getting me in the door again. It's not that the actual food tasted bad (the little we had was delicious), it's just the fine details of our overall eating experience that missed the mark.  First of all, this place is overpriced, YET I can get over that. You're in a touristy section of Vegas, and the dining comes with entertainment, so what do you expect? I can totally forgive the high price tag that comes with the meal. (Again, thank you Carlos.)  The menu items were, at the time that we went, extremely limited, but it seems that the menu has changed in the few months since I been there. (I actually went to look at the website so that I could glance menu to remind myself of the options, and was surprised at the plentiful and different items available. For example, the slider small plates that a party member ordered came with foie gras - a weird and completely unnecessary topping, even for a fancy Japanese place. It appears that they have taken it off the menu.) Basically, our options were sushi rolls (personally, not a fan), a weird combination of carb-and-fish based small plates (also not a fan), and expensive entree options. Let's get real here. The place wants to be bougie and offer unique dining options, I get that, but you HAVE GOT to appeal to the masses somehow, even if it's ONE kitschy 'plain' dish. Things like oysters, tuna tartare, and grilled octopus are all great 'different' options, but are way too specific to appeal multiple palettes. And I wasn't about to shell out 40 bucks for a hangar steak. But, having said this, the menu has clearly changed since I've been there, so don't base your opinion solely on this.  STILL! I can forgive all that, just for the entertainment factor and vibe of this place. The real gamechanger is this. The real issue is that the portions were so pathetically small that we all ended up getting trashed because there was very little food in our stomachs. For a restaurant that literally encourages you to drink Sake Bombs, something's gotta give. There's needs to be more drinker-friendly options (not just sushi rolls and dumplings the size of quarters) and more 'available' options, too. One does not drink with sushi alone. Basically, the miniscule portions and limited options combined with the high price made our experience so-so.   If I ever return to this Vegas, I will give it another chance based on the new menu that I see on the website and entertainment factor. The decor and atmosphere of this place alone is amazing! Don't get me wrong - everyone in our party had a blast, but the food situation just brought the experience down. You can't have these crazy drink options and not have food to go along with it, it just doesn't cut it.",

However, if you're looking for a huge meal and willing to spend a lot of money on it then go for it. Sake Rok has many small plates and little entrees that are a bit pricey and can add all up.   I would like to say that Sake Rok is a great pregame place to start your night off in Vegas. If you like pun filled drink names, some appetizing sushi and the staff dancing for you, then come here.",

The atmosphere was awesome, they had some Nsync and Backstreet Boys dance choreography going on which was great and they definitely kept their guests entertained. We had some delicious shrimp rolls and some other tasty stuff, all of which were great tasting.  So my friend and I were eating there before the concert next door and she had a little tiny purse on her, well when west odd up to leave, a 100.00 bill dropped out of her purse, hit the floor and we left (having no idea).  Well it turns out that our waiter (Keoki) thought he recalled seeing the 100.00 drop out of the purse and went over to grab it, well a guest saw it too and the guest took it themselves. Then the GM got involved and they looked at camera tape and did in fact see that my friend  dropped it, so they requested the guest give it back to them, so they did. They then contacted us via text letting her know what happened. BLOWN AWAY!!!!!!!! This kind of honesty is so hard to find nowadays! Hats off to you Sake Rok!!!!! After the concert was over we went back and she just said to keep the 100.00 because honesty like that is SO hard to find. What an awesome place and still just mind blown by that honest act!",

I want Sushi not salad, soup Potato's mashed and garlic bread Chief choice crap.  I want to pick my choice of Sashimi. Ohh yeah a fabulist $125 a person for mass produced catered food.  It's a sushi place do what you do.  Do SUSHI not bad wedding food and then bend us over for $125 a person.  The caller was pleasant and patient but as soon as I said I would cancel the reservation if I had to pay $125.  She Just hung up.  No we're sorry. No we apologize.

It's one of those places where everyone is having a great time and it's hard not to have a smile on your face.  Our server, Mike, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and sake list. He recommended some appetizers and answered all our questions about the sake list. I ordered the shishito peppers, edamame rok, and a bottle of sake to start off our dinner.  For entrees my wife and I split some rolls, rock shrimp, and the wagyu beef tataki. The wagyu had a great smoky flavor to it and the rolls were great as well. We really liked the rock shrimp. The shrimp were cooked with the perfect amount of tempura batter, and the sauce they came with was delicious. We will order this next time we go back.  Overall we had a great time and we really love the concept. We will definitely be back in again.",

I had finished my roll before the bartender ever came to check on me. I had to ask about the edamame, which came out after another ten minutes. The food was good, everything had a kick. Just terrible service. I can only imagine how bad the service is when the restaurant is full.

Our waiter showed up and basically did the minimum he could to get a tip. Again, he wasn't bad but wasn't really helpful or friendly either.   Overall, if was an ok experience but I probably wouldn't go back.",

Of course my fellow Yelpers never let me down because according to the stars this place was where we needed be. It's fairly new and the decor is out of this world gorgeous! It's so vegas inside with pops of red and the chairs are like ivory colored snake skin. We ordered like 3 specialty rolls that were dynamite! (Wish I remembered the names of them) the staff were all upbeat, friendly and very attentive! The music was POPPIN too. We went early in the day so it washer crowded but word on the street is that in the evening it gets jam packed and def a party atmosphere! I can't wait to go back to Vegas to get my sushi fix. Put it this way the sushi was SO good that I haven't had any since coming here in May 2016 because no other sushi place can compare!",

There is a host from Canada that is the soul and life of the place. He is so personable and charismatic and fun and really gets the fun rolling. Be sure to engage in the free sake bombs with him. I don't know how he keeps it up all night. The restaurant sang happy birthday to my friend and projected a sign on the wall. Be sure to let them know what you're celebrating and they'll make you feel special. Drinks are strong and delicious. My Kirin frozen head left much to be desired and maybe stick to rolls VS entrees as this is where they truly shine. The rolls are fantastic. Up with the best I've ever had. That honey toast as well. Order one for the table. You won't be able to stop eating it. Thank u sake rok. You made my friends birthday night and we will be back.",

    "text": "Sadly disappointed  I had been craving sushi all weekend and we seen this spot while walking the strip and it's new so why not try something new right ? Well wrong, I wanted this meal to be our final meal in Vegas and unfortunately the rolls were baby rolls and not very flavorful. I will be honest we did switch up one of the rolls a bit so maybe the original roll would have tasted better but either way it was beyond small I mean tiny !! The chefs have definitely perfected there craft on cutting the thinnest slices possible of avocado and the smallest crab meat put in the roll was less the than the size of my pinky finger and the rolls aren't cheap so you aren't paying for presentation because they come on a plain white serving tray and you aren't paying for quantity because they are so small so I could only assume your paying for the show that comes with the meal which we didn't get because we missed it by an hour and came too early. So I suggest coming when there is a show so you will at least get some entertainment. And please please please order your drink with no ice !! Because we paid $14 for a cup of ice with a flower and the taste was ok nothing spectacular! And the roll that we did change we still wanted shrimp just not spicy shrimp we mentioned possibly changing it to crap but opted not to and I guess the waiter didn't hear us because he still ordered it with crab and it was $5 more for something we didn't want  I'm not sure if the dj music was to loud and he didn't hear us or wasn't paying attention but either way paying more for something you don't want that didn't have the best of flavor was a True disappointment. The overall atmosphere of the place was nice with a decent amount of seating . It did take a while for the roll and the place wasn't packed at all so I'm not sure if they waited to make the rolls because someone in our party ordered the hanger steak and takes a while to make or they just take a long time to make the rolls because the have to prefect the art of making mini rolls lol either way not happy, make your own judgement and hopefully my tips will help you have a better experience! The hanger steak I was told that was delicious and that's what the stars are for. Maybe my review wouldn't have been so harsh if I seen the value in what we were buying but since there was no show and small amount of food it only lead to disappointment I wouldn't suggest that they offer free edamame or miso soup or for them to lower the prices to pre event meals .",

Great food, definitely quality over quantity type of food and a little price- but completely worth it for the show that you get with a yummy meal! Highly recommend and can't wait to go back!",

Right when you walk in, you can see the beautiful murals and fun staff that is all over the restaurant.  We sat on level one where the nice bar is on one side and the sushi bar is on the opposite side. There is also a DJ booth right in the middle of the restaurants.  The second floor has seats that looks down into the first floor with guests watching the show.  We had prime seating close the the center bar.    The wait staff was amazing and there is an \"MC\" that comes by all the table and chats with everybody to make sure you're enjoying the food and show.  He also takes sake bombs with the guests. (I can't believe how much this guy can drink!!)  Then food comes very quickly and its AMAZING!!!  The prawns, roasted chicken, sushi rolls, and drinks were out of this WORLD!!  So good.    My favorite is the Stuffed French Toast!!   All the girls I came with were so stuffed with food.  It was just so delicious!  BONUS: Plates get cleared away fast so you know service is fab here.  This is definitely an entertainment venue.  You're going to experience a fun and interactive setting.   If you're coming for a quiet dinner,you probably want to try something else or I'd ask for the 2nd level. This is definitely more of a night out with your girlfriends or a bachelor party for sure!!!",

Which is fine if that's what you are looking for (I'm in favor of a good party night out now and again!) or if you are on college spring break.  Any place that has all you can eat sushi deal with caveats so they can charge you more if you don't meet their requirements (such as not finish your plate) feels a bit scam-like to me.  My rolls were fine, but the same price as my visit to the sushi bar at Paris (which was 2x better in quality and taste).",

The only problem is I can't remember exactly what we ordered (we had appetizers, a Godzilla Platter and sashimi but we're with two other couples and we let them do the ordering). Either way, it was delicious, and we'll be back.   The entertainment was spot on, and a super fun flashback to my teenage years. I told my husband that it makes me want to work there (HA!).

Sake Rok was right across the street from our hotel so we sauntered over and it did not disappoint. Hubs let me order and we got more adventurous (for us)with each roll. Over the course of the evening we ordered the tiger, tempura, kamikaze, volcano and ronin - all of them fantastic. We also ordered a size of charred Brussels sprouts - holy crap, delicious. The drinks were also great (we had the dragonfly, a passionfruit martini, and the walk this way, which was whisky-based). We had four each so, yeah. The service was also on point - Nate was amazing. They also have a mistress of ceremonies of sorts who gets you really involved with singing, dancing, sake bombs, etc. All in all a great evening of sushi, drinks and fun. I also have my husband asking \"So when can we go to sushi again?\"",

It isn't like anything you've experienced before in a sushi restaurant. I really appreciated that as we walked in we were asked if there are any food allergies. For some one like me who has a long list of them, I see the positive of this feature. Also, customer assistance is very good. They're very aware of you, even with a crowd. It is a little loud, but it shouldn't be too much that you can't look past this small inconvenience.",

She gave me a suggestion for a different roll and man it was the best roll i have ever had! So not only was she super dope but she made sure to check on us and was just a pleasant server! Make sure when you go there ask for her because she will take care of you!! Thank you Sarah!",

    "text": "If you're looking for a trendy, hipster dining experience with above average Japanese food - this may be the place for you.   As mentioned in other reviews these folks really pride themselves on the entertainment factor with the dancing and singing etc so if you're looking for a unique experience I'd really suggest it because lots of people were having fun.   However it did seem to take away from the service delivery on the dining side:  We were seated by the Door was which was open on a chilly evening. We asked for the door to be closed or for us to be moved. We were told that the door couldn't be closed (?) but when they realized that they had reservations which prohibited from us being moved they finally closed the door. However at the end of the meal they opened the door again. We were close to the end of the meal so we didn't push the issue but the draft was pretty annoying.  Food comes out as its prepared. Bussers are  very quick to bus your table but they'd take EVERYTHING away so we'd have to ask for additional plates and silverware on a couple of occasions.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts which never arrived. When we asked at the end of the meal to make sure we weren't charged the server said they were still being cooked (over an hour at this point). We paid our bill and the server said the food was still coming even though we weren't being charged. We finished our drinks but after another 15 minutes we were done and still no Brussel sprouts so we left. Not that we were still hungry but still...   They push Sake bombs pretty hard at this place. I'm no prude by any means and have had more than a few in my day so when the emcee came over to introduce herself and starred pushing them I said we would buy a round if she joined us. She said that sounded awesome and would join us so I bought a round for the table and her. However when the shots came she made up an excuse as to why she couldn't take the shot. No big deal but because of the hard sell we felt like there was a bit of a bait and switch.  These things are all easily fixed and when they are this place will be a solid 4 if you're looking for that kind of vibe and experience. Until then a solid 3.",

    "text": "Sake Rok defies stuffy stereotypes about sushi places, and forgoes typical dinning etiquette to be a  hybrid of a restaurant, a comedy club, and a dance club.  With Pittbull's music blaring and club lights spinning from the DJ booth in the corner, we walked in at dining room at Sushi Rok (pronounced 'Rock\", like Rock and Roll, natch). We were seated quickly and a staff member came out to get our drink order. Our server soon followed to explain the menu, which includes traditional sushi roles, specialty rolls, and even steak- Because they are more than just sushi, our server explained.  More than sushi they are: someone that can only be described as a hype-man worked the room during our meal, moving table to table with a microphone to interview people and make jokey small talk. At one point he interrupted the dining room with his microphone to introduce a wacky \"How to do sakki bombs\" video, projected 10 feet up on the wall behind us. Then collectively as a restaurant we cheered on another table as they did their first sakki bomb drink.  Schtick aside, the food was good. With big appetites, my table of 4 ordered a mix of several traditional roles, specialty rolls, edamame, and seaweed salads. The presentation was nice and the rolls were all delicious with more than enough to go around. Because I like a value, I found our bill to be surprisingly reasonable for the amount of food and drinks. Not to mention, we got a dose of all the on-site entertainment swirling around us.  If you are looking for a traditional sushi place, this place won't appeal to you, but as a fun alternative, especially if you have a large group, this is a good dining option with a lot of Vegas flair.",

For appetizer, we got the Edamame Rok, I give it a 5 out of 10, definitely had better edamame elsewhere. For my entree I got the Volcano Roll. The food was good, but way too expensive. Some rolls cost over $20 for a single roll. I'd rather go somewhere off the strip, pay $5 more and get unlimited sushi! For big parties (we had 10 ppl) you can only split the bill 4 ways, so that definitely became a headache during checkout (plan accordingly, we didn't know). They also add a 22% service charge which I find ridiculous. I get it, this place is on the strip, it's going to be expensive, but bc of the ridiculous prices and unnecessary tip addition, we won't be back.",

Hostess asked if we could be done by 6:15 since they were totally booked for the night (it was 4:45 & we were a party of 2). We agreed and they sat us. After ordering drinks, the hostess asked to move us to another table and provided free sake bombs for the move. We would have moved either way but a very nice offer.  The atmosphere was very fun and had a ready to party feel about it. I bet if we went later in the evening we would have loved that about this place.  The food was on par with a regular sushi restaurant.  (REMEMBER that this location is on the LV strip so prices are almost doubled from a regular sushi place. You really are paying for location.) I tried the miso soup (5 stars), king crab California roll (3 stars / pretty average) and nigiri yellowtail (5 stars) and tuna (3stars/ too fatty). My husband, loved the shishito peppers (warning: seeds galore. Yes I know peppers have seeds but these peppers have A LOT of seeds). He also had a kamikaze roll (5 stars). They also had the freshest ginger I have had in the longest time for a sushi restaurant!  Service was decent. It was early opening for dinner, they were getting things organized and we were given 3 different servers in the hour we were there. All 3 of the servers were pleasant and helpful. But with so many changes in a short period, usually results in mistakes. The requirement for our seating was to be finished at a certain time, hard to do when it takes 15 minutes just to get water and our beers. The 2nd server introduced himself but didn't offer to take our food order, weird. Our first server came back around and gave us our free sake bombs, (that was a fun experience) and then took our food order (30 minutes after seating) My husband ordered a second beer when we received our food, which first was served to the table next to us, and came at the end of our meal. Then about 5 minutes later the bartender brought a 3rd beer that he didn't order. We sent it back because we were finished. A minute later he brought it back saying it was on the house. It wasn't! We were charged for it. For $12 a beer my husband ended up drinking it! We didn't want to wait for someone to come back around, change the check and wait awhile to see one of those 3 servers again.  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience. The food was about 4 stars, which is what matters most, service 3 stars (I'm chalking it up to opening time) and atmosphere was definitely 5 stars).",

    "text": "Love love the feel and vibe to this place!!! It is located on the strip next to New York New York (The Park area) Staff was super friendly and interactive with their customers  Taste: 3.5 stars- For appetizers we ordered the seaweed salad and pork belly. Both were fantastic. I thought the pork belly would be crispy but it was fatty and still yummy. We ordered 2 sushi rolls: rok and roll... and I can't seem to remember the other rolls name but it had eel, crab and some lemony foam thing on top of it. The sushis were such a disappointment. I thought the crab stuffing inside tasted very dry and old. Also, I didn't really like the foamy stuff it was topped with.  Price/portion: 3 stars- the plating and portion was okay. The plating could be much nicer in presentation for the pricing  Atmosphere: 5 stars- very hip, modern and nice vibe. Great selection of music and decor  Service: 5 stars- excellent, very welcoming and friendly  We would definitely come back to try something different off the menu... maybe their drinks too",

Both were bite-size, delicious, and perhaps more creative than the average roll. They had lots of options for people who can't hang with raw fish, but also saw many options for the more adventurous types. We also had the edamame Rok which made for a nice, flavorful appetizer (although showed up basically as dessert... don't know what happened there).   One thing I did find amusing is that they have a coed bathroom, and when I was washing my hands this guy came in and freaked out like he had unknowingly walked into the ladies' room. So, just a heads up in the event you decide to use the restroom after several sake shots and get disoriented.",

    "text": "We hosted a huge event here for 300 people and had pretty high expectations based on the reviews and other recommendations.  We were horribly disappointed. They gave each table tiny plates of food, which we all thought were appetizers.  People picked at it and tried not to take too much so that everyone would be able to eat some, only to find out that those were the entree and not the appetizers.  Not only were the portions tiny, the food was not good - especially given the price we paid.  When tables started to complain, they brought out a few more plates of food, only to tell us that they had cooked everything they had and wouldn't be able to feed us any more.  Needless to say, all 300 people were very unhappy and hungry. We ended up having to order pizzas. You would think that a restaurant venue would prepare themselves for a large group of people and have enough food on hand, but apparently quantity of food didn't cross their minds. They were aware of the menu we were choosing, and should have warned us if they had known ahead of time that it wouldn't be enough for THREE HUNDRED people.  The staff was unfriendly and had serious attitude, further frustrating our group. We tried to host an awards ceremony on the top floor which was even more horrifying than the meal (sounds impossible, but it's True). The space was small and dark and their sound system was HORRIBLE.  Their microphones were squealing and kept cutting out.  The owner, who was supposed to be in charge of the sound, was rude and dismissive and didn't seem to care that their system wasn't operating correctly. We had arrived an hour early to make sure that everything was set up, and they were nowhere to be found to solve the issue.   Sake Rok was a terrible choice and I would never recommend bringing a group of people here. This restaurant was a huge embarrassment.",

He said it was his first day, but he nailed every aspect of service! Plus, he's outgoing and silly. In fact the whole staff is just so lively and I love the fact that they interact with the guests.   Now to the honey toast. What makes it different are the honey glazed \"croutons\" in the honey toast. I never had anything like it. We devoured the whole thing in minutes and the best was last - the BOTTOM of the honey toast which was gooey and soaked with honey. I would come back just for this dessert!

    "text": "Our concierge recommended this place and we were excited to try it out. We were told the servers perform songs in between serving their tables and that sounded like a great time for dinner.   We arrived at 10:00pm and the place was pretty packed but they sat us right away. The decor was cool, the music was loud but not blaring, the clientele looked young and fun, the performing servers did a great job entertaining the crowd, etc.   The Service:  We were sitting there for about 10min and were never handed menus. Fine, it's busy, I understand. Although I saw our server walking around the restaurant, I didn't see him doing anything specific. I tried plenty of times to make eye contact/flag him down but he simply forgot we were there or something. But then a new table was seated right next to us and they were handed their menus, then their drinks, then their appetizer... all before we were even given menus. Eventually, our waiter came by and quickly dropped off menus and said he'd be right back. The problem was that he didn't come back for another 15min which meant we were there for 25min in total just waiting for someone to come by to take a beer order. My friend and I agreed that if our server didn't come by in the next few minutes then we were leaving. Sure enough, those minutes rolled around so we picked up our purses to head out and who walks on over but our server asking if we're ready with our drink orders (Seriously? drink orders? we've been ready with those for 20min). So I said to him \"Listen, we were just getting up to leave. I understand that it's busy for you guys but not a single person acknowledged us or even thought to take a drink order.\" Our server then said \"Oh, sorry guys, I'll take care of you.\" Since we were both starving, we gave him our small order and hoped it would come quickly.  We noticed how many tables were emptying so we were curious to check what time they closed. Found out the place closed at 10:00pm (right when we arrived) which made the whole experience worse. You'd think that if a place was closing then they'd do their best to get those tables taken care of so they can leave sooner. Instead, we were there until 11pm even though we only had a small dinner.  We looked over our check at the end to see that our server didn't \"take care of us\" like he implied earlier. I mean, I thought that meant at the very least a comped beer to lessen the blow that he forgot about us for 30min. Instead, I felt like he walked all over us.  The Food: Our entire dinner order was one edamame appetizer, two rolls each (so 4 total), and two large beers and it all came out to $100 before tip. The sushi itself was pretty mediocre and the garlic edamame was much spicier than we anticipated. The sad thing was that we were both hungry only a few hours after spending all that money on that tiny dinner. There are countless top quality places in Vegas and I see no point in returning to this restaurant.  tl;dr Although this place had an upbeat atmosphere, it was way overpriced and the risk of crappy service again seems too high. Not my type of sushi joint.",

Our server who greeted us (Jen?) didn't reappear until the end of our dining experience.  There seemed to be a lot going on with the staff... lots of whispering, in and out of the kitchen/back room.

My husband and I ordered the rok and roll (?), the el chapo roll with some sort of tomatillo sauce and a sashimi platter. The rok and roll is about 5 pieces of sushi on skewers that resemble lollipops. The fish was more like a cheap chopped up filling and had a texture similar to canned tuna. There was very little flavor. The el chapo roll was tiny and again had very little flavor. The sashimi was the best dish we ordered but still tasted a bit dry, almost as if it wasn't fresh. We love sushi and never have a problem finishing what we order (which is usually more than 2 rolls and a few pieces of sashimi), but we didn't even finish the food here. Our meal came out to $200 so it was definitely a huge disappointment (especially when we were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary). Also, kind of off topic but the restroom is very small and is shared with men's stalls on one side and women's on the other. It is strange and uncomfortable. Every person in there was complaining that they felt awkward and was not a fan of the space. Would not recommend.",

My husband and I ordered the tofu tempura, rock shrimp, wagu beef sliders, miso cod, O toro and hamachi sashimi, king crab California roll, and of course, the honey toast. Everything is a must! The fish is so fresh, the rock shrimp was just the right amount of spicy, the miso cod was melt in your mouth, and the honey toast was so tasty and convenient to eat (they cut it up in little croutons).   Now, that was only the food. On to the staff, they are your entertainment. They are not only efficient and friendly servers, but great dancers. I was so pumped up once I left Sake Rok!

Right away we were greeted like we were the only group there (we weren't, restaurant was full). The service was top notch! No one's drink was ever empty, waters were topped off every 30 seconds it seemed.  We ordered from the recommendation of the manager. We received a variety of tastiness. Let me tell you, everything was incredibly delicious. The cook yourself Wagyu beef was to die for. The Godzilla platter was whimsical and mouthwatering. I love sushi and this place blew away my expectations! Cocktails were stiff and fun. We ordered the shark bowl (I believe it was called) for our entire party, Great drink!   My group had heard that the entertainment here was great, but in my opinion, that is the understatement of the year! Our first round of cocktails were a group sake bombs! Which was beautifully facilitated by our phenomenal host Jonas. This guy really had such a great energy about him, and it really enhanced our experience. I loved every aspect of the entertainment, the singing and dancing was out of this world.   The music was right in the wheelhouse of my group. Lot's of songs from our youth that was easy to sing along to. At one point we were deciding what to do after dinner, nobody wanted to leave, so we hung by the bar. The DJ turned up the music, the staff cleared some of the tables, so we had a dance and singalong party. So much so, that we closed the place down.   The owner, manager, wait staff/dancers, DJ, and everyone for that matter were so hospitable. I cannot express this enough. I can speak for my group, in saying that we were truly taken care of.  Overall I give this place an A+++ I wish I could give this establishment 10 stars, but, I suppose 5 stars will suffice. I cannot recommend this place highly enough to EVERYONE who wants to have a blast in Vegas! I go to Vegas at least once a year and from here on out I will be frequenting this fine establishment.",

There were hardly any guests in the restaurant when we arrived around 2:30pm. Literally, we were one of two tables seated when we first arrived. The wait staff was extremely nice and attentive. The MC for the day was especially funny and simply exuded everything I imagined was Vegas. The dance numbers the staff performed were fun. We joined them in dancing and of course did a sake bomb with the MC! I ordered two rolls, and one was absolutely delicious while the other had a bad taste and it was clear the fish was not fresh. I eventually had to tell the waiter and return the food. The staff did everything to make it up to me, comping the bad roll and even serving us dessert on the house. I truly appreciate their efforts to make it up to me, but unfortunately I was sick with diarrhea for the next few days afterwards. I think it's the first time I've ever had food poisoning at a restaurant and despite the top notch service, it couldn't make up for the awful runs . :(",

They started off with a sake shot, of course, and then went into a whirlwind of dance, song, and some phenomenal foodsk! We gave Rich our price point per person, dietary restrictions, and he took care of all of the ordering! At one point, a Flinstones type meat bone thing came to the table, accompanied by Godzilla breathing fire. The spectacle here is off the charts folks. Every 10 mins they broke into song and dance from the 90s and included our party in all of the fun. This is by far, one of the coolest group dinners we've had! Food was spot on, entertainment was legit, and for sure, ask for RICH and MITCH to enhance your dinning experience! Can't wait to come back :) :) :)",

AND as we men know with women taking their time, I called to say we are running late and they reassured us not to worry.  When we checked in, there was a wait with guests, but we were escorted right in to our table. The hostess was pleasant and the wait staff very attentive. They provide complimentary edamame which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered three sushi rolls and a sashimi platter. The presentation and taste, not to mention the freshness of the sashimi was amazing!   The topping on the cake was the \"show\" that was put on as entertainment. Superb high energy with a great Pre party vibe! Hands down, I definitely would return back to Sake Rock! Plus is conveniently located across the Park Theatre and next to the T-Mobile theatre within the Monte Carlo Hotel area.",

The decor was kind of cool and the bathroom attendant was sweet. I would suggest going somewhere else for sushi though.",

Service was ridiculously slow, the restaurant hardly had anyone in it. We got the ayce. Which might have been a mistake. There is an hour limit. Our waiter took our order every 45 mins with a 3 item limit. Our plates were empty pretty much the whole time we were there, approximately 2 and a half hours! Don't think we will be going back next time. Our party of 8 were all late going back to our expo appointments. Not happy!",

He knew the exact line between engaging the audience and keeping people feeling comfortable. He was quick witted, an excellent dancer, and basically I would have paid him to hang out with me for the night. He deserves his own 5 star review.   As for the food, it was really tasty, small portions, Vegas stupid prices (but standard). My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed what we ordered - we can't remember the name of our favorite roll but think it was called \"diablo.\" We left full and had 3 rolls and an app.  For the drinks, we were very excited about the sake flights. This is a must! They're house sake is excellent.   Our service was also great! Our server even joined in the dance at one point and shredded up the corner of the restaurant. Also, special shout out to the second server helping us. He was from our home town of San Diego and very friendly and attentive. To the Managers reading this: every one I just mentioned deserves a bonus.",

They got each portion of the order wrong and we literally had to flag down the server each and every time. The MC was painful. The MC should be the most important position in the place and he was horrific. He wasn't funny, his singing was horrible and he rubbed multiple guests the wrong way. I would strongly suggest they re-cast. Regarding the dance numbers, the expressions on the faces of the staff was like from the movie \"Waiting\" with Ryan Reynolds. The staff looked like they hated every minute and like they had to come out and do another Birthday song. Additionally they added a 22% service charge to the bill. I understand you add a charge for large parties but I am going to look up and see if 22% is even legal. I have been to places all over the world and for the price they are charging for sushi one has high expectations and this was truly the most frustrated I have been in years at a restaurant. I hope the owners read their reviews otherwise their investment will be short lived. They are trying to be a jack of all trades here and they have mastered none.",

    "text": "We came here because it was near our hotel and had good reviews. The service was quite slow, especially considering there were only 2 other tables seated. When we first sat down we were given dinner menus and the our waitress brought the lunch menu, which had significantly less options, but we were still able to order off the dinner menu so we were unsure what the purpose of the lunch menu was. Our waitress Jacinthe was very sweet and conversational. They were very accommodating to our needs. The prices were somewhat high for the portion sizes ($17 for crispy rice, $15 for beef satay, etc.) - but some were worth the money (tempura green beans!) The sushi rolls were pretty small. The food was pretty spicy, so keep that in mind if you don't like spicy! Overall, it was good but I wouldn't recommend going here if you don't mind going into a hotel for a restaurant that is better but inside.",

We were greeted right away, the staff was very friendly and nice.   We ordered the Shishito Peppers - crispy garlic, lime, sea salt one of the most ordered items. Very taste and light every third or fourth one would be spicy to me but very delicious.   Then we just ordered two rolls because we did not want a lot so we shared the Kamikaze Roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, tuna, jalapeno vinaigrette, eel, sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro - this roll was amazing I thought it would be spicy but it was  not excellent combination great flavor.   The other Volcano Roll - eel, cream cheese, avocado, spicy kani & scallop, baked with spicy dynamite sauce - I thought his would have also been spicy was not, it was so delicious great mixture.   Would definitely love to try more rolls out next time where in town.",

One night we decided to stop in for a drink after a Vegas Golden Knights win and use those drink coupons. The bouncer was more interested in talking to his friends than checking IDs and kept the 5 or 6 people interested in having a drink waiting until his conversation was done.   Apparently there is no smoking in the bar (really ????) and no table service if you are outside.   After every Knights win, I light up a cigar in celebration yet I was told to put out my cigar AND leave their bar.  No this isn't a $2 cigar & I'm not going to douse it in a glass of water. No problem - I left and spent my money at one of the other bars nearby and I'll never go back, not even with BOGO drinks.",

Not filling at all. Was a little disappointed on how much I paid for such little food, BUT WHEN IN VEGAS!  2.  The service was GREAT! When I came in we only waited about 5 mins.  4. There is a short show/dancing. It is fun and entertaining for a little bit. Please be advised that it gets noisy so if you're picky or on a date you mY want to go elsewhere. Its6meant to ha e ALL GOOD TIMES! It's the strip!!  5. The place is very nicely decorated. The interior has beautiful wall painting and a great atmosphere.   6. The food is okay (hit or miss). I had also purchased the agadashi tofu, that was actually tasty.  Overall, if you are visiting Vegas and want a fun place to eat and are willing to pay the price, I would recommend this place. The food isn't the best but it is different from the usual restaurant experience.",

I started with a Sake Sangria that had a nice flavor and wasn't too sweet. The drink packed some punch and left me happy. For starters we shared Crispy Rice and Edamame (add garlic butter). The Crispy Rice was delicious and had the heat I craved. This was unexpectedly small compared to portions most restaurants serve for this starter. The Edamame was great and had a little kick to it.   Our main rolls were the El Chapo roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. Both were delicious, but small portions so I'd definitely order more next time. We wrapped up with Honey Toast which was very good. The server cut this open for us which made it easy to eat.   The atmosphere is very lively and closer to a party than a restaurant. It made for a fun dining experience. The staff worked together wonderfully to make sure we had everything we needed. It was excellent service.",

I dined for lunch and was surprised to find that they have an all you can eat option, which includes starters, regular AND signature rolls for $35--SCORE!! The best part about it was the quality of their sushi. They serve extremely fresh, flavorful and very presentable sushi, which is a big win in my book. I ordered the Tiger Roll, Girl on the Beach, and the Spicy Samurai. None of them disappointed! In fact, I alone, ate all but four pieces. I also received wonderful service, which added to my experience. The servers were super nice, friendly, and kept my glass full at all times. I definitely plan to return any and every time I come to Vegas!",

    "text": "I have visited here previously about a month ago. I had a great time with a friend enjoyed a bottle of wine and a few sushi rolls and the edamame. I am not a sushi newbie and frequent excellent restaurants in la where I live. This time today was the worst experience I have had in a long time. Not to mention the fact the both times I've been here it's been extremely slow so you think service would be better when there is a bunch of people standing around. The only one who had manners was the man who greeted us so nicely and consistently gave us water throughout our meal. The little girl who was \"waitressing\" our table was lacking so many skills.  The downfall for me was when I tried the $40 sashimi plate. I was gagging on the texture of the fish because I don't believe it was cut properly. The presentation was beautiful but lacked taste and everything I put in my mouth was chewy. When I finally got the waitress over to let her know after summoning other colleagues of hers because she was no where to be found she said we ate the majority of the fish which is a lie. Out of 12 pieces we ate a total of 4. So after her telling us she didn't need our tip and started arguing with me about charging us for the fish we never ate I went and spoke with one of the chefs. In the end they took off the fish but it's sad that this wasn't taken care of previously and she tried to interagency as I was speaking with the manager. On so many levels of hospitality this was wrong. Event though the said they would make it up to me next time I will not be back.",

Our server Tara was so nice, fun and really attentive! She is a definite asset to their staff! :)  Not only is this place entertaining, the food is absolutely delicious! My favorite dishes are the Pan Seared Scallops & the baked crab hand rolls made with baked snow crab and this spicy aioli sauce, they are made to perfection! I will definitely be back!",

She was very sweet and navigated us through the entire menu. She also started off by asking us if we have any allergies and I thought that was refreshing because my friend has a slight shellfish allergy that I didn't know about. We started off with the garlic and chili edamame, best one I've had so far btw! Our server Jenny recommended some sushi rolls and I had the el chapo roll and my friend had the spicy samurai roll. We had a lovely dining experience here and we can't wait to come back!",

If it wasn't for the lasting impression that the employees, atmosphere, food, and well... everything, has left on me, I probably wouldn't bother writing a review.   My friend had his bachelor's party in Las Vegas over the weekend and we stumbled upon a little hidden gem of a sushi restaurant right next to a huge glowing statue of a dancing woman. Entering the restaurant, I immediately felt the vibe and energy of the venue. People were cheering, laughing and having a great time. Then the performers came on. They did all sorts of covers of 90s hits from backstreet boys and N sync. It was amazing and nostalgic, magnificent.   The food was delicious served by a pair of the friendliest servers I've met all weekend. James and Jen were exceptionally receptive and helpful, not to mention really funny, haha! They taught us how to take sake Bombs, the Sake Rok way. \"When I say Sake Rok, you say Sake Bomb!\" Then we proceeded to pound the table until the shot of sake fell off of the chopsticks and into our beer. Awesome! The event hyped the night to come.  Would I come again? absolutely. Ill bring an army of hungry fun loving friends as well.  Thanks to all the great talent and service guys!!!!",

I took my mother out for dinner and we had no idea what a great time we were in for.  Cesar put on a show for the entire room as well as the servers who clearly put time and effort into learning their routines to keep the atmosphere lively!  Tara and Nick took such good care of us, gave great recommendations, were extremely attentive, and made sure that our experience was nothing short of splendid.  If you like sushi and fun, THIS is the place to go.  Live DJ keeping the vibes very upbeat, performances by the staff every half hour or so, and the chefs have clearly mastered their trade.  Highly recommend the El Chapo roll for an out of this world taste like I've never had elsewhere.  The combination of jalapeno puree and the slice of lemon will make your tastebuds jump for joy! This was the total package that you wouldn't expect from a sushi bar, but something taken right off the strip in Vegas in terms of satisfaction and entertainment!  Thank you to Tara, Nick, and Cesar for showing us a wonderful time and we look forward to coming back again!!!",

We went there with a large group and had the server do a shared fixed menu, which was awesome because everyone got to try a little of everything.  Sake Rok is located in the Park in front of T-Mobile Arena, between the Monte Carlo and NYNY casinos. Parking is easy at Monte Carlo main valet or NYNY self parking for direct access.  The stand-alone outside location is much better than trudging through one of the bustling casinos.  My favorite dishes are the Rock Shrimp Tempura and the El Chapo roll.  Head chef came from Sushi Samba and it shows.  Highly recommend, 5 stars all the way.",

I have to have to give it to the Geisha Female ( MC) singer, I believe her name is Lily.... she made her rounds and joined every group, but to top it off..... this girl can SING ( better than anyone on the Strip)!!!!

They play great, loud music. The waitstaff is attentive and creative. They all dance and lip sync and the emcee of the evening is always a riot. He does sake bombs with guests and pokes fun at them a bit-- or flatters them. The music is all sing-along and the DJ pumps some good jams. It's an over-the-top great Vegas spot to take guests. They have yummy cocktails and the apps/meals are good- so if you have a non-sushi lover, there's plenty to chose from. It's a bit pricey- but it's the strip. Go for the fun.",

I tried the sliders, chicken, and sushi and nothing made me want more. Honestly I only ate the food because I paid for it. How about this I would never go there again even if I had a 50% off coupon.   Tip - After you walk in a see the over the top prices on the largest menu in the world, it is ok to just walk out and go somewhere else. Or and another tip, just ignore the crazy guy massaging the other guy at the bar. I guess one of the employees was sore and another guy was rubbing ice on him. This isn't a joke. I should have taken a picture of this.",

    "text": "We made reservations on Open Table after reading the reviews on Yelp.  This is a new trendy sushi spot in New York New York area.  It was our 20th wedding anniversary dinner before our show.  Upon calling Sake Rok, I specifically  inquired about the All You Can Eat menu.  We wanted to do that as the rolls that they had were really expensive and not worth it.  However if you do the AYCE menu it would be worth it.  She insisted that it was the best way to go and confirmed our dinner reservations. We arrived and were seated back by the elevator.  At the 6:45 time we arrived, the place was DEAD - like really no one was there and the girls waiting to seat us were so busy with their own conversation and playing with their hair and phones that we felt ignored.  The DJ (??) at the bar was pretty loud and obnoxious dressed in drag.  Once seated it took literally 7 minutes to be greeted by our server.  In the 7 minutes we waited, we were confused as the menu didn't have the AYCE option.  We were disappointed in the sushi roll selection.  It was pretty limited compared to most places and the ones they did offer were outrageously expensive.  Seriously, who pays $17 for a basic California roll?  As we sat there waiting, we decided that this was not the place for us.  FINALLY our server arrived and asked if we wanted water?  Really, we sat here for 7 minutes with no service and you are asking if we want water?  A drink in Vegas would have been appreciated.  Then what sealed the deal, I asked about the AYCE menu as it wasn't to be found.  She said, \"oh that's only at lunch.\"  WHAT???  I specifically spoke with the hostess 3 days ago asking about the menu, details and reservations -she never told me it was lunch only.  THAT'S IT -we left, walked out, didn't eat and then had to find a place to grab dinner before our show.  Such a disappointment.  I should have listened to the Waldorf when they suggested Yellowtail at the Bellagio over this place!  Don't waste your money or time!",

We were quickly seated in the corner of the restaurant with a great view of the dancers and the rest of the customers. I was relieved to be placed away from the dancing employees. They tried to get as many people to dance with them and were super extroverted.  The noise level of this place was similar to going to a night club. If you needed to talk to someone, you pretty much had to speak up really loudly or else the loud noise would drown out your voice.   The menu was a little hard to read. The disco lights kept changing colors. The area we were sitting at would go dark and then become bright after 5 seconds. I had to wait for the room to get bright before making my food selection.   I finally selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($10) and Tempura Roll ($15). Each roll contained 8 pieces.   The Salmon Avocado Roll had tons of salmon. Some of the salmon pieces I received were 0.5\" x 0.5\" x 0.5\". This place was also not cheap on the avocado pieces. I could actually taste avocado unlike the other sushi restaurants I have been to. The Tempura Roll was great as well! The rice tasted as if it was deep fried. I did not see tempura flakes. It tasted very warm and fresh. The spicy mayo was a little spicier than what I remember.   This place was a little expensive, but the food was great!",

Sake Rok is fun. It's vibrant. It's lively. It's delicious. It's just overall a great place to be. If I wanted to recommend a place to be for an occasion, Sake Rok would be perfect.   The staff break out in song and dance every now and then. There's an MC (shoutout to Jonnis--I love you and you're amazing) who interacts with the guests and really makes the place alive. If you're lucky, you may even get pulled up to dance :)  Food - 5/5 I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the food here. There's definitely a unique touch to it, such as the edamame and the peppers you're given in the beginning. The sashimi tastes fresh and melts in my mouth. The sushi rolls were all amazing! I had one dish that involved mushrooms & steak and it was ah-may-zingggg. Overall, all loved the food!  Drinks - 5/5 Okay the cocktails are typical strip price so don't be scared. It tastes amazing. The staff really gave me great recommendations, drink after drink!  Staff - 5/5 I really can't complain. Everyone was helpful and friendly while also being energetic and fun :)  I highly recommend giving Sake Rok a visit! The food, the drinks, the staff, it's all amazing! Great energy, great time. :)",

She even asked the sushi chef about a couple rolls just to make sure they were indeed gluten free. I ordered the tiger roll, spicy tuna roll, and salmon nigiri. All were very good.

As you can see from the photo, the tuna and salmon?   Quality of the sushi was average.  I went on a Sunday night and they were not busy. They had a 90s night music and MC.   If you're looking for something unique or exceptional sushi, this is not the place.",

This made it so we didn't get our food for an hour, while tables coming in a lot later were eating and leaving. Our server was not attentive and didn't even try to fix the situation early on, we were just left there waiting and waiting. We talked to two different servers and a manager because I server was simply not around or avoiding our table because of the situation. Look I've worked in the restaurant industry and you don't runaway from a mistake you go up head on and handle it right away. Very disappointed about this experience because we had heard this was a good place. We ending up leaving after only receiving 2/5 rolls after an hour for a table of five people, we honestly shouldn't have had to pay for anything but our drinks at this point. Never coming back.",

The fish came to us like rubber, I waved for the waitress a guy came to us and told us she had left & forgotten about the rest of our order. We sat for 45 min with nothing but tea. Then the poor waiter comes to tell us the chef said we just need to pay for the tea. Lmao so I paid 8.44 to chill hungry as heck & no apology for the waitress bouncing on us or for the rubbery fish he said was half frozen. Wow half frozen!!!! This local ain't ever going back!!!!",

Genasis was performing and that's what we were here for.  Was a good idea to arrive without expectations or I would not have been surprised.  This restaurant gave many WOW factors as to the look, the feel, the performers who were also our servers, the food presentation, the sushi and sashimi FLAVORS, the prices hahahaaa, and DJ for the event.  But it was New Year's; why not spoil myself and Ness.    Being a holiday occasion, we got their special 5 course menu.  After salad, appetizers, edamame munchies, sushi, sashimi, and the ever so delish main course with Cod - we were feeling it... FULL.  The cod was very nice.  Had a sweetness and a crunch to the top layer.  There was also a mushroom dish with rice that totally tasted like adobo.  Their edamame SO GOOD had seasoning and lime.  We loved their sushi and sashimi, especially the one on a radish slice!  They offered a $50 unlimited well drinks special during the dinner hours.  Wristbands were given.  And this cost made sense, as from the outside bar, one drink is $20.  Bring on the vodka!    The bonus in dining here is there are daily performances by the servers.  This was the biggest plus besides the amazing food and wall art.  Note that the bill reflects a minimum 20% gratuity.  I'm guessing it's because of the show included in the dining experience - understandable.  While we were here, large group tables did Sake Bombs with the main host performer.  Hilarious guy, very entertaining.  Props out to our server Amanda too!  You go ladybug!  And to the other ladies and gents who filled in clearing out empty dishes and offering the next round of drinks.  Yay points!  The interior of this place is pretty awesome!  Props to the artist(s).  The main dining room was transformed into a dance floor.  Second floor was set up for bottle service sections.  And I learned there's a 3rd floor rooftop.  Definitely designed for fun happenings.  Here's to looking at a bright 2017 with tremendous possibilities ahead!!!",

    "text": "I decided to try sake rok because I knew one of the sushi chefs there plus I was looking for a good spot to have some good sushi and celebrate my friend's bachelorette party. I couldn't be happier about the whole experience. It is right on the strip by the t-mobile arena. We arrived a little early but were greeted by a promoter that offered us one complimentary drink upstairs of sake rok which I assume is their bar area. After we had our drink we returned downstairs for our dinner reservation. We got seated immediately. The atmosphere was fun and lights were dimmed almost club like which we enjoyed because we were there to have fun. We ordered one of their punch bowls called pink pagoda. We knew we had to try it because it looked like it was the drink to get. It's perfect for sharing if you have a group of 2 or more! We order some spicy garlic edamame for our appetizer and picked 4 different rolls to share between us 4 girls! The food was great and plenty enough for us. Last but not least my favorite part was the entertainment. During dinner the servers and bartender started breaking out in dance! It was so much fun to watch and at times I couldn't sit still and wanted to get up and dance! I left wanting to work there! Lol I would highly recommend this place if you not only want good food but entertainment with dinner as well! :D",

I've never been to sushi place Witt entertainment before so wasn't sure what to expect but i am glad we got to go. Entertainment guy in red coat was exceptional and he made sure all guests are included & felt welcomed. It was super nice.",

    "text": "I have never experienced dining like this before. I didn't look at reviews beforehand, just came here on a friends suggestion. If you're looking for a nice intimate spot to share sushi with a date or friends, this is not the place for you. It's a loud, half bar, half club, half restaurant, half instructional video establishment.  One of the weirder elements involved in dining here is a dude, who I want to refer to as the hype man. He was all done up with make-up and funky attire. He stopped by our table twice to make small talk with us. We just weren't into it. He was nice enough, but I could have done without him.   I've also never been to a restaurant with instructional videos. I've been to lots of bars with TV's playing games (which this one was when it wasn't showing said videos). The table next to us ordered saki bombs. Then the hype man came over to hype up the fact that they were ordering the bombs and told us to turn our attention to the screen. It legit was a silly sketch on how to do a saki bombs. Thanks?  The sushi was good, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed almost everything we ordered, except for the eel roll with foam on top. It was one of the specialty ones, and I just didn't care for the taste or texture. We ordered yellowtail jalapeno, spicy salmon and a handful of other rolls. The yellowtail was my fave, no surprise there as it's always my fave. I was surprised at the contrast between the SUPER attentive hype man and our lackadaisical server. We had to wave her down for the check, because we never saw her after our sushi was delivered. We would have ordered another round if she would have stopped by.   I think I get what they're trying to do. Out of the box dining experience with club atmosphere flair. I just don't know how into it I was. Maybe it would have been better to stop by for drinks? I'm just not sure I'm sold on the schtick.",

We put in a small order with him in the beginning wanting to order more later but wound up having to order through the busser. He got the order wrong and we wound up with a different roll than we wanted but it just seemed pointless to try and get it fixed since our server was still dancing or MIA. Also, it's really loud so be bring your outside voice if you want to have a conversation.  -Yellowtail - Good..oh so tiny tho -Rok and Roll - What we got instead of what we wanted. Just chopped up fish on a slice of cucumber. 0 flavor. -Miso Black Cod - Delicious (per my friend) it's his favorite thing to get and I agree. -Beef Tataki - Good, like others I've had -Pork Dumplings - Amazing -Tuna Taco - Chopped up tuna in a taro \"taco\" chip. It wasn't seasoned at all. Wanted wasabi and ginger but the server was gettin down with N'Snyc and Backstreet Boys so we just ate it.  It's an interesting concept and I really enjoyed the energy especially of our own server when I saw him out there but it seems like they focus more on choreography than the food service  I think it's worth a trip at least once to experience but I'm not going to pay for parking to go there again.",

    "text": "This place just opened so we stopped by to have lunch for my birthday today. We walk in and apparently they close after lunch and reopen for dinner at a certain time, which is not posted anywhere on their menu or on this app. They only offer parts of the menu during this inbetween lunch and dinner period. My gf and I decided to sit down and try it anyway even though we wouldn't be able to order from the full menu. We were hungry and in the mood for sushi.   Garlic edamame - oily and bland; didn't think edamame was a hard dish to execute, but I guess it can be for some $7   1 piece of tako nigiri - 1 piece for $5. Nothing special. Tasted like typical tako nigiri. Again.. 1 frickn piece.   Salt and pepper shrimp - this dish was tasty; shrimp was cooked nicely and had a nice crisp to it - $14  Tuna tataki - delicious; most places never go wrong with this dish; made with ponzu sauce $15  Westside Roll - this roll had different ingredients, but was tasty as well; surprising ingredients included Asian pear and a peanut curry sauce $18 for 6 pieces.... Seriously 6 pieces   The food overall was for the most part tasty, but honestly the prices are not worth the portions. I realize this restaurant is on the strip, but really for a more reasonable price you can get tasty sushi many other places in Vegas. The ambiance was unique and the restaurant has a cool vibe.   Also, being that we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time, service was pretty slow. I also realize this restaurant just opened and perhaps the are still getting things situated and organized, but management who have their shit together usually translate into staff having their shit together.   Being from Hawaii I've eaten a lot of sushi and although most of the dishes were tasty, the prices were a bit steep in my opinion. Again, quality sushi can be found for much more reasonable prices in many other locations in Vegas... Like Sakana for example. I guess that's the price you pay for eating on the strip.",

But this one time that I think about trying it cause I am going to an event and I am sure it should be one of your sudoeste nights. Show up to podium and the ladies ask for a reservation which I don't have. I ask for a table for two. They say they are extremely busy and would have to wait 15/20 mins for a table. So I say perfect. I guess the sushi bar works since you're so good and busy. As soon as I am being taken to bar and see the inside of the restaurant and realize there's not even 50% of the restaurant seated. I see couples on tables for 4ppl and then wonder how come you want to make me wait when your restaurant is so dead. Staff? I hope you were expecting to have more than 50% today with a sold out arena.  Anyway, good way to make sure a local who eats out all day every day never comes back to your restaurant.",

Unfortunately, this time our overall experience failed our expectations. Most of the food was heavily salted and they actually forgot one of our sushi rolls after they said it was \"on its way.\" Really? The music was pathetic by playing N'Sync and Backstreet Boys songs for a place called \"Sake Rok.\" However, I did enjoy the dancers and overall entertainment because they tried hard to entertain us, so kudos to them! But, by far the worst part was the service because our server disappeared more often than he appeared. We had to flag him down many times just to get service if we could find him!!! So, based on this experience and with so many other Japanese-themed Strip restaurants to choose from, we will never be coming back.",

So we dined here Tuesday night for an early dinner since it was conveniently located near our hotel . EVERYTHING we ordered was AMAZING! Our server ( which I wish I remembered her name) gave us EXCELLENT recommendations, along with the other staff who was very helpful with refilling our drinks, and clearing plates! We ordered  -shishito peppers (usually not spicy but this bach was however, they were still flavorful and delicious) -maguro nigiri  -half doz oysters (west coast) -s&p shrimp which was AMAZING!  -crispy rice w/ spicy tuna which was also amazing !!! -el chap roll & westside roll very refreshing! -Asking for trouble cocktail BOMB!!!  small plates and rolls are reasonably priced!  My boyfriend and I are big sushi eaters and this place by far is up there on our new top favorite! We definitely will be back!",

The girl on the beach was very good, though I would probably try another one next time. The seaweed salad was good too. It can be a little bit loud inside, but if you're looking for entertainment you found the right place! The staff had a whole choreographed routine to Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC songs so that was kind of fun. If you're looking for a quiet place to go out, this is not the place for you, but if you're looking for dinner and a show this is the place for you! Thank you for a delicious dinner Sake Rok, Amanda and the rest of the staff (:",

The Tiger Roll that I got was also tasty and filled me up. Edamame was nice (it's kind of hard to mess edamame up).

Like with any new restaurant, they have some grand opening kinks to work out, and that's too be expected.  I wandered in here on my lunch break and the LOUD music blasting towards outside should've been my first clue as to how this was going to be.....but we went in anyways.  The downstairs dining room is fairly intimate. The tables are very close together....but don't worry about anyone else being able to hear your conversation - nobody can hear ANYTHING because the music is so freaking loud. I know I sound super old right now, but this is just not my scene. This is the perfect place to go with a group if you are celebrating something fun or heading out for the night.   The wait staff all seem like they just drank a case of Red Bull each.....they were all over the place. Turns out they are all actually dancers/entertainers and don't have a lot of food service experience. They were all very nice though, if not a little scattered. They actually all do choreographed routines and dance around the restaurant. It's cool, but who's serving my food while this is happening? Kinda weird.  If you'd like to know about the vibe - there is a DJ with a dance floor, as well as a roof top deck. The menus are HUGE - something you'll have to see to believe.   Now, the food - it was actually really good. I just had the wagyu sliders (which have foie gras on them - YES!) and the hamachi serrano, which is always a favorite of mine. Both were VERY good.  Overall, I think this place is a great addition to the Park and will do very well since they are right by the new arena.",

    "text": "This place isn't for me, but it's a great spot on the strip for anyone visiting the T-Mobile Arena to come and have a great time before (or after) a show.   They are a bit gimmicky for my taste.  We went before the Garth Brooks concert and the waitstaff was all dressed in \"country\" attire and the specials were all huge steaks. I suppose they were catering to the T-Mobile Arena audience, but the character of the place got lost a bit in all of that for me. What I didn't realize until later, was that the party/fun element is part of what they do.   I loved the entrance with the huge sake barrels--the whole place has a minimalist, urban, industrial thing going on. Who doesn't these days? But after you are seated they bring you these huge menus that are a great conversation piece. But a hassle for reading and selecting.   The group ordered a ton of food, but I only tasted the roasted cauliflower, the miso soup, and the sashimi.  This is NOT the type of place to come expecting  high quality fish--I don't care what the waitress says.  I knew it when we picked this place and I'm glad my expectations were low. There is better quality fish to be had in most other sushi places in this valley. But those in our party with cooked dishes seemed to really enjoy them.   There was this simmering party atmosphere because at a designated time, the waiters were all prepared break into song and dance. People were dancing around a bit in anticipation of their performances and a lively emcee was serving sake bombs to various tables.   Sake bombs are definitely a thing here. You will be made aware of each one that is consumed.  We left before the festivities began, but I can see people either loving or hating that element of the vibe. If you're not into it, arrive early. The \"show\" starts at 7:00.   In all, tourists will like it.   I actually appreciate what they are doing at Sake Rok--I'm all about an entertaining meal and a bit of spectacle. This is Vegas, right? But, for me, the food just didn't offer enough to bring me back.",

At least 3 members of the waitstaff were too hungover to give a shit and the bartender couldn't figure out how to pour a Sapporo, an IPA, or ANYTHING (but, sweet! I saved a Hamilton). I was charged for the beers and had to have the bill corrected.  The rolls & soup were just fine. It had the 2x price increase that you get on the Las Vegas strip.  Recommendation: Cancel lunch OR offer lunch specials at a reasonable price with a waitstaff that knows how to work at the early hour of 12:30.",

From the amazing art all around the restaurant, the fresh cuts of assorted sashimis' to this 42oz tomahawk steak we shared, Sake Rok is my favorite place to go in Las Vegas! They have a live DJ and a emcee that keeps the energy going throughout the entire evening, as well as all these crazy sake bomb races between tables. While we were enjoying our meal the entire staff broke out in this dance off battle between Backstreet boys vs Nysc that have the entire restaurant involved.   The experience overall at Sake Rok is amazing! Located right next to the T-Mobile Arena at The Park this place is perfect to go to before and after a concert, NHL game or even just a random week night out.",

I found the oversized menus to be very gimmicky and ridiculous to use. We settled on a combination of rolls and a veggie tempura appetizer.  The tempura was delicious with a crunchy mix of veggies fried to perfetion. The yellowtail jalapeno roll was disappointing, but the El Chapo roll with spicy crab, shrimp and tomatillo was good.  Probably the best roll out of the bunch was the Tiger.  This place might be better to visit at night after a few drinks and a more lively crowd.",

There was what looked like an office gathering near us, sure they stared but didn't bother us. We sat down and ordered our food.  We were starting to wonder when our food didn't arrive after 30 mins. It wasn't busy and most tables were already eating - we were the only new party that was seated. We asked numerous people what the deal was and we got no definitive answer. We kept looking at the sushi \"chefs\" and they just looked at us with blank stares. Weren't they wondering why we were just sitting there with no food? They kept staring at us and not doing anything about it. Even the entertainer was wondering where our food was.  When some of our food arrived, we were thinking our food was finally coming. Nope. We continued to wait for another 30 minutes. No other tables were being sat and at this point, the sushi area was starting to close down. Shortly thereafter, the manager came over and said the waiter \"forgot\" to put our order in. So you mean to tell us that he put in part of our order (which was also incorrect) and then he forgot to put in the rest? We all felt super annoyed and upset. We got up and left.  If you're a trans person, crossdresser or anything similar, do not go here. They are NOT T FRIENDLY. They will smile in your face and treat you with no respect. If you're not a trans person, DO NOT come here. There are far better places than this in Vegas. We all felt discriminated against tonight and its a horrible feeling.  You would think in this day and age (and especially this town) restaurants would be cool with a group of crossdressers coming in for a meal. Instead our worst fears came to light.  This was really unfortunate.",

Another five minutes before I get the hot tea that I ordered. After the third hillbilly horse 5#!t song, I ask whoever is near me if they are going to play this garage all night. They advised it is up to the DJ. After the fourth round of the worst noise I have ever heard in a restaurant, I stand up and convey my disbelief that the staff are made to listen to nonsense at such obnoxious levels to the chef on the other side of the counter. As I am standing I ask the same chef where I can get change since no one has been around to take my order in the first place. I suffered through 3.5 rounds of the DJs finest and was ready to leave. I dropped a $20 and walked out not having touched a thing. I paid to leave this review.",

The elections included bland greens, salmon, steak, and chicken. All reminded me of a typical already prepared meal from a food store. The appetizers in the beginning were solid with veggie spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, and some sushi. I'm guessing these items were off the main menu as they were much better while the buffet dinner was not. The bartenders were good and always attentive to refills which was nice and he sake on draft was very good considering. The venue itself is nice with a large balcony complete with heat lamps and tables. The venue itself is very nice, but the meal was a let down. Maybe our event orders the wrong dishes, but overall I was not very impressed.",

The first person's order came out in about 20 minutes.  10 minutes later the second person's order came out.  About 10 minutes I flagged the waiter down and asked if that was their pattern....one meal every 10 minutes.  He gave me a dirty look and said he would 'ask the chef'.  The other two orders came out about 12 minutes later.  A second drink was ordered and brought out about 25 minutes later after all meals were finished.  No apology was offered.  He just set the drink down and walked away.  Service was the worst I have seen anywhere in a long long time.  The food is good but portions are small.  The prices are very high for what you get.  A small bottle of flavored Saki was $30....same drink at 'I Love Sushi' is $15.  A young girl (supervisor) was going table to table and would do a thumbs up gesture.  Not sure what that was about as she never asked anything or said anything.  It was certainly not a thumbs up experience.  We were given the wrong bill but could not get the server (or anyone) back over so after 10 minutes we left money and left.  Plenty of other places to choose before a hockey game (or anytime)",

Go for the food before an event and you will not be too full to fall asleep-lol. Thumbs down for the gender neutral bathrooms. The bathrooms took a whole star away from this review. They need an attendant to control the follow of traffic and it's just weird conversing with a male bathroom attendant who is looking at you like-women talk in the bathroom??? Yes we do. You have to high tail outta there fast Incase your the weird one hanging in the girls bathroom I mean bathroom#fail.  Ambience is great until you need a makeup touch up. I would still recommend this place as a trial run wouldn't hurt-right? plus who knows-this is the future right?(shudders)",

Was a little disappointed on how much I paid for such little food but I guess this is Vegas.  2. The portions are not large. As mentioned in #2, the volcano roll is 5 regular sized pieces.   3. The service was mixed. When I came in with a reservation and the place was probably only 20% filled, I still was asked to wait. According to the host, there was only one server in the area and was waiting for them to finish up their orders. But the waiter/waitress were kind and helpful.   4. There is a short show/dancing. It is fun and entertaining for a little bit. Then after a while it becomes noise that disturbs your conversations with whomever you came to the restaurant with.   5. The place is very nicely decorated. The interior has beautiful wall painting and a great atmosphere.   6. The food is okay (hit or miss). The volcano roll was a bit too heavy (like mayo heavy) for me but tasted pretty good. The first picture of the volcano roll by Sophia P. is not what it actually looks like. That picture shows more than 5 pieces. In reality it is only 5 pieces. The tempera shrimp was really bad... please don't get this....  Overall, if you are visiting Vegas and want a fun place to eat and are willing to pay the price, I would recommend this place. The food isn't the best but it is different from the usual restaurant experience.",

Prices a bit high but that's the strip. I ordered the 49th state roll and the salmon/avocado hand roll, my friend went with Baked crab hand rolls and Yellowtail jalapeno. A large order of edamame as well. Good stuff.  They have singing and some dancing in here as well, and a lot of sake bombs were going off. At one point the game was on and the entertainer was trying to sing Happy birthday to someone and no one was paying any attention...so it got redone during a commercial break. LOL.  Fun place. Food is decent, priced high, but a great atmosphere. And lots of cute waitresses!!! 4 stars for the atmosphere, 3.5 for the sushi.",

It was dinner and a show as well. The staff performed a few songs and were interactive with the tables, which was a really great experience.   The fish tasted very fresh, sushi rolls were perfectly portioned and had the right amount of sweet and spice.   The Rok Shrimp Tempura was rolled in a slight spice that was present but not over powering, which was my favorite dish of the night.   The Rok Chicken was very tender and had a really nice moisture to it. Tasted of great quality and was a fantastic visit.  If you have Amy or Serenity as your server, you're going to have a great time. Both of these ladies did a wonderful job.",

I enjoyed the ambiance a lot as they play good music and they have dancing entertainment. We were pretty tired after a day at the pool, so we opted not to do any sake bombs but if you do the host comes by and take the shot with you. Which I'm sure his is water. It was fun to watch. We got the pink pagoda drink which is huge. We shared it between two people but you can likely have 4 people drinking it. It was surprisingly tasty.  It was a little disappointing that the waitress didn't wish me a happy birthday at all, or acknowledge it in any way at dinner even though the hostess had asked me who's birthday it was and knew it was my birthday. Not sure I'd come back to celebrate anything but maybe a group dinner would be fun.",

After taking our drink order our server let us know he had to cut it short because he had to go dance. \"Literally\", he said.  Next think you know the lights and music start going and an MC dressed like a king/queen starts narrating a dance between our server and some girl. Then some other staff came out from around the corner dressed like Men in Black and danced to that Will Smith song. All in all, it was entertaining with plenty of crowd interaction...but it was also a little awkward because there were only about 8 tables seated in this HUGE place. It is a neat interior though.  My BF and I ordered a beer and sake. We weren't that hungry so we ordered two sushi rolls- Girl on the Beach and the Spicy Samurai. They were average. I live in a city where you can find some FANTASTIC sushi for the same or better prices, so I guess I'm a bit snooty in that regard. But still...a beer, sake and two sushi rolls (with edamame that was offered to us in a way that sounded like it was free) came out to over $100 including the tip. For average, not stoked. If the quality of the sushi were better, maybe I'd balk less.  Just remember, you're in Vegas so you're going to pay outrageous Vegas prices.",

Ambiance: There's a liveliness to Sake Rok created by their staff that's super fun and unique! When I went there was a host/MC chatting it up with tables and the team of servers would break out into song every so often to keep things fresh! Come for the upbeat ambiance, not if you're looking for a quiet dinner out haha!  Food: I was blown away by their Vegan menu, being that I'm a Flexatarian, which had BOMB mushrooms, avocado rolls, and veggies to choose from!   Drinks: Sushi & Veganism aside, there's so much to choose from with sushi to entrees! We even tried their red sake sangria and OH MY! Their wine and beer selection was pretty on point and not terrible for a location on the strip.  I'd love to come back for a VGK watch party or whenever it's not crazy on this side of the strip!",

Sake Rok popped up and boasted of live entertainment from their wait staff between table aisles, but only for dinner. AYCE sushi option before 4pm! Not bad for $25-35: basic to speciality sushi options with sushi rolls, limited nigiri, starters, and mochi. I heard it's probably the best AYCE deal on the whole Strip. Be prepared to pay extra for leftovers, including rice. Order only 3 items at a time. Late lunch was a quiet affair, save for the fun group celebrating with multiple rounds of sake bombs. I almost tried a Bunny bomb! Bacardi dragonberry rum & sparkling white peach sake, one of these days ...   Benjamin was our fun waiter and engaged in friendly convo with my friend (bday girl) and me. He said he had half a mind to bring us those sake bombs. We pretty much had a snack since dinner with the family was an hour later haha. Friend got ramen and I ordered the Peter Parker roll (fried soft shell crab) plus garlic edamame. Those beans were sour, lots of lime and not enough garlic. Made me miss spicy garlic edamame real bad from Aniki's back home. I tried the ramen and it's decent. PP roll was snack worthy and tasty. I'd definitely have to order another for a full lunch. Round crispies on the outside gave a satisfying crunch.   Interior looks cool and loft-like with two levels, and I heard a private function room on a third floor? I'd say ask for a second floor table along the glass wall to overlook downstairs for optimum entertainment viewing. Make a reservation for peak hours. To get here, walk past Shake Shack and Bruxie's, toward the T-Mobile arena. There's also an outside bar with comfy seats and heating lamps.",

Apparently it was the Sharks vs. Knights hockey game and a bunch of fans were getting quick bites in that area. This place was blasting music and all you keep hearing is the MC/Host shouting \"Sake Rok, Sake Bomb!\"   We got seated at the bar and we ordered a couple stuff. They didn't have a huge selection of sashimi choices and all the rolls were cooked. Coming here from the bay area, I felt that they're selection and the quality doesn't compare. We ordered the chef's omakase, couple of nigiris, shishito peppers, and the truffle buttered corn. I also got the Dragonfly drink which was to my surprise, pretty good.   The omakase and nigiris came out first. The fish tasted ok but not fresh. I felt that the rice in the nigiri was quite dry and hard. Then finally our side dishes came and those tasted really salty. I get that it's Vegas and they want you to buy more drinks but damn they need to cut back on the salt on certain things.   Overall, I felt that it was interesting spot to chill with friends and grab a quick bite. But for the price and quality of their dishes, I felt that I could get something better somewhere else. Maybe I'm just spoiled from sushi in the Bay Area and getting good sushi in the middle of a desert is hard to come by.",

Food was overpriced for the quality of the fish. Decor and ambiance was cute. I suppose a shift change was going on but we ended up with 3 different servers and service was extremely slow. The server to take down our order didn't our order down so our order got mixed up, we had to send some stuff back, and another server had to come out and triple checked that our order was correct. All in all, we got what we wanted with a couple of mix ups.  Rok n Roll 4/5 Unique roll, cucumber skin instead of rice. On the inside is salmon, tuna?, and spicy krabmeat with a ponzo drizzle I believe. Pretty good roll, came with 5 rolls on a toothpick skewer.  Sake(salmon nigiri) 3/5 $5 for a (1) nigiri. Very small piece of sushi. (30%)Fish to (70%)rice ration.  Salmon avocado cut-roll 3/5 Very simple basic cut roll. Can't say its bad but cant say its good. It is what it is.  Entertaining to be inside because they do performances and has a host that takes sake bombs with you. Food needs some improvements though.",

Loved the \"My Prerogative\" I sipped on; it was alcoholic but a bit sweet.   Next came the Edamame Rok and Shishito Peppers ($9 each). The peppers were a wee overdone but very smokey and had a great charring to them. The Edamame Rok was perfectly garlicky. Both had enough spice for me and not too much for my date.   Let me cut to the chase.   The Tiger Roll was flavor-packed and dense. The ROK and Roll had  a perfect spice-level and took more than one bite; very sexy. Huge servings, too.   The Hanger Steak was sooo tender. And that damned edamame puree was... Id've licked it off the plate if I was alone. It was just grainy enough and rich as all hell. Mmmm.   God, but that Citrus Miso Chilean Seabass!? Perfectly cooked, thick-ass tender filet of flaky fish. Just so stacked and moist. The foam atop was deliciously oceany but damn buttery too. Ugh. I'm dying to have it again.   Leilani, our lovely server, had to run from time to time. She was a fabulous dancer and I was happy to let her do her thing while I wiggled through my dinner. (I wiggle when I'm happy).   Though I wasn't expecting a grand show, neither my date or I were bothered. It got loud; it got tacky; I had fun.

Loved how he worked the room and made everyone feel welcome! He really set the tone and put everyone in a partying mood. I was in awe of his energy and improv skills. He's extremely talented and has a real gift for working a room. (I don't remember his name but he had shoulder length reddish brown hair.) Anyway, our dining experience was wonderful. The chicken entree with pureed sweet potato was delicious. The cocktails were also impressive. Would gladly eat here again",

Meaning 1 piece of sushi was already 1 out of the 5 so ordering 5 each time was a hassle. Could be better if they just make however many we asked since it's a buffet. Order 5 pieces of sushi for 2 people every 10-20 minutes was annoying. Other than ordering process it was good.",

All plates we had were beyond too salty to even enjoy.   The bottle of sake we got was the worst sake we've ever had, being from Hollister CA.   And I think it just.. was too salt over all.   Matt and I had: Crispy rice appetizer - think of a 50 quarter sized rice about a centimeter high, soaked in a salty sauce, topped with spicy tuna.... may or hold off of the sauce? We actually asked to have it taken back and the waiter was more than welcome to take it off of our bill for us.   We also tried scallops here... unfortunately it was too salty as well. Decorated with green chives and a foam on top and veggies on the bottom.   Matt said if he didn't order a side of rice, the food would've not been eatable...   We had two rolls. I forget their names but both were on the spicy side. Salty as well.  I'm not sure if salt was accidentally spilled on our food or.... people don't mind it but we literally left half of our food.   Mind you, it came to about a $110 bill including tip... for mediocre sushi.   There's too many employees standing around I feel like, just kinda staring at the dining room or people eating.. it's weird.",

When we went to Sake Rok for dinner on a Friday night, the music was blasting and there was an MC dressed in drag and singing and dancing to 90's pop hits around the tables, engaging the crowd. It was certainly fun and we loved singing along.  The prices are pretty mediocre - I didn't feel as robbed as I would have thought dining on the strip. We ordered the Japanese Wagu Sliders to start. Oh. My. God. I wish I had ordered one on my own so that I didn't have to share. The beef was truly delicate, tender and juicy and the truffle aioli granted me the power to see the face of God.  The sushi on the other hand, I found to be sub-par. To be fair, I lost the ordering game on this one because I tried my friends' rolls and theirs were all better than mine (I don't even remember the name of the roll I ordered) but none of them were very good. I didn't find them to be very fresh and I thought the rice was a little too tough. The only reason I'm giving this SUSHI restaurant 3 instead of 4 stars is because of the beef sliders and the super fun singing and dancing... counter-intuitive. I know.",

The inside of the sushi bar had a underground Japanese bar vibe to it - I can only image how lively it got at night!   The food was great! We ordered the shrimp ceviche and brussel sprouts as appetizers and we're not disappointed. The ceviche was good but with only (4) pieces and a party of 3, we had to fight to see who would get the last piece haha. The brussel sprouts were AMAZING and that's coming from someone who swears against eating them. It tasted like they were dipped in eel sauce and covered with Panko bread crumbs. Seriously. try them out you won't regret it. For entrees we ordered the volcano roll (5 pieces), rok & roll (5 pieces), and tiger roll (8 pieces). They were all good (I've had better) although, I favored the volcano roll the best. We also had a side of Japanese style elote and that was decent as well but definitely not as good as traditional Mexican elote. Nothing too amazing.   Service was alright considering the place was nowhere near being packed for lunch time.   It was a good lunch but can get pretty pricey for just lunch so keep that in mind. (2) appetizers, (3) rolls, (1) side, and tap water for 3 people. Spent about $124 (that's including tip - $104 before tip). I hear the dinners are entertaining so maybe check it out during that time!",

    "text": "I went here for a pre-show dinner before JT's Man of the Woods tour. It was a good idea that I made reservations on Open Table because it was busy, even at 6pm on a Sunday. (Excitement of our Vegas Golden Knights fans, mixed with JT/Nsync fans).  We were seated in the 2nd level, which allowed us to see the show. This is a lively, interactive dining experience. I was kinda prepared for it, since there is a disclaimer/warning on the restaurant's website. There was a emcee, dressed up in rocker Japanese garb, who did sake bombs with a table whenever they were ordered. My favorite part of the act was the Nsync vs. Backstreet Boys medley they performed. All the wait staff do the dances along with the emcee. It was fantastic.  I wish I could say the same for the food. If you are a sushi fanatic, this is not the place for you. It was underwhelming. For the appetizers, we ordered pork gyoza, edamame, and shrimp/vegetable tempura. My one friend ordered miso soup. These were all pretty basic. They forgot our edamame. One friend ordered shrimp tempura roll, the other ordered more temura, requesting all sweet potato, which they accommodated. She also ordered a cocktail, assisted by our server's recommendation, claiming her choice was great, since she likes fruity drinks. My friend said that was not the case when she tasted it. She wished it was more sweet. For my main course, I ordered sake (salmon sashimi). It was highway robbery (in my opinion) to pay $5/piece. I got 2. It tasted the way it's supposed to. I was probably more excited to eat it since it was my first sushi since I had surgery 4 months ago.   I supposed, since we were on the Strip, that is the reason for the exorbitant prices. We decided to split the check in 3-ways, which amounted to $30/pp, including tip. Ridunkulous if you ask me. As my friend pointed out, it was more out of convenience that we chose this restaurant, as it was a stone's throw away from T-Mobile Arena.   Personally, I would not go to this establishment again. I will find another place to eat in The Park before my next concert.",

Not only did they have great food and drinks, the atmosphere was so fun! It is basically a live performance while you eat! That night I was happy they sang great 90's hits like Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Their dancing was awesome too! I had so much fun dancing, eating, and being with my girls.

The inside is bright, lively, and fun! Our waitress was a blonde with long hair. She greeted us right away and complimented me on my attire. She was very friendly and attentive, stopping by the table multiple times to chat! Between the two of us, we split a lunch special sashimi assortment which was a killer deal for such huge pieces of fish! It also came with a side of miso soup or salad.  Our waitress also recommended the Japanese peppers, the rok shrimp tempura which was amazing, and the rok chicken which is their spin on a teriyaki chicken. It took a little long to come out but it was absolutely with the wait. Our waitress apologized many times and surprised us with mochi at the end. Overall, we left very full and very happy! We will definitely be back!",

After taking this up with the management the manager said he will check on us to make sure everything is OK. Which he never did. There were 4 extra shots charged on our $800 bill. Never go here unless you want to be treated rude and charged extra for it. The food was decent at best. Good luck if  you decide to go here.",

Overpriced, but hey its Vegas. What I did not like was the service. We were greeted by a miserable hostess, who cheered up when she learned me and my girlfriend were there for EDC. We had a bus boy tell us how they have been open a couple months, things were up and down, and he hates his job. And correct me if I am wrong, but our server does not believe in smiling or anything beyond a monotone pitch. Our entrees came out first - then our appetizers which took and abnormal amount of time for not being busy at all. They got our order wrong and forgot a seaweed salad, which we ended up canceling because it actually tasted disgusting.",

Tiger Roll and the special Wagyu roll were great.   I really like the idea of this place as they try to entertain with the wait staff doubling as dancers and an MC/host. We ate a bit early on a Thursday night so it wasn't overly lively yet but we could see the potential. We went with it and did some sake bombs and chatted up the host who was very nice. We will definitely come back and recommend it to our friends.",

It was late afternoon so we had a lighter meal, which was easy to do because of the excellent selection and wide variety of options (a full course meal or smaller plates with lighter fare). I had the roasted brussel sprouts (sans bacon, which was actually offered when I ordered them and I thought was an attentive gesture) and lemon roasted asparagus as well as steamed mixed vegetables and they were all exceptional. The roasted sprouts were really out of this world in flavor and texture. The portions were excellent as well. Given the variety of options there are plenty of meat as well as vegetarian options. My friend had the shrimp and rice and enjoyed both of these offerings. The shrimp sauce was unique and delicious. The staff were all extremely attentive with water glasses and drink glasses filled without us even noticing. The waitress made some menu suggestions that were spot on upon request and made the experience really exceptional. I will definitely come back especially during the evening hours when the entertainment and notable drink options will only enhance the already great experience. Congratulations on a wonderful and unique Vegas hotspot for visitors (and locals like myself)!",

    "text": "Big disappointment. My husband and i came here for my birthday dinner after seeing the good reviews here. We had a reservation and still had to wait for our table. So we got drinks at the bar while we waited. My husband let the bartender know it was my birthday, the bartender said he would let our server know about my birthday. Thats cool, although my husband already told them about my birthday when he made our reservation. When we got to our table we waited a good 5-10 minutes for the waitress. She said the hostess didn't let her know that we had sat down which is why it took her so long to take our order.   We ordered our food and ate it once it arrived. The food was good (but I think this place should be $$$ instead of just $$ because it was definitely on the pricier side). Meanwhile the DJ was going around to tables giving birthdays shots. He never came to our table. Our check arrived so my husband specifically told him again that it was my birthday and the server replied saying he would come back with a shot. He came back with just our processed credit card payment. At that point we had had enough.  I felt bad because my husband was trying to make my birthday special and told the restaurant multiple times about it, yet they didn't acknowledge it (but acknowledged it for others).  Between that, the slow service and the price, we definitely won't be recommending this place to friends. At least we had a great show after the disappointing dinner.",

The food was excellent, the prices high and the service poor. Maybe our waiter was new or just having a bad night but whatever the reason we had poor service. Lost 1/2 our order, food came out sporadically and even got our beer order screwed up. I did notice the three bachelorette parties got a lot of attention and seemingly great service.

The host/entertainer was so fun! He came by the table with a sake bomb, made everyone join in on the fun of me and my wife taking our first ever sake bomb.. (If you haven't tried it do so asap) every half hour or so they do a pretty cool routine of dancing and singing which is pretty much on point and you can't take your eyes off of haha as for the food.... DELICIOUS!!!! My wife and I had a couple rolls of sushi, some oysters, and the edamame. Then out comes a Godzilla platter breathing smoke with a ton of sushi rolls on it..... what an experience! There really isn't another place in Las Vegas like this one!

We've never seen anything like this. The atmosphere is like a big party, the servers would break into a Vogue dance and boyband lip syncs out of nowhere but not in a kitschy way. It was pretty much my dream come True. Most surprising to us was the food. We had a mushroom dish the waitress suggested (can't remember the name) and everyone at our table loved it - even though half don't even eat mushrooms. Half our group went to Nobu, we came here and I can honestly say the quality of the sushi and hot food was comparable. No exaggeration. The Girl on the Beach, El Chopo, the scallops. Yum, yum, yum. I'm sure there were more because everything surprised us. I almost forgot....the best part was the MC. He was hysterical and we couldn't take our eyes off him- a real character. We stayed until 2am. Not our normal thing to do! Going back next time in Vegas and will update about service. Sake Rok, sake bomb!",

    "text": "This was seriously one of the most fun and interactive dining experiences I've ever had! If you like to have fun, eat good food, and interact with a talented staff, then this place is for you. If you're boring, judgmental of others having a good time, and like to be a stick in the mud and don't like to see others having fun, then this may not be the place for you. All the servers are super nice and are amazing dancers. During our visit, they randomly went into choreographed dances of \"Vogue\" and other hits of the 80s and 90s. There's an MC who is fun and friendly and walks around interacting with the guests. There's a huge screen that plays music videos and clips of movies that pertain to what the servers are dancing to. The food is really good and fresh. I liked the beef tataki sashimi the best. The shishito peppers are good too. We had two bottles of the house cold sake which was delicious. Even my friend who claims she doesn't like sake really liked it! To top it off, the servers pulled me on stage to dance with them during the song \"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\" This place is a blast and will get you pumped up before a night out at a club or it's a great destination as it turns into a late night bar/lounge. It's in the brand new area called The Park in between Monte Carlo and New York-New York. It's just a few hundred feet off the strip in front of the T-Mobile Arena on a clean and classy street. I highly recommend this place for a great time!",

If you go, ask about their fancy drink that arrives in a glass case with smoke coming out! Wish I could remember the name of it. You must try this place! I regret not getting any pictures!",

We had shrimp for appetizers and then had sushi rolls (Volcano Roll, Cucumber Maki (veggie), and the Colorful Roll (asked to make it veggie). They were accommodating of the fact that my wife is a vegetarian and, she really enjoyed the rolls she had.  This is a trendy, hipster place to enjoy a meal. We went around 5pm, and it was starting to get crowded, and the one downside was that there was just 1 waiter to take everyones orders. But, they were still very quick and had great service.  Overall, I think the food was really good, and if I am in Vegas again and crave Japanese food, I would definitely come back.",

The volcano roll is baked and has the perfect amount of spiciness. The puff the Magic Dragon roll has suds (?) on the top. Don't worry. Whatever it is, it's edible and doesn't have a flavor. We also had the shrimp and vegetable tempura. I had the Dragonfly cocktail and enjoyed it a lot, but something in it made my lips tingle. The server brought over the alcohols used in the drink, but we were unable to determine what it was that caused the tingling. Also, about every 30 to 45 minutes, the staff puts on a performance/show with the staff dancing and singing and running around the restaurant so be prepared for that. If you want a laid back, intimate vibe where you can have conversation, this restaurant is too energetic and hype for you.",

We ordered a roll and three small dishes and they were all delicious. Our favorite was the charbroiled brussel sprouts!! Sooo bombbbb! From the outside, the decor looked like a pretty cool modern, hip Japanese theme. Sake ROK is a must to try when you're in vegas!  So adding on and updating my review. I LOVE SAKE ROK! My first visit I didn't eat inside since it was a beautiful day outside but since then, I've gone back and have eaten inside the restaurant. Such an amazing atmosphere. The staff are fun and entertaining with their random breakouts of choreography and the emcee singing along to fun dance songs. Our server TARA is my FAV! Attentive to her table, friendly and a great dancer too! Thanks SAKE ROK for always making my experience enjoyable! I always recommend you to friends looking for a Japanese spot with a fun environment.",

We all shared 3 of their Sushi rolls, none of which were a standout, just ok. Their real star was the Brussel sprouts. Holy Moly!! They came with a phenomenal tasting sugary Bacon topping which made them hard to resist. We had three orders amongst the three of us and still wanted more.  Probably would give this place three stars but the brussels sprouts were worth seven stars (Best Brussel sprouts I have ever had), so will round up to four stars.   Service was a little slow, but our waitress made up for it with friendliness and with a good attitude. Dancers were somewhat entertaining (they dance every 30-40mins).",

Also, they put sugar in the wasabi. All things considered, that might be a safety measure. No harm, no foul. And there's entertainment -- a DJ with a band of sorts and a geisha (who really put the gay in geisha). It was fun! Not what I was expecting (quiet place with samisen music) but what was I thinking? This is the Vegas strip! Of course it's not low key! One comment: the water tastes a little hinky - mineral... A small investment in a carbon filter would go a long way. But who the hell actually drinks water on the strip? Lol Spendy, but worth a go.",

Wtf!  Really?  You're an idiot!  It's simple, either the waitress forgot to put the order in or the chef is a complete baboon!  Needless to say, the entire group will share this bad experience and we will not return as locals that enjoy different places. Try again Sake Rok!",

For a $50 drink and a decent sized drink menu, you'd think they'd be on top of it.   Our food also took forever to come out. Our party of 3 ordered two starters and 3 sushi rolls. The crispy rice and the baked crab hand rolls were really good. The sushi rolls (volcano, el chapo and tiger) were good but I've had better sushi in Vegas. Our waiter Seth was so nice, always checking in throughout the night. I've given 4 stars because the food and drinks tasted good, it was entertaining and the manager did give us 30% off our drink because of how long it took.

Great atmosphere, intriguing music. All is well so we decide to order drinks. Right on time our server approached us and what happened next was life changing. At first it was her energy. Ever positive and relentlessly magnetic. Then she smiled and everything I thought I knew about life was shattered. Every movement is like a dance,  carefully choreographed to seduce and tantalize. Every word she spoke was delivered with such heavenly grace and elegance that it made me believe in God.   I don't remember much about what happened after that. The moment seemed to last forever, yet somehow ended far too soon. The next thing I know I'm back at home in Arkansas but all I can think about is her...   Food no longer tastes sweet or savory. Music doesn't captivate me the way it once did... the only thing my heart desires is Tara. My husband offered to dress like her and even let me call him Tara, but it's not the same.",

There was a huge projector screen on the wall playing the game, which I thought was cool. The waitress greeted us and handed us gigantic menus! We were interested in trying their sushi and asked what she recommended. We took her suggestion and ordered the Tiger Roll, as well as the Pan Seared Scallops. Both were delicious and the food presentation was definitely aesthetically appealing. The sushi was so good I forgot to take a picture, but here's a picture of the scallops :P",

To say this was a simple mistake that they \"forgot\" to put our order in really doesn't sit well with me, I'd understand after 15-20 minutes of sitting there with nothing being delivered but this went on for an hour.  If the staff was even remotely attentive (drinks had to be ordered twice) someone would have caught on relatively quickly, I honestly don't remember seeing our server again after placing my order.  At the point that we were just being tossed whatever food they had at the ready (none of it was what anyone ordered) it was obvious to us that we needed to leave.  After just arriving in Vegas, getting all dressed up for our first night on the town, we chose this restaurant to set our 4 day adventure off right...  but instead we walked out angry, frustrated, insulted and a bit embarrassed.  Whether the restaurant management would like to admit it or not, the treatment of our respectably dressed Crossdressing group came across as Extremely Discriminating!  To send the entertainer to apologize and talk to us, not the management itself is simply unacceptable.  NOT the way we wanted to start our week!  Our Annual gathering accounts for over 300+ people from 9 countries, as organizers we help all the newer girls (as well as the veterans) with recommendations of restaurants, shows, etc... I see no reason why Sake Roks would ever make that list, not after how mistreated we felt.  As for the food...  after spending an hour and a half in this establishment I have no idea how anything taste.",

Food and drinks come out sporadically. Nothing comes out together. Two people at our table got their entrees 20 mins after the first one came out, and the very last thing to arrive? Rice. Are you serious? You couldn't scoop the rice into a bowl for 30 minutes?! SLOW slow and slower. Friends steak was served rare. She asked our server if she could please cook it more, as she ordered it cooked medium? Server replied, So do you want it WELL DONE? Um, no. I'd like it cooked medium. Manager came to apologize. Manager had to come over to apologize last time we were there too. Last visit it was just two of us at the sushi bar and two items we ordered never did come and it was time to go to the game. They were sorry. Yep, you sure are. Yawn. Not recommended.",

We ordered edamame, which was listed as a starter and is typically served before sushi, but we did not get it until the end of the meal after reminding our waitress. Although we were just a table of two, and didn't have the biggest bill, it was apparent that our waitress was catering to those with a larger bill and didn't check-in throughout the meal unless we flagged her down for refills on water or to check on our food. All of that being said, Sake Rok was a great and fun way to kickstart our Saturday night and Vegas, but the service does leave something to be desired.",

I look around and it's not super fancy plus there was like only 2 other people in the entire restaurant. Anyhow my friend tells her not to worry the wrap turns into a dress to and she covered up.  We were seated and our waiter came along 2 mins later order drinks gave us menus. So we were so hungry and wanted to order it all. The one thing that caught my eye was the shishito peppers which I had to try.  Ordered the shishito peppers, edamame rok with asian garlic butter & chili, El Chapo Roll, Volcano Roll and Tiger roll. They ALL were a hit and taste was so good.  Now after we got our food it's like all the waiters went to hide in the back we were not asked for refills on drinks nor could we find anyone to get the check.

    "text": "VEGAS BABY!!!!!  About a year ago, I had a brief business lunch during my stay in the city of sin and conventions.  I was impressed with the quality of the food, the service and the decor.  This isn't your typical traditional sushi joint, where the decor makes you want to sleep.  I knew I had to come back and check it when the sun goes down and the sin city comes alive.  This past Saturday night, my friend Carlos was able to set up dinner reservations for Saturday night, for me and my lovely wife.  Figure we could have some drinks and delicious food prior to heading out to a nightclub.  Not only did we get to enjoy delicious food and drinks (One Night Stand Bombs are a must), but we also got a show.  You get to enjoy a interacting experience in which there is a DJ, the staff dances and performs.  I am going to embrace my millennia status and note that the place was LIT!!!  This is definitely the perfect place to come and have a great dinner prior to going out, or just make it your place to have fun the entire night.  Food wise \"El Chapo\" is a must and their delicious Tacos are the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>  If you are in the city, this a must.  Other perks, are the location (right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena) and other cool bars to partake prior or before your time there.  Contact my buddy Carlos for reservations: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fcarlitosway78&s=520eba5afda92dfc76346f7c5b5b7dbc0628058eb19b8a7c5c10ee349fcef4cb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/carlitoswa...</a>.",

My husband and I made a 9:00 reservation and a few minutes before 9:00 called the restaurant to let them know we were running about 5-10 minutes late. The hostess on the phone then promptly informed us that we wouldn't be seated due to a private event taking place that evening. We reached the restaurant itself just a minute or two later and asked to speak to the manager on duty. He offered to seat us but said in so many words that we would be kicked out within an hour to make room for the private party. When at that point we pointed out that either we should have received a call beforehand notifying us of the schedule conflict, or that a 9:00 reservation should not have been given out in the first place, he had no explanation. He simply said to come back tomorrow night and he would \"take care of us.\" Whatever that means. No discounts, coupons, or incentives offered for us to return to the restaurant besides this likely entirely BS promise. Bottom line, you have hundreds upon hundreds of fabulous restaurant choices in the Las Vegas strip, so any restaurant arrogant enough to not work to earn your business doesn't deserve it.",

    "text": "We went to Sake Rok our last night in Vegas and to celebrate a friend's 29th birthday. The atmosphere is super lively and they made sure to acknowledge my friend's birthday in a special way. Shout out to our waiter DJ and all the additional waiters that came over throughout the night! They all provided excellent service!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for a group ages 20-40. They have a dj that played music all night and every hour or so the wait staff broke out in a dance routine. It was very entertaining and fun! We had a group of 7 people. Throughout the evening we ordered round after round of sake bombs $6 a piece (Don't be fooled by the 8 sake bombs for $80). For appetizers, we started with edamame, dumplings and brussel sprouts. The dumplings were good but the brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS! Each person at the table ordered a specialty roll and then we tacked on several of the hand cut rolls. The hand cut rolls were small and nothing extraordinary. Exactly what you would expect. The specialty rolls were very unique! We ordered almost every one on the menu but my favorites were Spicy Samurai (beware very spicy), Tiger Roll, Puff the Magic Dragon (comes with edible white foam on top). Since we had a birthday girl they brought out their signature Honey Toast! It was delicious! We also had the mochi which I thought the shell was too gummy... nothing special. Overall very entertaining/unique dining experience and the price isn't bad either. We had about 6 rounds of sake and most people also ordered a beer + food shook out to about $65 per person + tip.",

There is definitely a high energy ambience with the music playing and dj there, plus once about every 30 to 45 minutes the crew breaks out into a very well choreographed dance. The service was very attentive (and our server was very sweet!) and the food was really good.  We shared their spicy miso soup as a starter and it was delicious, my boyfriend got the spicy samurai roll and thought it was good,but I had the miso black cod and it was probably the best fish I've ever had! This place was a lot of fun with good food and we'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night out.",

    "text": "OMG! Again, I relied on Yelpers in selecting Sake Rok. Those Yelper's who said the music was loud just made it more intriguing for me. Wonderful rustic atmosphere located in The Park between off Las Vegs Blvd.Jessica at front desk gave me directions there -- twice. You'll have a bit of a walk to get there, because its by NYNY and Shake Shack. 3 levels although I didn't go to 3. I think its for people who want quiet (I dont know for sure). Walking in I didnt see people w/food, so assumed service was slow. Just the opposite; service was fast, but people hung around drinking.  Amanda was my server. Very pleasant and attentive. I had the ginger cosmo and LIT (long-island tea) Great!.  Had edaname and shrimp apps. Chose the ElChopo roll. All very good. Perhaps the best part was the high-energy music  (Prince, MJ, etc.) There is a DJ and a lead 'hype man' who works the room messing w/folks, wishing happy b-day, etc. The staff does synchronized dances every 15 minutes or so. Very entertaining! The red-head young-looking owner who informed me they had only been open a few months. I suggested he come to Milwaukee.",

    "text": "Food was good but I was not impressed by the service.  We placed our order for a party of 4, received and ate half of our orders and our drink orders had still not shown up. We managed to get our waiters attention and remind him that we had not received our drinks yet( 2 sake bombs and a beer). He said he was going to retrieve them as well as a side dish we added on.  Side dish made it out but no drinks. Shortly after ,we had finished our meal so we stopped the first employee to walk by us and ask that he please cancel our drink orders as we are ready to go. 5 minutes later here comes another employee with our drinks, I tell him that unfortunately we are ready to go and I had informed another employee of this and asked to have the order cancelled as we had already been waiting 30 minutes for these. His response? \"I DON'T THINK SO! I haven't even been here thirty minutes but let me get you a manager because umm they're already made\". Now, I really don't care what you THINK, I KNOW how long we have been there and how long we have been waiting. That response was totally unnecessary. I get things happen and in this case most likely our server forgot to put our drink order in. A simple I'm sorry about that let me talk to my manager and see what's going on would have sufficed instead of the snarky comment. Manager came over and apologized and offered to have the drinks made to go for us. We declined and he graciously said he would have no problem taking the drinks that we did not have off the bill(thank you!) I did let him know his employees response was unwelcome but alas, the damage was already done. With the wide variety of restaurants in this city just having good food is not enough, service has to be just as good. Would not go out of my way to come here again.",

Not only were they able to get us in quickly, the food and atmosphere were amazing!  It is unfortunate that Las Vegas has gotten away from its hospitable nature, luckily Sake Rok delivered exceptional service throughout our entire dining process.... extremely refreshing!  Also I love to see when managerment is partaking in the most smallest of tasks to help alleviate stress from its servers. On numerous occasions, I witnessed the Assistant General Manager bussing tables, checking in with guest and was always visible on the floor! If you are looking for a great date spot, or somewhere to have fun after an event, Sake Rok will not disappoint.  I will definitley be back in the future.",

    "text": "We were not at Sake Rok during a peak time, it was for an early dinner, so only 2-4 other people were dining when we were there. I agree with another reviewer over the snooty hostesses but the one that seated us was nice enough. The place was over-staffed for it being so slow (probably ahead of a potential rush) but it appeared as though a lot of the staff were watching and talking about the diners. Even if they weren't, that's how it felt. Our server was nice and the kitchen was very accommodating to my allergy and double-checked that similar ingredients were alright for me. I greatly appreciated this attention to detail and the chefs even relayed some questions as well to make sure they prepared something I could eat. Our beverages were refilled often and our food took an appropriate amount of time to prepare. The coconut rice came out first and it was absolutely delicious. We'd hesitated in ordering a starter but I am so glad we ordered it. I'm still thinking about it! Our sushi rolls (Avocado, Tiger and I'm Filled With Cream) were all fresh and tasty. The ingredients were all evenly balanced within each roll. We weren't there during any of the live performances or aware they had them but did see one of the male performers in makeup on our way out. In short, the waiter, kitchen manager (?) and cooks were all great. 1 hostess was decent. The weird vibe was from the seemingly-gossipy other employees on the clock that may very well have just been bored. I'd still return. *this review posted on multiple sites",

She proceeded to drink it until her mouth started feeling weird. She decided to go to the bar to ask and guess what....it had pineapple in it!!!

We also had shrimp tempura rolls and salmon tempura roll. Us four women shared a \"bowl.\" $50 bucks for a gigantic mixed drink - all of us had plenty. Additionally, if you get the chance, do a Sake bomb with the crew. So fun. Highly recommend for both food and entertainment.",

So another got me to a table. Then over the loudspeaker someone was asking how we are all doing. Minutes later, an MC like figure shows up. It was Ru Paul or at least someone who looked like him. Madonna's \"Vogue\" plays on the speaker and the servers start dancing . I wondered if an audition was included in their job interviews  I wanted to have a light dinner so I had Miso soup, my favorite nigiri and one of their special rolls. I thought the entertainment was awesome. Some customers were invited to dance, not I unfortunately but then again I might have done something unconventional. After all I was in Vegas. The servers were very helpful, attentive and did I mention entertaining . The food was a little pricey but then again I was in Vegas . I have a such a wonderful experience there that I told my best friend, who lives in Italy, that the next time he visits the US we come to Vegas. So we could come here more than once . When I left the restaurant I was such in a great mood and that stayed with me for the rest of the evening. Thank you Sake Rock",

The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there.   We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor.   If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest.",

    "text": "So, were do I start?  Compliments, the chopsticks where really nice.  The busboy with the beard was very nice to look at.  We got here at 6 pm and got our food at about 7pm.  Well, let me clarify, we received out edamame at that time. We ordered a round of drinks and they took a very long time to come out.    At about 6:50 pm the server Rich T, came up to us and apologized that our order was not put in because the tables were wrong.  I have no idea what that meant.  Then he asked if he could offer us some sake.  No one in our table ordered sake.  So we did not respond.   Our food started to come out at about 7 pm.   And by food I mean our two rolls and our edamame.  My friend ordered a drink which was awful and advised the server to please replace it.  We had to remind him twice and had to get a manager to get get out the new drink.   He offered us sake again, at this point we just said okay.   The server came came back to see if we needed anything else about 7:35pm.  At which time we inquired about the rest of our order, specially our scallops.  He made a face and ran into the kitchen.  Clearly, the rest of the order was not placed.    We waited about 10 more minutes.  The order never came.  We flagged Rich down to advise him that we needed to leave and to please cancel the rest of the order.  My friend went to the manager to share his experience and was told sorry.  The check came and had items that never came.  I understand they they just opened but no one knows where the food goes.    I would not recommend this restaurant at all.  Fun atmosphere great music.   I would have loved to taste the food but it never came.  If you want cocktails and if you wanna watch servers dance, please have a few drinks.  But it was about 7pm and they ran out of items on their main menu for drink.   We had to order different items.    We requested for a male manager this time after speaking to Raika, he also apologized and stated they were not making excuses.     Our bill for 4 drinks a 3 apps was $181.   Overpriced, extreme lack of service and management had no restaurant management experience.    It was 4 of us who work in the industry and we will not return.  Do not waste your money on this over priced place.",

    "text": "WARNING!!! Make sure to check your itemized bill before leaving the restaurant because I got overcharged ~$354.   Also, take note that even though you have items that are \"comped/adjusted\" you will still have to pay the 22% gratuity.  I really hate to do this because I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and have also been a manager, but the 1 star is for how the servers and management dealt with my bachelorette party of 23 people (only 20 people were able to consume alcohol).  I had an issue with my bill and it only got \"somewhat\" fixed after a month of emailing and calling the restaurant.  Here's the story...as soon as we got seated a server told us that we'd be getting a round of sake bombs for free,  I thought, wow that's awesome.  About halfway into dinner my friend said that he was gonna order another round of sake bombs.  I told him to make sure to only order 20 sake bombs because we have people in our party that don't drink alcohol or are pregnant (note: we didn't get carded by our servers which I think is a big no no since we had some guests who had just turned 21 and our servers would have realized that they were handing out supposedly \"comped sake bombs\" to pregnant women). When it was time to pay our bill, I asked our server if she could split it up with food on 1 bill, and alcohol divided by the 3 tables (total = 4 checks).  She kept on telling me that she can't do that because the max number or checks she could do is 4.  I was confused because I was just asking for 4 checks but let it go because we wanted to leave the restaurant already.  I paid the food bill and my other friend paid the alcohol bill.  After we had left the restaurant we were trying to figure out who owed what for the alcohol and realized that Sake Rok had charged us for two rounds of 25 sake bombs (50 sake bombs) even though we had only ordered 20 sake bombs.  And our server did not \"comp\" our first round.  After about a month of emailing management (and not getting a response half the time) I came to the conclusion that our server thought we had ordered a \"set\" menu which includes a free round of sake bombs.  Sake Rok ended up comping the sake bombs in the end but I, the bachelorette, got left with paying the 22% gratuity for the \"comped\" sake bombs (~$66) when we only had a party of 20/23 people that could drink and dealing with all the stress of contacting the restaurant when this wouldn't have happened if our server hadn't made the mistake of, first, not carding us and realizing only 20/23 guests would consume a \"comped sake bomb\" then probably realizing that we didn't order a set menu and had us pay for the bill anyway.  Management offered to reimburse me for the $66 gratuity for the \"comped\" sake bombs but told me it would take awhile because they would have to ask for the money back from the servers, which I think the restaurant should have reimbursed me the $66 without any hesitation.  Sake Rok really needs to make sure they ID all their guests, know how many people are in each party AND if all the guests want/can drink alcohol.  Most importantly make sure that when they offer \"comped\" drinks, that they \"comp\" it.",

A super fun dining experience. I went with my husband, but I think it would be even more fun to go with large groups. The food is awesome, though pricey. We got some oysters, one king crab leg, a couple of rolls (Tiger roll and tuna roll), and a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious!! I loved the atmosphere and want to go back for my birthday or anniversary.",

We are vegetarian and they have a number of choices and a separate vegan menu.  We ordered four items for a late meal.  Perfect. Small portions, but there is noting conventional about this restaurant or its menu, so it was fine.  The tasting portions were unique, full of flavor and just fit the ambiance. Sake bomb at half of the tables.  Suddenly, all of the servers are lip-syncing and dancing, led by the emcee and boy band music videos. A little pricey, but it's Las Vegas.",

We did make a reservation ahead of time, but I think we would have been fine either way. I love the look of the space, it's a modern and lively atmosphere. The staff is all very fun and they do little performances and dances randomly throughout your meal, which is super entertaining. They actually brought the birthday girl on stage to dance with them! They also have a girl that comes to your table to do Sake Bombs with you. It's really a fun experience! As for the food, we had a family style dinner and here is what we had: edamame with some kind of delicious chili sauce all over it, rock shrimp which was SO amazing, a mixed fish tartare type of appetizer with chips for dipping, 2 really great sushi rolls, a sliced chicken dish drizzled with some kind of teriyaki type sauce and bok choy on the side, and assorted mochi, in which one of the flavors was cookies and cream and it was amazing! Honestly every food item was delicious and full of flavor. Between the great food and the awesomely fun atmosphere, I absolutely loved this experience and I can't wait to come back!",

The nigiri sushi took at least 15-20 minutes PER order and the rice for the nigiri kept getting bigger and bigger! Ramen took 30 minuets and we had to inquire about it 3 separate times. We inquired about their signature honey toast and ordered the loaf but was served a single serving honey toast dessert. When we questioned it, the employee that brought out the single serving said \"that waitress usually doesn't work when that's served\". Not even an offer to correct the order. Coming all the way from Hawaii, what a disappointment.",

All of them were dancing and once they were done they went back to checking on their tables (impressive btw) lol. We got sat and our server Jenny is so sweet! We loved her and she was very welcoming and she even had a sense of humor and made us laugh all night. She recommended some appetizers and we loved everything especially the hamachi serrano. And after that we told her to bring us whatever she thought we'd like and it was all so yummy! Oh and they have an emcee! He was the life of the party. He was breakdancing on the stage and he was wearing heels too lol. We had the hamachi serrano, shishito peppers, miso black cod, el chapo roll, and tiger roll.

The server that cut me off was our server as well.  She wasn't friendly, forgot my boyfriends drink two times and my drink was delivered to the wrong table. (She watched from the bar as the person questioned if it was my drink) she wasn't sorry for the service thus far. We got our food and never checked on us one time to see how things were. just before we were done I realized I wanted to order more but before I could we were handed a bill.  I let her know I wasn't done and she said that the kitchen was already closed. The only thing good about this place is the ambience, but def not worth a dime! Ps her name is Jennifer",

But they actually have good food and great ambiance/entertainment here. The waiters get up and sing and dance, and the host does sake bombs with customers.  My waitress was very friendly; she could've slowed things down and been a tad bit more personable, but I cant really complain, she made some awesome suggestions.  They have good drinks and delicious shots too.  It's pricey, but on par with similar restaurants on the strip.  Most of the specialty rolls were around $19, drinks were $14 and shots were $10, and the nigiri sushi is $5 for one piece.  They really should have more reasonable prices for their shots and nigiri if you ask me, but I still enjoyed the experience.  Definitely the type of place you want to hit with a group of friends.",

Being in the restaurant business for 10 years, I believe that these guys make and bottle some sake that you can't do research on, charge an obscene about of money thinking that their clients will eat feces and pay the bill because they are too embarrassed to complain, and then shove it up your private region just because they think they can.  Please note a bottle of top rated Isojiman Junmai Ginjo is about 115$.  When the staff was confronted, they lied and said it's standard practice to mention the pricing. Now mind you, there were 5 business owners sitting at the table that spend an a ton of money that weekend without incident.   Would you ever spend $1400 on 2 bottles of sake worth 100$?  I thought not.  Then we spoke with the smug owner Todd, the type of guy who makes it a practice to sodomize his customers on over priced sushi, 200$ steaks, and $700 bottles of sake.  He sodomizes you without regret and actually enjoys your pain. Do yourself a favor, go to a real sushi restaurant with professional staff and stay away from  tourist traps like this because there is always a wolf waiting.  Some restaurants don't understand the value that clients like us bring, clients that have no problem spending a lot of money, but instead see it as an opportunity to defraud you and leave a terrible taste in your mouth, long after the after taste of their sushi is gone.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by saying the food was pretty tasty. However, the service from beginning to end was horrible. I went to have lunch at around 3pm the people at the front told me they had only a few selections available because they were transitioning to dinner. Then the hostess tells me they have the full menu available. That was a little confusing. We go in and sit down at a table (no one told us where to go or to sit) and someone came over and said the tables are closed we can only sit at the bar. After we sat down at the bar, we got the menu and started to browse. Our waiter said they on had the sushi menu open and that we couldn't order anything else. After much back and forth conversations with the manager they finally let us order from the \"hot plate menu\" as well. After we ordered, we over heard one of the chefs saying \"what table ordered the tuna tataki\" in a irritable voice. That's is just horrible fricken customer service. Chefs were standing around on their phone, talking and we were the only ones in there at the time! Our order took at least 30 minutes and let me tell you the portions are NOT worth the price. My first experience here was absolute crap. Staff sucked. They really need to reconfigure their image because they are sloppy as hell right now. Will never eat here again.",

You can definitely tell the place was nice. It struggled with its concept with its dinner and a show. They did dancing and some singing which I thought was unnecessary. We were celebrating a bachelor party for our friend and they brought him on stage for a lap dance which made everyone in the restaurant uncomfortable. There were servers that lingered around a lot. The food was really underwhelming compared to the prices. They recommended a seafood platter that was expensive on which the oysters tasted pretty standard,  crab legs that were bland and prawns were overcooked. Was not a fan of our appetitizers either; rok shrimp, some mushroom dish was nothing special. Only good thing was the wagyu tomahawk steak. Another thing that upset us was the $14 kirin large, it was more like a small for the price we paid. This place still needs a lot of work.",

We walked in and only 2 tables were taken but it took them awhile to find us a table. I don't understand that part. Once we sat down, it took about 10 mins for someone to acknowledge us to even give us a menu or water. They had a table of gentlemen that everyone was attending and entertaining (I believe they were distributors)...big mistake! Our waiter was not all there. I felt like it was the first day they opened because everyone was walking around dazed and confused. I expected it to be overpriced but don't mind if the quality is top notch, it was far from that. Food was not so good, pretty bland if I had to describe it. We had the ROK ceviche, rice tuna, hangar steak and the omakase. Only thing we absolutely loved was the sparkling SAKE and that's why they get 3 stars instead of 2.",

Once the \"server\" took our order, we realized she was only a runner ( yet did not tell us nor grab our server for us) and had to wait another 10 minutes for the actual server. The wrong food was delivered to our table on FOUR separate occasions with one time the runner telling us it was our edamame( again, we hadnt even been greeted at this point). There seemed to be at least 3 managers working the room, yet not one ever approached our table of 9 to see how we were doing. Some of our food came out within a reasonable amount of time, while others were served their food well after the group had already finished. We were celebrating a birthday yet the hostess never seemed to mention it to anyone so our birthday girl was ignored. Poor service all around. We will not be returning next time we are in Vegas.",

My friend and I are both locals who were excited to try a new place on the strip before heading in to T-Mobile arena. However, we were both severely disappointed. We were seated, and nobody came over to give us menus, or explain the setting to us. I had to ask one of the bussers/runners for menus. After a bit someone did come over and give us water.  We waited so long that one of the sushi chefs asked us if we'd received any service. The only thing that happened after that was the busser/runner tried to bring us a couple of giant sized menus.  Our server ignored us, while greeting and checking on other tables. At one point she stopped by and said she'd be right back (after her dance number), yet she disappeared. In fact, she only popped up after we flagged down a manager. After we got our food, the server then basically ignored us repeatedly. When we were nearly done with our meal, the server finally checked to see if we wanted more drinks, however, we declined because we figured we would never get them before we had to leave. My friend complained to the manager who did not do anything aside from give us his business card and tell us that he'd take care of some stuff if we come back. Great food, but such terrible service I'd be hard pressed to go back or suggest it to anyone.",

Jen also made a nice comment about a necklace she was wearing. That made her day!!  The food was delicious and the drinks were great as well. Great atmosphere.   Jen was so nice, it made the night so much more enjoyable!! My friend thought I paid her to give her the necklace compliment, but I told my friend she is just a sweet woman.

Though I am appreciative of the bartender in this case because he clearly didn't want to send out a bad Lily Pad. Still, it seems they have a bit more work to go. The wagyu sliders were delicious, the fish was fresh and tasty, and I really enjoyed my seaweed salad.

    "text": "So I was in town for the Rammstein concert, and wanted to get a bite to eat, but didn't want to have to walk 3,500 miles to find something decent. Luckily for me there was a food court right next door to the arena and that had a sushi place.  Now, I'm all about the sushi. And I do like a place with good ambiance. And this place seemed to fit the bill. So I went inside and was promptly seated.  The interior of the place is very trendy and hip looking and they had a DJ playing some decent tunes.  my waiter came by and I ordered a double Maker's Mark on the rocks.  The sushi seemed reasonably priced, until I was informed that the price for was one piece of sushi not two, which seems to be the industry standard. But I figured this is Las Vegas, industry standards do not apply.  So I ordered the least expensive roll on the menu, and five pieces of sushi. Let me say this, the food was good but the portions were really tiny. I thought I was in one of those high-end New York restaurants where they give you food that is about two clicks above microscopic.   That being said, the flavors were there, the presentation was top-notch, and the service was impeccable. I still have a hard time swallowing $5 a piece for sushi nigiri unless King Neptune himself brought it up, cleaned it and served it to me. Then I could have justified the cost. Sadly, Neptune was nowhere to be found, so I just have to chalk this one up to experience.  When the bill came after adding in tip, I walked out of there a little over $70 lighter, and I was still hungry. I have to figure that being next to an arena, restaurants can command a higher price. But there's a difference between a higher price, and boutique charging. I guess if you're trying to weed out a certain clientele, the price justifies the means.  Just to clarify one last time, the food was really good the service was impeccable and the place definitely had a great atmosphere. But damn, $5 minimum per piece of sushi nigiri seems way out of line to me.  I just can't in good faith give this place four or five stars.  The bottom line? If you are absolutely dying for some sushi, and you have nowhere else to go, this may be the only game in town around the T-Mobile Arena.",

Their is a bar facing the outside of the restaurant so we ordered there. The bartender was really cool, really friendly and told us all about their beers and drinks they had to offer. We decided to try a Japanese imported porter which turned out to be really good ($9 a can though). We had a good time people watching and hanging out during our last hour of our trip. Their food looks really good, hopefully we'll get a chance to try next time.",

    "text": "Probably the most fun dining experience I've had on the strip in YEARS!  From the minute you walk in, you feel like you've wandered into a post apocalyptic cirque du soleil set. Greeted by adorable hostesses, and met at your table by someone that's a cross between Chris Angel and someone from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, dinner at Sake Rock is an adventure, and NOT for the entitled shallow-hearted.   Ginormous cartoon-sized menus, boy band sing-a-longs, interactive diner participation complete with spankings (yes I was spanked....... and it was SOOOOOO delicious!), dancing waitresses (and they were GOOD dancers..... like holy-shit good!), wonderful singers...... ah the fun!  If you're uptight, boring, and have the personality of a bumper sticker, do yourself a favor, DON'T come! Stay home! Go find an all-you-can-eat buffet and smirk under your right-wing Stetson. Stay far away! They don't want you here!  Now.... the food is interesting. Some of the traditional sashimi is average to pretty good. They deliver. Then you move up the creative chain and sample the mixed rolls.... and if you have enough people, get the Godzilla platter, which comes out like champagne bottle service at Hyde or Hakassan nightclubs. This is Vegas-level sushi table service, complete with smoke-spewing Godzilla statue.  If you're a scallop lover, omg they have an amazing cooked scallop dish that led some of the people in my party to fight.   If you're a meat eater, you MUST try their Flintstones-sized bone-in ribeye that is good for 5-6 people. Holy cow..... pun intended.... amazeballs.   They have a full bar, and their array of cocktails will do any mixologist proud. I actually let my waiter decide for energize on the table simply based on 2-3 question about what we like or dislike. Winning!  So come here if you're looking for dinner fun. I'm rating the entire experience and \"smile\" factor. It is so much fun!!",

    "text": "You Rock Sake Rok!! Wooo!! You Go Glen Coco!! Hahaha! Sake Rok is KILLIN the game in ENTERTAINMENT dinning. Let me start by saying I was stalking this restaurant before it even opened thanks to Eater's column for new openings in Vegas. WOW am I glad this was a destination fulfilled!   Having only been opened for a month I was beyond ecstatic to try this place. Being in a good local was also a perk because I was able to experience the new Park and see the  new majestic Dancer statue! Upon entering, I loved the glowing lanterns that were on display in the foyer which immediately gave a vibrant electric feel against all of the dope graffiti art lining the walls. We did not have reservations and we were sat at the sushi bar which was fine but it was uncomfortable having to wiggle around in my seat to look back at all of the entertainment, which is why, I highly recommend you make reservations in advance!   We ordered: ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA  TEMPURA ROLL TIGER ROLL  Everything we had was amazing! The rock shrimp was an appetizer and a hefty portion was given. It was very spicy and crunchy and completely savory! The tempura isn't your average tempura roll. The entire roll was deep fried! Sinful! And my tiger roll was more a common roll but still delicious! I wouldn't recommend ordering too much tempura choices bc that's a lot of fried food for one sitting. 5 stars for food!   Vegas is the entertainment capital of the world and Sake Rock knows how to be that bold outlier, shameless in their performance, and all out flamboyant! Props to the David Bowie, kmono and spiky platform wearing, MC that kept the party rolling all night! Lights, camera, action, starting at 7:30pm and every half hour after, your severs will perform full out choreographed dances from Afro wearing MoTown to Lady Gaga Born This Way, and even Madonna Vogue! They wil throw money from the balcony! Dolla Dolla Billz Ya'll! They will stunt and be carried high in the air! I have no idea how organized and n'sync they stay from multi tasking, serving an entire restaurant and keeping up with all the dance moves, never spilling anything and always staying on beat! Shiz! Tip your sever well! They are straight up party gurus and the definition of work hard play hard!   The Restrooms are Unisex so Ladies don't feel weird walking into the bathroom with a male attendant. If you want privacy take care of fixing yourself up in your stall bc it can get a little weird in front of the communal mirror. I personally didn't like this. I was adjusting my dress at the communal sinks just as the male attendant was handing me a hand towel and it made for an extremely awkward moment. As well as a little uncomfortable. Then to make up for it the attended tried a go at small talk and I just wanted to get out of the bathroom. Lol. Smh. Fair waring.   Ranging about $60 for two people with non alcoholic drinks it's totally worth the visit. I recommend coming in a big group bc the MC will notice your table and get you up and dancing and take sake bombs with you and you can have a mini keg at your table! This place is almost better for groups than coming in as 2 people so invite the squad! If I could, I would totally quite my day job just to be a Sake Rok girl!",

My friend (who hates sushi/fish/seafood) got the Chicken Katsu Roll and absolutely loved it. The highlight was definitely the Toban Yaki, which is an amazing mushroom dish! The staff was extremely knowledgeable about allergies and food sensitivities and ways to accommodate several food restrictions. Highly recommend it!",

It was my first time there and I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away. The drinks are about $15 but were worth it.  We ordered our drinks and the music started to get louder and and singers and dancers came out of nowhere and put on a full rendition of Bruno Mars and even had the guest get up and get involved. The MC Cesare was the absolute Best!!! If you want a great dining experience this is the place to go. I ordered the king crab California rolls and they were delicious. I'm not sure what I loved more the food, the staff or the drinks. Go here you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The most stylish sushi experience you can get.  Sake Rok is a part time sushi restaurant, part time dance club that is oozing with flair.  Combining old style favorite Japanese dishes with inventive spices and seasonings give Sake Rok's distinct taste while their decoration and atmosphere make it unique even among the other themed restaurants in the Las Vegas strip.  Like most places on the strip, Sake Rok is a bit expensive, but if you want the most bang for your buck, I recommend the edamame appetizer, loaded with garlic, salt, and other spices and sharing a Sake Rok Ramen with someone.  The ramen is huuuuge and well worth the price.  Splitting an additional sushi roll makes for a complete meal with one of their many brands of sake as a great bonus.  For huge parties, try their Godzilla plate, with enough sushi for 6-8 (or less depending on how much of a sushi glutton you are).  Each plate is served on a custom made Godzilla tray, complete with a Godzilla figure that breaths smoke while you eat.  Sadly, you cannot take the tray home with you.  Sake Rok is open as early as lunch, but it's best to go during the evening.  At night, they blast dance music and switch on a projector showing social media and pop themed imagery and at night, all servers will break into synchronized dance at the random points through the meal.  Not only can your server dance, but they are all super friendly, able to make great recommendations and delve into the menu in full detail.  Get your clubbing and dinning experience wrapped up in one shot with Sake Rok's awesome blend of scenery and cuisine.",

Our concierge recommended this place and it was highly rated on Yelp too. It's located in The Park, which is in between New York New York and T-mobile arena.   The inside of the restaurant reminded me of NYC. Murals were painted on what looked like brick walls. There was a staircase that was reminiscent of fire escapes in NYC.   We ordered the El Chapo roll, the kamikaze roll, and a himachi and jalapeno roll. I have to admit the food took a long time to come out. I don't know how they would accommodate tables at peak dining times. I loved the El Chapo roll. It had a tiny slice of lemon on top of the roll, which offered a fresh taste. My husband liked the kamikaze roll the best. The himachi and jalapeno was great too. I loved the spice on it.   I've heard the dinner experience can be a lot of fun. A table near us was doing sake bombs. A video of other antics was playing on the wall. It's seems like a fun group experience.",

First of all, what the fuck is up with the menus?  They only supply one menu to the table and it is about 3' by 1.5' in size.  Ridiculous and inconvenient!  I had to lean this silly billboard on the side of my chair while trying to make sure it didn't fall to the ground the whole time.  Ever wonder why almost every other restaurant in the world gives individual menus to every patron?  Because, holy shit, (gasp) it works!!  Menu PDF on the phone, please.     Food clearly takes a backseat to alcohol and drink prices are respectable for the Strip.  $12 cocktails, $45 fish bowls (good for 4-6 people) and more than enough sake bomb chants to have you still hearing them the next morning ensure everyone can get as drunk as they want.  I wanted to get smashed as soon as I was seated.      This spot would be best suited for bachelorette parties.  The most entertaining performance by the staff was an NSync vs Backstreet Boys dance mash up that had me cracking up as soon as the puppet strings dropped down from the second floor.  Just because this isn't my scene doesn't mean I can't appreciate what they're at least shooting for :)    I'd probably go with one of the food packages at the bottom of the menu if I were to return since they're better value, but if a decent Japanese-ish dinner is what you're after, consider at least five other spots on Las Vegas Blvd.",

The toro sushi was so good and fresh as was the yellow tail and salmon. The spicy tuna roll wasn't nearly as good as the sushi but still decent. You can imagine that the service was spotty with our waitress breaking to jump into a song and dance - but the management felt so bad that we had to wait so long that they took care of a large part of our drinks. Wouldn't definitely recommend - but it is a party atmosphere so be prepared.",

Asked us to come in for lunch the next day and we were given a ton of appetizers on her.  We had so much food but ate it all cause it was so good! This place is an absolute must when you're in Vegas!!!",

Upon arrival we wondered why it wasn't its usual busy, bustling self....  within 10 minutes, we knew exactly why....  an entire new team, from front of house, wait team, and most importantly, a new \"host\"!  And that is probably the biggest mistake.  The best part of Sake Rok has always been the interaction between the amazing servers and both Janus or Caesar as hosts....  with them all gone (no idea why) the place is dead!   'Foot\" talking about his wife, just doesn't work for us!!! Why change the menu? Food was just blah.....  I predict that it won't be long before we all say bye, bye, bye to Sake Rok Sadly messed with success here, and lost a couple of regulars",

Of course I've had better sushi at more authentic restaurants but for what it is, I very much enjoyed the food. The host is very interactive and definitely made my dinner experience so much more Vegas-like! Only downside is they close super early, even on weekends. I was having such a good time I wasn't ready to leave yet! Especially because they play such great music and have such awesome cocktails.",

I want to say that the performer was on one and it was such a great act. He did the most and got everyone lit up at the tables! One of the funniest things was that he called me out on taking pictures of the food LOL. By the way, I want to give him a shout out for hooking us up with free drinks and Sake Bombs! Pretty much every table did a Sake bomb hahaha!   We ordered a few rolls actually and had some appetizers! It was actually pretty pricey for sushi. A roll was almost 20 dollars, a sashimi was 5 dollars. It's a bit pricey here but It's Vegas, you'll have to understand that lol. Food was great, no complaints there.  The Beef Tataki was freaking amazing, very small portion but packed a powerful punch. Very vivid in flavors, I wish they gave us more!!! I recommend this dish 10/10 times. Actually, all of our appetizers were on point. We also had shishito peppers, it was not as spicy as I thought it was but this was such a well put dish! Brussel sprouts, delicious, if you love brussel sprouts you won't regret it!   For our sushi, we ordered tempura roll and the volcano roll. I love them both because their eel sauce on both roll gave it justice. I don't know how they made that sauce but it was bomb! Everything was put together. Like I said the portion was pricey and it was only a few pieces. Salmon Sashimi was ok but it was all enjoyable after a few shots of sake!  Great vibe, service and overall fun time here.",

Dancing salsa, some group dancing, and live singing.  All of this and we hadn't even looked at the menus yet. Overall impressed by the opening.  For the food, the prices are a bit high for sushi, but it's Vegas for you. The nigiri is SINGLE PIECE, not typical two pieces, so be wary of that.  Otherwise, a great place to go!  Surprisingly, they had the best miso soup in a while.  For food we had the following: Edamame, shishito peppers Tempura Vegas GODZILLA SUSHI PLATTER  They did a great job with everything. The edamame had rock salt it - delicious  Those Veges hit the spot - lots of squash and onions with Bok Choy.  As for the sushi platter, there was a huge selection. It's about $200 for the plate, but there was more than enough food on it to share for 4-5 people. There's about 5 rolls, and then 6x2 sashimi.   It was fresh, good tasting for being in a desert. This place is great for large groups, dinner and a show.  Would come again in a group only.",

Then shared 4 rolls (49th State Roll, tiger roll, spicy samurai roll and one other I can't remember the name). All the rolls were perfect and delicious, not fishy, tasted fresh didnt fall apart.

    "text": "*Must try (Food): Rok Shrimp Tempura (careful though there is mayonnaise in here... oops), Brussel Sprouts (perfectly crispy with honey & bacon), and Crispy Rice with spicy tuna! These are all appetizers/sides, but I recommend ordering a bunch of these to create a meal! It was the perfect mix.  We also ordered a roll, but every time I get rolls here (fresh types not the tempura types) they are so-so... Next time instead of a roll I would personally replace with an entree of fresh fish like the Citrus Miso Chilean Sea Bass. The entrees are large enough portions to share so again I recommend ordering several starters + sides with one entree (for two people)  *Must try (Drink): If you are a tequila drinker you have to try the Fire Water specialty cocktail! (Tequila, cucumber water & jalapeno) It is extremely REFRESHING and NOT SWEET :)  *Price - Definitely fairly priced for being on the strip. Yes the specialty cocktails are $15, but a glass of sparkling rose was only $12 and a glass of prosecco was $10. Rolls are $15-20 and large seafood entrees mid-$20's  *NOTE - if you are using a TRAVELZOO deal or any other coupon be sure to call ahead to verify it is not an \"event day\" They pretty much use any excuse to declare it a special event day (like last day of PBR, any arena event, hockey game, marathon etc...) and if it is one your coupon/deal will not be accepted!  *POSITIVE NOTE - It is such a fun atmosphere, lively, loud, and lots of entertainment! Great place for birthdays! If it is your birthday and there are performances going on then usually the entrainment host will come over, announce your birthday, and give you a free sake bomb!",

    "text": "Long overdue review. I've been here on three occasions and always end up having a great time.  The walls are decorated with a Japanese geisha sporting gangster sunglasses and a fan. Overall, a very cool, underground vibe.   The food is pricey, but bear in mind that you're paying for a high energy, pop-inspired singing and dancing on top of it all. The wait staff seem to enjoy their job which involves learning the choreography and dancing on top of waiter/waitress duties. You can view the entertainment all from the second level or be completely immersed in it on the first level, all while enjoying your meal.  For dishes, I recommend the Pink Pagoda Punch Bowl, the Chili Garlic Edamame, and the Honey Brick Toast. The Pink Pagoda Punch Bowl (plum sake, vodka, sparkling rose, grapefruit liqueur), is perfect to share amongst 3-4 people and does not skimp on the alcohol (I mean, every ingredient has some kind of alcohol in it) and the Honey Brick Toast is to die for. Coming from the Bay Area, it was one of best honey brick toasts I have ever had.   Sake Rok, you will always have a place in my heart. Until next time!  TLDR: If you want to have a good time with live entertainment, food, alcohol, and a cool ambiance, come here!",

Miso soup and seaweed salad is pretty hard to mess up, but theirs was just divine. I also tried their crispy sashimi tacos and shrimp ceviche tacos, which was amazing as well. My favorite small plate, however, was the pork belly. It just melted in your mouth, and was just absolute delicious. I could keep eating that all day.   From the sushi, I was able to try the Godzilla platter, salmon, king crab California, and unagi. The salmon just melted in your mouth and it was delicious! And all of the sushi on the Godzilla platter were a delight as well. My favorite out of all of them was the girl on the beach roll and the el chapo roll.   The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars (mostly because I can't give 4.5 stars) is because I like very little rice with my fish. The portion was okay, but personally, I like more fish than rice with my sushi.",

    "text": "The alchemy that is used to create the cocktails is the reason for the visit this eve. Who puts the equivalent of cayenne pepper in a mixed martini drink with Bacardi. Sake roc! It's Brilliant too!  The amazing Kenny was my bartender and his mixing skills rock. He makes a mean Dragonfly! He is the perfect bartender intelligent, good looking, and talented at pouring cocktails.   The nightly entertainment starts soon at 6 pm. Where Sake Roc is transformed into a fantastical dark fantasy of drag and thrilling costumes. The performers are dressed so stylish all in leather. The music is pulsing and with some of the best drinks in Vegas. Why are you not here?  During the day is all you can eat sushi, but not in a fishy mood. Swinging towards Vegan. Decide to enjoy the cucumber salad. It is nice and light, hydrating, and delicious. Ask for the Vegan menu; it has a wide assortment of delights on it. Next time, buffalo poppers!   The art on the walls is so beautiful here. The images portrayed on the walls are powerful, strong, and colorful. Most of the images are depictions of women. Sake-roc is presenting a powerful empowerment towards the celebration of women and all there great diversity.  Will I return here? That is not even a question; after meeting the fabulous staff of Sake I was going to stay for the \"floor show entertainment.\" They invited me to be a special guest. I had to decline since visiting XS tonight.   For the best drinks and bartenders in all of Vegas; get over here. The food is delicious, so are the staff. It is friendly for all! Their is a live DJ and if you feel like dancing just because there is a space for that here. The famous drag show is on the third floor. Check it out. The fabulous Caesar if you need any advice will listen too! Give a shout when see, poses for pictures; he's wearing long leather boots and red velvet, and great hair and makeup!",

The servers were dancing (really well) and putting on shows in between service, there was crowd participation, and GREAT music.  None of us are from here and we're already talking about coming back to this restaurant. Our chill night ended up being insanely memorable. Oh, and the food is good too????   What a gem.",

It's sitting in soy sauce, kind of unimaginable. The pork belly was well done unfortunately. Zero flavor avoid it.  The winner though? The Brussel sprouts of all things. They're delicious.   I'll say the drinks we ordered were great. The dragonfruit one and the cucumber/jalepenos was a pleasant surprise. They were tasty and well presented. Actually all food was well presented.

I didn't think I could find honey toast better than Ichiza, but this place completely hits it out of the ballpark! Perfectly sweet and melts in your mouth! The fresh fruit complements it completely!

Everything in that menu was great . I specially recommend the AYCE $35 bucks it's worth it. Reasonable for being Las Vegas. I absolutely recommend the Rok Ramen . It has great fusion of flavors.

I was unsure on what I wanted to eat and he gave me advice and it was perfect! I got the tempura roll. It was not the best sushi I've ever had but it was what I wanted!

In addition to being fresh and delicious, each dish was artistically presented with unique garnishes. The $10 glass of Sav blanc perfectly complimented the food. We weren't brave enough to order the Godzilla plate but the couple next to us did. Instant party.",

Everything I ate was so delicious. I will come back here for sure! It is pretty expensive and the portions are pretty small but it's very entertaining and beautiful inside just make sure you come with money. But it's worth the experience especially if you want to treat yourself. The music they play makes you want to dance. It's a nice date spot. You can eat good and dance by the bar. You must come here to try it out!",

They are a vibe dining restaurant and there is always something going on. From the DJ to the performances, there is never a dull moment.  Fave dishes include the shishito peppers, sweet potato appetizer and the specialty rolls.  Their new dessert (Honey Toast) is ridiculously good and perfect to share with a large groups. The service is also on point.",

First the menu thing is crazy. i want to have a conversation and discuss menu choices. too damn big IMO. I can't even remember the meal that well and the atmosphere was beyond my liking. I am not a fogey by any means but not my cup of tea. Josie was unimpressed and felt did not live up to the hype. I can see how this can be a fun place for tourists but for me not so much. They did have a good beer selection. It took us a while to get our drinks and felt like the staff more interested in each other than us. Maybe that is why food didn't stand out. When customer service is bad nothing else matters.  Thank you for coming to Sake Rok. Will not go back. Can't say it may not be for you but I was not impressed. Except for beer choices.",

The scallops were cooked perfectly and the vegetables were also prepared to perfection.   The best thing was the flavorful broth that held the veggies underneath the scallops.   I wished they had given me a spoon so that I could finish it off!  My wife had pork dumplings and a delicious roasted Brussel-sprout dish.  My daughter and her boyfriend had sushi, which looked delicious and apparently was.      In case you haven't heard, this restaurant has an informal floor show every so often, in which all the servers sing and dance.  It slows down the food delivery a bit, but it adds a fun touch to the experience.",

    "text": "My friends and I were partying all week from Thursday night to Friday day pool party, Friday nightclub, and Saturday pool party again and had catch our flight home on Saturday night.  We were exhausted but a girls gotta eat!   We decided to check out Sake Rok as our last stop before heading to the airport. I made reservations for 7PM but was running 15 minutes late but when we got there they were able to accommodate us and seat us quickly. Which I really appreciate cause I was getting kind of hangry (so hungry + I was getting angry) ... hehehe.   The energy in the room was contagious! Being in the hot sun, dancing and drinking all day  can take a lot out of you, but the food and vibe there brought us back to life! I could see my friends faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show!   I'm big on ambiance, art, architecture and decor and the place is beautifully designed! Every inch of that place looked like it was hand picked with incredible detail. To the signs, to the beautiful art on the brick walls which I was told was painted by a local graffiti artist. Even down to the napkins folded into shirts! OMG the white leather (hopefully pleather ) crocodile design  looking  seats are very cool looking and comfortable too!   Timing was impeccable, the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The salt and pepper shrimp was my favorite item on the menu, it makes me salivate just thinking about it, simple but oh so good! I love rolls and we got the El Chapo and The girl on the beach did not disappoint! We also got the ceviche, which was way better than I expected because I always think ceviche is hit or miss but it was really good, and came with these yummy chips. The Mochi was really good, I suspect Bubbies (from Hawaii my favorite!) Mochi which are the best around, unless they made them in house the chocolate, had crunchy chocolate chips inside. I consider myself a bit of a Mochi conoisoire.   We didn't get the Godzilla platter but I saw several tables getting it and it looked really cool! The presentation was dope, did my eyes deceive me or was there smoke coming out of the Godzilla as it was served to the table?  Service was on point too! My water was always filled, which was great because well partying in the Vegas desert can dehydrate you. Empty dishes were promptly taken away. Our server Vince was excellent, and we were able to get out of their quickly because we had a flight to catch!   I will definitely make Sake Rok a stop every time I visit Vegas!",

It's delicious and is the perfect way to end your meal at Sake Rok. And if you are with a group of people, the Godzilla platter is the way to go.

The only downside I have was when we ordered my group of 3 decided to go with one of the \"deals\" located on the large menus. You can choose from two appetizers, entrees, dessert etc for $55, $70 depending on whatever deal you chose. We picked the $55 deal which came with more than enough delicious and well prepared food for the 3 of us, however, unbeknownst to us was that the deal was per person instead of collectively as a group which was not listed.

Next, we ordered some sashimi pieces and two rolls: the Rok & Roll and Puff the Magic Dragon. Rok & Roll is a riceless roll, wrapped in cucumber. It's the restaurant's speciality roll. Honestly wasn't that special. Maybe if you like crab in your rolls you'll like it, but it really wasn't that great. Puff was a little better. I subbed out the crab after tasting it in the other roll and got salmon instead. Tasted much better. The sashimi was pretty good (1 order = 1 piece) but the yellowtail didn't taste as buttery as it should.",

Our specialty rolls were expertly crafted with the freshest ingredients and tasted heavenly. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp was so good we were about to pay the bill and leave but simply had to order another round yum! The food was top notch all the way but what sets Sake Rok apart is the high level entertainment and kindness of the staff. The servers are also incredible dancers and bust into routines periodically for guests viewing pleasure! It was my Step-dad's 60th Bday and Sake Rok made it sooo special. They brought him up on stage, sat him in a big chair, and had beautiful woman dance all around him. After that they hooked him up with a ninja headband which he proudly boasted the duration of our Vegas Trip and referred to himself as the Sake bomb ninja king lol. During our night at Sake Rok the Owner, GM, and Host made the effort to engage with our table which left us all glowing! Thank you for such a memorable experience we will be back!",

We wanted sushi and this was one of the closest.  We scored...  Our best dining experience of the weekend.  Fun, casual, interesting,  and oh so tasty!  The menu is literally HUGE,  but don't let that fool you on the quality of the sushi. Drinks were great as well, the table favorite was like a spicy margarita, but with a Japanese flare.  Great Rock music the whole time, some 80s reminiscent dance and music videos on the wall.  It was a great way to cap off another fun weekend in Vegas.",

The food is fabulous, and Jonnis & company keep you entertained from the moment you walk in the door and make you sorry that you have to leave when it's time to go home.  It's like a party you don't want to end.  I first stumbled across the restaurant when in town for a concert at T-Mobile and wanted to get a quick bite before the show. I almost wanted to skip the concert and stay at Sake Rok. A month later we were back in town and had to share this place with the people we were traveling with. I've told everyone I know that this is a must do when in town!!  The sushi was prepared perfectly and presented with flair. Edamame was hot, just salty enough and served immediately. The staff is professional, fun and talented.  Great location in The Park and a wonderful new vibe for Vegas. My only complaint is they aren't open late night as this would be a place where you could hang out with friends long past 10pm.  Thanks for making Vegas fun again!!",

I remember at one point our waitress said she would come take our order after she performed. Five seconds later she was being held up doing splits in mid-air.   It was a great place to kick off the night, and the $50 fish bowls might be on the pricier side but they were really good and had a strong kick to them.

There menu was pretty impressive.  They have this Godzilla thing I forgot the name of it but it was pretty cool.  Too bad I wasn't that hungry.  I opted for the 12 piece sashimi, chef's choice.    Its not the best sushi I've ever had but its definitely pretty good still.  The fish was fresh but not extremely fresh.  I think with the heat of the summer its kinda hard for that to be possible but it was still as fresh as can be.  It didn't have any smelly fish scent so that's always good.  The taste was on point.  I finished my plate in no time and was left pretty satisfied.  My friend was also left pretty satisfied.  The wasabi had a huge kick to it though.  We made the mistake of using too much lol.  The decor is very modern and nice.  The open so you don't really feel cramped.  The tables are a bit small but they worked fine.  The service was on point.  Everyone had their A game on that day.  That's what catapulted this review up an extra star in my books.  Excellent service and the chefs were all really cool and awesome too.  My only regret was that I didn't sit at the sushi bar.  Next time....next time.  Overall I really like this place.  Its a nice joint to grab some Japanese food and some delicious sushi when in Vegas.  Located near the Shake Shack and New York New York its a nice spot to come hang and enjoy some quality food.",

We initially were going to choose a different restaurant but really liked the look of this restaurant from the outside and decided to go in. We are so happy we did! It is hip and fun, with a really cool ambience, great music, and excellent service. We ordered a Ramen soup, shishito peppers, and vegetable tempura for appetizers. For main entrees, my friend ordered the salmon which was incredible and I ordered a yellowtail with scallion roll and a Toro with scallion roll. We ordered a small bottle of bunny sake white peach flavor which was phenomenal. All of the food was delicious. It was perfection. The prices are more than reasonable and everything about this place is awesome. We are so coming back as locals and we know great restaurants in this town, so Sake Rok is definitely part of the great restaurants in Las Vegas.",

My favorite part was definitely the boyband battle (and I will keep the details as a secret). It was fun and very entertaining!   As for the food, it went on the pricey side in terms of the portion. Delicious, but pricey. If you are looking for a solo food experience, it's not the place to go. However, my friends and I all agreed it balanced out when it was actually food + show combo.

The prices for their food is a bit on the pricier side, however everything that we ate was awesome. My wife and I shared the pork belly, steak and scallops. Out of those three items, the scallops were the best. It came with 5 nice portioned scallops in a delicious butter sauce.   However, that made this restaurant stand out was the entertainment that came with the dinner. There was live dancing and crowd participation. If you want a dinner and a show and a place to have fun, then this Is the spot. We definitely want to try this place again the next time we are in Vegas.",

The decor and lay out is attractive, but the flavors of the food was lacking. There were only probably 5 other customers while we were there and it still took about 20 minutes to receive our food after we had ordered.  Rok Ceviche - Average. Just small fresh cuts of sashimi plated fancy. Add some shoyu and plate it differently and you can call it a mixed poke appetizer.  Rok & Roll - Presentation was really nice, but the roll tasted bland. The yuzu soy foam was a nice touch, but I wish it was ontop of the roll rather than in the middle of the dish.  Spicy Samurai - Not spicy. Looks prettier than it tastes because of the chili threads. Same bland taste as the rok & roll.   Add two beers with this order and $100 later, we were on our way. I'm sure the night time vibe is completely different",

    "text": "\"When I say sake rok, you say sake bomb!!!!\"   Great for parties, bachelor/bachelorette, team outings etc. Boyfriend and I were here on a Sunday evening around 6:40pm and it was already alive and jamming. Got the emcee startin it off....hypin up the crowds...dancers all around the dining floor, up on the bar tables....definitely entertaining.  We ordered the following items: -shishito peppers -baked crab hand rolls (two hand rolls per order) - baked snow crab, spicy aioli, avocado in soy paper. -tiger roll - shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, spicy tuna, negi, spicy dynamite sauce -kamikaze roll - shrimp tempura, jalapeno, avocado, tuna, jalapeno vinaigrette, eel sauce, lime juice, micro cilantro  This may not seem a lot of food, but it was enough to fill us up. Plus these rolls can start off at $16.00....it can add up...QUICK. The baked crab hand roll was $20.00 and it only came with TWO PIECES. Yikes. For $20, you would think you get more than that. So don't come here if you're on a budget....or if you're starving or else your bill would be like $70.00 PER PERSON. They can charge this much for sushi because A.) they're located on Las Vegas Blvd and B.) the ambiance + entertainment is different than your usual sushi restaurants.   It's fun to check out...but you come here for the experience and entertainment. If you want just a good old normal sushi restaurant without the sticker shock, this won't be for you.",

Their menu is pretty small compared to other sushi places I've been to, but the quality of food is superb!!!! We ate family style and ordered Spicy Edamame, Salmon and avocado roll, Shogun roll, Tiger roll, and Girl on the beach. Everything was delicious!!!!!!!   Throughout dinner they had a DJ playing the best songs that make you want to get up and dance, which some people did. They also had a MC who goes around to the tables and interacts with customers. Tip: order sake bombs!!!!!!  We came on a Friday night at 9:15p and we were sat immediately. If you're looking for a fun place to eat to either get your party started or continue with the Vegas feel then this place is a must!!!",

    "text": "As a Vegas local I made the mistake of coming here without doing any research on this place. We needed something convenient near T-Mobile since we had a concert in a couple of hours. It's a Friday night and figured sushi seemed like a simple fix for a well deserved date night. Well...we were told they had seats by the sushi bar then get seated and get sent back because they realized the area wasn't bussed. 5 minutes later get seated at a table, 10 minutes go by and no acknowledgement, then a performance begins, maybe 5-10 min which felt awkward, unless the servers dancing for you is your thing. We finally get a drink order and the menu is more on the pricey side, but then I realized I'm paying for location, and the dancing act. For the price you would expect exquisite taste and quality, but it tasted subpar. The portions are small for the price you're paying. $15 for 5 pieces of shrimp tempura that wasn't anything special. We had 3 items to share which totaled $65 and worst part is we're still hungry.   Service was slow, even when it started to slow down. Server took awhile to return my credit card and busser returned it to me because the server thought she returned it. We left hungry for our concert at T Mobile.  We ended up getting In N Out burger afterwards lol.",

It was spendy and not sure if it would be worth the price anywhere else. All restaurants on the strip overprice their food sometimes even with subpar food.  Service was great but then again, we came in after the lunch rush and no one was there except us. Might have been the first negative sign? We ate anyways. Our server was great and of course he recommended everything on the menu and nothing could go wrong.... not ever sure how biased those answers are.  Food was decent. The portion size small but it filled us plenty. The seaweed salad was honestly the best part. Good unique flavor without being overly salty. The gyoza was okay, well cooked, plenty to go around as it came with the ramen and the bento boxes. Bento boxes did offer a good variety of bites if you are looking for multiple flavors. I personally got the ramen and it tasted like instant ramen with added flair like pork belly, nori, etc. otherwise no special standouts but not bad either.  For the price, might be back if they improved their lunch/dinner specials. Otherwise just another standard Asian restaurant on the strip.  The actual venue was super clean and open. Loved the decor.  Will be back only if starving. Will continue to explore the strip in the future. Happy eating.",

We had the garlic lime endamne it was the best I have had. Then we had the crunchy Brussels sprouts, girl on the beach, el chapo, and tiger sushi rolls. My favorite was the girl on the beach but all the rolls were delicious.  Let's talk about the entertainment! At various times the wait staff would break out dances moves to popular early 2000 songs. It was amazing you wanted to get up and dance with them. The female DJ kept the mood and energy up as well. I will definitely be going back with a bigger group of friends and turn it out....lol",

We stumbled by the spot after looking at 4 other places before the Bruno Mars concert. I was so happy that we were sooo indecisive because once we walked in the door, we knew this was it! They had a dj, live entertainment and the food was great! Definitely will be returning and if your looking to have a birthday dinner, this is the place to have it!",

    "text": "A fun and delicious time! My boyfriend and I came here for a late V-Day/before a show dinner. The location is great, right between NYNY and Park MGM in a little walkway of restaurants right before you get to the T-Mobile Arena. We decided to park at NYNY but either hotel parking garage would probably be just as close.   It's definitely not your traditional sushi joint. It's loud (very loud) and kind of crazy, but in a fun way. During our visit there was a performer walking around the room making fun of tables and encouraging sake bombs. He looked like a funner version of Adam Lambert and I honestly felt like he was my spirit animal that night. Besides him, there also was a few breakout dance sessions featuring some of the waiters. Dinner and a show for sure.   The food was pretty good too. We shared the shoshito peppers to start. They were very flavorful and a HUGE portion. We also had the tuna tataki. It was fresh and the slices were pretty thick. For sushi we shared the El Chapo Roll and Girl on the Beach. Personally I liked the Girl on the Beach better, but both were good. The sizing of the rolls was pretty on par with other restaurants I've been to as well.   I obviously saved the best for last and I'm talking about the punch bowl. A $60 wooden block full of delicious alcohol. We shared the Tekira Monster. The flavor was very good, you could barely taste the booze. We still felt it though, by the end of the meal I had a nice buzz going. Overall it was a good time and I'd come back again.",

He was well prepared for the class and provided a lot of insightful information on sushi making. Some of his tips I use at home today when making rice.   The rice was cooled in front of us. Then it was seasoned with special ingredients for flavor. This sushi rice was the best rice I have ever had. I am planning to go back for just the rice lol! The fish was fresh and high quality. The avacado was also fresh and not turning brown. I must say I don't eat fish so for most of my rolls I skipped the fish selection. I tried the fresh salmon which was superb.   In the end we each made several rolls that we consumed. I made so many I couldn't finish them and had to get a to go container.   This class would be okay for vegans and vegetarians if they want to skip the fish. There's other veggies you can put in your rolls.",

The restroom has an attendant so you know it's a classy establishment ;)  The host was hysterical and made sure he approached each table for some extra shenanigans.

We came in by looking up yelp for a quick but decent bite of sushi.   Food:  - Volcano Roll tastes good, but comes with only 5 pieces at $18 - Rok Ramen is sub-par: definitely not homemade, both the noodles and the broth were less than satisfactory at $18 - Asparagus side was $9 for 6 pieces   Live music and dance was something unexpected and pretty fun to watch. But if you are not in it for the music, you could probably get much more affordable Japanese food for half the price tag.",

Good fun to overhear and catch games on TV screens playing thoughout. Had a beer (limited selection); a bunny bomb (don't sit at bar if you want to properly drink bomb with fanfare and all bc bar too sturdy to shake);House specialty roll (forgot name-my fave); Tiger roll, Salmon Avocado (tiny and a dud);Tempura roll with the bill coming out to $99. Wanted sashimi but at $5 a piece, I was priced out. Husband not impressed with sake pricewise and taste. Hey, but had to try.",

Everyone was friendly and helpful. A great place for a birthday party, bachelorette or bachelor party dinner, or even unique date night. I went for a girl's night out and it was a fabulous time!   We started out with their drink menu. The cocktails are to die for! My favorites would be the Hunny Bunny (tastes like Cinnamon Toast Crunch) & the Dragonfly (I think it tastes like Mexican candy, sweet with the perfect amount of spicy). You have to try them! My friend and I tried about 6 (total, I'm not a complete lush) of the drinks and we would order all of again. Bartender Virginia was very attentive and personable. Great at making drinks and knowledgable about the menu. Angel was also a great help when Virginia took a quick break.   Now for the food..WOW! You know it's going to be good when they have double sided chop sticks!Everything's we ordered (about 11 different items, we were hungry and wanted to try as much as possible) was delicious.  My favorite item was the hamachi Serrano, raw yellowtail with some type of magical sauce topped with a Serrano pepper. Seriously so good, my friend and I rock, paper, scissored it for the last piece. I would come back for just this dish. Definitely need to get this if you enjoy fish. The edamame was garlicky and so so good. Dumplings were great. I'm not sure what rolls we ordered but we ate it all! Can't wait to go back again!",

The atmosphere is fun, very loud so don't plan on being able to hold a conversation (I love the vibe if the music could be turned down a slight notch) and if you are shy, beware they pull people from the crowd to interact during their dance/singing routines.   We had reservations at 8pm and were seated right away but ignored, literally with no one even bothering to say two words to us even though we were passed by multiple people multiple times due to setting up other tables for large parties. If we had to wait, even though there were empty tables, I would have rather waited in the lobby than be ignored and passed by over and over and over without one word.   I finally ordered a drink that took 10 more minutes to arrive and when it did, it was a substitute since the restaurant was out of the ingredients of the cocktail I had originally ordered. Luckily, I was flexible since I just wanted anything to dull the experience thus far.   Food came sporadically but was overall good. Pork belly was overlooked.   I work for MGM Resorts and definitely take customer service seriously, it is the hallmark of our industry. I doubt I'll be back and if I do make it back, it will be months to see if the rookie mistakes have a chance to be corrected.",

My friend and I went to the bar and got some drinks, and expected the hostess to come get us when our table was ready. A minute after our reservation time, we walked back to the hostess and she asked us \"How can I help you?\" It seemed like she had already forgotten our faces in such a short time?  We were taken to our table on the second floor where a waitress was setting our table. She introduced herself as our waitress, and we sat down. We weren't given menus, and waited about ten minutes before we asked a random waiter passing by for a menu. He brought one to us, and we proceeded to wait even longer. I'm not sure how long we waited, but our waitress had not passed by again. We had to ask a random waiter if we would be able to order.   A waiter came by and apologized that there had been a mix up in the tables, and he took our order. (Confusing because our previous waitress had already introduced herself?). We ordered, and about five minutes later our original waitress came by apologizing, saying that she put in our order. Cool!  After waiting quite a while, eventually one sushi roll came out. My friend and I began to eat, when the waiter came by and apologized that our other sushi roll was taking a while. He offered free sake bombs to compensate for our trouble. Cool!  We took the free drink, and eventually our other roll came. The food was good, but a bit pricey. Food was a 4, service was a 2, average review is about a 3. The entertainment was interesting, lots of dancing!",

    "text": "Big fan of this place. Came here on 4/2 for a sneak preview. The staff and service are excellent. Perfect spot for cocktails and sushi and a welcome escape from the strip chaos. The menu is uncomplicated with a focus on select ingredients and everything from light cucumber rolls to more adventurous fried chicken roll. Very inventive! We tried the edamame with lemon and garlic (must have!), the shishito peppers (very good!) and probably every roll on the menu. I am allergic to all shellfish and Albert was the most accommodating host and went out of his way to recommend allergen friendly rolls as well as customize a few of the spicy tuna ones to exclude crab et al. Thank you Sake Rok!",

They also performed a few amazingly choreographed dances and brought members of the 'audience' up on stage to dance with them!  It was a great atmosphere and tons of fun, and you could tell the staff were excited to be and work there.  Be forewarned that this place is fairly expensive, especially for the portions of food that you get ($11 for a veggie tempura that consisted of 2 stalks of asparagus, one piece of eggplant, and an onion), but I kind of wrote it off as an entertainment tax since we got to watch the servers perform and dance.",

The sushi. was. amazing over there. Same prices too. Skip this place if you don't relish feeling invisible or giving your money to an establishment who doesn't care about their guests.",

I came in around 530PM and was greeted by a nice hostess that sat me write in the action of this place.   I sat down right before they started one of their shows which seemed to be a \"boy-band battle\" The energy in the room was contagious! I could see everyone's faces light up as we were entertained by the music from the live DJ and then the show!  I have been to quite a few restaurants in Las Vegas but haven't seen a venue that is this unique. It feels like it belongs in Tokyo, San Francisco or New York. There was cool street art all over the place and there was a giant video wall that went with the shows. Little details everywhere that you typically don't see anymore  I am a sushi snob and can be hard to please at times, but the food came out fast and was delicious! You could taste the quality in each item! The Omakase Platter was my favorite item on the menu. I also ordered the El Chapo roll and loved the tomatillo sauce! We decided to get the Tomahawk Steak as well and with the Truffle butter on top it was simply amazing. They brought it out on this cool Godzilla platter that came with a cool presentation. To finish dinner we ordered the Honey Toast, and it was LIFE CHANGING!  Service was great and my server kept up with my drinks. They had great recommendations and really created an amazing experience. Excited to visit again on my next workshop trip to Vegas!!!",

From the dancing geisha to the DJ and the dancing servers, they certainly made this a special event for my birthday night!   I will say the menu is a bit exotic and takes a minute to figure out before ordering. Pretty pricy, but to be expected for the strip.

It was my first time coming here and I will be sure to come back. It's just sad I have been in Vegas first 11 days and this was my first time coming here. I would have come back multiple times during my stay.  My only complaints is they only have low sodium soy sauce. They also messed up our order so 5 tables who where sat after us were served. This would have been fine if that was said in the first place rather then the food coming out and being told then. Other than that....this place was great.

Loud and upbeat place so don't expect a quite dining experience. They do short singing and dancing shows intermittently that is quite entertaining. Jonnice can lively up the dining area with little effort. If you just want to grab a few drinks or cocktails and enjoy an upbeat experience, then visit Sake Rok.",

I gave a 3 star because the service was pretty slow, considering we came in around 5:00 pm and there were only a few tables:  1). First off, It took a while for our hot tea and water to get there until we reminded them (apparently there were chatting among themselves near the bar). 2). We were given our check when we haven't even asked for it and while we were still waiting for our Black Cod dish to arrive. We told him the order was in the bill but hasn't come out yet. he did say sorry but wasn't very attentive all in all.  Other than that, their food was pretty good and fresh. We had a light meal and what's worth mentioning was uni sashimi (considering the price they charge), and Miso Black Cod dish was excellent. We also ordered Wagyu but I've had better.",

I used to be a mixologist in San Francisco and the cook tails are really decent for the presentation is really fun.  But the best part is the services and the drag emcee is amazing and the servers are all fantastic performers that work here on the side.  They regularly break out into song and fierce dance moves. Amy our server is a real pro with some stellar moves.  Caesar gave us great food suggestion. We had the honey toast for dessert...super yummy. Sometimes it's a little slow but it's still a blast.

If you'd been to good Japanese restaurants, you will not be pleased with Sake Rok, overpriced, quality of sushi rice is not good. For pork dumplings they charge $10 and they came out warm and were super tiny, looks like the frozen pork dumplings you in bags. Please if your going to spend $25+ go to a buffet better. Miso soup is packets one and is watered down with only 3 pieces of real tofu. The only good thing is the service there is awesome and the mochi ice cream. That's all.",

We had sushi salmon and varies rolls however what really got me gob smacked was the chicken. The chicken bokchoy literally was the most perfectly moist dish I've ever had with a crunchy outside, it just fell apart on my fork supplemented by a deep fired bokchoy they complimented each other just right.",

I am actually a local and we were doing a staycation on the strip with a friend that was visiting me from out of town. We were craving sushi so we decided to check this place out in \"The Park\" (next to Monte Carlo). I must say that I had a fantastic time!!  They played music from when I was in high school, from Backstreet boys, N Sync, Madonna etc .. and the servers were performing and singing along with them as well! The rolls were expensive but very good. You get what you paid for right? The found out it was my birthday they got me a Sake Bomber and sang Happy Birthday. This is a very loud place and it is not recommended to bring children. The workers said after a certain time they have a show that may be inappropriate for children, but we did not hear anything out of the ordinary. If you are on the strip, craving for sushi, listen to some old school and to have a good time, this is a good spot to go to !!  As far as rolls, we got the tempura, tiger, volcano, el chapo roll. My favorite was the tempura roll! The edemame took a while to bring b/c they were cooking it and that was also good as well!!",

With only four tables occupied during lunch I fear to see how bad this place operates when they're busy. There are definitely many other places better than Ness that are all you can eat.",

    "text": "I had no idea what I was getting into when we made reservations at Sake Rok. Reservations on a weekend are likely a good idea, as we arrived for dinner there were many patrons waiting outside in the 100+ heat waiting for a table.   Everything looked normal at first, but within minutes the lights went out, loud music blasted, and staff came running out in wigs and glasses and began dancing on the bar and around the restaurant. This was a pleasant, fun surprise for us, as we were out for a bachelorette celebration, but those with their family trying to have a nice, quiet sushi meal should look elsewhere. The host was a complete crack up. He had wild and crazy makeup, luscious, long, curls (way to go if that is your natural hair) and very flamboyant outfits that he changed regularly throughout our meal. He did an excellent job of keeping the restaurant alive and engaged.    Our table ordered the sake bomb special, which was $80 and included a very small pony keg of beer and two porcelain tokkuri of sake. This was enough for about 14 sake bombs, which made them about $5.70 each. The host came over and did one with us, while announcing the entire process to the restaurant over the microphone.   The sushi was expensive, but I'll admit that's because I come from the land of affordable \"all you can eat\" sushi in Northern Nevada. Each roll was $20, plus or minus a few dollars. Side items like edamame, miso, etc., were $6 each. This ended up being a very expensive outing for our group of 8, but the atmosphere was really fun and lively, and the food was fine.   Certainly not the best sushi I've ever had, but if I found myself back in Vegas with friends looking for a fun meal, I'd return.",

They dance and sing randomly ... making a fun experience.     The only down side is the food here is expensive.  But given that your in Vegas it's expected.  The only reason for 4 stars is when I was here, I came with a party of 6.  We all paid of bill in full using credit cards/cash.  We had enough to cover the bill and give a pretty big tip. The waiter ran after us after we left thinking we shorted them $5 bucks.  We explained how the bill was broken down and the waiter to seem to understand.  2 mins later...he's running after us again saying it's still off.  (Already running late for a show we gave him $5 bucks not to argue).  Not a big deal...but just annoying considering we left a pretty big tip and had to give another $5.",

I can't say enough about the sushi and how fresh it is - the best I have ever had. The service is amazing and not one server walks by your table without filling water or checking on you. The whole environment is so much fun and you definitely leave looking forward to the next time you can return. A sure place to go with a group and you are definitely going to have a good time but we have went with just two of us and it was still a great time. Every app we have had as well as the hanger steak have been fantastic. Look forward to going back and a great place to go before or after an event at the TMobile arena.",

    "text": "So this place was actually a Yelp recommendation. We were in Vegas to celebrate my best friend's 30th birthday and the group wanted sushi. So away we went!   We were planning on going dancing after dinner so we we were all dressed up. We were seated promptly and greeted with a smile and waters all around (a big plus in Vegas when your blood runs thick with alcohol most of the time.) The menus are incredibly easy to read, as they were nearly 2 feet tall.  The ambience was FUN! There is DJ spinning all kinds of music and about every 15 minutes or so, the place bursts with live entertainment including dancing waiters, a vibrant emcee and projectors/tv on blast. We witnessed a 90s boy band sing off, an 80s hair band air guitar contest and I was even chosen to salsa with the emcee. It's definitely loud in there but you have to expect that when the music is that good. :)  The food... oh the food. I am a self proclaimed foodie and the one thing I can tell you is get the Japanese Wagyu Sliders. If the restaurant is reading this, NEVER TAKE THEM OFF THE MENU! They were cooked perfectly, topped with foie gras and garnished with a shishito pepper. My only regret was dropping one on the floor while trying to pass the dish down the table. What a waste! The manager on duty, however, replaced it on the house which not only made my day, but made me order one more set of sliders as well. Bravo sir and thank you.  If you ever find yourself in Vegas (and you will) don't miss this place. It's a diamond in the rough, a real find and a Park Ave treasure. Cheers!",

Make sure your phone is fully charged because there is so much going on and beautiful artwork around the venue that you're going to want to capture every moment!

I didn't have a chance to look at the menu as everything sent out was being chosen by the chef, however everything we had was phenomenal.  The mushroom Toban-yaki was one of the most amazing things I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. The New York steak was beautifully seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Hamachi tacos were excellent.  We had about 7 or 8 dishes and everything was amazing, including the seasoning on the edamame which escalated it to a new level.    Sake Rok is not all about the food though, it's entertainment and ambiance add to the overall experience.  This is the perfect restaurant for a first date or a light entertaining meal before a show at T-Mobile.  The staff is really helpful at explaining the food and when it comes time for a \"quick-show\", your server suddenly becomes a dancer/entertainer   If you love sushi and Japanese food, Sake Rok is a must try!",

    "text": "Had great expectations for this place. An all you can eat menu for $25!! Wow!! However, there's fine print. We didn't see that until after we sat down. We came in after 1pm on a Saturday. The place was virtually empty except for 4, maybe 5 tables. We were asked to wait another 15 minutes so they could set up our table and also because the host didn't want to overwhelm the one and only waitress working. Ok. We get it. No problem. Had a beer at the outside bar. When we finally got seated and looked over the menu, all you can eat menu only covers the appetizers, $5 basic sushi-1 piece only and the basic hand/cut rolls (no specialty rolls). When you order, you can only order 3 items at a time. Not sure if they were having a big party that evening but our first orders didn't come out of the kitchen for 20 min!! How long does it take to prepare 5 appetizers and 2 pieces of sushi (times 6 people)?? We asked to put in our next order since the wait was long and were told by our waitress that we must finish eating our first round of food before we can order again. Granted the fine print also says there is a 1 hour time limit.  As frustrating as this was, everyone was very nice. Food was delivered with a smile and the food tasted great.  Still cant understand why the food took so long to come out. Even waited 15 minutes for mochi.  The whole time we were in the restaurant (about 90 min) there were no more than 3 or 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  Wont be back again, even though the food was great.",

Service overall was not constant, other than the water boy who kept us hydrated (appreciate that in Vegas!)  The sushi was good, and drinks were great. We even did sake bombs at the end, which was fun with the way they do it.  I would definitely come to this place again!",

It was pretty good, but that's only because I've been to some really great Omakase restaurants (one where all the fish is flown from Japan and was prepared in front of you - OMAKASE in SF).   The ambience seemed fun. Expect dinner and a show, which means that it's kind of loud. They also pull people from the crowd, which was fun. The waiters and waitresses are the performers. However, this makes getting help hard when the show is happening.",

We booked the space for the night and the team provided enough sake bombs, drinks, entertainment, and music for 4 hours despite the very limited seating and small dance floor.  The sushi was solid but I would recommend sticking with that - the other fare was pretty meh.  Also, the vegetarian options are basically limited to a vegetarian roll and some pretty bland \"roasted vegetable skewers.\"  I would just call ahead and ask that they prepare a vegetarian option ahead of time.  Other than that, the Kamikaze roll, volcano roll, mochi ice cream, ceviche, salmon avocado, and spicy tuna rolls were very good.",

Part Culinary: Chef Bobby Silva showcases his unique culinary skills with a menu of Japanese popular dishes with a unique twist of fusion. The menu varies with shared plates of Crispy Sashimi Tacos to irresistible entrees such as their Pan-Seared Scallops. They have unique offerings of sushi rolls: Puff the Magic Dragon Roll with snow crab, avocado, eel, eel sauce, and fresh cucumber. Be sure to ask your friendly server about their one-of-a-kind Godzilla Platter!  As for alcoholic drinks, their highlights include their specialty cocktails such as Whiskey On The Rok which is their \"signature five spice infused old fashioned featuring Old Forester Bourbon.\" Be adventurous and order their signature Sake Bombs!   They may be known for their fresh sushi and house sake, but they also have tender and flavorful steak. My personal favorite: Their enticing 42 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Steak with foie gras and rich butter.   For dessert, I highly recommend their Honey Toast, it is undeniably mouthwatering! They say that the portion is large enough to share with several, but you would NOT want to share it after one savory bite.   Part Performance: Sake Rok transforms into an alluring spectacle: their multi-talented servers are also your entertainers!  The interactive entertainers invite you, their guests, to be part of the vivacious spectacle.   This is not just a place to dine or to spectate --- it is a place that encourages all of us to let loose and release our inhibitions. Come ready to immerse yourself to an unexpected and unforgettable experience!",

The way they have you enjoy the saki bombs is unique and fun.  At one point the MC came and offered us  saki bombs on him. It was great-yes the restaurant has a MC.  What was also great was the show- the staff, the waiters, waitresses, sushi chef, and MC, put on an amazing choreograph performance for guest of several songs  By fave artistes of all time-our performance was Backstreet Boys favs-loved it!!!

The sushi was really rough though and the miso soup was 99$ salt, 1% water/ tofu/seaweed. The tempura shrimp appetizer was okay but did not save the meal whatsoever. The sushi was just not great. The service was also very slow. Some tables came and went before I received my soup. The only star was for the waiter - although he was very slow, he was really nice. ***I would not recommend to a friend***",

Salmon is fresh and taste good. Some sashimi pieces are cooked, when they should be raw the mackerel for example. The cocktails are good, stong but with mixed perfectly,  their isn't a fight between alcohol and mixes; Sakura and Asking for Trouble.   The servers are good never pushed us get everything on the menu and always came by to make sure we were satisfied. The same can't be said about the host.  When we ate there the place was empty, too late for lunch to early for dinner, yet she wanted to put us right by a column. We weren't having it and she rolled her eyes and put us somewhere else. The host is everybody's first dinning experience especially if your 1st time.  The decor of the place was awesome, loved the painting on the wall, actually the wall.  Great graffiti work.",

DJ was our server. Granted we had a party of 16. 6 of us were going to share a check. It took OVER 30 minutes to get there 8 sake person special. OVER 30 minutes to get second order or fries. We also did a first round of sake first which was HOT and then our second round was COLD. He NEVER apologize or owned up for the wait more his lack to remember we had hot sake. AGAIN the WORST service I had EVER had and I would never come back for that reason NOR recommended this to ANYONe bc the entertainment could not out way  the HORRIBLE service.",

This is not a place that you would want to go to have a quiet dinner, because it is so interactive and so wonderfully fun. The food is incredible- top grade sushi with amazing flavor. You MUST try the coconut rice. It's a game changer. The sushi was delectable as were the spicy edamame and brussel sprouts. We were not crazy about their version of the seaweed salad but it was fine. The desert- described as a fortress of goodness- was full of honey and sweet bread and fresh fruit. Don't miss that! Say hello to Maria in the washroom, she is a gem. The dining experience was so personal and purposeful. The owners were genuinely kind and I think we met every employee, which was a treat. I don't want to give too much away but definitely go and enjoy your time at this gem of a place on the Vegas strip. You won't regret it. Possibly my new favorite place in the country but definitely in Vegas!! A+++",

At first the honey toast looked fine,  then they insisted on cutting the four corners and making it looked like someone stepped on the dish! The show is very short and silly.

Here on a tuesday, the place is basically empty at dinner time other than a couple families with small children (typical sight on the Vegas Strip these days). So I asked the hostess to seat me at the sushi bar. They seat me at the bar and within minutes after being served, I have 3 guys with clown wigs dancing on the bar as I am trying to eat. And the place is dead. I was 1 of maybey 9 people in the entire restaurant. Very awkward. The fish was tasty though (had 4 types of nigiri) ALL the sushi is a la cart, so it is very difficult and expensive toneat here solo. There is no \"sushi variety plate\" for solo diners which is unfortunate. To summarize, on a weekend night with a large group this place could be fun. If youre out on the strip looking to EAT sushi, I would avoid Sake Rok",

We came in, got seated and were given water. After about 10 minutes, no one came to take our order. To add insult to injury, the host asked us if he can borrow our chair to take a picture with the table of guys next to us. I normally won't mind that, but even after that and seeing that we still have our menus in front of us and having no food on our table, we still did not get any server to take our order!!!

Located in  Las Vegas just a tad down the side street on the North Side of New York New York - located in the new \"Park.\"  Excellent sushi in many varieties - it just melts in your mouth. Delectable!!!  Also one of the best martinis I've had in town and possibly for years. We had salmon sushi and rolls, along with pork dumplings. Then we just kept going from there.  They let you order a bit at a time and keep going as you wish.  Don't miss the unbelievable new addition to Vegas.  You will be glad you came!!!",

Definitely the best honey toast in Vegas I must say!! Better than Ichiza! The honey toast had fresh fruit and was drenched with honey butter and ice cream with a hint of cinnamon on it!

    "text": "I'll start by saying that CAESAR, the chefs & the performers deserve 6 stars. They were great!  However, the whole dinner experience was one of the worst that my boyfriend and I have had. We bought a \"dinner & a show\" package for Valentine's day so our dinner was prepaid. We showed up at 7pm and our show was at 9:30pm. A couple minutes after being seated, Caesar came over and offered us some water and told us who our server would be (can't remember her name but I'm assuming she's new). Maybe 5 minutes later our server came over to take our drink and food orders. The table across from us got their drinks and food before we even got our drinks and we got there before them. It took 15 minutes just to get one of our drinks and it was only because we told Caesar we didn't get it yet. 20 minutes later Caesar saw that we didn't have our food so he went to check and the waitress didn't even put our order in. Finally, our food came out and we were happy that Caesar was checking in on us. Half way through our meal they brought my boyfriend another drink that we didn't ask for.  When we asked Caesar for a box he told our original waitress to get us a box, which took her 5 minutes. We then had to ask for our bill and 10 minutes later (8:50pm) she comes back and says she has to get a manager to check our prepaid receipt. 5 minutes later the manager comes down, looks at the receipt then says \"so what's the question?\" When I told him that we were just waiting for our final bill he seemed confused as to why the waitress even called him over. We left at 9:15 to go to our show. Our finally bill charged us for two of my boyfriends drinks even though we only ordered one. We would have corrected them but didn't want to wait another 20 mins for our waitress to figure out what she was doing.   Long story short, that waitress either needs better training or shouldn't be a waitress if she can't handle more than one table at a time.   I recommend this place for the atmosphere, the entertainment, & the food. Definitely ask for Caesar's table.",

I've never been to a sushi restaurant where nigiri sushi was just one piece, so I ordered some thinking I was getting two for $5-$10 but instead it was literally just one tiny slice of fish for that price. I also ordered the sashimi tacos which turned out to be bite sized. Overall, the food was delicious, the portions just didn't equate to the price.",

    "text": "This place is just AWESOME!!!   During VMworld my buddy and I actually stumbled into this place on our last day in Las Vegas. We were on our way to Bellagio for the buffet when we saw signs pointing to Sake Rok right outside New York New York. From the outside looking in we thought it was one of those trendy Japanese Asian fusion restaurants catering to the younger crowd with their westernized tastes buds. Were we ever so wrong!  We walked in and the place was virtually empty. Since it was so hot we decided to grab a beer at the sushi bar before continuing on to Bellagio. That's when something caught our eye - on each table there was a tall, silver, cylindrical centerpiece that looked like a miniature soda tank. Our waitress Jen explained that it was actually a custom made mini keg that held 80oz of beer! We just had to order one. Since we were hungry we decided to order a couple of nigiri sushi appetizers to hold us over until dinner. That was probably the best sushi we've ever had this side of Tokyo! We started off with the Uni with quail egg. Now as all sushi aficionados are well aware, sushi won't taste good if it isn't fresh, and especially Uni. The only way to have it is if it's really fresh. Well the Uni tasted like they had just scooped it out of the sea urchin 5 min before they served it to us. The hamachi toro, kampachi, oysters on the half shell were all just as fresh. In fact, every piece of sushi we had tasted like it had just come off the boat in Tsukiji.  Fresh sushi in the middle of the desert, who knew!  After several sushi \"appetizers\" and a couple more mini kegs or of beer we decided to just stay at Sake Rok. As I said the place was virtually empty when we first came in but by this time the early dinner crowd started coming in. We were continuing our seafood and beer fest when a couple of martini glasses filled with an oyster and sake, compliments of the chef. Well we just had to meet him. Executive Chef Bobby Silva came out and we were so humbled to be in the presence of this culinary master. We chit chatted for a couple of minutes and then went back to our feast. Now we were hungry...  So aside from the amazing sushi, they had Wagyu beef on the menu. Specifically, a 42oz tomahawk ribeye topped with foie gras butter. We wanted to see what it looked like before we ordered so they brought one out for us to look at. This thing was a behemoth - at least 3\" thick and 3' long with the bone! Challenge accepted, we ordered it and split it between the two of us. Well they made a big production when they brought it out. There was a lot of smoke and drums and other things that we didn't pay attention to. The steak was unbelievably tender, if it wasn't already cut up for us we could have used a butter knife to cut it. Seasoned just right and the foie gras butter really brought out the flavor of the meat. Yes, I'm proud to say we finished the entire steak. It was one the best steaks I've had in a long time (and we had dinner at Gallagher's Steak House 2 nights before). Again we had to compliment the chef so we invited him to share a couple shots of the sake that we had with our meal.  After six hours and two different staffs, we were finally done eating. We paid for our meal but decided to stay and have a couple of drinks on their outdoor patio area on the third floor. Much to our surprise our drinks were on the house. We ended up closing the place. The bartender had to come up to tell us they were closing as there was no staff upstairs. On our way down, the restaurant was much the same way as when we first got there - empty.  Sake Rok is definitely going on the rotation of restaurants that we go to each time we visit Las Vegas. I highly recommend it go on yours too. Thank you to Executive Chef Bobby Silva and his entire staff for the way they treated us. We were just a couple of old guys that happened to stumble into the restaurant and the staff treated us like we were special.   If you enjoy really good, authentic sushi (rolls are neither authentic nor good), then go to Sake Rok. You won't be disappointed.",

If I wasn't pigging out on their superb dishes, I was completely entranced by all their performances. My phone's battery was still 85% by the end of the night because I was hardly ever on it. I didn't need to be since there was so much enjoyment going on all over. The only time I took it out was to take pictures of the girls and I since we were having such a blast. Do not come here expecting a quiet, sit down dinner because they will have you on your feet dancing before you even finish that sake bomb you just downed! Good times are to be had here and I will definitely come back in the near future.",

I think the performers out way the service staff because it took at least 30 minutes to order and get drinks for a table of six. My friends and I were ready to drink so only getting our drinks right before sushi was disappointing. That means I only had 1 drink. So they missed out on us spending more. My fiance got the drink that smoked. When it came to the table though it was such a disappointment. Just a little smoke in a box. Looked a lot like blowing out a candle to me.  I'm gluten free so the server was able to recommend a few options and even keep sauces on the side with gluten. They also had gluten free soy sauce. This may not seem like a big deal but it's been difficult to find gluten free sushi so I really appreciate their accommodations.  I liked the show throughout the meal. It was definitely entertaining to watch. We had to wait for a longtime on the check too. So by the end I was over the performance.",

Great music with DJ on site playing fun music.  The sushi was excellent and the presentation of the food left me in awe! All the waiters were so fun. They weren't only our waiters but at random times throughout the night, they put on short shows for everyone with dancing and singing. Definitely enjoyed my first experience and will be back.",

The complexity of flavors is absolutely masterful and is 5 stars all the way down to presentation and execution. Every single roll or dish I've had here has surpassed expectations. Order anything, it's going to be amazing.  The service has been impeccable with friendly, knowledgeable and attentive staff, and the entertainment is on par. They have a show where all the staff participate in dancing and singing and involving the guests. The whole experience from walking through the door to leaving has been amazing. Highly recommended, will dine again.",

    "text": "This place needs to be appreciated for what it is. It's a great entertainment venue. Wait staff performs quite often, and it's a fun place to go if you want to party. The food quality is decent. The hamachi Serrano, togaroshi salmon sashimi, and rock shrimp were some of our favorites. The hanger steak was chewy, almost jerky like. The toro was terrrible!! Do not get the toro! I have never seen toro with an oxidized tint of color like that, but still took a chance to try. It was super watery, almost like it had just been defrosted and needed a little more time. The spicy tuna hand roll was pretty good. Overall, I would give the food 3 stars. Stick to the basics, because this place should not be judged by food. The prices are steep, but you're mostly paying for experience and atmosphere to party. Service is what it is for the fact that they stop and dance for you almost every 30 minutes. Servers are not very knowledgeable about sushi, sake, or the menu. However, they are great performers. Our total bill was $260 for two people with a moderate amount of food. If you're looking for quality food, and a nice romantic dinner then this place is not for you. If you're looking for a place to pre party with small bites and great entertainment, you've found your spot !",

This was the most fun we had on our trip, hands down. From the amazing customer service, to the perfectly crafted cocktails and fresh delicious food I couldn't complain about a single thing. The staff was so friendly and fun they made you feel like family! Our group was offered a free round of sake bombs and shortly after the staff performed to Madonna's Vogue! I can't wait to go back, I definitely recommend this place to everyone!",

The bartender Frank was so genuinely personable and attentive, and made amazing food & drink recommendations.  He was super accommodating to make sure nothing I ordered contained anything I am allergic to (wasabi, in a sushi restaurant, how annoying am I?)   The Whiskey on the ROK cocktail spoke to my whiskey loving soul. Frank even educated me about the cherry on the garnish.  To start, I went with his recommendation of the crispy rice. It was an incredible flavor and texture combo, with just enough spice.  I will never NOT get this dish when I go there.  I went again with recommendations and next got the tiger roll and the Brussels sprouts. The tiger roll was awesome, but how often does a vegetable impress you?  The sprouts were the perfect texture.  The hospitality in this place was crazy on point.  I had conversations with the Chef (Joe, great food!!!) and manager, Craig.  Since I went for lunch, I missed the entertainment that happens nightly.  When asked about what goes on, Craig took the time to take me on a tour of the restaurant, and explain to me the different aspects of the entertainment.  He even pointed out interesting facts of the place (local artist for the murals on the walls, which is a nice touch!)   Overall, obviously very impressed with this place, and will be back with friends, so we can catch the entertainment, and try more amazing food!",

He chose this place and overall things were great. We seemed to have like 5 different servers, people were constantly coming to make sure we didn't need anything; everyone was very attentive. Our food was really good, but a few things we wished would have been listed on the menu, neither were a huge deal. For the king crab cali roll, it was not listed that the crab was actually a crab salad. We were expecting just a piece of crab inside, not a mayo based mixture. We both hate mayo. Also the brussel sprouts were coated in some type of breading. Not tempura. Either way, they weren't listed as breaded on the menu. We would've skipped both of these items had it been described as such. The sake was good also and they had a dj who was really good. Problem is, it was like 5pm and the music was so loud it was comical. I get it, it's saturday, it's vegas. But it's 5pm. Also there was only one other table besides us. So we just got to yell at each other. Either way it was fun. Loved the decor as well!",

We happen to find this place conveniently located right across the street from our hotel, The Monte Carlo. We walked in, and the first thing I noticed was the cool artwork/murals on the brick walls. We sat down & ordered our food, which came out pretty quickly. The sushi dishes were pretty small portions, but it was still delicious. As we were eating, all of the sudden, the music turned up, and next thing we knew all the staff were running around dancing, getting up on the bar dancing to disco music!! It was awesome:) Such entertainment! I'd recommend this place, although it was a little pricey for the portions you get, it's still worth experiencing.",

We sat down and shortly after was greeted by the server, he was very sweet, polite and asked if there were certain foods we don't like or can't have then he recommended items on the menu just because my client is a SAKE ROK virgin.   While waiting for the drinks and food the MC was going around the restaurant introducing himself, cracking jokes and interacting with all the guest. Then the staff started to sing and dance and my client looks at me and says \"I haven't even had their food and I love this place already\" lol.  Food came out looked great and tasted dangerously good \"not surprised\" since I've been there before but my client looked at me again and was like WOW!!! lol  If you want great food, atmosphere and entertainment this is the best place to throw any occasion. Perfect of buy outs, birthdays, bachelor/bachelorettes parties and more.   Heads up if it is your birthday or anything special the MC will pick on you lol. Your whole table will be challenged on who drinks the sake faster, then he'll put you on stage and start dancing and singing to you.   Don't say I didn't warn you. You'll have a great time.",

I thought it's a Japanese restaurant so I expected to be more quiet side but this place is very loud with shows and music.  Would t recommend to anyone who wants to eat authentic sushi  Read his sarcastic response! This is the type of service you will get! This place  is plain terrible both food and service.

I went with my family for dinner and we were thoroughly entertained! The MC, Cesar, had a wonderful witty sense of humor and his dance moves, along with the servers, were totally awesome! I loved the memoire of the backstreet boys and N'Sync! I'm definitely going back here on my next trip to Vegas and hoping Cesar is the MC for the night!:)",

    "text": "I am at a loss as to why this place got raving reviews. The staff was so friendly and nice but this is the worst sushi I've had in years. The sushi at our local super market in podunk Alaska was better than this. I asked the waiter (who was super nice) how many pieces the one roll had before I ordered. He said 8 and assured me that they're a really good size. It came out with 5 TINY pieces for each roll. It tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and the rice was hard and stale. I asked him if it was a half order and showed him a pic of other volcano rolls on Yelp. He looked at my sushi and said \"uhhh yeah that doesn't look like a volcano roll at all\" so he talked to the sushi chef. I guess the chef told him it was in fact the volcano roll which I found so odd. It was inedible and I had to ask it be taken off my bill. I was REALLY looking forward to sushi and it was just downright bad. I DID however love the honey toast. So good. I'd go back just for that but the sushi was gross. I regret not taking a picture for the review but I was just so turned off. Oh and if you don't want loud house music while eating your dinner, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Last night on Mother's Day my best friends and I decided to go eat at Sake Rok since it was close to the hotel our friends were staying at. As a local in the industry and walking by the restaurant numerous times I was really excited to try this place. When we arrived the sad looking hostess (the young rude short blond hair) asked us if we had a reservation and we told her we didn't. Mind you no one was waiting and no one walked in while we were waiting for 10 minutes for a table to be put together which is totally fine because we had a table of 8. As we were patiently waiting, the hostess was giving us really mean looks that made us uncomfortable. She also turned to my best friend and told her she couldn't bring in a water bottle in the restaurant for her 3 year old child. The hostess then told us that, \"they started the music and people started dancing so it will be another 5-10 minutes to seat us.\" Just from the first impression we were not excited anymore and immediately left. We walked to Tom's Urban where we were seated immediately and spent over $500 on last nights dinner not including the generous tip we gave our awesome waiter! Sake Rok could have been a great experience if our hostess was more welcoming but maybe she should be in the back washing dishes if she can't seem to put a smile on her face and turn on her customer service skills. It's too bad really because our first impression made us immediately not interested in trying what could have been really great sushi in Vegas. Good luck, I can see why Mother's Day there was not a big hit.",

The sushi itself was pretty typical. I liked the squid and shiso leaf nigiri. I gave it 4 stars because the staff was nice, sushi decent, and price was not ridiculous for the strip.

We were a party of 12 and were seated right away. Because we were a large group and in town for a special occasion they made us a tasting menu and we ate family style.  EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!   The food was fantastic and reminded me of Katsuya in Los Angeles.   The miso cod is absolute perfection and melts in your mouth, the hamachi was fresh and to die for and the Godzilla platter, complete with a massive toy Godzilla breathing smoke when presented to the table was sushi heaven!!!   The entertainment was fun and as much as I sometimes want to resist being pulled into silly cover performances, well, I just couldn't help myself.  They were all very sweet to make a fuss over me celebrating this exciting new chapter. They had my name flashing on the projector and even the tasting menu they printed for our party showed me a little personal love for celebrating my bachelorette at Sake Rok.   An excellent choice for going big and wild for a birthday or other special event.  Still fantasizing about the shrimp dishes and the steak entree too.  Will back the next time I find myself in Las Vegas!",

However, I have encountered the rudest service I've ever encountered. My friends and I were at the bar and decided to move to a table to better talk and eat.  The hostess was super sweet and had a table made for our party of 6. I'm assuming our \"server\" came over and we couldn't hear him and we didn't acknowledge him, but he rolled his eyes at us and just left.  At this time, a busser came over and dropped off waters, and my friend ordered a round of saki bombs for the table.  The waiter then came back and asked if we'd like anything to drink, my friend stated that she ordered it from the busser. He again, just walked away, and started talking about my friends and I to another server.  After this, we decided to head to the bar, close out our tab; then the waiter looked surprised when he went back to an empty table.  I get that doing your job in a loud place can be difficult, but this was ridiculous. It was a Tuesday and it wasn't even busy.  Thank you, but no thank you.",

Hey told me I needed to move gave me no new seat just expected to me to grab my plate and figure it out. I had no problem moving but a little bit of customer service would have been nice rather then telling me, \"I am the general manager and this seat is saved and u need to move\"!!!!!!! I will never return to this place again only because of Michael and his horrible service!!!!!!!!!",

He seemed confused when we asked him questions about the menu, which was very off putting.  The rolls weren't anything special either.  The Rok & Roll, which is their signature roll, was bland. The presentation was fabulous! But the taste was just lacking.  The Volcano Roll tasted better than the Rok & Roll, but still failed to meet expectations. It was supposed to have a Spicy Dynamite Sauce, but I didn't even taste it. Eel, cream cheese, spicy snow crab and scallop- all those things were in the roll but I simply did not taste.  But if you really have to come and eat here, I would recommend the Rok Shrimp Tempura, because it was the only good dish that we had.",

    "text": "I stopped by to check out the restaurant week $50 fixed menu on a thur at 5:30 PM for a party of 3.  My previous visit was for quick drinks and appetizers before catching a concert and I had a blast.  I was excited for a sit down dinner experience at the high energy Sake Rok!  Service:  4/5 The hostess, our lead server and all the other servers helping out and bringing our food and keeping the drinks filled were awesome.  Everyone was very friendly and engaging and the emcee leading the sake bombs stopped by to say hi to my teenage niece and her grandmother.   Other than having to wait 30 minutes for our restaurant week mochi dessert, and 20 more minutes for the honey toast we ordered, the service was top notch.  A huge party of 60+ came in right before dessert  I found out they were Cisco employees who were coming in before going to the T-Mobile arena for their Cisco live concert. I understand service might slow down, but I'm pretty sure they knew this group was coming in and it didn't appear they were completely prepared.  This doesn't take away from the awesome staff.  Restaurant week $50 Dinner Course: 4/5 Edamame:  Fresh edmame and very tasty with the Sea Salt and Lime Hanger Steak:  The highlight of the dinner, delicious and prepped perfectly for me at medium rare.  The Mushrooms and the Aka Miso sauce were fantastic.  Coming back for this. Sushi: Chef chose your 4 piece Nigiri and I selected the 1/2 Kamikaze roll.  No issues considering this is a high volume fusion restaurant with sushi. Mochi:  You get 3 assorted flavor mochi which was perfect.  Madre went with the Sata Andagi/Japanese doughnuts which were tasty. Off the restaurant menu we ordered the squid nigiri which was fine and the Honey Toast which was excellent.  They didn't skimp on the Ice Cream and Berries well done.  Ambiance: 5/5  I love the Ultra modern Neo Japanese deco. I love that there's an emcee leading the sake bomb charge and that the servers do dance shows throughout the night. The \"Godzilla Platter\" presentation is a spectacle that's fun. The Emcee and DJ keeps the energy up vibe lively.  Value: 3.5/5 The restaurant week menu gave pretty good value in my opinion.  It's a little cheaper than what we would have paid off the menu but the in house entertainment is where the real value kicks in.  Sake Rok is a great place to grab a quick bite and drinks before seeing a concert at T-Mobile of partying on the strip.  It's loud, fun and the in house entertainment (and booze) will get you ready for a night out.  There are lots of great opportunities for Social Media pics and videos to keep your followers entertained.  I will be back for the sake rok craziness.  Enjoy.. =)",

I can eat it all as long as it's still not moving. .   When I go out to eat sushi the quality of the food and the ambience are important to me. Sake Rok is a sports bar sushi restaurant so as long as you don't mind the voices of a loud referee and screams over your shoulder every time a play is made to sushi then ok... this is the place for you. It's relatively inexpensive but then again... All depends on what you want. Not for me personally. I like a quieter atmosphere with a cozier ambience.

So I came here to celebrate one of my best friends Candy R for her birthday. You ever have those moments where it like not planned where you want to eat and you just spontaneously come up with somewhere to celebrate at the last minute? Yeah.. that's exactly what happened and how we ended up here. This place is a bit hidden as I had to call and ask them exactly where they were located. When I walked across the street I just had to look and see the sign.. silly me. But no they are low key ducked off. Next to California Pizza kitchen I finally found them!   When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server who ended up actually being somebody who performs in the live shows that they do. Kind of cool right it was funny watching her take our orders and then run to go do all this dancing on the stage. Multi-tasker much? Yes.. That was pretty dope to say the least. The service here was actually pretty damn good because of all the attention you get and the fact that they really do a good job insisting that you have a great time. My best friend let the MC Drag Queen know that it was her birthday and she did a wonderful job making sure that it was actually celebrated. They even went a step above by putting her name on the projector camera in big letters wishing her a Happy Birthday.   The food and drinks were okay here...actually the only reason I didn't give them 3 stars was because of the service. Balanced out. I wasn't extremely hungry so I went with the wagyu beef sliders. They were okay and my friends ordered a bunch of other items. We all just shared each others plates because well sharing is caring right? RIGHT! The best dish of them all probably had to be the pork chop dish. I'm not huge on pork and only eat it every blue moon. One of our friends is vegan so she had a separate menu to order off of. The tofu dish that she ordered was a bit bland and it was just missing something... The prices here are high but expected because you are on the strip.  Bottom line is if you are up for a place that you can eat and enjoy some interesting entertainment then this is your place. If you love Sake Bombs then you will have a blast here because they do these random times throughout the night where they have people order Sake Bombs and chug them in sync... Follow those Sake bombs by Backstreet Boys and super loud music.. Have fun!",

Because Sake Rok is a total party atmosphere, complete with an MC, dance routines, a ridiculous number of shots, and crazy-loud music. Sake Rok isn't a restaurant so much as it's an immersive experience with food. It wasn't what I expected at all, but our large group had a great time!  The menu features mostly sushi dishes, with expected pricing for the Strip location. Splurge for the Godzilla sushi platter or a handful of apps and rolls to share. Standouts for us were the Sashimi Tacos (eat them fast or the shells will get soggy!), Rock Shrimp Tempura (great spicy kick!), Japanese-Style Elote (didn't expect to like this but it was a hit at the table!), and the Honey Toast Boat (easily enough to feed 10). Everything was beautifully presented, fresh, and full of flavor. There are entree and steak dishes for those in your party who don't like it raw.  Service was attentive, especially the host who was leading the dance routines, interacting with diners, and encouraging the consumption of sake bombs. I have no idea how he was still standing after the first hour, but he had a great personality and went out of his way to make a personal connection with guests. Sake Rok wouldn't be my pick for a date night, but if you have a bachelor/bachelorette party or a birthday to celebrate, make a reservation!",

Nine of us met up here the other night due to the wonderful organizing of Cathey K! Once you enter Sake Rok, you can feel the high energy...an energy created by not only the wall decor and lighting, but more importantly, by the talented staff and specifically, the host. The host on this evening was wearing lots of makeup, with a skimpy Mick Jagger-like wardrobe. And throughout the evening, he was continuously interacting with the audience/patrons, thoroughly engaging, while demonstrating his True gift--singing, dancing,  pleasing, and imploring bottoms-up Sake bombs as fast as anyone in the restaurant...he could make a sake-bomb fan out of a monk if given the chance. Throughout all our dinner, he was entrancing, leaving many of us enamored with the group dances and general uplifting vibe of the floor.    And about the food: -Chef selection 40 piece Sashimi Platter -Amber Jack Nigiri -Uni Nigiri -Sashimi Tacos -Berkshire Pork Dumplings -Soba Noodles -Honey Toast Boat...the biggest one you will ever see  All their Nigiri courses came with one piece...I enjoyed the Uni Nigiri very much with its fresh ocean flavor. The dumplings were very flavorful, though rather small. The honey toast came with some great macaroons in a variety of flavors, while the boat itself was so delightful that I literally tore that boat in to pieces...yummy. My love enjoyed the Soba noodles very much, but the noodles were too al dente for my liking.  The service the staff provided us was 3 dimensional...There was the typical service you would get at a restaurant, plus entertainment by not only the super-energized and talented MC, but also by all the wait staff...at some points, even the chefs were dancing to the beat!  I will definitely come back with a group of friends...and you may even catch me up on stage with them dancing along to the party!  - 2017 Review #44 -",

They should try serving it with little rice cracker chips -Tiger Roll, El Chapo Roll, ROK & Roll - everything pretty much had fake crab in it, so meh.   Ambiance: This place is not for food, it's for sake bombs and entertainment. I enjoyed the free little show. The MC was energetic and flamboyant and they did a boy band set with a mix of NSYNC and Back Street Boys, so that was right up my alley! Super entertaining and fun. This place is perfect for a bachelorette party. It is SUPER LOUD in here and conversation is IMPOSSIBLE. This place is not a place for kids. The MC drops F-bombs, and it's basically a club atmosphere.  Service: Our service was ok. Water re-fills were attentive and our food came out quickly. I tried to order a virgin mojito and they came back and said they didn't have any mint leaves. :-(  Tip: Ask for a seat downstairs and in the middle so you can see everything during shows.  Note: Bathroom is unisex so everyone goes in the same door and washes hands at the same sinks (bathroom stalls are individual and the door/wall goes from floor to ceiling). There is a bathroom attendant (again club feel).  Won't be back.",

We also went during lunch when there was no one there so I'm not sure if the service is the same when it's busier...  However, the food is not worth the price. The specialty rolls were much smaller in diameter than we are used to--which for $18ish/roll we were expecting heartier, better tasting sushi rolls. All three of the sushi rolls we got were very mediocre in taste.  But the salted lime edamame was the best thing about this place--a large portion and extra salty.",

I've had better sushi rolls at a $20 all-you-can-eat joint in the Midwest suburbs. $20 here gets you two dinky, flavorless and stale maki-mono rolls. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass which was admittedly good, but for $28 it was literally the half the size of my palm with no real side! It was basically just fish with a garnish of pickled veggies and a foam on top. SERIOUSLY?  And I get this is supposed to be a \"rock and roll\" kind of place but the music was SOOOO loud. Like, loud enough to cause some real damage to your ears. I don't mind loud music if I'm at a concert or show, but this was TOO much for a restaurant. My husband and I couldn't even hear a single word we said to each other. In addition, the service was really slooow and hard to track down.  On our trip to Vegas, this was single-handedly the WORST meal of our trip and the biggest regret of us spending as much money as we did at this place. Never again will we get sushi on the Strip, just trek a mile or two on Spring Mountain if you want your sushi fix for a fraction of the price that actually tastes delicious.",

My friend and I ordered the AYCE and was told, \"Oh, I'm going to have to ask if you can use the voucher with AYCE.\"  We said there was nothing in the terms and conditions about not being able to.

Music going on in the background awesome vibe and environment.  The sushi is a bit pricey, but sooooooo good!!! I ordered karage chicken, tried the shishito peppers, sushi, tried a bit of the waygu beef (someone else at the table ordered it.) It all tasted very delicious to me.   Back to what I was saying about not your average sushi restaurant... it's really not; and I'm okay with it! I had so much fun watching and listening to the MC/ host  that was talking and going around the table. They also had an intermission where the staff all danced and was part of a mini show. They also had people dance with them too.   I've never been to a restaurant like this, had delicious food and awesome entertainment. If you're in the area, check it out!!!",

Remember you ar eating in Vegas so prices are high in comparison to food portions. The spicy edamame is amazing.   The tempura roll was also a big hit. I enjoyed the food but not the check. Overall pretty happy with the place",

There are so many unique drinks made with sake with fun combinations which are well presented. I would totally come here for drinks again but skip the sushi. We had the spicy tuna roll and it was very fishy and not spicy at all. We had the rok  and roll and it was not good at all. The only unique roll was the cucumber maki. It looked pretty and tasted ok but nothing special.     The dj show was fun and super entertaining and the staff dancers were surprising good.  Service was good the food came out fast. Like I said come here for the drinks skip the sushi.",

The food was good, but if you really want good sushi, head to the many restaurants in Chinatown. What you're paying for here is the vibe for sure. I purchased a TravelZoo deal and it gave me $125 worth of food for $75... still not enough to feed my family of five as rolls were about $20 each. Again, fun place to go with a group of girls and guys, but expect to pay the Vegas entertainment upcharge for the food.",

The entertainment here alone is worth the 5 stars on Yelp!   They have a ton of fancy schmancy drinks here you can buy. We got the 80oz beer set which came with 80 oz of Kirin in this tiny stainless steel keg and a couple of bottles of sake! Sake Bombs!!!!!  Appetizers here was also bomb too. The tacos are really small but it was delicious. May have to order a few plates for tacos. We had a party of 6, so we ended up with 4 orders which made it 12 pieces of tiny Ahi tacos. The pork belly was WOW! Lots of flavor and super tender.   Our group also ordered the Godzilla platter which I believe was chefs choice. The selection here was okay and for $200 didn't seem worth it. You'd be better off with order individual rolls instead. I think it's that pricey because you get a huge Godzilla platter with a freakish scary Godzilla on it. Lol!   Like most people have said here on Yelp, if you're looking for a quiet place to eat sushi, don't come here. But if you wanna have some fun while eating sushi this place should be on your bucket list!  SAKE ROK.....SAKE BOMB!!!",

We weren't really hungry but wanted to check the place out. Ended up getting the eel avocado roll, shishito peppers and the edamame Rok which is served in an Asian garlic butter chili sauce that is to die for. The food was amazing. I wish I was more hungry and would have gone for the all you can eat sushi deal that they have for $25. That is a steal, especially on the strip. Between the great food, of course tasty sake and awesome bartender,I was super happy. Next time I am in Vegas, I will make sure I am hungry enough for the all you can eat.",

The staff was friendly and they even perform brief dances and shows led by their flamboyant host.   We ordered Sashimi Tacos, Tiger Roll, and Volcano Roll. Though the portions were small, the fish was incredibly fresh. Everything was delicious especially the Sashimi Tacos (be warned... they're tiny)! Tiger Roll was well balanced in terms of texture and taste. Between the two rolls, we would recommend the Tiger Roll for its taste and spice!   We ended with the Honey Toast for dessert. And it is a MUST ORDER. It is a crispy, sweet, and warm delight! It'll also fill you up so we highly recommend saving room for it!",

The headliner goes to all of the tables singing and interacting and ensuring that a fun time is had by all. My favorite part was the Sake Bombs! The host joins you for a sake bomb, although I'm guessing his is non-alcoholic or he'd be pretty wasted from the amount he does throughout the evening! Our table alone had 3 or 4 rounds of these, lol! We had excellent service and enjoyed the singing and dancing. This is a great place to go with friends or on a date. Note: it is loud. If you don't like music and noise while you eat than this place isn't for you. We LOVED it!  We went with another couple who had been there before and had suggestions for what we should eat. We loved the Sake Rok edamame. It had great seasoning! We also enjoyed the hot plate, where you cook the meat on a hot grill at your table like in the Shabu Shabu type place. We also had the Godzilla platter which is different sushi rolls and chef's choice nigiri on a platter with a giant, smoking Godzilla toy. That platter was a bit pricy @ $200, but the sushi/rolls were yummy and the presentation was a blast. It was all part of the fun. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Is there a place to click on 10 stars out of 5??!! This was my first time at Sake Rok and it was quite an experience. That's the perfect word for this is an \"experience\". We went this last Saturday night. It was packed and happening. There were 5 of us, but we were able to be seated within 15 mins.    There's so much to look at that you can get easily distracted by what's happening at other tables or at the bar. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, the staff was spectacular. And I mean ALL of 4 staff,  not just our waitress. I don't even know where to start with this review because I have so many great things to say.   We did the \"Sake Flight\" before we ordered, which is basically 5 different types of sake. You start from one end and work your way up to the other end.  My favorite was the last one which tasted like champagne married sake and had a baby. It was great! You need to try this - so much fun!!!  Then we ordered some appetizers - edamame rok, adagashi tofu and the brussel sprouts. All of these dishes were wonderful, but one in particular has my heart. The brussel sprouts are out of this world!!! I know you may frown upon hearing it has fish sauce in it, but let me tell you,  imagine the best brussel sprouts you've ever had,  then amp that up by 10 points - that's how delicious they are!   We were hesitant to order the huge Godzilla platter because being Asian, we did the math and it didn't add up. Their rolls average $20 each.  In the platter there are 5 rolls and 8 pieces of sashimi for $200. If you order 5 rolls it's closer to $100 & 8 pieces of sashimi can not possibly be another  $100. Anyways we said screw it, let's just order it and see what it's about!!!   Money aside, we were really pleased with how the platter was presented. It came attached to this gigantic Godzilla that had steam (dry ice?) coming out of its mouth. I think the extra cost is for the experience. If you're all about the experience, get the platter!! The sushi tasted great as well.   Throughout the night there were performances by the staff. They are REALLY good dancers and performers. They have some moves! There was someone who reminded me of Aerosmith who hosted, went table to table, gave advice on food,  talked to you, made you feel comfortable, made you laugh, took shots with you-all around great person who made the experience even more magical.   At the end of the meal I went to the restroom and was stunned at all the offerings in there. I was a bit off guard bit in a good way. There was a towel lady there, but they had everything under the sun in there - various types of lotion, perfume, candy, mints, deodorant, etc and maybe my memory decides me, but I swear I saw cigarette packs.   It is loud in there, but it's fun. It has a great vibe. If you want to go have a meal and smile the whole time, listen to great music, have some great service, and enjoy yourself, this is the place for you!! Next time I'm in Vegas, I look forward to coming back.",

We ordered food I forgot what we ordered but it was amazing the food is top notch ..... it was when we were on our second sushi roll that everything just came together . The dj waiters servers and bartenders all broke into dance. They were dancing to *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys Hahhaha my husband looked at me like what the heck Veronica l. And I just didn't know wether to sing a long or what. Very interesting experience defiantly one for the books",

This is the quintessential Las Vegas experience with a show, performed by the servers, that breaks out periodically throughout the night with an engaging MC, great dancers, and plenty of loud music. This isn't the place to dine if you're looking for a romantic night out. This is the place you come to with a good group of friends to party and drink. The food is pretty good, with some dishes surprisingly good, but it's the totality of the experience that makes a night at Sake Rok special. Have fun, drink, laugh, sing, and prepare to be entertained. And, along the way you'll eat some pretty good food.",

We were a party of 6 and when we were seated, I told our server that we wanted the Sake that was on special for \"Sake Sundays.\" She told me that is no longer an offer and I informed her it was still on their website. After checking with someone, she came back and told me they would honer it although its no longer offered. She also suggested the \"chefs special\" at $85/pp which we ordered. Long story short, we ordered several bottles of sake and left there with a $1200 bill. They charges us full price for our drinks. I tried to contact them to speak with a manager but they have not return my call.   The food was good. Entertainment was ok. Dishonest service was unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this place and wouldn't go back.   PS: Their Sake special is still listed on their website.",

    "text": "I would highly advise making a reservation. We stumbled across it, and it looked pretty empty when we arrived but the 4 hostesses at the entrance let us know it would be a 30 minute wait for 2 people. Luckily there is a bar outside to order a drink while you wait. There were people with the same size party and no reservation that got seated before us, so it wasn't off to a great start. Honestly, it did start to fill up quickly as the night went by. I could be wrong and maybe all the other empty tables were all reserved. But the hostesses could have been a little more inviting when we told them we didn't have a reservation.  However, as soon as we got to our table it was nothing but amazing! The wait staff came by every 10 minutes to see if we needed anything. It wasn't just waiting on one server to come around, it was a team effort with everyone working the tables and making sure everyone was taken care of. They were helpful, upbeat, and attentive. Even in between performing. I loved the vibe so much.  There was a DJ and an MC who went through all the tables to make sure everyone was having fun. It was definitely entertaining with everyone breaking out in dance and singing. It happened to be my friends birthday the next day, she was so happy that we came across this!  I've had a lot of great sushi, my standards are a little high. The food was ok, but good enough to where I'm still looking forward to revisiting next time I'm in Vegas. And they had some awesome drink choices.   Despite the drawbacks, this place deserves 5 stars in my book. Looking forward to my next trip there!",

Our waitress was really friendly, but I kept looking at this guy with the flowing locks and wild eye makeup walking around wondering wth. Then the show started, dancing, singing, everyone clapping along, it was terrific and he in particular was awesome. I had no idea what to expect, but when the entire wait staff lined up with sunglasses on and all did the dance to Will Smith's Men in Black song with the video on the giant screen in the background, I lost it!

Not only was there excellent service and the food was delicious, my gals and I were entertained by fun performances along with our favorite throwback jams! Definitely favorite new spot on the strip!!",

    "text": "The sushi is great albeit pricey ($17 to $20 for speciality rolls). They do have some more regularly priced rolls that are about the size (six pieces) that you'd expect from a regular california roll (those are about $7 to $10 dollars). The drinks are awesome. The party atmosphere in the evenings is so fun and sure to leave you grinning. The shows that they put on every once in a while are HILARIOUS. The servers are all sweet and charming. The MC is a blast and an absolute oddball.   The show stealer though is the dessert! The honey toast is PHENOMENAL. Unreal. It is so like the most amazing french toast you could ever dream. Sweet and crunchy but also moist.   Also, FYI this place stays open to about 11/12 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.",

Makes one wonder if their fish is also of lowest quality. Did not order any fish and walked out.",

Our waitress (who I believe was training) was not only knowledgeable but also full of energy.  She gave some amazing suggestions ( Omasake sashimi and Dragonfly cocktail) which were both so delicious! Jenny, our waitress even got me to get up and dance to Lady Gaga! Which was something I was not expecting to do that night but so glad I did! She and the other staff made the night memorable for myself and my friends! I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can eat/dance there again!",

    "text": "This place has such an amazing atmosphere but the food is just average and so is the service.  When my friends and I arrived we were told there would be a 20 min wait when the restaurant was empty. This was 8:30p on a Tuesday night. We read the Yelp reviews and wanted to try the place out.  When we finally got our table about 15 minutes later we sat for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement and no menu. When a table that was seated 5 min after us received service we flagged down the nearest server and asked for a menu. The menu was obnoxious and fun. You get one huge one for your table to share.   There's great art on the wall and I loved the music (90s mix) it was cute when the staff performed a back street boy and NSync dance-off.  Now the food... It was pretty pricey and not really to die for. My friend ordered a roll expecting rice and the sushi was brought out on cucumbers. It was good but a shocker bc the menu didn't even make it clear you would be eating the raw fish on a cucumber instead of rice. The same friend ( maybe she was just having bad luck? ) also ordered their smallest bottle of sake ( 100 mL ) and our waitress brought her a 400 mL bottle. The waitress said they don't have the 100mL that is on the menu. The 400 mL was supposed to be $40 but we're only charged the $10 we ordered so that wasn't too bad.  This place just opened five months ago I believe and has so much potential of their staff service can match the awesomeness of the interior. I loved the decor so much and the food wasn't disgusting. Will I eat here again? Maybe.",

Each roll being at least $16, we were highly disappointed when the first roll we tried fell apart before it even got off the plate. We ordered the volcano roll (which fell apart), tiger roll, and the dos chi-charrones. The dos chi-charrones was the only unique roll, as it was like a burrito roll. 2 of the rolls (tiger and volcano) were the highly popular ones as well, marked in red on the menu.  Staff were friendly and the place was clean. I think this would be a great place for a late night lounge place ad they had the lights and the projector as well as a dj booth.  Unfortunately, we aren't able to check it out.",

    "text": "Came to this place because it had high yelp reviews. The food is decent, the food is pricey but the service was VERY disappointing.  My group was a party of 7 and we called in advanced to make reservations for dinner since we were out celebrating. When we arrived, we were greeted and sat immediately. There were 2 other tables with groups of 2-3 people - Not sure if they had an outside area but those were the only people we saw in the entire restaurant including the upstairs.  As we were settling into our table, a gentlemen came over to ask if we were planning to do any of their 80oz sake bombs; we weren't so he removed the kegs from our table and was never seen again. Once he left we sat there for a good 20 minutes before anyone else tried to talk to us. When someone did come to talk to us, it was one of the restaurant's main entertainer who came by to let us know that there was going to be a show that night before wandering off to the other groups inside the restaurant.  A completely different guy finally took notice and apologized that we hadn't been serviced yet. He had assumed that someone else was already taking care of us. Since no one actually was...he went ahead and started getting us water and taking our food order.   When the food started coming out, the entertainer from earlier was the one bringing our food out. It was very nice of him to do so, but also very odd since it looked like they had 15 other people on staff just standing around and some goofing off with each other (besides the two chefs in front). I assume he (the entertainer) did that because the show he was leading was just about to come on. Once the show began, it looked like the staff didn't want to interrupt him and the performers, so they stood idle with the rest of our orders and began dancing with each other until it was over.   After our food was delivered, there was literally no interaction with the staff. Through out the evening, no one came back to check on us for refills or see if there was anything else that we needed. The restaurant also never got busier from when we got there. We ended up having to flag someone down ourselves to let them know that one of the girls never received her food. We waited so long that the whole group literally finished all of their food and her one item still never came. Because the staff seemed like they were busy talking amongst themselves and ignoring us, we ended up having to walk over to ask them to cancel the item.   Then a girl finally came over to give us a refill on water which was the first for us (and after we had finished our food). We asked her for our check since the other guy who took our order was nowhere to be seen. He did bring our check though and when we reviewed our bill, the restaurant added a 22% gratuity! Now we understand that we are a group of 7 but we've eaten at other restaurants on the strip plenty, and the most we've ever seen was 18%. Asked our waiter about it to see if that was their standard and he seemed less friendly this time - basically said yep and walked away. Seems rather silly considering one of the girls never even ate since they failed to bring her food out and the service was just flat out terrible. We weren't going to make a big fuss over it, but I don't think we will come here again because it was not a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "My wife, friends and I went to Sake Rok last night based on a recommendation of a local denizen. To summarize, we were underwhelmed and would not return.  It's an interesting concept- dance club and sushi. There's a DJ who plays mostly 80's music (which I like), but the ambience was extremely loud and noisy. Perfect to go with someone you don't want to talk to.  The service- we had two servers. One was new and training. I had to ask for sake at least 5 times throughout the meal. They just kept forgetting each time I asked. When I made the reservation, the woman asked if there was any special occasion. I told her that we had just gotten married and were on our honeymoon.  When we arrived, she congratulated us, asked for and wrote down my wife's name. Throughout the evening the DJ (dressed as Sho-nuf from The Last Dragon, if you're old enough to remember that one) was giving shout-outs to all the young ladies celebrating weddings and birthdays. He never acknowledged my wife. I don't know, maybe it was because we are in our fifties.  The price- $200 for four people. I can't complain about that especially for Vegas.  Summary- I think this place would be best for the younger crowd that enjoys loud music.  Actually, a table of twenty-somethings left after perusing the menu and without ordering. The food is par, nothing special. The DJ was friendly, affable and congenial. But we would have enjoyed the meal more without that concept.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place! Miso cod and blueberry Bunny sparkling sake? Say no more!   It's 9pm on a Wednesday night (we dine everywhere with our 9 month old baby-luckily he's behaved). We ask the hostess for a table and a high chair, she informs us no kids allowed after 7pm \"due to the provocative dancing and music\". Ok no problem! So we sit outside. After waiting 15 mins (keep in mind the hostess who sat us is literally right in front of us this entire time, maybe 10 feet away) my husband asks if we can get that high chair we asked for or a server. At this point I normally would have left but we were already situated with the baby and I really was in the mood for this miso cod.   We ordered their sake cocktail (which was the highlight of the dinner), edamame, some color me roll (simple but good), cucumber salad (funkier than the normal but ok), rock shrimp (good), a side of this coconut rice (awesome! They said it was made with coconut milk and coconut flakes).......  And then we asked for the \"steamed vegetables\" specifically told her no salt or sauce that it was for the baby. It came out covered in oil and sesame seeds.......  After the majority of our food comes out (930pm ish) a stroller with a baby comes out of the restaurant-I thought how strange considering we were told we weren't allowed to sit inside with a child. So unless that child had been in there since 7 (2 and a half hours earlier) kinda irritating.  Once all of our entire order made the table the server came back to let me know the kitchen was out of cod. Literally we were done with everything by this point. She said they could make it with salmon (she had seen it done, but never tried it). 10 mins later the salmon made it to the table. It was surprisingly really good, plated with peppers and a coconut foam.  The two stars is specifically for the sake cocktail and coconut rice, I will have to get my miso cod elsewhere because we won't be back.",

The only reason I'm even giving this a 2 is due to the Art Deco and the food was good... Not great.   Our server Vince didn't listen when I asked for lemon with my Voss water, so my husband had to get up and go up to the bar.  Once the food was dropped off we had to wait another 5 minutes for the soy sauce.  Oh did I mention I also asked for a straw in which my husband once again had to get up and grab it from the bar!!   So basically the only time we saw our server Vince was when he took our order and when we finish eating he asked how it was and gave us the check...very inattentive server.",

There's also a host that keeps the dinner lively and pulls people up to dance with the servers. DJ played great music, giving the place a loungey vibe.   We ordered the Hana Berri and Dragonfly Cocktails. Both were yummy! We also shared the edamame, ceviche, and the El Chappo roll. All were light and tasty. Our server was excellent. The Sake bombs were going off all over the restaurant so we had to try it. So much fun, we had two rounds. Sake Rok is a unique dining experience and just what Vegas needs! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!",

The drink were very good I started with a dragon fly which had this light sweet taste of dragonberry and strawberry sour it was honest the most delicate things I'd definitely order that again. I also had a sangria I don't remember exactly which one but it was very tasty, a gentlemen at the table next to us bought me a drink to celebrate as well it was a red gesha the drink was a really interesting combo not like things I've tried other places. The drink was well mixed and pour but it had a strong aftertaste if almond and I actually don't like almonds but the drink I believe was still very good. The food was amazing too I enjoy each dish that came out even tho I'm not big on sushi at all. The place changed my expectations on what a good night out should be!!!! While the staff was incredible the food was fantastic and the venue was gorgeous and stimulating to the eye the best part had to have been Cesar, I am very grateful to his kindness and the fun time he showed me my sister's! Because of my experience, the next time I'm in Vegas I am DEFINITELY coming back to Sake Rok!",

In fact we just like to go out and have fun and I think we picked the best place to celebrate. You walk in and are greeted by two hostess in sleek dresses,smiling and ready to seat you. There is a short wait so my beau and I head to the bar for a drink. The male bartender hands us the ridiculously big menu ( I think there should be a separate cocktail menu ) I order the Hana berri cocktail which is sake and sparkling sake and something else the drink was ok not anywhere in my top 10. The beau orders a tall Japanese beer, I should have ordered that instead. We get sat next to a two top table by the sushi bar. Perfect seating to see everything! When I say everything I'm talking about the performance, the waiters, and food runners coming out of the kitchen, and the tall male manager talking into an ear piece and putting his hand very low on the hostess back who looked like she needed to ask something (awkward) I felt that was inappropriate. I'm not a prude but it made me feel like I saw something I shouldn't have seen. Anyways our server comes over younger thin guy I think named Eric and he begins his spiel he is knowledgable of the menu and gave us superb service! Even though the place was busy he did a great job of recommending food. After he takes our order another server comes up Named DJ and he begins to do a spiel. We let him know Eric already took our order and the face DJ flashed was kind of an annoyance. My only suggestion would be for the team to have more communication going on. Other than that the food was good top choices are the pork belly seaweed salad and any specialty rolls. Food was great performance was fun and service was good.",

During our dinner, they danced to 2 songs which was really fun! The sushi is good (not the best) but overpriced. Some specialty rolls have a fun play on flavors which are great to try if you're adventurous and they also have your regular rolls of tuna, eel and avocado, eel and cucumber, etc if you want your typical rolls. Everything we tried was fresh. There's a good variety of apetizers but the weird thing is we ordered the dumplings and they were served in halves, 5 of them, what happened to the 6th half (that would make for 3 whole dumplings)? Did it get served to another table? The drinks are tasty, as expected at $14. The place is spacious with 2 floors and the decor is bare brick walls with cool Japanese inspired paintings. Heads up: it is a loud place making it hard to have a conversation.",

The staff seem friendly but I only saw them for a few seconds. The menus are ridiculously large for no reason and you have to share them so picking food takes twice as long.   The entertainment included a flamboyant guy and employees dancing to gangnam style for about 2!minutes while wearing shutter shades, the popular style from 2008.  The food was really delicious I just wish I actually had more than a bite. This is the smallest portion in an asian restaurant I've ever had (at least for this price).   The mixed shrimp and vegetable tempura is about $16 and you get 3 pieces of shrimp, 1 carrot, 1 asparagus, and quarter of an onion deep fried. Thats more of an appetizer than a meal.   The pork dumplings were also around $16 and you get 5 small sized dumplings that were slightly larger than a quarter. It tastes good but you finished it in about 5 seconds.   The spicy samurai roll was very delicious but honestly nothing special for such a hefty price once again. Its basically spicy tuna and some eel with avocado inside. Im pretty sure that was close to $20.   All together the bill was over $50 and im hungrier than when I got here.",
