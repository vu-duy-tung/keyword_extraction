    "text": "My husband and I were looking for a new place for breakfast last week and we truly found a gem!!! After reading the great reviews, we took the trek all the way from Aliante and we were not disappointed. Although there was a line (inside and outside of the restaurant), we were greeted with a warm smile by Shaun. He told us the wait would be about 30 minutes. When we mentioned it was our first time here, he promised we would be well taken care of. It was no nice to see a restaurant where guests are treated like welcomed guests to their  home.         Our first experience was so wonderful, we came back and brought my son along. My husband and I were welcomed back by Kat and Shaun. It was so great that they remembered us. The owner, Nick came over and spoke to us and thanked us for coming back. The food is absolutely delicious and freshly made to order. Lourdes, our server, went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect. My husband and son appreciated the huge plate sized pancakes and I enjoyed their corned beef hash that is freshly prepared in house. The customer service is amazing! Everyone is so kind and the servers are so attentive, without being intrusive. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed. I highly recommend that you try Mr. Mamas for breakfast or lunch. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is welcoming, and you are treated like family. It is well worth the trip from any location in the valley. Thank you Nick for treating my family so well. My son really enjoyed his conversation with you. ( As a college senior he is not easily impressed, but you did just that.) Thank you Shaun, Lourdes, and Kat for making our second visit even more wonderful than the first.",

    "text": "this place is by far the best breakfast place in Vegas. If you're here on vacation or just a party on the strip. This is well worth an Uber or taxi ride to come and try. I could not tell you what was better the service or the food. Everything here is five star from when you first walk in too when you get seated so when you're eating your food all the way till when it's time to pay....  This last time I went which was earlier today. I ordered my food to go. While sitting in the waiting area I was observing how the greeter was. Before you even walk in they are already getting you a table set (if it's not busy) the interact with every customer that comes into that restaurant. I couldn't even call it a customer it make you feel more like a guess or family. Best breakfast brunch spot in Vegas bar none!",

The hostess and the waitress were both very nice but the food was tasteless and not worthy of the reviews! My goodness I ordered the veggie omelet and with egg whites! I only ate half of it because I was very hungry and left the rest! My husband ordered the California omelet and he couldn't eat more than half of it as well. The potatoes were dry and overly done! Thank goodness I gave them to my husband..... after we left surprised to what we just ate and how is this possible to be so bad based of high reviews, I had to go to Starbucks to grab a latte and a energy bar! We travel a lot and we know good food! My husband makes the best eggs and omelets! This place lacked flavor, quality and nothing to brag about! It makes me mad to have wasted our time to eat here. Did they change cooks? I mean even if they did, the recipe should stay the same? I'm just shocked!",

Service was excellent - always a win when everyone is nice to the three year old - and the owner even stopped by our table to check in on us. I'd highly recommend this spot if you need a filling breakfast after a night of partying in Vegas!",

We were packed in the small waiting area, but they have chairs and a small nice seating space - which can get cramped.  The food is delicious! Best pancakes I've had in a long time! I loved that they had smaller orders of the same great meals - the kids (10 and 13) got to get the same adult favorites but in their sizes without being called kids. :)   My chicken fried steak was very yummy and I'd even order it again - super large portions! Family all loved their dishes and the hot chocolate and coffee were perfect. Pancakes are definitely sharable but you could finish them off yourself if you wanted to.   And I love it how they do not pack more tables and chairs in the dining hall just to alleviate the waiting customers. Makes the dining experience more comfortable and roomy. I'm not cramped while eating or playing elbow hockey.  Cathy our server was phenomenal! She has our coffees filled and our order exactly right with the biggest smile and nicest personality. The youngest was even smitten with her and couldn't take his eyes off her. LOL! She was great!  You are definitely eating with family here! Mr. Mama comes around and gives you a smile, shakes a hand and makes sure he took care of you while you were in his house. Loved it! I am definitely coming back!",

    "text": "If I told you that you could eat at a restaurant in Vegas and be treated like it's your family house would you believe me (of course not it's Vegas) that is what we experienced here. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with smiles and warm welcomes. There was a short wait because this place is packed and it's worth it! Our server Roe was incredible, she was so kind and friendly you would have thought we knew each other for years. Ask for Roe when you dine here! On to the food. Oh my oh my the food! Western omelette is perfect and scrumptious. Those breakfast potatoes oh yes please and the cinnamon roll!!!!! I don't like cinnamon rolls particularly but I ate almost the entire thing!!! Honey got the eggs over easy and they were cooked to perfection no color yolks intact! This place is amazing if your in Vegas avoid the big name places and eat local!!!",

We were seated right away but it can get busy. The host was very personable and made great small talk with those waiting to be seated. Service was excellent. Quick, attentive, polite. I could rave about the service alone. Food was standard diner food, good portion sizes to cost, and did I mention so quick! Loved that the side fruit wasn't just melon with pineapple, but all berries. They must actually do seasonal fruit. This place isn't for those with food allergies but as always I think you can navigate to not starve while you're there. Hope you're able to try it!",

Yeah, the service is amazing, and the burgers are excellent. I am not a fan of home fries, but luckily, they offer onion rings. They were perfectly prepared. Our waitress offered a small cup of their homemade ranch dressing (50 cents) to accompany our onion rings.... GET THIS. It is very good. We also had a giant cinnamon roll. Oh, man! It was light and fluffy and melted in my mouth. Also, we never touched the door! They opened it for us upon entry and exit. How cool is that?",

A friend and I went here for lunch on Friday to get breakfast. We arrived at 11:45 and there was a wait to get in. But the guy taking names seemed to know everyone, and if he didn't, you would have thought he did. What a great experience already, and we had to wait! You get a family feel and a friendly vibe from the second you walk in so if you want a great experience, that's what you will get!  Oh yeah, the food. While we were waiting outside for a table, 3 people left saying how outstanding the food was.  Our breakfast was perfect (you'll pay about $9-10 for a 3-egg breakfast with meat), needless to say. My medium eggs were cooked perfectly and so was my extra crispy bacon - thank you very much! And the service was top notch all around. Even the owner stopped by the table to not only check on us, but to chat with us! Super nice guy, even if he did go to Michigan State. (Buckeye fan here).  In summary, I'm hooked and I'll be back, that's for sure! I'll just be sure to get there before the lunch rush hits!",

You have to place your name on the waitlist Sean was the one to take our names, he was great.  And since they have have menus on the counter we were able to see what we wanted while we waited.    Once seated we ordered and food came out about 10 mins laters.  Everyone was so busy but they always ensured we had everything we needed. The service was amazing.  It was so refreshing to have a place with great tasting food and great service.    The breakfast comes in large portions for a great price as well.  My son ordered the mama short stack and couldn't finish it.  The pancakes are the size of the whole plate.  I got the Mamas French toast with strawberries and whip cream and it was so filling.    Overall i would recommend this to anyone.  Thank you Jose for the great service as well!!",

She is VERY attentive and an all around great server. She informed us about the breakfast specials, throwing jokes, and whatnot. The environment is sooooooo energetic and it's just such a positive vibe. Oh, the other employees are very friendly too!!! From the beginning on having the door opened as we entered and finishing up with a checkup by the owner -- Amazing service. Oh, can't forget, the food came out fast! Can't wait to come back for another breakfast service :) thank you so much, Jenna !!!",

The wait staff was extremely attentive,  the place was packed but not too loud and the food was wonderful.   I had the steak and eggs, it was perfectly cooked, with no fat , and the hashbrowns were amazing.   My wife had the chicken fried steak again perfectly cooked and the gravy was to die for , it was like liquid sausage.   Highly recommended,  and definitely someplace I will be visiting again.",

My wife ordered french toast with sausage.  She didn't eat one sausage patty so I gave it a try.  Yuck!  Very soft meat...reminded me of the frozen Walmart brand.  Watched our waitress bring coffee to table next to us, turn and walk away without so much as a glance our way and she then returned with water for the same table and AGAIN left without checking on us.  So I got up and got my own coffee.  That brought our server over and she chewed me out saying she could get into trouble for me doing that.  Later...she ignored us again.  I watched her cater to the same table next to us while both my wife and myself waited to get more coffee.  She again made two trips to the next table without looking our way.  Finally I got her attention from across the room by waving my empty cup in the air.  When she came over she blamed her poor service on us not being the only table she was responsible for, in a snotty way, and that was the last we saw her.  The manager had to take over and even she was overly nice in a very faky, patronizing way.  She asked how our food was so I told her the sausage was no good.  Well, its Hormel she tells me...as if that is the gold standard.  Prices were not as cheap as review sites led us to believe either.  $10 for biscuits & gravy?  No thanks.",

I found the logo rather cute, two men wearing aprons.  This place is locally owned.    After the short wait, we were provided a table.    There is a wide variety of food to select from.  The food portions are pretty big.   I had the eggs Benedict with spinach, tomatoes & ham. I made the mistake of ordering a single order of French Toast. Mistake being way too much food.   The basic orders all come with a large share of hash browns. I mean the serving could easily serve 2 people.   The food was very tasty, the hash browns can be ordered crispy. Which is what we had. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were perfectly cooked. Nice & runny on the yolk. The spinach and tomatoes were fresh. I easily filled up on the food.  Barely had room for the French Toast.  Now the French Toast had the right seasoning of cinnamon & Powdered sugar   The bread was perfectly golden brown & fluffy.    Don't order too much food. The food won't fit on your table. We had to place some of the food on other dishes.   Oh yeah their iced coffee with chocolate is pretty good as well.    Great food & prices!",

They called like 100 names before us and many people left as name after name was called over and over and no parties showed. After waiting an hour and being told, yes, your next, I observed two parties who were seated 30 & 40 minutes before us didn't even have food on their table. No thanks. We left.

I knew it was a good place when I saw the herd of people crowding the waiting area. Of course there was a wait time but this is the first place where the wait time was EXACTLY what they said! And while we were waiting, I believe his name was John kept the mood light by being hilarious.  My bf and I were originally going for breakfast but after looking at their menu we decided to get burgers. I went with the swish mushroom burger and added avocado and the bf ordered the chilli cheese burger. While waiting, the table next to us was receiving their breakfast and the pancakes looked perfectly cooked! They also ordered a cinnamon roll that looked delicious so I had to have one as well. DELICIOUS! Oh the burgers?? TO DIE FOR!! The chilli cheese burger was probably the best that I have ever tasted anywhere.   Small place, but worth the wait!",

    "text": "This was my first stop when I hit town.  I couldn't wait to get another one of Mr Mama's magnificent chicken fried steaks.    Chicken fried steak and eggs isn't something I usually have for breakfast.  In fact, I had never had it for breakfast before having it here.  My mom occasionally made chicken fried steak when I was growing up, but we always had it for dinner.  It's rather a lot of food for breakfast, but Mr Mama's is cool with it if you don't finish it all.  I was really looking forward to this meal.  I had been thinking about their chicken fried steaks ever since I first tried one back in July.   Mr Mama's did not disappoint!  Last time I ordered the gravy on the side because I was concerned I might not like it.  Well, the gravy is outstanding, and I found I like it better served right on the steak.  Last time I got toast, and it was great.  This time I changed it up and ordered a biscuit instead.  SCORE!  The biscuit was outstanding!  And what made it really special was that they split the biscuit, then grill the insides to a crisp toasty finish.  Baby, that's some good biscuit!  The service, again, was absolutely wonderful.  I ordered hot tea.  My waitress made sure I had a fresh cup, a 2nd teabag and hot water half way through my first cup so my second cup would be ready when my first one was finished.     I can't wait to visit Mr Mama's again.  As much as I love the chicken fried steak, I think I'll try something else on the menu next time.  All I know is, whatever I get, I'm definitely getting a little biscuit and gravy on the side.    Mikey C says: Love me some Mr Mama's!",

Not because there was anything wrong, but after reading rave reviews, I was expecting a lot. The corned beef hash was fine, but it was just about as good as everywhere else and I was not impressed. My sister chose the Chicken Fried Steak and this was a much better option. Delicious, though we agreed it needed more gravy and they were happy to provide an additional bowl of it.

The people running this joint are absolutely delightful(:  The manager, Kat , personally greeted us at our table and gave her recommendations- which I love a busy lady who makes time to have small talk with a new patron!  A special shout out to Alex for being so accommodating with our meal!(: As a matter of fact, I think at one point or another every team member from the front of the house either greeted us, checked on us to make sure the food was good, or thanked us for coming while on our way out- this is an outstanding set of waitstaff and you should consider yourself lucky to be in their section!   The seating in this place is well thought out. Though it may be a small diner, they certainly value guest comfort over all else. The entrance is a bit crowded- CUZ EVERYONE WANTS TO EAT HERE(for a good reason). But once you get your table, sit down, you realize that there is so much space! They could fit a few more tables to make money; but don't, and I am so appreciative that I could stretch or scoot my chair back WITHOUT hitting someone behind.   The food was just heavenly! Management of this facility is so confident in their recipes, they give out free samples of all kinds of things- great marketing tactic! Just look at the pictures posted- it is EXACTLY what you will get when ordering!  No BS, no games, great food, great people and great prices! Totally worth the wait for a table!!(:   Ten out of ten guys, thank you for a wonderful breakfast!!  Sincerely, the J's/ feather necklace girl",

    "text": "(Yay my 100th review) I don't normally go out much for breakfast but if I had to then I would definitely recommend Mr. Mama's.     Immediately upon arrival, my family was warmly greeted and tended to by the friendly staff.  They brought a special chair that our baby's carrier/carseat could fit into more safely than their regular chairs (that's going above and beyond good service).  Throughout the course of the meal, the staff came by to say hello and check on all their customers.  They were warm, funny, sincere.  An awesome mom & pop breakfast stop.  We used the $15 for $30 Yelp deal and it was more than enough food for my wife and I and my 3yr old.   We ordered and our breakfast came out so fast even with how busy the place was.  Nice.  I had the country fried steak and with poached eggs and hash browns.   Everything tasted great and the portion was huge.  I brought it home and it was still good later on.  The gravy they use was different, with pieces of bacon and sausage I believe mixed in.  It was good.  My wife had the Mr. Mama's french toast.  Ordered it scrambled eggs and a nice portion of ham.  The french toast came with 4 pieces powdered with sugar.  We also ordered a short stack and honestly, that was ALOT for us.  2 huge plate sized pancakes.   We wished there was an option to get our pancakes topped with either fruit or chocolate.  My daughter loves her strawberry-topped pancakes.  Finally, I also had extra from the Yelp deal, so I ordered their beef soup of the day.  There's soups with beef and then there's' Mr. Mama's beef soup.  HUGE chunks of beef.  Good broth.    4 stars for the food and 1 more star for the GREAT service they provided.  Definitely recommending their breakfast and definitely use this awesome Yelp deal!",

    "text": "Breakfast was in order the day I visited this fairly new eatery. I came with a friend and he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, and I ordered the Marty Wrap which came with scrambled eggs, potatoes, pepper jack cheese, avocado, tomato, garlic, and bacon, but I axed the potatoes, all for $7.25. The wrap came with a side of house made salsa.  The wrap was quite good and came tightly wrapped in a flour tortilla. The scrambled eggs were very good, but the bacon was not only plentiful, but had a great texture and flavor. I enjoyed it very much and it was present in every bite, the way it should be. The avocado was just ripe and creamy, the tomatoes added a nice acidity, and the garlic flavor was very mild. Oh yes, it would of been nice if it had more cheese because I would of liked to have seen it oozing out.   The side of salsa was great. It did not provide much heat, but what it lacked in heat, it made up in flavor. It was zesty, with a garlic flavor, and spot on seasoning. Pouring into the wrap as I ate it, was the ticket. Good stuff...  Service was quite good and our server was friendly and prompt. However I truly appreciated when the floor manager came over to check on us several times and participated in small talk. She was quite genuine.",

I would have to give this restaurant a four and a half star. I ordered one pancake, a cheese and bacon omelet, breakfast potatoes, and toast. We also added their famous cinnamon roll to our order. As everyone knows who reads my Yelp, I like when food is well seasoned. Their potatoes were very well seasoned and they give you a good portion size. The pancake was a buttermilk pancake which was fluffy and good. They make homemade cinnamon rolls which were served soft and warm. The customer service was excellent. Everyone was so welcoming and willing to serve. The prices were not bad but they charge 1.25 if you want salsa on the side. We would definitely return to this breakfast spot.   They also serve lunch.",

Took a group here and ordered several breakfast dishes at their new location. Maybe I overhyped it by mentioning that it was on Yelp's Top 100 list for 2014, but no one at the table was impressed by the food- though the service was consistently good.  The CHICKEN FRIED STEAK & EGGS was the best dish of our group- nicely breaded, good gravy, but could have used some salt. The Greek Omelet and Veggie omelets were both just okay, both were eaten with a hefty addition of hot sauce because they were bland. The hashbrowns and homefries were both nicely crispy, but had no seasoning of any sort. Pancakes did not get finished, very generic. Biscuits were done nicely, gravy was good... after adding a hefty shake of salt.   I would like to note that I do not normally add salt to my food at restaurants, I don't like salt, but the food here was not seasoned properly, or rather- at all.",

    "text": "They say, \"breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". I say, it's my favorite!  After a late night in Vegas, the first thing you want in your system the next morning is a hearty meal that hits home for you. Mr. Mama's did just that for us. We walked in to a spacious room filled with a staff that greeted us with all smiles. A view of the partially open kitchen can be seen from our table and it wasn't long before our server took care of our orders, going far and beyond with her service all throughout our meal. Thank you, Abby!   CHICKEN FRIED STEAK ($10.75) comes with 3 eggs your way, hash or home fries, and a side of carbs be it a sourdough toast or their fluffy pancake. I opted for the french toast for an extra $1.50 and it was money well spent. This meal alone can be shared between two people. Believe me when I say every part of this meal was fantastic! And that includes the hearty sausage gravy that topped the steak. Three of us ordered the same thing with different sides for variety and we were all impressed. Ideal sides for me would be two eggs sunny side up, one egg scrambled, hash browns, and their amazing pancake. Can I say, breakfast for champions?!   CHILI (12oz bowl $5.75) to share between everyone on the table was surprisingly delicious. Though I prefer eating this with their sourdough toast than the packaged crackers it came with. More kick please!  CALI OMELETTE ($8.50) was another delightful entree packed with melted cheddar cheese and sausage, then finally topped with pico de gallo, sour cream, and fresh cut avocado for that extra creamy factor. This was another generous plate that came with your choice of two sides. Can't go wrong with this.  Impressed yet? Here's more. For an already reasonable breakfast, they have a Yelp offer for $15 off $30 worth of food and a check-in offer with 1 free beverage of your choice. Hello, fresh OJ! This deal is simply unbeatable. We may have lost some at the casino but we sure walked out of here a winner. They close at 2PM so come early!",

I usually get the country fried steak and it has been juicy and crunchy each time. The gravy has good flavor to it unlike others that taste like paper mache paste.    Pancakes are nice and fluffy and my kid enjoys their French toast! And if you can get this kid to eat anything, well god bless you!  Lol.    Not much else to say about a breakfasts joint. Good food.

Surprisingly it was packed when we walked in and the hostess said it would be a 15 min. but we ended up waiting for less than 10 min. The hostess/manager was friendly and seated us by the window. We were curious as to the reason why it's named Mr. Mammas and she told us that previously it was a Greek restaurant, owned by a Greek owner who named the restaurant after a Greek Saint (hence the fact that the name is spelled w/o an apostrophe ['s]). Since the current owner is also Greek, he decided to keep the same name and create a logo that plays on the name (chef in a dress).    Our server, Jose, then came promptly and took our drink order. He was a good server, kept refilling our drinks, and even asked if we wanted any drinks to-go. We ordered the Reuben Sandwich with a side of chili--this is one of the best Reubens I've ever had, lots of corned beef and tons of flavor! The chili was pretty tasty too :P We also got the French Toast plate topped with fresh strawberries & whipped topping which was quite delightful! We usually share our entrees so we split them in half so we can have a taste of each. The portions are pretty decent and you usually get leftovers for a nice snack for later in the day! I've been here a couple of times before and the quality is always up to par. Will be back!",

I had home fries and scrambled eggs with it as well, and those were good but nothing too special. The cinnamon roll was excellent, nice and soft dough and a great sweet cinnamon flavor. Also, the service was A+! The servers were very attentive and the food was served very quickly. They were also super nice and friendly!

Their staff quickly and efficiently worked together to clean tables, serve food and ensure all the customers got what they needed. I got the veggie omelette and my bf got the mamma's small stack; we were impressed. I could tell that the veggies in my omelette were fresh and they added more compare to most breakfast places. The small stack had pancakes, eggs and a choice of bacon, sausage or ham. The pancakes were HUGE! Double the size and thickness of most pancakes (size of a plate). They were also very moist and flavorful. They didn't need much syrup or butter. I would definitely return to this place again.",

The service is amazing and they were very sweet. They checked up on us constantly and the wait for the food wasn't too long.  The food was amazing, I ordered the eggs Benedict with Ham with extra hollandaise sauce. Absolutely delicious, probably one of the best Egg Benedict's I've ever had. My order was a little complicated but the server was very understanding and compliant and there were no mistakes. I'd say the one thing issue I had was my French Toast and Potatoes were cold when I received them, but it was still so good! After we finished our meal, the owner went around and talked to us and other customers. He is such a nice guy, this place is amazing.   This place is great, the owner really knows how to treat his customers. From when we walked in until we walked out, the hospitality was on par. When I visit, I will most definitely visit again.",

We left Mr. Mamas feeling as though we got more than just our money's worth. The employees were very courteous, positive, and attentive. They have been trained well by the owner, whom we had the pleasure of meeting. Being of Greek origin, he radiated kindness and an overall \"we treat you like family\" kind of vibe. The food-while breakfast is a fairly simple meal to make, Mr. Mamas does it very well. Our chicken fried steak, veggie omelet, hash browns, home fries, and coffee came out piping hot and absolutely delicious. The attentive wait staff kept my coffee and water filled, as well as checked in to see how we were doing. If we could give this place 6 stars, we would. Until next year, Mr. Mamas....",

I ordered the Steak & Eggs breakfast with the same fixings as my Hubby... Perfect  That was the most tender steak I've had in quite some. Just delicious. I'm so thankful the food was good but beyond the food the customer service was excellent. It's so refreshing to find a place where customer service is a priority.

With stomachs growling, we were finally called and seated after a 45 minute wait. One of the best tips from the staff was, \"you should try the deep fried cinnamon roll\", man, it was the beginning of a phenomenal breakfast.  My husband had the chicken fried steak (a fave by locals) and I had one of the specials, sausage quesadilla (don't let the name fool you).  The quesadilla was packed with eggs, sausage, and all the yummy goodness was lovingly held together by pepper jack cheese. My husband's chicken fried steak was quite delicious, that gravy was just scrumptious. We both ordered well done hash browns, we were not disappointed.  The staff, they were working at a very fast pace but they always answer your raised hand for any request you may have. Don't worry about getting a snapshot of your food, Shawn takes care of that. He stands on a chair to guarantee a perfect picture of that meal.   Our Vegas visit will now include a trip to tuis awesome joint",

This is an off-the-strip gem that is frequented by both locals and out-of-towners (such as us).. you can tell by the number of taxis and ubers that were dropping folks off every five minutes.    LONG wait.. come early if you're doing a weekend breakfast.. and the big and bossy lady taking names at the front has a poor estimation of how long your wait will be.  Her sharp attitude which, on the one hand, appears to run a tight ship and keep things moving.. borders on rude.  In fact, she was getting to be so rude in my book that we almost left. She told us 20-30 min... (it seemed like her go to response on how long it would take).. it took an hour.  By the time it's 45 minutes.. you're like.. you've waited too long not to stay.  Not to judge a book by the cover.. but everyone seems like they may have had a prior criminal record with the amount of tattoos and tough guard appearance they seemed to carry.  If that is True, that's awesome this establishment provides second chances and I'd highly applaud it.  Aside from the \"Mama B-tch\" at the front with the clipboard.. everyone else.. ESPECIALLY Mr. Mama.. was fantastic.  He couldn't have been nicer and I appreciate an owner that does more than manage his business.. he pulls up his sleeves and buses tables so people can get in and eat.  He also goes around to ask how you're doing.. The staff earned this 4 star and the food was pretty daymn tasty.  Definitely would recommend this place.. just know the lady at the front is like a nasty guard dog you have to get past to enjoy the tasty treats within.  Overall.. I can see why this business has high reviews.  Homestyle cooking.. tasty and reasonably priced at vegas standards. We'd return and elect over the other options we've experienced in vegas.",

We arrived in 2 SUV's parked right on front and while walking towards the doors one opens and a friendly face greets us, \"come on in you look ready for breakfast\" (it was already lunch time, but he was not wrong) 8 of us, including a baby, experienced, as we entered a clean spacious vibrant place, friendly faces all over and the big fellow whom had great us walk us personally to our table, within seconds our waitress made herself available and coffees and OJ's started to appear. When asked about a good plate her answer was \"I am confident whichever you choose will be to your liking\" and she was right on the money! We all are coffee people and we all took the first sip, agreed that it was one of the best coffees we have ever had. The food? Well see for yourself too bad food aromas are not carried using yelp, yet! However you will have the opportunity to experience it personally. Highly recommended  Being a business owner, I am all about customer service, and I want to thank the Owner, yes he is the one who opened the door, escorted us to the table, came to check 2 times if everything was to our liking and even had time to chat with our littlest member of the family, our waitresses a mom and daughter team and busser where there and at the same time almost invisible except when needed, I learned about True customer service without all the fanfare and with lots of TLC from the whole staff. Thank You all and I will see you soon",

Instead of french fries or onion rings it would be nice to have been able to get a small salad or bowl of fruit upon leaving the restaurant everybody said goodbye and even opened the door for us. Very nice and friendly. I definitely want to come back for breakfast because their menu is incredible",

Mr. Mama opened the door and practically met us in the parking lot to tell us how happy he was to see us there. He then made some very friendly chit-chat. That was all well and good, but I was really there for the food.  I really enjoy a big breakfast, so my wife and I ordered enough food to get to $30 so we could use the $15 off $30. I had an omelette, bacon, eggs, coffee & OJ. While the portions were HUGE, and I almost ate it all, the food was a bit on the bland side. The maple syrup and salt saved the day, although the bacon was VERY tasty.    Would I repeat? Probably not since we found \"The Original Sunrise Cafe\" and ate there the next 2 days for breakfast :)",

The owner was within a couple of minutes from what he told me when I walked in. Great.   I ordered the corned beef hash which the kitchen turned around quickly, way too quickly. The CBH was mushy and undercooked (no crisp). The owner stopped by and asked me how was my meal. I shared the same feedback and he said that the kitchen was busy and he would give them a reminder to cook the hash better, Really? He could have offered to have my meal replaced. He could have comped the meal since he acknowledged the problem. Nada. And nada again to Mr. Mama.   As a fan of great corned beef hash, try EATS downtown for a real treat.",

I ordered the Mr. Mamas French toast and it was the best I've ever tasted. The perfect amount o cinnamon and powdered sugar in every bite. We also ordered the three meat omelet that had no crumbs left over and home fries that were perfection. I am not shocked that this location has a near perfect score because they truly are PERFECT!

We looked on Yelp and saw that Mr. Mamas was only 10-15 minutes from the strip, so after a 6 hour trip from LA, we got brunch here!  My goodness was the extra 15 minutes worth it! The food was so good, the portions were generous. I interviewed members of my family separately and everyone said \"delicious\"!  The customer service is what really put them on top though. There were 11 of us eating together, and the wait was not long at all. 15 minutes maybe? While we were waiting, the hostess kept us updated on the status of our table. When we got seated, we even had two servers! That's never happened before, and honestly, two servers for 11 people was pretty accommodating. I've been in a restaurant with a party of 15 and only one server. (Which is fine! Just to compare how awesome the customer service was here.) The service itself was very efficient too, even though all the tables inside were taken.  Overall, you will feel at home here, because of the staff and the atmosphere. Mr. Mamas himself introduced himself to us and even gave some customers his family background.",

I had pancakes with eggs and bacon. I like crispy bacon so my request to have the bacon burned. My waitress didn't even look at my crazy like most people, they actually have burnt bacon as an option. Love it. The pancakes were hard to pull apart when you cut them but they did fast good. My bacon was nice and crispy!  My husband had french toast which was absolutely delicious.

After finding out they would have to brew a new pot we declined the offer.  They  insisted. This is True custom service. The likes we don't see in California.

The home fries seemed to be a yelp favorite so I had to try them for myself.  I had the steak and eggs with home fries.   I am pleased to say that everything was worth the hype.  The steak was a rib eye cut and very tender and flavorful.  The prices are awesome.  So worth the drive across town.  A great place!",

The sausage gravy had a strong sausage flavor and chunks of sausage which I loved. I purchased the $15 for $30 deal here on yelp and used that. When I told the waitress I had it she explained the details to me and had no trouble redeeming it right off of my phone. It was definitely a deal worth buying. I'll be back soon to try more.",

To me it doesn't have to be Starbucks strong, but at the same time it should not look like it's watered down. 2 stars just because of the coffee.",

Not sure what happened this time but we will never return now. Sucks we thought we found a good breakfast place. 10/27/2016 :  Owner of the place called shortly after this review to assure me that is not how they work and they had someone training and should not have been left alone. So my husband told him thanks for the call, he offered to make it up to us. I knew they were good the first time I understand ppl have bad days and this place for sure has very good management and the staff does seem to try there hardest.",

It's located in a small shopping center. We got a parking stall right up front. As we approached the door, a friendly guy opened the door for us. He worked there and greeted us hello.   We got seated at a table. The kind waitress took our drink orders. I got an iced tea. I was debating on either getting breakfast or lunch. I wanted a burger, so I got the Mama's burger which is 1 pound of meat. It consisted of mushrooms, avocado, lettuce, tomato, bacon, red onions and I went with cheddar cheese. You get a choice of a type of cheese. I got French fries with my burger. It also came with a slice of dill pickle. I had to eat my burger with a knife and fork because it was too big to take a bite. Burger was juicy. Cheddar cheese was melted. Mushrooms were perfect. The bun was even buttered and toasted to perfection. One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas! The fries were cooked well. I truly enjoyed my burger. I had to give almost half of it to hubby.   Service was great! Waitress asked if I needed a refill on my iced tea. I was fine. I thought the waitress was a little forgetful because she gave my burger to my hubby. I had to tell her the burger was mine. She also thought my hubby had an iced tea when he ordered a Pepsi. I understand if she got busy tending to other customers. A waitress who waits on you should remember what you ordered. That's considered excellent skills! I had to dock a star for that.   Overall experience was good! Highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch!",

We were greeted by the Manager upon walking in who was swiftly and efficiently processing the guest waiting list in an engaging and friendly manner.  She told us 15-20 min and we were seated in 8 min. We were immediately served our beverages and order was taken in minutes. Our waitress came by at least 6 times to refill our coffee mugs. I had the eggs, bacon and home fries with the 50 cent upgrade of peppers and onions. The bacon was a nice thick cut and ample quantity of home fries. I'm gluten free so she immediately offered me sliced tomatoes in place of toast. Even with the wait we were in and out in 50 minutes. After paying our bill our waitress offered us a coffee to go which was a very pleasant and appreciated gesture!",

Service here is GREAT. Everyone here is sooooo attentive and friendly.   The food here is like your usual American diner food.  Hubby ordered French toast.. Came with 3 eggs and bacon... The French toast was light and fluffy. Looks like a lot, but easily killed... Egg is standard... I was surprised by the bacon though... Thick cut, nice and crispy... But had no flavor! No saltiness or anything. That was a first!   I ordered the chicken fried steak. And it was delicious! My meal came with a biscuit.. Everything was so heavy and dense, I skipped the biscuit (nice and buttered) and hash browns and just focused on the chicken fried steak and eggs. Again the eggs (over medium) is standard, with yummy runny yolk.. But the chicken fried steak was crunchy and flavorful.. Probably didn't even need any gravy! Yum! A generous portion too. I asked for the hash browns to be extra crispy. It was on the outside.. But the inside was a bit mushy...   Overall, an awesome place to go for a nice classic American breakfast with the BEST service.. Friendliness goes a long way..",

We were not just greeted at the door, but the door was opened for us and we were personally welcomed. I assume each group of four or so tables is assigned its own waiter/ess, as our waitress was with us instantly to recommend food options, take our orders, refill our coffee, and get our bill at the end. We didn't even have to ask for to-go cups of coffee at the end of our meal - she asked if we wanted them before we had a chance! Then, just as we stood up, the person busing tables asked if he could \"pre-bus\" our table for us. This is as efficient as a diner can be while remaining personal.  Not only was the service incredible, but the food was, of course, delicious. My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was described as a sausage gravy with a hint of maple and it did not disappoint! Incredible over thick pan biscuits. I had the French toast, which was also yummy. It came with a lot of food, so I didn't finish all of it. My only complaint would be that the coffee was a little watery, but it didn't distract from the meal as a whole.  Take the time to drive off the strip and enjoy an incredible diner experience!",

The options are far more than I have room to type, bottomless cups of hot coffee, and bigger than it needs to be portion size meals. What makes this place hum is the staff. Friendly with just the right amount of attitude. Get off the strip and find this place. You'll be happy you did.",

Jenna, the owner's daughter, was our server, and she was simply delightful. We asked her about the wrap on the menu named after her, and she told us the back story. Sean went around taking pics of folk and making us feel super welcomed. Overall, it was a great experience.",

I'd recommend a half order of biscuits and gravy and then a short stack of some quality pancakes. The chicken fried steak is awesome too if ya feel like some serious caloric splurging.  They offer lunch as well but I haven't got that far...serious can't get over the gravy. It's amazing. Thanks Mr Mama for being a solid establishment. :)",

Yea it's just a typical breakfast/brunch set up but the food was really good. Chicken fried steak was plate licking good. Hash browns were delicious like actually seasoned and fresh. Somehow the eggs were creamy? In a good way I don't know how to explain it, even the toast was better than average. Not sure what they put in their food but it gets ppl hooked because the line is usually out the door. The service was above and beyond, super friendly and accommodating, funny when u see them tuff looking guys with tattoos but just great customer service. I guess the only dislike was the cinnamon bun, maybe I was expecting cinnabuns lol but wasn't bad. Home fries were ok, I'd stick with hash browns u won't be disappointed. I'd say all the savory foods were amazing and the sweet stuff (French toast, cinnamon roll) were alright. Coffee is good too. Just try it you'll see...",

We happened to just walk in here on a whim, and like everyone says, we were greeted at the door with a smile and a genuine greeting.  Our server was incredibly helpful, even advising that we might be ordering too much food, as their servings were big.  The food was prepared quickly and was delicious!  The wrap I got (Marty Wrap?) was HUGE and absolutely delicious.  Everything else we got was amazing.  During our meal, the same guy that greeted us at the door stopped by to see if everything was ok.  The prices are very reasonable.  We felt like we had made a GREAT choice.  At our departure, the same guy - must be the owner - opened the door for us and thanked us, and invited us back again.  One other thing, you can really see the 100% real customer service that all the employees feel.  When walking guests to their tables, the servers didn't just seat them and give them menus, there was conversation, eye contact, real caring.  That's rare these days.  10 thumbs up and 50 stars to this place.  I'll be back and will be happy to tell everyone I know about Mr Mamas.",

I had the pancakes combo with eggs and bacon, plus sides of grits and hash browns, plus OJ and coffee. The best parts of the meal were the coffee and pancakes, the rest was very lackluster. I ordered less cooked bacon and received hard-as-a-rock bacon that was noticeably overcooked. The butter they gave me for the grits was fake butter (margarine made of vegetable oil). The eggs were ordered over medium but came out quite undercooked. The service was excellent, however. We received an enthusiastic fist-pump on the way out the door with a 'thanks brother for coming'. Not sure if others like this, but I found it to be an awkward way to thank someone for their patronage. Prices were decent. I hope others find this review helpful.",

The first thing that stood out to me about this establishment was that the owner was at the door greeting guests as they walked in.  The owner also asked if you enjoyed your food, and wanted sincere feedback.  Even though the waiting area and the restaurant was small, he made sure everyone was accommodated quickly.  The owner kept in contact with all guests and communicated to them how long it would be before their table was ready.  Without a doubt, the food was great - My wife is extremely picky and had only good things to say about the food, service and the restaurant.  All of the servers were great and very courteous as well.  Make sure you visit for breakfast when in Vegas or if you are a local and don't know about it, you must try it!",

There's just something missing from them, maybe salt? Staff was friendly except for the tattooed host that would occasionally bully them.",

Ordering: ordered 1/2 order of biscuit and gravy, she asked if I wanted a sample (which I thought was weird but I said yes because it was made with maple) tasted it and it was pleasantly different.   Food: came quickly and was delicious, ordered a side of bacon and was surprise how it was perfectly cooked to how I liked it. ( not over cooked not under cooked and still juicy). Pancakes were amazingly good, fluffy and sweet.  Service: she was very friendly and nice, never got irritated and never over asked.   Overall: a great place for breakfast on the way to Vegas.

It was our first time there and the line was crazy. We almost left, however, I insisted on waiting. Before we knew it we were next!!! Do not be insulted by the name yelling it is a small lot so people tend to stray while waiting. I always get french toast and this ocassion was no different. We also decided to get the chicken fried steak with their gravy and homestyle potatoes. Let me just tell you.... WOW!!! The gravy is amazing and the chicken was amazingly crispy!!! That is definitely something you don't get often!!! The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and paired deliciously with the eggs (scrambled). I was sad that I had to ask for butter on my french toast since usually it is melted on top. I waited a while so they were cold so unfortunately I did not get the best flavor, but they were still delicious. Cannot wait to try more things on the menu!!!!",

Their food is AMAZING I personally loved the chicken fried steak with the gravy~ Also their portion size is pretty large and it's well priced too! And to top it all off their service is amazing, and there was even a guy at the door making sure he was telling each customer that was leaving that he appreciates their business. The guy definitely put a smile to my face lol. I wish my family and I could come back here. This place has great food, great prices, and great/fast service, I honestly don't know what more you could ask for!",

    "text": "I used to go to Mr. Mama's old loaction on Decatur, but I must say that this is far better. The old location was, in a way, hidden from the masses, which kind of made it more secretive to loyal followers. This location is now out in the open. Mr. Mamma's has new tables, chairs, and a far larger location, which makes it far better than their last location.  I was very happy to see that there wasn't a change to their menu. I ordered the Cali omelette, which I've ordered in the past, and was not disappointed. The only thing I did differently, was had them add bacon to the omelette, which was only a $1.75 extra charge. If you want an actual side of bacon, with four strips, it's an additional $3.50. I paid $8.50 for my omelette with the old style hashbrowns, and a side of sour dough bread (you pick your bread). I also had iced coffee, which was $2.50 with unlimited refils.   My friend ordered the French Toast and 4 strips of bacon. I felt bad for him, because my meal looked superior to his. He really enjoyed what he had though.   Our waitress, Melissa, was excellent. She was very attentative and extremely nice. The owner is great, as well. He came over and talked to us for a minute and answered any question we had.   This location is now around the corner from my house. I have a feeling I won't be going to many other places because of this. All my friends can be happy to know they have an amazing breakfast spot to indulge at when they come into town.",

I have no idea where I got that notion from. Nothing could have been further from the truth. This place is a sit-in all-American sort of breakfast place and reminds me a lot of Eggworks on a smaller scale. That does not mean their food is any less delicious, though!   My friend and I walked in at around 1 PM on a Sunday, and there were two or three couples ahead of us. The host told us there'd be a 15-minute wait time, but got us to our table after barely five minutes had passed. Under-promise, over-deliver, right?  I got Mama's Breakfast Burrito with ham and the chunky salsa sauce, and it was great. It was admittedly a bit on the smaller side, but the ingredients and ham in it were so filling that I was full by the time I finished it.    Our server was quick and attentive throughout our meal, as she kept our drinks refilled and checked up on us regularly.   Overall, great service, great food, and close to my house. I will be back.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been at Mr Mammas many times, we always were greeted by the owner when we went he was always so nice. Today 10/13/15 our stay was not good. First, it started with the waitress Claudia. We had to wait for a long time for our coffees and waters. We also waited a long time to place our food order. When we finally received our food , I found a small bone in my ham. My wife did not receive her toast she ordered, also  I did not receive the red peppers and onions on my home fries, I told the waitress she brings them in a small dish. She told me the cook didn't put them on. We asked for the owner to come over, so we could mention what went wrong. All he did was apologized two times. He didn't say anything else, like what can I do for you folks? For your bad service. When we said more about the bad service, the owner took our check and walked away with a attitude and said l'll take care of your check. It did seem to us that the owner didn't like to hear complaints. It showed us he is a very phony owner. In the past, he was a very friendly owner. Today, he showed us he has a attitude and doesn't care about his customers. We have been coming here a long time and now we know what the owner is all about. The owner , also should spend less time talking to customers and start caring about customers concerns. Or maybe walk around with coffee. Our experience was so bad, we will not be going back!",

The reviews and pictures said it all and our decision was easily made to check it out.   When we arrived there were groups of people waiting to be seated. Our wait time was 20 minutes but it ended up being 10. Staff is great at keeping you informed when they're preparing your table.   The hardest part was trying to figure out what to order especially when you're Hangry everything sounds good!   I ordered the veggie omelette + cheddar/jack cheese (extra). This comes with hash browns, toast, and fruit all for only $9.95. I also ordered a side of bacon Everything was great! Portion size was huge I couldn't finish my plate.   We shared the half size biscuits n sausage gravy to try out ($5.95) The gravy was creamy and delicious and the biscuits warm and fluffy.   Mr. Mama himself is the man coming around greeting each table and kindly checking on customers making sure all is good. That goes to show how much they care about customer satisfaction.   Overall the entire staff is great and always checking on you. I really enjoyed the food here and would definitely return!",

She made the most motivational comments and was just an uplifting positive person.  The owner/manager?  talked to us a few times and was very friendly.

Even the manager Kat came over and welcomed me and helped me with my decision. She hooked me up and let me know to substitute regular toast for a pancakes (but I got sourdough as well). The fresh orange juice is just right not too sweet and delightful.  I was amazed at how fast my order came out. The Cali omelette is full of flavor and the sour cream with Pico was a perfect mix. Portions are solid. My omelette was four egg and the perfect amount, I was pretty hungry and it filled me up!  Great people great food give them a try you will be happy you did!!!",

    "text": "OMG!  You will not believe the experience I just had at MR.MAMAS !  From the time you step to the front door you are greeted with a warm and inviting smile. Seated Swiftly, greeted again by another team member. Drink order was taken immediately. Greeted again by another amazing staff member.  The menu is just right!  I ordered The Mama's French toast with scrambled eggs and cheese with bacon and a side of grits. (Wait until I tell you about these grits)  The French toast you can taste the cinnamon sprinkled on top... Fluffy. Mmmmmmmm Not a fan of eggs, however they were also fluffy and tasty with the perfect amount of cheese.  NOW THESE GRITS! My Mama (get it) lol. In my opinion makes the best grits to man kind. She's in NYC. Second from her grit is Mike from The Home of Chicken and Waffles in the Bay area. Now Mr.Mamas is added to the list. I love my grits with a little lump and airy. Mr.Mamas grits is life.  My Husband ordered Mr.Mamas pancakes. The pancakes was the size of your head. For the first time in history my husband was not able to finish his food. I was so happy that he met his match.  The pancakes by the way fluffy and the syrup soaks into the pancake....so tasty.  Looking around the the restaurant, everything is so clean, organized in place the equipment look brand new out the box but it's not. I was in HEAVEN! For me to be such a foodie and dine out a lot I never truly feel comfortable and safe eating food from others maybe it's the inspector in me   Oh yeah! A really awesome employee took a really great picture of us at the table with our food from a great angle...thanks buddy  Our server Eileen, sweet as pie, very nice not over baring....just perfect  I also noticed that all the staff is happy with each other, helpful like a team and having a good time being at work. Great Atmosphere  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.MAMA. GREAT GUY. FEELS LIKE THAT FAVORITE UNCLE WHO YOU CALL TO GET YIU OUT OF TROUBLE WITH OUT JUDGING YOU BUT WILL GIVE YOU A STERN LECTURE AND HUG YOU AFTER.  Maria the Manager. (Bad with names) so nice, with a great smile.. God Bless you!  At the end of my experience. I felt I was leaving really close family members and I don't want to go. I was left wondering how can I franchise and put this restaurant next door to my house.  MR.MAMAS IS DEFINITELY 5 STAR ALL THE WAY!  I ALMOST FORGOT! HOW CLEAN TO CONDIMENT BOTTLES ARE! IM A STICKLER FOR BOTTLES THAT HAVE GUNK ON THEM. THESE BOTTLES WERE SPARKLING CLEAN AND I LOVE THAT THEY OFFER DELI MUSTARD, IT'S MY FAVORITE. (NO I didn't need it for my meal, but I did taste it just because)",

The food was made in a good amount of time and served in large portions. I couldn't finish it all.   I was pleasantly surprised by the involvement of the owner (Mr. Mama) in the dining experience and overall satisfaction of the customers. He greeted everyone and even engaged in a few conversations. I will definitely visit again. If personal service with a positive attitude is what you seek in a dining experience, I urge you to give Mr. Mamas a try.",

There was a small wait but wasn't more then a few minutes with a larger party in front of Us exceeded our expectations. Once we were seated we ordered a little bit of everything on the breakfast side. We had the Cali omelet which was moist and perfectly done. We also ordered the biscuits and gravy which has some bacon in there with the sausage and was excellent. The egg Benedict had perfectly poached eggs that accompanied the hollandaise sauce which I couldn't get enough of. The potatoes with peppers and onion on the side were a excellent accompaniment. We will definitely be back next time we are in town and not only cause of the wonderful service but we want to try more off the menu. Thank you again till next time.",

The restaurant is clean and inviting with comfortable chairs and well kept tables. The menu had a good selection of breakfast choices.   I ordered french toast with bacon and my boyfriend ordered the California omelet. The food came very quickly and looked amazing. The omelet had large slices of avocado on top with sour cream and pico de gallo. My french toast was golden and fluffy with cinnamon sprinkled on as it cooked  (I assume) & dusted with the perfect amount of powdered sugar. The bacon was the thick cut kind which was surprising  because most places cheap out with the super thin bacon.   The owner was also extremely nice. There was a couple from out of town that had located the restaurant online and thought to give something off the strip a try. The owner took the time to recommend some excellent things to do while they were in town. I thought it was great how he makes everyone feel so welcome and takes the time to make sure everything is perfect with your meal.   Good food, good service, good price, can't beat that.",

Sadly though, as has become the trend, the food here was pretty mediocre.  Certainly not the worst food ive ever had, but it's not the life changing expirencing most people seem to be having.  The biscuits and gravey tasted like they were comprised of 2% milk, flour, and jimmy dean bacon sausage, with a dusting of black pepper and no salt for miles.  My friend had the chilli cheese fries, and commented that it tasted like Ragu from a can with ground beef.  No traditional seasoning and it was \"from a jar\" bright red.  Setting aside the food, the space is arranged nicely.  Tables are positioned in such a way as make it feel like youve got a nice amount of room to enjoy your meal.  The service was fast and attentive, which is a nice change from the usual off strip dining expirences we've had this far.  All in all, sadly just not worth getting out of bed for.",

Was going by to order the chili/cheese burger but upon ordering her homemade corned beef hash, our server commented that that was a very good choice and her favorite dish. Once I heard that I ordered the same thing. Their corned beef is actually homemade and one of the best I've ever had. Free refills for coffee and hot tea are available. Props to Lourdes for the awesome, sincere, and genuine service provided to us. If you are in the mood for a great breakfast at very reasonable prices visit Mr Mamas; you won't be disappointed.",

We saw pancakes come out of the kitchen that looked amazing! Portions are nice size .. Hard to eat it all ... The gravy is different and they offer to let you try it before getting it and wow was it good! Sausage..bacon...so very tasty. Ask for Tamara ! She was fabulous!

From the moment we walked in we were impressed, we could tell the place was ran with the deliberate intention to provide exceptional excellent customer service.  We notice the bus boys clearing and clean the tables and chairs, then looking all around making sure the space around was clean.  The hostess was interacting with the customers. The servers were waiting for plates to be ready.  When were seated the waitress, Jenna, was knowledgeable, friendly and very quick to keep our beverages full.  She was attentive without being annoying. We had decided even if the food was only ok we were happy. But the food was delicious! Best meal we had the entire weekend!",

    "text": "To be honest, I am completely baffled at how this place has a 5 star rating from so many reviewers. A friend was coming into town and wanted breakfast with us so I suggested this place because of the ratings, they were so good! My expectations were high, and what we experienced was very poor.   Upon walk-in, our friends were already seated but we weren't allowed to sit next to them or put any tables together because there was no room, even though we were willing to wait to put our tables together. That was not going to happen & we ended up sitting there, waiting for a table while our friends got theirs. I told the host that it was okay, although honestly it was an inconvenience. Once we were seated, opposite of our friends' table, his parents decided to take our table so that we could sit with our friends.   Our server was Julia, who seemed rushed. I understand, there's a lot of people waiting to be seated; I saw several customers waiting outside as well, but we are the ones seated, we shouldn't be rushed; we waited our turn just as they are waiting theirs. Once we ordered our food, it came back to us in a fairly good time. I ordered steak & eggs with hashbrowns and so did my boyfriend. Unfortunately my plate had my steak & eggs but it had thinly cut potatoe wedges/fries and I told her I asked for hashbrowns, she assumed my boyfriend asked for the thin cut wedges and told us to swap our steaks. She literally told us to swap our steaks. We had different eggs too, why would we swap plates????  My boyfriend said he ordered hashbrowns too so she left to get a separate plate of hashbrowns and said that now we could have both. (Although I didn't touch a single potato wedge thing.)  She frequently checked in on us.... A little too frequently to the point where again, it made us feel rushed. She spoke quickly, came and went quickly, and came too much.   The food here was mediocre in comparison to other breakfast places. I have had better steak and eggs & I honestly don't plan on coming back here again. It's not terrible, but I didn't have a very nice experience and the food wasn't all that great either.",

The host was on top of things , got us on the wait list and sat within the time given The server was on point made sure any questions were answered . We got a pancake and a cinnamon roll for the table we shared between 4 people and it was so good. The pancake was delicious I ate it without syrup and it was perfect the syrup took it to her next level of goodness . The cinnamon roll had us wanting more!  We had eggs Benedict, chicken fried steak and steak and eggs and no one had anything but excellent things to say about their food . The home fries and hash browns I definitely recommend getting the bell peppers to go on it it takes it up a notch for sure!   The place was clean the food didn't take too long to come out and the service was great . Definitely bookmarked for future trips !",

We looked at the menu and new it was a perfect fit... the service was perfect everyone was engaged in making the experience welcoming. From the door being opened when we arrived. Good morning with meaning was said. Our table was ready right away.  Jasmine was our waitress... we ordered steak and eggs with tater tots and then an  omelette with mushroom, spinach, pepper jack with a side of avocado and their wonderful salsa ... the coffee was fresh the orange juice delicious. Places like this are so special because they hold True to older values of making the customer feeling welcome and then serving them quality food at a great price. Great food !!! Great prices but the friendly environment is what truly makes this place extra special. Thank you Mr Mamas",

We decided on Mr Mamas based on reviews.   The staff was so nice and very hard working.  My husband got a turkey club and ask our waitress what bread she would pick for the sandwich. She said the hamburger bun.  ( Really a hamburger bun?) I got a chili burger.  The hamburger buns were SO good. We loved both of our lunches.   This place is a good choice and affordable.",

    "text": "Prologue: A co-worker of mine recommended this restaurant during a recent discussion of favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. My fiancee and I had originally decided to try someplace new in Chinatown for breakfast. However, our experience in Chinatown at dinner time on the day before was less satisfying and so we opted to visit this restaurant for our Sunday brunch.  The Plot: We shared two entrees, which included Mamas Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs (with eggs over easy) and a Cali Omelet (with peppers, mushrooms, and onions added).  We also ordered a Buttermilk Pancake because I had been told they were very good and so we just had to try one.  The Scene: The portion sizes for both entrees were very generous and more than enough for both of us. Each entree also came with potatoes and toast to order.  My fiancee absolutely loved the omelet and all of the sides. It was made with four eggs, which were cooked perfectly, so the omelet was large enough to hold all of the cheese and veggies without anything spilling out.  The eggs that were served with the chicken fried steak were the best example of over easy that I have experienced as long as I can remember. The steak was very tender and flavorful.  The Rest of the Story: The service was courteous and very friendly. The host went out of his way to help us take a selfie. The wait was reasonable for a Sunday busy morning and the prices were average.  Epilogue: My fiancee has decided that this will now be our regular breakfast spot when visiting Las Vegas.

I have to tell you-even though my tummy was growling--it was WELL worth the wait!  The staff was super friendly right front the start!  They seated us, gave us info on any of the dishes we asked about and the food came our fairly quick!  The staff came and checked on us while waiting on our food as well as after the food came out.  They seemed to go around joking with all the tables too!  Best comment ever was when the manager (who is bald) went up to a customer eating (also bald) and said \"Hey man, you have a nice looking head\" ROFL--my cousin and I laughed so hard--then my cousin even asked him \"why didn't you tell me I had a nice head?\"  --his reply, with a serious face \"you have too much hair covering yours up\"  hahahahahaha!    The food was amazing and pretty big portions!  I got the french toast, eggs and bacon. I was not a fan of the eggs as they had a weird taste to them, but everything else was spot on!  My cousin devoured her eggs Benedict saying it was amazing!!    I would highly recommend you check this place out when you are in Vegas next!  The food, staff and pricing was top notch!",

The service was prompt and friendly.   Cinnamon roll - was excited to try this based on reviews, but I have to say I wish I skipped it. The roll itself is quite dry, and as it sat it only got more dry. Don't recommend getting this.   Breakfast burrito - large portion, full of eggs and meat and hash browns. Yum!  Eggs and toast - a perfect portion for someone who doesn't have a huge appetite. Comes with crispy hash browns (or home fries). My over easy eggs were perfect, and the toast was crisp and buttered.   Overall, definitely stop by for a hearty American diner breakfast, but skip the cinnamon roll!",

I'm a huge fan of Eggs Benedict, so when I saw that Mr.Mamas offers this on their menu I decided to go check it out. Best decision I have ever made! The food, the service, the atmosphere was just great! Our hostess was so sweet and very attentive in making sure we knew how much longer we had left to wait. They really do try to get the line moving as fast as possible as this is a popular spot and the wait can become very long. Once we where seated, the staff made sure to ask us if we where having a good time and if we needed anything. They where all so lovely. Best customer service I have experienced in a while. Food was great and tasty. Definitely recommend anyone to make a stop here if they can. Will be making this one of my spots to visit every time I'm here.",

I have never had a breakfast spot this amazing (well only 808 grindz in Hawaii).   I ordered the eggs Benedict with the eggs a little over easy. I highly recommend the eggs Benedict if you are a fan. The hash brown came out nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. To top it off, it was perfectly seasoned.   Service - the staff is very accommodating and polite. When you walk in they greet you with a smile and are more than happy to help.   If you're in Vegas, come here!!",

Beware ..the white gravy is dotted w/ bacon & sausage.  Loved it! Wife had biscuits & gravy..biscuits were toasted on one side that gave it more texture. Son had pancakes & sausage..giant stack of 4 pancakes.. eggs & 2 sausage patties. The other manager cane by & checked on our food. In and out within 40 minutes & beat the Sunday breakfast rush.

It would have been nice if there was a kids menu but the home fries, orange and a side of avocado was a good option.",

French toast, country fried steak and my omelet were good. The home fries, steak and eggs, corn beef hash and pancakes didn't make the grade. The steak wasn't seasoned well, the pancakes were chewy and corn beef hash was to salty. Lastly the manager reprimanded an employee on the floor in front of many customers, not good.  I wouldn't say not to go but I would ask questions about how they prepare their food...make your own decision",

Jose was an efficient server together with their entire team they all worked together to serve all customers in a prompt efficient manner. There was so many great choices on their breakfast menu there is something for everyone to enjoy. I would recommend this off the stripe breakfast or lunch restaurant as a must at least once. Great prices, good ambiance, delicious food and outstanding efficient customer service tops the charts. Try their buttermilk pancakes made with sweet cream and a few berries. Oatmeal topped with a wee bit of cinnamon and a few berries on top just to name a few. Thanks again for a wonderful memorable experience",

It's usually pretty busy every time I've gone and as busy as it is someone (usually an employee) manages to open the door upon your arrival which is so pleasant especially when you're hungry. I was a little hesitant to wait cause it was SO busy but they hustle. Not like they are rushing people out but as soon as a table opens up it is cleaned right away and ready to be occupied. As for the food, it was fast and yummie!",

The waitresses and waiters are all very attentive even on a busy morning like that one. This place definitely has that diner feel. I'm not in love with the setup, just a bunch of low sitting tables all spread out. No booths or dividing walls.   Food:  I ordered an egg white omelette with added chicken, avocado, and spinach with side of fruit. Omelette cooked perfectly. Great taste.  I also ordered a short stack of pancakes as well. The pancakes were fluffy and great taste. I have a big sweet tooth for breakfast - I didn't see much for options with their pancakes or French toast.   If this place had more sweet options, I would have given it a five. I should have ordered the cinnamon roll... Next time I come in I will.   Overall a great experience. I can see why locals come here for breakfast.",

You have to loved a guy who comes to your table to thank you for coming to eat at his restaurant, really makes you feel at home and welcome.   Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with their homemade sausage gravy and a biscuit instead of toast. You have to bring a good appetite to polish off this order. Great gravy with a little kick, the Chicken Fried Steak was crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside.  I finally can take Mr. Mama's off my LV Bookmark Brekkie list,I'm happy that I drove all the way here. Hey you have to support local businesses that have this kind of passion.

Although the wait time (@ 11:30 on a Sunday morning) was 45 minutes, the casual, easygoing atmosphere, superb service and delectable menu items laid to rest the original apprehension to bolt for a less crowded establishment - this place definitely optimizes the term \"all good things to those who wait.\"  Our eight strong and very hungry party was completely satisfied with the service, food choices and tastiness of the food! Yes, Mr. Mama's serves mainly breakfast and brunch items, but everyone was thoroughly satiated with the gratifying bill of fare.   Wade your way through the local populace, place your name on the wait list and be prepared to indulge in a tiny slice of breakfast and brunch heaven. If you are not already on this list, you are definitely missing out!",

We both ordered omelettes, hashbrowns, toast and my friend ordered an extra side of biscuits and gravy with his. The only downside is that we didn't care for their country gravy, it was really plain and dry tasting, unfortunately. Otherwise the food was delicious! My chili omelette was really good! The chili was perfect, not too spicy, served fresh and it had a delicious taste to it. The hashbrowns were amazing, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sourdough toast was big, soft & fluffy. The coffee was hot, fresh and good---i enjoyed mine with some French vanilla creamer and sugar. Yum! The staff and service was fast, friendly and awesome. Our wait time for food was just about 10 minutes total. Finally, the prices are very reasonable. In my opinion, it was well worth the $12 Uber ride from the strip to receive a quality breakfast and reasonably priced breakfast. On the strip you'll pay $5 just for a single cup of coffee! I will definitely be back again in the future!",

The southern gravy has the goldilocks stick to your ribs thickness, a hint of sweetness and generous chunks of sausage.  Hash browns cooked with butter (I presume), 3 eggs and a flakey biscuit really rounded out the meal.  The servers were attentive and the food was delivered quickly.

You can tell they have a good work environment and great rapport with their customers and each other!   Next time I come back, I will be ordering the eggs Benedict and time after that I will get house hash, and then after that I will get the biscuits and gravy (they offer if you want to sample the gravy).

Let me go on, and on, and on. They are thick yet light and ya know how thick pancakes fall apart and become moosh as soon as the syrup hits them? Yah, these don't! They are delicious and HUGE! Also, you gotta try the sausage gravy! They make it with sausage AND bacon with a touch of maple syrup! I could actually eat cauliflower if it had that heavy on it!  Staff was amazing (Hi Kat!), I had never been there yet I felt as though we were regulars! I will definitely make a point to come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

Sometimes it can get a little busy but I assure you it is worth the wait the food is incredible. The food is always fresh, never heavy, never greasy. But beware if you don't like your picture taken because one of the managers comes around and tries to take your picture while you're eating, obviously you can say no, but just a heads up. I recommend the breakfast burrito it is A+++!",

From walking in, the gentleman seating us already makes you feel as if you're one of the family.  The continued greatness is felt throughout the meal and you're walking out the door.    The meal here was good.  I had ordered the Mama's Sandwich which is loaded with turkey, bacon, avocado and pepper jack cheese.   The bread is wonderfully toasted to hold in all of the goodness. The French fries were ok but somewhat under done.  It was unfortunate.  I know I will definitely be back to try their breakfast items.    This new location is much bigger than their previous spot.  Different location but same great service.  See you again soon!",

The owner is right there at the front door greeting customers as they walk in. He also walks around to every table to ensure everything is superb. The servers go out of their way to make you happy and always have a smile on their face.   As for the food, DELICIOUS! We have tried almost everything from the menu. Corned beef hash, French toast, breakfast wrap, burger, salad...and nothing has disappointed us. My favorite thing on their menu has to be their hash browns. I always get them well done. They are crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. So so good. Their coffee is also good and smooth. Portions and pricing are right.   Like I said, if you are looking for a solid breakfast joint with good service, this is definitely the spot.",

Usually, I stick to omelettes as, I am not much of a breakfast eater. However, the wait staff \"hyped up\" the Country Fried Steak and it was just gross. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but, it tasted like grounded scrapple. You know?! That southern delicacy... And I just wasn't expecting it in Las Vegas, which is definitely not the South! The only thing I enjoyed was the lemonade and the \"Home Fries\" which are basically diced potatoes. I opted for $2 extra to add peppers. And it was decent. I will say that the price range was very good. I just wished that the food was as well. The wait staffed on 11/21 just seemed gloomy for a Monday. Overall, I wouldn't come back. Try Cracker Barrel.",

I was only able to eat two or three bites and couldn't eat anymore. It was way too sweet but good.   Next, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns. The biscuits were delicious. It was warm and toasty and the gravy wasn't too bad either. The biscuits are cooked in-house and you can taste the difference from the store bought ones. The hash browns are the best here. Nice and crispy in every bite. Love it.   It was a little bit off the strip but I would come back again. However, you must come early this place gets pack real fast.",

The food was just as amazing and cooked with love. All of us enjoyed our food from pancakes, omelette, home fried potatoes and now my fav steak and eggs. So good we came back 2 days later!!! This place is definitely a gem and will tell all my folks to patronize this awesome place when in Vegas.",

As we drove up to the place we noticed quite a few people waiting outside so we figured it would be good. On Yelp have it 4 1/2 stars. We had the best breakfast ever. The food was fresh I had the corned beef hash with hash browns and eggs and my sister had chicken fried steak; my mother had French toast and my husband had bacon hash browns toast and eggs. Everything was so good. The service was fast and the staff were very friendly and attentive. The owner came by to see how everything was and he was really nice and friendly. I will definitely stop by again if I'm in Las Vegas. I recommend it to everyone and anyone",

I instantly added them to my elite list of Top 5 favorite breakfast experiences. I'm a Midwest girl and we love our big portions. I've never had so much food before!! The pancakes are bigger than the size of my head. And . .the waitress let us substitute the toast that comes with the meal for one pancake. What??! No one has ever let me do that! No up charge I asked. . . with a smile the server answered to my surprise \"no\". And . . . You can order one pancake or one piece of French toast if you want.  I had chicken fried steak- bigger than my face too - with some of the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted! And that's saying a lot because my parents are from the South and I've had my share of gravy.  The food was great but so was the service! From the time we walked in the door to the steps we took leaving, the hostess and wait staff was very attentive to our every need. My husband's coffee cup was never empty, my soda was strong and always topped off.  Just simply amazing! We are big fans and will always visit Mr. Mamas for a great meal!",

I'd never say it's the best X, Y, or Z of anything I had eaten, but it's somewhere where I would return repeatedly because the food is just solid.  Their potatoes, whether they be home fries or hashbrowns, are on point.  Damn good taters.  Awesome service and they have the restaurant running like a machine.

We got seated immediately and of course I order my biscuits and gravy. They ARE different here because the gravy is very delicious because it has big chunks of sausage. Now mind you Shawn is always making sure you don't need anything.  Now after you're done with your coffee, biscuits and gravy,  eggs, bacon and pancakes you pay your bill which came out to $26. Pretty good deal when you and your husband eat a savory   breakfast in Vegas. Then Shawn of course bids you farewell and pleasant travels back home. We will definitely make this spot a definite stop when we're back in Vegas!!!!!! Thank you Shawn and Mr. MAMAS for a wonderful ending to my birthday weekend.",

Immediately after we walked in to the restaurant we were greeted by a very happy and welcoming gentlemen who walked us to our table. He was genuinely happy and made us feel extremely welcomed and special. In a restaurant that was almost completely full he did seem rushed or frazzled which was a pleasant feeling. He introduced us to our waitress and the service was amazing from start to finish.  Food was like any other breakfast place. Nothing special or spectacular about the menu. I'm not very picky about coffee but I do like having the option of having flavored creamers (like how many other breakfast places have) and this restaurant does not offer flavored creamers. I prefer eggworks or Baby Stacks, but have to commend this place for its amazing customer service.",

One thing that jumped at me was that there was a good variety of people from different nationalities, so you know its a good place to eat if it is able to attract different tastes.  The food was good but the french toast was even better. The service was great, real friendly and it seemed that they really work well as a team helping each other out by serving their customers from taking orders, refilling drinks, cleaning up plates, etc. Our server, Jen I believe, was really nice and knowledgeable about the food they serve, which was helpful when making a decision to order. The place is clean and I was surprised that the syrup container was not sticky at all, it was fairly clean. I feel the price I paid was worth it and if and when I come back to Vegas, I will most definitely come back to Mr. Mammas, regardless if my hotel serves breakfast.",

Wow, the service is impeccable.  The kind gentlemen open the door to welcome us and quickly ask if we need a high chair and right when I said yes, he motioned for his team to set up the high chair so by the time we got to our table, there is the high chair.  Then as we are looking at the menu, the manager swung by and chit chatted with us, told us about the menu.  Very friendly.    Our waitress energy was a bit down, but she got our order right.  I got the corned beef hash with hash browns and sour dough toast.  Everything was good except for the toast, it was a more on the burnt side (I looked over at the neighboring table and their toast was perfectly golden brown vs. dark brown like mine).  The hash browns was the star...I finished it.   I give this place 4.5 Star.",

Talks to each table, inspects the cleanliness at all times, and even cleans up himself in order for his staff to focus only on the customer service, I assume.",

    "text": "First, I called the number of Mr. Mamas listed on Yelp on a Sunday morning to find out how long of wait it was.  There was no answer so I figured it was busy.  In about a minute, I got a call from Mr. Mamas asking  if I had called and what it was I needed.  I asked how long of a wait it was and he said that there were two tables left open right but we can sit you in about 30 minutes or less if they are filled up.  I definitely did not expect a call back.  That was awesome.  As for the food, my wife had the corned beef hash and eggs.  The hash was not mixed with anything other than corned beef and potatoes and this is just the way we like it.  No crazy onions or peppers.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  The gravy was a little thick but really good.  If you don't like too much gravy, I would ask for it on the side.  The Chicken Fried Steak was excellent.  It wasn't full of breading and you could taste the meat.  Yum.  Best part about this place is how \"on-point\" they are about keeping the tables turning.  Once a family is done with their meal, they open the door for them on the way out and they are right on it, cleaning it up and getting it ready for the next family.  It is a testament to his initial introduction \" We can sit you in about 30 minutes or less if they (tables) are filled up.\"",

This place is in a strip mall so plenty of parking. The sign has two burly guys dresses cooks but do not be frightened! They can cook! I went with the strawberry pancakes-strawberries inside and on top. Husband got the strawberry French toast. We shared hash browns with onions and peppers. As if this meal couldn't get any better, they offered flavored creamer for their delicious coffee. The bacon was crisp and not fatty. He got his eggs the way he liked them, soft scrambled, which doesn't happen often.   There was no reason not to wait! You will not be disappointed. Service was fast and the food was hot. The host was friendly and well as the wait staff. Even if we do not stay at that hotel again we will come back if in the area.",

This place deserves a million stars. I cant say enough good things about this restaurant. First off when you walk in it is a typical ma and pop type restaurant feel. (At least thats the feeling i got). The hostess always greets you with a smile and anyone near by also greets you! If you are lucky you are seated right away. If not, your name goes on a list and you wait your turn for the plate of gold also known as their food!!! EVERY time i have gone into Mr Mama's, i have had AMAZING service and even better food!  I have more than one favorite... so it is hard to pick the best. The chicken fried steak is.... beyond perfect. SERIOUSLY, please do yourself a favor and put some of that heavenly goodness into your mouth.  The eggs Benedict is my go to 90% of the time i eat out for breakfast. I was NOT disappointed. And i order it more so than not!!!! Again, do yourself a favor and ORDER this! You wont regret it!  The service is outstanding, the food is mouth wateringly (i know thats not a word haha) perfect and the prices are fair and reasonable!!  BY FAR MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN VEGAS! I wish i could keep this a secret, but obviously the cat is already out of the bag... so i will tell you my little secret! :) Hope you all enjoy your food.",

You're welcomed immediately with a smile and our server Jasmine took care of us the entire time.   The food- was your average breakfast comfort food. What sets them apart from their competitors is how they make you feel when you walk, how they treat you while you're dining and the impression you have when you walk away! Definitely worth coming too",

Mr Mamas was one that popped up as a must visit.  After going there, I can see why.  They have a serious breakfast menu with favorites like waffles, pancakes, omelettes, etc but there's a few specialties like Mamas homemade biscuits and sausage gravy.  For those who prefer something different there are burgers, chili, sandwiches, soup and salad.  I never had biscuits and gravy so ordered it.  Now I have a standard to measure all other biscuit and gravy places.  The biscuit was soft and buttery, the gravy was thick with chunks of meat with a hearty flavor poured over the scrambled eggs I ordered.  My advice is unless you eat enough for 2, then plan on getting one plate and splitting it.  Their portions are generous and food is good.  The servers were great and made you feel like you're a regular.  Highly recommend and I will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "We stopped here on our way out of town and had a good breakfast.  Found the restaurant via yelp, of course, and reviews convinced us to give it a try.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table when we got there because it was a busy Monday morning, which was totally fine.  Food was great when it arrived.  I ate every bite on my plate, which is really not typical for me with breakfast.  I had ham and eggs (scrambled) with sourdough toast.  The only thing about our experience that was lackluster was our waitress. She was obviously busy and had a lot to do but she was only mildly friendly, which was surprising after reading all the other reviews.  Food was great, location wasn't bad - we were staying on the strip but we had a car so it was easy to find and parking was plentiful. We would visit again.",

There was a significant line with several large parties. But the host (Sean?) was a quip and assessed our wait time to the tee. 8 minutes. Lol. The Hospitable team is a plus! Funny to hear their conversations across the room--from the Kitchen to the wait staff to the host... all to ensure efficiency and a smooth customer experience. Reminds you of family banter! Definitely try it. I also get the feeling the locals love this place too!  Large portions... we shared the Mamas French Toast Breakfast. Perfect for 2.  Ty",

It's the hustle and bustle of the place that kind of kept me captivated.   I appreciated that there were two people on a four top, and that there was enough room between tables that made it comfortable for people to chat with your table mates.   There was a huge variety of foods. My husband and I went for an omelette and a fried chicken dish. The omelette was delicious, the California twist. I added bacon instead of ham and mushrooms. My husband's dish was spectacular but a little on the heavier side. Both delicious and we would definitely be back.   My coffee was always filled and there wasn't a moment where I needed to flag down someone to get something. It was the perfect amount of attentiveness.   I'm definitely for coming back!",

Right off the back, we could tell we were in a better place. really nice staff, friendly and happy. Service was fast and the owner clearly cares about his customers and takes the time to work the room and get to know his customers. All this was great.   The only problem, the food was really not that good. The house-made corned beef hash was made from good meat but dried out and burnt. The eggs were oily and cold, the breakfast meats were basically the stuff you'd get from a bulk food store like Costco and not the good stuff.  We so wanted to like it because the owner is such a great guy but the food was kind of a disappointment.",

    "text": "Husband and I visited Mr Mamas at husbands recommendation.  When I was pulling up and I saw a line of people waiting outside, I thought \"whaaaat?  On a Wednesday morning?\"  Husband assured me it would be fine.  We waited for about 10-15 minutes before we were sat.  First thing I noticed was how full the restaurant was.  At every single table were happy customers, eating, laughing, relaxed, conversating.  Our order was taken by Jazmin, who was very pleasant relaxed. We loved how she could take our order via her iPad-like device (and we found out later we could pay our bill the same way), making it clean and quick.  I ordered the French toast/w egg combo with a side of turkey bacon.  Husband ordered the Mamas burger (double cheeseburger) with onion rings.  Both our orders came out scrumptious and our drinks were never left empty.  I noted that the staff (I counted 9 working the floor and 5 working the kitchen) had been hustling but never at a point of anyone crowding or crashing with one another. Everyone knew what their and each other's jobs were.  Very efficient team.  I even noticed that the owner himself was hustling and had his head on a swivel, ensuring that everything was running smooth.  It was really appreciated that the manager, Cat, checked up on us at the end of our visit to make sure we were ok.  The bill was of a decent price and the service here was excellent.  This is a must recommend place, as I will be returning.",

Our waitress took our drink orders immediately the staff was so nice felt like home. It was our first time there so we asked for suggestions,  I was in the mood for breakfast so I ordered a pancake combo my husband wanted lunch, he got the mama burger which was humongous both were delicious! Our waitress kept checking on us to make sure everything was good and we didn't need anything.  The staff was amazing. We always like to have a good meal before we take the 3 hour drive back to Cali.

It is to be expected that they were packed. The guy who took my name said it will be around 25-30 minutes wait. He was awesome at what he does by the way. He kept us updated the whole time and he explained to anyone who walks in that the time is just an estimate and that it is not guaranteed. When we were finally seated, our waitress Jasmine was really nice and attentive. My coffee cup was never close to being empty. The manager would also stop by to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. This place really knows how to make their customers feel at home.   We ordered eggs Benedict, a pancake and an order of biscuits and gravy. It was nice of Jasmine to give us a heads up about their gravy.  Their gravy is not regular gravy. It has bacon bits and maple syrup in it. It sounded interesting so we gave it a try. It was so delicious! It was creamy and rich but not too heavy. The biscuits were crispy so it blends so perfectly with the creaminess of the gravy. The pancake was not dense and had a good texture. The benny was also amazing. The eggs were seasoned well and the bacon was cooked until it is crispy but not dry/hard. The hash browns were to die for! It was crispy on the exterior but was still soft and moist on the insides.   I highly recommend this place. Good food and good price.",

We visited the restaurant late Monday morning, and it was just about busy. We barely had to wait 3 minutes before we were seated. The staff are really efficient and kept the tables cleared very quickly, which meant you'd most probably not have to wait very long!  I had the French Toast with two sunnyside up's and turkey bacon on the side. No complaints. My friend had the Eggs Benedict Florentine and was very happy with the eggs and hollandaise sauce. Our portions were just about right which was great! Denisse served us and was such a darling, making sure everything was perfect during the meal. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

You got people checking on you with smiles on their faces, staff thanking you when you leave for coming in and people holding the door open for you when you leave saying \"Have a beautiful day!\"  I mean wow oh wow these folks are great! I told my fiance that we're definitely coming back here not only for the exceptional service but the wonderfully delicious food as well!  So, as some of you might know by now my go to breakfast food is eggs benedict! I think I'm addicted. How can one resist that perfectly poached egg and buttery hollandaise sauce? It's impossible! As soon as my fiance saw it on the menu he said \"I know what you're getting!\"  I thought maybe just maybe today I would try something new like a wrap but nope... I failed. I'm sure glad I went with my go to dish because it was ahhhhhmaaaazzzzing! The egg was perfectly poached, loved how it drizzled over my Canadian bacon and English muffin as I cut into it. Yum! And the hollandaise sauce?! Man, I couldn't get enough! Yum, yum and more yum! I passed on the hash browns and got a side of grits because well, I'm a Texas girl and I love my grits. They were perfectly made and came with two butters. Yep, used them both. Nope, don't feel bad about it at all.   Man oh man just writing this review has me reminiscing about that amazing breakfast and maybe drooling a little. Can't wait to go back!",

The door was opened, and we were welcomed with a smile by Mr. Mama himself. There is no pretentiousness about this place. It is just one large room with tables and chairs, no booths. The server was on us instantly, asking for our coffee, juice and water order, with no pressure for the breakfast order... Nice! I ordered 2 pancakes and a side of sausage patties, both were perfect. The pancakes are fluffy, and nearly the size of the plate, (glad I didn't order a \"stack\" which is 3 pancakes). A stack with a side would be enough to feed an adult and two children. The rest of our group had similarly sized portions of eggs, potatoes, etc. One of our group had the home made corned beef hash, one of the best ever! The server was attentive, constantly checking coffee refills and making sure we were otherwise satisfied. Mr. Mama showed a genuine interest in our satisfaction, thanked us, and asked us to return.",

Apparently it's their first day opening here at their new location..

My husband and I were not in the least disappointed that we did. Relocating from Georgia, it's not easy to find restaurants that serve grits but Mr. Mamas was one of the few who did. My husband ordered the Denver omelet and I ordered the short stacks. They should be named \"huge stacks\" for how enormous they are. Everything was off the chain and the portion sizes are great. We were so full that we couldn't eat all of our food and we didn't even touch the cinnamon roll that my husband ordered. When I told the server that it was my birthday, he didn't hesitate to have them fix me a free cinnamon roll to-go. What a thoughtful birthday gift! Not only was the food fresh and scrumptious- the service was superb. The waitress and hostesses were very attentive and so friendly. We highly recommend eating at Mr. Mamas and we will be coming back too.",

Background: I came here with a friend who is supremely picky but raved about the food. I set my expectations low but was totally blown away.  Atmosphere: the vibe in this place is very down home, down-to-earth, no fuss, no frills. It's simply (if somewhat sparsely) decorated and most of the tables are pretty much the same faux stone and wooden edged two-and-four-tops with pull out chairs.  Food: everything is generously sized, delicious and homemade. The pancakes are the size of dinner plates and the option of fresh fruit or chocolate chips. The biscuits and gravy were fantastic. With sausage gravy, it's easy to make it too heavy but this wasn't overwhelming. The home fries didn't come out of a bag and the hashbrowns with peppers, cheese, and gravy was a pretty inventive combination that sounds weird on paper but was actually great.  Service: our waitress Crystal was fantastic and rolled with it when we asked to split three different dishes. She was friendly and attentive and very personable. The manager, Cat, was also super great and friendly with everyone.  I will be back!",

They put a little bit of maple syrup in it so it's a little sweet. The hash browns were amazing!  The Denver omlet is HUGE! It's delicious and the portion of egg to cheese to vegies to meat are very balanced.   The Country Fried Steak was very good and the potatoes we ordered with it were delicious. It has the sweet gravy they use on the biscuits and gravy so just ask to taste the gravy first.   Overall the service was A+++ 100%!

    "text": "Long ago outgrowing the limited confines of their previous location, a visit in September of 2014 finding the small and narrow restaurant completely full, Mr. Mama's relocated to the corner of South Jones and West Russell Road the following March, late Breakfast over two-years later still finding the mom 'n pop place packing 'em in from open to close with waits as long as an hour on weekends for food that is affordable and competent, no less and no more.  Inexplicably one of Las Vegas most heavily Yelped! Businesses, the only presumed reason being that low prices and big portions are a selling point for that particular demographic as the online deal offering $30 of food for a $15 pre-purchase expired long ago, it was with another adult plus a ten year old boy that the group checked in at the podium just past noon on a Saturday and waiting alongside four twenty-somethings who Uber'd from the Strip plus a couple passing through from Utah for nearly thirty minutes the scene was nothing short of controlled chaos, servers moving at a steady clip with a manager directing traffic while intermittently snapping pictures of another full house.  Eventually landing a table along the north wall of the restaurant, the current location not doing much to upgrade the decor but nearly tripling the number of seats with an equivalent increase in servers and kitchen size, it was by an identical menu from three years ago that diners were greeted, a few daily specials including Pancakes or French Toast slathered in canned Fruit Compote immediately passed over in favor of a two-plate and three sides order tallying just over $50 prior to tip.  Literally filled to capacity until their 2pm closing time, no waiting diners turned away but the Open/Closed sign flipped over and no further seating allowed after the designated time, it was with a small glass of Milk and two Iced Coffees that the table waited another thirty minutes after seating for the whole order to be delivered at once, the house \"Iced Coffee\" similar to McDonald's in that it comes with Cream and Sugar already added while the Hot Brew poured over Ice is watered down and weak, though both are offered with endless refills for just three dollars.  Interestingly hiding prices on their website, an odd choice as most of the diner-staples ring in at a pricepoint similar to the big chains or other locally owned joints such as EggWorks or The Cracked Egg, it was with the table quickly flooded that pictures were taken and share plates were passed, the \"Mama's Stack\" putting sides of Sausage and Scrambled Eggs on a separate plate as the fluffy triple-stack overlapped its dish with Strawberries and Whipped Cream strewn on top, the addition of Pure Maple Syrup from home again showing the Pancakes to be rife with Buttermilk, not too dense and among the best in town.  Moving next to the Chicken Fried Steak, not a typical order but considered to be one of Mr. Mama's signatures and interesting enough in that regard to justify its $12.95 cost inclusive of three sunny-side Eggs, an unfortunately dry Biscuit and previously-frozen Homefries, suffice it to say there is nothing light about Sausage Gravy atop a pounded piece of deep fried Beef and although fans of the dish may say this is as good as it gets the fact of the matter is that it is certainly an acquired taste that did not go over well with 2/3 of the table thanks to the thick and largely flavorless Country Gravy.  Mistakenly ordering an extra Biscuit, the addition of some honey definitely improving things to at least a point of edibility, those looking for something far better would do well to order one of Mr. Mama's famous $3.50 Cinnamon Rolls, the yeasty curl piping hot beneath thick frosting while a similarly priced side of Onion Rings is enough to go around the table several times with crisp batter and nary a hint of greasiness.    **1/2:  A pleasant enough place, though clearly one who has generated a following by way of low prices as opposed to quality cuisine, Mr. Mama's reminds one of the sort of diner food that spawns big crowds after church in a small Midwestern town where creativity is for lack and abundance matters most.  FYI: Those looking to use coupons would be well advised to expect a wait, math not exactly a strong suit for the staff and the middle-aged male cook with a pot-marked face who may or may not be the owner clearly a loud and greedy man who does not understand the idea of 'fine-print.'",

However, I came here at 10:30AM on a Saturday morning with my two sons and as other yelpers have mentioned the parking lot has become nothing short of a tailgate party with many mid 20's millennials loitering the parking lot unknowingly waiting to be seated.  I came in and there was so many people I could have easily been labeled as someone who already was waiting.  Nobody even greeted me, had to call for the hosts attention several times, she was a little short with me and finally put my name on the list and she tells me 50 minutes to an hour to wait!  You have got to be kidding me?!  Please, hire more staff, welcome your guest with open arms and at least maybe create some outdoor seating so it doesn't look so uninviting to come to, because I honestly don't want to feel as if I'm another number.  Not sure if I will come back again because of this.  After 20 minutes of waiting, no where to sit outside and very antsy children I had no choice but to leave and go elsewhere.  I don't think I'll be back.",

We tried it for breakfast on a Saturday - waited about 30 minutes but the staff was super nice and even thanked us for waiting. Our group ordered chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, eggs Benedict, and pancake stack. We all thought it was great and very reasonably priced. It's your standard breakfast food. Nothing like the best you've ever had but good to make you want to come back. Our server was attentive and gave us ice water and refilled coffee promptly. We left really stuffed and ready for a nap! Spent $60 including tip for 4 people. Very good when we were trying to avoid an overpriced breakfast buffet. We would definitely come back and try lunch items.",

The friendliness and service begins before you walk in the door. The owner (Nick) and staff were very accommodating and welcoming.  I got the distinct impression that people actually LIKE working there.  Now for the breakfast fare. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs like many Yelpers recommended and it did not disappoint.  No need for the steak knife as you can cut it with your fork.  My server (didn't catch her name ) offered a sample of the gravy before the breakfast order was sent to the kitchen; nice touch.  With countless options around town, this ranks right up there with Jamm's etc. I never made it to their old location, but this one seats almost double and there are no issues with parking and is quite family friendly.  ATTN: Out of towners! Buffets? Forget about it!   Get out and explore, you will thank yourself later, not to mention it is also easier on the wallet.  Nick: Thank you my friend, you earned a customer for life. (when I'm in town, that is!)  Enjoy...",

I started with a cup of coffee to get a good feel. It was an awesome start! I ordered an egg white omelette with bacon avocado spinach and cheese. Guys shared chicken fried steak and eggs and mom had a cinnamon roll. The gravy made with sausage bacon and maple syrup delicious. A+ thank you Nick",

They have TVs in there so that you're able to watch while you wait.   I ordered an omelette. I'm not sure what it was called but it had avocados on it lol. Maybe it was the California omelette? Something like that. It was delicious! Order their house potatoes because those were super good. It came with bread & I usually get wheat bread. I also ordered hot tea & I'm pretty sure it was just the Lipton kind. The only complaint that I have is that their water sucks... It's tap water & I can really taste it lol but I'm a drama queen when it comes to water so yeah.   The service is really good tho! The servers are really nice & will check up on you frequently!",

The food is amazing, I have yet to receive something I didn't like. Although I do not live in Vegas, how I wish I had a Mr. Mama's in southern California. I would be there all the time. The gravy is a must. Whether it be right on your entree or on the side, the maple syrup, bacon, sausage concoction is the best thing ever. The biscuits are freaking great, very buttery, not too dry. I'm a breakfast person so I have yet to order a lunch item, but I'm sure they do not disappoint. Expect a wait for greatness here. Party of 6 waited for about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it. LOVE MR. MAMAS!!",

I'm not generally a breakfast person and wasn't too hungry so two of us split a full stack of pancakes and neither of us walked out hungry. The other party both got steak and eggs and neither of them complained.   There's nothing too fancy or incredible on the menu, just your basics done well. The host was friendly. The prices were decent. The food came out hot, it was pretty good and the service was on point as well. I had to ask for butter three times and each time I got my butter pretty fast. If you're doing regular pancakes I like to place a ball of butter between each pancake and let it melt with the heat, then hit the syrup...yelp tip courtesy of my arteries.  The place was packed for us on a Saturday morning so if you are coming on a weekend, expect a short wait.",

It being a Sunday & 4th of July weekend there was a wait. We made the choice to wait 35 minutes. I have to say it was worth the wait!  The staff was very friendly made us feel welcome & personable from the moment we walked in until the very end when we left. They all worked together helping each other out. A+. The server was very helpful she introduced the daily specials plus the popular items. The menu has quite the variety to choose from. Started off with a Cinnamon Roll that we all shared. That was good! A nice starter.  I ordered the Mamas Chicken Fried Steak with that O so Yummy Country Gravy, over hard eggs & home fries with sourdough toast! I enjoyed my meal very much. Didn't want it to end.  My friends ordered Mamas stack (bacon & eggs), homemade pancakes, Mamas Burger with onion rings & Greek Omelette. They all enjoyed their meals & were very happy.  I will soon be back. Definitely a must try. They get pretty busy but it's surely worth the wait.",

We came here the day after a long night out with hangovers. The breakfast (eaten more at lunchtime) was just what we needed. We got french toast, a build-your-own omelette, and started with a bowl of beef vegetable soup (weird I know but I wanted something substantial in my tummy fast) plus coffee and soda. The omelette was great -  we ordered it with ham and mushrooms plus fresh slices of avocado on top - it wasn't greasy like you often get at diners, so I was happy. The french toast was just ok - bread tasted not so fresh. Home fries that came with the omelette were ok, but not as crisp or as seasoned as we like. Beef vegetable soup had great flavor and tasted like something my mom would make (that's a good thing). In short, I'd give the service a five star and the food a three star - so I rounded it to an overall 4 star.",

Visiting from Texas with my wife for a birthday weekend in Vegas, and wanting to get off the strip for a good honest breakfast, this place was a gem. Greeted at the door by friendly people, perfectly great waitress before we even ordered. Very large pancakes, eggs cooked exactly as I asked for. I actually came back on a business trip and had 4 co-workers tag along, and they all loved it! I switched up for the French toast this time and it was even better! Very fair prices as well! Thank you Mr Mamas for being in business!",

Glad we did. First, the service was excellent. Mr Mamas visits each table. Very personable. They actually open the front door to greet you. Wait staff was very good. Second, the food was good. The star of the show was the plate of pancakes. HUGE and delicious. Highly recommend.",

We were greeted by the owner and he held the doors open for everyone. Great vibe overall. The only thing that I'm not so crazy about is the ceiling fans. For how hot it is in Vegas, it felt a bit warm inside, and the thought of the dust that might be collecting on the fans, that then was flying around was unpleasant. But needless to say, we'll be back more and more. Thank you for your great customer service!",

My girlfriend chose it randomly and I'm glad she did, I mean a free cinnamon roll for birthday celebrators? Awesome!   The cinnamon roll was ridiculous; the roll itself was insanely soft and melted in your mouth. The frosting was plentiful, but didn't overpower the cinnamon swirls. Truly a homemade dessert done right!   My girlfriend and I shared breakfast; a California egg white omelets and a side of biscuits and gravy. The omelet was delicious, fluffy eggs and all the fixing's; Cheddar Jack Cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, topped with avocado. This dish was huge and a perfect meal for sharing.   The biscuits were, light, fluffy, and coated in a amazing white gravy. I would probably pour this gravy on pizza if I weren't afraid for my heart stopping shortly after. Ham, sausage, and maple syrup are the ingredients in the thick concoction and you definitely get every flavor in each bite, savory and salty. Amazing combo!   There service here is stellar and my coffee cup was never empty. Mr. Mama, you have my heart.",

    "text": "My last review for the Decatur location I gave these guys 5 stars. I was ecstatic when they moved to this location for it is about twice the size and the parking is more than plentiful. If there was a candidate for 6 stars this would be the place! Because if the old location is as good as it gets then this new location just made it even better!  Now as we made our way in the first time one sunday morning, there were people waiting to be seated. I asked what the wait time was and they said about 10 minutes. THEY LIED! But in a good way. After about 5 minutes we were seated with menus in hand.   I was kind of afraid that with the bigger size of the place that the great service that we have come to expect might have gone downhill a bit. Im happy to report that they are chugging right along! Service was spectacular! Like they never left the old location! What I love about the service is that they always seem to have plenty of servers running around. Not only do you have your main server, but other servers help out as well whether its picking up your empty plates, refills, or bringing out your order as soon as its done.  As for the food, if you refer to my last review it is still the same. These guys are mainly a breakfast place but you do have other options as well like burgers, sandwiches, wraps, subs, salads, etc. If you are really hungry I have to mention the Mama's Burger ($11.95). Two half pound beef patties, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, avocado and an onion ring. I thought I was really hungry when I ordered this but I was so wrong. It's basically like eating two burgers. Might as well cut it in half and share!  For you omelet lovers, I highly recommend getting the Cali Omelet ($8.50). It has cheddar jack cheese, sausage, pico de gallo, sour cream, and then topped with avocado. We always have them add bacon to it because bacon makes anything better. This meal comes complete with your choice of home fries or hash browns. I usually get hash browns for they cook it so crispy. You also get your choice of toast from sourdough, white, or wheat. I always get sourdough and they automatically butter it for you.  Some useful info. They used to have a 15 for 30 dollar Yelp deal but I did not see it last time we went but if it comes back you definitely want to take full advantage of it. What took its place is a free beverage with the purchase of an entree with check in. Their business hours are Monday thru Friday 6 am to 3 pm. Saturday and Sunday 7 am to 2 pm.   In closing, the drive is worth the trip here and you are not too far away from the strip. It's definitely a nice change of pace from those marked up so called fancy places.

It came with eggs and some home potatoes that a bit far for over easy for me but good. The cakes looked good so order some but unfortunately never got them but will Def be back for them next time I'm in town. The service was good dispite us showing up at 130 Jena was great.

I had eggs over medium and BF had over easy-both cooked exactly as asked. Pancakes the size of the plate and delicious. Side of home fries were great-crunchy outside and soft insides-salivating just thinking about it.   Did a to-go order for lunch and WOW!

First, be prepared for the owner to meet you at the door and welcome you, get you seated, and share a story or two if you are interested.  While in Vegas for three days I had breakfast here twice and both times the quality of service and food was excellent.  This is excellent prepared home cooking, in a clean well managed restaurant.  Generous portions, fast and friendly service and it seemed like everyone working there was upbeat, friendly and efficient.  The prices I felt were reasonable based on the quality and quantity of the food.  If you want to experience some local (outside the casino) good food in a great atmosphere go have breakfast at Mr Mamas, you will not be disappointed.",

They offered decent portion sizes at a reasonable price. I had steak, eggs, and shredded hashbrowns. But, to me it left a lot to be desired. My steak had a bland taste to it (Big Mama wasn't in the kitchen), the eggs were nothing special and they slapped a slice of cheese on my shredded hashbrowns. I also had one of their famous cinnamon rolls....dough with frosting and cinnamon (lots of cinnamon).  All of that said, my crew was satisfied. They had pancakes and enjoyed them.  The owner was extremely nice. If I judged the restaurant on hospitality alone, I'd give them five plus. Top notch customer service, I just expected more flavor.",

And the tator tots were some of the best I've ever had. If you're looking for a cheap breakfast that is sure to be delicious, this is the place.",

But I've had better. The potatoes were amazing! Still worth 4 stars. Husband had the country fried steak and had absolutely no complaints. Coffee was however plain coffee.. Nothing special. Overall, this place is a must go for breakfast. They are fast and very affordable for the amount of you get. Definitely will return.",

Our server Jose was quick and attentive. Portions are large and the food is delicious.  The pancakes which are large, fluffy, light with fruit filling and topped with freshly picked strawberries were very good. Ditto the French toast with eggs and sausage. The veggie omelet was made with lots of vegetables. My ribeye steak (tender and well seasoned) and eggs was also very satisfying. It was a wonderful breakfast for all.",

As I yelped search for breakfast places I found Mr. Mamas with nice reviews and a lot of raving reviews for their top selling Chicken Fried Steak. I like to consider myself as a CFS connoisseur so before even looking at the menu, I knew what I was ordering.   Hospitality and friendliness of staff is a five star rating, but unfortunately I can't base it only on that. My wife ordered steak and eggs and I , the chicken fried steak. I was not completely wow'd by the food, but it was still worth the four stars. I feel the steak was a bit too thin and the CFS a bit bland, but the country gravy with bacon, sausage, and maple syrup adds to the flavor of the CFS. The portions are of good proportions.   To locals, I recommend this place but they do get busy. To the tourists, I say come here instead of the mediocre breakfast buffets where your food sits in food steamers. You will get full and you'll spend less.   To Mr. mamas, keep up your excellent practice of interacting with your patrons, because even high end restaurants lack in getting personal with their guests.",

I can't even think of a time where the positive demeanor of a restaurant staff raised my spirits up. Everybody is very friendly here, especially the owner. It's something you don't experience in a lot of establishments these days.   I would say the food here is an extension of that family oriented nature of this place. I ordered the simple stuff. Two eggs, scrambled, with a side of home fries, and wheat toast. All of it was a taste of comfort.   The scrambled eggs and home fries were nicely seasoned, so it didn't even require any condiments to to be added. And I love butter on my toast. They spread the perfect amount of it here.  Even with such a simple plate, the portions were generous and left me full and satisfied. I'll surely be back whenever I'm in the mood to go out to get some home-style breakfast food!",

This place is very busy, and for good reason: the food is good, the atmosphere is homey, and the prices are very reasonable. When we recently visited the owner was at the door, talking with a patron as they exited. He then turned to us, and guided us to our table which was being cleaned. From there, our server just continued the chain, and we were attended to with tea and coffee never getting empty.  Date had the patty melt (very, very good) and I had the Cali omelette based upon Yelp recommendations. The hive mind was useful: the Cali omelette was indeed something to try and I would recommend it to others. Bonus points they have sour dough toast here, and use real butter on it!  If you're in town visiting and want a nice place to have breakfast or brunch, or maybe you live in the area, you should swing by and give this place a go.

The menu offers plenty of fresh breakfast options, the restaurant is flexible with customizing/modifying ingredients to your liking, and it's not all breakfast.  If I were a local, I would be here weekly.  Sadly, since I am not, Mr. Mama's has become a MUST visit when we're in the area and a place to recommend to friends.  SERVICE +The staff is friendly-super chill. On a four day trip, we ate here twice.  On our second visit the hostess remembered us- little things go a long way.   +Table service- very attentive without being overbearing.  Your coffee cup will not go unfilled, they have a specific person who only does drinks, used plates are immediately removed.  For a casual unassuming place, the quality of service was a pleasant surprise.    FOOD +AMAZING  This is definitely my favorite breakfast spot in the US.  Their website boasts how they \"put a smile on your face\"-- they do.  You'll want to work your way through the menu.    2 Eggs and Toast $4.50  (5 STARS) +Eggs cooked to your preference, select from 5 different types of toast (sourdough for me), fresh home fries are also included (add peppers and/or jalapenos for my fellow spice lovers)    Pancakes  (5 STARS) +Order a single, short stacks (2), stacks (3), pancakes (2)  Buttery, fluffy, light, warm, delectable, perfection  Cinnamon Roll  (4.5 STARS) +It does not disappoint.  Cinnamon rolls are freshly made, served on the small plate, airy, light... My husband LOVED it.  He particularly appreciated how the cinnamon roll wasn't too dense.   French Toast (5 STARS) +Choose from a plethora of options-1, 2, 3 with bacon, sausage, ham, etc.    I want to try the: +Breakfast burritos +Omelets (they're huge-fit the plate) served with sides +I'm eying the BLT and Mamas Sandwich (Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Pepperjack cheese- select your bread)  What I wish: +That they had fresh juices... just a thought! ;o)  PRICE Pricing is reasonable.

Took family that was in town to breakfast and they loved it, portions, flavor, service and staff were awesome. I would recommend going here, especially since I work in the same industry I say its amazing to dine to be at such a great ambiance while being taken care of. Service is quick and dishes are yumm. =) Definitely recommend!!!.",

Once again if you treat your customers well and make them feel welcomed then you can have mediocre food and still maintain a great customer base for some people dont always need or search for good food they rather prefer great service. Lets get to the food  Cinnamon Roll (3/5)- The Infamous Cinnamon Roll did dissapoint. I was expecting something out of this world but in the end it tasted like a sweet hawaiian roll with cinnamon and frosting if you know what i mean. It didnt knock my socks off. I personally wouldnt recccomend it.  *New ITEM* Corned Beef Hash And eggs w/Toast- (4/5)- The owner personally came over after this dish came out and said its homemade with Dill and seasonings added for the unique flavor. they made it crispy just the way a corn beef hash is supposed to be. it wasnt mushy at all. The only thing is I would really have to be in the mood for this dish so its not on the radar for something i would order again here for which i have had better.  Chicken Fried Steak n Eggs w/toast- (4/5)- Another dish which was made unique for their gravy. their sausage gravy had a very good flavor to it. i think if i were to compare it to something it would be italian sausage added to their country gravy it gave it a spicyness to it. This dish was my favorite but a very big portion which for the price was awesome. i even had leftovers because i couldnt finish it and for me i usually have no problem finishing my dish.   BTW i usually dont order hash browns over country potatoes but when you eat here they make a great hashbrown and i made that mistake when i ate here.   Overall a solid meal and i have no problem coming back for a bite. Keep it up Mr.Mamas.",

    "text": "We were in the area on a Saturday morning and decided we needed a hearty breakfast meal. A quick yelping and we landed on Mr. Mamas. 2000+ reviews and pushing 4.5 stars? That was solid enough for us.  Overall Mr. Mamas wasn't hard to find, but the place is busy. There were people waiting outside and inside. We gave our names and were seated in about 15 mins. Not bad. The inside is nice and the lady/hostess who was seating us was personable and easy going. Our server was also good. Quick with the water refills and quick on taking our orders.  We glanced around at the other tables and the food portions looked pretty good which was good because we were going to embark on a long day of doing nothing but watching Netflix on the couch, playing games on our phones, and fall asleep on the couch (all boilerplate Saturday activities).  So here's what we ordered and what we thought:  Steak and Eggs: Steak was cooked medium and came out medium. Tasted fine. Eggs tasted good also (overhard). Denver Omelette: Good size. Tasted good. One thing we wished for was a \"works\"-kind of omelette that had everything such as sausage, bacon, bell peppers, three kinds of cheese, ham, onions and mushrooms topped with avocado. Yes, we could've added each one of those individually to the Denver, but it would've added like 6+ bucks more. We kind of wished there was already one of these on the menu since we didn't really want to add FULL portions of each additional topping in, but more like having more variety then be charged like 12 bucks or something. Oh well, not the end of the world. Mamas Stack: Pancakes are very large. Eggs (basted - it's like sunnyside up, but they cook the top a little with oil to make it less slimy). Bacon (thick cut kind). This is a solid choice if you're feeling like I did and just wanted standard issue breakfast food that you know and recognize.  Everything tasted fine and as you'd expect, but nothing really outstanding, but more importantly, nothing disappointing. Mr. Mamas is a good choice if you're in the area. Personally I'd go to Peg's Glorified Ham and Eggs since I like they they have Hawaiian options and Skillets and the menu is slightly more toward my taste buds.",

    "text": "Wow...   Great first time experience at Mr Mamas... and that line outside as we drove by, there's a reason for it. Don't be intimidated by the long line of guests waiting to dine in, believe me, their solid 4-1/2 Star rating speaks for itself so if you have the patience to wait... please wait.   We wanted to dine somewhere where we didn't have to pay for parking and avoid more walking inside casinos just to get to the dining place... in other words, not on The Strip. Found Mr Mamas on Yelp, it was about 9 miles from where we were staying.   Got there and we put our name on the waitlist. Was told that there was a 20-min wait for our party of 7. Not too bad. Shortly after our name was called and we were led to our table. Denise was our server and she was friendly and sweet. Soon after we placed our orders our food was served. I ordered the Mamas Short Stack (2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and I chose bacon). Oh man... I usually eat my pancakes last but after my first bite of the large, fluffy, made-from-scratch, buttermilk pancake I couldn't stop eating it. So delicious! Also, the menu didn't say how many strips of bacon came with the meal (but I expected the usual 2 skinny strips)... I got 5 slices and they were large strips! I'm telling you, usually this traditional breakfast doesn't fill me up even with two slices of white toast but I couldn't even finish my meal. So darn yummy!   My brother can't stop raving about the onion rings. You see, his Swiss Mushroom Burger came with onion rings already (choice from five others) but he liked it so much he ordered an extra side of more onion rings. He said that the 1/2-lb meat on his burger was fresh, not frozen... and he knows a thing or two about burgers living in Stuttgart Germany! I'd like to go on with what the rest of my family's experiences were with their orders but this review will be too long. Let's just say all 3 kids approved... and they're picky eaters.  Great staff! And one last thing... \"Mr Mamas\" came to our table and chatted with our party for a bit while we waited for our food. He did this to all his guests. Very friendly and humble person. He greeted everyone making sure his guests were okay... and I also happened to see him clearing out dirty dishes from tables once in a while. As I caught him supervising the dining area I came up to him and thanked him for a lovely brunch and mentioned why I can see that his restaurant was \"loved\" by Yelp and local customers. His first response was, \"Thank you, I am blessed.\" Awesome! Will gladly come back the next time we're in town :)  Review #1064",

At 4.5 stars and only a mile away, Mr Mama's was the logical choice.  I ordered the cheeseburger with extra crispy hash browns. The burger was as advertised being medium-well. It's moist and flavorful. Beware of the red onions - they are so strong you'll not have intimate contact for a week...  My friend had the ham & cheese omelette. He reported that it was moist and that he definitely enjoyed the meal.  Not sure who is \"Alex\" but every 2-3 minutes some staff member would call out his name across the restaurant. After the first couple of times it became quite annoying. That having been said, we wondered if the staff was playing a new form of \"Marco Polo\".",

FYI! this place gets busy so be prepared to wait awhile but trust me the wait is worth it. me and a guest waited about 45 minutes due to the high volume but was well taken care of when we finally sat. the owners are very active and even graced us with a free cinnamon roll as payment for the wait. all the staff looked excited and made us feel part of the family, not once did my cup go empty.  I had the special vanilla bean pancakes and my taste buds went to the moon. the chief had it on the menu for that day but hopefully I can have it when I return. thank you guys for showing me a good time with good food. I hope you all try this place and enjoy as much as I did.",

You can tell they put some care in their coffee, and I really appreciate that. Not to mention, it was piping hot every time!   My Greek Omelet was very tasty and fruit was very fresh.   I particularly loved the atmosphere that all the servers and manager created by being very personable and making sure everyone was truly happy with their breakfast.   It almost felt as if the entire team was one big family taking care of the family restaurant.   I loved it!",

All of the staff here are super courteous. As we ate the owner himself, Mr. Mamas, came out to talk to us. He was very involved, observant and talkative. We got to have a nice little conversation with him about the name and the restaurant. The food was your typical diner food, we ordered breakfast- I had the eggs Benedict and they were good. Price was not bad at all. This place makes you feel super comfortable and welcomed with how the staff treat you. Will definitely be back when I visit Vegas again.",

We heard you should get the cinnamon roll, so we did and it was so good!!  Definitely a great spot on your trip to Vegas. Cheaper than the strip and much better food and service as well!!",

From the moment you enter, you sense that the staff care about their customers and the work they do.  While it can be pretty crazy during peak times, such as when I went, staff worked well as a team.  Because of that, while it was super busy, there was never a sense of chaos or staff that were run off their feet.  I also appreciated how Nick took the time to constantly go around the restaurant connecting with the patrons.  We had the popular fried chicken as well as the rib eye steak and eggs and a side of waffles.  They were good picks and solid breakfast items.  The chicken with gravy was good-sized and fried just right. I liked that the gravy was not overly salty as is the case at many other places.  The steak was very tender for a breakfast (i.e. thin) steak.  Again, just the right size for breakfast.  Thank you Mr. Mama for creating a good memory. I'll be back.",

I had the blackened steak(I think that's what it's called) and it had a bit too much seasoning which made it hard to enjoy the meat but I asked for very very rare and I got that so it's forgivable.   This feels like a mom and pop place because the people here treat you like it's family breakfast. They seat quickly and the waitress we got topped our drinks without having to be asked. She frequently checked on us and made sure we were taken care of. It's not super pricey just watch out how many things you \"add on\" because it can get pricey .   The customer service made me happy though. Very much recommend.",

The receptionist at the door was very friendly and told me it would only be about 15 minutes and he said if you can't wait 15 minutes for their food then you should probably go somewhere else. He was joking of course.   If you have small children it is probably best to order one breakfast for them and split it between them. I am giving you fare warning that the short stack of pancakes is enough to satisfy Paul Bunyan and his pal Babe the blue ox. Seriously, it was a lot of food for my kids and most of it went to waste. My wife ordered a cinnamon roll and that thing is about the size of a water balloon. It was a lot of roll, so I did what good husbands do and I ate most of it. She also went with a veggie omelet and said it was good. I had the country fried steak. They make a special gravy for it. It is plenty of food for you to share. I was feeling like a pig that day, so I truly was what I ate.   It's a great place to stop for breakfast. Excellent service and great food. Simple and inexpensive. Get away from that resort you are staying at and make the drive just a few minutes west of the strip. I guarantee that it will be much better than that overpriced breakfast available downstairs at your hotel (that's unless you are staying at the best hotel ever with incredible breakfast). I'm sure the locals want to keep this place a secret. Happy eating!",

    "text": "The prices, portions, service, and food all score high for me, and I'm betting this place goes up another star on my next visit.   I had the French toast and the western omelette. French toast wasn't world changing, but it was good. I like salsa with my eggs. It costs 1.25 extra but it made my omelette extra delicious. Most of their omelette combos (includes regular toast and your choice of potatoes) cost less than $10, a great value. There doesn't seem to be a charge for substituting one veggie for another.   Tip: the western omelette doesn't come with cheese. No big for me, but I just assumed omelets came with cheese.   I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their well-reviewed biscuits and gravy",

It was delicious and that sealed the deal for my husband who went on the order the chicken fried steak and eggs which is covered this gravy.

The restaurant was packed but we were the first on the waitlist and the hostess was so kind. We initially were a party of four but a friend decided to join last minute and although we added a bit more time to our wait, we were assured that it wouldn't be an issue and we were sat in about fifteen minutes.  The menu has a little bit of everything. I was pulled towards the burrito but the corned beef hash is what won me over. It's not shredded corned beef, which is my favorite, but the hash was crumbled and packed with salty and rich flavor. The hashbrowns were wildly crispy and my over medium eggs were yolky and divine. I opted for their swirled rye and made perfect bites on the buttery toast. My table shared two of their cinnamon rolls and OH. MY. GOD. They were gooey and rich, covered in frosting with every bite.   There was a gentleman walking around and he offered to take a photo of our group saying, \"You need a family photo.\" He stood up on a chair in a busy restaurant to take several photos of us on my phone. He worked there and was just doing a nice thing. It caught me by surprise and was definitely appreciated.   Oh, and the coffee was good. A lot of breakfast spots overlook their roasted bean treat but Mr Mamas did it right. Really looking forward to going back again.",

They offer a selection of breakfast food that is pretty typical, eggs, bacon, burritos, pancakes etc. The food is not bad but its nothing special and the prices are kinda high. The first time I went it was pretty good, the second I was more disappointed. I ordered home fries and received what looked like pre frozen cubes of potato with no seasoning or flavor. Overall its so so, I doubt I will be coming back as I have found other places in Vegas with better food and cheaper prices. I have not tried lunch here so I do not know if its better.",

Portions were great, cooked exactly the way we asked for it and we got it fast. I can't wait to try their lunch next time. Oh, the pancakes were as big your head! So good and fluffy.

    "text": "I was so excited to try Mr Mamas for a nice diner breakfast. I was totally craving one morning a Jersey-style diner experience. In terms of the food, Mr Mamas fits the bill - no frills, no nonsense, down-to-earth breakfast comfort food. Pancakes were huuuuuuge, fluffy and yummy. Seriously, no complaints about the food here.  I was, however, disappointed with the service, which I expected to be spectacular given all the prior raving reviews. We were seated right away, but then basically ignored for the next 10-16 minutes. Ten minutes passed, and we attempted (and succeeded on our third try) to wave down a waiter. We asked if we could order since no one has come by our table yet. His asked us who our waiter was, which from our perspective was an odd thing to ask because had we known that, we wouldn't have stopped him. We said that we didn't know since literally no one has come by to greet us, or give us water or take a drink order. \"Well I don't know who is taking care of your table today, you need to ask the person who is responsible for your table\" was his answer before he walked off. I get it, he was a young server and maybe did not know any better, but then we tried waving down someone else and 2-3 times we were either rebuffed or outrightly ignored. My mother commented that she saw someone by the cashier acknowledge her (a manager, perhaps?) by nodding and waving in her direction that he would get to her shortly, but another 10 minutes passed and he never did.   Our waitress finally came around the 20-minute mark, but the damage was done. My parents, who rarely dined out, felt ignored and unhappy with the experience. My hubby, who needed to be back on the Strip within a certain time for business, asked the waitress typically how long it takes for food to get out. Her answer was that she \"didn't know\" - apparently a popular refrain. Just because a place in Vegas serves and looks like a Jersey diner, doesn't mean it operates with the efficiency of a Jersey diner - lesson learned for this naive tourist.  I wouldn't mind coming back here again and giving it another shot, but doubt i will return since my family was unhappy with the treatment. Unfortunate, because the food was very decent and prices fair.",

The most outstanding thing is the number of hardworking people in this restaurant, a large number of workers who are all busy.  Second, everyone is incredibly friendly, and you probably won't get in or out of the restaurant without a very cheery welcome and thank you.  The service is spectacular.  The food: pretty standard breakfast fare -- no exotic options here.  I went with chicken fried steak.  The steak seemed a little pre-fab (my only complaint) but was very well seasoned (thank you!). And the gravy was excellent.  Homemade and tasty (I had been to another restaurant in the previous week that had average gravy and was disappointed).",

The good is that the owner introduced himself when we entered and was very friendly.  Our waitress was very nice too.  My eggs were cooked properly which can be tough when you order over medium.

I really appreciated that when my husband order the Mamas club (lunch sand which) the waitress suggested getting it grilled and explained the difference vs the toasted way its traditionally served.

    "text": "What a fabulous place!!! Nothing fancy, just good food and good people. Everyone makes you feel welcomed, our first time there and they made me feel like family. They've got customer service nailed!!! When we arrived we were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes and the hostess apologized. Every 5 minutes, she thanked us for coming and apologized for the wait. This is why we stayed, we had a busy schedule and most places that tell you 20-25 minutes turns into 45 minutes. Not here, we were seated in 15 minutes.The waitress, Loures, was so friendly; she kept my coffee cup full. I never had to ask for more coffee, her attention to small details was amazing. The owner, Nick, greeted everyone and THANKED them for coming to his place. Nick stopped at every table to check and chat. We never felt rushed. They also offer free Wi-Fi; all the tables seat four people so there's plenty of room to spread out.  Now for the food, everything was cooked perfectly. I like sunny side up eggs, where the yolk is warm and runny, but the egg must me cooked and that's exactly what I received. The pancakes were hot and fluffy not rubbery. The sausage patties are huge, took one home. My husband ordered, per the recommendation of our waitress, the country fried steak; the gravy was thick and tasty. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. Simple home cooked good food and friendly service is why you come here. They have a wide array of omelets and  I've heard the French toast is fabulous and I'm looking forward to trying these items next time.  The reason for a four instead of a five - I like going to places that have a signature dish or specialty - something you can't get anywhere else. The food is cooked to perfection here, but there's nothing unusual on the menu. You can go anywhere in town and get eggs, pancakes, omelets, and hamburgers, but if you want chocolate chip pancakes or blueberry pancakes or crab omelets, go someplace else, there's nothing fancy here. But if you want a clean friendly place, food cooked perfectly, and reasonable prices you can't find any place better. Definitely going back for breakfast and I'll have to try lunch.",

Going in was cool 'cause there was an observant host. The guy was pretty badass looking - tattoos, ear piercings with a raspy tone of voice. LOL. But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple, and was like \"Hey guys, I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?\" Totally considerate, but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day, so I let him take their name down first instead. Same guy chatted it up with everyone that was waiting, wished everyone a good day when they left, and still managed to keep track of tables to fill, etc.  Once seated, the good vibes and customer service didn't stop with him. We had Jasmine as our waitress, and she was extremely sweet and polite. She constantly checked up on us, even after we paid as we finished up the meals. Liked how she kept my coffee topped off 'cause I definitely needed it that morning/afternoon. Food was definitely tasty, came out warm from the kitchen, and was a decent portion for breakfast/brunch.  Random, surprising moment of the meal was when my boyfriend got his burger, flipped the top bun off to spread ketchup, and the same host was like \"Hey buddy, lemme get you different lettuce... If my lettuce looked like that, I wouldn't want it.\" The lettuce was seriously no big deal to the boyfriend (were pieces closest to lettuce head's core), but he definitely appreciated the consideration and attention to detail the guy gave/had.  Overall, I liked the meal. Very fulfilling and homey, and the customer service made it all a better experience.",

It was not until they offered the yelp deal that I made the leap. I can make breakfast at home, so why should I come here to pay for it? I now understand why.   First of all, the service was incredible. We arrived around 11 am expecting to wait, but there was no wait, and we were quickly seated. The staff was friendly, quick, informative, and more than willing to help. It's so rare to find a place where people just ooze top quality service, especially at these prices.   The pricing really is phenomenal. You can eat lunch here for just about $10 including tip.   We tried the cinnamon roll to start, and it did not disappoint. It was warm and fresh and oh so fluffy. It was a great way to start the day.   The biscuits were top notch. Fluffiness seems to be a theme here, and I appreciated how fresh these biscuits were.   I also did not understand the hype over the hash browns, but now I do. They came to the table incredibly hot and well seasoned. They weren't too crispy, which is perfect for me.   The pancakes were pretty good. They were tough to cut, but the flavor was strong and traditional.   The reuben sandwich was very well received at our table, which is certainly saying something when a place is known for breakfast, and our reuben aficionado can be picky.   We will definitely be back. This warm, neighborhood restaurant is truly top quality.",

Ive informed many of my friends about this restaurant , most have lived in Vegas for quite some time ( and knew nothing about this place ) .",

Absolutely everyone was jovial and pleasant and it truly felt like a family place. We were greeted by nearly everyone in the family-owned restaurant and had trouble deciding what to order...everything sounded so delicious! I ordered coffee and was excited to be able to take fresh cream with it, kind of a rarity in Vegas diners! Once we had decided on what to eat, we didn't wait long before we were served our meal. It was not only excellently prepared (I may have had the best poached eggs of my experience) but there was great care put into selecting the ingredients to be served.   On the whole, this place is wonderful and worth the drive. My date was also a big fan of the place! I'm so glad we found it; I'm determined to return as often as I can and to bring friends and family along with me!",

I think they oven cook it which is my favorite way to prepare bacon. The cinnamon roll was ok. My wife ordered short stack pancakes  which I wouldn't order again, not enough flavor development.  Neither would I get the cinnamon roll. My eldest ordered the breakfast burrito which her and my wife said was the best thing on table. My youngest had the chicken fried steak breakfast which lacked some seasoning but it was ok. They delivered our parfait late it was average at best. Overall, its a nice place, the staff were super friendly and helpful but the food is nothing to write home about.",

We waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. I ordered the steak and eggs which is a thin slice of ribeye steak. It was very tender cooked exactly as I asked.  My son had the ham and eggs and he said the ham was perfect.  To top off the meal, the pancakes are a must. Huge portion and absolutely yummy!  The service was quick and friendly. We were helped by Denisse who was super nice and very attentive. This place is a must!! Great food super affordable.",

The owner is from Michigan and his food is  Midwestern. He's currently walking around to every table thanking people for coming, like he's done every time I've been here. It's probably the only place in Vegas you can eat well for under $20. This is a locals' joint and no reservations, but well worth the wait. Be sure to have any of the favorites: homemade biscuits and gravy, omelettes, pancakes, and breakfast potatoes.",

Crazy busy all the time and located in a strip mall on Jones and Russell. The location is kind of a out of the way, but don't let that fool you. They are crazy busy all the time and often a line out the door to get a table. Just goes to show you that if you provide good food and good service, people will flock to your door.

Don't remember what I got last time, but this time was the ham & eggs with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Didn't care for the gravy, so they kindly took it off the check.  The eggs and ham were ok - the eggs and hash browns both needed seasoning.  My daughter got only the hash browns and dumped a ton of salsa on it.  Which reminds me, all the up selling is $1.95 - veggies, $1.95, salsa $1.95, etc., etc.        Portion sizes, prices and service all good.  It just isn't worthy of anything more than 3 stars.",

The only thing even close to a nah was a little bit of a wait but hey, when you have great food and great service, what do you expect...  So the food was exceptional and priced very reasonable. I have the house made corned beef hash and eggs and a side of biscuits and gravy. Both were fantastic! My girlfriend had the French toast and pancakes which were also super yummy.  Our server was also super awesome. It's been a while since I was there so I can't recall her name but she was very attentive, gave great recommendations and described the dishes and flavors. Really good service.  Definitely time to make my way back there for another breakfast outing soon!",

The food was so good and before I could take photos everything was half gone. The chocolate french toast had the perfect amount off egg batter. The Reuben arrived with moist meat without making the bread soggy. Beverage portions are large. You can choose the bread/cheese for your grilled cheese sandwich. The hash browns and spinach omelet arrived hot and tasty. This is a great spot away from the strip and you can get breakfast all day.",

I personally think this is one of if not THE best spot to have breakfast in town. It's not fine dining, just a casual diner with some delicious grub.   I was a customer of the original Mr Mamas when they were located in a much smaller building on Decatur. The new location is so much nicer, but the word is out about this spot... there is almost always a wait to be seated. The employees here are efficent and get food out and tables cleared quickly.    Service in general is just excellent... Mr Mama himself regularly stops by tables to see how people are doing, what a charming man he is! Every member of the staff I have interacted with has been friendly and I honestly feel like my patronage is appreciated when I eat here.   Stand outs on the menu for me are the Marty wrap, the french toast and I love their home fries. Don't skip the cinnamon roll, it's delicious.  Yelp Reviews 2018 30/100",

My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and single pancake. I am glad he shared his EB as they were PERFECT! Now on to my breakfast: my steak was well done (I ordered Medium) my eggs with cheese and hash browns were good, the biscuits were flaky and buttery but the sausage gravy was anything but flavorful. I found myself reaching for the salt/pepper shaker to make up for the lack of flavor. My pancake was OK, but I have had better and it was definitely NOT anything to write home about. Our server was polite and attentive and made sure to check on us several times. Would we go back? I suppose we could give it another chance because one does tend to get tired of buffets and all the crowds. Over all the food was good but due to the great reviews on Yelp I was slightly disappointed.",

My father managed to scrape his leg somewhere between the car and the entrance. Right when we sat down a staff member noticed the fresh minor cut on my dad's leg and checked to see if there is anything he could do to help. A couple extra napkins later we ordered out meal and a few short moments later our meal arrived. I was incredibly impressed about the prompt service in a busy establishment. Every employee was personable. However, Mr. Mamas doesn't deserve five stars for personality; it's the food itself that makes this place a must go for breakfast. Usually, I'm very hesitant to order steak before noon. At most breakfast places \"steak\" means cheap n' chewy. This was far from the case. Every bite was savory and succulent. Even though they brought A1 steak sauce, it was far from necessary. In the end, the bill was affordable and everyone left satisfied. It is easily the best way to start the day in Vegas. Next time we go to Vegas, best believe we will make a visit to Mr. Mamas!",

Customer service was EXCELLENT tho very friendly staff very very friendly..... only thing I'd honestly say was that Mr. Mamas  food needs Aunt Jemamas seasoning. It's like Caucasian style southern cooking",

I ordered a cheese a mushroom omelet which came with a choice of hash browns or potato squares (I think that was the second option). You also get a side of toast. All for $9 - and it was delicious. Very moist and cheesy! My friend also had an omelet, can't remember what it was but it looked very yummy! Packed with veggies!   I also really appreciate how quick the service was too. Even when it got busier they were still very attentive.   It was 8am when we arrived; pretty dead at the time. When 9 rolled around, the place was packed - this was on a Monday.",

I think we waited under 10 minutes for our food to be brought out after ordering. I had the breakfast burrito (yummy, although I liked it better with ketchup than the salsa it came with) and my husband had the chicken fried steak, which our server recommended. Both dishes were delicious.  I don't know if we'll be back in the area anytime soon, but if we are we'll definitely stop by again!",

We already felt really bad because they were closing in 30 minutes. However, it was our last chance to eat here and we HAD to try! First of all, I'm assuming Mr. Mama himself is the one who stood up to greet us at the door, already a gold star in my book. We ordered a cinnamon roll, two omelettes, and an eggs Benedict. All were delicious, but I think it was the really homey feel that made is enjoy our meal that much more.  Unfortunately we don't live in Vegas, but will be back if only to eat here!

The layout of the restaurant is awkward.   Many tables are right next to wait stations or the bathrooms, which is very uncomfortable.  When we asked not to be seated by the restroom, it was a MAJOR issue with management.   The wait staff is slow and inattentive.  They spend their time chit-chatting with each other and on cell phones.  Management spends its  time running around taking pictures for the website instead of respecting the customers and leaving them alone to eat.  We tried  more than once to patronize this restaurant in order to support a local business, but each time was the same.  After attempting one last time to see if things had improved, we were actually told we were not welcome back to the restaurant!!  As if WE did something!!   What it boils down to is this was in direct response to us posting a negative review.  Why don't you listen to all the negatives reviews, Nick, and fix the problems instead of trying to deflect?  You have lost a tremendous number of customers who will no longer patronize your restaurant due to your treatment of my mom and I.  They tell 2 friends....  they tell 2 friends...",

I had the bacon and eggs - eggs over easy - and hashbrowns well done.  The were good overall, although I've had better bacon.  My daughter's bacon was done better, so maybe they thought I wanted my bacon well done too.  The hashbrowns were great though.  My husband got some kind of omelet (I think a make your own, not sure), and the breakfast potatoes. . .after seeing my hashbrowns, he wished he'd ordered those instead because they were just ok.  For my little one, we were able to order just one pancake with bacon and they made it into a mickey shape, which she just loved.  We might be back again, I don't know . . . seems like the same food that you can get elsewhere.  I would recommend that if you decide to eat here, try to do it early.  We got there at 7:30 am, there were many people there then, but when we left after 8am, there were people waiting already.",

    "text": "We wanted brunch on the last day of our visit in Vegas and came across this place on yelp. First impression- over 200 something reviews, averaging 5 stars??! Gotta check this place out!   Customer services: A+ ( all servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Constantly checking in to see if you need your coffee refills or need anything at all. Working in the servicing industry myself, I am definitely big on customer service and satisfaction and I give the whole serving crew including the owner a 5 Stars.   Food: A ( ordered the French toast with 2 eggs, the egg Benedict with hash brown , and the Marty wrap plus 2 coffees. Food is great! It's traditional American breakfast and I say the food is actually better than some fancy restaurant that serves brunch that I have been to in LA. It's not the best I have ever had but I would say it's better than a lot of places for friction of the price. Coffee is good by the way.   Setting: B (Danny's - like setting or regular mom and pop shop. Definitely not a fancy brunch place but rather a family friendly setting and the food is pretty good. )  Price: A ( it's pretty cheap compare to places in LA ! And I purchased the $15 for $30 deal on Yelp when I came to this place so it's definitely a steal! For all that food and coffee that we ordered , our total bill came out to be less than $30 even! And of course I have actually only paid $15 for all that because of the Yelp deal. So it's a Win!!! But make sure you tip on the full price and more because these people deserve it!   Overall: A = 5 Star from me. I agree with rest of the yelp reviews that it is a great place. Will recommend and come again!",

    "text": "Drove by Mr. Mama's the other day, and recalled seeing some pretty favorable reviews.   Saturday morning, my fella and I went out for breakfast, and we chose Mr. Mama's due to its super close location, and good reviews.  Ok, the $30 for $15 Yelp Deal sealed the deal for us.   The first thing that struck me as great was that the owner greeted us,  took our name, since there was a short wait, but assured us that it would be less than 15 minutes.  It was about a 5 minute wait, which isn't bad at all.    All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly, and pleasant.   Our server was great, offering suggestions, and highlighting the specials.    We ended up ordering:  The Greek Omelette with hash browns and Texas Toast  A side of Biscuits and Gravy Clam Chowder Grits Philly Cheese steak Coffee  The good:  Free refills on the coffee, and your choice of french vanilla creamer or half and half.  I like this in a breakfast place.  I don't like to pay $2.50 a cup, when I have 2-2.5 cups...that's just too much.  So I liked the free refills option.  The Philly Cheese Steak was to DIE for.  Cooked perfectly, and perfectly seasoned.   Now,the \"not bad, but not super good\" and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  The rest of our food was bland.  It was GOOD, but it wasn't seasoned well at all.  We had to add salt and pepper to everything...clam chowder, the omelette (even with all that feta), the grits, and the hash browns.  I normally don't ever add salt or pepper to my dishes, but these needed them.   Everything else was great...the eggs were cooked perfectly, the grits were a trip back in time for me, to Nashville trips with my dad, and the biscuits and gravy were pretty good too.  We both really enjoyed the clam chowder as well.   All in all, the trip was good.  We would have liked to have had better seasoning on most of the food, but it was still good.    I'd come back, for sure.  There are lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try, and you really just can't beat the service!",

This is one of the few breakfast joints in Vegas that has excellent service, consistent efficient service, and perfectly cooked omelette, hash browns, French toast, and fluffy pancakes.   There hasn't been a wait the two times I've been to this location. I love the warm, genuine welcome from the owner. Props to one of the few mom and pop restaurants who appreciate their customers. So many restaurants lack in this simple gesture but Mr. Mama and his staff set the standard of how you should treat your customers!",

The pancake flavor was excellent but they were a little too chewy for me. The omelet was cooked a little different than way I like them but again the flavor was excellent. Both were tasty and the portions were sizable. Enjoyed the Mamas Sandwich on wheat...turkey (lots!), bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and mayo on the side.   Service was outstanding as well. They were quick, efficient, and friendly. I did not feel rushed, but I felt they were attentive.",

Located in yet another strip mall off of Jones, Mr Mamas isn't going to blow you away looking from the outside. But once you're inside, it's a whole different story. The first thing I noticed was how many locals were there. That's always a good sign in my opinion.  We got inside and were quickly seated. The menu is awesome. Tons of both breakfast and lunch options. After agonizing over what to get, I opted for the chili and cheese omelet. The chili is housemade which is what steered my decision, and lemme tell you that I didn't regret it. Mr Mamas doesn't skimp on the ingredients. My four egg omelet was loaded with peppers and cheese and the aforementioned delicious housemade chili. The home fries were no frills and had this amazing flavor to them.  Service was unbelievable. Our server constantly checked on us and the hostess at the front was making sure everyone in the dining room was taken care. The food came out quickly with no issues. I'd definitely make another Mr Mamas run just to try some of the other items on the menu. Great food and great service. I can see why this place is so highly rated. Easy five stars.",

    "text": "Mr Mamas appeared on the Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat for three years (ranked 77th 2015, 44th in 2016, and 91st in 2018) and I finally had a chance to visit this breakfast restaurant with 2,700+ reviews and an average rating of 4.5-star (as of Feb 2019.) Our party arrived at 8:15 AM on Sunday and was able to grab a table immediately. The menu is pretty overwhelming (60+ options - salads, burgers, sandwiches, chili/soup, omletes, pancakes, etc), but there is a special section called \"Mamas Favorites\" and most of Yelp highlights (corned beef hash, cinnamon roll, and chicken fried steak) are listed under this section. For beverages, free refills for coffee, iced tea, hot tea, and fountain drinks. I was pretty amused when one of my friends asked the staff for A.1. Steak Sauce because he ordered rib-eye steak and the staff told him it was not available.  ***  Mamas Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (choice steak battered and fried, covered with sausage gravy, 3 eggs, potatoes, and toast - $13.25): The order also came with hash browns (potatoes) and two slices of toasted white bread. Chicken fried steak itself was somewhat bland, but once you combine chicken fried steak with sausage gravy then this dish became pretty decent. Overall it was a very filling entree.  Cinnamon Roll ($4.50): It was slightly too sweet for my taste; however, I can see why this is a must order dish because bread tasted super fluffy.  ***  Personally I thought the service was pretty good, but my friends just wanted to get the heck out of Vegas and complained about how slow the service is (took about 20 minutes for entrees to come out of the kitchen.) While I don't necessary agree that this is the best breakfast place in Vegas (I still prefer Egg & I), food portion was generous and there's something for everyone!   P.S. - Call me crazy but I would certainly love to see Sriracha as a part of the condiment selection (salt and pepper, ketchup, Tabasco, etc.)!",

    "text": "Okay so when i first walked up i was a little nervous because not being from Vegas every new food play we try typically is just lacking one thing or another.   This is not one of those places. From the first introduction to who I'll assume was the manager or owner, because he was soooo attentive, caring and accommodating so you'd think it was his own, Shawn was the best restaurateur i have ever met and I've eaten at so really swanky places across america. Then as we were seated our waitress was there to greet us and although i don't remember her name, she was as equally accommodating as Shawn. I loved how everyone worked together and was polite like they actually love their job and those who patronize their establishment. The customer service is five stars alone.   Food: after consulting with the waitress and Shawn about what to eat i decided on the chicken fried steak, the kids of course wanted different variations of bacon eggs pancakes or French toast, my brother in law had a burger, and my sister in law exactly the same thing as me.  The chicken fried steak was BOMB. The gravy was the perfect amount of flavor and perfect consistency. The eggs were nice and fluffy, and the home fries had the perfect amount of crunch and seasoning. The batter on the chicken fried steak stayed crunchy with the gravy on it! I'd order it again and recommend it.  I also snuck little bites of the kids bacon. It was perfectly cooked. The pancakes were hot, fluffy and HUGE. All i needed was one. (And i can eat) my brother in law loved his burger. It was also HUGE. Even shit as simple as the coffee had flavor and was fresh.   I would tell anyone who is looking to find a nice inexpensive and delicious breakfast without having to sacrifice one or the other, This is your go to place!",

We ordered the french toast with bacon, short stack pancakes (2 pancakes) with chocolate chips (additional $0.50) with whipped cream and chocolate syrup and a country fried steak made with their homemade gravy with crispy hash browns, eggs and white toast. We also ordered a coffee that comes with FREE refills!  Our food came in a timely manner and it was delicious!   The hash browns were crunchy. The country fried steak with their homemade gravy was tasty. The pancakes were a bit too sweet for me, but my kids loved it! The french toast was good, crunchy on the edges soft in the middle.   Would I come here again? Absolutely!!!   *tip**  Go fairly early on the weekend otherwise expect a wait of about half an hour or so.",

The coffee tastes kinda funky. Not bad... it's just a little bitter. The food was decent. The Mushroom Swiss Burger has a great soft bun, lacked any seasoning. I had to apply a fair amount of salt to flavor it up. The fries were Greek fries. They have a different flavor, a little heavy on oil and rosemary.   The breakfast food was better, they have some fantastic sauces they use on the chicken fried steak and eggs Benedict. These were a flavorful interpretation on the norms.  Check out Mr. Mamas if you are in the area. You may be pleasantly surprised.",

There are over 2,200 review of this place and they are averaging 4.5 stars and after our meal there, it's easy to understand why.  The room was practically empty upon arrival, it was early, and everybody working there greeted us with a smile.  The manager even came over and shared a home made piece of fudge with us.....loved it.  Now, this is in a strip mall, and it was about a ten minute drive from Rio, and easy to find in the sunrise twilight using our cell directions provided by Yelp.  The food was good.  I had the 'Greek Omelet' and my wife ordered eggs benedict in a rather unique fashion.  She asked for the English muffin to be replaced with additional sauteed vegetables and the chef did a great job of taking care of her request.  Friendly attentive staff and good food is always a great recipe.  Thanks again to Yelp, never would have been here without it.",

    "text": "After a weekend of full of copious amounts of alcohol with very little oxygen, we needed some breakfast before we made the long drive back to Phoenix. On a Sunday morning at 11am in Vegas though, finding breakfast is incredibly difficult. Finally we decided to bite the bullet and wait the 30 minutes to try Mama's and we were so glad that we did!  Situated in a large strip mall, Mr Mamas doesn't seem like much, but once you see the line wrapping around the outside you quickly see that people love this place. The waiting area was super small and the dining area is massive, you just see the wait staff and host bustling about like a well oiled machine. Clearly they're used to these types of rushes and they were well prepared.   We waited for our table longer than it took us to order and pay but that was understandable when they were still seating people! The menu is all breakfast and lunch options, each sounding better than the last, hearty and delicious. My boyfriend tried the tuna melt and thought it was one of the best he'd ever had, and I got the club sandwich that must have put a butcher's kids through college with how piled high with meat it was. Both were fantastic, service was friendly and quick.   Plenty of room for large groups though likely difficult to get in if its really busy. A bit loud but thats gonna happen when there's so many people, and despite being so busy it didn't feel cramped at all once we were sat.  I sincerely wish they would open a Phoenix location :p",

They had an excellent floor manager that was orchestrating he flow of tables to be cleaned, restructured, etc.   He even provided extra chairs to some young ladies that had kiddos in their arms.  When seated they promptly took our drink orders. After that, the food order, and before an hour as up, we were out of there.  It was tasty and my kids loved their pancakes.  My favorite thing was that the place was loud so my kids could have their usual high pitched giggles and conversation without us feeling like we were standing out or disturbing other customers.  Would highly recommend others (especially families) to try this place out.",

Krystal, our waitress. explained the difference between Home Fries and hash browns to me, and noted that their country gravy is made with bacon, sausage and a touch of maple syrup.  She offered me a taste before placing my order. I declined, since it sounded tasty from her description.  Hubby's order came with an English muffin, while I chose the biscuit, using some of the ample portion of country gravy instead of jam. My scrambled eggs were perfect: not overly cooked like some lesser restaurants serve.  The hostess and several other employees (in addition to Krystal) checked to make sure we were doing okay throughout the meal. I appreciated their attentiveness.  We enjoyed a pleasant meal and felt most welcomed.",

There's even a nice gentleman who walks around and asks if you'd like him to take a photo for you (with your own cell phone).  The second time we went here we got seated in a corner behind the cash register.. and even then we still got excellent service!  Now to the food.. the home fries are delicious!  If your food comes with an option of hash browns or home fries, get the home fries!  They are so good.. lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with some sort of seasoning that makes it taste delicious.  I ordered my usual steak and eggs and my girlfriend ordered her eggs benedict.  Everything was on point.  My steak had so much flavor from the outer edges all the way to the center.  My girlfriend's eggs benedict was savory in every bite.    I'm only disappointed that we couldn't bring any leftovers home.. because we ate it all!  We'll be back again!",

My name got skipped due to wrong spelling and could not understand the writing, luckily I knew who was in front of me and behind for table. After questioning the host got it corrected right away. They sat us down fast and the service was impeccable came with a free cinnamon roll for the mistake the host did. Waitress was so attentive. Food was so good, \"it was worth the wait\". My wife and I shared the omelet and French toast. Big portions. We took an Uber from New York. Got there with 10 min.",

It's very apparent that teamwork is fostered here as they all seemed to work together and were constantly  communicating with each other. The yelp 4.5 stars is what brought us in and with almost 3k reviews thought we couldn't go wrong. Thanks for a great breakfast and amazing hospitality~",

This place fills up fast because it is fantastic. The restaurant is simple and it has quite a few tables but is not huge. The service is very friendly and very efficient. The breakfast choices are fast and there is a lot to choose from. All the choices are delicious. The pancakes here are fantastic. My omelette which was a vegetable omelette was delicious. It came with toast and I chose the house potatoes although hashbrowns are available. You can request egg whites only. The coffee is delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable and we were blown away by how affordable this place is.  If you want friendly service with great food, either for breakfast or lunch, this is the right place to do it.",

There was three of us on this trip. But let me just tell you, this place is everything more than five stars!   Our order Chicken fried steak, over easy eggs, biscuit, gravy, home style potatoes. W/ slice of orange. & a Dr Pepper. French toast, ham, scrambled eggs w/chesse, w/ slice of orange. & orange juice. Like I said there was three of us, with two orders it filled us up, and left overs.  And the gravy is so good!!!! You might need extra.  We ordered the chicken fried steak because it was recommended, and it lived up to its expectations. The French toast, had a tad bit much of cinnamon but we still ate it because it was cooked so lightly and perfectly.   Our waitress, was so friendly and nice, asked friendly questions after taking our orders, and told us to take our time after she collected our plates.   This looks like a place that wouldn't be as packed from the outside shopping center, but I think all the cars were for this place.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for a home style breakfast, with the right portion sizes.  Absolutely delicious. And away from the strip with the right prices.",

    "text": "Even though i was told this place was just ok i had to try it because I know Mr. Mamas is highly rated on yelp.   Service - 3  stars  As soon as we arrived we saw their was a wait. My initial thought was we might as well wait by the time we drive somewhere else and wait it will be the same amount of time.  Upon walking in we were not greeted however we were Aggressively asked if we wanted our name on the list, a little taken back we said yes and she said \"I don't want to tell you a time , maybe 30 minutes , it's 12:05\" we noticed right after , the unfriendly ness of the host and almost considered just leaving but we went with the flow and took in the experience.  Secondly the other Host who was obnoxiously calling names of guests across the parking lot like a mad man  sure scared  my friends along with the father and young son that were waiting a couple stores down. Not to mention he came out and asked us our name and then laughed after he said \"oh you guys are at the bottom haha sorry.\"  Probably not the best thing to say to people patiently waiting outside of your establishment.  Thirdly the other gentleman who was dropping food off to tables .....not our waitress (who by the way was very nice and attentive)   There is no need to shout out what we ordered and aggressively drop the plate on our table. Manners and being kind and polite can truly go a long way . At this point we did not care what the food was going to taste like. The people I was with truly felt intimidated. I hope the reason behind all of the aggressiveness perhaps could have been due to how busy they might have been.   3 1/2 Stars  Food Quality  I ordered the biscuits and gravy which I enjoyed.  No complaints. If you need a little kick for your biscuits and gravy you might want to add some pepper or Cholula the sausage in the gravy isn't on the spicy side which was good for me. My eggs were cooked just right.   The veggie omelette we ordered was very watery if you order it I would recommended ordering it well done!   I'm sorry we didn't enjoy the vibe and the food was just ok , i was really excited after all the pictures on yelp !  this place may Be for some folks but it just didn't do it for  us. I probably won't be back if I do it will be with the dudes !",

I had the corned beef hash, it was gritty. and salty and shredded, unfortunately it only earned three bites. At least the scrambled eggs were good :-) The cinnamon roll was fluffy but nothing more to gush about, very light on a very thin icing. I would not go out of your way to check out. Slightly sub par and deserving of only 2 stars.",

I got to this place easily and was greeted with a welcoming smile and got sat immediately. My server was very nice and knowledgeable. I got coffee and decided to order the veggie wrap with hash browns. The wrap comes with eggs in it and to my pleasant surprise, the hash browns were actually inside the wrap, which was fantastic. I got some salsa with my wrap and I ordered Pico de Gallo as well. That was actually not to my liking so I'm glad I asked for it on the side. My server, Claudia, kept filling my coffee exactly when I needed and always with a smile. When I was about to leave (around 9am) there was already a wait list. They were so nice that even when I left they asked me how it was and they hoped to see me again. They will surely see me again!",

I approached them and said hello excuse me. I did not get a response, it seems maybe no one heard me then, finally an older woman acknowledged me and put my name down. There was about a 30 minute wait. When we sat down we received really great service. Breakfast food was what you expect for breakfast. Nothing was OMG-AMAZING but nothing was bad. It was just average. If I was basing this review on the service I received after sitting down, it would be 5 stars but taking into consideration the average food and first impressions, three stars seems about right.",

They are worth it, I promise, just be patient.   Now, we always close out our trip here for breakfast. It keeps us full all the way back to Cali. The staff is friendly, efficient and all business. They make sure you're taken care of. The food is always hot, fresh and consistent. I usually get an omelette or breakfast burrito. I love hash browns and they are ALWAYS done perfect. Crispy on the outside, soft underneath. Prices are on par and and actually a bargain for what you get.   I don't know what I'm saddened by more, my trip is over or I have to wait a few months for awesome breakfast. Thanks for keeping us fed well guys!",

The wait is going to be around 15 minutes, but most likely shorter, is that okay?\" YES. He answered my question without me even asking, and we were seated in less than ten minutes.

    "text": "My boyfriend had been dying to try Mr Mamas after all the stellar reviews, praises, and high ratings. However, I'm not a breakfast type of person. I eat breakfast foods now and then but I'm not totally crazy about it like some are. I do appreciate a good omelet though.    My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday for lunch about an hour before they closed. When we got there, the whole place was packed but luckily, people were getting ready to leave. And we weren't the only ones that were coming in too. There was a couple before us and a couple of people after us as well. This just goes to show that Mr Mamas consistently has customers through the day.   My boyfriend and I decided to share the Spanish Omelet with ham, 1 slice of French Toast, and a greek yogurt parfait.   When our Spanish omelet came, I was a little confused. I could've sworn that I ordered it with ham but instead of ham, there was bacon. Granted, it was close to closing time so there might have been a mistake here or there with the kitchen rushing the orders out. I didn't say anything bout the mishap only because I didn't want to wait for it to be redone so we stuck it through. I mean, I guess bacon is sort of like ham...they're both pork. *Shrugs.* There were also hash browns that came with the omelet and we had specifically requested well done hash browns. I like my hash browns crispy on the outside and warm goodness on the inside. The hash browns did not look as well done as the pictures we've seen but it was still good nonetheless. It was probably some of the best hash browns I've had in Vegas.   I love how Mr Mamas allows you to order pancakes and French toast by the slices. I don't like pancakes but if my friend or boyfriend does, they can order just a slice or two since I won't help them eat it. As for French toast, I like them but I don't like them enough to gobble a whole order. I haven't had French toast in ages and I've almost forgotten what they taste like. French toast holds a comforting place in my heart -- I used to make them with my uncle when I was a young girl. Unfortunately, Mr Mamas does run short for their French toast. It doesn't quite bring about the comfort feelings but it is still good -- just not something I would order again. It seemed a little plain to me. I might enjoy it more if it had options for whip cream and strawberries.   Their greek yogurt parfait was beautiful and possibly my favorite order of the day. It was loaded with mixed berries and granola. It was the perfect healthy breakfast -- can't really go wrong with that!   Overall, Mr Mamas, to me, was good but not the best. Perhaps I walked in with super high expectations and with that, it's hard to satisfy me. Nothing here gave me a huge surprise and nothing made me crave for more. One of the bonus things about Mr Mamas is that it is not pricey .. definitely great to dine with a family! :)",

Their coffee is also better than average.",

I've tried the gravy, which is their specialty and I must say it is delicious.  I would like to try to chicken fried steak with gravy and eggs next time I visit Mr Mamas, it looks amazing.  On my last visit I had Mr Mamas French toast which included two large pieces of French toast cut in half accompanied by eggs and three crispy pieces of bacon which you can substitute with ham or sausage.  Excellent portion of food for the pricing and I almost finished the entire meal except for a quarter slice of French toast.  The French toast is not as battery as some places I've had but is very tasty with hints of cinnamon powder.  The atmosphere is a bit noisy as it's one large room of tables kind of close to each other but the food and service distract you from the rowdiness.  Top choice in Vegas for breakfast and lunch!",

We didn't have to wait in line, but it seemed like they were about to hit max capacity.  The seats were still wet from them wiping it down and neglecting to dry the seat with a fresh towel afterwards.    It took a good 5 minutes for our server to come to us to take our drink and food order. Our server seemed really distracted by her cell phone. At first I just assumed that they took orders on a device, but half way through our order she took out a notepad? Anywho, I ordered a eggs benedict and my friend ordered a swiss mushroom burger.   And then we waited...and waited.....and waited... I finally flagged down our server at 12:20pm and asked where our food was.  She said that the eggs took a long time (really?) and that it's coming soon.  We finally got our breakfast food at 12:25pm - 40 mins after we arrived at the restaurant. Our server didn't even seem to realize that it took so long, and obviously no apology was even offered.  The only reason that I'm giving a 2 stars is because the food was delicious! But I would probably not return due to the excessive long wait and inattentive staff.  Our check arrived promptly when we were finished and they collected it fairly promptly as well. And then we waited.....and waited.....and waited. It took another 5 mins before they got my change back to me.",

Went onto Trip Advisor and read the reviews, because a good friend of ours highly recommended this restaurant. We waited for a bit, but it's worth it. Can't wait to go back again and try different dishes with my whole Family.   Our hostess was friendly and happy, which is very inviting..People kept coming and it was a bit busy and food took a bit longer than expected, but it was yummy. Portions are very shareable. Only downfall was, nobody came by to refill our beverages. Hash browns extra crispy was a plus as well.   Date of Visit: July 15, 2017",

Our server, Jenna, took our order and got us food efficiently and kindly. Our cups were never empty. She also showed us the tag and explained the charges, which I thought was nice, thorough touch.

But on two separate occasions, found the demeanor of the owner unprofessional.  On one occasion we went for breakfast and always thought it was nice he would come round and talk to his customers, but bringing politics into it and bashing the president was awkward.  We thought it was a one off day but went there for lunch.  We found their chef had left which made me realize that their tuna was not up to par and lo and behold he stops at our table and starts with the politics.  When we go out for  meal, we want to eat and enjoy our meal and not to be made uncomfortable by talking of a topic that should not be talked about with customers.  It totally put us off and we don't go there anymore.",

The lady who picked up the call was very friendly and told me there wasn't a wait at the moment but could change any time. We got to the restaurant around 9ish and were seated right away.   Our server was Jac (Jackie) who was really attentive and nice! We asked what were recommended and favorites-chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, eggs florentine was her fave, and the omelettes. My brother and I shared the Chicken Fried Steak and my 2 sisters shared the Eggs Benedict with a side of Bacon. Food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. The bacon was also crispy just the way I like it. The hollandaise sauce on there was the right amount too.   The restaurant was clean, had TVs available (at that time it was on ESPN i think covering NFL stuff which was awesome) and the staff was really friendly!   When we left they were starting to get busy. So helpful tip would be to call ahead to know what you may expect on the wait!  I regret not trying the cinnamon roll or the french toast so that would be next on my list when I come to Vegas again!",

I ordered the mama short stack which consists of 2 huge fluffy delicious pancakes...bacon that was perfectly crispy and eggs cooked your way.  Me and the boy shared...it was more than enough. We beat the crowd so it made the experience better!! Visit this place..it will cure any hangover...it's off the strip with ample parking!",

I ordered the biscuits with gravy along with hash browns. Gravy was over seasoned with pepper and the hash brown tasted undercooked. For the prices they charge $9.75 for biscuits and gravy along with hash browns it was underwhelming. I've tasted better breakfast elsewhere with lower prices. The staff was friendly and so was the manager. The place was very clean and quaint. It does tend to get busy from 9-11am.   Average tasting food. Would I recommend? Probably not.",

We were accommodated regularly since we had a bigger party of 14 people, it's not far from the airport and it's located in a plaza so it also has good parking.   Food: 4/5 I got the chicken fried steak and it was soooooooo good! They have homemade gravy and it was one of the best ones I've had yet, I got a side of eggs and they were well done as well as their potatoes. If you get their potatoes stick to their cube potatoes, they had a crunch yet they were soft in the inside. Only reason I'm giving this a four is because my boyfriend got the steak with eggs & the steak was not good. It came out looking thin & was chewy. If you come here stay to the more popular options (chicken fried steak, eggs Benedict) I also have to compliment them on their pancake, it is huge! And their toast was the perfect amount of buttery. They do serve huge portions so I would also recommend sharing if you both don't have a big appetite.   Staff/Customer Service: They are definitely open, honest & genuine. Since we had a big party they let us know if it was okay to serve the two couples that got there before us. They wanted us to feel appreciated and I have to applaud to that. Many restaurants lack communication and at mr.mamas they treat you like family.",

Hopefully the good make up for the bad.  The food that we had was worth the wait! I loved the honesty & friendliness of all the staff there.

When we went the guy at the front (possible the owner) was on top of making sure the tables were cleaned and filled ASAP.  I was amazed that a couple of really big parties came in and were seated as quickly as we were.  We showed up 9:30ish on a Sunday and we didn't wait for more than 15 minutes.

Stopped by as we passed vegas on our way to Utah. We wanted a nice casual breakfast for a family of 7. We were greeted right away. My grandfather is handicapped and walks super slow but they made sure that he didn't have to rush which was nice. The owner mentioned he had several surgeries so he understands the struggle.   We ordered a variety of dishes to show my grandma what American breakfast is like and I think she really enjoyed it! We ordered a mr MaMa breakfast 3 pancakes, 3 eggs with sausages, veggie omelette, breakfast burrito, chicken fried steak, egg benedict, and Mr MaMa burger for 7 people.   My grandma enjoyed the Egg Benedict and was hogging it even tho we were suppose to be sharing. I enjoyed the egg veggie egg omelette because I wanted something lighter and it was perfect. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. My brother enjoyed their breakfast burrito and burgers and my dad enjoyed the chicken fried steak.   Service was great in general, they did their best to make us comfortable and feel welcomed. The coffee was constantly refilled and waiters were very tentative.    Great place to stop by for super casual breakfast or brunch when your not looking for anything fancy!  12/20/16",

The corn beef was a perfect balance of meat mix and crispness, the hash brown was flavorful and so was the toast.",

Bowl of chili - They ask if you want cheese and onions added on top for an additional charge of 35cents each. not particularly a fan of places that charge extra for toppings when it should probably just come with it. Nothing special to the chili to rave about.  Chicken fried steak with their house gravy made with sausage, bacon, and maple syrup. The gravy itself was bland. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or just how it is suppose to be because I expected more flavor out of it. The steak however was very good. Better than most breakfast joints. Such a shame that the gravy came up short.  Home fries - crispy potatoes squares topped with peppers and onions. Again the toppings cost extra. Otherwise the potatoes would have probably been too plain.  Biscuits and gravy. Half order comes with one biscuit cut in half. Topped with the same gravy. The biscuit itself was very fluffy.  The service was exceptional. I came in around noon on a Sunday and waited only 20 or so minutes. Overall, I don't see anything that stands out compared than a typical breakfast diner. I really had high expectations after seeing such high ratings but was left disappointed.",

The food was excellent the staff so friendly and accommodating! I even saw an employee step up onto a chair just so that he could get every one into a group photo. Now that is what I call service!",

I got the breakfast bowl special and my wife got eggs, hash browns, and toast. These are large portions but not vegas prices. It's so worth the trip to gear up in the morning.",

The reviews I'd seen all talked about the wait and it was worth it. We must have timed it perfect, no wait. Our waitress was very attentive but intrusive. Food was wonderful. I had the Denver Omelette with country fried and a side of salsa. The omelette was 4 eggs perfectly cooked as we're the potatoes. The salsa us fresh made every day and it tastes like it. My partner had the Eggs Benedict, perfect! The owner came over and talked to us checking on everything. Highly recommended!! We will be back next trip!",

I don't know what else you could possibly ask more from them.   As soon as I was walking up to the entrance, a server immediately opened the door for me before I even had to chance to grab on the the door handle. From then on, I knew I was going to love this place.   I wasn't wrong. They got me hooked with the food. I was able to try the choice of meat and eggs as well as the breakfast egg sandwich. Yes, I am aware that the choice of meat and eggs entree is just the deconstructed version of the sandwich BUT STILL, both are so good.   Absolutely delicious!

But again we use Yelp as a guide.  We search for the best burgers or BLTs.  On June 10, 2018, Yelp led us to try Mr. Mamas for breakfast.  We could not have been happier!  From the greeter opening the door, continuing to the owner and manager, then our extraordinary server Claudia and continuing through the sincere staff thanks as we departed, the entire team was friendly and attentive.  I had the Eggs Benedict on Daly's Applewood Thick Cut Smoked Bacon.  My husband Dave had the BLT, also with Applewood Smoked Bacon.  The food was excellent, and delivered warm and promptly.",

I go to Las Vegas at least once a year, and about 6 or 7 years ago, I discovered this place when I was DESPERATE to get off the strip and have a good meal that was not sitting under heat lamps on a groping, sneeze-infested buffet table but also wasn't going to cost me $25+ per person. I tapped into the Yelp Hive-mind, which gave Mr. Mamas rave reviews, and I immediately experienced why... Incredibly fresh food, generous portions (without being ridiculous), super friendly service, and great value. I've been back probably 10 times, with friends, with family, with clients/colleagues, and solo... I have NEVER been disappointed, and can't recommend it highly enough. Bottom line: why would anyone eat breakfast on the strip when this place is just a couple miles away...!? I never will again.  (To answer the question below: my favorite is the Jenna wrap, but I like to mix it up. Never been disappointed. My boys [ages 12 & 15] recently declared the biscuits & gravy \"the best ever!\")",

You might wait before getting seated because the place gets busy but if you want some good ole classic American breakfast and lunch. Mr. Mamas never fails!",

It was just as good as I remembered it at your old location, if not better!\" \"Wow Mike, that's sounds really terrific! What did you get?\" \"I first ordered a coffee for myself, because nothing goes better with breakfast than coffee\" \"I totally agree with you, what did you think?\" \"I liked the coffee, it was well brewed, and it did not have a bitter aftertaste\" \"I'm happy to hear that, did you order any food while you were there?\" \"As a matter of fact, I did\" \"What did you order?\" \"I wanted to start off with my favorite, eggs benedict\" \"Oh, that's my favorite as well, did you like it?\" \"I sure did. I liked that the eggs were definitely the stars of the dish. The hollandaise was well made, and the poached eggs were perfect. The canadian bacon wasn't too overpowering, and helped elevate the dish. The english muffin was fresh and crisp, just the way I likes it. Also, the hash browns on the side were crispy on the outside, and hot and creamy on the inside\" \"I'm so glad to hear that, Mike\" \"Are you really?\" \"Yes I am. Were you able to try out anything else?\" \"Yes, I wanted to see how your pancake and french toast stacked up\" \"And how was that?\" \"The pancake had a light and delicate texture, and wasn't too sweet. Honestly, one of the best pancakes I've ever had!\" \"Mmmm, pancakes\" \"I know, that's what I said!\" \"How did you like the French toast?\" \"Once again, it was great! It was thick, and wasn't soggy or dry, and the custard had a slight cinnamon taste that I enjoyed\" \"How was the service, Mike?\" \"What can I say? My server, Abby, was a complete rock star, friendly and helpful, can't ask for much more than that\" \"Now I gotta ask you, Mike.. How come this wasn't a five star review? Everything seemed to be pointing in that direction\" \"Well, there were a couple of minor issues. First, for some of the items, specifically the hash browns and the grits, I thought that they could have been seasoned a bit more aggressively. But, since there was a salt shaker at the table, that was easily remedied\" \"And what else?\" \"I ordered a burger medium rare and it came out mid-well. Plus, I didn't like the bun too much, it was a bit too squishy for my taste buds\" \"Ah, I see\" \"But I loved everything else, and this probably my favorite breakfast spot here in Vegas, and I will definitely come back!\" \"Great! Can't wait to see you\" \"Oh, and another thing\" \"What's that, Mike?\" \"Nah, I can't\" \"It's ok, you can tell me\" \"Nah, can't say it\" \"Mike it's fine, just tell me, I want to know\" \"I can't, because I forgot what I was going to say\" \"....\"  Fin",

Simple place with a solid breakfast/brunch menu, great service (who still opens the door for you and greets you as part of the standard sequence of service? They do and it is a nice touch) and food quality was on point. Was seated quickly, approached with out a wait by Alex the server, received some menu suggestions based off of a few quick questions, seamlessly placed my order and received my order within minutes. I have waited longer at fast food restaurants for my order in the past. The Corned Beef Hash was very good, house made, full of flavor; my only suggestion would be to have a texture component (a crisp seared crust would have sent it over the top, but don't get me wrong, it is a destination menu item as is).  Doing a great job team Mr. Mama's, I will be back.",

Very friendly service.  Cons: pancakes tastes like Denny's and sausage is identical to McDonald's. The home fries were very strange.... Huge slices of fried potato and we ask for bell peppers and onions with it and they just dump it on top? No cooking it with it for flavor?   I'd skip this place if I were you.",

Place was full but we were able to get a seat pretty quickly, as it appears they turn the tables around pretty quickly.  There's really nothing to this place from decor standpoint, in fact purely from the looks of the interior it's tough to expect a lot out of it.  Six of us sat and ordered a variety of stuff.  I would say from food standpoint it was as good as any excellent breakfast joints.  Service was great with staff that seems to enjoy working there, including the very enthusiastic owner who ups the mood of the whole diner with his running around and conversations.  It's really the highlight of this place.  With prices also being reasonable, I would come here again if I happen to be in the area or if I'm heading out for breakfast with mum & bro, since it's near their place.  And therein lies my 4-star rating, instead of 5.  If I'm in the mood to go out for breakfast, am I thinking immediately, \"I want to drive 20 minutes to go to Mr. Mamas\"?  Well, no.  I guess that's why it's a 4 - good food, great service, fine atmosphere, but what's that above-and-beyond that makes me want to go out of my way to come back?  Still, a fine breakfast establishment.  Table-for-1 Factor:  Question isn't whether it's appropriate, it's whether they have seats.",

I will say the service was amazing and the staff is super nice and attentive, they had one major pitfall for me...their country gravy. A friend and I split a bunch of stuff and I just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be. Their breakfast sandwich was good and so were their potatoes. Their chicken noodle soup was a bit salty. But it was really the country gravy I was most disappointed in. I like to consider myself somewhat of a gravy expert and there was just no flavor to it. Definitely very meaty, which I could appreciate, but sill lackluster in seasoning. I definitely was not dazzled.",

    "text": "Mr. Mamas is the all american breakfast restaurant. That solid breakfast that you can go enjoy with your family before the start of a big soccer tournament or with your buddies after a night of smash mouth karaoke.  You initially get thrown off by the limo tint windows that may make you feel like you're walking into a secret sex shop but do not be deceived as Mr. Mama himself is likely to open the door for you  Inviting service, during your visit the owners will prove to you that they care about the quality of their business. Our waitress was very nice and you can tell that they only hire people that enjoy their job and carry around a positive attitude. (+)  The menu is quite provincial. In an area with so many glittery things it's refreshing to see 1+1=2.   California Omelette: I came here on my morning of departure, so what better way to transition from state to state than by ordering this? Large portion 4 egg omelette. The ingredients were fresh, the hash browns were thinned out enough for it to not feel like finishing them was homework. 4/5  French Toast: Normal french toast. No special bread or an over glamorized batter, but once again it was good enough to where that's all you needed. 3.5/5  Mr. Mamas is like a gateway computer, a super nintendo, a motorola flip phone...it's fulfills the basic needs. When you don't want the serendipity's of the world and want pancakes and eggs, they will be here for you.",

I am always looking for restaurants that the locals go to whenever I travel. The atmosphere gives you a nice cozy diner feel and  everyone greats you with a smile when you walk through the door. I don't like eggs but I'm trying to eat healthier these days so I decided to get out of my comfort zone & I had the Cali Omelette with egg whites, home fries & an English muffin. The omelette was really good & filling but the star of the meal for me was the home fries! They were cooked very well & seasoned to perfection. I highly recommend going here if you want to get away from the tourist traps on the strip. I will definitely return whenever I am back in town.",

The coffee is some of the best we've had at a restaurant. It's got a good kick and they kept it coming. You can have options like mocha and other things if you want.   We opted for the eggs Florentine and the Mr. Mama's Favorite Chicken Fried steak. Both were good with distinct flavors and crispy potatoes. We had the hash browns and the home fries. The portions are huge and we took food home.   The whole staff is super friendly and very proactive in making sure we had everything we needed. The manager even offered us To Go coffee or water.   I knocked off a half a star because it was loud in the place and, interestingly, the poached egg on the chicken fried steak order was cold. But we'll be back. I want to try their ginormous pancakes.",

My Mom is elderly and we had to park a little bit away from the door. When we got there he made sure we got the closest available table so she didn't have to walk then helped me get a parking spot closer to there door. The waitress was very courteous and attentive. When it was time to leave he even allowed us to use the emergency exit because it was closer to where we were parked! I will be back. Thank you for the excellent service and food!!",

    "text": "So today I went to mr. Mama's for the very time I usually eat at The Hash House but my friend said he knew of a spot that was supposed to be good so we went to mr. Mamas. So this is how it went , first off there is plenty of parking because it's in a shopping plaza. There were people waiting outside of the restaurant waiting to be seated, as soon as you go to the door they greet you which was a  breath of fresh air seeing that customer service still exist,  we got there around 8 30 a.m. and we were told there was a 30 minute wait we put our names down and we got called in within 10 minutes which was great. The menus are very simple, the waitress that was helping us was very helpful and helping us choose and breakfast being that everything on the menu looks so good so it was so hard to choose one. I ended up getting a chili cheese omelette with hash browns and my friend.got a Jenna wrap all I can say is the  food was good, I would definitely recommend  this place",

They have pancakes, omelets, eggs, breakfast wraps, sandwiches, soups, salads and beverages , of course...  I found this place on Yelp and read the good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.  After trying I can say that there is nothing special or spectacular about this place. Prices are reasonable, of course, but the food was not perfect or exciting as I expected.  I tried the Western omelet with mushrooms, sausage, green peppers and onions. Well, not bad, but something was missing for me that even Tabasco sauce wasn't able to fulfill.   Overall ,not bad.

He opened the door for us and gave us the warmest welcoming. The service was A+ I can tell they're run by family business. The food was AMAZEBALLS as well! I wasn't too crazy about the biscuit over gravy, but other than that rest of the food and service A+ if you're in town or in the area, don't think twice and come visit this place. Plus, price is inexpensive for good food.",

    "text": "Good and the kinda bad - This place is only a couple of minutes from my house. I don't know why I didn't try it sooner. Breakfast - chicken fried steak and eggs. VERY good. They make it themselves -- most other places use frozen chicken fried steak. Two of my favorites are Black Bear Diner and Peggy Sue's (I-15 just north of Barstow). This is right up there. Service is fantastic and friendly. My 2nd visit was for lunch. Had the tuna melt. There are three primary food items I judge a restaurant by - chicken fried steak; meatloaf; tuna melt. I was a disappointed in this one primarily because the tuna was very cool (almost cold in places). By definition, a tuna \"melt\" should be at least very warm, if not hot. I don't expect 'cool' tuna when I bite into a melt. The cheese wasn't as melted as it should have been. Granted, the tuna itself was excellent, but I didn't order a cold tuna sandwich. This is so basic that even I could make a decent acceptable one. IF it had been hot (or at least warm) I would likely have given 5 stars. It just barely makes 4 because, as picky as it might sound, I expect my tuna 'melt' to be hot enough to 'melt' the cheese.",

There is no music playing, which I personally do not prefer in a restaurant around 6 am, but a low volume tv with subtitles broadcasts news. The special was blackberry french toast, which had a distinct cinnamon flavor (an improvement to the typically low cinnamon and higher sugar or butter flavor to some french toast dishes) complimented by the sweetness of whipped cream dollops and fresh blackberries. The owner creates a hometown feel with an appreciation of his customers. I think that with a little Forbes 500 training, this restaurant would skyrocket; the recipe is certainly present!

They certainly don't skimp on the bacon and avocado! that drives me crazy when restaurants skimp on bacon or avocado that they charge at least $1.00 or more. Fruit bowl was fresh, colorful and full of variety... The iced tea was very good too. I definitely see this becoming my regular breakfast joint!",

As we arrived a staff member opened the door for us and we were seated immediately. There were two gentlemen waiting at the table,  one even pulled or the chair for me and got us or drink orders right away.  Or server came by shortly after and took our food orders. Was nice to have staff come by randomly ask if we were ok and refilled our drinks.  Food came out quick,  one of the team members climbed on a chair to take a group photo of us and our food.  Finally the food, i had the chicken fried steak with a sausage gravy l, came with 3 eggs,  choice of toast and potato. Cost 10 and some change, for the amount of food you get it was a great price! Was delicious and probably one of the best fried steaks I've had.  My boyfriend had the steak and eggs was cooked just how he asked for it and was also tasty. I would recommend this place especially for people from out of town.",

The hosts at the front door were friendly and efficient. Once we were seated, the experience just got better. Lourdes was our server. She was friendly, helpful and attentive without being too overbearing. The food was reasonably priced, fresh and absolutely delicious. The owner was also friendly, making his rounds to greet and check on customers. Everyone in the place looked happy. Although our hotel was located on the strip, we did not want to spend a fortune on all our meals while visiting Las Vegas. This seems to be a place where a lot of tourists come to visit. I overheard the couple sitting next to us mention that they were from Chicago. Also, as we were leaving, there were two guys with suitcases standing outside, waiting to be seated. My visit to Mr. Mama's was by far, one of the THE BEST dining experiences I've ever had. If I am ever again in Las Vegas, I will be sure to pay this place another visit. GO! You won't be disappointed.",

My husband didn't have the same problem) and they had good portions at an excellent price. We'll definitely be back next time we're in town. They were very accommodating when we came in later than our group and set us up right away. It was a plus that they even set up a chair for my car seat without even asking! Very thoughtful. We always have to be after people to set something up. I think the friendly service is what made this place for me!",

Here are my honest feelings:  \"Blown away?\"  No.  \"Best breakfast in Las Vegas or anywhere?\"  No.  Mr. Mamas is a good, American style diner with good, albeit generic, breakfasts.  Nothing special, but good.  I had eggs with sausage patties and a biscuit.  My wife had poached eggs with bacon and my son had a pancake with a side of bacon.  I have no complaints at all with the food.  All served piping hot and exactly how we ordered them.  Eggs were perfect and my son's pancaked with huge and very fluffy and the service was great.  But again, when I see words like \"blown away\" and \"best\" this means (to me) something a step above ordinary...  Something special...  Diners Drive-ins and Dives type of place.    So, great neighborhood diner.  Good breakfast at a reasonable price.  Destination...  Only if I'm in that part of town.  Not worth driving out of my way for.",

I will continue to give my praise to this restaurant and hopefully I'll come back very soon. Keep up the awesome work!",

Why so long...I do t really have anything fun to explain why, but the wait was well worth it to me.    This is a family owned establishment, and they are all about making you feel like family.  While we sat for a table one of the owners made sure to converse with us and it was genuine and entertaining.  For the service alone I would go back again and again.    The food was good too...fluffy pancakes, great wraps, burgers done really well.  This place is not fancy and you will not find truffle oil on anything, but you will be full, happy, and in a truly wonderful state of mind when you leave.  If you are a tourist please try it if even just to get away from the strip for a couple of hours.  If you are a local I am jealous.  Take care of them because they William definitely take care of you.",

Even the prices are VERY reasonable.  Thank you Nick and Claudia and your amazing cooks!!  Chris & Kim.",

Nick (Mr. Mama himself) presented a very pleasant greeting the second we walked in.  For vegas, that's difficult to find.  The staff seemed very pleasant.  As I noticed nick interacting with other customers,  he, as well as the staff were genuine and very nice.   The food was very good.  I had the Manhattan burger and I was very satisfied.  I do wish I ordered the corned beef hash as I found later that it looked really good and that its home made.  My girl ordered the French toast.  She was also happy with the flavor and portions.   I will undoubtably recommend this establishment to all friends and family coming here.  And I will return to this place time and time again every time I visit vegas.

The menu is not too complicated, and typical breakfast fare is served here, yet this place still manages to stands out and be memorable.  The first time I came here, I had the chili and it was probably the best chili I've ever had.  I've had the omelets and french toast as well and they're delicious.  Mr. Mamas goes above and beyond when it comes to customer service too. Before I even entered the restaurant, the owners came out to greet me and hold the door open.  At the old location, the wait time was pretty long, but the two times that I have been to Mr. Mamas since it opened in the new location, I haven't had to wait for a table.    When we were eating, my brother noticed a family with a young toddler walking towards the restaurant, and he saw that the owners and workers were anticipating the family's arrival and were already setting up a booster seat for the child before the family walked through the door!",

The scrambled eggs and the western omelet we ordered both had an orange garnish which gave the eggs a light and subtle orange flavor which was very nice.

I had to work soon so I felt the need to ask the host to inform our server that we're sort of in a hurry. Instead of trying to come off understanding, he said \"next time, you should come earlier if you're in a hurry since this is a sit down, relax-type of establishment\". We drove even further away from my work just to try this place after reading the reviews so I even had less time...but did I want this bad taste in my mouth before my meal? How about, \"sure, I'll let the serve know\". Honestly, had it not been for the servers attentiveness and quick service, I would not have been able to make it to work in a more positive mood. The food was okay, nothing to rave about, but that's Vegas. You pretty much get the same thing everywhere, nothing is THAT special. I enjoyed the coffee and the meal, but I just wish I wouldn't have eaten my food in such an angry state. Don't lecture me about my punctuality to your establishment and learn some customer service. Anyways, we also came at the perfect time because we were pretty much seated right away and there was a rush of humans upon our departure.  Honestly would like to rate the server a 5 and that host a 0. The food wasn't something to rave about, but that could have been due to that foul taste in my mouth. Would I try again? Maybe. It IS much further than a lot of breakfast establishments near me..",

Once the order was placed, the food came out quickly. There was a small hiccup in the delivery of food. My wife asked for fruit instead of hash browns but the error was quickly fixed. The breakfast was delicious! Our waitress was able to refill drinks before they were empty and without being asked. It is very apparent that this place has great management and great employees to make this place run smooth.",

I got the Ham and eggs with potatoes such great flavor!  The iced tea was also fresh tasting and refreshing.

My friend had the country fried chicken steak, it tastes different and a bit weird. It's s nice try but may not be a constant option.

It is by far the best sausage/bacon/gravy I have had.  Get sourdough bread.....bite the bread and notice it tastes a bit different.....because it's actual sourdough and not white bread masquerading as sourdough.

Yesss, mr mamas is packed with eye candy hunny... with all due respect of course! The decor simple 50s diner vibes.  Very busy, in this case a good sign,  never have enjoyed brunch with a side of crickets.  As for the food we ordered ribeye and eggs, hash with peppers and onions, French toast,  and bacon.  With the best first French toast was totally my favorite.  Really well executed and delicious,  eggs cooked a bit under what id desired as was the steak over. For the worst.... which really isn't so bad my hash browns. You know how some restaurants hash is sort of like hash on the outside but mash on the inside? Yes thats what those were. It was not enough to make me change my mind about the awesomeness of this place though.  Id still highly recommend it to anyone.  Cant wait to come back and  try more!",

My parents said they have to come back every time they're in town now. The only complaint I have is the table we were seated at was near the hostess stand so there was always a ton of people standing near the table waiting to get seated. And it wasn't far from the door so on a cold day like today it was very chilly with the air coming in every time the door opened. The food and the service definitely made up for that!",

    "text": "This place was highly recommended and unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. This was a good basic breakfast spot. No frills or thrills. If I could give half stars, my rating would have been a 3.5.  I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon. The eggs were cooked perfectly but my bacon was burned and my potatoes were way too salty.   I arrived just past 8 am on a Saturday and had no problem snagging a table. Shortly after I was seated I did notice that the restaurant started filling up quickly. Around 9 am there was a decent waiting line and the place was packed. So, the folks in Vegas definitely like this place.  If you're looking for a decent basic breakfast spot give this place a try. The prices are reasonable, the service was fast and the food was good.   Happy eating.",

When we were confused between 2 dishes and gave us a sampler of one of them to help us decide. Our server Jose was attentive and very patient even though we went there almost close to their closing time. Now the food.. the food portion is extremely generous  and tastes amazing.. my husband and I ordered the beef hash and friend chicken steak &eggs..both of these were amazing and filling.. Overall it's an amazing place with extremely warm people ( which is so rare to find) and I can't wait to go back and explore their menu..",

When I have a comfort food craving we just head down to the best cozy breakfast spot in town.  I normally don't change my mind on menu options. I always go for the French toast.  I thumbed through the menu to see the favorites listed.  I went with the breakfast burrito with bacon.  It had green and red peppers, onions, scrambled eggs and potatoes.  Definitely my new favorite!  It reminds me of home fries from Rhode Island.  Sometimes the wait can be 45 minutes to an hour on weekends. Get here before your hunger strikes! By the time you have a table you will be hungry if you aren't already.",

It's a family-owned and operated restaurant. The manager is the same one that was here the first time we came over 2 years ago. Our server this time was Jenna, the owner's daughter. The service was truly outstanding. Coffee cups would never allowed to get empty. Water glasses never got less than half full. I ordered the Monterey chicken omelette. It's not on the menu but worth asking for. Chicken spinach avocado cheddar cheese mushrooms and more in the omelette. Truly outstanding. My wife had the Mr Mama's short stack which includes two humongous pancakes, a side of scrambled eggs, and bacon. Very filling but somewhat disappointing. Hence 4 stars instead of 5.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place since we moved here in January. Finally made it happen for a brunch date with thd hubby.  We got the reuben, country fried steak and a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy. The reuben was delicious. We also got it with onion rings which was fantastic as well. The country fried steak was ok.. the batter was falling off and the gravy was way to thick. Wasnt a saucy kind of gravy which we like with clumps. It almost needed more milk or it was sitting out for awhile. The biscuits were too dry for us and the gravy was again thick.   I think service from our server wasn't the greatest. She was rushing us. We got our food and on her 2nd visit asked us if we were done and needed boxes?? Umm we just got our food girl! Calm down. Then she took forever to get our check and run payment. Service from everyone else was great. The guy with tattoos working the front with the clipboard was amazing, so awesome and helpful. The bussers kept clearing our plates and one busser with glasses was the bomb. He got us our boxes and also refilled our coffee everytime. Like he legit was our server instead of the girl.  The owner was awesome, we heard him talk to other tables and he was funny. Though he didn't stop by our table which is fine he seemed like a genuine guy and i loved that he was so nice to everyone. You don't see that much often.   We would come back and try some other stuff but just pray we got a better server!",

We were sat at a table right away, our waitress was there waiting on us to take our drink order. The menu was simple, which I loved. I had the biscuits and gravy which turned out to be a great choice. Two homemade biscuits slathered in gravy and sausage with a hint of syrup. Absolutely delicious!

It was a busy Sunday...that's a given, but the fact that they acknowledge you as a hungry customer and consistently follow up with you to make sure that your meal and dining experience is positive, makes you appreciate their service.  And you can tell that they care about their customers too!",

This place is about 3 miles off strip but easy to find and lots of convenient parking. We arrived at 7:30 am on a Saturday morning and the OWNER opened the door for us and greeted us. Ample, standard dinner seating and before long we had coffee, had examined the menu, and were ordering. The waitress said the Cali Omelet was their most popular item so I gave it a try.   Our coffee cups never went empty while we waited for food. My Cali Omelet was perfectly prepared and yummy - better than I expected. My daughter had the Denver Omelet and was equally pleased. The only part of the food not \"good as it gets\" was the toast - I've had better at Reno places that get their bread from Truckee bakery.   While we were their the cook brought out samples of the daily specials for the staff to examine and take pictures of. We could hear him describing his dishes to the owner and staff and he took great pride in his food.   We were asked several times how we were doing, including by the owner. I told him I found him on Yelp! where he was rated #2 and complimented him on his operation. He told me that while he appreciates the high rating he knows ratings are fleeting and he tries to operate everyday as if they were still trying to get to the top. It shows - the service and overall operations was truly impressive.   I highly recommend this place if you find yourself in Vegas looking for a great place to have breakfast. Make sure to arrive early - the owner told me that after 9 am on a Saturday the wait time approaches 1 hour.",

I love finding places off the beaten path that are surprisingly good and unique. This place is neither of these. The food was mediocre at best and I wasn't impressed with the service. I really wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt but I really couldn't.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were burnt and the gravy was so congealed and cold it was like eating a chunk of lard over store-bought biscuits. I do have to admit that it was a good try but kind of missed the mark.  My wife and kids ordered pancakes and bacon with eggs. The pancakes were decent but nothing special. They are literally in love with bacon but none of them could finish their bacon because it was burnt so crisp it was inedible.   I really am sorry to not be able to give them a higher rating but this is my honest review. If you want to give a new place a try then come but don't get your expectations too high.",

Not trying to order like a crazy person in front of him and undo the work I just did so I tend to stick with the Greek Omelet with feta cheese, onion, spinach, tomatoes, and garlic.  On the menu this would be a four egg omelet but I always get one egg and the rest egg whites, fruit instead of potatoes and dry toast.  Not super exciting but the service is always 5 star and I appreciate being able to make substitutions to my meal so in that regard they are very accommodating.   One day I hope to try one of the cinnamon rolls that seem to be so popular.",

The cinnamon roll was probably one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. The eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce as well. Cali omelette was good but not great. I was a bit disappointed in the sausage and gravy. Sausage and gravy is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch dishes. The portion was good but to me the gravy lacked a bit in flavor. I gave a 3 in cleanliness just because I'm not a fan of employees eating when guests are around. Would come back though.  Food - 4 Service - 5 Ambiance - 5 Cleanliness - 3",

Biscuits and gravy had a nice gravy that was unique, but the flavor was bland and the biscuit was super super dry.    Felt like breakfast purgatory.  Nothing good, nothing terrible. Just breakfast. Feel like I would have rather been on the road home rather than eat here.    The staff is super nice, service was great.  Just the food was average at best.  Can't imagine why the Yelp reviews are so high. The place just isn't that shockingly good how people make it seem.   Honestly two stars for food with a bonus star because the people were so sweet.

Our meal also came with crispy hash browns and toast on the side but we were able to switch out toast for french toast for a small price difference. Everything was generously portioned. Food needed a bit of extra seasoning like pepper on the hash browns & Tabasco on the omelette but that's okay. I read other reviews people saying food is \"bland.\" I can't see how breakfast food can be any different or better from what they serve at Mr. Mama's. Seasoning is provided on table anyways for your liking. Compared to places like Egg Works , Mr. Mama's wins for breakfast :)",

Drove about 10 mins from The Luxor, real easy to find. Wasnt crowded, a gentleman opened the door for us and greeted us with a smile and a joke hahaha. Cool guy. Ambience was perfect. Sit anywhere you want. Everything clean and the best part? Someone is a Denver Broncos fan! Waitress was very courteous, ensured our coffee were filled. I ordered the Marty wrap which includes eggs cheese bacon avocado onions tomato. The portion was huge. The quality was almost on point. Eggs fluffy, cheese just right. The only draw back was the bacon. Wasnt much of it. Shouldnt been diced, should be long length, avocado wasnt enough, only on one half of the wrap. But it was delicious. The hubby had mushroom and cheese omelet. It was massive. Hashbrown were perfectly crisp on the outside. Fabulous. All in all it was well recommended. Loved it and it will be on my list again when we return to Vegas, which is often....ALOHA",

I say, \"I don't care because I'm a fan!\" I started going to Mr. Mamas at their original location and I've gotten my whole family to love Mr. Mamas too.   Here are all the pros: 1) There is hardly any wait even when you roll in at 9am on a Saturday morning! From where I live, there is always usually a wait! You'd be lucky to wait for only 20 minutes and not 60!   2) The food is never bad. It's not the most creative in flavor, taste and presentation, but it always leaves me full AND the portions are generous! My mom and I always share an entree and we can barely finish ours especially since you get so much bread too.  3) The value and the prices are fantastic! For four people, three entrees and two coffees, our bill was $32.44!! That's $8.11/pp!   4) The service is always good! The owner is friendly, personable, and thanks you for being a customer! I had a wedding album to show off to one of the members in our party and he overheard that we just got married so after we were done eating, he gave us a complimentary cinnamon roll and it was so damn nice, so damn good, and so damn free!!  So don't visit Mr.Mamas looking for the best breakfast in flavor and creativity. Come to Mr. Mamas for the value, service and convenience!",

Loved the fact that Cholula hot sauce was on the table and boy was this the most delicious wrap that I've ever had! No bacon, sausage or ham up in this though it tasted as if there was. SO DELICIOUS!  Coffee was ordered and refilled constantly thanks to the superb service of this establishment and our super waitress - CATHY! She's on point and takes care of you. We really didn't need to ask for anything.  Anyways, I'm more than willing to leave the strip every time I go to Vegas just to have my breakfast here!  A MUST HOLLA!",

Everything being so expensive around our hotel, on our last day we looked up a few breakfast places outside the strip and Mr.Mamas seemed the most recommended. As we arrived, the door was opened for us by a charming lady. We waited about thirty minutes for a table, but all worth it. When seated, the waitress took our drink orders right away and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. With so many options, it was a tough choice, so we order a few things from the menu and shared, which was great because there portions are big. The restaurant was packed but everyone working there seemed like they knew what they we're doing. The restaurant was clean, and the food was delicious. Overall my family really enjoyed this place!

Standouts: Fresh squeezed OJ Pancakes French toast Fluffy eggs and omelettes  Definitely would try again!",

We had the biscuits and gravy and a taco salad. No one came by to check on us after the food was delivered. Our server was ok, as was the food. We had to wave someone down for a refill. I ordered iced tea no lemon, and got a lemon. Not a big deal.  My boyfriend said the biscuits and gravy tasted like they came from a can. The biscuits are more crumbly than fluffy. Pepsi products in the fountain. Taco salad was average, I wouldn't call it good. They serve it with unseasoned red beans, which is weird to me. Other than that, it was pretty good. The lettuce was fresh romaine.   Maybe we caught them on an off day or they are stronger at breakfast time. I am not in a hurry to go back but I wouldn't refuse if someone else really wanted to eat there.  Loved how friendly the host was.",

They had a Saint Patrick's Day special going on that came with a corned beef hash eggs benedict and choice of hash browns/home fries with a deep fried cinnamon roll, which is what my friend ordered. Yes, you read that correctly. Deep. Fried. Cinnamon. Roll. It was amazing, crunchy, and the kind of sugar rush I needed for the early afternoon. They even dressed it up with a drizzle of green icing for a festive touch. I ordered a French toast breakfast with eggs and sausage. They let me add strawberries and whipped cream for an additional $1. Everything was delicious. Breakfast food is my favorite comfort food and man, does this place do it justice not just with the food, but with their friendly atmosphere as well. Very impressed.",

From the host to the servers, their service was impeccable. They are accommodating and friendly. The cinnamon roll is a must. Absolutely delicious!  I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. The chicken breast was hot and grilled.  The dressing is thick and tasty. The salad was enough for two people.  The fries are delicious. I loved them. No crispy coating. I hate that. Please keep the fries the same. They refill your drink without asking. They clear the plates without asking. They are open from 6am - 3:00pm Monday- Friday. 7:00-3:00 on Saturday/Sunday. A must visit when you come to Vegas!!! Located in the shopping center on Jones and Russell. Close to the Orleans casino. When people are willing to wait, the food is good.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here for brunch on Sunday when we were in Vegas.  We were starving and wanted to stay away from the crowds on the strip.  We got here around 10:30 and the place was packed.  We were quoted a wait of an hour, but it ended up being closer to 30 minutes.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The menu is extensive so everyone should be able to find something they want to eat here.  My friend and I ordered the same thing - coffee, a cali omelette, and a cinnamon roll.  The omelettes are huge and made with 4 eggs.  They also come with hash browns or crispy potatoes and either toast or a pancake.  I opted for the hash browns and pancake.  The omelette was tasty and included sausage, cheese, avocado, and pico (I ordered it without sour cream).  The hash browns were well cooked - crispy on the outside but not overdone.  The pancake was tasty but nothing special.  The cinnamon roll was tasty but a tiny bit dry.  I would still recommending getting one though.  It seems based on the reviews here that most people order one.  The prices were pretty reasonable given the quantity and quality of the food.  For everything that we ordered, our bills were only around $20 each before tip.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area.",

We may have arrived at the perfect time since there was no wait, we were seated right away. The 5 people that tended to our table provided excellent service. Definitely great team work at Mr Mamas. We ordered the Mama's breakfast burrito, Mamas Stack pancake breakfast, and a breakfast wrap \"Marty's Wrap\"... It had eggs, potatoes, bacon, pepper jack cheese, tomato and AVOCADO!! Everything was super delicious. The coffee was spot on good and my cup was never empty. I would definitely return to Mr Mamas again and suggest you pay them a visit too.  By the way, the hot cakes were HUGE!!  ENJOY!",

The hostess was very friendly and seated us right away and welcomed us.  The waiter came over and he was super friendly and efficient.  Our breakfast came out quick fresh and hot so kudos to the chefs. The manager came over and asked us how our meal was, which was nice.  I took one star away was because for whatever reason, we kind of felt rushed. Maybe because we were seated by the front door. Not sure why but we felt like we had to hurry.  Other than that... an amazing place to get some really good breakfast with friendly people.  Will recommend. Two thumbs up.",

Just really great breakfast food served by the friendliest staff.  We're talking crispy hash browns, perfectly poached eggs atop toasted English muffins with a dollop of rich, not to tart hollandaise sauce, fluffy made from scratch pancakes, flaky on the outside moist on the inside biscuits, and hand pulled, spice flavor packed corned beef hash.  An everyday cup of Joe to wash it down. Nothing fancy but everything correct.  Service is exceptionally friendly. Not over-the-top but comfortable and welcoming.  Off Strip pricing.  Straightforward, solid, zero complaints. An excellent choice for breakfast off the Strip.",

It was way much better than any popular diner like Denny's or even IHOP. We will come again for sure.",

Fast friendly service, great food and atmosphere reminded me of when we used to hit up local diners in NYC, so kind of homey for us in a transplant kind of way. Also, fruit was super fresh and not weird tasting like it had been sitting or sprayed with anything.

You feel like family from the moment you walk through the door.   They were very busy and we had to wait 25 mins to be seated, which was not a problem. Once we sat down, we were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our drink order. A couple minutes later we met our server. Our food came out rather quickly and trust me it did not disappoint!! My omelet was fluffy and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak... the crunch on that steak was perfect!   Some of the best customer service I have EVER experienced. At one point my boyfriend dropped his fork and at least 4 workers were there to remedy the situation. My coffee never went cold. The conversation with multiple employees was effortless. I am more than impressed with this place.   Trust me it is my new spot and I will be introducing it to my family and friends. Amazing job Mr. Mamas!!",

Wait time is slight but front of the house has got it skillfully covered as they move tables, and people, to get you in, feed, and out the door in a timely manner. They offer all your basics that you'll want to see on an all day breakfast menu and skip the upscale and fancy touches. This is basic corn beef hash that's grated not shredded. Big egg omelets with the WHITE and YELLOW parts. Get my drift? Come on in, grab a seat and chow down!",

We didn't have to wait that long and when my husband thanked their manager (a woman who works the entire dining room floor making sure it runs smoothly), she appreciated his kind words and exclaimed \"get that man a cinnamon roll!\"  To our surprise, a fresh cinnamon roll was delivered within 1-2 minutes. The service was unparalleled. The food was very delicious. My husband had chicken fried steak, we sampled a cup of chili that makes me wish I could order it from my home in California. The French toast was decent, but I don't think it was anything extraordinary compared to other breakfast places.

    "text": "Clearly, this is the place to be off-off the strip. I mean, we were departing soon and had enough of the Vegas parking lots and parking tickets and remembering space numbers. We didn't want to fight crowds and wait an hour. We just needed some food to fuel the day.  Well, we showed up and it was super busy! Monday after July 4th and everybody and their cousin was online for this spot and I can see why. We waited and were rather entertained by the (owner, likely) man with the plan. He took names, helped people understand the real time wait, which was legit. He even said to a couple, as they shuttered at the hour wait time \"you can get back in your car, drive all over town and an hour later, maybe find a table. Or you can just wait and chill.\" They waited and they didn't chill. HAHA.  Our waitress is clearly a star and I wish WISH I could remember her name. She was fast, knew the entire menu inside and out and also, had some advice on the specials. I was not sure if I should get the corned beef hash or not, considering I had it at Mon Ami the day before, so she went and got a sample so I could try it and. That's exceptional, above and beyond service in my book!  Considering how busy they were, the food came out fast and it was cooked well. Over medium eggs were in fact, over medium. Well, strike that. Mine were and my wife had a messy slightly under cooked egg. Not the end of the world.   Pancakes were fluffy and not doughy, flavorful AND the server wipes the syrup bottle each time, before they bring it to the table. (That's a management hack right there) The space was clean, well managed, servers were communicating very well. Our table was next to the kitchen and I could see the servers discussing orders with the cooks and making sure everything was correct, BEFORE it hit the table. That's another start in the management portfolio folks. Attention to detail, at a diner a burger joint or a fine dining spot, is commendable.   LOVE this spot and will be back next time we are in town.",

The server seemed a little bit overwhelmed by the volume but was still attentive. Very charismatic and professional. The food was great portions and very delicious. The French toast was about what I expected but the taste was superb. I think they should have tried to combined things so we didn't have so many plates but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.",

We decided to wait, because if people were willing to wait in 100 degree weather then they must be doing something right inside. Boy am I glad we waited! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with my choice of Canadian bacon which was tasty, but my friend ordered the chicken fried steak that I had a few bites of and it was DELICIOUS! I will be coming back just for that next time! I also ordered orange juice which was very good, I believe it's fresh squeezed. And I ordered a side of hash browns. I love that they ask if you want it crispy cause I love crunchy hash browns. It was cooked to perfection. Service was great too.",

I had an eggs Benedict with bacon, and my boyfriend the biscuits and sausage gravy. Phenomenal. They were smothered in the perfect amount of hollandaise and gravy, and had the best crunch of the muffins and biscuits. I finished my plate so fast it may as well have been an Olympic record. Even the Orange juice tasted freshly squeezed and oh so cold. Even if you're not crazy hungover, this is THE place to get breakfast off the strip. The service was friendly and efficient too, with only a 20 minute wait on a Friday morning. The owner himself came out to say hello too and make everyone feel welcome and ask how the food was. Little touches like that just can't be beat.",

My REAL corned beef hash was like none other in Las Vegas, which you may think is odd, but it's a feat to get it right. Served with my choice of scrambled eggs, their version of home fries and a Thomas's English Muffin, not a generic English muffin. No bagels on the menu, but oh well. Las Vegas isn't a bread city and most commercially provided bread isn't great. I was very impressed with the attentive staff and constantly filled coffee cup. Even on a Thursday afternoon there was a line out the door, so they're doing something right.",

I admit, at first when I arrived there, the gentleman calling names was a little intimidating ha ha ha!!! He was yelling names and setting deadlines but he was great with everyone waiting and really sold the business by working with people to get them in, assuring us the wait was worth it. And he was right!!!  Inside, we sat at our table. We had to wait a little bit of time but it was understandable as they were full!!! But our waitress came to the table, apologized for the wait, and gave us a free freshly made Cinnamon Bun!!! (Amazing and delicious!!) We said the wait was not long at all but she insisted and we were floored with her kindness and great customer service. The owner came to our table and mentioned it was his daughter and she would take good care of us!   I really fell in love with this place for the service. The owner was kind, made a genuine compliment to us, and made us feel at home. Everyone had genuinely great customer service!! Nothing fake, actual people that care about the customer and want to give you the best service possible. I couldn't believe how amazing the service was!!  And to top it off, the food was delicious! I had Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and it was a perfect portion with a delicious homemade taste. And the pancakes are to die for!!! I'm craving them as I write this!! They were fluffy and just the perfect size. One you bite into that with butter and syrup, there is no going back!!! I was so impressed with this restaurant.  I can't say enough about this place, it was truly an amazing experience and will now be my go to breakfast spot every time I visit Las Vegas. The people and food are amazing, this is a must-go and could possible be my favorite breakfast restaurant!!!",

Our server Roneshia sat us, gave us the run down, and left to get our drinks. Kat, the manager, dropped by to tell us \"we serve big food. You can probably get away with ordering one meal for your kids and splitting it.\" Who does that? An honest business does that.   Roneshia was prompt, attentive, friendly and a wonderful server. As I told her as we were leaving, she provided the best service we'd ever had.   The food was great. It was indeed big, and even splitting one meal two ways between two kids, there was some extra left for dad.   The owner dropped by and asked where we were from. He was so incredibly friendly, and shared that he'd spent some time in our neck of the woods. He didn't do this to just our table. He asked every single table in there where they were from, and it felt genuine.   After we'd finished eating, he dropped by again to ask \"was everything good?\" and I told him no. He immediately asked, \"what could we have done better?\" With a big smile I said nothing, because it was OUTSTANDING. I appreciate that he was soliciting feedback from every table. This is an owner that is out front, involved in the day to day operations, and is serious about customer care.   We will absolutely be back on our next trip. I defy you to find better service- anywhere. You won't. Six stars. They've earned it.",

The prices were phenomenal, portions huge, delicious food, and great service. I'm so happy we stopped and had brunch. My husband had steak and eggs, while I had the country fried steak. We both had a pancake on the side. The pancakes are as big as a regular sized dinner plate, they are buttery fluffy and filling. Eating brunch here kept us full for the day. I ordered a big breakfast of 3 pancakes, 3 eggs, and bacon for my kids and was able to easily split it 3 ways and they had leftovers. My country fried steak hit the spot as I was missing living in the NC at the moment. We will be dinning here again if we stop in Vegas.",

I got the Mr. Mama Short Stack, came with 2 eggs, meat of choice (BACON!), and 2 pancakes; and not little pancakes, big pancakes for less than $8. Doug got the Steak and Eggs; small rib eye steak with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast for $10. We both liked our food and I feel like the prices are cheaper than many breakfast joints in town. We did buy the Yelp deal which is a kick ass offer. We had a couple of friends with us that got a Breakfast Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy (they add maple syrup to their gravy, interesting!), unfortunately weren't as pleased with their food as we were. Me and my husband would definitely go back and try it again.",

Tired of our usual joints, we decided to see what all the hype is about at Mr. Mamas. We were pleased to see plenty of parking and a spacious restaurant. Most of the tables were filled, but we were able to snag a seat without any wait. The menu is to the point with some very intriguing and traditional selections. The menu does appear to be Greek inspired which I thought was a fun twist on a breakfast joint.  The coffee was consistently refilled and the service was spot on. The owner was out and about mingling and chatting with the patrons.   I opted for the Jenna Wrap while my husband went with a more traditional chicken fried steak and hash browns. We also had a side of gyro meat. My wrap consisted of over hard egg, avocado, cilantro, jalapeno, salsa, sour cream, & cheddar cheese. It was a perfect, light blend of ingredients to get my morning started.  The chicken fried steak was perfectly prepared and the gravy wasn't too overwhelming. It was the perfect balance of unhealthy but delicious goodness. The gyro meat was also a hit.   Price point is pretty standard for s breakfast joint but with superior good and service.",

I ordered a veggie omelet with hash browns and a side of bacon. It was amazing!   My recommendation is to start with a cinnamon roll and coffee as soon as you sit down, so you can nosh while you peruse the menu. Otherwise you'll be too full to eat it at the end of the meal because they give you just that much food.",

I'm pretty sure I can update this review to 5 stars later because the managers care, read the reviews, respond, and hopefully will try to improve.   The service is great, 5 stars! You're quickly seated and brought drinks. Take orders real fast and come back around to check in and offer ice tea refills often. The owner/s seem like great people from the little we've spoke. They're always working, when owners are there often and care the business does good! The owners opened the door for me with smiles and hand shakes today. The server came around often, tended to few special requests, nice and interactive, and been their years. Even the cashier lady asked how I was mid meal 2 of the visits at least. It's very great to see they train all employees to work together.   Overall the food is pretty good but left much to be desired sadly to say. After reading the reviews you just expect more of a wow factor.  They're good about cooking eggs just how you ask and special requests are nicely addressed.   Food has good presentation and just right portions so you do not need to get to go containers often, nothing real huge and wasteful which I like.   Ice tea is perfect. 5 star  Biggest problem is the soup, never changes and is so boring and confusing. Chicken noodle is just okay, could be way better. The other soup is just a broth, no tiny chunks even! It's tasty and could be good if they added stuff to chew on, changed them daily, made fresh with lots of care. This would be an easy important fix. 2 star  I think most of the menu is overall bland and could be improved. I hope they will take these criticism and actually do that maybe so I'm being picky in thorough. The menu has only simple offerings with not enough flavor, take more shots and try to truly earn the hype.   Potatoes were okay but for the hype you'd expect fresh cut amazing with lots of extra flavor but they charge .50c more to get tiny amount of onions and peppers tossed over the average home fries. I've had so many amazing breakfast taters that I know they could improve this easy and hope they do. 2 star  Benedict was cooked good and muffin was soft and easy to cut but could be bit better. Sauce was little odd and came with too much, thankfully they have their own plate so it doesn't get on other things. It was pretty good, cooked well, olives were good, but with little touch up it could be better and earn the hype. 4.2 star  Breakfast burrito was small and didn't come with potatoes I believe, maybe they changed it but if not they need to. They give little too much potatoes in other meals but none on the side on the burrito because it has them in the burrito. It's already small, this is not good value and not worth the hype. 2.5 stars  So to recap I'd say service is 5 star, but food is a frustrating 3 at best.  Managers willingness to be there to work means they're likely to improve. They'll read and respond to this review which is great to see. Problem is they don't need too improve so worried they won't. I mean they haven't for years, same soup and menu, boring decor. Had the soup been changed today or potatoes I'd of have 5 star but no changes. Please take a shot mamas and truly try to earn the hype and a real 5 star! I'd love to update the review and will be back.",

After the reviews I'm curious about not only what this place produces but the tastebuds that grace this place with their presence.  All in all, won't return as there is a sea of b-fast places to eat fat for the $50+ we paid that are out of this world. Also overheard a conversation between the staff and a lady saying,\"oh I know, eat and get out, eat and get out.\" In response to a similar comment made by another staff member. Def not the quality or experience I would expect from a bad 4.5 star rating.",

I loved how as soon as we got to the restaurant, they made us smile. Before I even opened the door, a guy greeted us opening the door for us. Started us off on a great day.   I ordered the French Toast(2) and a Cinnamon Roll. Others ordered the Veggie Omelet, Country Fried Steak w/ Eggs, and Steak and eggs.  The Cinnamon Roll came out first and it was gone in a jiffy. It tasted homemade, fresh, and OMG amazing. Loved it. The French Toast was also really good, tasted like quality French toast. Next the omelets. Well first of all they were HUGE and they tasted savory and fresh, just how omelets should be.   Overall quality food and loved the quick service. Definitely recommend for people that love traditional American breakfast/brunch.",

I don't need to be doted on- I just need my food and coffee filled and they did that. Food was DELICIOUS and my daughter claims it was the best French toast she's ever had.

The bacon was the best food item though and was cooked really perfect the way I wanted it. I've never had bacon cooked that perfect in a restaurant before.

I tried the Cali omelet, very yummy, loved the pico and the avocado, at 4 eggs it's was way more than I could eat, so I brought the left overs back and it was enough for our breakfast the next day.  Prices; much better than the strip. Both had home fries they reminded me of perfectly done French fries, just bite size. Wait; was told 20 minutes, were seated in less than 10. Portions; very generous  My only reason for not giving 5 stars was that my hubby witnessed an interaction between someone in back (appeared to be owner) and a waitress, he wasn't very nice in the way he spoke to her and when she came out of the back area she was not smiling, this bothered us. We own a business and always treated all our employees with dignity & love, it bothers us to see someone treated rudely.    Not sure we'll return but it's a maybe right now.",

When I arrived everything was more expensive then the online price by $.5-1. When I went back to point this out I was told that the menus they have in store show the new prices. This is really not acceptable as it is the restaurants responsibility to keep there menu prices online up to date. I would have expected them to offer to refund the difference but instead I was given excuses about how they moved a year ago and sometimes it's hard to change the menu online.",

Everything exceeded my expectations.  The owner works the front like a seasoned vet. Energetic and ready to please. So many employees working like a well oiled machine everyone helping each other.      The food was amazing. IT really tasted fresh. It seems more and more restaurants are beginning to have that artificial taste with cheese and eggs but not Mr Mama's. I ordered a Spanish omelette. Eggs were fluffy, cheese and spinach tasted great, was covered with fresh avocado. The hash browns were crispy and full of flavor. To top it off the coffee was great. Not like that burnt crap you get at every diner.    Bottom line I just straight loved this place. This will be my stop every time I visit Vegas!",

It's far off the strip, you need to taxi or Uber. Cannot walk. It's straight down from Mandalay Bay, about 1 mile off strip.  We had an omelette and pancake stack.  The omelette is large (4 eggs) and was delicious, I highly recommend. The pancakes are home made and gigantic. No joke, the full stack of 3 pancakes was over 2 inch's thick and larger then the plate. My son is 17 and always finishes his meal, he could not finish.  Must order.  Only downside on pancakes is the come plane - no option for banana or chocolate chips on menu.  This is a MUST visit while in Vegas.  Very reasonable prices compared to the breakfast places on the strip. Your food bill savings offset the taxi fare.   Again - not to be missed.",

Had a party of 10 and this place was fantastic. The service was spot on. Everyone helped out. Not just my table but everyone's. From a party of 2 to a party of 10 everyone seemed to get the same warm welcome and great service. The owner Nick (by form of a loud announcement which was awesome) congratulated my son on his graduation and \"bestowed upon him\" a cinnamon roll  (which was delicious).   Now to the good stuff--THE FOOD. Every single thing that we got was delicious. Now with 10 people we got to try a lot of dishes. The gravy-out of this world. It has bacon and sausage-nuff said. My mom had a lunch plate with onion rings on it (I stole one when she wasn't looking ) best one I've had in a long time. I had the chicken fried steak and it was probably the best one I have ever had here in Vegas. Everyone else loved the food as well.   Thanks Mr Mama from this Mama for making my sons meal a great one!",

I'm a breakfast person and looked up Yelp for a highly rated breakfast place. Man did I hit the jackpot with Mr. Mamas! See what I did there... this is Vegas after all! Okay enough of my cheesiness... I take ratings seriously and even though I had to spend $50 in cabs, I wanted to check it out.   First impression, I the taxi pulls up and Nik, the owner, opens the door and says,     \"Welcome! We've been waiting for you!\" This guy is like a cousin that you actually want to see at family reunions. He was so sweet to my mom which I loved. Then our waitress was bilingual so that was an added bonus, bc my mom could speak to her more comfortably. But so far I haven't even mentioned how amaze balls the food was! I've include pictures of our incredibly flavorful omelettes. So generous with the avocado! But I gobbled up the french toast before I could take a picture. Did I mention I have a bit of an appetite?   Anyway, the food was delectable and the service was completely delightful. Yelpers you didn't fail me. This place deserves the 5 stars!",

    "text": "Happy Food, Happy Dude!    That should be everybody's motto. I'm one happy dude when I'm served good food with great service. It's no secret.  Mr. Mamas is a very popular spot in Las Vegas for breakfast.  There's usually a wait because the whole town loves this place.  Mr. Mamas is not just a local favorite, tourist and travelers come here too.  You'll even count the amount of cars with California, Arizona, and Utah license plates in the parking lot. The Manager stated that over 65% of their customers during the weekend come from California.  That's amazing considering that Mr. Mamas is not even on the strip.    I first experienced Mr. Mamas a couple of years ago and what sticks out the most is their excellent customer service.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I'm not the only person that mentions the A++ service here.  There hasn't been one time, not one, when I ever touched the door.  Someone from Mr. Mamas, usually the Manager Shawn, opens the door as I walk in and walk out.  Shawn leads by example and his enthusiasm towards his customers is also duplicated by the employees here.  It's guaranteed at Mr. Mamas that you will be welcomed on the way in, checked on during your meal, and greeted on the way out. And if you're getting coffee, don't worry about staying caffeinated.  They are like ninjas here and will top off your cup without you even noticing.  Ordering is simple and fast.  Getting your food is even faster.  But don't let their speediness discourage you from staying and chilling out.  Mr. Mamas encourages you to enjoy your meal at your pace and will never rush you.  I really can't say enough about the customer service at Mr. Mamas.  Their commitment to their guest is as good as it gets.   As for the food, I don't get too creative when I have breakfast. I'll usually stick to their eggs, bacon, toast, more eggs, and maybe a breakfast steak.  Every once in a while, I'll get their oatmeal or a short stack when my body craves it.  By the way, their hash browns extra crispy is dangerously good.  Bottom line, the food has always been awesome.  When the service is great, the food tends to taste even better.  Overall, I know what I'm going to get when it comes to Mr. Mamas and that's a good All-American breakfast with a side of excellent customer service. Thank You!  2017 Yelp Review #60",

There was a short 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning but it went by quickly.  We were seated and the friendliest waitress Jazmin came right away to help us got our drinks quickly and then to the breakfast. We ordered chicken fried steak and corned beef hash.  Omg the gravy has sausage and bacon and the steak was a crispy piece of deliciousness.  Not to dry and the gravy was bursting with flavor.  Then best of all on my home fries they let you decide if you want peppers and onions or not my dreams came True I hate picking all that stuff out.  Corned beef hash was scrumptious not too salty and not a ton of potatoes with scrambled eggs it hit the spot.  Must try when in Vegas!!!!",

Most of the patrons looks like they were locals which is a good sign. The lady taking names was very personable. She asked everyone leaving how their meal was. Very nice!  The service was quick. The food was simply amazing. I mean you really can't go bad with eggs and bacon but they make it very fresh and tasty. This place is even better than the Omelette House.

Our server appeared immediately, filled our coffee cups (which by the way, was never empty), and proceeded to take our order.  I ordered the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and rye toast, my husband ordered an omelette.  Our food arrived a very short time later, and we couldn't have been happier.  Everything was DELICIOUS!!!

I asked him how many people are in front of us and he started getting irritated and angry.  The people I was with said the wait is too long. Some got there before me and waited even longer.  The host came back and instead of saying something nice became super rude and then he said they are not going to seat us and that they refuse us service.   This is the worst restaurant experience I have had in Vegas and I've lived here for 10 years now.  Not to mention the place looks horrible inside. It smelled bad and the tables and chairs are the old and cheap ones.   I can't comment on the food as we didn't try it. But the service is not something you would wanna experience, or at least the service we got from the host. That guy should be fired.  Stay away.",

My husband had a Greek omelette which he said was one of the best he's ever had!  Will definitely be back on my next vegas trip!  Thanks Mr. Mama!!!!",

I finally got the perfect opportunity to do so, and I am ever so glad I did! I was greeted by the pleasant hostess, and she suggested I try the Jenna wrap. I ordered it to go with a side of crispy hash browns and they got it ready in record time. It was DELICIOUS!!! Being that it was a generous size, I could only eat half of it and saved the rest for later. (It was still delicious, later!) This place is a little gem! The service and friendliness of the staff...they greet all their regular customers by name!...the cleanliness of the restaurant and the FOOD....absolutely fantastic!!!!!",

The pressure (read others have stated similar) to give a good review on yelp from the owner and staff makes u feel like you are there for the benefit of marketing thier company not enjoying a meal with your friends.   My daughter tried the French toast and ate just a few bites ..  overloaded sugar high of chocolate and powder sugar not flavor.  I am certian with the reading of the other reviews and the indirect nudge they must be getting these ratings unethically or with reward because it's not due to 5 star food or service.  I'm perplexed.  Just a average joint with below average atmosphere and nothing to write home about service.   The smell of funny business going on here.   Losing faith in the validity of yelp.   Would I go back, no.... nothing special for the drive.",

In fact I believe that I can say that if there was a doctorate program for southern cooking I would easily be a professor of B&G. That being said Mr. Mamas is proof that Nevada will compete with the pretentious Dixieland enclaves and has a chance to be competitive.   Imagine ripples of perfectly gray silky gravy with bits of smokey-bacon, sage-smoked sausage and maple syrup. Then add pepper to give it that perfect balance.  Combine that with the crunchy textured outside shell of a biscuit cut in twain with each fluffy pillow drenched in the gravy sipping up the good stuff with gusto.  Next time I need a hand soaking up some unmentionable bender I had on the strip I'm going to Mamas for some TLC.",

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash topped with scrambled eggs and a side of home style fries and an additional side of bacon.  The eggs were pretty standard but the Corned Beef hash was out of this world good as were the super crispy yet not greasy \"fries\" or cubed potatoes.  The only thing that could have made breakfast any better would have been a Bloody Mary.",

The owner even provided a french toast sample while we waited.  My Ma would have loved to order it if only it was officially on the menu.",

I pull up my trusty Yelp app and this one came up.  They got really good review so figure we check it out.   When we got there, there was a little wait 20-30mins. Not to mention it was really way out from the strip but was on the way leaving Las Vegas so it workout for us. 25mins later we were able to get a table for 5. The restaurant looks like a older style diner but with some newer vibe. I like it. Very family originated feel which I like.  Food wise, good portion, fresh, has variety of options from breakfast to lunch and dinner. The wait staff was attentive. I'm liking this place. For coming here the first time, not bad, will come out and try it again next time we are in Las Vegas!",

I'm new to Vegas and this was the first restaurant to pop up in my google search.    As the hostess takes my name, she tells me that the wait is supposed to be 30 minutes but she can see if we can get me seated quicker since I'm by myself.  Sure enough the manager (I assume) let's me know that the seating will probably be 15-20 minutes.  I'm like perfect!  No rush.  I honestly didn't mind having to wait 30 minutes.  I probably only waited about 7-10 minutes.  As they walked me to my seat, two employees greeted me and thanked me for coming in.  When I sat down, I saw the manager compliment a family as they left the restaurant.  I'm so glad I came here today.",

Nothing but big portions, solid/friendly service, quality ingredients and taste, budget friendly prices, and overall great dining experience. Expect long lines and a wait but that comes with the territory of being a local favorite combined with tourist attraction.  I really appreciated the all around terrific service we received. Multiple servers attended to our large group of 8 people. When we tried taking a group photo, a gentlemen (maybe the manager?) stepped up and offered to take it for us. He stood on a chair to get an aerial view so it would capture not only our large group, but all the food on the table. Kudos for going the extra mile.  Food portions are GENEROUS. Omelettes contain 4 eggs!! :O Your doctor may not like your cholesterol levels afterwards but your wallet and tummy sure will. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu items. Mr Mamas takes great care in preparing dishes that don't skimp on ingredients.   Overall this is a very solid breakfast spot that won't let you down. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the menu offerings are largely your standard to-be-expected type of dishes. There isn't anything \"unique\" or \"special\" per se. You go to Mr Mamas for traditional fare in a friendly and welcoming environment. You don't go for a gourmet experience. And that's just fine with me. :)",

Upon first walking in you will notice a friendly atmosphere that is very diner like and you will be greeted by extremely nice employees, they even open the door for you. This place is hopping all the time so be prepared for a little wait but the food is well worth it  So I ordered the chicken fried steak with hash browns, eggs, and a biscuit and it was the only meal I ate today lol. It was truly enough food for 2 people and it only cost $13 which was well worth it. The chicken fried steak come with a homemade gravy that has sausage and bacon in it and let me tell you it's amazing, the texture and taste are spot on. So after ordering we received our food within like 5 minutes which was insane and almost made me wonder if it was fresh but after tasting I knew it was just made so kudos to the kitchen for the prompt service . This place checks all categories for a breakfast joint- fantastic food, huge portions, great value, fast service, lots of options , and it's clean with a friendly staff.  I must say the only thing I would change is that I can tell they are trying to turn customers so after we ate we were kinda rushed along in a nice way so they can get the next person in. I completely understand where they are coming from , however , sometimes after I channel my inner fat boy I like to sit for a few minutes until after my I-'tis manifests lol",

And I'm totally glad I did that because all of us loved it. A buddy and I split our orders of country fried steak and eggs and The Stack and I'm salivating as I'm typing this. I guess I'm just addicted to fried food since I can't get enough of that crunchy scrumptious country fried meat soaked in egg yolk (insert drooling face here). The buttery stack of golden pancakes also had me doing the tippy toe dance on the inside with each bite that I took. Everything was simply amazing. Others of us in the group ordered breakfast burrito, omelettes, and a bunch of other orders that I can't recall. I didn't get to try their dishes but everyone were satisfied with their dishes.   Those who have found this place disappointing must've either A) went there on an off-day for the chef, or B) discovered a much better gem that I've yet to venture to (share some info!). As for me and the squad, we left happily rounder than when we entered. I'm glad to mark down another off-the-strip Vegas foodies gem!",

    "text": "Went to Mr Mama's for a team members birthday. Our team of 11 in attendance.There is no opportunity to call in advance so we arrived and checked in. The team advises that arrive time was 11:48 am - apparently the log time was 11:53 am - basically 5 minute difference. Advised that the wait would be about 30 minutes. Numerous customers arrived after our team, and were seated. The person who greets customers (later identifying himself as the owner) asked if we all had to sit together and we said yes.  He then said that they were waiting for three tables to open up and that the customers seated at the tables had finished eating and they were waiting for them to get up.  He then motioned to the area. I looked at that section and all but 1 table had customers seated and eating.  We were still being patient. Finally, I called the owner over at 12:22 pm to inquire about progress and he became confrontational saying that we \"were patient with him he would be accommodating, if not, he would not be accommodating\".  He proceeded to berate me in front of customers and my team.  I advised my team that they could stay, but I was leaving.  The owner approached a team member and asked how many in the party.  My team member commented that he was rude to her boss.  The owner then turned and directed his staff to \"break the tables apart\" (which were still only two).  The remaining team had no choice but to leave.  Not good customer service by any stretch of the imagination.   Will never go back - any of the 11 of us.",

When we ordered not only was everything correct and tastey. It came out quickly, fresh, and warm. It was nice hearing the manager be involved with his staff, helping corrdinate the flowing customers coming into the restaurant. His staff was wonderful, never an empty cup of coffee or a dirty plate left. Honestly no complaints. Our bill between 6 people was so reasonable. Very well priced for great quality of food.",

    "text": "I'm very pleased that I finally got a chance to dine here. The many great reviews weren't misleading and Mr Mama's didn't disappoint. We are usually not in the Enterprise area, but had an early morning appointment at the Subaru dealership.   I'm not surprised that there wasn't much of a wait at 830 AM on a Monday morning. We were seated immediately and our drink order was promptly taken and delivered. Our server was polite and to the point-- I always appreciate that. Especially early in the morning. Quickly browsing through the fairly extensive menu, we went with the Chicken Fried Steak and Homemade Corned Beef & Hash. I swear, in the blink of an eye, large plates of food magically appeared before our eyes. Sides of sourdough toast and a fresh biscuit were delivered shortly after.   Heavier breakfast aren't a regular thing for me, but I had no issues overfilling myself with my corned beef hash, home fries and over easy eggs. The corned beef was great and clearly not Hormel from a can. An extremely nice change. The meat to potato to egg ratio was spot on for me. I polished the plate and still managed to eat my biscuit, which was generously dolloped with some really tasty sausage gravy off of my forever +1's chicken fried steak. Next time, I'll ask if they can give me a small side of it so I don't need to share. My guy can eat and he just didn't have it in him to finish his last few bites. Very surprising, but he gave me the rest to finish off because it was so good and didn't want to let it go to waste. I didn't complain. His chicken fried steak wasn't too heavily breaded and overly greasy. His sunny side up eggs were perfect. Hot sauce was already waiting at the table.  Our early morning feast came out to around $35 with tax and not including tip. You definitely get what you pay for here and I can pretty much guarantee you won't leave hungry. I would happily stop in again next time I'm in the area.",

Once inside it's noisy and staff is everywhere. Very friendly and welcoming quick service despite a couple of large groups.   The food itself was good and tasted fresh.  We had the Denver omelette. It was tasty with hash browns and wheat toast. The half order of biscuits and gravy come with 1 egg or potatoes. We chose the egg. Plenty of good to fill you up perfectly.   The menu has lots of options including build your own.   We will definitely stop by here again.",

There were a lot of ppl waiting but the management at this place handles their business and cleared tables line no other. A group would leave, table would be cleaned, and the next group would get seated ASAP. We waited for no more than 30 minutes.   The service was absolutely fantastic. The waiters were very patient. The lady at the door assigning groups to tables was so friendly and made sure we were good and happy.   The FOOD!!! Honestly some of the best brunch I have ever had. I got the chicken fried steak. This came with gravy, choice of eggs any style, toast, and potatoes any style. I was able to substitute the toast for a pancake. The gravy was unbelievable!! It was so good, I asked for another bowl on the side. The eggs I got fried hard. Good! Can't go wrong with eggs. I got hash brown potatoes. They were also really good. Can't go wrong with those either. The waiter asked if I wanted them crispy and that's how I had it. The pancake was very good. They make it from scratch! The chicken fried steak was amazing. Well seasoned and packed with flavor. Eating it with the gravy, unmatched. The perfect brunch meal!!!!  What makes this place even better are the prices! The prices are so good for the portions you get. The strip rips you off but this place, every dollar spent is worth it and you are also supporting a mom&pop restaurant.",

I tend to go just after opening so I can say much for how busy it gets at peak times. I always order the mama burger. It's huge and so juicy I need no convincing that it's made from fresh meat. Even after I pull the onion rings out of the burger, I take a second to plan on how I'll bite into it because it's just so big. On top of that, the produce always tastes crazy fresh. If you must have breakfast food,  you can't go wrong with the eggs benedict. The eggs are never overcooked, the English muffin is perfectly toasted and doesn't get too soggy. I've been told to be weary of Hollandaise sauce at diners as it's often premade and sits in a fridge until needed but it's so good at Mamas that I'm never suspicious of what I'm eating.",

The waiter informed us that  The gravy had sausage, bacon, and maple syrup. He offered a sample prior to placing order, but who needs to sample something that has bacon and syrup in it? So I ordered the biscuits and gravy to trt the gravy! But it was not as I expected. The biscuit was more like a cornbread muffin. The gravy was just ok, it was just a lot going on.   Ordered a cinnamon roll as well and it was delish, simple and yummy. Icing isn't too sweet, just right and gooey. It was cooked to perfection. The cinnamon roll had ground  cinnamon on it. I said I was only gonna have a bite but took 3 to get all the flavors analyzed!!! HaHa!  We ordered the chicken steak, and it was ok. The gravy doesn't really enhance the flavor, in my opinion. The eggs were scrambled to perfection. The waiter asked if I wanted the hash browns crispy which is awesome, I didn't have to ask. Overall I rate the meal at solid B. The short stack of pancakes were decent. Definitely worth getting again, Solid A.",

The chicken fried steak gravy made it. We devoured our food. It is a small, local spot that should definitely be given a try.   What made it even better was our waiter Tyler. He explained everything so well and asked us things we weren't used to being asked, like if we wanted our bacon cooked as is or crispy, or if we wanted lemon with our water. It was nice and he was so attentive. We even told the cashier that, as well as the gentleman up front. He was so personable and such a great waiter. Our drinks were never empty.",

    "text": "Found this place through yelp & w/so many positive reviews, I decided to stop in for a late breakfast before we hit the road. We came in around noon on a Thursday. We we're immediately greeted when we walked in. Place was packed & several people waiting. We waited about 15 mins, not bad for a group of 5.   Nick (owner) came by our table to introduce himself & answer any questions we might have. Gave us a little back story of his family in the restaurant business & was just a pleasure to speak with him. Great customer service from the entire staff. Never had to wait for a refill either. We will definitely come back on our next visit to Vegas & try their lunch.   5 stars for these reasons: - GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE #1 - Dining area & tables were very clean - Good Food  - Good Portions  - Good Prices - Cinnamon rolls",

We usually wait 30-45 minutes before being seated, but all the better to build up a Healthy appetite for their generous portions. I highly recommend trying out their pancakes and biscuits & gravy...all the while noting that I've never been disappointed by their food. Be sure to ask about their daily specials! Everything comes to the table right when it's ready and it doesn't take too long. Servers are also very friendly and helpful. The crowds outside do not lie, their food is delicious. You will not regret trying Mr. Mamas.",

I came with a large group early in the morning (it opens at 6am) to have a sort of business meets pleasure aka eat good food, talk work.  The service is really 5 star! Really the best. The owner came out and talked with us. Super nice guy, he gave us a history of the restaurant, explained he wanted us to have a great time and to let him know if we needed anything. The food was prompt, coffees constantly filled.   The food:  1. Short stack of the best pancakes, large light and fluffy! So good! With eggs over easy, and fruit. Mine was great 5/5 2. Eggs Benedict very heavy on the sauce, hash browns nothing to wow 4/5 3. Breakfast wraps: their torilla game is lacking. Not very good, wouldn't recommend  4. I think the chicken fried steak (I didn't try it) but my friend said it was \"exceptional.\"   Will I come back? Ya sure great price, great food. But only if I'm already going to spring valley area since its like a 25 min drive from my house. It would be my go-to if I was closer",

They would offer peppers with your potatoes and then they started up charging if you wanted it. Understandable. The steaks tho! Omg. The first few times we went they were nice and juicy and tasted fresh. Now.....they're tough and very poor quality. I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, it has a weird taste and texture to it. Last few times our steaks were overcooked, poor quality and horrible. Eggs were also undercooked and toast wasn't even toasted.  It's unfortunate because we loved this place.

We were greeted by Shawn, who kept us laughing while we waited for our table.  We got seated within the time quoted, and even though the place was busy, we were taken care of almost immediately.  Our server, Jenna was exceptionally knowledgable about the menu items and her suggestions were on point!  That cheese steak sandwich was delish!!! Other staff stopped by the table, even Ed the chef, to check on us, and  every person who talked to us had a smile on their face, especially Kat!    Fellow yelpers.....take my word for it.....this is a fantastic, family restaurant where the customer is definitely appreciated!",

I had the eggs Benedict with hash browns and my daughter had the build your own omelette and my wife order the half order biscuits and gravy. Plenty of food for all of us. Everything was home made and hot. The wait staff was over the top friendly. Although one young lady was responsible for taking care of us at least 4 different people attended to our every need. They worked together to take care of all the guests. Great job!  Worth the stop.",

The besy YUMMY warm cinnamon roll was the BOMB of all !  The wait time for Saturday morning for 3 adults and 3 children  took about 1/2 hour.",

The hashbrowns were nice and crispy on the outside and cooked properly in the middle. Service was even 5 star + as they greeted you upon arrival and our server was the same server both mornings, PROPS to her too!",

    "text": "The best breakfast joint in Las Vegas! To Black Bear, Egg Works, Omelet House, Hash House, Cracked Egg, and whoever else is out there: Bow down to your new king. Mr. Mamas runs this town now! Consistently TOP NOTCH breakfast and lunch. My personal favorite is the Greek Omelet; a beautifully cooked omelet stuffed with onions, spinach, garlic and Feta cheese. Everything goes together so perfectly, it's to die for. Literally, if I ever served some sort of sentence in Death Row for whatever reason and had to choose a last meal, the Greek Omelet is a very strong contender for the spot. They are just as good with everything else too. Pancakes are beautifully fluffy and tasty as hell. Burgers are thick and juicy. Bacons wonderfully crispy. So on and so forth.   On top of all the wonderful food is even more wonderful people that work there. The owner (I think his name is Nick, yeah let's go with Nick), is quite possibly the friendliest person that's ever existed. No matter how busy the place is (It's ALWAYS busy by the way, so please be prepared for around a ten to fifteen minute wait. Don't be some passive-aggressive sourpuss like some people I saw the other day), he has an incredibly warm and friendly personality. He always makes it a point to greet every single person that comes in. He will always come by and check if everything is up to par (and it ALWAYS is, actually, screw \"up to par\" it's always a goddamn double birdie). He'll strike up candid conversation with anybody willing to have a conversation (He'll be sure to keep his distance if you look like you don't want to be bothered just as well, worry not introverted people!). His servers are just as great too, incredibly friendly and just RIGHT ON TOP OF IT when it comes to serving you. I only had to wait a couple minutes in a FREAKING PACKED HOUSE until my food arrived. I also don't think I held an empty glass for more than a minute. As soon as I finished my water or coffee, they'd have it refilled in an instant, while they're tending to a billion other people in the restaurant and just staying incredibly friendly on top of it. Nick, you better be paying these guys and girls great salaries, because they sure as hell deserve it!  The closest thing to a \"criticism\" I could give this place would be it's lack of the more specialized things. For instance, in terms of hot sauce, they only carry Cholula and Regular Tabasco I think. No Habanero of Jalapeno Tabasco if you're into that sort of thing. No obscure hot sauce that you could only buy in some small city if you're into that sort of thing. The same goes with coffee. No fancy-ass French Presses, Cappuccinos, Macchiatos, etc here. Just........coffee. I don't even think they have Hazelnut creamer. Their food while being super tasty, is also not all that exotic neither. Just your standard stuff that you could find at most similar establishments. Everything here is very \"basic\" in a way.........which is completely freaking fine with me! The QUALITY OF THEIR FOOD IS GODDAMN SPECTACULAR ON A REGULAR BASIS. Come on, my favorite basketball player of all time is Tim Duncan. He doesn't throw down jamtastic dunks or rainbow threes, he just grinds people down with pure fundamentals. I FREAKING LOVE PURE FUNDAMENTALS!!! Mr. Mama's is the Tim Duncan of the Breakfast Restaurant industry, which is obviously the best compliment in the world. It doesn't have any fancy-shmancy crap that make little difference (if any) in enjoying your restaurant experience. It just has WORLD CLASS food and customer service. If having all that means I miss out on \"Ass-Kickin Hot Sauce\" so be it.",

The chicken fried steak breakfast is hearty and not overly salted like most places. It is tipped with a delicious country gravy made with maple syrup, sausage and bacon. Delicious! The omelets are fluffy and loaded with fresh and tasty fillings. I love the hashbrowns. They are perfect, crispy without being dry. The pancakes are huge, fluffy and filling. My toddler is content with just one and the price is just right. The menu isn't fancy just full of good comfort food that doesn't weigh you down for the rest of the day.",

The wait staff is on full court press, if you need something they have it at your table before you realize you need it.  Any recommendations would be- add a kids menu. The huge portions are two or three kids worth. Only problem, if they did that it would be free, because their prices are already dirt cheap.  Great place, glad yelp sent us here.",

My son was wondering why the place is so empty and thought that I might have chose the wrong place but within 15 minutes the place was filled. We ordered:  1. Mama's Short stack -  two pancakes,  2 eggs with choice of meat; pancakes are delicious.   Even though we were full but we couldn't help ourselves and so most finished all.  2. Western omelette - super duper good.   Highly recommended.  3. Mama's French toast - it was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> For kids,  you should just order egg and toast with additional side order if needed.  Service here is excellent.   Everyone was friendly especially the owner.   He greeted you at the table and even opened the door for you.   My family love  this restaurant and will definitely come back whenever we are back to Vegas.",

Small 20 minute wait but sure worth it. I don't normally eat chicken fried steak but I had to try it because of so many others saying it was amazing. Well it lived up to the hype and surpassed my expectations. The first thing that came out was the cinnamon roll, it was tasty and hot, it seemed as though it was made fresh right that minute. I also tried the veggie omelette, and it was perfect also, with nice crispy hash-browns.",

I took my boyfriend for breakfast the other day to see if he had the same experience and he was amazed and highly recommends this. I forget the manager's name. Female. Very nice lady. She greeted us as we walked up, with a big bright smile and came over half way through our meal to make sure everything was to our standards. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The food is amazing. My boyfriend loved the bacon, which staff highly recommended on my first visit. My boyfriend won't eat anyone's eggs but mine. He tore those eggs up.... ALL OF THEM!! And finally, I must compliment them on the atmosphere... They didn't do too much or too little. The temperature was comfortable and the sweet aroma of coffee filled the air... But not too much. The place was cozy, just spacious enough, and very family friendly. The only thing they could do better is nothing. Keep up the good work guys. I'll be back!",

We were greeted immediately before the door shut and seated in their spacious, clean, well lit dining hall. Our order was made quickly and looked and tasted fresh and delicious. Our coffee was filled before we even thought about asking, and the waitress, Claudia, was attentive and sweet. As we left, there were two waitresses, including ours, who said good bye and the gentleman at the door, most likely the GM, gave us a nice good bye and a wonderful smile. It was almost like they opened their doors just for us. It was noticeably more crowded as we left at 9:00, than when we came at 8:30. So go early! We have found our Saturday morning breakfast place!

I told her that a restaurant with over 1000 great reviews had to be a good place. We looked at the menu and watched the packed restaurant serve some of the dishes which the portions looked HUGE so we decided to split something but had to at least try the cinnamon roll. It was by far the best homemade cinnamon role we've ever tried. The pancakes were delicious, the service was super. The owner Nick came over to greet us and we told him that we were trying his restaurant based on YELP reviews. He told us a bit about his family & beginnings. Very nice & interesting story. We had a bit of the cinnamon roll and pancake we brought home and my brother came over to the house about 6:00pm and we told him of the restaurant and the great food and he went to the refrigerator and heated up the leftovers. He said he couldn't wait to go there with his family. Give yourself a real treat and try this place.",

It's a home town diner vibe. I had eggs, bacon, home fries with peppers and onions and an English muffin.   The husband had an omelet, hash browns, toast. All was fantastic. I like my egg yolks pretty firm. It was perfect. I looked at many plates. Pancakes are thick, fluffy, and the size of  the plate. The French toast looks delicious. Their top seller is biscuits and gray. Its a little different so I was allowed to taste the gravy first. Much appreciated! It was good but not my taste. If you miss food from home this is your place. You will not leave hungry. It is not uscale, weird experimental food,  or extensive menus. It is top notch, normal breakfast, prepared right, and delivered by friendly and attentive staff. Well done Mr. Mama! I also went to the Crab Corner and will leave a review there.",

When I arrived and walked in I was most aggressively greeted and asked all kinds of questions. It was quite the barrage: a table for one? Are you getting take out? Are you waiting for someone? I was just making sure so we can help you... All that before: hello how are you? (Which never happened)   I was waiting for a friend before seating, so I just walked outside to wait. It would have been better to be asked: dine in or take out? How many in your party and would you like to wait?   My friend arrived. We were sat right away by someone else. We were able to get drinks right away. We got the special of strawberry pancakes, drink and eggs for $9 plus we got a side of hash browns. All good at this point.   Then things started going... Not well. We had a hair in the coffee cup, my eggs came in wrong (ordered over medium got scrambled) and when the runner/ server came back to give me the new eggs she handed me the plate instead of helping me to find a place on our crowded table to set it down.   The strawberry pancakes had thinly sliced strawberries, about 4-5 slices on each large pancake. Not even a full strawberry on each plate. Maybe one strawberry for both our orders put together. And there were 4 pancakes. We asked for more and they brought them. No big deal. Seems like it should have come with more than 1/2 strawberry each order.  The food was not amazing, but not terrible. The staff were nice about the mistakes and that made up for some, but the hair was a real bummer. That just turns my stomach. I give this place a C/C+.",

Adults each ordered something different & we all found our meals scrumptious with huge portions.

Before we even got to the door the staff had us smiling! We were greeted outside the restaurant and immediately seated. Our server, Claudia, was very nice and the food was great. We were pretty hangry when we pulled into the parking lot but our meal was out in less than 10 minutes and the restaurant was nearly full! Great food, great service, great price, great experience!",

The place is a lot bigger. I remember when this place was the 50 ' s Diner. There is definitely more room for parking which is a plus! The same great service from the servers.  We ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and steak n eggs. The chocolate chip pancakes are still fluffy and yummy.   We ordered our steak medium rare, which to me is red and pink in the middle and grill on the outside. I got my steak and it was completely red inside! I like medium rare but not rare. It almost looked blue in my opinion. But the server was kind enough to take it back to get cooked a little more. I was a bit shocked that I could hear the cooks talking in the back about my steak and pretty much saying it was medium rare and instead they cooked it to medium. Oh wells! I don't like making a big fuzz. The steak was still flavorful when it came out the second time and this time it was medium, which was okay.   The owner is so kind as always! He makes up for the cook's comments. Definitely will come here more often since it's so close to my house.",

    "text": "We first discovered Mr. Mamas in November of 2013.  We have been going back ever since.  We visited again today and we're just as thrilled with them. This was our first time at their new location. We  Below I s my original review. Prices have gone up slightly. The Chicken Fried steak was $1.25 more then in 2013. My omelet was the same.  Service was great. My coffee always full.  My former review below.Again from November 2013.   I LOVE BREAKFAST!  Because of that I am not easily impressed, and I don't just hand out five stars. It has to be earned.  With our Las Vegas trip planned  for the PBR Finals, I had already Yelped and decided what places we were going to try on out trip.  Mr. Mamas was at the top of my list.  We got to Mr. Mamas and were immediately seated.   The staff was so friendly. Our server was on the spot, my coffee cup never got below half way.  I had a Cheese Omelette (Pepperjack) and added tomatoes. Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. and he also ordered some French Toast.  Everything was DEEEEEELICIOUS! The portions were generous.  Last but not least talk about REASONABLE PRICE!!! Our breakfast was only $20.00  We had a lovely chat with the owner about his and his families history in the food business.   I loved the old photo they have of one of their restaurants in Detroit from long ago, complete with the mob guy in it coming for his weekly protection money.  The next time I am going to Las Vegas I am going to be more excited about my trip to Mr. Mamas then my trip to the rest of the town.  Great Breakfast and a wonderful owner and staff.   I so look forward to eating there again.  Bottom Line-This is a MUST go place if you are in Vegas and want to have the best breakfast in town.",

    "text": "Talk about another solid breakfast/lunch spot in Vegas. Most of all another great option on the west side of town. Apparently Mr Mamas moved from there old location but thankfully just up the road so still on my side of town! I have came twice and both times the experience was awesome. My first time came with another yelper Suzy H for no shocker another recovery meal from tri training. Talk about packed for lunch. Really both my visits lunch cross your fingers get seat. If you do get seat count on great experience from customer service, great food, and an owner that not often see HANDS on guy. He literally constantly walking around too every table making sure everything on point. Not just checking on customers. I felt like knowing that not chain believe just family run restaurant. The owner comes off very very genuine, totally asking for feedback, friendly, and sense that treats every customer like your part of his family. One of the first things notice about the dining room feels more like this big open family dining room. Not many booths just all old school tables and chairs. They do have some television around the room. Really not much going on with interior design.   My first trip order the breakfast burrito. I enjoy the size of it. It not small and it packed with all the good things in life. Eggs, Sausage, Onions, Cheese, and few more things. The salsa that comes with it. If I could would get bowl of that with chips and be in chips/salsa bliss. The second trip ordered the chili cheese omelette. Again size is not problem when you come to Mr Mama. All the food they serve is generous portion size. The chili something that Mr Mamas is famous for or least on the menu that the impression I got. It was good. Truth had better. The combination of the chili, cheese, and stuff in the omelette worked awesome for me! The fried potatoes believe they called it. Ah nothing special. The omelette worked more for me then the potatoes..  They do offer free drink with your yelp checkin.   Overall definitely fan of Mr Mamas. See myself coming back more often try more of the menu...",

We were starving after being in the car for hours, sleep-deprived and cranky. But as soon as we walked in, the manager (?) and server greeted us very warmly and got us set up with menus and drinks very quickly. I decided to get the steak and eggs, which also came with hash browns. Honestly, THE BEST hash browns I've ever had in my life!!! Not even exaggerating. I've been dreaming about the hash browns ever since I had them... they were so perfectly crunchy and potato-ey. Enough about the hash browns haha, the steak was good but just a bit overcooked (I had asked for medium well but got well done) and the eggs were wayyyy better than your typical IHOP eggs. My friend got the veggie omelet, which he loved and my boyfriend got the chicken finger sandwich (chicken tenders between bread) and that came with a side of your choice. I would definitely come back here for breakfast the next time I'm in Vegas!!",

There's nothing gourmet or special about Mr. Mamas, but the exceptional service, cheap prices and delicious breakfast makes this place worth a visit.  [Service: 5]  Mr. Mamas was my first stop in Vegas and boy, was it a great way to start my trip. I was greeted with a super friendly staff. Everyone was attentive and wanted to make sure we were having a pleasant dining experience. Our server, at the end, went out of her way to offer my bf and I water cups to-go, which was thoughtful and nice. The manager (or owner) was humble and SUPER friendly. He made us feel welcomed. I also noticed other workers consistently wiping down the tables and condiments at each table.   [Food: 4]  Come here for some good ole buttermilk pancakes, biscuits and gravy and egg benedicts. Everything we had was simple, homey and delicious!  [Value: 5]  Highly recommend. Great bang for your buck.

I ate at a high end steakhouse at the Bellagio last night and their service was only half as good as yours! There were two servers for our 6 people. They were super friendly, attentive and went above and beyond. Even if your food was only mediocre (which it wasn't) we'd still come back just based on the excellent service! The 2 additional staff members that came over to check on us (I'm assuming upper management), nice job on a simple, fast fly by just to check on your customers. I don't know of many restaurants that do this but when I find one, I appreciate it.   Finally the food...I ordered a cinnamon roll to split with my family before our meal. We just wanted a taste so a bite each for the 6 of us. It was soft, fresh, with just the right ratio of cinnamon to frosting. I had an (I think it was Cali) omelet. I substituted the sausage with mushrooms. It was cooked perfect and I appreciate the 4 egg omelet as opposed to the normal 3 egg. The hashbrowns were cooked perfect. Cooked crispy on the outside and soft but not mushy on the inside. I cleaned my plate it was all so good!  If I'm being honest, the food was really good but there were a few things I tasted from my families dishes that I didn't care for. I didn't like the gravy, it wasn't horrible but I'm not a big fan of the bacon in it. The Hollandaise sauce wasn't lemony enough for me and had the flavor more of chicken stock base. It was good but not great. The avocado on my omelet was almost at the end of its life but still okay enough to eat. Like I said the food was really good, no complaints. I gave this place 5 stars based on the service. The food was a solid 4 stars though.",

We were a party of 3 adult males and spent under $50 (total for all) and could barely walk after because of the amount of good food you get. Staff is extremely friendly and nice, the owner who greets every guest at the door is a very cool guy who clearly loves his restaurant and respects his guests. We went there twice for breakfast, been served by Denise the first time and by Nordes the second time. Thank you girls for the amazing service and great food! Oh, if you like eggs benedict you should try it here, it's unmatched. I had mine with steak and boy, it was good. Also tried the omelette with salsa, sour cream and avocado that Nordes recommended and it was delicious. Anyway, if I ever go to Vegas again I'm going to Mr. Mamas for another breakfast, no doubt!

She told us about the menu, her faves, etc.  The portions of food were pretty generous and the prices are very affordable. Their food is great, though not super crazy delicious and different than others, that could make me crave ilike crazy. But, the Homemade Sausage Gravy  for the Chicken Fried Steak..... the best! I am not a chicken fried steak & white gravy kind of girl, but after trying it from my friend's plate, I have to say it  was goooddddd :-) I wish there were a restaurant in my neighborhood could make that kind of gravy!",

Waited about 30 minutes to sit for a party of 2, server wasn't rude or friendly.. more towards the rude side. Under the menu sections I ordered the burrito which is under a section that says it includes toast so I asked for the toast and she rudely tells me it doesn't come with toast... confused I asked her why it was under a section that clearly shows that it comes with toast, she never explained to me just kept saying NO TOAST NO TOAST and yes she was definitely 100% fluent in english so I'm not sure why she just kept repeating that and ignoring my question.  my burrito was decent, nothing better than a typical breakfast burrito at del taco or your local mom and pop shop though, definitely not worth the drive from the strip or the wait",

    "text": "As a foodie, I really wanted to love this place.   During my trip with my boyfriend to Vegas, we stopped here for breakfast one day based on the great reviews. I would give the experience, price, and service 5 stars for sure but meal wise it's a 2 star for me.  So let's start with service and experience. When we got there, there was a line outside. But surprisingly the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. And coming from a major metropolitan, that was amazing!  When we were seated the waitress was really nice and friendly. She checked up on us and the whole 9. Taking it a step further, one of the other employees saw us taking selfies and offered to take pictures of us together. Overall, very nice people.  Now, the food. Very nicely displayed. But I got a bacon and cheddar omelette which was decent but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend bought corned beef hash and was very displeased. It had all the corned beef and no hash (felt like we were delivered some fake news).  But here is the cherry on top. We ordered a side of pancakes. It looked really good - large size and couldn't complain. We go to take a bite? And it tasted like a pancake made from mix straight out of the box. Definitely my least favorite pancakes ever.   So, I really wanted to love this place but the food deceived me. But I guess you get what you get for the price. I probably will not be returning here.",

    "text": "What an amazing breakfast place! Came here on a Sunday morning after church, around 8:45; there were a few families there, but not too busy just yet. It started getting packed with a waiting list around 10am.  The staff was friendly and kept on checking on us periodically. We had ordered a traditional eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon with a side of hash browns and Chicken fried steak with a side of hash browns and toast. The eggs Benedict was delicious; the English muffin was toasted to perfection and was a great contrast to the poached egg and the creaminess of the yolk and the hollandaise. The Canadian bacon added the bit of saltiness and extra bite the dish needed. For the CFS, it was phenomenal. The steak was tender and juicy, while still being crispy. The country gravy was filled with sausage and a hint of maple syrup, adding a great flavor to the already flavorful steak. The hash browns that accompanied both dishes were very crispy and well prepared as well.  Overall, great experience and one of the better breakfast places in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is a cute little diner with very good prices. The food was AMAZING, but I definitely was not a fan of the customer service.   I would suggest getting there early because you will have to wait. The line was out the door and everyone was just hanging out up front waiting to be called in. The wait for the food is definitely worth it.   The place itself is nothing fancy. Super casual feel, definitely do not need to dress up. If anything wear comfy clothes because the portions are really big.   I ordered the Mama's Breakfast burrito and It is to die for. I pushed myself to eat both half because it was THAT good.   The only reason I am not giving Mr. Mama's a 5 (which they deserve for their food) is because of their customer service. I would give them a 2.5/3. I understand that they are busy and they need to make sure people are going in and out efficiently, but I saw multiple instances where they did not treat customers very well. Personally, after being served our burrito our waited came back in about 5 mins to ask how the food was (which was nice), but it wasn't even another 10 mins before they brought the check. I was not even done with the first half of my burrito. They did say that their was no rush, but it felt like they were telling us that we needed to hurry and leave so they could serve other people.   Again, the food is AMAZING and I will definitely be going back. But their customer service is lacking.",

It was our last day there and we were looking for a family friendly breakfast spot, with good prices,  off the strip. So happy we found this place.   We walked right in and got sat at a table quickly. I ordered coffee and water and a Denver omelette with fried potatoes. This plate was huge! I could only get halfway through it, but it was good. I also ordered my girls the 2 pancakes, bacon and egg plate to split. Again,  another large portion (not complaining at all), I got to eat some of their pancakes and, they too, tasted so good!!! My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and was very happy with it as well.  Employees were all very friendly, and efficient. I think we even met the owner who stopped by our table to chat for a second.   Overall, good homestyle eating and great prices for the plates you're served. I'd come back again for sure! Children's menus would be a great addition, mine always love to color, but we got by as well.   Thanks for a great experience.",

So \"Sean\" (the host at Mr. Mamas) suggested that we; checkout Rolling Smoke BBQ... WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!   Later that night we go have dinner at Gordan Ramsey's Burger (Amazing). Bump into friends there (more derby fam) and they tell us Gordon is across the street at his new Hells Kitchen spot. So we haul butt over there just to miss him and current contestants.  While we were there we had it set in our minds we would come back for breakfast Sunday morning seeing as they already had 600 reservation for lunch and dinner that night.  But Sunday morning as I am getting dressed to head over there I remember Mr. Mamas. So glad I got to experience this place. Everything we ordered was perfect. The staff? Great. The layout? Great. Food? A+  There was nothing I had an issue with. Not even the prices. I cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "The BEST breakfast food that I've ever had.  I don't remember where I got wind of this place but it was in my bookmarks and I suggested it the crew on our way out of Vegas.  It has a mom & pops feel but you can tell they pay extra attention to the small details.  A host opened the door for us as we walked in and immediately sat us down.  We ordered a cinnamon roll, a pair of chicken fried steaks, an omelette (I forget which), and a biscuits and gravy meal.  They started us off with the cinnamon roll which you could tell was definitely not store bought.  In my opinion, almost all cinnamon rolls out there are all icing and some bread.  This was was made with the correct amount of cinnamon and not completely drenched in icing.  It actually tasted like a pastry, not a dessert.  Their gravy is made with sausage, bacon, and a touch of maple syrup.  It was not runny in any way, shape or form; to the point where you could spoon it on with a fork.  By far the best breakfast gravy I've ever had.  The subtle sweetness of the gravy complemented and cut through the saltiness of the chicken fried steak.  It tones down the saltiness of the gravy itself making it that much more enjoyable.  The friend that got the omelette was surprised by the amount of veggies/stuffing she had in it.  From the picture, you can see that veggies were coming out through the egg.  She said it was so satisfying that it wasn't just a few springs of spinach with 4 eggs.  Also note our \"extra crispy\" hashbrowns.  Whenever I order them that way elsewhere, they're always soggy in the middle.  Most establishments make your hashbrowns too thick so there's too much filler in between the crispy parts.  Not here.  The hashbrowns are spread thin enough to give you a big satisfying crunch instead of just mushy potatoes.  As we were driving out here, we were wondering where the hell we were going and if it was worth ever coming here again as it is a bit out of the way, but all of us agreed that it was and is definitely worth driving 15 minutes out of the way to visit this place on the way out of Vegas.  We plan on trying the lunch menu next time.  See ya soon Mr. Mama!",

You know the food is good when there's a long wait lol. Our server was Jenna and she was amazing! You know how sometimes they forget the lemon in your water when you ask for it... or even the side of ranch to go with your fries? Yeah, not Jenna! Her service was on point AND she made sure our drinks were always filled without us even needing to ask for a refill (one of my pet peeves at restaurants).   Ordered: -Cup of chicken noodle soup= 5/5. Perfect size to start off with before my meal. Used with macaroni noodles. -French toast with side of bacon=5/5. So good! My favorite out of all we ordered and the bacon was cooked perfectly: large with a crunch. -Chili and cheese omelet= 4/5. Pretty large portion for me. -Steak and eggs= 3/5. Just your typical steak, over easy eggs, and french fries.  Would definitely be back if we're in the area and just wanting some good ol' regular breakfast.",

My husband had the pancakes and bacon. The pancakes were very large--maybe 7 inches across! You get two with the combo. He loves pancakes and finished his meal! You must go and check this place out---you won't be sorry!  Take a cooler for leftovers!",

    "text": "Been on the hunt for the best breakfast spot in Vegas and Mr.Mamas is inarguably one of my favorite breakfast spot in town. I came here on a Saturday morning and place was bustling with people which is a good sign.   Service was impeccable. One of the guy (owner?) opened the door for us as we were walking towards the entrance with a warm greeting. Place was packed but they got more than enough servers to take care of everyone. A lady came by our table and introduced herself, I'm assuming she is also the owner? Her name was something along the line of Katherine or Kathy (why am I so bad with names...smh),  I can't remember but she was extremely friendly and welcoming.   I was craving something sweet so I ordered their Mama's French Toast, which comes with 5 generous slices of toast with 3 eggs, and a choice of sausage/ham/bacon. French toast was dusted with powdered sugar but did not have any sweetness to itself. I put maple syrup to sweeten up the toast a little but quickly realized their maple syrup is not sweet at all.  Toasts were rather dry and the dish overall was forgettable. Bacon was crispy and eggs were cooked to my liking.   In conclusion, I would give 3 stars for the food itself but based on their top-notch service, I am bumping it up to 4 stars. Thank you and will be back again!",

Over all the experience was great and this would be a location we would revisit when in Vegas.",

I simply wanted to enjoy my breakfast without looking at the server's lover backs, rubbing my table all the time. Not very esthetic . As a suggestion, to make this table more welcoming to customers they can consider room separator.   Overall, the food was good.",

He said the steak was just OK and you can tell it was recently defrosted. We were expecting something really good but got mediocre.",

Boy, oh boy, was I wrong. The wait staff was pleasant for the most part and the atmosphere was a bit noisy - but what else can you expect from a place like this? I ordered biscuits and country gravy. Due to all the raves and reviews, I thought this would be my best bet. Again, wrong! The gravy was loaded with sausage, bacon, maple syrup...which sounded amazing when our waitress described the dish. However, it was mediocre at best. The gravy was lackluster and the biscuits were very dry and dense. It got a little better when I added a ton of salt to the gravy but not much. My best friend ordered a bacon avocado burger - in which the cook staff forgot to add the bacon. Our waitress realized that it was missing and brought out a fresh plate several minutes later. Our overall experience was not great. But hey, maybe I'll give it a second chance and order something completely different. Maybe.",

When we left there was no room to get out the door because so many people were waiting to get a table!

Portion was decent.  However, when we got our bill, everything was more than the menu price.  For example, we ordered large chili bowl.   The waitress asked if we wanted cheese or onions.  My husband didn't want them but I said to have them on the side so I can have some.  It was his order.  They charged us 75 cents for this.  If we knew this is extra charge, we would've said no.  We ordered 4 dishes and every plates were charged extra for something.  The waitress didn't explain all the extra charge once.  We still left 20% tip.

You are welcomed with someone opening the door for you and walking you to your seat. Our server Melissa S. was great. The food was great breakfast food as well; the bacon was actually bacon, not like one of those chain restaurants. Two pancakes, eggs, and bacon filled me up to the point I was barely able to finish because the pancakes were huge and cooked perfectly. I would recommend this place to everyone, politeness is hard to come by in most places, but this place is overflowing with it. Keep up the great work.",

Our order was taken quickly and came out maybe 15 minutes later.  Although the cook was a little unprofessional with his yelling profanities about being slammed in the kitchen, he calmed down and our breakfast was fantastic.  It held us over all day, so much food we couldn't finish our plates.  Great price and service ultimately.  Our beverages were always kept full and hot and a good meal.  We are from out of town but will definitely make this a must have when we visit.  Thanks for a great meal!",

Biscuit and gravy was amazing. The gravy is home made with bacon, maple syrup and sausage. Can't go wrong with that combo. Service was great and even made the hash browns extra crispy as requested. All bottle of condiments were full and sitting on table. Heard French toast was good too so that will have to wait until the next visit.",

This is my second time here and I said it the first time. I ordered the Cali omelet no sausage and extra veggies. It was huge and delicious. Big enough to share, which we did, and we're gladly assisted my the friendly waitress and offered an extra plate. We also ordered one pancake which was  also huge to share at the end of our omelet. I didn't get to eat my half of pancake because I was so full.  I swear it's something they do with the eggs. They are extra fluffy and so yummy. The OJ tastes amazing and is like sticking a straw in an orange. The service and food are both 5 star worthy. Will be back again.",

I am not too picky, but i ordered the spinach omelet egg white like i saw another yelpers picture and when i opened it from the box it had the nastiest smell. Then i ordered a side of guacamole and they gave me three small slices for 2$ are you serious? give me atleast four or five slices, but three small ones which were probably like one normal slice. Yea no. I should have went to the grocery store and bought a whole one for 79 cents. Well anyways I will stick with Egg & I :)",

To start the hostess is friendly and respectful; definitely a good sign for a place you've never been to. Then, the wait time was right on target, unlike places that say a time and it takes longer; ugh.  We were seated and soon asked to move to a different table before placing our order. Not a problem though.. Kat (manager) asked so politely and apologized that is was no inconvenience. Without asking her she gave us a free cinnamon roll as a thank you. Our waiter Alex was nothing short of the impressive professionalism and kindness of all the other staff. He smiled, answered our questions, and was exceptionally attentive to our needs during our visit. Their menu has a good variety of foods that ordering was difficult because we wanted everything. When our food came out it was perfect! The taste was amazing and the family environment was the icing.. we will definitely be back anytime we're in town! If there were more than 5 stars I'd give it to them!!  Thank you Kat, Alex, cooks and all staff for your great service.",

    "text": "Hands-down my favorite breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas ... or anywhere for that matter.  Mr Mama's hits the mark for all aspects of a restaurant -- fresh quality ingredients, service, timely receipt of meals, price & value, and friendly atmosphere.  I've been here maybe 6 times over the past two years (I'm from out of town).  Each and every time, my wife and I are greeted with an open door and a welcoming Mr Mama himself or one of his staff.   The homemade corned beef is superb.  The Egg Florentine & Meat (I added the optional corned beef for an additional $2) is delicious.   And I found the Hashed Browns absolutely perfect -- golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft, warm, and tasty on the inside.  Each time, the wait staff has been very attentive and friendly.  Nobody stands around.  Each employee from the owners to the managers, to the waiters/waitresses, to the busboys work their butts off.  And Mr Mama makes the rounds to each table to thank diners for chosing his place and make sure everyone's dining experience is nothing short of great.  As I eat my food, I look around the room, watching the hustle and bustle of the employees listening to the other diners converse and laugh among themselves and interact with the enployees,  and Mr Mama bantering with his good-natured customers -- AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.  It's like watching a well choreographed dance. And the food is excellent, as well.  What a wonderful way to start the day!  Thank you Mr. Mama's!",

The interior is rather simple, I rather liked the pictures from the 30's and 40's scattered around the room. They do keep their place clean making sure the next person sitting at the table isn't stepping on or leaning on leftover food.  The food: Ordered the Greek burrito which was surprisingly excellent for a diner, a definite must try when in the mood for a burrito. The pancakes here are rather good, very fluffy unlike those that taste like cake. We also tried the french toast which was ok, nothing really special about them, if I had to pick I would stick to the pancakes for your sweet tooth. Portion sizes are ok, nothing over the top, what you order is what you get. The staff here is super friendly and happy to help making sure everything was ok and our water cups filled.   I would return here upon visiting Vegas again, good food and good people!",

    "text": "Found Mr. Mamas on a Yelp review. Decided to go and try it while in Las Vegas. We had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated but the wait was worth it. I had the breakfast quesadilla special and it was delicious. The salsa that came with it had very good flavor and a little kick to it. We also ordered the fajita special which came with beef fajitas with vegetables and eggs of your choice and diced potatoes with peppers and onions on it. The fajitas meat was very tender, juicy and tasty. The host Shawn was very welcoming and our waitress Claudia was very quick with our order and always checked up on us. I would definitely recommend Mr. Mamas.",

Very friendly staff from even before we came into the restaurant (hostess held door open for us and greeted us!) ...and its genuine, not forced. Mr Mama came to our table to greet us and welcome us to his restaurant which was pretty cool. The menu was a good selection of breakfast and lunch items. I ordered the veggie omelet w/ fruit on the side and my boyfriend ordered the chili filled omelet (sorry no pictures! we we're too hungry and dug in right away). The omelettes were delicious and tasted just like homemade.  We came in between breakfast and lunch rush so we were seated right away (I may be wrong but there seemed to be about a dozen tables so). But if you come when its busy its definitely worth the wait. The place has some neat old photos on the wall so take the time to check those out. Table is fully stocked as well, it has all the things you might need i.e. salt and pepper, ketchup, tabasco, etc. Great family friendly vibe in there.... good energy all around. Recommend Mr. Mama's for sure!  ***i was not coerced or bribed into giving this review",

(and i even tasted it to make sure he wasnt being super picky).  the corned beef hash seemed like was out of a can (and not a good brand either) the potatoes were ground up w/the cornbeef and it was just 'meh'   on a good note: - our son had the biscuits and gravy, which is his all time FAVE and everyplace he eats them he rates them on a scale from 1 to nana's (w/ nana's being the best of course) and he said they were right up there w/nana's!  in conclusion... if we do go back, we will all order the biscuits n gravy ;)",

There is a nice guy that comes around and ask if you want him to take a picture for you and he literally stood on a chair to get a good group pic for a family next to us.  Food: husband orders the steak and eggs, he said his hash browns were mushy, steak was gummy and the food did not come out hot.  I ordered the French toast, it was ok, did not come out hot either. The eggs were good and the bacon was very hard.  I wish it would have tasted better. I will give them a second chance, it may have just been because they were busy.",

I don't know what is better the food or the excellent service. The staff here has like a welcoming family vibe. They help one another out to make sure each and every guest is well taken care of.   Whenever we go to a new place we like to order all of the popular items. So we got the country fried steak, steak and eggs, French toast and of course some bacon.   Everything was 5 Stars. The gravy was seasoned on the country fried steak - which I feel is rare. The steak with the steak and eggs was super tender and moist. The French toast was AMAZING!!!! And the bacon was cooked to perfection.   The pricing here is so reasonable. I was super shocked that with everything we ordered we left paying only $40!!!!    If you are in the mood for some good breakfast and a great atmosphere I definitely recommend you to come by here.   Even a man who I assumed to be the owner went around and thanked everyone for coming in.",

Definitely recommend. Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Never have I felt so welcomed in a restaurant. My family was visiting Las Vegas from LA and we were craving some comfort food. And this place was as comfy as it gets!  My parents got their pancakes. They don't eat meat so they asked the waitress to swap out the meat for some hash-browns. The waitress didn't even think twice and happily made the substitution. And let me tell ya, these pancakes were soooo fluffy.  I got their tuna melt on marble rye and my husband got the pastrami on marble rye. They were both out of this world. Perfectly toasted bread with the juiciest pastrami pieces. The tuna melt was great too, not too much mayo in the spread.   What made this meal even better was the great, bubbly owner who made rounds and spoke to all his customers. What a great, jolly man!   Will definitely be stopping here again when we are back in town!",

I did not like veggie wrap, it has an overdose of eggs.  I always pair my food with orange juice, which they don't squeeze in-house, but get from a vendor everyday. They have huge portion size for both entree and side orders. Side Salad is okay, fruit salad is good, both big enough to be shared.",

He has the most up-beat, friendly, and warm personality. His smile and attitude towards everyone made me wonder what it was like to work here. Was it just him who's just so genuinely happy or was there some kind of amazing benefits package to be an employee here? 10 stars for customer service.   Now, onto the food. The steak & eggs were both cooked just right, with the steak being tender and juicy to the core. The corned beef and eggs was delicious, as well. Although the corned beef was cooked a little differently from what I've had in the past. It was a little more fried up and I actually preferred this over the past corned beef I've had. Toast was buttered up so nicely, I kid you not, I think I had 4-5 whole slices.   Keep up that upbeat and warm welcome, Mr. Mama! I don't know your name (I should have asked), but I bet you that many people return not just for the delicious food, but for the customer service too.",

The front house staff and kitchen staff seem to work seamlessly to get people seated and fed.

Omelettes so full of flavor. French toast that melts in your mouth. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Hot chocolate with whipped cream and chocolate syrup drizzled. Home fries that just hit the spot in the savory department. The value of the meal is always excellent. We went there for my daughter's birthday last week. She wore a \"birthday girl\" crown. The employees wished her a happy birthday and next thing we knew, they were bringing her a huge, delicious cinnamon roll singing the Birthday song! Such a fond memory. A few weeks ago we were there and Nick, the owner, went to each table to personally visit. We loved how warm and personable he was with us in sharing stories.

Our server Jenna was very patient and such a sweetheart - giving us samples of the special corned beef, which was amazing. We ordered the mini cinnamon buns and they happened to be a little hard. Jenna came back and apologized. Then Kat (I hope I got her name right) came and apologized and said the chef has something special for us. Jenna came out with an Irish cheesecake which we were very thankful for. Then the chef came back with two deep fried cinnamon buns. Omg so mouth watering, so decadent. Everything was so flavorful- from the corned beef benedict, the savory chicken fried steak, the home style fries (perfectly fried with crispy outside and soft center and seasoned to perfection). The outstanding service made you feel like you were at home and the food satisfied our bellies and our souls. If I could give 10 stars I would. An experience that we will definitely never forget. To everyone at Mr Mamas thank you for all your hospitality and amazing food.",

    "text": "Mr. Mamas has been serving the Vegas community for years on the Decatur side, until their semi-recent expansion to this part of town in the good ol Spanish Palms retail plaza (aka strip mall palooza). They haven't lost a beat with their newer surroundings, as they serve some of the best breakfast in the city while providing incredible service all at the same time.  Their new spot is one giant dining room space; complete with the retro black and white checkered floor tile (#1) and a number of tables for all groups and sizes. There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.  Their menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.  I took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.  A huge shout out to the owners / management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits. On the front of their menu there is a (extremely cheesy) quote that reads: \"Our Place Will Put A Smile On Your Face.\" Truth.  Review #3100 is in the books. To 5 stars and many more adventures in hashbrowns. __________ (#1) Presumably from when this place was the 50's Diner: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/50s-diner-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/50s-diner-l...</a>",

Finally, some food that's already seasoned! The corned beef hash had just the right amount of crunch to it and full of flavor.  The chicken fried steak was smothered in sausage gravy that makes you smack your lips.  The way the hostess called out table numbers and had the staff orchestrated, Gordon Ramsey  would be in awe. Absolute clockwork!  And you know a local place is good when one of the Property Brothers eats there! Yep,  one of the brothers was having his breakfast at Mr. Mama's!  So why not a 5? Well, the diced peppers and onions could've been more chunky (they were almost pureed) and the steak was just a tad soft. But that's it. The flavor of everything was delicious!",

They are Yelp friendly and we got a free drink for checking in.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I had the chicken friend steak and eggs with gravy.  The waitress let me try their unique gravy to ensure I would like it.  It has ground sausage, bacon and a hint of maple.  I thought I would like it but was pleasantly supposed at how tasty it was.      The chicken fried steak was a ground patty with a lightly spiced flour coating.  It came perfectly cooked and was crisp and not oily.  The oil had to have been at the perfect temperature and fresh.  The gravy on top was plentiful and made the dish a treat.  The eggs were prefect over easy and just the way I like them.  I love hash browns and their were homemade and very good.  They lightly salt so had to add some but understand that not everybody loves salt like I do.  Great place to start your day as they know how to do a great breakfast!",

    "text": "***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 38/100***  Browsing thru my bookmarked places, Mr. Mamas got the majority's vote to try for my daughters birthday breakfast. We arrived around 9 am on a Monday, I was dreading the anticipated long line as I've heard and read rave reviews about this place. Luckily, there was only a few people ahead of us and we only had to wait a couple of minutes.  As far as the menu, it was pretty straight forward and not extensive. I didn't see any waffles, crepes or eggs benedict.   I give the food 3 stars and an extra one for good service. Our waitress Crystal was helpful and she constantly checked on us, though she seemed distracted at times. We mentioned it was our first time and asked for popular dishes ordered. She suggested the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs with sausage gravy which she asked if I wanted to try first in case it wasn't to my liking, I thought that was very nice of her so I wouldn't be stuck with something I didn't like. She also brought us a complementary Cinnamon roll for the birthday girl to try. They didn't have any specialty pancakes but she said they can put chocolate chips if we wanted. She asked if I wanted onions and peppers with my home fries and I said sure, but what she failed to mention was that all those add ins (chocolate chips, onions and peppers) were add on charges as well. It wasn't a big deal for us when I saw the bill but I could see potential issues arise. Also ordered by our party was the Corned beef hash, Western Omelet, and Buttermilk pancakes with bacon and eggs. I can't say the food was extraordinary after all it's breakfast fare and it's kind of hard to screw that up. Though I will say the pancakes were fluffy and the bacon thick, extra crispy and delicious.  Their hospitality more than anything is what makes them popular with tourists and locals alike. Looking forward to a follow up visit to try their other offerings.  ***TIP: You can't use your purchased deal and claim your free check in offer at the same time.",

We used to go there every Sunday. Then we moved. And we have never found another place like it. But if you live here, this probably IS the good breakfast spot.   Anyway, I digress. My complaint is the food was not good. The has Browns were crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside- clearly cooked frozen. Boyfriend's omelet had very little of the things he asked for and an excess amount of spinach. The pancakes were actually ok but they were very bready.   I just wish we could find a good place.",

Crispy steak and a unique sausage (and bacon?) gravy that had a sweetness to it.  Ordered the hash browns crispy. Probably didn't need the toast that came with it. The scrambled eggs needed to be cooked in salted butter (they were missing that buttery taste). Lots of other things on the menu that looked good too. Long wait, but worth it.",

That corn beef sandwich with provolone cheese was sooooooo Ono (good)!!! The meat was so tender, it almost melted in our mouths. The French toast was cooked perfectly and the hash browns with cheese...I wish I would've ordered a double order they were cooked to perfection!  The owner Nick, greeted us at the door. He even stopped by the table to check on us frequently. He took time out of his busy day and sat down with us and gave us advice about opening our own business in the future.  Anytime I'm in Vegas, I'll make sure we stop here. The location was spacious and as soon as I walked in it was a very warm, friendly environment.",

We were told the wait was 20 minutes but they got us seated in about 10. I ordered the Cali omelette which had sour cream, avocado, and pico de Gallo. My friends also got biscuits and gravy, cinnamon bun, and the Western omelette. The omelettes that we got were very bland so they needed a bit more salt or seasoning. My other friends did not like the taste of the gravy either. However, the home fries, toast, and cinnamon bun were very good! Maybe we came on an off day but we are likely not coming back if we go to Vegas again after such a disappointing brunch :(",

He said that so n so was going to seat us.  So she sat us at our table, and told us what our waitress name was, and that she will be right with us.  Everyone was so nice there.  So I got the Jenna breakfast wrap, it was good, I just expected it to be a little spicier because of the jalapenos.  But it was still good.  My hubby loved his steak and eggs.  As we were eating the guy at the door came over and checked on us, to see if everything was good.  Also one of the waitress came over as well and made sure everything was ok.   Then later, the guy came back that was at the door, and started chit chatting with us.  Come to find out he was Mr. Momma! (he was the guy at the door)   We love this spot.  I think we will become regulars here.",

It was a thick blanket of sausage in white sauce.",

When it's not busy the service is a little better but for the most part everyone seems to be a little scattered. You'll walk in, multiple people will be waiting (there's also not really a waiting area at all), and it looks like like the hostess/cashier/takeout taker is always frantically looking for help or for other people to listen to her. It just seems a little unorganized which causes you to be sat and then no one comes to help you because they're so busy the server doesn't realize their sat OR once I was sat and because there was no communication 4-5 servers asked me my drink order. Overall the food is good and affordable and if you want a no fuss breakfast where you sit and leave this is the place to go.",

Great bread on the sandwich with great turkey. But I am a burger aficionado. I was very surprised how good their burger is. Great ratio in the meet, obviously not frozen and seasoned to perfection. When you want just a classic burger this is a great spot. Service was also great. After going a few times you'll know you're in a family run business. The only reason it's not five stars is because it did not make my brain explode but that's very rare! This is an excellent place if you're looking for great service, food and prices. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Our first stop for breakfast after relocating to Vegas and it did not disappoint.  The customer service was stellar,  from being greeted at the door upon walking up, our exceptionally kind server, and being thanked upon our exit, we felt the gratification and kindness just for being a patron. The food was a wonderful start to our day.  We went in heavy because of needing something to carry us through the unloading of our moving truck later that day, and Mr. Mamas delivered with huge portions for every order. I had the eggs Benedict, a favorite I can't turn down, and it was fantastic. The ham was hearty and thick. The eggs were poached beautifully.  My daughter ordered their cinnamon roll, hashbrowns, and a hot chocolate. The cinnamon roll is gigantic! She is still talking about the hot chocolate being the BEST she has ever had a week later. We tried out the biscuits and gravy and again,  that plate is going to fill your belly! They definitely have a different take on the classic sausage country style gravy, with other meats in it and maple syrup too. It was too sweet for my husband's liking, but I found that with a little salt it balanced well and worked. My baby is a pancake guy so we chose a short stack for him with eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns. We were cautioned that the pancakes were large and they weren't kidding.  Fluffy plate sized pancakes! I will add that his over medium eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! Most places can't do them without crisping the whites and we hate that, but these were gorgeous! Finally,  I will note that my coffee was so good.  I don't know if it was because I was in dire need of caffeine, but this was better than your standard, weak cafe cuppa joe. Good flavor and strong enough to withstand my love of cream! If I had one critique, it would be that the table was a little too tight for four people with all the plates we had going on, so next time we might ask to take away the condiments in the center to help give a little more room.  Nothing to grimace about though and we will absolutely be back!",

We also got a steak and eggs breakfast that was good. The eggs Benedict was great. Our server was very friendly and helpful. She recommended a ranch to visit for our kid and the service was extraordinary.",

The pancakes were tasty and filling, my friend had the biscuits with gravy and he said they were very good.  Others in my group had 2 different omelette sand they were both satisfied with their meals.   It's not to close to the strip but it is worth the drive.",

Add to the fact that there was a $15 for $30 voucher and I would give this place 6 stars. Overall, great food for a reasonable price. I had the basic but very delicious Mama Short Stack with Ham. Got the ham and it was done to perfection. Savory with all the juices still inside. In addition my pancakes were just about as awesome as you can get! They were just so FLUFFY! Overall, great place, great food, great atmosphere and the owner comes by and chats with you as well! Wish there were more hometown breakfast places like this in Vegas!",

The restaurant is well run and well staffed.  I watched a very young man scrub, not wipe, table after table as he prepared them for their next customers.  The man in charge of staging the wait and filling the tables did a great job and even came around at the end of the meal to make sure we were pleased.  My wife had the breakfast wrap and thought it was excellent.  I had the western omelet and pondered the choice between hash browns and potatoes.  I chose the hash browns and was a little disappointed.  They had a watery taste and I suspect the were steamed on the grill with water and a cover to ensure they stayed moist.  The problem was all the water was not cocked out and it diluted the oil normally used to give top hash browns their best taste.  The western omelet was very good.  Next time I will try the potatoes.  The final bill was about $21 and well worth the price.",

It is obvious he cares about his restaurant and his customers. He even shared a great spot to visit off the strip. The only trouble was that in moving to a beautiful  new location/restaurant the address changed. Unfortunately yelp would not roll over the old site to the new address. We would have gone to the wrong address and missed out on a great breakfast. Be sure to visit the south jones blvd address!! Yelp, please roll over all the reviews to the new Mr. Mama's site.

It was an excellent start to our morning! I'm a light eater in the morning so I was aiming for something small. I ordered the half order of biscuit and sausage gravy. I don't know how our waitress picked up on this, but she asked me if I wanted to sample the gravy first. She told me their gravy was a bit on the heavier side and wanted to make sure I loved my food. She got me a quick sample, and I couldn't be happier. I don't know what they put in there but it's DELICIOUS. It wasn't overly  runny, nor was heavily caked on my biscuit. It was amazing!!

The place ran very efficiently while we were there. I like the fact that they have pamphlet style menus for you to look at while you are waiting, a great way to save time! We came on a Sunday morning, only had about a 15 minute wait. Maybe the church crowds hadn't arrived yet, I'm not sure. It wasn't horribly busy while we were there. They did have a ton of staff working, easily in the high teens which seemed like a lot for what seemed like a smaller place. The food was really good. I had the Marty wrap, lots of great flavor and a balanced amount of every ingredient. The wife had the chicken fried steak, which was spectacular! I know because I tried a bite, or five. The steak was tender, flavorful and they were able to keep it crispy even after the wonderful gravy they top it with. The gravy had to be made in house, it tasted home made and had sizable chunks of sausage in it. Coffee tasted like standard swill, but we did notice it was freshly ground. This place is proof that the locals know where to go when it comes to good food. Yes, tourists have to venture off the strip but c'mon, be adventurous just once in your life and check this place out!!",

My daughter and I both had eggs benedict, and our yolk was cooked in 3 out of the 4 eggs. Our waitress never came and asked how stuff was. Not to mention the fact that she mumbled when she took our order and left the check. No bright personality or hospitality from her. Not impressed, expected a lot more from this place",

Several of the other staff came by our table to say hello as well and asked us where we were from.  Claudia took our food order very nicely and accommodated any of the plates to our liking. I got the Cali Omelette, which consisted of, Cheddar Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Avocado and Sour Cream. I ordered the hash browns instead of the potatoes as well with wheat toast ! Omg! This was so delicious, when cutting the omelette you could see the cheese was melted just right! The avocado was very fresh and the sausage was seasoned to perfection!!! The hash browns were cooked to a golden brown, although I like my hash browns extra crispy, these were delicious!! This entree just went perfectly with the fresh orange juice they carry!!

    "text": "Had sunday breakfast and were early shortly after opening, there were already people seated and eating!    One kid had the special strawberry french toast which was a huge portion of like 6 half thick texas toast, the side of scrambled eggs and 2 thin sausage patties.  Other kid had the steak and eggs with french fries.  The steak was thin and fatty and not very flavorful, and she didn't like the fries.  I enjoyed the denver omelet with hash browns and the hubby enjoyed the corned beef hash.  Everybody in the diner was super friendly from the owner who was walking around talkin to everyone to the servers constantly looking after us and picking up our used plates.  This was great service and the food portions are huge.  The kiddos also enjoyed some hot cocoa and chocolate milk.",

Good thing we did as the place was hopping and it filled up before you could say Blackberry Specials!!! We loved the fluffy buttermilk pancakes which nestled the fresh blackberries and butter on top. Eggs were perfect. I heard the sausages were nice- but they disappeared so fast I had to take my husband's word. Coffee was good and plentiful as was the service. Mr. Mama came around to say hello which is a welcome touch.  Definitely enjoy the old school clean breakfast cafe ambience with warm welcomes to match!!",

Totally worth the drive and if you have to wait for a table, it's worth the wait. We were lucky enough to be seated right away. EVERYBODY was super happy and friendly (looks like the employees really like being there). We ordered Mama's short stack, biscuits and gravy, bacon and eggs and french toast. All were superb. The gravy has bacon and sausage and a little maple syrup -it's delish. We joked with our server, Lordes, that my husband spills and she said she didn't have a sippy cup, but gave him a napkin bib. When I went to take a picture of it, Sean (one of the Misters at Mr Mama's) grabbed my camera, stepped two tables away, grabbed somebody's empty chair and stood on it, then took a delightful photo of the four of us with our platters of food in front of us. . I asked if he would follow us around to be our professional photographer, but he said he had a restaurant to run - HA. Anyway, Mr. Mama's is fantastic. This goes on our list of favorite restaurants in Vegas for a good solid, hearty, fun breakfast experience.",

Because of hunger I never waited haha today we went around 130 but they still let us sit down and order. Even though they were closing soon, they did not rush us and make us feel like we had to hurry. I really appreciated that. A friend and I had gotten omelettes and the boyfriend got corned beef hash with breakfast potatoes. They were all pretty good. They all came out in a timely manner. They were constantly checking to see if we needed anything or wanted refills or if our food was okay. Very attentive staff which is also a plus. In terms of breakfast food, it was good but not waiting outside for an hour great tho. I was kind of relieved that I had not waited all those other times we had come here. This place is definitely better than Denny's but not better than some other breakfast places I've tried. If you want a simple omelette or other breakfast foods, come here but if you want a foodgasm, then I wouldn't recommend this place. I'll come again tho if the line isn't long!!",

    "text": "I've never been to their restaurant, but I have Postmates deliver Mr. Mamas quite often. What initially drew me in was the banner Postmates uses for Mr. Mamas. It is, of course, a photo of one of their out-of-this-world cinnamon rolls, dripping in white icing and already half-eaten. These sweet treats do not last long once they are within my, or any one of my various roommates', reach.   I've also tried the French toast which was fabulous, as well as the bacon, country fried steak and eggs. No need for anything fancy, Mr. Mamas just knows how to do breakfast the way it's supposed to be.    The other day, as I was placing a Postmates order for what I think was the second or third day in a row, I decided to use a little forethought and added a couple bowls of chili to stash until dinner time or whenever one of us realizes that there's food left unattended and unspoiled in the fridge, Ultimately I ended up reheating a bowl for a hungry friend. Even though at least two or three days had passed since the cheese atop this mound of thick and hearty chili was freshly melted, my friend said it was the bomb-diggedy.   This place is the cat's pajamas! Don't pass up any opportunity to enjoy a real, down home, made-with-love meal here that won't soon be forgotten! Bring your whole family for Sunday brunch, order a single cinnamon bun and have it delivered by Postmates, or stop by for that home sweet home kinda feeling and get your mama fix.",

I'm lazy and don't want to leave the hotel so early in the morning but will go out of my way to come to this spot every time we are in Vegas! First off the guy at the front greeted and opened the door for us and put our name on the list giving us a fifteen minute wait... It didn't even take that long and we were already seated. Starving we asked the girl who took our drink order of we can put an order in for a cinnamon roll right away and she politely told us we she was not our waitress but would let us know. The waitress showed up informing us our roll would come out soon and was super patient while me and my husband were being indecisive. She offered us a sample of the corned beef after explaining the cooking process and a sample of the gravy to help us make a decision. She was super sweet and accommodating. We got the sample and went with the corned beef. It was delicious along with the super soft amazing cinnamon roll. The corned beef is not what I'm used to as a Filipino I love the canned one with rice, but it was sooooo good! Super quick in and out service, love the new location with better parking! The hostess walked us out and was personable and amazing. I love this place and highly recommend it to anybody visiting Vegas!",

Not sure, I did not see any of the staff that i am used to seeing. The Corned Beef hash was just chopped up corn beef, the Toast was Dry ( sorry not into toast like Elwood Blues ) and the bacon was WAY over done.  Sad because this used to be such a great place for Breakfast.  :(  And BTW the manager asked be about my problem and offered to take off the coffee? really? don't insult me.",

The staff was super friendly and immediately took our drink order, as our waitress brought us our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order, which we were. I had a sandwich with a side salad and my companion had an omelet with English muffins on the side. The waitress typed in our order in an iPad mini, I don't think five minutes had passed by when I see her coming with my salad and the English muffins, but she also had my toasted sandwich AND the omelet!! We were shocked at how quickly our food was brought, I had barely gotten back from washing my hands, lol. The SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING!!! I'm a Vegas local and happened to be in the area due to my family member being at the hospital near by, and with out a doubt, this restaurant's SERVICE IS THE BEST I'VE HAD IN VEGAS!!! My glass didn't even go half way down when it was refilled, we were constantly asked if we needed anything, if everything was satisfactory, if we were being treated correctly ...?!! Food was delicious, very fresh and just made. My sandwich was was still hot from being toasted, the veggies were very fresh and crisp, and even though everything was very quickly served, the food was neatly arranged on our plates. The omelet was very fresh, fluffy and delish from what my company mentioned. I will definitely come back to Mamas without a doubt.",

Of course, the first time I did, the line was already out the door (Hey, that's a good sign!) so I skipped out and tried a different day. I think the trick is to get there early (8am-ish on the weekend) because the place gets really busy. I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs, home fries, and sourdough toast. The service overall was very good, and the owner walks around checking up on people. Sometimes I think this can be weird, but in this case, I loved it because he seemed very genuine. The home fries were so delicious, and the orange juice tasted fresh. Definitely one of the best breakfast spots on this side of town!",

I have been here twice on two separate Vegas trips and the customer service has been some of the best I've ever experienced, BOTH TIMES.  We walked up to the door, and were happily greeted by an employee who held the door open for us and welcomed us as we entered. The cashier then smiled and said good morning as we were directed to another employee waving at us from our awaiting table. Our server, Jacqui, greeted us within a minute, and took our orders with a smile.   The food took about 10 minutes to come out and about 10 minutes later, I was a very happy, very full customer. They promptly kept the table clear of empty plates, and Jenna asked if we wanted water to go as we left.  My personal favorite: The Greek Omelette is on point! 4 eggs, hash browns, a large, free pancake on the side, and all of it delicious!",

The customer service was the best that I have ever encountered! This facility works as a team and they get the job done! If you ever feel like customer service is completely dead, go to Mr. Mamas and you will see that great customer service still exists!!",

French toast was perfectly cooked and flavor was on point.  Biscuits were flaky and moist gravy had tons of sausage  and lightly seasoned yummy . Hash browns were the best I've ever had . You can't go wrong with this place . If your looking for great food alittle off the strip this is the place to come for good food at a great price . It was so good we ate there two days in a row on our visit to Vegas for super bowl weekend. Next time we visit this is our spot . Definitely getting their homemade cinnamon roll looked amazing",

But I did not find anything special about this place. The food was average. Chicken fried steak with gravy on the side was ok. The breading was hella thick and the taste was average. Pancakes were pretty good. I think it's really hard to mess up pancakes, so they were good but nothing draw dropping. Eggs sunny side up with sausage, meh. Again nothing outstanding. I think I only ate half of the sausage patty because it tasted like it was a frozen sausage patty that was heated up. French Toast I expected more from. I LOVE French Toast but the one here did not stand out at all. I wish they would of put some berries on top or something to make it interesting. Nothing really stood out enough to return but may be one day...",

There were at least four parties ahead of us at the time, but they were all seated within 5 minutes which was great!  My boyfriend and I were immediately seated and our waitress offered us beverages. I ended up ordering the French Toast w/ Sausage and a side order of hash browns while he ordered the Chili and Cheese Omelette w/ a side of hash browns as well.  Now, my food was delicious! But before eating, my boyfriend had found a long hair in his omelette and a couple of small twigs in his hash browns. I get it, sometimes things like that happen (well I'm really not sure about the random twigs), but when your entire order has some issues, it's a bit of a nuisance and it's difficult to enjoy your food.",

It did not hit the spot for me, so I decided to try to this place again. This time, at their new location. It's even closer to my house now. The service is good. They always checked up on our table & always made sure our waters were filled. I ordered the Western omelet with hash browns this time. The hash browns were my favorite part because they were so crispy & delicious. However, the omelette was okay. Nothing spectacular or something that I would crave. The prices are pretty decent as well. Many people write 5 star reviews for this place, so I guess I just have to see which foods are most popular. I wouldn't mind giving it one more shot to find that one item that truly satisfies me. :)",

    "text": "I'm writing this last review as a reply to the owner Nick concerning the situation that happened last Saturday. You claimed that you were never informed about the potato being rotten but that is actually False. As I exited the bathroom the first thing I heard from your voice was loud and clear, \"Are you going to pay?\" This is before me and my boyfriend were able to explain anything. I remember because I was actually upset and crying and none of your employees stopped to ask what was wrong. Except the manger, but I assume he felt like his hands were tied behind his back in this situation. After you asked such an off-setting question Daniel was feeling extremely upset because of how upset I was from placing a rotten potato in mouth. Clearly he did not have the answer you wanted or even had an answer at all at first because it was such bad timing. Daniel told me that he did in fact present the potatoes to you in a napkin that you grabbed and threw away and you told him to leave if he wasn't paying. Now if I'm being honest, me and Daniel never had any intention of not paying we just wanted to know what happened to the potatoes but it seemed like us not paying was your only concern which escalated the situation. Daniel is nowhere near a violent person but on the other hand you were in his face and you did physically rush him to leave the store from \"not paying\". You threaten him by claiming you were an ex fighter, you never gave him person space while leaving the store and you shouted telling us to get out. I felt like my boyfriend was in a position that any human would have gotten extremely upset in. And this is a scene which all of your employees and customers witnessed but it's a shame if they agree with us they could lose their job so of course the situation is biased. I even have pictures of me and Daniel having a wonderful (non threatening) time in your restaurant right before the incident, which if I can figure out how to post them I will. We also loved our waiter and my Jenna wrap was perfect so basically the situation could've been a lot different if you had just put the customer first instead of counting pennies and being so concerned about us paying or not. But right now it's your word against ours but the situation is now in the past. We just felt like  after the cops left our side of the story was not being heard or understood. (The cops did agree with me and Daniel that you were a hot head even towards them but that is besides the point.) Like I said in the beginning this was one of our top 5 breakfast joints until this terrible memory that I will never be able to look past.   (This is an update from re-reading your first reply, I would also like to clarify that we were never charged with anything from the cops so that is a False statement from you. The cops let us go because they realized how ridiculous the entire encounter was. If we were truly being as threatening as you claim then the cops would have taken different precautions. Thank you and goodbye.)  3:07pm August 31st 2017",

    "text": "I've been here twice and after the first time it took me over a year to return and now they have moved locations. The first time I went it was a weekend and they were busy but there were plenty of wait staff. My husband had the country fried steak and it was good. My meal was forgettable (Greek omelette).   The second time was a weekday morning and about more than half of the tables were full. I noticed something odd that I couldn't help but pay attention to. There were 8 tables full and 10 plus waiters. It was noticeably odd. Maybe they have a huge crowd come in at lunch and they were preparing for that. Then I thought maybe they have a training or meeting. Well I didn't see that happen either. What bothered me was this. I had a server named Melissa who was MIA our entire meal. We had to flag her down for water, for sugar free syrup, lemon, etc. we had to ask other people to get her because she was in conversations with other workers which did not appear to be work related talk. Upon noticing that I noticed every worker was in groups of 2 or 3 huddling around and talking not even looking at their tables. I could be judging here but honestly it didn't seem professional and I felt like a burden anytime I asked for anything. At one point our waitress rolled her eyes when we had to ask another waiter for the check and he said he would let her know. I'm not sure why she's annoyed when she's not doing her job. She was not the only one though. All I can think is that this kind of behavior is acceptable at this restaurant and chit chat between workers is acceptable as well.   As for the food- my omelette was called a Spanish omelette and it had mozzarella cheese with spinach and Parmesan cheese with avocado on top. I'm not sure what part was Spanish about it. The hash browns I asked for extra crispy and it was soggy with extra crispy on the outside. Overall my meal was 3 stars but the service was 1 star.",

The gentleman who greeted and sat us was friendly and, quite simply, great at his job! He chatted with us while we waited for a table, asking where we were from and telling us about the delicious things on the menu.  Once seated, another friendly fellow thanked us for coming and asked us if it was our first visit, which it was. He recommended a few items and told us to let him know if we needed anything. I've since learned via yelp that he is the owner. His energy was amazing. We watched him make his way to every single table while we were there.   Immediately after that, our server, Lourdes, welcomed us, told us about the specials, and made some recommendations. She was a perfect server. I drink lots of water and she was right there with the water pitcher before I even had to ask for refills. Throughout our meal she checked on us and paid attention to our needs.   While waiting for our food, we watched how the dining area ran like a perfectly oiled machine. There was excellent communication between the front door folks, the servers, owner, kitchen, and bus boy, who wasted no time getting to each table when it was vacated.   My husband had the chicken fried steak, which was the best he had ever had. My Greek omlet was terrific. Both the hash browns and home fries were fantastic.  Mr. Mamas has the best service in all of Las Vegas! We are locals, who have eaten our way across most of town, so I know what I'm talking about. We will definitely return!",

It was so wonderful,  we went back again today!!  The coffee was delicious! We had French toast,  hashbrowns,  bacon, biscuits and gravy,  and various sandwiches. The owner was very excitable and appreciative to all the customers. That attitude and great food always makes anyone want to come back!

    "text": "Ok so I'm not sure what I'm missing... did I come in a bad day? I saw all the reviews on this place and thought that there was no way I could miss out. Came here about a week and a half ago in the middle of the week. Not much of a crowd so we were seated immediately.  Definitely a working class environment. Gives you a break from the strip and the tourist vibe for sure. One thing we did notice was the cleanliness of the restaurant. About half the tables were set and a lot of the other tables still hadn't been cleared or bussed.   We were handed menus and our drink order was taken. About 10 minutes later our server finally came back and abruptly asked us what we are going to have. No suggestions, no asking if it was our first time, nothing really above and beyond for service.  We decided to try out a few things. A lot of the reviews said the biscuits and gravy were to day for us so we had an order of that. I give this a 2/5. The gravy was slightly bland. A mediocre style country gravy with sausage. The biscuits is where I had my issue. The biscuits themselves were very dense and bland as well. Not flaky at all and no real taste of buttermilk.  I had a Greek omelette. I believe it was the Greek. Had spinach tomatoes onions and feta cheese. The egg was overcooked. The egg was extremely dry. And the amount of ingredients in it was very scarce. Hardly any feta cheese except for the pieces falling out. Another 2/5.  Ordered the French toast. Was I surprised at the portion size. It literally looked like two pieces of wonder bread that had been slightly dipped in egg batter and thrown on the grill dinner plate. You won't find any of that large brioche style French toast here are thick juicy pieces of bread. Another 2/5.  Last was the California omelette or something along that lines. Vegetarian with avocado on top. Same thing as the last omelette. Very dense and dry. Eggs are definitely over cooked. Hashbrowns are decent. Pretty sure their bag frozen not fresh but still tasted OK. Gave this I'm at a three out of five.  We would've said something to the waitress but as soon as the food came we never saw her again until she came back to abruptly drop the check with half of our food still on the plates.  Like I said, we really wanted to like this place but didn't see what the hype is about. Slightly above grade of Denny's but there's a few other places in the area that are a little bit better and are at the same price point. But hey to each there own.",

Pancakes - I would give a 4 star. Kids chose to have chocolate chips (extra charge for that, wish the waitress mentioned that every add on was a charge). They were huge and looked delicious but were a little doughy.   Eggs and potatoes - 5 star. Eggs were Perfectly cooked, soft and creamy. Probably the best hash browns I had. I love that we were asked exactly how we wanted our potatoes, and I wanted crispy and that's exactly how it was served.  Orange juice was freshly squeezed.   Overall Good breakfast place but I missed the WOW factor.",

My Husband and I have been trying breakfast places around town on the weekends, and this past weekend we made it to Mr Mamas. I'd heard wonderful things about it, but never made it in until now. I'm sure glad we did!  We were there on a Saturday morning around 9:30AM and it was PACKED. Don't let the crowd turn you away - the tables turn over quickly, and although we were quoted about a 30 minute wait, we probably didn't even wait half of that time.   Our server was very friendly and helpful. My Hubby loves omelets and said that the veggie omelet he had here was one of the best ever. I had a bite and can agree, it was really yummy! I had the chicken fried steak and found the gravy to be super interesting - it has bacon, sausage and maple syrup in it, which really gives it a different flavor. It was a fairly large portion and I couldn't finish it all.  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will definitely be back. I'm sad that it's taken me so long to visit Mr Mamas!!",

Even before walking in, I felt the hospitality when an employee greeted us and opened the door for our party to come in. It was a Tuesday morning so we were seated right away even though the restaurant was about 80% capacity.  Every single employee we dealt with while we there was mad nice & courteous, a couple times I had to do a double take & ask myself if this was real? Lol. The coolest part is that Mr. Mamas himself came over to our table to introduce himself and asked if everything was going well & if there was anything they could do. Now that is customer service!  Now on to the food, everyone enjoyed what they ordered and felt that the quantities were copious. The pancakes they have here are fucking huge, I noticed the strawberries they use for the toppings were fresh and not that mushy old jam looking shit. The steak & eggs I ordered was great and had perfect grill marks. Not even the places I've paid $19 for the same plate can get it right like these guys can.   I'll definitely be back next time in Vegas, it's one of those places I won't be passing up anymore.",

I went with the  Cali Omelet- Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage Pico De Gallo , Sour Cream, topped with Avocado.   The omlette was very solid and the toast was solid as well. The service here is also very good and the owner makes it a point to make it to every table which is a nice touch.  I elected to go with the fruit bowl instead of the omelette and my 3 star rating (and not 4) is because at 4 star breakfast spots the fruit sides I've found to be diverse and generous. At Mr. Mamas the fruit cup was on the smaller side and didn't have a wide variety of fruits.   Service was definitely above average, main food was solid, and the fruit options was a little bit below average so I went with a 3 star rating since I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to return to this spot.",

    "text": "Every time I've gone to look up the best breakfast & lunch spots in Las Vegas, this place continues to top the list.  I've looked at the menu several times.  And I looked at the pictures several times.  Neither one seem to grab me.  So, I have always put off going here.  However, my Dad wanted to go eat breakfast and we wanted to try some place different.  I told him about this place and he said let's try it.  The phrase \"never judge a book by its cover\" came to mind.  We got there just in time (shortly after 8:00 am) to get a table without waiting.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  And just about everywhere now seems to have a shortage of people working.  This place does not.  They had quite a large staff waiting tables, delivering food, busing tables, and plenty of help in the kitchen.  The restaurant was immaculate.  I was very impressed.  My Dad ordered Two Eggs, Ham, Hash Browns, & a Pancake.  I had Two Eggs, Bacon, Home Fries, & Sourdough Toast.  Both of us enjoyed our meal very much.  The home fries were great, because they didn't put any onions or peppers in them.  it was just potatoes.  You can order them with onions & peppers and that is great that they give you that option, instead automatically including them.  Add in the coffee and orange juice and it was $27, which is extremely reasonable.  The only reason I did not give five stars is the bacon I got was VERY fatty and had no flavor whatsoever.  Whoever you order bacon from, I'd get a new brand or supplier.  Next time I will get the ham, because that looked delicious and my Dad said it was.  And I noticed they were even serving burgers at that time of day, so that is good to know, because I'm not a huge breakfast eater.  And they looked good too.  This place is about half way between work and my home, so I will definitely be back.  Highly recommended.",

We were lucky that we were able to get in without waiting at 8:45 on a Thursday morning but shortly after we were seated, there was a line of about 15 people. Nothing fancy here just great food and fast, friendly service.  Wife had the Mama's French Toast combo and it was great.  4 generous pieces of french toast, 3 eggs cooked perfectly with crisp, thick bacon.  I had the Chicken Fried Steak combo with home fries and 3 eggs.  Eggs were cooked exactly as I requested and the home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside but not greasy like so many tend to be.  The chicken fried steak was one of the best I've ever had.  Crisp breading (not too much), lean steak and plenty of good, thick sausage gravy.  Our server, Jose, was very attentive even though he also was serving a group of 12.  He kept our coffee cups full and kept checking with us to make sure we were happy.  Did I mention the coffee is really good? This is going to be our go-to breakfast place.  Can't wait to go back again and also try some lunch there as well.",

My daughter was a bit fussy and they brought some crackers as well as a drink to keep her calm while we waited. Keep in mind, we are a family of 5.  As for our order? California Omelette with Home Fries and Chicken Fried Steak with gravy, but you can choose what type of hash brown, bread and how your eggs are. We went with home style fries and regular hash brown as well as sourdough bread and a pancake. We substituted a pancake for a bread by the way, there was no additional cost. Eggs were over medium and scrambled.  For drinks, orange juice was delicious and soft drinks for everyone else. Cost wise, it is pretty inexpensive, but I think the plates can be shared as they are sizable proportions. My kids split a pancake and bacon as well as my wife cut her hash brown in half and gave it to them to share.  We will be returning every single time and I will say the greatest part was the exceptional service provided by the hosts and waiters. Don't fret about the wait or distance, this is one of the best places to eat breakfast while you're in Vegas!",

Nothing super special about any of the meals such as fanciness and what not but overall great staff all with a great attitude (especially for being a morning food place). I'm not a morning person so to see such genuine great attitudes to start your day is great. Nothing bad to say about the placd. Food and service both deserving of 5 stars.",

The cinnamon rolls are a must have! My husband has had the burgers and they are also very good.  Chicken fried steak was to die for with the sausage gravy being so darn good! I'm running out of adjectives for telling you how good this place is!! I'm a local and will take everyone who visits us here! Love love love!!!!",

Reminded me of when I am home in the Carolinas .  The waitress was nice and came back several times for refills and check on us which is rare in Las Vegas .  I love grits so I had to try theirs , cooked just right and a good sized bowl unlike most places if they even have them .  The chicken fried steaks was ok and the gravy was good , think , and chunky .  I will probably do the biscuits and gravy next time .  3 eggs and potatoes to fil you up .  My son had a large pancake which was fluffy and pretty good , but IHOP has an edge there .  I would recommend this place and will go again .",

The restaurant is very clean, staff are very nice and the owner is working with his staff and not bossing them around- nice change nowadays!  My husband got the pancakes, a cinnamon roll, a side of bacon and I got a half size of biscuits and gravy. No doubt their food is homemade and delicious but I feel like it is nothing too spectacular. Their pancakes are delicious and has a homey smell to it and their biscuits are nice and fluffy. Their gravy is homemade as well and you get little chunks of sausage and bacon in it.  If you do get a snack, beware of the cinnamon roll! It is extremely filling and delicious! We shared one and it was pretty large and I was so full after!   All in all, I'm sure we would come back as my husband loves American dining and I would just try something different.",

The menu contains nothing special (if anything, it is a rather ordinary, boring selection of very routine breakfast items).  The service, while not problematic, was not particularly great either.  Our meals were both just fine--eggs Florentine benedict for my partner, and a breakfast sandwich for me--but absolutely ordinary in every way.  The loudmouth who greets people when they walk in the door and seats them when a table is available could use a lesson or two (or three) in manners.  At least the rest of the staff was friendly enough.  Would I eat here again?  Yeah, I suppose so.   Would I be itching to eat here again with enthusiasm?  No, not at all.",

I mean, we were walking from the truck to the restaurant and the front doors fly open, the owner pops his head out, and with a jolly bellow calls \"Good Morning you three! Get in here, it Breakfast time. We've been waiting for ya!\" Like the most jovial and friendly Grandpa/Dad/Santa figure you'd meet! (Btw-he looks nothing like Santa...I'm just setting the scene, go with it)   He was just the first of many friendly faced staff members.  Everyone was totally on point with the Customer service.  The Manager stoped to talk to each table and was super personable and authentic with each, she lingered, but not too long.  A True art.    The food was good! We had Cornebeef Hash, the Short Stack, and a Veggie Omelet.  Portions are substantial but not out of control.  The flavor was solid, not really elevated at all, but truly solid! A great diner with AMAZING staff. go and support this place if breakfast is the craving!",

It had been a few years since I've eaten here. I'm not surprised they had to move to a offer location. Bcz this place was amazing the last time I was here.  The new location is really nice and as you might expect with something this good. There was a little bit of a wait. But it's well worth it.  The place is clean and the menu is excellent!  The coffee isn't the usual crappy coffee like you get elsewhere. It's really good.  We came here this morning to eat with my brother before heading home. He had not heard of this place.  The menu is a little overwhelming. The choices are great. My brother had corned beef hash. Mom had the wife had the standard eggs and bacon or sausage. Me???? I like to tryn people's chicken fried steak. Bcz it's always different everywhere you eat.  These guy get down. The gravy is honest to God sausage gravy. The steak didn't seem to be some frozen patty with gravy to hide the lack of quality.  The eggs were real eggs. Toast was buttery. I like my hash browns crispy. I got crispy. One of the guys even took a group picture of us. I think he may be he owner. Bcz I believe I seen him at the old location. This is one of those places when I come to Vegas that is going to be one of my regular stops.",

    "text": "I had several places in Vegas bookmarked from Yelp's Top 100 lists and Mr. Mamas was the first to be crossed off the list. They're in a strip mall with heavily tinted windows, giving the impression that no one is in. Once you're inside, you'll see how happenin' the place is. There was a 15-20 minute wait on Sunday morning at 10:30 am. It's worth it though, so tough it out by using the waiting time to pick what you want to order and see what others have ordered.  We got an all brunch spread with a cinnamon roll ($3.75), a pancake ($2.85), a side order of 2 sunny side up eggs ($3.00), a meat & cheese omelet with home fries and toast ($9.75), and coffee ($2.50). First up was the cinnamon roll - the size of a dinner plate. It's a must order. I knew the cinnamon roll would be filling so I only ordered one pancake, rather than a stack of two. It too was the size of a dinner plate and was oh so fluffy. The omelet comes with your choice of ham, sausage or bacon for meat and your choice from over six variety of cheeses (we ordered Monterey jack, but somehow got American cheese when the omelet came). BF thought the home fries were the circular ones in the Yelp photos, but they were cubed crisp seasoned potatoes. So so good! Two pieces of toast accompanies the omelet as well.  Service was fantastic. BF's coffee cup never went empty for long. They also helped us take a picture when noticing us taking pictures of the food. Mr. Mamas himself went the effort of taking a high level shot by standing on a chair to get a full shot of us at the table with all the food included.  We left full -- too full! -- and ready to take a lazy Sunday nap.",

Everyone was cheerful and engaging.  Mr.  Mama's understands what guest service is all about.   This visit (because I will be back) I went for the Greek Omlette with hash browns, wheat toast and coffee. This generous helping of a 4 egg omlette definitely gave me the energy to carry me through my day.   Stuffed with tomato,  garlic,  purple onion,  spinach and creamy feta cheese,  this omelet was delicious.  My hash browns were cooked just the way I like em, well done and crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  The only down fall was they were a little slow to refill the coffee but I will not deduct stars for this.  The 5 star service made up for it.",

They check on you frequently during your visit and the manager (or owner?) Rounds and asks if everything is okay. I honestly thought the food was just OK. I got chicken fried steak and it wasnt bad at all. I guess I was just expecting to be blown away (after seeing the reviews and lines out the door). I also got a cinnamon roll and I hated it. I didn't think it was fresh or delicious. Maybe I just got the wrong thing but I really didn't enjoy the food. I have to give this place four stars because they have five star service. They really do have great customer service, which in my book goes a long way.",

    "text": "We were vacationing in Vegas (on the strip) when a friend recommended their favorite off-strip restaurant. We decided to try Mr. Mama's not only based on their recommendation but also the many positive Yelp reviews.   I hade the breakfast burrito, husband had the corn beef and hash with a side salad, daughter #1 had a BLTA with chicken noodle soup, and daughter #2 had an a la carte pancake. All of us thought the food was good. Daughter #1 raved about the chicken noodle soup. The side salad that my husband had was huge, a generous portion for sure. The pancakes are also really big and perfectly cooked, but one was plenty for the eight year old.   The owner is incredibly personable and was the person taking names up front when we got there. He quoted a wait of about 30 minutes and we waited about 25 - decent as the place was pretty packed for a Friday at 11:00 am. He was chatting with everyone and you can tell he loves his customers. He really was all over the place overseeing everything and I think his involvement makes a difference in the success of the place. The service was great and the employees seemed to love their jobs - yet another difference maker.  One really lovely perk is that they offer you a to-go cup and that's awesome as we have an eight hour drive ahead of us so having an ice cold drink was just a nice offer.   Our entire meal was just over $44.00. After paying $75 (average) for meals on the strip that were subpar in most cases, this was a great deal.",

    "text": "Probably one of the best breakfast places I've been to.  In Vegas or anywhere...  Came Saturday, day before Easter around 10:30 am. Yes, there was a line outside.   Outside - fairly new building. Check out my photo from the parking lot.    Sign-in - the  Dude (I forget his name), said about a 45 minute wait.  I thought - well,  if Yelpers say it's 4.5 stars,  it's got to be worth the wait.  So wait we shall.  25 minutes later, my party already had our table.  Yay!  Atmosphere - I love the checkerboard floors that make it seem like you're in a diner, but with a truly open floor plan.  You see everyone.  There's no hiding inside Mr. Mama's, so anyone fooling around in Vegas will probably avoid this place.  Hahaha, and that's one of the reasons I love it.  Even with all the noise, it's all good.  It's exciting seeing what everyone else got, too.  Makes you more hungry.   Food - OMG!  I got the Mama's Stack which comes with 3 pancakes.  Everything on that plate was awesome.  My tween son had the Spanish omelette. I didn't try it, but what I did try was the french fries on his plate.  They're so cute cubed up that all that time i thought they were hash browns. And they tasted sooo good..   Service - very impressed.  Even though it was a packed house,  food came in out in 15 minutes tops. And not just us, seems everyone else too.  Our server, gal that looks like Selena Gomez, was very friendly and attentive.  She checked on us every 5 minutes.  Kat, the  manager, circled around checking on everyone.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever gotten that kind of attention from a breakfast joint anywhere.    My only complaint, which I shared with Kat - was the fact that they have only 2 restroom stalls, a men and a women.  Since this place looks like it's going to be or continue to be the next big thing in Vegas, we should have at least 2 stalls for each sex, in case one gets tied down.  And you know that happens...    Lastly, my only hope is that they do not grow too big.  Meaning they don't make too many locations.  Keep it original and stay as is.  Don't oversaturate the market.  Give me a reason to go to this one location for a while.",

I guess I'm used to super-flavorful sausage gravy and, while this was good, it didn't have the scrumptious sausage gravy taste and flavor I was looking forward to. Plus, the biscuits were almost more of a cornbread consistency rather than a fluffy biscuit. Again...not bad, but not as good as I hoped. The eggs were very good.   My husband had the breakfast burrito and had the same sentiment...good, but still lacked good strong flavors. My sister went there about a month ago and got an omelet and had nothing but good to say about it. I'll get that next time.   The coffee was very good. The service was outstanding...everyone was very attentive to us and very kind. It was very busy when we went, yet we still felt very welcome.",

Already got my attention on the way in by how personal he was Loved it!.. the service staff was on it....from coffee (even had vanilla creamer) to food recommendations. We both decided to go against our diet even though they offered all sorts of options. Chili cheese omelet for me and a chicken fried steak for her. Everything was sooooo good.

Anyway, our party had a breakfast burrito, 2 hamburgers and a chicken fried steak.  The comments on the food was the chicken fried steak was good and everything else was okay.  The owner meets and greets most and has to go home tired as I am not sure he stopped talking the whole time we were there.  The ambiance of the diner is non descript as all tables are in open space and I don't know what the lighthouse and other pictures have to do with restaurant name or logo or if it they are just simply unrelated. It seems like they do a good amount of business with regulars and church groups but our group will continue to try other places for lunch.",

But on this one particular visit, it was proven to me that this place is extraordinary.  My coworkers and I planned a very last minute get-together. We didn't know how many people would show and we needed a place to go dine. I suggested Mr. Mama's but fail to realize 1) it was a Sunday Morning 2) I didn't call ahead of time to attempt to make a reservation 3) we had children in the group. By the time we all showed up at the restaurant, we were a group of 10 guests. Unintentionally, I created a restaurant's worse nightmare.  But Mr. Mama shockingly pulled through. After being told it would be an hour wait. My group waited patiently outside. Within 30 minutes, we received a table. Within minutes of being seated, our orders were taken and food was served.  As concierge, my group and I, all knew what a difficult situation we put on the restaurant. But wow. Not only was the food excellent, the friendly service was still there.  Mr. Mama, you and your team are simply amazing!!!",

We talked up to Mr. Mama's on a Saturday morning and was immediately created by a gentleman who opened the door for us and guided us to our table. Everyone was friendly and cheerful making us feel right at home.   Service here is beyond 5 stars and the food is just as good. We took other Yelper's advise and got the Country Fried Steak. Good thing we shared because portions here are HUGE! We were told their gravy is made with three kinds of meat plus honey and asked if we wanted samples before we ordered. Our waitress Julie was thoughtful and detailed when it comes to checking up on us and making sure everything was perfect.   Leaving Mr. Mama's was no different than arriving. We said our goodbyes and the door was popped opened as we walked out. Service like this is hard to come by and makes for a memorable meal.",

We were both so happy we ended up choosing this place! We went for brunch around 10 am and the place was pretty full already, but no wait time. You could just tell everyone around us was having a great experience, whether they had been there a dozen times or were newbies like me and my friend. The wait staff and every employee working there was super friendly, our waitress, Lourdes, was super sweet and made us feel so comfy and at home. People are not kidding when they say on the other reviews that you feel at home, you honesty do. Lourdes was friendly and talkative, but also gave us plenty of time to order since she knew me and my friend were catching up from not seeing each other for a while. She or another waiter were always refilling our coffee cups, which I love since I guzzle down coffee. Their coffee specifically was delicious and so was my homemade biscuits and gravy!! This place you could tell really did make their gravy from scratch and their biscuits were fluffy and had a really great, almost a bit sweet flavor which I LOVED. My friend got eggs Benedict which looked super yummy and both of our hash browns were cooked to perfection! My total was $12 which you can't beat since I was full and happy so I made sure to leave a generous tip because Lourdes deserved it. I will definitely come to this place again and recommend it to anyone in the area!!!",

As we waited Mr. Mama himself came to the table to talk to us. He's a really nice guy from Detroit, loves sports! He told us about his favorite things on the menu. The chicken fried steak with the sausage gravy is one of his favorites. I can see why. That dish did not disappoint at all. Someone at our table got pancakes and they were the size of the plate, they were light and fluffy and just amazing. I come to Vegas every so often and I found a new breakfast spot. If you have the time and you want to get off the strip and have a great meal at a decent price mr. mama is the place to go.",

Everyone made us feel like we were with family and treated us like we'd been eating there for years. Their portions are huge! We ordered about the same we order at places like IHOP and had to take half of it to go. The quality of the food exceeded my expectations as well especially considering how cheap it was. If you're in Vegas and looking to eat some traditional breakfast, go straight here. Seriously, stop looking up other restaurants on yelp, come here.",

We had the Eggs Benedict and the French toast with hash browns and it was so good! The hash browns are delicious by the way and one of the best I've had. The place was clean which is also a plus.

The service here is excellent which is why I give it 4 stars but food was average 3 stars, not bad but not great. My biggest complaint is they have basically no where to sit when waiting for a table. You have to stand outside in the sun given the direction the restaurant faces. Some kind of seating outside would make it much more tolerable when waiting 30+ minutes. Most of the time if it's over 30 minutes we just go elsewhere. It's also a bit warm inside but they usually have lots of fans running which makes it more tolerable",

When we first walked in we were greeted by Shawn and he took our name down. He was so nice and polite and made the wait worth while. We were seated and greeted by our server almost instantly. The great service really is a huge part of the culture here and it shows in every aspect.  The food was delicious as well. My mom and I split the biscuits and sausage gravy with hash browns. The gravy was so good and I usually don't care for it. My only advice would be to get the hash browns well done if you like them crispy. We also shared 1 pancake on the side and the server was so sweet because she let us get the special pancake like the sign said with chocolate chips and strawberries.  Overall, the experience was great, the service was great, and the food was great.",

But I took bites of everyone else's and the quality, taste and freshness was outstanding!  Again, I cannot stress enough how AMAZING service was! The owner greeted us as we walked in, shook our hands and welcomed us. Every person that attended us was equally upbeat, friendly, smiling and just all around AWESOME!",

It was so delicious, I would recommend it. The hash brown was crispy and just right. Overall , great food and pleasing experience.",

The staff was amazing. Melissa was our hostess/waitress. She was very nice and friendly. She kept our water glasses filled as well as my coffee. The food was good and you get big portions. So big I had leftovers for breakfast this morning. The manager was nice and welcoming. She welcomed everyone as they came in the door. Steve( I hope that's his name) was also nice and made sure the guest were seated in a timely manner. The place was busy all day. Big groups were coming and going as we enjoyed our food. Thank goodness it was just the two of us as we were seated really fast. I will definitely be going back to Mr. Mamas in the near future!",

    "text": "This place has some of the most disarmingly polite service I've ever seen at a restaurant. Their attention to these small interpersonal details is commendable. The restaurant was also impeccably clean - our table was immaculately set, all of the condiments were wiped totally clean (even the syrup bottle and these can get a little gross and sticky and diners), and the condiments were in a caddy on the table with all of the labels facing forward.   For breakfast, I got the eggs florentine and added ham. I also got a side of hash browns and a single pancake (I was hungry). When it comes to hash browns and pancakes, I think they're hard to screw up but also hard to make shine and in both cases Mr. Mama's versions of these dishes were a cut above the rest. Both were very tasty and worth ordering again. The eggs florentine was probably the only area of opportunity for improvement. For the most part, the dish was tasty and plated well, but the spinach was really under-seasoned and there was enough of it that it made the entire dish taste a little bland.   My partner got the chicken fried stake and it was delicious. I stole a bite and then kept finding myself taking more and more because it tasted so good. Yum.    Ultimately, I would say that Mr. Mama's lives up to its yelp! rating and I would recommend eating here to anyone considering a locally owned off-strip breakfast option while in Vegas.",

Tired of the overpriced, crowded, and often underwhelming Vegas food options on The Strip (near the Flamingo), we sought out something different. After only one google search we chose Mr. Mamas based on its high reviews and we could not have made a better choice.  After a 25 minute Uber ride in traffic we arrived at Mr. Mamas and were sat immediately (however we did hear that they get quite busy so I guess Monday at 1pm was our lucky time). We both ordered the Chicken Fired Steak and Eggs. Everything was amazing and for about $10 per meal the $15 Uber ride basically paid for itself...since our other options were expensive buffets or pricey breakfast locations with insane waiting times. The gravy is even made in house! Delicious.  The staff were some of the nicest people we met the entire time. Multiple people greeted us, asked how our meal was, and had great conversation and service.  This was the perfect end to our trip and made our 8 hour delayed flight worth every hour. If you are looking for more \"affordable\" food with friendly staff and amazing breakfast/lunch then Mr. Mamas is the place to go.",

If you normally get a full-stack, get a short-stack... You've been warned!   Eggs Benny was quite tasty (tho the hollandaise could use more lemon)  The chicken fried steak is pretty darn good,  for not being made in Texas . But it was homemade-breaded in-house... So total kudos!   Hashbrowns seriously rock: crispy, flaky and tasty.   French toast was good, and if you do not very soft inside (the way my friend likes), then these are fabu!   The bacon was beautifully crisp and awesome... Sadly, none of us liked the sausage (kind limp and bland)   Finally... Customer service was 120% awesome!  Kat, one of the managers was super polite and helpful, and a genuinely lovely lady.  Lourdes, our server, was wonderfully attentive and accommodating.",

I LOVE breakfast foods. No, really... I truly LOVE breakfast foods soo much. Omelettes, eggs, french toast, sausage, and on and on and on..so I had this place bookmarked for a while.  We walked in this morning and were instantly greeted with a \"Happy 4th of July\" greeting from Mr Mama himself! Wow! Ok..that was cool! The place was busy but we were still seated right away and our friendly waitress went over the specials of the day. There were so many items I wanted to try from the get go, but I decided on a classic fave of mine - steak and eggs! My friend got the same thing, so than we decided to split an order of french toast just to try something else out.  Service here is incredible! The waitress and owner were so friendly and personable! They were attentive without being intrusive. The service here was simply sheer perfection on this day!  ...and the food! Wow! Everything was cooked so fresh and tasted fantastic! I prefer my steaks medium rare and often time run into places that will overcook it. Not Mr Mama's! This steak was cooked to perfection and was seasoned beautifully! Even the hash browns were cooked just right! So frickin' tasty!  It is a 100% guarantee that I will be back here, and quite often, to try different menu items! The prices here are very fair and reasonable, but the food, and especially the service, are incredible!   Woohoo! As good as it gets!  5 stars!",

I wasn't sold on the breading completely, but the steak inside was tender and moist. Great flavors. Comes with sausage gravy, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but it did the job. I got the hash browns on the side EXTRA CRISPY, and they gave me what I wanted. SO FREAKING GOOOD.   Buttermilk pancakes- 4 stars. Chewy, yummy, good stuff.   Eggs benedict- 4 stars. It's all in the hollandaise sauce. I've had better, but I'm super picky about my sauces so don't quote me. Go eat here and judge for yourself.   Overall, this is a great place for brekkie.",

We had Lourdes as our waitress and while she was visiting with us the others stepped up and delivered our meals without hesitation.  I observed this over and over throughout the meal. Job well done to this exceptional business. Detroit's loss is Las Vegas' gain. We'll be back!",

Friendly (but not overly so) employees from start to finish. They were fun to talk to and seemed to really enjoy their jobs.   + Best hash browns I've ever had in my life. They look so normal and unassuming but once you take a bite, it's like a little piece of crispy potato heaven.  + Great prices for what you get.  + You can substitute toast for 1 pancake at no extra charge! The pancake is also delicious and pretty large as well. I couldn't finish mine.  + As long as you walk in the door before closing (2pm on weekdays, 3pm on weekends), they will seat and serve you!  - The steak was too salty. It was tender though, so maybe it was just seasoned with a heavy-handed chef this time.   - I called ahead of time to make sure we were ok to come in pretty close to closing time. Whoever answered the phone did not sound friendly but maybe that's just me.  So far, I've only had the Cali omelet, steak and eggs, and pancakes, all of which were bomb. Even the coffee is pretty tasty for a drip variety! It's always good to leave a restaurant feeling jubilant thanks to delicious food and impeccable service. It was so good that the small negative notes don't even matter to me. Can't wait to go back soon!",

Stopped by here for an early lunch with the hubs and was greeted at the door by 2 staff members.  Very friendly and welcoming.  We were given a choice of where we would like to sit and asked what we wanted to drink.  Moments later our waitress returned with our drinks and took our order with her phone.  Really cook concept!  I had an omelet that I asked to be converted into a scramble.  It was served with a choice of potato and toast.  The meal was huge and tasted great.  My scramble came with a half of an avocado!  Right on Mr. Mama!  This restaurant is in a strip mall not far from the 215.  Parking was a breeze and the food came out in good time.  One thing is for sure...we will be back!",

Our server was Lourdes and she was absolutely amazing! Checking in on us making us feel welcome and giving out awesome recommendations. I got the Jenna Wrap and Lourdes said to add bacon with it and it was spot on. My husband had the country fried steak(everytime we try a new breakfast place he orders it and rates the place on well his dish is). He finished it and was impressed by the portion and deliciousness. Definitely willing to make the drive out here again just to eat.",

He is the nicest guy and always wants to make sure that everyone is having a great meal. The food is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Chili Cheese Omelet. I know it sounds strange, but its delicious. Great home style food!!! Keep it up Mr. Mamas!!!!",

Coffee served in small mugs, which was Ok only so long as the refills came frequently, and for the most part they did. French toast OK (when I drenched it in syrup), and the bacon was good. Home fries a little disappointing, pretty much square french fries--I should have upgraded with the peppers and onions add-on. Mushroom omelet also OK, but the mushroom pieces were not as big and plentiful as we've seen elsewhere. Absolutely nothing wrong, but no reason for me to return (except maybe to try a hamburger).",

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, gave me a sample of the gravy to try. So I got a mama's stack with eggs and sausage and my wife got eggs & turkey bacon with a single pancake.  First off, I must give this disclaimer, the pancakes are HUGE! Don't make the mistake I made and underrate them like I did. I could've easily filled up off a short stack. Not only are they big but they're fluffy as tasty. The eggs and sausage was great as well. Coffee tasted amazing! The waitress even gave us cups to go.

We barely had time to start drinking our coffee before all three of us at the table had our food. We stayed until closing and Ro made us feel welcome, saying don't worry about hurrying out. She even gave us tall to-go cups so we could take our coffee on the road. Would absolutely recommend for either morning or afternoon breakfast!",

It didn't taste 4.5 stars, I'm not a better man, my food understanding is still the same. I waited 10 mins. I liked the decor. Like this just seemed like a perfectly normal ass restaurant. WTF I am actually confused? What did y'all get? Was I supposed to get the pancakes?  I'm sorry if this is the pride of y'all town and shit but I just didn't care for this place. If I'm being honest I'll probably come back here, bc I'd forget I came here. Get back at me, what did I do wrong.  Update: Nick P. Thanks for taking the time to answer my question. That's cool that y'all are like a special place for friends and family. Y'all do make it seem like a comfortable ass place.

When we were walking up to the door an employee open the door welcoming us in and directing us straight to a table. It was busy so I was happy to be seated right away. Their menu has a large selection but we wanted a light breakfast so we ordered as soon as we were waited on. The veggie omelette with hash brown was delicious; not greasy. The half order of biscuit and gravy was good. I like for the biscuit to be fluffier than dense but the gravy with sausage was savory. As we finished our meal the owner Mr. Mama introduced himself and asked about our meals. I mentioned that it was a great birthday breakfast and he offered me a cinnamon roll. I declined because we were already full but he insisted and had it packed to go. It was delectable!!! Thank you so much for my gift and hospitality!!!! As for pricing, it was very reasonable. I would highly recommend; and I will be back on my next visit to Vegas.",

    "text": "I am THRILLED to be writing this review. This place is more than a mom & pops place...it's the place you can go for ANY & every event in your life.   For me...well I just came with my fiance for Saturday brunch. It's definitely located in a plaza where you would easily miss it if you weren't using SIRI to find it (as I've driven past this place several times myself). When you get there, you're more than likely going to see people gathered outside & even sitting inside waiting for a seat in their restaurant. WORRY NOT. The wait may be 20-25 minutes...but you'll enjoy EVERY minute of whatever you order off that menu.   Suffer now & enjoy your meal like a champion. Haha!   We took a moment during the wait to sneak a peak at the menu and decide what we wanted...and this is what we came up with:   1. Mama's Breakfast Burrito  * skipped the meat...but added Pico De Gallo*  THEY PUT IN AN ENTIRE AVOCADO IN THIS. I couldn't believe it -- that made this burrito 100% worth it & more. I usually don't eat burritos for breakfast, but I would damn sure well do it every day if it from this place.   2. French Toast (2)  So like, I don't know why I thought 1 order of French toast wouldn't be enough & decided to order 2. Well, I guess I overestimated...and then ate half of this item in a few minutes worth. #GobbleGobble The French toast has a little kick of cinnamon to it & you put syrup & run it through some of the powdered sugar on the plate -- and you've got yourselves a mighty good sweet tooth satisfied.   3. Veggie Omelet  Now this ones for the folks that can't go without eggs in the morning. Mr Mamas has a TON of options of what you can possibly do with eggs...so don't feel limited. Also, their house fries are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> - so don't miss out on trying those.   In terms of the service, it was EXCELLENT. We had people who called my fiance by name to ask how the food was, asked to take pictures if we wanted to, and made sure our drinks were never left empty. They make customer service at other places look mediocre!   To say we will be back is an understatement - we will be back...over & over & over again.",

The Yelp reviews averaged 4.5 stars so I gave it a try and Yelpers didn't steer me wrong.  Customer service was above par from the get go. As we were walking up to the door, the host (and I think manager) opened the door for us and gave us a warm greeting. He told us to sit wherever we wanted. It didn't take long for someone to come over with water and offer any check to see if we wanted any other drinks. We also didn't wait very long for our food to be served to us.   In all honesty, the food wasn't spectacular. The pancakes, although they were generously sized, were kind of dry so I had to drench them in syrup. The eggs and everything else were standard but what I think made the experience so great was the fantastic customer service. Not bad Mr. Mamas, not bad.",

    "text": "What an incredibly friendly place! We were in Vegas visiting and found this place through yelp (thank you yelpers!) and the reviews were spot on. The staff is always checking in on you, not just once like in 98% of restaurants, but multiple times (not in annoying way) to ensure your coffee cup is always full and available for any questions or requests.   I'm an observer and love to people watch and let me tell you, I can't remember the last time I witnessed such courtesy and team work between staff members. They communicated well with each other and just seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. Loved that!  The atmosphere is very friendly and the food was good. The owner (at least that's who I think it was) made his way around tables chit-chatting with customers. He seemed genuine.  All in all, I enjoyed the food and my time there",

We ordered a western omelet, strawberry French toast, half biscuits and gravy, and scrambled with sausage and hash browns. There were no complaints and everyone enjoyed their breakfast.  I was a little confused by the sweet biscuits for my sausage gravy? Never had anything like that. Texture and everything about the biscuits were good but sweetness just didn't do it for me.  Would we go back?  Definitely. Oh, and when we were leaving at 10:30am, the line was out the door!",

It wasn't mediocre either. Something about their gravy made the flavor with the fried chicken perfect to the pallet. My food was so good when my husband wanted to try it, he wanted more! (DANG! Eat your own food!)    Service was quick and we didn't have to wait to be seated. May I add that all the condiments are already on the table so you don't have to ask the server for anything maybe except for a refill on your drink. Anyway, I can understand why this place is loved by so many. The staff is so awesome and friendly, I feel like I'm eating a meal at home. I will always come back to this place. THANKS MR. MAMAS!",

The gravy is homemade sausage, bacon with a hint of maple syrup. I killed it.  The atmosphere is great and the wait staff is excellent. I love trying out the mom and pops restaurants because you can actually get that little extra slice of love we are all looking for. If you are looking for a nice place to eat I would suggest coming to Mr. Mamas you won't be sorry.",

They even gave us a complimentary cinnamon roll to apologize for the long wait. (I didn't even think it was long. Seriously it wasn't) but can't refuse a few cinnamon roll.  Got the eggs benedicts florintine with their house fries and the Mamas burrito. Both were delicious.  Then the end came and the price was even better!  Come check this place out for sure!",

Came here with my hubs and boys for breakfast before heading back home.  The boys split a small stack with eggs and ham.  The pancakes are HUGE, ham steak very tasty (8 yo ate the whole thing minus my taste) and eggs enough for my 6 and 8 yo.  The hubs had the four egg omelet with cheese and ham.  Big and filling.  I had the French Toast, eggs and bacon.  The French Toast was really good topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar.  Over easy eggs cooked perfect and delicious, crispy bacon.  The drinks were constantly topped off.  I saw their chicken fried steak and had already decided that would be at my table our next stop here.  I must say, the staff here is amazing.  Our server, Kathy, was very sweet and attentive.  They have their business down pat with an abundance of employees hustling to get the food out quick and hot.  Plates removed promptly and everyone very friendly.  The gentleman taking names at the front appeared to be Mr. Mama himself.  LOL Very nice and friendly to all.  Thank you for a delicious breakfast to end our fun stay in Sin City.  We will definitely see you again!",

The food was fresh and cooked exactly the way we ordered it! It came quick and was still hot. The pancakes are delicious and are as big as the plates they are served on. Coffee was great and the sausage tastes homemade. My friend dropped her credit card on the floor and the owner. Brought it out to the car!  I love this place and will be going back for lunch!!",

Every single time I have been there, the owner walks around and asks how everything is. He seems like such a nice guy! This adds a nice touch to the already great place! I like the new location, it is way bigger! Since this place is always busy, that's important because no one likes to wait, especially for breakfast.  So far I have tried the french toast, eggs and bacon. Delicious! The french toast is absolutely perfect. I took my nephew when he was in town visiting and he had the pancakes. They were so big! He said they were yummy and he wants to go back during his next visit.  This is a great place for locals and tourists. It's really close to the strip and affordable, so if you have a rental car, you should go! Even if you have to take a taxi, I would still recommend going. You will probably still pay less with the taxi fair than if you had breakfast in your hotel.",

The food arrived quickly, hot & huge portions. The price was affordable. Later, I found out the man who greeted us at the door is the owner.

The gravy has sausage, bacon and maple syrup!!! Hubby had Soup and Salad with a cup of Beef Vegetable soup that tasted just like the one make at home.

Even though we waited exactly 40 min, she offered us a free cinnamon roll for our patience. They even adjusted the feet on our table before we were seated because it was wobbly. The owner (I'm guessing he's the owner) offered to take our picture and stood on a chair to make sure he has a good angle. These little details really made the experience aside from the delicious food. My husband and I shared a rib eye steak and eggs and a Spanish omelette. I would come back for the steak alone! Everyone in our party was pleased with the food and impressed with the service. Thanks for the recommendation, Yelp.",

My buddy and I yelped and found this place with 4.5 stars and over 2600 reviews so figured we had to give it a shot.   The staff was very friendly and paid attention to our order and needs.  IE I ordered a Diet Pepsi with lemon and when the waitress brought a refill she included a lemon with out me asking.  Most restaurants I need to remind or ask for another lemon.  They checked on us regularly to make sure everything was ok.   The food was good,  I had strawberry French toast and my buddy a breakfast burrito.  The food tasted great and fresh.  For the price I wish the portions were a little bigger and for the breakfast burrito it would of been nice to grill it or make it stand out some how from a standard breakfast burrito.   Once I relocate to Vegas I would definitely repeat and bring guests with me to eat here.",

I have to wonder if reviewers have the right place.  I had 2 eggs and ham, hash browns and toast. Wifey had the chili. We both had coffee. My eggs were cooked well. The hash browns were crispy on the outside (nice) but mushy and overcooked on the inside (yuk). Toast is, well, toast; nothing special. The ham was what you would expect, a canned ham warmed on the grill.  My wife's chili was just okay. She thought it tasted a bit like canned ingredients.  Coffee was okay. Reminded both of us of McD's.  The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special at all. Very minimal effort went into creating this space. I was expecting much better.  Service was quick and friendly, but no where near the level you read in most of the reviews.

I got their chili cheese omelette with their house made chili, and it was perfect! Their home fries are very tasty as well. The biscuits and gravy are some of the best I've ever had. Their gravy is a little thick, but it's so flavorful. They use bacon and sausage, and a little maple syrup. They even let us sample the gravy before we ordered.

It's sad, I must say, that this level of customer service and human interaction are not the norm. Before I could even ENTER the establishment, I was greeted at the door by Kat (I hope I got that right - in hindsight she deserved to be remembered) with a tremendous smile and a heart-felt greeting. I was promptly seated. My server came over in very short time (Roneisha, I believe), who very kind, professional, and spoke to me directly (eye contact carries weight). Food was delicious (nothing fancy - oatmeal and two hard-scrambled eggs), but the SERVICE...almost finished with my meal (I am not at all opposed to dining alone), a gentleman approached and asked about the experience so far. Mr. Mama himself. So kind, so engaging, along with the staff (others asked about my experience, as well, and if they could do anything more). I will definitely be returning. I dont typically write these, but this was absolutely worthy of the effort. Even in leaving, well-wishes and confirmation of a positive experience. Breakfast was affordable, but the human decency, the warm interactions, they genuine concern, the KINDNESS: priceless, and hard to find. Here's a place. If there WAS a downside, its that Mr. Mama is a Michigan man (Go Bucks!), but I cant find it in my heart to hold that against him. Wonderful experience in a time where my soul benefitted from that visit tremendously.",

Hash browns were better than most places - brown and crispy outside and soft but not over cooked inside. Coffee was decent and the vanilla creamer raised the flavor level. Prices are very good and servings are more than adequate.  The dining room is spacious and would accommodate a small group breakfast easily.  I'll return soon and try the pancakes-they look delicious.   I returned to try the pancakes. They did not disappoint-they were large, very light, fluffy, tasty and a beautiful golden brown.

I had the greek omelet and my friend had a breakfast plate with pancakes (tasted those and they were traditional and fluffy!).. The home fries were good, and I recommend adding the peppers and onions, of course. The staff was very friendly and on point. We even had a few different employees check on us throughout breakfast. Coffee and water refills were always available when we needed them. It's a large restaurant with many tables to accommodate how busy they are. The cinnamon rolls looked awesome!! We didn't notice those until we saw another table get them, next time :) Prices are reasonable as well.",

They have plenty of seating in this restaurant. It's a very open concept with the tables and chairs. The staff was very friendly; they were always smiling!  We got seated and waters were brought out immediately. Our waittresss gave us time to look at the menu. She went through and gave her recommendations as well.  I ordered the eggs benedict with canadian bacon and my friend ordered 2 pancakes, 2 Eggs with country fried potatoes.   Our orders came out quickly. We were ready to eat so very happy about the service at Mr. Mamas. I requested extra crispy hashbrowns and they got it perfectly. The eggs benedicts were classically made; the hollandaise sauce was perfect. The portions were huge as well.   My friend enjoyed his meal and I had to help him finish because of how big the portions were. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery YUM!   And of course, the country fried potatoes, my goodness that was a pandemonium of flavors; my taste buds were having a party! Our waitress was so friendly and made sure she didn't just grab plates!! She asked before grabbing anything.   I gave this place a five because they stayed True to what they offered. This place is meant to be classic breakfast food and they do it well!",

I like a good breakfast and Mr. Mamas does it right. I've never had corned beef hash this good. The restaurant is clean and well organized, the wait staff is as courteous and professional as I've seen, and the owner is a wonderful character with a huge heart for his customers. It can get very crowded with a substantial wait as the morning progresses, as it is extremely popular. There's a reason for that, of course, it's a great place to eat with good food and good prices. I highly recommend.",

    "text": "This place has gotten incredibly popular since the last time I went. So, expect a wait time. However, one thing I really admired was that the hostess was fantastic at calling people's names. She was very thorough. She would loudly repeat the guest's name multiple times inside the restaurant and then proceed outside doing the same thing. There was no way you would miss hearing your name.   Anyways, Mr Mamas definitely lives up to their standard of making people feel like they're at home. Every employee that we encountered was friendly. Our server was very attentive and made sure our coffees, waters, and soda never reached halfway.    The food was delicious and exceptionally large portions. You are definitely getting your money's worth. I ordered the country fried steak, which had a great steak to gravy ratio. The steak wasn't drenched in gravy, but it also wasn't significantly lacking some. I would definitely put this place as one of my top places to get a country fried steak considering that is the main dish I order at any other breakfast spot.",

Mr. Mama's is way better than the over priced buffets. Everything here is delicious. Everything is cooked fresh unlike the buffets. For $10 or $15 you can get a full plate, you'll leaved as stuffed as you would at a buffet. If I am ever again in vegas I'll make sure I come back here.",

There wasn't a wait at the time, but by the time we were leaving at around 9:30am, there was much more people waiting outside. I appreciate how the employees opened the door for us as we walked in. I noticed that they tried to do that for every customer, which is a nice gesture. There are not any outlandish dishes here, everything is pretty simple breakfast/brunch food. I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs and my friend ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. We also had to try their cinnamon roll, which is one of the things that this restaurant is known for. Our food came out so fast, I think it took us longer to order than to wait for our food. Lol. I LOVED my corn beef hash and eggs, my favorite part about it was the hash browns, which I always order extra crispy. Their cinnamon roll is alright - it's soft and not too sweet, but nothing beats Cinnabon cinnamon rolls to me. Haha. Overall, their service is impressive - they have a lot of employees working so there is always someone to help us.",

The owner, Mr. Nick, was extremely hands on and helpful. He answered all of our questions and gave suggestions. I was even escorted to the kitchen by Mr. Nick after I asked why he didn't have chicken and waffles. Turns out waffle stations take up a lot of space and have federal regulations that this restaurant wasn't set up for (for now). This place is almost a must have when in Vegas!!!! Go try it.",

Watching the young adults that clean the tables and sweep the floors after EVERY visitor was more impressive!  Watching each server seat their table, rearrange the table to have the napkins/salt/pepper/condiments opposite of you was super impressive!  Leaving and having someone run to open the door for you impressed me to tell them how fantastic they were as I left!  Ordering was difficult as everything looks good!  I went with the Cali Omelette which was a four egg, yes four, with sausage, pico, two different cheeses, sour cream, and avocado slices!  Amazing!  The Chicken Fried Steak was super tender with a nice breading, three eggs cooked to order, and breakfast potatoes that weren't your typical potatoes!  Both dishes came with delicious sourdough toast.....a Vegas staple!  The food speaks for itself here, but the protocols that are in place and followed by everyone is simply outstanding!!  I hope they continue to knock it out of the park as they're so deserving of their incredible ratings!",

Mr.Mamas hooked me up with some delicious eggs benedict that will ensure that dish a regular spot in my breakfast rotation.   I also had the hash browns and biscuits & Gravy. The hash browns were cooked to crispy perfection. The gravy was a little sweet for my taste but when I ordered they made it a point to say they use maple syrup in it.   Mr. Mama greets you at the door with a smile & the entire staff follows his lead by being attentive and friendly. Anytime I'm in Vegas this will be my \"go to\" breakfast spot.",

Our table was near the kitchen, and the manager (a nice lady named Kat or Cat) came over, introduced herself, told us our server would be out promptly, and took our drink order.  I had the southern eggs benedict (mini chicken fried steak patties atop English muffins, with the specialty gravy), and the hash browns.  The eggs Benedict dish was ok. It was pretty standard.  The hash browns were light and crispy, without being greasy, just how I love them!  Their gravy is made with bits of sausage, bacon, and a little maple syrup, so there's a little bit of sweetness in there.  Our waitress was a nice lady named Claudia, and she was helpful, nice, and quick with service.  In the background, the manager Kat kept everyone on track and also pitched in as needed, a sign of a great manager.  The restaurant was clean and orderly, despite it being a busy and crowded weekend morning. The tables were bussed quickly, and there appeared to be a very smooth flow - great to see that at an establishment!  I'm giving this place 4 stars, because while the service and restaurant atmosphere was a shining 5, the food itself is only a 4.  Skip the crowded buffets of the Strip for a quieter and more comforting breakfast of Mr Mamas!",

My wife order the corn beef hash and it was salty, taste like from a can because it is from the can no finesse in the presentation. My friend order the chicken fried  steak and that was a disappointment the breading was so thick half the weight is flour and needs more taste.   I think this place has great potential the service is in tune but the food needs some tweaking in taste, layer of flavor. I believe most people don't want big portion for the sake of creating value, they want quality food, scratch cooking with great service and atmosphere.",

The owner Nick will open the door and greet you when you walk up to the restaurant. Then he will get you seated right away ... and if the place is busy he will let you know how long your wait will be, offer you a chair, and be extra attentive to you. While he is doing this, he is aware of everything that is going on in his restaurant, from the guests' needs to the activities of his staff.  This place is full of good energy!  Claudia was our great waitress. She served us water and coffee, then took our orders, and came back with our hot food not too long after. She, the other staff members, the owner, and even the hostess made their rounds through out the restaurant and stopped by our table often enough to clear empty plates and to make sure that our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty.   We didn't order anything extraordinary but what we did order was excellent:  Pancakes: really really good.  Ham steak: perfect portion perfectly cooked.  Hash browns: golden crispy.  Biscuit gravy: very good. Gravy had bits of sausage and bacon in it.  Wedge salad: they added sliced onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers to it. This added to the presentation. I loved it, but husband would ask for those on the side next time.  Home fries: truly the best! Bacon: perfectly not overly cooked crispy.  Cinnamon rolls: daughter got a free one for her birthday. I am not big on sweets, but this is really really good.  Coffee: good Eggs: expectedly prepared as ordered.   I asked for a side order of fresh jalapenos for my sunny side up eggs and they came out nicely diced.   I liked this restaurant the moment I walked in. It is spacious and clean and generates good energy. All the staff is aware of all the going-ons in the restaurant, as well as being super politely friendly. I will definitely come here again the next time I come to to Vegas.   The only minor minus is although they have separate restrooms, their restrooms have only one stall.",

    "text": "I saw all the 5 and 4 stars for this place so was pretty excited about trying it. Came in with a group of 4 on a Tuesday about 1140am. Appeared to be about 4-6 groups waiting. Walked in and asked for a seating time. Was told that it would be at least thirty minutes. Place isn't big but from the front counter you can see the entire eating area. There were at least 6 tables that I counted that were empty or needed busing. I asked why the wait was so long with so many empty tables. The answer I got was that there were many groups ahead. I told the hostess I understood that but why were there so many tables open or just in need of busing? I then asked what the bus time was on each table. The answer I got was that there were groups ahead of me. Again, I stated that I understood that but that if they bused the tables and seated at the open tables there wouldn't be a need of a thirty minute wait time. This was met with the hostess again telling me that there were people ahead of me. So I asked do you mean there are more groups then I can see waiting? The reply was we are busy.   I'm sorry but there was no excuse I could see that these tables couldn't be cleared and groups seated in a much shorter time than thirty minutes. I'll take my money elsewhere.",

There was a man, perhaps the owner or manager, who was walking around greeting each table and making sure everything was good. He chat with a few of the tables. About the food, I got a Jenna wrap which is a tortilla wrapped around hard-cooked eggs, avocado, cilantro, jalapenos, sour cream, and salsa. It wasn't anything special at all, but it was enough to satisfy my hunger. I also ordered a pancake and that made me very happy.",

    "text": "Great breakfast place. We went on a mini vacation with the kiddos and we stumbled on Mr. Mama's through Yelp. The food is delicious with large portions. My son and I shared a Mamas Stack, and we had food left over. The customer service was superb. Kat, the manager, came over and personally introduced herself and made excellent menu recommendations. My 9 year old son was so impressed he leaned over and whispered, \"Mom they have great customer service.\" I highly recommend. We will be back on our next Las Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Couldn't decide between 3 and 4 stars.  There will be a wait but that is ok it is a smaller place. Food was ok, gravy was great,  hasbrowns so good. Now the biscuits were not southern like i had hoped they were buttery but just small. One party's chili omelet was not eaten after a few bites the chili was sweetish tasting. Our server tried but she kept forgetting it was all little things no water refill, had to catch her for the check, no followup i know they were busy. So i went with the 3 stars mainly because of my view of the haphazard order management. I sat there watching while orders filled the small order window and the orders just sat waitresses would go over look at all the dishes and walk away this happened again and again. I watched a stack of 3 pancakes sit for a good 15 minutes then they were pulled and it looked like they became a stack of 2. If those were my pancakes i would have sent them back but they werent mine. Maybe the kitchen and wait staff just need some bonding time. Next time i am in vegas i would give them another shot.",

I ordered the mommas French toast with ham and eggs and French toast and it was amazing! This is probably the best French toast I have ever had in my life. We were a party of 7 and that can be overwhelming in a full house as every seat was taken and people waiting. Our service was exceptional, I could hear the ladies game plan their day and how they will tend to customers. I had someone open the door for us as we were approaching from the staff. I cant say anything bad about this. Also, servings are big so come with an appetite.",

Jasmine was our waitress and she was awesome along with the rest of the wait staff. I was checked on by at least 3 different servers to see how we were doing and in my book, that's being amazingly attentive to their guests. My son ordered the breakfast sandwich and I had the steak and eggs. Ribeye is a little thinner than what I expected so I'll make sure to get it rare instead of medium rare, was more on the medium well side but that's probably because of thinness of the steak. Still doesn't take away that this place had great food and  A+++++ service. Will be back for brunch.",

Searching for a good breakfast place Mr. Mamas came up with high reviews and was real close to where I was renting my bike. As soon as we parked the bike and started heading for the entrance, the doors opened up and we were welcomed in and immediately seated. Everyone was very friendly and engaging, obviously knowing we were heading for a ride (Harley gear gave us away) we talked quite a bit about our upcoming adventure with (I assume) the owner. We truly felt like we were part of the family  I ordered Mamas Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs (my favorite breakfast) and my wife had Eggs Benedict.  The Chicken Fried Steak was one of the best I ever had, and the home made gravy was excellent.  My wife too was thoroughly impressed with her breakfast as well.    This was a perfect start to our day!!  We liked them so much we cam back the next morning before returning our motorcycle to the rental place.  Next time we're in Vegas, we plan on going back.",

We found this place on yelp and gave it a shot. While it was crowded, we waited less then 15 min to seated. The food was delicious and just what we were looking for. I ordered the cheese and egg sandwich and it was very good, my boyfriend and friends ordered other plates like the breakfast burrito and chicken and all of us were satisfied with our food. The staff was incredibly friendly and checked in on us often to make sure we were good with food and drinks. The icing on the cake was the price, much cheaper then what we would have gotten on the strip. Would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas.",

I went with family and everyone enjoyed their meal. I recommend the Spanish omelet (I added mushrooms) but the pancakes looked good as well.   The only drawback for me was the fact that I asked for dry toast and got it with light butter. To nitpick a bit more I also didn't like the idea of the waitress taking orders with a phone. I understand she doesn't handle the actual food but paper and pencil seem more sanitary to me. Minor complaints on an otherwise enjoyable experience.",

The gravy  with sausage chunks and you can taste the maple syrup in it.  Outstanding!  Reasonably priced, good service.  I had to call the manager over and compliment him on the dish.  Definitely my go to spot when in Vegas.",

Food was good but not the \"best I have ever eaten\".  The thing that turned us off and we won't be back is the grilling it felt like we got from the wait person and apparently the owner.  Before our order was taken the waitress wanted to know if we had been there before, how we found out about them, had we been to the previous location.  When I mentioned we learned about them from Yelp she went on to say they were previously the # 1 breakfast in Vegas but since they moved they had to start over and build up their Yelp account.  Food was fast and good.  Now here comes the owner I guess making the rounds asking the same questions and telling every table they used to be  the # 1 breakfast in Vegas and 3 in the country or something (by now I was shutting it off) but now they have to start over.  You know 1st of all the meal was good, not the best I've ever eaten and I don't need to feel like my meal is dependent upon writing a review for various sites.  LIke 'em , love 'em if you will I won't be back.",

It was kind of busy, but we went on a Sunday morning and the guy who checked us in said, \"its the Lord's day, that's why we're busy.\" That being said, it was only about a 15 minute wait. Classic diner feel down to the black and white checkered floor. The service from start to finish was excellent, very friendly, very nice. We ordered a variety of things and I was encouraged to get the chicken fried steak- which I just thought was good not great. Both my daughter and I ordered over medium eggs, neither one of which were over medium (If I wanted over easy I would have ordered over easy, but that's a tough call for many restaurants). Hash browns were very tasty and the pancakes were to die for! French toast was also good, sausage was good. As you can see we ate a ton of food. If you order the chicken fried steak you need to be starving because it's a BIG piece of meat. Overall, the experience was very nice and I'd go back.",

He always said thank you to customers for coming in and that he will see them next time. You don't get that kind of friendliness from owners now a days!   PANCAKES!!! The pancakes here are huge. A stack of 3 is big enough to share among 2 or 3 people if everyone gets something else but still wants a taste. The pancakes are fluffy and never burnt or chewy.   The first time I came here, the service I received was amazing. My coffee cup was always refilled and the girl working was friendly and always smiling. She checked up on us quiet often. My bf ordered the steak and eggs and the steak was very very thin. It was filling, but he mentioned that he wouldn't order steak and eggs from here again as there are other better and cheaper options on the strip. I ordered one pancake to share between the 2 of us, hash browns, 2 eggs, wheat toast and sausage. The sausage here are sausage patties so don't expect the regular sausage links. I prefer links so I didn't order the sausage the second time around.   If you like hash browns... you MUST order it here! They are SUPER crispy. They list potatoes on the menu but potatoes = hash browns here, unlike other places where potatoes mean fried potato chunks.   My sister ordered the chicken fried steak which came with 3 eggs, gravy, choice of toast and hash browns. It was huge. When we ordered this, our server asked us if we tried their gravy before and proceeded to list off a bunch of ingredients. Definitely not your traditional gravy. It was quite thick and very chunky. I did not like it but my sister did.   If I'm starving and want a good, quick breakfast, I'll head on over to Mr. Mamas!",

The inside is decorated with a checkerboard pattern tile floor with plain black chairs and tables, the place was immaculately clean.  We were instantly greeted and seated.  The service we received from start to finish was friendly and efficient.  We ordered: -French Toast with Bacon ($7.75) - Comes with two slices of French toast, the French toast was tasty and wasn't overly soggy either which I appreciate.  The server asked if I wanted my bacon crispy or soggy, I love that they ask you this and give you the option!  I opted for crispy and it was delicious.  -Two Eggs and Toast with Sausage Patties ($6.95) - I'm still impressed with how cheap this dish was!  You can pick between bacon, sausage patties, or ham.  My friend opted for the sausage patties.  You also get a choice of toast and hash browns/home fries.  I was able to steal some home fries off my friend's plate and honestly thought it was just okay, didn't eat anything else of theirs. -Cinnamon Roll (forgot the price!) - Either my friend and I are dummies for not being able to find this on their menu or it wasn't listed on their menu.  We asked our server about it and she put the order in for us no problem.  Man this beats cinnabon over the head.  Warm, fluffy, sweet, and delicious nothing more I could ask for.      I'm a little sad that Mr. Mamas isn't closer to me, if I'm ever in that area of town I'll definitely grab breakfast here!",

    "text": "The breakfast from Mr. Mamma's was probably the highlight of my stay in Vegas! The not so short drive from the strip and 15 minute wait when we got there were absolutely worth it! Never before had I had potatoes that were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. Revolutionary. My friend and I both had the Spanish omelette and french toast after seeing the many tempting pictures on Yelp. Both amazing! And so satisfying! My friend was raving about her juice, I had coffee. My cup, by the way, was never empty thanks to our server who was sweet and super attentive. We practically rolled out of our seats when we were through everything. That was probably enough to keep us going until dinner!  Thanks Mr. Mamma's, we will be coming back every time we're in Vegas!",

The food was as expected: eggs, pancakes, french toast, sandwiches, etc.  The people I came with had an omelette and french toast and I had a pastrami sandwich.  All was good, but none truly exceeded any expectations, more they underwhelmed them because of all the rave reviews.  This place is cheap and I would assume pretty consistent for breakfast but I don't think it beats out other Las Vegas similarities such as Egg & I.",

It was great to see someone taking pride in their establishment! Whenever we're in Vegas this will be one of our breakfast spots from now on! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

Some of the folks that work there look sketchy (lots of tattoos and a vaguely just-out-of-jail look) but everyone was nice and treated us with respect.   We ordered two meals (the littles ate off of our plates) and three juices. The food was really good. My partner tried the chili cheese omelet (he raved about it) and I got the steak and eggs. I was pleased that they were able to scramble my eggs correctly (soft scramble with onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes) but the steak was nothing to rave about.   Overall, I'd say it was a positive experience. The meal set us about about $40 which surprised me but the food was good so I'm not upset.",

Ordered their Steak and house fries (4/5 for us) but not bad for a steak. It's just we ask for medium well yet it looks well done for us. House fries wasn't oily or salty that's why we liked it!  if ever you tried Mel's Diner chicken fried steak, that's good but dont get me wrong Mr. Mamas version was waaaaaaaaaaay flavorful and it has some textures in it that for me gravy itself is already the bomb!  Pancake was fluffy and buttery, only thing i noticed was the a split second of flour taste in it. Maybe its how it is that's why I'll only give 4/5 for the pancake.  Get their orange juice by the way!   Overall it's still a 5 for me, good food, great service!   Thank you! We had a great time as first timers! Brunch was a blast for our wedding anniversary so far!",

I ordered the Mama's Chicken Fried Steak.  It is not made out of chicken but of beef. It is called Chicken Fried because the minced Beef is fried like chicken (crispy in the outside).  It came with 3 eggs and choice of home fries or hash browns.  The Home Fries are mini potato cubes and the Hash Browns are julienne and pan fried. Both were crispy and not oily.  The Chicken Fried Steak was also not oily.  My meal also came with 2 slices of toast.  I chose Marble Rye, which was already lightly buttered.    My boyfriend decided on the Eggs Benedict Florentine and added Canadian Bacon.  The Hollandaise sauce was delicious because it wasn't salty like the other breakfast joints that serve this. He had a choice of his Eggs Benedict to be cooked easy, medium, or hard.  You also get unlimited coffee refills here.",

    "text": "A busy breakfast and lunch spot that does the standards and more in huge serving sizes.   \"HOWIE!!!\"  I was standing outside waiting for my table, when I was boom called by a deep voice that reverbed all the way down to Mandalay Bay. I don't know the host's name, but damn, his reservation call is like thunder, an impressive at that. No one can ever use the excuse that they didn't hear their name called here!    Anything breakfast looked most popular as we walked in. I know many dig in on the country fried steak, the steak and eggs and the cinnamon rolls. Everything looked good with this being our first stop after coming over from California.   Cinnamon Roll - Warm and spongy with sugar glaze dripping down the sides of the bun with an explosion of cinnamon powder on top. Best cinnamon roll I've ever had? Let's not go that far. But it's warm and gooey and perfect for splitting between two people.   Country Fried Steak w/ Hash Browns and Eggs - This was a meal and a half. The large country fried steak is good, but it's the housemade gravy that makes this dish. The sausage gravy has large chunks of sausage pieces straining to break free from the white mass. My eggs were scrambled and the hash browns were shredded and crispy. I added the onions and peppers for an extra $.50 thinking onions and peppers would be mixed into the hash browns but they just put some cooked diced red and green peppers and onions on top of the hash browns (I think they would have been better inside).   Biscuit - My fat a$$ wanted biscuits and gravy too but I knew I couldn't finish a second dish so I just ordered a biscuit on the side for $1.75 which was way cheaper than getting a half order of Biscuits and Gravy for $6.75. Their biscuit is different in that they slice the it for you, then they put butter on and toss it on the grill. In other words, a biscuit prepared like toast. If you don't want your biscuit toast with butter cooked in, then let your server know beforehand. It went great with my sausage gravy.   My friend ordered a Mamas Breakfast Burrito with Bacon and Avocado and she could only finish half of it. It was rolled thick and is something you can probably split with someone if you want to try some other sides, like pancakes or french toast.   They also do burgers, salads and wraps. On the weekends they are super busy and I thought our wait would be longer but it only ended up being about 20 minutes. Service is really good here with constant water refills and different people checking up on us.  While no one thing wowed me, my stomach left very happy and barely able to move. Consistent breakfast favorites done well, large portion sizes and reasonable prices... No wonder the line is out the door at Mr. Mamas!",

    "text": "We were in Vegas early morning and we wanted breakfast but didn't want the usual franchise spots. I searched Yelp and this place came up, the reviews were good so we decided to give it a try.  It's in a shopping strip center not too noticable unless you are looking. I was getting the kids out of the car and this gentlemen opened the restaurant door and greeted me before I even made it to the sidewalk, asked how many were in our party and got our table ready.   We were seated right when we walked in and I noticed so was everyone else entering the restaurant. They were slightly busy, especially for a Thursday. You can tell this is a local favorite.   Our server claudia came over to for our drink order right away. The menu had plenty of options for breakfast and lunch. I ordered the eggs Benedict florentine and my 2 kids shared a breakfast plate (eggs, sausage,  and pancakes). The food was delicious and fresh. I'm so glad we stopped in and I will definitely be coming back.",

Our server was attentive and professional. Now for the food review. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash.  It looked like your typical canned corned beef hash. The menu reads homemade. I believe them but it did not look appealing at all.  I ordered the biscuit which was dry like sawdust. I will be posting a photo of the Biscuit.  The tater tots were very typical. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Basically a run of the mill cafe.  I am amazed at how many people love the place. If not for the great service I would think differently",

The pros: the corn beef hash is awesome. You can get it as a side even though it's not listed as a side. I could have just eaten this with an over easy egg and been in breakfast bliss. The service is awesome. We had a 40 minute wait and when we got our table, we were greeted enthusiastically by the manager (owner?): a guy that looks like dad from porn stars--I had to look a couple times to make sure it wasn't him. And then they assigned two servers to get our beverage and food a going!  Good work  The cons: be prepared to wait. And the servings are not all that big. In my opinion.   Must eat place off Vegas.",

I placed my order and in the meantime watched the business owner (I assume) cheerfully greet everyone. The food was ready fairly quickly, as should be expected with breakfast. My pancakes were huge, heavy, and thick. If you love hearty cakes then come here and order up. I was definitely full after eating all my food. Nothing spectacular here, but do expect warm friendly service when you visit.",

    "text": "I am really on the fence with how to rate Mr. Mamas.  My server was wonderful, food was ok but I had such a bad experience this was my first and last visit.    The main issue was the manager on duty was very rude and unprofessional.  When our food was brought one order of toast was missing.  The 2 young men who brought our food said \"OK. Is that everything?\"  I started to say \"I think we are missing a toast but...\"  When I was cut off and yelled at by the manager (who was not involved at all with bringing our food) \"They can only carry so much at a time!!\"  I was shocked.  I was speaking very nicely and if he had let me finish was going to say \"but if they haven't made it we don't need it\"  There are no kids menus here so both of my girls (under 10) ordered adult meals which I knew they could not eat and we could not take with us as we were not going home for several hours.  My server rushed over and apologized profusely for him.  I then asked is that the owner?  Still shocked and she said no he is a manager.  I told her I feel sorry for her if he treats customers like that I can't imagine how he treats employees.  I then got to hear him yell at several employees throughout my meal.  Keep in mind we were there early.  There was no wait at this point.  He is yelling at employees to clear tables and in a rude way, not just like he is hustling.  I would be more understanding if there was a wait and employees were slacking off but that was not the case.  I was not the only customer looking every time he yelled at someone.  Oh and our toast came out 10 min later so it wasn't that \"they couldn't carry it\"  I told a couple friends about my experience and they both automatically knew who I was talking about and said they heard him yelling on their visits.    Food was good.  Basic diner food.  Nothing amazing but a solid breakfast.  I had the ABC omelette special.  They were very skimpy with the avocado, there was 4 paper thin slices.  I wish I had taken pics but I was so shocked by the manager that was forgotten. One daughter had bacon and eggs, the other one pancake and a side of sausage.  We all had drinks.  Total for myself and 2 kids (including tip) was just under $50.  Not worth it in my opinion.  The staff other than the manager were very nice.   Two other employees came over during our meal and apologized for the manager.  Our server apologized again several times throughout our meal and also brought us a cinnamon roll on the house.  They are the reason I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 1 star.",

    "text": "I have been working my way through all of the top rated breakfast establishments in Las Vegas (as rated by yelp) as so far, this is the best I have found.  Upon arriving, a friendly gentleman  came outside to greet us in the car park and welcome us in, once inside another gentleman (I believe the owner / proprietor)  welcomed us enthusiastically and we were quickly shown to a table.   Our drinks order was taken as soon as we were seated at our table, and the drinks were delivered very quickly after that. As soon as our drinks order had been taken care of, our waitress (yet another friendly and enthusiastic member of staff) introduced herself and took our orders.  Food arrived fairly quickly, was well presented and most importantly tasted great.  We had Denver omelets, and a side of French toast, and a side of sausage.   The sausage was the flat patty type, nothing spectacular, but good enough.   The French toast was very nice, well presented, nice tasting, not overdone on the flavour and served with warm maple syrup, very nice indeed.  Finally the Denver omelet was excellent! Really nice and tasty, cooked just right, looked really appetising and neatly presented. I had potatoes with mine, which I also opted to have with peppers and onions (which turned out to be a good choice) the peppers and onions were very finely chopped and worked great with the sliced potatoes, which were cooked as close to perfection as you are going to find.  Overall the food was really enjoyable, and left me wanting to return to try other items on the menu. (which I certainly will) The thing that really stands out however, is the service! Everyone was so enthusiastic and friendly, it certainly puts you in a positive mood. I would be surprised if you can find anywhere else in Vegas with service to the incredibly high standard of Mr Mama's, absolutely perfect service!  I purchased a Yelp coupon to use during this visit, and unfortunately I was unable to redeem the coupon as it was showing as invalid when staff tried to process it. Even though this was clearly not the fault of Mr Mama's, staff were apologetic and the owner even offered to effectively give us our meal for free. I could not accept this as the meal was so good and I purchased a second coupon on my phone, which did work fine, now I just need to resolve the issue with the first one with Yelp. This shows how staff are willing to go above and beyond to make sure customers are happy.   I look forward to visiting again and I would wholeheartedly recommend Mr Mama's to anyone!",

The locals rave about this place and it's packed so it's a good situation. Our server was real cool and attentive. I asked her what was the commotion about and she recommended the Mamas special which is the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 turkey bacon and hash browns for $10. So I'm all in. The food takes the normal 20 minutes to make and it comes out looking all outstanding. Fluffy buttermilk pancakes with the perfect texture and sweet taste. The eggs and hash browns were seasoned and garnished with great flavor. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly to the point before it becomes overtly crispy. I ate everything in it's entirety. Great Customer Service all around and if you're a baseball fan you can talk all day with Mr. Mama himself about your team vs his Detroit Tigers. Good food and good peoples.",

Breakfast was so good that we are coming back for lunch on our next visit! I had the home fries with onions and peppers, my friend had the hash browns that had an extra herb spice she said was wonderful! Although the restaurant is full, customers are happy to wait for this amazing place! Don't miss out on this restaurant, it's THAT good! Thank you Mr. Mama for a terrific dining experience!

They are so welcoming and hospitable, you can't but feel like your one of the regulars.  The price is great, the service top notch, and the experience is priceless.

We were able to carry on a brief conversation with even the bus boy.   We started out with their cinnamon roll it was served warm not hot. Not your typical cinnamon roll as you can see it the picture it doesn't look like the traditional roll. Cinnamon flavor was good, and the cream cheese frosting was flavorful.   Husband got the chicken fried steak and he said he liked the flavor of the gravy a little bit of spice, just enough to give it a little something extra. He said his hash browns were cooked perfectly. Cleaned his plate.   I got the Spanish omelette. It was good but I like a ton of flavor so I added salsa and salt to mine. They didn't skimp out on the cheese which I enjoyed. I had homestyle potatoes with onion and peppers added and they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious.   To end we had strawberry French toast (not pictured). They make it with Texas Bread so they are pretty good size pieces. The cinnamon flavor really popped. Had a good crust good without syrup as well. The whipped cream tasted like they make it fresh.   Overall good dining experience prices were decent, especially since my husband and I tend to eat for a family of 4.",

The restaurant is attached to a shopping plaza off of Jones and there is plenty of open parking.   Waking up to the restaurants there is a nice gentleman who opens the door upon entering and exiting for all guest. This same gentleman takes your name and lets you know how long your wait will be. While I was waiting he asked how's your day. You can also get a menu to look over while you wait.  I only waited 3 minutes for my table to be cleaned because I came pretty early in the morning . The menu is a three tier menu and the food options are endless. You can honestly order anything here. I asked my amazing server for suggestions and told her what I wanted and she gave me a delicious combo meal.  I orders sausage, cheese an eggs, house potatoes and a cinnamon bun.   With a packed restaurant my food didn't take long to come out an it was delicious . The food was so delicious that I wanted to bring my fiance the next day for lunch so he could try.   Check it out for some yummy breakfast!!!! You want be disappointed",

He delivered a great life quote, \" you ever cried while eating peanut butter?.\"  The answer is no obviously. Aside from the great team working here the food absolutely delivers. After a myriad of mediocre chicken fried steaks over the last few months. I decided to give the one here a shot and it was over the top good. Tender and flavorful. All the food was good though really.",

Less than 5 minute wait to be seated by Katherine a gracious, caring hostess.  Lourdes was our wonderful waitress. Very friendly chatting and consistent on checking in on us. Meals came quickly, prepared as requested (perfect soft scrambled eggs).  Nik, the owner, came out to greet the guests. My associate mentioned his turkey bacon came 'cold'. Nik wanted to 'make it right' (is that humanly possible? )  Everything else, eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, and my pork bacon (yes, I'm bad like that) was good. Nothing extraordinary, just freshly prepared food at a fair price (two meals and coffee around $20)  Planning to go back if ever on that side of town... I want French toast...(yes, bad meets worse with me)  Will let you know how that goes!",

Was in town staying at The Orleans for one of my last days in Vegas last week. Was in the mood for a breakfast burrito after dining at buffets day after day previously, so I got on yelp in search of breakfast diners. This one came up and I was very pleased. It was about 2.5 miles away from our hotel.   From the moment we were walking up, 2 young gentleman opened the doors for my family and I to walk in, I was like, wow, what a first good impression already.   We were immediately seated and shortly after we were greeted by our server who was awesome. She was friendly and attentive and I wish I remembered her name. But honestly, every last one of the employees we encountered was super friendly and nice. I think just the customer service alone was enough to make me want to come back again. It was a very welcoming environment.  I got a sausage breakfast burrito and my 6 yr old got a quesadilla and one pancake, the size of the plate.The portions were decent and the prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend this place.",

The owner or manager, don't know which one he is honestly, was someone that I could be lifelong friends with. He took our family's pic, was so personable and chit-chatted (both of us are Cali natives) and he reminded both my hubby and I of our bro-in-law, which was a good thing! The food was delicious and homey. Yum! The place gets super crowded with wait time of 45mins plus. We came at a lucky time, so we we're able to enjoy our meal from beginning to end without feeling rushed. We will see you again when we come back out for another mini-vacay!",

Prompt attention given by the server,  I ordered a chile cheese omelet with hash browns. The food arrived quickly,  was hot, was cooked perfectly for me, toast was hot and buttered, hash browns just the perfect amount of crispy. I was by myself so I just watched the customers and staff, Staff worked like a well trained team, customers were eclectic and all happy with thier experience. I am not what could be referred to as a pleasant morning person, Mr Mamas simply made my day. we certainly make this a regular stop.",

After about 50 minutes my boyfriend walked back inside and asked if the table was ready and to the left there were 4 empty tables and she said just to pick which one we wanted to sit at.   We go ahead and sit down and the waitress immediately too our drink our.  However, as we waited for the drinks I was looking around and noticed a girl walked in and told Kat she is a Yelper. They sat her down and waited on her hand and foot and didn't even noticed we were at the next table. This really bothered me because everyone should be treated equal. Yes, you might have gave them \"amazing\" customer service but you lacked on a great chance to give that to another customer as well.    The staff was awesome at getting our food out quickly and man it was delicious!! The Pico De Gallo was to die for! My boyfriend didn't like the pancakes at all and he really upset about it. Especially because we waited so long and he saw me getting so upset about the customer service.   I guess next time I go in I should just say I Yelp and I'll get treated like a queen. ",

I was accidentally missed on the call out and when I went to desk, the manager was awesome in taking ownership of issue and got me seated ASAP. Not only did they apologize to no end but also covered my breakfast. That was great, but so was the food and service. Had the country fried steak with 3 eggs and hash browns. All were cooked very well and had great flavor. I had the homemade sausage gravy on side and ordered a biscuit as well. The biscuit was fantastic and really had a sweet flavor to itself but the gravy was perfect. Bacon, sausage and maple syrup. Will be back!!!",

HOWEVER, as a local who visits this place often & ever since their last location on Decatur, I feel bad for their employees.They treat their staff like robots pressuring them for top notch customer service, but fail to treat their employees as humans, especially in front of their customers. Most people don't recognize this because its a tourist based restaurant. As a regular, we sometimes sit and observe how their employees are treated. Door greeter (normally an older female or the owner) will greet people in and out, create small talk (which is repetitive & predictable at this point which I understand since their hosting tourists), we might as well put our answers on a recording because they dont ever recognize us. They talk down to their staff like they are children, or hollar across the room or scolding them in the corner; which I find unprofessional. Which could explain why some days their service is less wonderful than others.Their employees definitely work hard and are friendly, but they deserve more respect from their supervisors. It reminds me of the saying, \"Customers do not come first, Employees come first. If you take care of  your employees, they will take care of the customers\". Its one thing to show your customers appreciation for the business but its another when you forget who helps you run the business in the first place.",

The French toast was perfectly cooked, the corned beef hash was homemade and had a nice crust, as did the hash browns.  The only reason I subtracted a star is because the service was slow. It was about 7am, there were only 4 tables occupied, but we had to flag another server down for a coffee refill twice. Our server only checked back with us immediately after the meal was served and then was very distracted talking to other servers and being on the phone. Never spoke with her again until after we sat for about 10 minutes with our plates empty in front of us, then we were able to request the check. Because this is one big dining room, she could easily have seen our situation.  We will definitely be back, and in all fairness, I'll update my review at that time. This could have just been an unusual day. Still, I do recommend this place.",

I had the California Omelet, which I turned into a \"scramble\" because I'm weird. It was pretty standard: scrambled eggs, some pico, some avocado, and cheese (I left out the sausage). The meal came with hash browns and toast. Also adopted a couple bites of a pancake along the way from the plate next to mine. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable. Then again, my order was about as plain as possible, so maybe that was my fault.   The service was amazing though. There were more staff then customers when we walked in, and that held True until we left. I'm always impressed when owners/managers aren't afraid to overstaff, and it really makes a difference in the level of hospitality and the overall feeling of the place. Every single employee, including who I believe was the owner, was constantly looking around for a way to serve the customers. If I looked up from my plate or my conversation, someone would immediately walk over to see if I needed anything. They even asked if we wanted our picture taken.  Overall, a good experience. Prices were definitely reasonable, and the location had ample parking. I will be back to see if my next order matches the great service.",

My husband ordered the mamas short stack with scrambled eggs and sausage. I was still a little hungry so I ate some of his healthy serving of pancakes. We both had the iced coffee since it was the daily special and it was just the right combo of coffee and sweet. We even got some to go!

The staff treat each other like family and I admire how nice and helpful they are to each other, which makes for the perfect family atmosphere. On top of that, the food is absolutely delicious and prices are normal, not jacked up 300% Vegas prices. Start your day here! Thanks again for the Birthday Cinnamon Bun! Mmmmm!",

It really comes down to communication and helping to ensure you get exactly what you want; how you want it.   But it's more than that. If you listen, you will become keenly aware of the communication and quality assurance that is happening between the front and the back. Other restaurant owners should come learn from this simple and yet effective approach.   So come eat! I had the chicken fried steak and switched out the potatoes & toast for a biscuit and gravy.",

As soon as my husband and I walked in we were greeted very warmly and told to sit anywhere we like. Right away I liked the feel of the place ( homey, clean and welcoming. ) we looked over the menu and I really like the fact you can have breakfast or lunch or both! I had a strange craving for chili at this hour but I wanted blueberry pancakes too.. Wtf why not both? Lol blueberry not on the menu but the will make it for you ( fresh plump blueberries too). Got short stack (2 huge) and side of bacon ( 3 thick and perfectly crisp) husband got chicken fried steak ( which he said was delicious ) and we shared a bowl of chili with the works. Everything came out so fast fresh and delicious. The service was exceptional and the owner even came around to each table to make sure all was well. I rarely give 5 stars but this place is doing it right. Can't wait to try other items on the menu. Try this place .. You and your tummy will leave happy and satisfied.",

    "text": "This is my third time here and I can honestly say their service and food has been very consistent.  While we were still in the parking lot the owner came out, greeted and opened the door for us, which was a very nice gesture.  As for the food, I always get the chicken fried steak and it is always delicious.  The batter is nice, crispy and adheres to the steak well.  The meat is also very tender.  The country style sausage gravy is creamy and has the perfect consistency with chunks of sausage.   It definitely tastes better than most of other breakfast joints.  My wife has tried their omelettes and they are always flavorful and fresh tasting.  Their prices are also a little cheaper than other breakfast places which is another plus and with their $15 for $30 yelp deal you can not beat it.  Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast.",

I had the Mommas sandwich. Kind of like a club but better. It was fantastic. I got it with hash browns and they were good as well. My mom got the french dip and my dad got a caesar salad and they loved it. Service was fantastic to. I cant recall the waitress name but she was on spot. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back next time I visit.",

Clean restaurant, efficient service (not overly interactive, but always kept our coffee full and took our order quickly). After seeing all the rave reviews on Yelp! we assumed it would be worth the 20 min drive from our hotel. Food was executed effectively and you get what you expect, decent size portions. We had a veggie omelette, the corned beef hash, and a cinnamon roll. My omelette was loaded with veggies, and husband's hash looked pretty good. The cinnamon roll, meh, not much icing and rather dry, although it looked nice on the plate. Was it worth the drive? Well the prices are exceptionally affordable for Vegas, so that's great. The food is worth what you pay for it, no complaints there. There is plenty of (free) parking. It's a good place. I don't know that we'd make the drive again since it was out of the way, but if you are nearer, go for it.",

Everyone, especially the owner, went the extra mile to give us a personal touch and the experience made us feel valued and not just another customer/ticket. The pancakes here are awesome, big and fluffy, and they have good hashbrowns. Hubs really liked his Greek omelette, fluffy and generous, and they subbed in red peppers instead of tomatoes at his request with no problem. I had the Eggs Benny Florentine and I was happily surprised when the waitress asked how I liked my poached eggs, no one has ever asked to make poached eggs to my taste before and most breakfast joints are too busy to accommodate that kind of level of service. The place was hopping but food moves fast and we were never waiting. Great experience to set the tone of the day from a simple meal. I really appreciate the level of service from the staff, it can't be easy.",

I recently moved to the area about 4 months ago and decided to try this place out after finding them on yelp, been hooked ever since. 4 1/2 stars does not do justice!! This place is nothing short of 5 stars ! First I have to say the service is something out of this world. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant with better service.. they are very friendly and personable and make you feel right at home.  EVERY single employee seems happy to be here.. even when it gets crazy crowded they work very well as a team. (So rare these days)  The food is ALWAYS on point , even when we order for pick up, by the time we get home and finally get to eat, the food is still warm and just as delicious !    My fave is the Denver omelette and OMG they have the best bacon everrr! But you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu .

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, we both did. The only thing is that it is a popular place and the wait can be 30-40 minutes. Not so bad but for me, not having a place to seat while I wait is not good, as I have a bad knee. But over all the experience was great. Worth trying out this breakfast place!",

I knew they had good service by the wait time for a table but every few minutes or so they would assure us how much longer we'd have to wait and offered us a beverage. Soon after we were seated I totally forgot how long we waited becuz the food was so good and served smoking. Shawn was really informative as to what he recommend us to order and other eateries to visit throughout the day. I'm so happy we ate here and have so many good things to write about this place that I'd run out of time and space to write, so my final words are \"you won't go wrong here if you  follow your taste buds\"",

We had the steak and eggs, the Jenna wrap, a cinnamon roll, two teas, and an orange juice, and it all came out to about $35. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is because the steak was a little too well done (ordered it medium and it was not even a little pink inside). But I'm still conflicted on this because the rest was so good. Even their toast blew us away. Trust me, put some jam on the toast and eat it after the rest of your meal. Also, the staff is genuinely nice. They're not just being polite. Over all, 10/10 would recommend/repeat.",

I do not make a trip to Vegas without going to Mr. Mamas at least once. Like I mentioned breakfast is breakfast and it can only be so good, but let me tell to this place is as good as it can get. My favorite is the biscuits and gravy, in my opinion they are outstanding. As good as the food is, it is only outdone by the service. The service here is light years ahead of any place you will go. I truly enjoy chatting with Nick when I'm having my meal. Nick's passion is evident, his passion for making your experience a pleasant one, his passion for ensuring you get a quality meal at a fair price, his passion for life, it's evident in one interaction. At a chain restaurant it's the manager/owner's job to make sure your satisfied. The difference with Nick is it's his passion to ensure your satisfied and have a great experience.  That's what separates Mr. Mamas from the rest.  God Bless you Nick keep up the good work.",

Would be awesome if they had some type of modern texting system to let you know when your table is ready as there are a number of coffee shops around that would be more convenient to wait in then standing outside with no chairs.  OBVIOUSLY they are not hurting for business so don't really think the upgrades make a difference to them.    This was a great breakfast/brunch place that we went to twice while in Vegas.  Cinnamon Role was AMAZING literally melted in your mouth Denver Omelet was excellent  Home Fries were INSANE  Chicken Fried Steak was the best my son-in-law has ever had!  Pancake short stack was very good as well. The up-charge to add berries and whipped cream is well worth it!  The thing I loved the most was the atmosphere! It felt like you were family and all the people working there were family as well! The owner walked around from table to table thanking people for being there and asking how everything was. Then he would walk back up to the kitchen and ask all the service staff if they needed any help.    My daughter made the comment that she would have loved to work in that atmosphere.",

The owner Nick came by to greet us as well and tell us a little about himself and the restaurant. When it was time to order, I asked our server Jazmin if the corned beef hash was good. She immediately brought me a sample, and it was delicious! We sat near the kitchen, which I normally don't like but it was truly an enjoyable experience. Ryan has the kitchen moving and ensured accuracy of all orders. We will definitely be back the next time we visit!",

Alex was our server and he was extremely friendly, sweet and very helpful. All the servers seem to work together and help each other out, they have a very great and fast system in place. It's amazing. Our food came out literally so fast, 10 minutes max. I ordered the French toast with eggs and hash browns and my Love ordered the chicken fried steak. All of the food was delicious. Oh and the orange juice is so delicious and fresh, make sure you get a large, it's only like 25 cents more.   Home cooked food with that amazing homey service is something you don't see too often these days but this place has it. It's big enough to accommodate smaller and larger parties.

Krystal was our waitress & the service  was excellent. Also, try the homemade cinnamon rolls. They are soft & warm with a lot of icing and cinnamon lightly sprinkled on top.  We are here on vacation and will definitely return to Mr. Mamas on our next Vegas trip. Highly, highly recommend this place",

    "text": "This was my second time trying out Mr Mamas and I have to say that I was disappointed both visits. Food was good on my first visit but I was dining alone and felt the waitress basically ignored me in order to focus on the tables with more patrons. I didn't leave a review then because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt due to the fact my food was good, nothing spectacular but tasty.   Today my daughter and I went in together because she was craving French toast, which I had the first time I visited and thought it was good. We ordered our food and then due to it being busy sat back and chatted while we waited for our food. When our food came out there was no syrup for my daughters French toast. I had asked the waitress for a side of dressing for my fries and figured she would bring the syrup with my dressing. However we had to ask for the syrup and when my daughter started eating her food her French toast was cold. I told her I would say something but she was hungry enough that she didn't want to wait again for more food. Plus we didn't even see our waitress again except when she was taking the order from the table next to us, and halfway through taking their order turned to us and asked, \"are you still doing good?\" Which I thought was a strange time to check on us. She then only returned after our food was finished and asked if we were ready for the receipt. My water glass sat empty and was never refilled.   I ordered a sandwich with fries and felt it was only average. Fries were just barely cooked, not golden, and had no seasoning. My sandwich had a good portion of meat but just didn't have a lot of flavor, which is strange because it was a Reuben.   Being a new resident to Vegas I often use yelp to find good places to eat but don't plan on returning here. I wanted to like it because the front of house staff are so friendly but after lack luster service twice now after being seated, I think I'll continue to look for my go to breakfast spot. Food wasn't bad but not worth the wait.",

I visited at 11a on a Friday dying to try the much loved and yelped chicken fried steak. I was greeted, or was a by a hostess amongst many at a cashier table near the door. She took my name, noted the time and quoted me 10-15 minutes. Although there were several open tables and not more Than another couple waiting I shrugged it off to wash my hands. And the bathrooms are, ...functional.?.  I also spotted a delicious, largish CFS on the way back to wait.   When I sat down to wait another hostess, checked my name, verified party of one, rolled her eyes ( at the other hostess who didn't seat me) and plunked me down at a nice table in back where I could see the action.   Server came over quickly, took drink order and offered lemon in the water. I ordered chicken fried steak without further delay. She asked if I wanted to try the gravy because \"it's different.\" So I've heard and read. I just said bring it and quickly.  Pancakes walking by,  four high.  Corned beef hash next door.  Water refills quickly, coffee, non stop pour.  Tickets out the window, two stories high.  I'm a fan of Mamas, my, o my!  The CFS was a winning bet. Large nicely breaded and fried. Eggs and hash browns were good. It took almost forever for some wheat toast, but when it came out if it wasn't the softest freshest butterest toast I've ever had. In other words worth the wait. I assume everything is probably worth it here. Mr. Momma came by and razzed me about my Syracuse University shirt. Well Mr Mamma, SU kicked #2 Clemsons arse all night long. Hah! and I love your breakfast. Bye.",

I must say it is good however the steak's breading was a little salty making it hard to finish the big  portion everything else about it delicious.  Hopefully that is not normal regarding the salt.  My eggs were over medium and perfect.  Also my mom ordered the sausage patties with over medium egg.  She is picky and tried to eat all but her portion was too much.  She said she will finish it later.  I also ordered 2 coffees and dropped one as I arrived back at my hotel room.  At $2.95 a cup it was my disappointment for trying to carry everything.

The restaurant name may sound strange but the food is TO DIE FOR!   As we drove into the shopping center on October 14, 2016, we thought no way the parking is full around Mr. Mamas. As we found a parking spot and went into the restaurant, there was the host/manager standing right next to the door ready to serve us in. As we sat at a table, our server was coming her way ready to order.  We ordered: - Orange Juice - French Toast - Mamas Short Stack  We only waited about 6 minutes and the food was coming our way! When I first tried my short stack, I was SHOCKED! I've never seen pancakes so FLUFFY and so HUGE before! The taste of it was just so MOUTHWATERING, it just was so buttery. I also tried a little of the French Toast and it was GOOD also! As I next tried the ham, UMM! SO GOOD! The ham was soft to chew and had GOOD FLAVOR!  The service here was GOOD. It seems the manager and our server cares about their customers since they ask, \"How's the food?\" and \"How's the service?\" This place is a good place to eat, much better than iHop. I RECOMMEND this place because the food comes out FRESH and QUICK especially in big portions! Also, they CARE about their customers' sarisfaction.",

One of the servers even offered to take a picture of us and the food, and we didn't even ask for a picture. They were all super friendly and welcoming!   Now onto the food!  Cinnamon roll - the first thing that came out and it definitely was a treat! It came out nice and hot, like it was fresh from the oven! The dough was soft, buttery, and melted in your mouth. It paired well with the coffee we ordered and set the tone for the rest of the meal.   Cali Omelet - made with 4 eggs, topped with Pico, sour cream, and avocados. And comes with a side of potatoes, I got the home fries. Mmm the fries were delicious! They're diced up potatoes that are fried to be nice and crispy. Loved it! And the cali omelet hit the spot! Little old me could only finish a little more than half of my omelet. But it's so good, I would order it again!  Eggs Benedict - comes with 2 eggs Benedict with your choice of meat. My boyfriend picked sausage. I had a bite of it and it was pretty good! Also comes with a side of potatoes too.   Bicuits and Gravy - a half order comes with 1 biscuit cut into half, a heaping scoop of gravy, and a side. We chose a sunny side up egg. They make their gravy with sausage and a bit of maple syrup. It was a little bland and too meaty for my taste. But the portion was huge, considering it was a half order.   Breakfast done right at Mr. Mama's. Would definitely come back and start my morning there.",

Hubby ordered pancakes and those were delicious! The perfect fluff. Wasn't a huge fan of the cinnamon roll. It was a little dry for me.  If you're in the area, try this place! Wait is long sometimes, but the service definitely makes it worth it.",

We went on a weekend and it was quite busy. The restaurant felt homey and all the workers were very friendly and efficient. We were seated promptly and was given some time to review the menu.   There were so many options and everything sounded so delicious. It didn't help that all the customers around us also had yummy smelling food. I would recommend to review the menu before you visit so you have a better grasp on what you want when you're there.   We finally decided on our order and my goodness, it was so delicious. Good pricing, great portions and well cooked. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast here and will definitely be stopping by on our next trip.",

I'm here to eat food....why would I want to take a picture? And I'm a local! Let me eat...anyway, service was good. Just annoying.   The food was ok. The omelette (Greek) was AMAZING!!!! Other than that, the pancakes were waaay too thick and heavy. Nothing really stood out. The bacon was thin; nothing special. The potatoes were just ok.   So, three stars for service and the omelette.   After my review, the owner wrote: \"It's s shame you weren't in the mood for our kind of service\"????? Shaking my head. No disrespect at all to your resturant. I'm simply giving constructive criticism. Some of your employees are too overbearing. Make strides to improve and be professional instead of making comments like this. For the unprofessionalism alone, taking one star off. Ughhhh :-(",

Lol  The ambiance was what u would expect....no booths but it felt like diner to me. :)  very cute and very cozy.  :)  The staff was very attentive without being intrusive.  I hate it when the waitstaff hovers over u. The staff was there whenever I needed them but they did not intrude on my time with my friend.  So it was good to be able to talk without being constantly interrupted.  :)  Now onto the food. I was hungry so I ordered a little bit of everything.  Lol  Grits were delicious!  Totally made this southern girls day!  Creamy with just the right amount of salt to season it.  They offered me extra butter for it and come on butter makes everything better!  Lol  Biscuits and gravy...seriously one of the best I've had it was soooo good....just thinking about it makes me want to eat it again. I'm drooling just thinking about it. ;)  Corned beef and hash...I love love corned beef....lol I got the hashbrowns extra crispy based off the the reviews that I read on yelp and they did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  Yummilicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked and the corned beef was delicious.  They left it on the griddle long enough for the corned beef to build texture so it was melt in your mouth in the middle mixed with crunchy from the bits from the edges that were perfectly browned on the edges.   In other words YES I will definitely be back.  The other breakfast places better watch out....cuz Mr. Mamas is gonna be stealing some customers!  Lol",

    "text": "What makes Mr. Mamas so damn popular? Two things -- incredible, over-the-top service and affordable prices for some amazing food.   We were on a road trip from California and Vegas was our first stop. We came right when the place opened, which was awesome since I hear Mr. Mamas can be packed during the weekend. First thing you'll notice right away is the service. Everyone from the restaurant was so unbelievably friendly, happy and accommodating that it had to make me wonder -- how are all these people so happy about life? Why are all these people so damn friendly? On my reviews, I tend to focus more on the food than anything else, but their service is on a whole other level.   ... Especially Mr. Mama. Oh yes -- he is real. You'll know who he is right away. You can really tell how much he cares about his customers just by the way he talks.   Food-wise, I really can't complain. Their food is amazing, and the prices very affordable. Amazing, but nothing extremely mind-blowing, maybe except for the Mama's Chicken Fried Steak though. That stuff is bonkers. It was so delicious, and even had a slight crisp inside which I was not expecting at all. I would say if you were to get anything from here, it would be Mamas Chicken Fried Steak for sure.  ---- The Verdict: Mr. Mama gets a well deserved 5 stars because of its amazing food (especially the chicken fried steak) and even better service. I've never felt so welcome in my life.   Recommendation: Mamas chicken fried steak",

They seemed to have been sliced and grilled to add a bit of crust to stand up to the gravy. Speaking of gravy......chock full of sausage, and a unique smoky flavor that I've never had in country gravy. All in all, it was a MEMORABLE breakfast dish (albeit for lunch). Can't wait to return!",

He was super friendly as well as the rest of the staff.  After sitting down I realized he was sitting at a table with someone having a conversation and when customers were coming to the restaurant he would jump up to greet them and was always smiling.  There was an older lady that was walking to the door and he jumped up, went outside and walked her into the restaurant.  That alone will have me coming back.  Customer service in this country is a dying art.  The owner of this place seems to have nailed it.   I ordered the corn beef hash, eggs, hash browns and biscuits with gravy. The corn beef was interesting.  It seemed kind of crumbly.  I don't know how to describe it.  Biscuits and gravy were pretty good.  I have had their chicken fried steak on a previous visit.  That was one of the best chicken fried steaks I have ever had and it's a pretty huge portion.  I will definitely be back to this place.  Great food and awesome service.",

I believe the eggs were cooked first and waited for the bacon.  Our server stopped by shortly and inquired as to how was everything. I let he know, my eggs were cold. She apologized, and wanted to have two more eggs cooked.  I said no thank you, I did not want to wait.  The manager arrived to our table and again, I explained the eggs were cold. She to apologized and wanted to replace the eggs and again I declined. She said she was not sure how it happened as to the order was be place under a heat lamp. I finished my meal.

We like to go when we don't want to deal with the hassle of cooking breakfast in the morning, but we still want the same love that we would put into the food had we cooked it ourselves. Mr Mamas has amazing service and hasn't let me down. I go for a classic breakfast sandwich, usually, but I can never resist a blueberry pancake on the side. Theirs are so fresh and fluffy!! What's also special about the blueberry pancake is that there isn't just one or two blueberries in it. It's really packed with blueberries. My boyfriend loves to get the country fried steak and I always take a bite or two from his plate. That country gravy! Yuuummmm. You just can't go wrong with the amazing food. The service is, however, why we even go to Mr Mamas. You won't be let down. Just know that they can get super busy! Go early if you want to beat the crowd. Otherwise, like my boyfriend and I, understand that there may be a short wait but it will be worth it for the excellent food that you'll have. Nick, the owner, always makes the wait short and sweet--greeting you before you've even entered the restaurant!",

Our waitress was helpful and even let me sample the biscuits and gravy! Speaking of food I had the Greek omelet with bacon, hash browns and the biscuits with gravy. I really enjoyed the biscuits and gravy. The hash browns received good reviews here on Yelp but it was average to me. The omelet was good I enjoyed it. Hubby had a fried egg, hash browns with fried onions and peppers, turkey bacon and grits. He said everything was good but the bacon. I would recommend this place if you are looking for good reasonably priced food. It's about a 10 min drive from the strip.",

I have to be honest, seems they have lost a bit of the personal touch in the new location. the staff doesn't seem to be as happy..  Service was a bit slow. had to ask for a few things more then once. Food was still very good and came out hot. The new location has alot more room which means more seating but lost some of its home family run feeling. The turn over was pretty quick. Nice and clean still which is always a plus.",

I was seated immediately and asked by a host if I wanted a beverage. Our waitress came a few minutes later and introduced herself.  While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, our waitress would come by and ask if there was anything I wanted while I waited and I had any questions. I was already super impressed by the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff.  Once my friend arrived, our waitress explained the day's specials and gave us time to select our items. When we were ready to order, she was within waving distance. I got the egg, cheese, meat sandwich on their homemade biscuit, which was delicious. Definitely recommend the biscuit! I also got the potatoes, which were called home fried (or something similar). I prefer more seasoning on my potatoes, so I think I'll go for the hashbrowns next time. You have the option to get the potatoes fried or grilled, which is neat! My friend got the blueberry pancakes, which were amazing (I tried a bite). Light and super fluffy! I think I'll get them next time!!  My friend and I stayed and chatted well into the busy Saturday morning rush (the waiting area had begun to fill up when we left around 10:30am), but we never once felt pressure to leave due to the crowd. While I completely understand when a restaurant asks you to wrap things up due to a crowd; it's really nice to eat at a place where you can feel like you can take your time and chill with a friend.  The service was great and the food was delicious! Definitely will be back!",

All the waitresses had smiles on their faces and we were greeted immediately at the door. We were sat right away (which was great because we were starving & in a rush) but they are apparently super busy on the weekends. My friend ordered the Cali omelet with the home fries and I can not emphasize how amazing the potato home fries were, they had the perfect crisp! I ordered the half order of biscuits & gravy and the Mamas Stack. I really appreciated that they had some stuff \"half orders\" and we both really enjoyed our meals. Delicious!!!! Also the owner makes sure to greet and chat with every single table, it was a very personable and pleasant experience. We will definitely be dining here again in the near future! :)",

I ordered the special which was the ABC omelette. It had avocado, bacon, and choice of cheese, I chose pepper jack! It was really good. I got fruit instead of potatoes and I am happy I did! The fruit medley consisted of fresh strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, and honeydew. I also got a fresh, hot, buttery biscuit instead of toast. My breakfast was $9 and it came with coffee/ soft drink/ tea choice. I had coffee and it was good and fresh!   Hubby ordered rib eye steak and eggs for $10! He got his with hashbrowns and a muffin and coffee of course!  He mentioned to Julie that we were travelling for 8 hours and she brought him a large take out cup for his coffee and filled it up!

Our server, Jasmine, was pleasant and helpful. Nick, Mr. Mamma himself, stopped by, too. The service was great.  I had the party melt and onion rings. They came out hot and tasty. My vegetarian friend had Mamma's Breakfast Burrito, they were accommodating and replaced the meat with avocado. He also tried the French toast. Everything was well presented, a good temperature and flavorful.  I'd recommend Mr. Mamma's. The only negative thing I can say is that it takes 10 minutes to get there, but it's certainly worth the wait.",

    "text": "I just want to start this review off by saying how i was blown away by the Owner of Mr Mamas, he had plenty of wait staff but was cleaning tables, greeting customers, and seating diners. He interacted with everyone there asking how they were enjoying their meal. The pride he takes in his restaurant bleeds down to his employees as well. He stopped at our table and even shared a joke with my husband about Chicago and Michigan, and kept stopping by for chit chat which we enjoyed. When we were finished with our meal and he check to see how things were my husband asked him if they had corned beef hash on the menu, he lit up and said they did and how it's made from scratch and told him the care they take in preparation, we were pleasantly surprised that he said hold on let me get you a sample. His sample size was almost a portion and it was delicious. How may establishments gives you something for nothing? i don't know many that will, this is the type of customer service i look for in a place, his whole staff was friendly and attentive, makes you feel welcomed and appreciated for dinning there, and that is what he said when my husband thanked him for the corned beef was thank you for coming. OK on to the food, I chose the Steak and Egg and hash browns with onions an cheese. It was cooked to perfection, you just don't know how hard it is to get your steak cooked right the first time, while we were waiting on our food i noticed a waitress bringing someone their meal it was this huge burger and i have got to go back and try it, this is no processed burger(all their beef is angus) it looks like someone was in the kitchen with giant hands preparing the fresh formed patties. My husband chose biscuits and gravy and eggs over easy he was happy to finally find some good quality biscuits and gravy. We are definitely going to be regulars here, if i could give more stars i would that is what a wonderful experience we had and the food is just as great as the staff!",

It was a Thursday morning around 10:00 but there were plenty of people inside; maybe a couple tables were empty.   The menu is pretty basic for breakfast; lots of egg dishes, which seems to be popular amongst the breakfast joints in this area. We both ordered omelets, that were a very decent size (I didn't even finish mine!), then got hashbrowns on the size and they were perfectly browned! Then you get toast as well. Everything was delicious; nothing outstanding but very good. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5; nothing was outrageously delicious that I would dream of it :)  The coffee was amazing!!! Maybe I just really needed a cup that morning but it was delicious! Our waitress was very nice and even offered to give us to go cups of our beverages that we ordered. Everyone of the staff was super nice. My husband wanted go go back the next day on our way back home but I wanted to try as many different places while we were here :)",
