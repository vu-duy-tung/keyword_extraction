If you like dry and bland sausage patties this place is for you. If you like watery grits, this place is for you. The line to get in was close to an hour. I would not have cared if the menu description matched what was served. I felt sorry for the wait staff as clearly it was extremely busy. The manager on duty seemed nice enough, but there was another older gentleman with balding white hair who seemed to treat the other employees like they were slaves. I felt sorry for them. I chose not to complain as the slave driver undoubtedly would have taken it out on the overwhelmed wait staff. Bottom line, tourist joint, phony, fake \"country style food\"",

Fried okra, ohhhhh fried okra.  Just a quick tip; mix a little Mac n cheese with your mashed potatoes and you will thank me later ;) And don't forget to try the sweet tea.

I have had bad experiences almost every visit. the first was the rude hostess when I asked about our wait time. Another time, our waitress forgot about us, the entire meal and we had to ask for a supervisor. 2 different times we were missing items we ordered, and couldn't find our waitress to let her know until she brought us our check. The last time and why we have not been back is because we sat for 20 mins before someone came and took our drink order, then our food was not right and we had to flag down a manager to fix our order and again we never got drink refills because the waitress was not attentive at all. I would say it was because of it being newly opened and it was busy but that was not the case. I hope they get it together because back home i never experienced these problems at Cracker Barrel.",

NOT the case food was horrible... biscuits were dry, gravy had NO flavor... to actually call these biscuits is a disgrace.. everything on my plate was bad.... the potato casserole had no flavor.. ham tasted like it's been sitting under a heat lamp for 3 days... i was shocked that my food was so bad. Service was just as bad.. i would honestly go Denny's or IHOP before i would ever go back here..",

We had a party of 4 adults and 2 children and we waited 1 1/2 hours for a table. The host running the seating podium had no interest in seeing what he could do to help in getting us in sooner after he had skipped us on more than a couple occasions and giving other parties of 6 our seating. We had arrived and checked in long before and unfortunately overlooked by the host. I normally wouldn't be this upset but after seeing the look on the children from being hungry, I wish the host would have been more accommodating to his own mixup..... I get it that the host at the front can make mistakes from time to time, but at least do something to accommodate the customer. A nice customer service reminder training would probably help.",

This seemed to be a standard practice here.  I guess Cracker Barrel wants its patrons to stand and hover while their hard working bussers bust their ass?  Talk about tacky.   2. When the server says \"you will have to excuse me, I'm very under the weather...\". I guess when the company is too cheap to move to California because it would have to pay its servers minimum wage, you get severs coming to work spreading their illnesses.    3. Why the hell eat here when you're in Vegas?    4. Other than the eggs I'm convinced everything is frozen and reheated in the microwave and deep fryer and covered in gravy and pasteurized cheese food product.  Just like Arby's.   5.  Don't touch the stupid peg game.  The kid next to me was using pegs to extricate something from his nose.   6.  Why the hell eat here when you're in Vegas?",

I ordered a veggie plate and instead of getting a plate, I got 4 bowls which makes it hard to eat in the car when traveling. First, mash potatoes were nasty, the turnip greens had meat which I am vegetarian so that's a no fly zone for me and the biscuits were under cooked. Also not to mention they just left out the corn bread because it wasn't ready without telling me. Really? Sorry but not sorry I will never eat at this location again. Also this place was slow and it took 30 minutes to get my food. There were several people who were not happy about the service and food as I was leaving. The front clerk Gabby was a delight.",

    "text": "I've been to other Cracker Barrels.  Most are decent food and service worth at least 3 stars.  This Las Vegas location was extremely disappointing, even compared to others of the same franchise.  The wait times are long which is pretty normal for this chain.  There is a system that allows you to put your name on the waitlist online ahead of time to reduce the time spent once there. The greeter had a fake smile and no warmth to her at all.  She gave us grossly inaccurate wait times, stating 90 minutes when it was about 20 minutes and had a self-satisfied smirk as we discussed whether we should go somewhere else.  The waitress was friendly but not particularly enthusiastic about her job.  She got several components of the order wrong and had to be reminded a few times.  A manager or supervisor came around to check on the tables which was appreciated but really didn't do enough to overcome other issues.  The food is always the most important component and was an abject failure.  Nearly every component of the food served was inadequate.  Eggs over easy came over medium and over hard.  The buttermilk biscuits were underbaked and we had to bring them home and put them in the toaster oven for 5 minutes to fix them.  The gravy and sausage was somewhat bland.  The cheesy hash brown potatos were not cooked all the way and the potatoes were still somewhat raw.  They were again better after microwaving at home for a few minutes.  The pancakes were about the only success and one of there better items.  They had crispy edges and a pleasant caramlized taste.   There are far better options for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I will avoid this location in the future.",

We did't wait long at all- not more than 5 minutes! I ordered the Cracker Barrel Sampler, since I was a bit overwhelmed with the menu. It came with chicken n' dumplins, meat loaf, and your choice of sugar cured or country ham. I opted for the country ham and also got buttermilk biscuits on the side. Our friend ordered corn bread for their side and it took a while to come out since they were baking- but still nothing amazing. I wasn't crazy about the dumplins. It had gravy over it but I felt like I never got a bite of chicken. Just the soft dumplins. Then the meatloaf was okay but underwhelming whilst the ham was a bit salty.  Overall, the food was quite subpar. I most likely won't return- not really my cup of tea. I love comfort food but this did not hit the spot.",

I have a daughter in a wheel chair and her friend was also with us that is in a wheelchair  I don't mind waiting my turn,  but when  10 parties are called ahead of me  I find that hard to accept .  The host told us they were trying to make room for us  But when a party of 7 is seated that came in after us.  I find it hard to believe that they could not make room for us. A party of 2 that came in after us including a wheel chair was also seated before us.   After we were finally seated.  I looked at the table next to us and the had a small puppy with them and they were passing the puppy back and forth around the table.   The dog hair was flying in my directions  I asked to speak the the manger but he failed to come by my table.  So I went looking for him and voiced my concerns  He told me they would be leaving soon. And did nothing  His name was Dan   I asked if the dog was a service dog and maybe it was being trained but he said NO it just their pet  .  I feel that is very unhealthy to say the least when food is being served and dog hair it all around.  And the food was AWFUL  cold not brought out in a timely manner.  All in all one the WORST visit I have ever had in any restaurant.  I will be telling all my family and friends to NEVER visit the cracker barrel in Las Vegas.   Friends don't let friends eat here.",

This place was so crowded I was convinced the food must be the best ever. It was a Friday so I ordered the fish & chips. I have had fish & chips at many places in the US and abroad. What I was served was the most bland mediocre substance that they presented as fish. The fish had a rubbery texture and tasted like it was cooked from frozen then breaded and served. The \"fries\" were chunky and crispy. I looked at the other stuff my co-workers also got. The presentation is so sloppy. I have no idea why people are willing to wait hours to eat this bland mediocre food. The staff is friendly though. I bought some fudge in the gift shop and it had this off taste to it, the texture was also way too soft like the sugar got hot enough to reach the soft ball stage. Avoid, avoid, avoid- Silverton's coffee shop must be better...",

They finally brought out our eggs that were hard boiled - not poached.  By then all the other stuff was cold.  We said we couldn't eat this junk.  The server (Kathy) again apologized and said there would be no charge and please try us again.  The manager never re-appeared.  I gave the server a tip and we left to have breakfast somewhere else.",

This one has the same great food that they're famous for.  However, two stars must be deducted for the SLOW service. It's so slow, it's created a horrible back up and an unreasonable wait time.  On a Monday mid-morning in the off season (I shudder to think what a weekend would be like) it was 35+ minute wait for a seat and then 30+ minutes to get your order.  (Which was then completely wrong and had to be redone!).  If you do decide to stop, make sure you leave plenty of time and I'd advise you use the website to \"call ahead\", which I didn't know about until today.",

I declined.. why recook the item if  you insist that you haven't changed how it has been prepared ..  I am disappointed that the Fried Haddock preparation has changed.. I loved this item  I will never return again to Cracker Barrel again..I have given you several chances & my experience has been less than pleasant..

    "text": "Definitely a solid 2 stars - unfortunately.  I was very excited to try Cracker Barrel because a lot of my FB friends raved about it.  All the food was very underwhelming.  ATMOSPHERE The establishment is very cute.  I loved all of the decorations they had.  It was all very rustic and really encompasses the epitome of what I imagine a cabin in the country would look like.  I loved it.  It's the reason why I gave this place 2 stars.  CUSTOMER SERVICE Customer service was great.  From the hostess to the servers, they do a good job to make you feel welcome and a good job taking care of you.   FOOD I ordered the EGG SANDWICH and the BISCUITS & GRAVY WITH BACON.  The sandwich was fine.  I ordered my eggs over medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The yolk was a little runny, but all the whites were cooked through.  Runny whites remind me of snot.  Gross!  The sandwich comes with the eggs (2), a few slices of tomato, and mayo on sourdough bread.  It was good.  Especially because I added the bacon that came with my biscuits and gravy to it. SO GOOD!  Except, I like my bacon chewy rather than crispy - which is how they make their bacon there - crispy.    The BISCUITS & GRAVY was very underwhelming.  The gravy was very bland, and the biscuits, although cooked well, were good, but nothing memorable.  Even after adding salt to the gravy, it still didn't fix it.  I feel like it needed more sausage or something.  My friend ordered the SAMPLER PLATTER which came with eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, grits, and biscuits and gravy.  I tried the sausage and it had good flavor, but was overcooked and VERY dry.  The ham was overly salty.  The grits were bland... Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but, it wasn't pleasant. Even after adding some butter.   OVERALL For the first time trying this place, I definitely wasn't wow'd.  I'm not sure what people were raving about because the food that was served to us was sub par.  Sorry, Cracker Barrel, I definitely will NOT be a returning customer.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars!  Even though we gave it a few months before we attempted to visit Cracker Barrel, it was SOOOOO crowded!  Seriously, the walk-in wait was at least an hour and a half for a Saturday morning!  Luckily we used the online wait list on the Cracker Barrel website to reserve us a table.  Wait was still 45 minutes, but much of that time was taken up by us driving across town to get to the restaurant.  If you have the option to use the online wait list I suggest you do it!  Unless you LOVE sitting outside in one of their many rocking chairs.  Cracker Barrel entry was pure chaos!  Even walking into the restaurant you're greeted with a crowd swell of people.  That's probably because the restaurant itself is connected to their 'old country store'.  Which is speak for, \"Please spend way more money with us then you ever intend to!\"  We still had a 10 minute wait before being seated so we wandered around the country store to see what goodies we could find.  Very kitschy but kinda fun just to look.  However be careful because you need to control traffic with the TONS of other folks walking the store, not to mention the line of people waiting to pay their food bill!  Be prepared to be in tight spots.  Coming to Cracker Barrel on a weekend can almost be considered a mistake.  The restaurant is so busy and CROWDED!  Really, there was not one empty table when we dined that day.  Soon as one was cleaned up it was almost immediately filled with the next party.  That being said, service was a little rushed.  Our server was brand spankin' new (like as in he started 2 days prior) so he was still trying to get around the menu and the restaurant service.  He answered our questions to the best of his knowledge, got confused a few times but was pretty apologetic about it.  Our family ended up ordering:  -Sunrise Sampler (2 orders) - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole, homemade buttermilk biscuits, sawmill gravy, smoked sausage, country ham & thick-sliced bacon  -Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole & smothered country fried steak  Order took a long while - nearly 30 minutes!  I ordinarily would start to throw a tiny fit especially at breakfast but this is what I signed up for with an overcrowded place with fairly new staff.  Thankfully though our food arrived still very hot.  Fresh @$$ biscuits!!  These were the first thing I jumped into, and damn they were worth the calories!  Buttery, a little flaky, warm - delicious with a side of apple butter or some fried apples on top!  I ate 3 of them before I could notice.  Don't hesitate for a refill of biscuits, our server was more than happy to give us a few more.  Our breakfast platters ended up being just so-so, just OK.  Food was warm but the over-easy eggs were overcooked so they weren't as yolky like I like in the middle.  The hashbrown casserole was kind of a one liner - I really don't like soggy potatoes, I wish it was fried on the flattop with a more crisp exterior.  For myself at least, the samples of sausage, ham & bacon weren't anything special.  Tasted just like the breakfast meats you find at your average breakfast diner chain.  Wifey said her country fried steak was tasty - I did have a bite and I have to agree.  Was fried well, and covered with that white gravy it was so rich, after a few bites it would probably be too much.  The food was overall OK with us but very HEAVY, some stick-to-your-ribs type affair.  We had a lot of leftovers to take home with us, even after we were done we still had 2 full takeout boxes!    It's not particularly cheap to eat at the Cracker Barrel, for our family of 3 it ended up coming to over $45 easy after tax + tip.  Just above average pricing for breakfast but still, I like value ya' know??  I could have gotten breakfast at other restaurants for less.  But we were glad we made the drive at least once to check out Cracker Barrel.  No longer have to really drive here though to have it again...we now have one on our side of town right near Craig road!  May have to visit this one the next time I get a biscuit craving!  #applebutteringmybiscuits",

    "text": "I stopped for lunch with high hopes of delicious comfort food in a cozy atmosphere. After entering we were rudely greeted by Susan- the seating service. She was not very welcoming and her expression showed annoyance towards customers. We waited about 20 minutes for a table which is reasonable during lunch rush hour. The store and restaurant were clean but very busy and the staff seemed rushed and a bit overwhelmed. The waitress was okay but far from being welcoming and friendly. She got the job done. I personally found it unprofessional that she threw the straws for our drinks on the table while running by on her way to the next customer. The food came out relatively quickly and was okay but not exceptional. I will not recommend this location to anyone. It felt more like a fast food restaurant than a table service restaurant because of the attitudes of the personnel.",

    "text": "I had breakfast today and my server was kathi. Very sweet lady, very kind and funny. There was a moment after our food was delivered when I asked the person that brought the food to our table to bring more syrup. It never came. No one ever refilled our drinks. The meal took a while to get to us so our drinks were pretty much empty when the food got to our table. So we had no drinks through our entire meal. Eventually we got full and looked around and found no servers. So I saw two people that worked there (not servers) chit chatting by the fire place and I waved at one to come over to me and I apologized perfusly I said I'm sorry I know that's rude but (I explained my grievances) she couldn't give two f's about our problem. She was a GSS named Amy. The experience I had with her as it was brief, it was awful. As I explained to the cashier my impression that Amy gave me was raging Bit*h. Very unpleasant and left an awful taste in my mouth. Lastly, as I walked by her and someone else she was talking to, I overheard her making fun of me and my \"problems\". WOW if you treat customers this way I feel bad for those that work with and under her. She must treat them like garbage. I've worked as a server and in retail and the way she treated me and servers was a disgrace. Let's get off our high horse and help out because obviously your team needed help. I'm not sure what GSS means but I sure as hell don't hope it doesn't mean manager. End rant.   Food was yummy as always! I gave two stars, one for kathi and one for the food. TIP: go on their app or website and put your name on the waitlist to avoid really long waits.",

    "text": "Comfort food, but potions underwhelming.  Like many other Yelpers, we've been to more than 1 Cracker Barrel. We jumped with joy that this is the closest location to California, without having to drive to Yuma, Arizona for our fix.  This place is truly a comfort southern food  establishment, from getting grits to fried anything to chicken and dumplings.  Most of the food is in the \"yellow\" category so if you're looking for fresh vegs and fruits, this may not be your place.  With that being said, the portions here are puny. I said it.  Compared to my last experience in well, anywhere USA, I was so disappointed that Las Vegas serves up kids size portions compared to their other restaurants.  Normally I could share my sides with someone, and in my last visit, we hoarded our food.  They also need to figure out how to make a biscuit and cornbread. The biscuit I had was pale (as in no color) and the cornbread was hard as a rock.. you could use it for batting practice.  Even with the apple butter, it was not good, and it would take too long to flag down a server to replace both breads.  If you're a fan of CB, then stop by.  If you come on weekends after 8 am, expect to wait over an hour.  Tip: Go to the CB website and add your name to the wait list.  There is a store finally coming to California in Victorville. They have not broken ground yet, but I sure hope they are not underwhelming like this vacation.",

    "text": "We were on vacation and my wife said she had never eaten at a Cracker Barrel.  Well, I had never been to one either, so we figured why not.   The parking lot was full and there was people waiting outside, so it was pretty busy. As you enter the restaurant, there is a store front where they sell various items from toys, gadgets, clothing, and decor. It was interesting. Our wait time was about 15-20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering the amount of people there. I peeked into the dining area and noticed that there were lots of tables and seating, most of which was occupied. I was glad to see this because it meant that even though there was a lot of people waiting, people would get seated shortly since there was a lot of tables.   I ordered the hamburger steak, eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy. This was all included in one meal! So if you like large portions of food, you will not be disappointed here. The food was pretty good. It was equivalent to other diner style restaurants and I was not disappointed. Their biscuits were fluffy, and the gravy was thick. My wife ordered the fried pork chop meal, and she said it was good. Being our first time here, we enjoyed the food. I would love to give this place four stars, but as I stated earlier, it was equivalent to most diners. Service was friendly, and for the most part attentive. I'm sure that f we are in the vicinity of a Cracker  Barrel again, we would probably give it a try.",

First issue...when we put our name on the list, we were told a 40 minute wait. We ended up waiting over an hour to be seated. Second issue...it took over 30 minutes for us to get our food only for the waitress to come out and say \"we're out of Mac & cheese I think that's the hold up for your food\". After she confirmed that there indeed was no more Mac & Cheese, we had to choose a different side. Mind you it's only 1:30pm and they still have 8+ hours before they close . Third issue...every time we asked for something it took forever for the waitress to return with an answer or the item we asked for. Fourth issue...our food items came out individually. By the time my cornbread arrived to the table, I was already done with my meal. Overall the food was very bland and I likely won't be coming back. The hype is in the name! Anyone that thinks this is good ole southern food doesn't know good food at all and should not be trusted! The 2 stars is for the store! ",

Well next thing you know our food came out and my chicken pot pie look dried out. Overly cooked and I tried to eat it. Super dry and the crust was like sand. Also I had to go and ask the manager for silverware. She looks over at my table and makes a joke.  Says today is eat with ur hands. Lol.  Ok no big deal. Then I had to ask another waitress to find my waitress. She finally came and I showed her my meal. She said oh that doesn't look good. I think it was the last one.

We went there Friday and he had the chicken strip dinner with 3 sides and I had the Friday Fish Fry with 2 sides plus both dinners came with bisquits.  Good Portions and fair prices.  Great service but my only complaint is that they put soda in pitchers and it comes to the table in a glass but it is flat.  For the price that is charged I would like a fresh bubbly soda not one that tastes like it has been sitting for a while and is flat. I understand that probably saves time but I am not happy with that process.   I guess I will do without the soda next time unless that gets improved because the food is excellent and worth it but not the price of a flat boring tasting soda.  That was the only disappointing part of our visit",

    "text": "Husband & I are huge fans of Cracker Barrel & love hitting up different locations on our road trips! However, our local cracker barrel has really dropped the ball this morning. My hamburger patty was so over cooked I needed a knife to cut it. I couldn't actually imagine the same meat in an actual hamburger, it'd break someone's teeth! My husband's fried apples had a total of 4 measly apples included, I had to actually take a picture of those! 2 tabs of butter couldn't rescue the dried out grits either.   After we were finished with our meal we waited quite a while before the waitress finally checked up on us so we could ask for a to go box. In the meantime, I might have been able to ask the manager for a to go box instead but he COMPLETELY skipped over our table during his \"rounds\". Like literally asked the table in front of us if everything was ok then walked past my husband & I & proceeded to ask the table behind us if everything was ok. Looked like he asked the whole restaurant before returning to us AFTER the waitress had finally been around.   Overall the Vegas local just doesn't seem to really care like the other locations we've stopped at had. The food is sub par & the service is always lacking. Really disappointed I waited years for a local location to be so let down.",

    "text": "I've been to many a Cracker Barrel, in many states and my family and I love Cracker Barrel! But this restaurant was by far the worst! The service was slow and I had to track down a waiter/waitress for drink refills. We had two servers and neither of them were around much even though the server in the next section was around all the time and taking care of her customers.   The corn bread was horrible and dry with little taste. The butter was frozen and wouldn't spread so basically it was worthless. When our food finally arrived my chicken and dumplings was a lump of tasteless dumplings in a sea of gravy with NO chicken. I don't like to send food back or complain about it because I'm scared that the server or cook will do something to my food. My wife just gave me the cold chicken from her chicken salad to add to my Chicken-less chicken and dumplings.   After receiving a check where they messed up the charges, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pay the check while the only cashier endlessly talked and chatted with the two customers ahead of me. When I finally got to the cash register I didn't yell, I wasn't rude or upset but when the cashier asked me how my experience was I told her the truth, it was horrible. When she asked if I wanted to speak to a manager I told her I didn't have time since my family had been waiting in the car, in the 111 degree Las Vegas heat, for the last 10 minutes while she chatted with the previous customers and I told her that I doubted waiting any extra time for a manager would help the situation. Now she just became the cashier that just wanted to get an unsatisfied customer away from her cash register. She didn't even fix the charges when I brought them up. The food and experience wasn't worth the overcharged $53 bill, which was reluctantly paid. This franchise won't get anymore of my money.",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel has many goodies in their pantry, but a seasoning cupboard is not one them. The food is not exactly pricey or horrible, but very bland. Based on the southern recipes I grew up with from my great grandma, I know older style cooking typically has less seasoning than the cuisine aimed at more modern palettes. However, even fat and salt aren't enough to give their classic chicken and dumplings any interest (they were the worst of my sample platter - imagine chicken pot pie but without colorful veggies, crunchy crust, or taste).   The ham and meatloaf faired better but still are nothing to go out of the way to get (I have had better ham from a little breakfast burrito place wedged in a small strip mall). The mac and cheese was the biggest disappointment. Blandness aside, it felt like watered-down Stouffer's with a thin sauce that felt neither creamy nor cheesy. I enjoyed the fried okra (similar to a drier and non spicy fried jalapeno), but it could use a dip or seasoning salt. The best thing on the plate was the hash brown casserole which aside from being cheesy had pepper (which they really should introduce to their other offerings).   Biscuits are good. However, likes everything else, they aren't that impressive (maybe I have been spoiled by Mrs. Knotts). Also they came slightly after the meal... before would have made a nice little appetizer to spread out the eating process  like butter.   Also, you get to wait in a line in a cramped store to pay. Yay.",

    "text": "Mmm, Cracker Barrel.  The thought of it makes me nostalgic about cross-country road trips - east to west and north to south.  Driving back from Cali a little less than a month ago I noticed a billboard stating the grand opening would be July 25, 2016, so I immediately got excited.  IKEA can wait but Cracker Barrel couldn't, so I stopped by for an early dinner today only to see an expected line of people outside awaiting their turn while rocking in wooden rocking chairs under misting fans and hanging/shading burlap - although the entrance faces east.  I knew I didn't desire to wait two hours to be seated, so I searched on their website for online ordering or perhaps telephone ordering.  The wait for an online order was two hours as well; but, fortunately, I called and the wait for a telephone order was only 30 MINUTES!!  So, pre-order by calling ahead, but be sure to eat it right away - we wouldn't want all that yummy country goodness to get cold.  I ordered Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast which is two scrambled eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, homemade buttermilk biscuits with real butter and strawberry preserves, fried apples, and Country Fried Steak.  Mmm mmm, breakfast for dinner, $11.13.  Enjoy!",

The hostest brings us to a table and hands us a set of silverware wrapped in a napkin.  Of the five last visits, three times the silverware was really dirty with noticeable food debris on them.  That is gross as someone obviously wrapped the silverware up in the napkins and did not notice the food debris still on the silverware!  Apparently there is no quality control in that process.  Last visit I waited until the hostess came back  to seat others and told her about the problem with the silverware and that we needed new sets.  She sent the Manager over to speak with us.  He apologized and got us new sets.  We were still yukked out and wondered what other QC problems there were.  We ordered and it took a very long time for our beverages to appear.  Our salads arrived about thirty seconds before our main dish arrived. The biscuits that used to come before the dinner never appeared until we asked if they still served them.  The biscuits finally arrived after we finished our meal, just in time to be our dessert.  Las Vegas has so many good restaurants, and this is not one of them, even though the price is right, the Haddock main dish is so tasty, and the store is really cute.  We probably will not be back or, if we do, we will bring out own eating utensils.  Cracker Barrel Corporate, this site needs your attention ASAP as it is a detriment to your brand!",

After explaining to the waitress twice which plates we were  still missing they finally got all of our completr order on to the table. It had now been about 2 hours and 15 min since we arrived.  The fist table that was seated after us now had been cleaned with new patrons ordering but we were just grateful to have something hard and dry to crunch on.

We had so much food we ended up taking home 3 carryout containers. We ordered pancakes, homestyle chicken and a steak/egg breakfast. Everything came with sides and to top it off they brought us a side of biscuits. Being from the midwest with a southern upbringing this place made me feel at home. I WILL be returning again.",

The waitress took our drink orders pretty quick (9 waters and 5 fountain drinks), she came back with our fountain drinks right away, but it took almost 20mins after that just to get the waters. Then it took another 20mins to get our food. I was seated at 7:30pm, and didn't get my food till almost 8:30pm. They need to get it together. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon.",

My first impression when I entered the dining room was that it was like a school cafeteria with rows of long tables. Turns out there are separate tables but jammed so tightly together there's barely room to walk.      What impressed me the most was the horrendous noise. We couldn't talk, we had to shout  at each other. With wooden floors and wooden ceilings there's obviously no effort made to reduce the sound. This is a brand new building, and you would think that whoever designed it would have considered the noise and crowding factors, but apparently not. Seems the plan was to jam as many people in the dining room as possible and forget about comfort. If you're looking for charming ambiance and \"a fine dining experience,\" do not go here.      I liked my chicken fried chicken, and our waitress was fine. We didn't have to wait very long for our food, and it was warm upon arrival, but because of the noise, we'll never go back.",

You will be sorely disappointed if you are used to Cracker Barrel's from the East Coast. We were seated immediately, and that was the last time we had any employee interaction. Even though there were at least 5 servers and 1 manager where we were seated, not ONE of them came over to say hi. People who were seated after us were served before us! We waited for about 15 minutes and just decided to leave due to lack of service. Do yourself a favor and visit the Silverton Buffet across the way instead, their customer service is 100 times better than anyone at this Cracker Barrel could offer. I wish I could give them zero stars.",

By some reason so many people, who arrived far later, passed ahead of us and our waiting time was about an hour! It was sooo loud inside, we barely headr each other, kids were so hungry and tired, so started to cry.

So when they opened one here, I thought ok great 'Breakfast'.  I have been to this location three or four times. I believe a couple times for breakfast which is your standard breakfast items and truthfully a restaurant would have to drop the food on the floor and scoop it up in order to screw up a standard breakfast. It really was your standard eggs, potatoes, grits, toast and breakfast meat deal. No whoopee.  I did dinner here and my daughter called it \"Old people food\" meaning the food was bland and ordinary. I thought it was a bit better than a Swansons Hungry Man mean, so very average!  So for the desserts, that is where the redemption starts and endfs. I will say the Coca-Cola cake and the Apple Dumplings are very good and probably the only thing decent at any Cracker Barrel.  As for the service at this Cracker Barrel, they are very fast and quite friendly but everything is still just average.",

Their food is always great the service is usually awesome and the ambience and experience is usually one to remember. Cracker Barrel has that mom and pop feel with Denny's prices. They also have a convenient store that sells nostalgic collectibles as well as oldschool feel chocolates and suites, and also snacks and toys for your kids. If you have enough time you will easily get lost while looking for something to purchase.  Our waitress was extremely nice and it was actually her second time serving me since I've been going to this Cracker Barrel each time I'm in Las Vegas. They have their own sauces and it taste delicious. They're very accommodating and it's always packed as well - that sure tell you something! Cracker Barrel for me should be historical landmark everywhere, but since it isn't I'll just support it and continue going. I highly recommend you check it out!!  #EatHereOrNot #EATHERE",

Wait is definitely on the longer side, but that's what the shop is for. The service was fine and prices were fair, but the food was really not worth the wait. It reminded me of my elementary school's cafeteria food which made me happy with childhood nostalgia at first until it dawned on me that regardless of how happy of a childhood I had, no restaurant should ever remind anybody of their elementary school's cafeteria food.   But that's exactly what it was. No exaggeration. No lies. Just truth.  Only come here if you REALLY wanna find out what it's like. But if you're looking for good food and good food is your priority, go somewhere else.   Tip: If you're gonna buy a soda for your meal anyway, save yourself a few dollars and just buy a bottle from inside the store. They sell the same exact sodas inside the retaurant as they do in the store but charge more in the restaurant for some reason.",

    "text": "Haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in a long time...so we went there for lunch. We were seated promptly and then waited for quite awhile for our drink order to be taken.  My husband ordered the special, Parmesan chicken pot pie. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad. After some more waiting my husband was served his meal. The waitress who served his main course asked if I had ordered a meal and I told her I had, the Caesar salad. She smiled and told me she would check on my meal.  My husband started eating slowly....and I waited....and waited. Another waitress came by and asked if my husband needed a refill on his ice tea.  ...and I am still waiting...and waiting. By now my husband is almost halfway through his meal.  The original waitress returned with my husbands iced tea. My husband asked her if she could check to see how my meal was going. She looked at me and said, \"you haven't been served yet?\" My husband had to remind her what I had ordered. She told me she would check on it.  ..and I am still waiting....and waiting. She returns several minutes later and states \"they didn't read the ticket correctly.\" By this time my husband has finished eating...the waitress says to him, \"you look like you are almost done eating. Well the salad was alright but this salad is served with a deviled egg. The egg white was old and rubbery. Oh yeah and my husbands meal was, \"ok\". It didn't look like the picture, that's for sure. It has to at least resemble the picture...., right? We left a 10% tip. I hope the waitress gives it to all the other people working behind the scenes at a restaurant.",

To start, when we arrived we were told about 15 minutes for a table, it took at least 30 minutes. When we got in there were no issues during the drink/food order. Once our food arrived I had to ask if we were getting our cornbread and/or biscuits with our 3 meals that I knew came with them. She said with an attitude that my sons did, then looked at my plate and my Dads and said, \"well I guess those do too\". She then finally brought the biscuits and cornbread. It took another 20 minutes to flag her down for a water refill and to order a to-go plate for my husband at home. During that order I had asked for no tomato and asked for a refill for my sons sweet tea. My son NEVER received his sweet tea refill and my husbands sandwich, you guessed it, had tomato.   Fast forward to the cash register as I am checking out. I used my debit card and input my pin number and it said approved. The lady said it must have timed out and I had to do it again. I said it had said approved and she said I had to do it again, so I did. I immediately checked my online banking app and sure enough, I was charged twice. Amy, the manager says that only one will go through (though it still shows I have already been debited twice since I used my pin number).   I will NOT be back there again. I have never been so disappointed in a food establishment, especially one that I usually have no issues with. It doesn't matter how good food is when the service is so disappointing.",

    "text": "More than an average, 3-star rating for a Cracker Barrel? Yes, and I'll tell you why... If it was up to food alone, it'd be just an average breakfast/brunch restaurant chain for me. It's got a decent variety of menu items, and the food doesn't have me doing spirit fingers or whatever, so it's just up to par with other decent chains (e.g., Black Bear Diner). My favorite part of the meal happened to be the pancakes my sister ordered, which came with a cute little bottle of syrup. Can't argue with the prices either. Let's see... 2 coffees, stack of pancakes with a side of bacon, and Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast for like $27 (excludes gratuity). Not bad at all. I'm actually bumping it up a full star for the customer service provided by Denirra (sp.). Super nice lady that was quick on her toes. She continuously checked on us, even with a large area of the restaurant to cover. Made sure my sister was content, providing a bit of witty remarks about her bringing me there before a dress fitting. LOL.  It's a bit hokey, but I realize it's a country store vibe. It made my sister happy to go shopping for the pancake mix and syrup.  Overall, it was a good experience.",

He had me try the breakfast menu, which apparently is available most if not all day? I ordered blueberry pancakes and biscuits and gravy with sausage. He got a breakfast sampler. The sausage was smokey but dry, and I wish I skipped it. The biscuits were perfection. The gravy needed a little more flavor but was still decent. What really knocked it out of the park is those blueberry pancakes.....buttery, blueberry, pancake goodness served with the best blueberry syrup and maple syrup!!! I also had a bite of his fried apples and hashbrown casserole, which are both fantastic! Our waitress today was incredibly friendly and kind, which put things on an extra positive level for us.

Service was good, waitress was on point.  But they sat us under the ceiling fan, and it was so cold.   I was trying to hurry up and eat so I can get back outside to the 100 deg weather.  I got the fried cat fish.  It was good, next time I will have them fry it a little longer, or make it extra crispy.  It 's a good place to go when I don't want to cook it at home, and it's a lot closer than the other place we go to.  My sides were pretty good, specially the brussel sprout mix I had with the cranberry's in it, and it was sweet.  Next time I will pass on the mac n cheese.  I also took a bite of my husbands meatloaf.  I've had better, it just tasted like a blob of ground beef to me.   But he liked it.   I think next time I will stick with the breakfast.

    "text": "So I've heard so many good things about this place and I know people stormed this location when it first opened up in Las Vegas. I always wanted to try it but we never had the time or the patience to wait in the crazy lines.  Well we finally came to try the place and we were not disappointed! As you walk in there's a little shop with clothes, candies, old fashioned soda pops, little trinkets and a bunch of other stuff. I almost got too distracted and wanted to shop but hubby was too hungry to allow that.  We were quickly seated and our server Suki was immediately there taking our drink orders. Now I know they're just drinks but the sweet tea and raspberry iced tea were both amazing. Not too sweet and still had the tea taste unlike other places.  I ordered the spicy grilled catfish and hubby ordered the country fried shrimp. Each entree came with 3 sides so we ordered the \"dumplins\", hash brown casserole,  whole kernel corn, macaroni and cheese, sweet baby carrots, and homestyle fries. We were also served complimentary biscuits and corn muffins.  Biscuits were ok, a little dry but my puppy loved the leftovers.   Corn muffins were not what we were expecting at all, they were quite tasteless and a little too \"cornmealy\".   \"Dumplins\" were delicious and were served in a delicious gravy (I usually hate gravy so this is a pretty big deal).  Hash brown casserole was very good, too rich to finish but it was one of our favorites.   Whole kernel corn was decent after we put some salt on it.   Macaroni and cheese was very rich!  Homestyle fries- fries are fries lol  Sweet baby carrots were amazing. I told my husband the next time we go, I'm just going to order the carrots for my 3 sides.   Country fried shrimp was great, they were served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Very crispy and a good size as well. The hush puppies that were served with them were also very good. They were perfectly cooked.  The spicy grilled catfish was packed with flavor and grilled to perfection. It's easy to overcook fish but this was done perfectly!  Overall, 4/5 for the food! It's definitely a comfort food place. 5/5 for the service! Our waitress, Suki was super sweet and very helpful! We will be back!",

    "text": "I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas since February 2016 - when the Cracker Barrel in St. George alerted me that a Las Vegas location was coming soon. Once it opened, I heard about the long lines and decided to wait until now to check them out.  My friends and I arrived around 5:15 p.m. on a Friday evening and the wait time was minimal (maybe 5 minutes max). The hostess was decent, but I was just thankful to be seated.   Our server seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. While I can appreciate prompt service, I know when someone wants to quickly turn over a table. Regardless, our food came out promptly. We were served warm buttery biscuits, but failed to serve us their famous apple butter on the side. Two of my friends ordered the (cod) fish and chips, which included coleslaw and fries. The portions were enormous! Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak and it included three sides. I had the Old-timers breakfast - 2 eggs, 3 slices of turkey bacon, cheesy grits, and a side of the hashbrown casserole. Their idea of cheesy grits is taking plain grits and throwing some cheddar cheese on top. I mixed it myself and doctored it up with some S&P. The hashbrown casserole was extremely crunchy on top and lukewarm. Once you get past the tough top, it's rather tasty. My egg beaters were supposed to be scrambled hard with cheese, but it resembled a small omelet. My eggs were very bland too.   We were celebrating two of our friend's birthdays and this was the first of my four pals. Their first impression of Cracker Barrel was not positive, but I assured them that this is not how they typically do things at Cracker Barrel.   Before long, we had our checks. Our party of five were in and out in under 60 minutes.  This location is in dire need of some country cooks and good old fashioned Southern hospitality.",

This location I noticed wasn't as crowded as the other locations that I have been to and wasn't as friendly as the other ones either. The waitress was still nice, but didn't seem happy that she wanted to be there.   Their food is always awesome though! I love their chicken 'n' dumplings! Fried apples and fried okra are a great complement to the meal for sides. I also love their baked potatoes but you have to pay extra if you want to get that. With your meal, you get cornbread and buiscuits. Their buscuits are yummy! After your meal, you pay up at the front in the store.   There is plenty of parking and seating inside the restaurant. It is next to Bass Pro Shop off the 15 freeway. As you wait to get seated, you can look around their store. The store has vintage sodas and cool toys and trinkets that you can buy. I would still recommend this place to other people because I love Cracker Barrel and I love that it is always near Bass Pro Shops.",

A few years ago I ate thanksgiving dinner here 2 years straight. I was raised in North Carolina and Cracker Barrel is our food basically.   On this trip, We ate breakfast and was not disappointed. I love the sampler. So much food and under 10 bucks. You get bacon, sausage, ham, hashbrown casserole. Grits, apples, biscuits n gravy and a full stomach. Lol..The coffee and hot Chocolate was great too. My kids had buttermilk pancakes, very good and filling. My wife and I had the sampler. The service was great and we took home apples, apple butter and coffee from the store.  We put our name in the wait list ahead of time and had a 1 minute wait...we drove 4.5 hours and Cracker Barrel was our first stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "I LOVE Cracker Barrel!!  It's still very busy - the best thing I have discovered is their online waitlist. We will join the waitlist before we leave home and only have to wait a few minutes for a table once we get there.   Our favorite day to go is on Sundays when they offer their fried chicken special. I don't know what they are doing to this chicken, but it is amazing!!   The last couple of times we've gone, the service has been questionable, but not bad enough to make me stop going there (yet).   It's always fun the browse the store - they have a great selection of craft sodas and old school candies, as well as a bunch of trinkets and stuff. Does anyone actually buy that stuff?  Anyhow, they offer slings that sit in the chairs to secure your car seat if you need, which is great. My only real complaint is that the tables are all so close together. While I was pregnant, it was hard to be comfortable because my chair would always been slammed against by the person behind me.",

It just amazes me how busy and how much of a wait people will do to get a meal here. It helps to have a gift shop to look at stuff to make the time pass but Southpoint is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away from CB and I know you'll get their food faster.  Luckily, they've opened another location in North Vegas so if you needed to get your CB fix you can travel there if the wait time is too obscene at this location. The Sunday fried chicken special is good and the chicken and dumplings are also good and filling. The hash brown casserole is a must try.   I recommend getting here when they first open otherwise, look to wait a minimum of an hour on the weekends.",

It's not gourmet dining so it's probably best to leave any high expectations at the door.   I had only been to a CB once on the East Coast and was  excited to bring the hubby. We went on a Saturday morning on our way back to Cali so the wait was a good 20 mins.   We both enjoyed our meals, we were definitely full and a bit bloated from all the salt but that's to be expected. My only regret was not getting a frozen apple cider...what's a little diabetes when your sodium level is already through the roof.   I also attached photos for your viewing pleasure...",

They offered biscuits and who doesn't love biscuits.  They appeared to be under cooked but I ate it any way.   Thinking that the batch we got were the on only ones undercooked, we ordered half a dozen for my mother.  Those were undercooked too.  Now I know that I will only go for the breakfast.

My husband said he wasn't too impressed with his mashed potatoes, but loved his raspberry lemonade in a chilled glass and the free refills!

We were excited to come here because there's finally a Cracker Barrel in Vegas.   There was no wait time since it was an early Monday morning. We had no problems with the service until our food arrived. There was a long hair in our biscuits so we notified a server passing by right away. All he could say was, \"Ew, that's nasty!\" and took the plate away. The manager came by to check on us after that but there was no apology from him. Shortly after our food arrived, our waitress, Michaela, gave us our check and that was the last time we saw her. My family and I were waiting on a to-go order that was taking forever. We also wanted drink refills and to-go boxes, but we never received those.   Another waitress told us that she would grab our server, but she still never arrived until the very end with our to-go order. Just because you gave us our check at the start of our meal does not mean that you shouldn't tend to us for the rest of our visit. I believe no one showed up because they were embarrassed about the hair in our biscuits.   Not only did our service end up being horrible, but my family and I felt very sick after our meal. It wasn't just one of us - ALL of us felt ill! Unfortunately this is the last time I will ever visit Cracker Barrel.",

    "text": "We went to the new Cracker Barrel.  It was really busy, but the staff was very organized.  The food was top notch.  I had the Lemon Pepper Trout and it was awesome.  My spouse had fried catfish which was also excellent.  What I like best about this place is the sides.  Between us we had beans, greens, mac-n-cheese, sweet potato, and dumplings.  All of them were great.  This place is brand new so I forgive them for the wait.  They have a few kinks to work out, but for a place that's still having a grand opening it was not bad.  Our 1-3/4 hour wait was really only 1 hour and was worth the wait.  The country store has enough to look at for an hour to kill the time.  I will be back often.  Where else can you get a fish dinner with three sides for $10-$12 ?",

Always brought out piping hot. I do recommend going before 8a if you're an early bird.  I've left at 830am after eating and the patio was full of waiting customers. I do suggest dinner later like after 6p on a Sunday. I went today at 430p table for 1 still waited 45 minutes and felt bad that they sat me at a table for 4.  Seems to be packed with visitors leaving town and North towners coming for dinner.  If you do live on the North FYI another cracker barrel is opening in October off Craig near the in and out burger. In all my fried chicken livers were well seasoned a little hard but crispy, turnip greens good, Mac and cheese a little bland. Waited 30 minutes for my dinner, but the server was great and and Kathy in the country store was a delight to talk to ask we shared stories of Berry picking and farmers markets while I waited for my table. I'll still come back just not for Sunday dinner.",

    "text": "Cracker barrel is amazing...period. Peple are complaining about the wait. It is brand new place. It's going to be busy for the first few months. Solution: Go on a weekday in the morning or for lunch and you won't have to wait. Others are complaining about the mediocre food; Solution: don't get fish at a place that is known for its southern food and its breakfast. I also saw a review about someone not liking the restaurant/country store combo.....umm hello?! It's called Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, the restaurant is just an added bonus. The food is yummy. The service is great (Our server Ashley was awesome and the manager was walking around helping to clear tables and bring people whatever they needed). The store is cute and has one of a kind things you can't find anywhere but Cracker Barrel.",

Also as a side note at the check out they mention a portion of there November sales was going a nonprofit that supports Injured veterans.

I went on a Tuesday around lunch time figuring that it would be slower but boy was I wrong. It was packed but the wait was only 10 -15 minutes no big deal.  Got seated refreshed myself with the menu then waited,  waited, and waited until finally someone came and took our drink order and said the server would be over soon  for our meal order. So then we waited, and waited, and waited like watching grass grow, then someone took our meal order but said our real server would be over soon. The place being packed was a good sign but wow are they under staffed or not prepared. I can't imagine what the place is like on a weekend seriously. The menu options are good on a positive note both breakfast and lunch options available and prices weren't too bad over all. We had to ask for our complimentary corn bread since it never made it to us before . Iced tea was good and little sweat. Meals were good , presentation was good too, but the service just sucked and the girl at checkout where you bring your bill to pay was miserable and rude. Id go back though for the food hoping that they've gotten better with time in the server dept.",

Many visits...then this time, family reunion vacation they could not accommodate us.  13 was too much and we were willing to wait.  Also second time they said someone in wheelchair was a fire hazard because sticking out.  They could seat us at 2 tables but not at same time but still special request.  So it's ironic that my son who works for big company nearby can get a big group seated for meetings?  He won't be back, I won't be back.  Hopefully the new one by us in California will be much nicer.  I'll book my meetings there!  Sorry Cracker Barrel that we love you so much and my family is too big.",

    "text": "Have been to many Cracker Barrel restaurants over the years and this is a HUGE disappointment. Arrived on a Wednesday morning and had a fifteen minute wait. That is pretty good for a Cracker Barrel.  Finally got seated and waitress took drink orders. It took a while for the drinks to get delivered and when they did the waitress said she would be back to take our food order. After a long wait another waitress finally took the order. Not sure if she was covering for the other waitress or vice versa but another long wait ensued for the food. When it finally did come to the table it was the worst Cracker Barrel food I have sever seen. Scrambled eggs were slivers of eggs and the eggs over well I ordered were over medium at best. They were flat and about as thick as a quarter.  I think the oddest thing about the experience is I decided to fill out the online survey - which I normally don't do and it seems like all they wanted to know about is how was the gift shop experience.  A gentleman assisting the servers, (Manager maybe?) seemed to avoid our entire row of tables.  Definitely not like my visits to other locations but based on the other reviews for this location it should be a fair warning.",

I was given a 50 min wait time but I only waited about 40 mins before they called my name. My party of two more wasn't there yet so I asked if I could be bumped down until everyone was there (in Vegas, believe me...this never happens) however because they were awesome they allowed me to notify them when my party arrived and when we were all accounted for we were seated right away. The food was great, exactly how I remember from living in Missouri when I first started going to CB.

I needed some comfort after a tough couple few weeks and I've been looking forward to the grand opening. Six days open and the wait was really long. We got there at 5pm and weren't seated till 6:15pm. I expected a wait but this was a little extreme. Luckily my six year old and I did a little shopping in there country store something we always enjoy. However due to the tremendous wait it was practically shoulder to shoulder in the store. We purchased a few goodies and there was a zero wait for the cashier who were all very pleasant and accommodating. By the time we sat we were hungry. Our server Julian was hands down exceptional. I have been a server for many years in my life and I know how a hectic environment like that can be draining and effect your behavior. However this man was a pro and he had such a wonderful positive demeanor. You knew he was slammed but he made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed for an enjoyable dinner. The food was delicious they did run out of mashed potatoes; but as soon as they were ready Julian hustled them out to me, and they were piping hot and yummy. I made a point to compliment our server to the manager when he came over to check on our table. This is also why I emphasize his name. It is extremely rare especially in Las Vegas to receive such superior customer service from a server at a restaurant of this caliber. The next time we go back I'll definitely ask to sit in his section. We look forward to returning and hope the next time the wait won't exceed an hour but again understandable for it being the first week.",

We went early today around 7am and just made it before the mad Saturday morning rush.  Our waiter, David, was a very nice guy who made sure we had refills and were taken care of.  I ordered the Momma's French Toast breakfast, which was good, although it says topping of your choosing, but you're limited on fruit toppings (blackberry, apple, and peach).    There was an issue when paying, they charged me extra for my meal when the extra charge (Turkey Bacon) was supposed to be included with the meal, but they fixed it for me.   Not sure if they did that because it was busy and just opened, and it was only a few dollars, but I know I was right.  Didn't have a chance to peruse the store area, but it looked like it had all the classics: old school candies, merchandise, everything you'd normally find there.  Overall, it was a good experience.  I'll go back when it's not so busy.",

My breakfast was eggs, hash browns in a cup, grits and over cooked turkey sausage. Biscuits were slightly over cooked with packaged jelly. I waited for my coffee and waited even longer for a refill. Yes ,the service was below average but that could have been the individual server. Ever have breakfast at Egg Works? Now thats a real breakfast.",

    "text": "To be quite honest, I was more impressed with the vintage decor throughout the restaurant than I was with my actual meal. Since the opening of this location last year, my parents have been wanting to bring the family here because it was one of their favorite restaurants when they lived on the East Coast years ago.  Cracker Barrel definitely gives me that mom-and-pop feel. You walk up to the restaurant to find a long porch lined with wooden rocking chairs from beginning to end and as soon as you go through the double doors, you'll find yourself in well, the \"Old Country Store\". There are a lot of novelty items for sale such as sodas in glass bottles and old fashioned candies and snacks that are sure to get the nostalgia flowing. Our wait time for the table was about 15 minutes or less and it went by fast since we were all browsing the gift shop.  The dining area of Cracker Barrel was a lot smaller than I had imagined and the table we were at was a bit close to the party next to us, so it was difficult to get in and out of your chair without bumping into someone. Our server Jeff was very friendly. He took the time to explain the menu to us as well as what specials were being offered. We all ordered a meal from the Fancy Fixin's menu. It came with your choice of any three Country Vegetables N' Sides and two made-from-scratch Buttermilk Biscuits or Corn Muffins.  I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken and chose mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and whole kernel corn. I also opted for one buttermilk biscuit and one corn muffin since I couldn't choose between the two. Our meals came out in a decent amount of time. I looked at my plate and was reminded of those TV dinners that my mom would tell us to nuke in the microwave when she didn't feel like cooking. The chicken fried chicken was nice and crispy. I like that the sausage gravy didn't make it soggy. The portion was huge! I could not finish it. My sides were okay, nothing special. I'm def a fan of the buttermilk biscuits though. Corn muffins were a little salty and didn't really taste like corn bread.  Everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was good and prices were great! We will be back again soon, but for breakfast! If you're looking for a decent, filling, homestyle meal, Cracker Barrel's got you covered.",

My food was served quickly and the atmosphere and country store were similar to other Cracker Barrel's.

This place must be popular because of the hype and the ambiance it offers but we want our money's worth for the food. This may not be a bad choice for breakfast but there are better places to go.",

The corn and broccoli sides were amazing. The fried apples were so good we bought a bottle to take home. Then there is the sweet tea!!! Service was amazing as expected. She brought us extra biscuits while we were waiting for our food. While I was shopping in the attached store (so many awesome things there as well), she brought us more biscuits to take home as well as two sweet teas to go. Definitely will be back when we are in the area. So sorry there isn't one in California.",

I tried the biscuits while I waited on my food they were pretty good. For my meal I had the talapia with corn, mash potatoes, mac and cheese. I know that sounds odd to put together but it tasted really good. Kinda reminded me of blackened catfish but with talapia. Only thing that lacked for me was my party had a couple of refills on their drinks and I only had one drink. I had a soda. Maybe it's because I was drinking dr pepper? I dont know. I even asked the other waitress if I could get a refill she said yes and she forgot. The food and service were good so I would come back in the future.",

As far as making a to go order I highly recommend to call instead of ordering online because apparently they don't even put your order into the system until you go there to pick up your food and they realize that no one has checked their online to go orders. I have literally waited 20-30 minutes on multiple occasions which is disappointing because I live so close. For all that I could have sat down to eat. This last time I went Brooke took great care of me and it was so nice to go there and pick up my food with nothing missing. I will definitely be back I just hope they work on their to go orders",

Food was unseasoned and tasteless.  Diane our waitress had 4 stars on her apron, you would think she would be great, she wasn't!  I don't know why they gave her 4 stars!?!  She had horrible customer service and when we tried to flag her down she acted like she didn't see us!  The table next to us was serviced by Tomi and she was fantastic!  She had her customers needs meet and to think Tomi only had 2 stars?    Someone finally came by so we asked for condiments.  You would think this would of came with our food.  Well every bottle that was brought should of been wiped down before given to another customer!  But guess what...they weren't!  Unfortunately I had sticky fingers from the honey bottle!!!  Management came by to check on us.  I was upset at that time but figured what else could go wrong.  So we just asked him for to-go cups for our drinks.  We were brought out a dirty cup that was splattered with something on the lid and the inside of the cup.   That's when we had to get management involved and told her about ALL our unfortunate experiences at this CB location.  She heard us out but I really don't think anything will happen.",

I mean if overcooked salty ham and rubbery eggs are your thing...kool aid IS a necessity, I suppose.  You're definitely better off overindulging at any strip buffet or cafe, trust me.    Six sentences later, I will get to my point.   This review isn't about the food.  I think everyone should try Cracker Barrel to judge the hype for yourself.   But biscuits and jelly go together like ... well, you know.  Except my biscuit didn't get buttered (literally or figuratively).  Our ham ran off with our missing jelly... and my face looked especially crummy thanks to my cold and the missing napkins.   I could go on, but why bother.  You get the point.   Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  It sets the tone.  You know what kind of day I'm going to be having.",

    "text": "If you like good old fashioned southern food, then Cracker Barrel is the place for you. They have a huge menu, big portions, great prices, friendly service, and tasty food, which is pretty much all the points a restaurant needs to get for a great review in my book.  This was the first time I have been to this Cracker Barrel, and all my other experience with Cracker Barrel's has been in Arizona. It was pretty much exactly like the one I have been to before, with rocking chairs on the patio area (no outdoor dining, just to wait) and a shop full of country style knick-knacks in front of the dining area. They also sell some off brand soda's and candy.  The menu here is one of the biggest I have ever seen at any restaurant, to the point that they even have a huge list of side dishes (well over 20). We had Lisa for our server, and I swear she gave the best menu rundown I have ever heard. She knew everything and could answer any question, and was just one of the friendliest servers we have ever had.  Entrees range from $8 to $12, and they are all southern style. They are known for their chicken and dumplings, chicken fried steak and ham, among other things. I love that they have a dinner sampler, which comes with ham, meatloaf and chicken & dumplings. As a person that loves trying different things, this is a meal for me! The chicken and dumplings is probably the best of the items I named above, as it is juicy and soaked in a delicious gravy. The ham and meatloaf were also very good, though nothing that special.  Most of the dishes come with your choice of two or three sides, which as mentioned above they have a large variety to choose from. Heck, they even have sides you can only get on certain days of the week. I got the fried okra, hash brown casserole, and turnip greens. All the sides taste great and I want to go back and try them all.  In addition, the meals come with corn bread muffins and biscuits. The corn bread is on the savory side, and I prefer sweet corn bread, but if you like it saltier you will probably enjoy it. I love the biscuits and I suggest you get a side of apple butter to go with them.  I've been to Cracker Barrel's before for breakfast, and they do a great job on that to. Just like the huge portions at dinner, their breakfast are big to. They have a breakfast sampler with ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits, grits, hash browns and gravy for around $10. You just cant beat that variety and size for the price. They also have great pancakes and French toast if you have a morning sweet tooth.  My only real criticism here is that some of the food is a little on the bland side for my pallet, but then again I'm one of those people that loves heavily spiced food, so that is largely a personal preference issue. I have also been told that this Cracker Barrel often has large wait times, though we got right in the night we came, and we were a party of five.  The biggest compliment I can give to the Cracker Barrel is that everything here taste home made. It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, who is from Arkansas and knows here southern food. Actually my grandmother was with us when we came here and she loved everything about it.  If you want a large southern style meal that taste like it came out of someone's home kitchen, then bring your appetite and stop by here. I'm not usually big on chain restaurants, but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right. I look forward to coming here for some comfort food again.",

I like the ambiance.  Begins with all the comfortable rocking chairs sitting along the outdoor patio.  Their country store has all kinds of interesting merchandise ranging from hard to find sodas to skin products to home decor and everything in between.     Although most of the food I've eaten at Cracker Barrel has been tasty, I do have a favorite item.  I love their buttermilk pancakes!!  The best anywhere in my humble opinion!  Glad I can have them anytime cause breakfast is available all day!!  Yup, I am a fan!",

Even submitting our name in advance using the online waitlist option we still stood around for 15-20 min after checking in. Don't know what it would have been if we hadn't of done that.   The store was cute and fun to walk around in while we waited, but with little ones you gotta keep an eye out.   Breakfast was delicious. Just got the basic dishes, eggs, meat and apples with pancakes. Coffee was good. No flavored creamer though :-(   Overall not bad, but not how I typically remembered from my first visit to one in Missouri. Worth the wait though!",

    "text": "Decided to stop by Cracker Barrel on my way to Cost Plust Market on Monday midafternoon.  Figured the lunch crowd has left.  Figured wrong as I waited for almost half an hour to get seated.  Half an hour wasted going through and walking aimlessly around the gift shop which looks more and more like a hoarder's living room.   By the time I was seated, the restaurant was already almost half empty but I still waited for a good 10 minutes before a waitress/server took my order.    Strangely, I didn't get the homey ambience I was used to.   None of the usual southern feel.    I went with their meatloaf special that typically comes with 3 sides but...but what do you know, they were out of macaroni and cheese.  Say what?  yes...Cracker Barrel was out of mac and cheese!  So, i opted for fried okra and two servings of turnip greens.   The couple who seated next to me was a bit bummed too!  They ordered the pork chop Monday specials but no mac and cheese (sad face).  Then the server came back and gave me my glass of water and to inform me that she would be serving me 2 biscuits instead of one biscuit and one cornbread because they also ran out of corn bread and it would take 8 to 10 minutes if I wanted a cornbread. Say what - what, now? no Mac and cheese, and now - no corn bread too?    It felt like going to a rib shack only to find out they're out of ribs and only serving sausage links and brisket.  Bummer!  Verdict:  The meatloaf was good but lukewarm and it looked like it shrunk and seemed like I was only served half of the full portion.   The greens were also a tad bit cold and tasted so bland even after dousing it with half a bottle of Louisiana vinegar and ate them with peppers.  Something is wrong with Cracker Barrel today.  Awfully wrong.     It's been a long while since I've visited a Cracker Barrel, the last time was sometime in 2002 when I was stationed in Denver and we would drive 15 miles north to Northglen CO for some home country cookin'.  Those were damn good food though.   The place was practically empty when I left.  With my dining experience today, it might take another 15 plus years before I take another crack at a Cracker Barrel.",

With that said, I started my meal disappointed as my craving wouldn't be satisfied.    Like always though, they serve up a good breakfast.  Ordered pancakes, eggs and bacon.

    "text": "OKAY, So I wish I could write two separate reviews on this place, but I'll just include both experiences here.   The very first time I went Cracker Barrel - amazing experience. The food was good, great portions, cheap prices, and the FOOD itself was satisfying. And to top in all off, we had GREAT service. Our server was extra attentive to our party of 4 (whom are very needy and specific about what they want). The server was very patient and fulfilled our needs. So, after this experience, we were sure that it was worth coming back to. First time visit: 4 stars  After that, I went two more times. The second time, it was not too special, I ordered the chicken tenders. The food did not \"taste bad\", it was just bland. The third time I went, I felt that the food got worse. It was bland, the mashed potatoes had no seasoning, the mac and cheese were too mushy, but the chicken was good. I even ordered the same entree I did on my first experience because I like it so much, but obviously, there seems to be some consistency issues. This experience, I would give it a 1 star, so that's why I just averaged the score to three stars.  For both times, I did NOT like to cornbread. It's dry, crumbly, and had no flavor; the biscuits are better, but taste store-bought anyway.  However, both times, I really like the coleslaw, so that's a plus, because I am very picky with coleslaw. This is my favorite place so far when it comes to coleslaw.  As for the service, can't say anything bad about it, they do an exceptional job. I particularly like the little store on the side, too. It carries a lot of candy and pop that bring back memories of my childhood, with very cheap prices as well.  From this review, I would hope to either improve the food, or better, yet, add some consistency, because I may come back another time, and it be fantastic again, but not sure when that day will be? Does it just depend on the cook? Perhaps. But I don't want to visit on a gamble that it MIGHT be good this time around.",

When the food finally came, it was brought out by someone other than our waitress, which isn't bad. However, one of the orders was wrong and was sent back. It took over 15 minutes to come back corrected. Bad communication amongst the wait staff was the root of the problem. Once we started eating the food was underwhelming. I've been to other locations in different states and this was the worst experience I've had. And the coffee was crap.",

    "text": "This review is strictly based on their breakfast menu. Pretty cool atmosphere. Half of the place is an \"antique\" store with old candies and memorabilia. The other half is a restaurant. You walk in and can smell the fire burning in this huge fireplace. The staff was super friendly and prompt. I had the breakfast sampler, wife had the egg in a basket and the kids had the pancakes and French toast.  The good: the hashbrown cass role is bomb. It's made with cheese, cream of chicken soup, and something else. Whatever it is it's great. The pancakes were delicious partly due to the syrup. It's a combination of real maple syrup and sugar. No fake stuff here folks. The biscuits and gravy was delicious as well. You can tell everything was made from scratch. They have fried apples. It's like eating the apple pie filling without the crust. It was different but good.  The OK: the bacon could've been cooked a little longer. It was a little too flimsy for my taste. The grits were kinda watery. The sausage patty was dry and kinda tasteless.  Overall I'd definitely eat there again because the hashbrown casserole and biscuits are worth it alone.",

Nothing special, but consistently decent throughout the meal. Lots of friendly staff, but our waitress was bad. No personality, I felt rushed to order. Very monotone like she was just not happy to be there. Although it seemed like she was nicer to her other tables. Don't know what we did to put her off. Only refilled our drinks once and that's because her manager said so. He seemed on top of it and he was friendly. Right after we finished our dessert, she looked right at our table and I'm pretty sure she noticed our drinks were empty and she just walked off. Then asked the table behind us if they needed refills. So I think that was the worst part. I did enjoy the peg game tho.",

The chicken was pretty good, and the vegetable side that came with it was also good (carrots).  But I did not like the dressing.  The server was very nice and friendly, but I think they are still a little overwhelmed.  It is still very busy, and maybe they need more staff?  It took quite a while to get the beverages, and then it took a while to get the check afterwards.  Never make people wait to PAY!  Wait time to be seated was only 5 minutes today!",

Ok so this is the third week the store is open and YOU WILL WAIT 1-2 hours and yes ITS HOT AS H E double hockey sticks outside. Put your name in go rock in a chair or shop at Bass and stop complaining about it. Come way before you are STARVING. If you are hungry bring some crackers or celery to chew on while you wait.  The wait did not ruin my mood I expected it. You two tables next and behind me complaining about the wait the whole time I was eating ruined my mood. The hard working waiters don't need to hear about your wait for 25 minutes. Smile. Give them your order and for christs sake the food is cheap, these people make nothing, tip them GOOD!  I watch everything and these tables of two leaving four bucks and tables of four leaving five or six ones. You are ridiculous. You come here to drop your Benjies on a green table you can drop a Jackson on the brown one. And no I DO NOT WORK at a Cracker Barrel. As a matter of fact I have never waited in my life.  OK that is my rant.  The food is AMAZING very accurate Cracker Barrel food. The staff tries very hard and is friendly and attentive. If you want the best get the breakfasts the chicken fried steak or the amazing sampler platter. Sweet tea is awesome and you will be on a sugar high all day. Oh man split some pancakes best you will ever eat, ever.  Buy some goodies for Ma and grandma on your way out and plan on going back to your home/hotel and take a nap after from the carb coma. So good you will think about the good ole days when grandma.",

They have very large portions and their food is reasonable priced, which is another thing that brought us back. Good quality food for a great price.

    "text": "Ahhh Cracker barrel. you know what you might get if you ever get in, so you look online and it says '5-10 minutes' - yeah right, but you put your name in anyway... and wait outside. and wait. and then you approach the outside hostess to inquire about an ETA and the clueless high school kid says 'they've already called for you, go inside and they'll seat you'. So when in the 20+ minutes that we had been sitting there did they call our name? They didnt. the inside hostess, a snide college kid says bluntly that she called us, so we advise her that we've been listening and did not ever hear our groups name, to which she insists that she did and that we will be seated. no clear apology even when both my wife and I couldn't have been more clear that that was all we were really looking for. flat-out refusing to apologize as if she was somehow in-the-right to just not listen to the customer.  we left. I may never feel the urge for a country boy breakfast ever again, and I'm oddly OK with that.  I know it is summer and the workforce shifts to kids who probably think they have better things to do, but no matter how popular a restaurant brand is, you can't ever forget customer service and its importance today. brands ebb and flow in popularity and kne day you may just need this customer again.   also, if you have an online system, it should reflect in near real-time what the wait is or like and tell people it is longer. under-promising and then giving yourself the chance to over-deliver is always appreciated from the customer's perspective.   I know that cracker barrel prides themselves on the old-timey country store, but it just creates a cluttered mess you have to wade through and gives you no good inside waiting option, unless you want to be part of the clutter others are trying to get through to do anything (restrooms are also tucked into this mess)...",

Finally got our food after waiting 45 minutes and this was probably the worse breakfast I've ever ate. We ordered the sunrise sampler and French toast. Were the eggs even real eggs? They tasted like powdered eggs. Bacon had no taste and the ham didn't look appetizing so I gave it to my husband. He tried a little piece of it and said the ham had an odd smell. The only thing that had flavor was the cheesy hash browns.   I honestly thought that it was impossible to mess up breakfast food but this place takes the award for that. Service was poor as well, we ordered a blueberry muffin and a water with lemon and the server didn't bring either of those items.

The service wasn't terrible or anything even though they forgot pieces of our order and didn't refill any drinks, but I even tried to make a joke with the cashier at the end and she just blankly stared at me. So maybe she was just having a bad day. My husband then asked her a question about tip and she cut him off before he even finished his question. Now I'm not the one to start a scene in public, but if I ever come back (which I doubt I will), I might have to if there's a repeat of today.",

Service was great just like the other locations I've been to. Food: much much better than the average diner food. Just don't eat the dumplings! ;-) too doughy!",

I make these at home. Just a suggestion... make the hole in the bread smaller and the eggs won't overcook, but the bread will get toasted nicely. The waitress noticed and offered to have it remade, but I declined since it took a while to get the food in the first place. The sausage patties were dry and after one bite I offered them to my husband. The taste was not appetizing at all. My husband ordered the Sunrise breakfast. He enjoyed the breakfast but there were some egg shells in his eggs.   Our server was Leah. She, along with everyone else we encountered in the store and restaurant were very welcoming. I don't know when we will be back. Some of the prices weren't any more competitive than some of the mom and pop places we frequent for breakfast.",

Lol 5 minutes later she brings it out. My eggs was cooked hard done when I asked for over easy, the biscuits was undercooked, and the server by the name of Mickey was absolutely a disaster. She didn't offer to remake the dish or anything. Never refilled my coffee. Just terrible at the job.  Kind of a let down bc the cracker barrel back in home in Mississippi is great.

My girlfriend has never been and I wanted to show her why I loved this place so much...but to my dismay I was disappointed and embarrassed that I raved so highly about this place.  Parking lot isn't bad, upon entrance you have the segmented parking for the restaurant and of course the vast parking lot from the casino. It's good though. We came around 830am, we knew it would be busy and may have had to wait. We only waited a couple minutes. It was busy.   Walking into the dining area, it's cramped, but decent. They should've expanded it just a tad, or add outdoor seating it's perfect during the fall and spring months. Anyways, our drink order was taken, then a few moments later our breakfast order. My girlfriend and I ordered Grandpas Country Breakfast. About 10 mins later our food was brought out by this rude server she was skinny, tall and platinum blonde short hair...she threw our plates at us. Literally didn't say anything, just threw the plates in front of us and left, didn't bring our Apple butter or ask if everything looked right which my girlfriend got the wrong meal.  Luckily we had a server in training who came by to check on us and noticed that my girlfriend had received the wrong meal and went to change it immediately.   Getting a refill on my coffee was nearly impossible, no one ever came around. And my eggs were undercooked for an over easy egg.   Of course we will try this place again, I want to be able to give it 5 stars instead of 3, but the 3 is for the chicken fried chicken.",

Jamil has a friendly and positive attitude and I watched as he took excellent care of each and every customer he served. I had a country breakfast and it was delicious and very reasonable price. The hot fudge sundaes are excellent and very low price $3.99 and served in a frozen mug. More than five stars for Jamil and Cracker Barrel. We will be back!",

As soon as I enter the gift shop it immediately takes me back to being there with my family as a 10 year old.   Classic American/southern breakfast that will leave you feeling full and satisfied! Although I think their sausage gravy could use a little work. You don't really get any pepper or sausage flavor, it just kind of just tastes like salt. Scrambled eggs are great, bacon is great, pancakes are awesome!  I grew up in Arizona where Cracker Barrels are abundant but Las Vegans are pretty dang excited about getting one! Definitely worth stopping by for breakfast every now and then.",

Girlfriend and I both had the chicken dumpling with the aide of fries and okra. Sadly to say everything was bland. The corn bread was hard and dry...my daughter wasn't impressed my her shrimp and dumplings either and my 1 year old was hitting the dining table with her corn bread. Oh my.  It was a let down but maybe it was the cook. I'll it try again next time with my husband, he's from the East Coast and my critic of this place pissed him off.",

Reason why she impressed me so much was her service she is amazing, she had friendly attitude as well as quality service with up keeping with our needs. My favorite quality about her most of all is that she is not fake! Her personality is amazing and caring and she didnt need to just fake a smile ( like other servers do) to show it.

A nice touch was the golf tee game on the table which kept my mind busy as I waited for my food.   On the down side the service was mediocre, the wait was ridiculous, the biscuits I had heard which were flaky and homemade were dry, the grits needed more flavor and salt, and lastly portions left me hungry.

I on the other hand had my fair share of Cracker Barrel when I used to be the road warrior crossing country. I never really loved the place but for my love I shall eat here one more time.  We arrived around dinner time. The wait wasn't long but we messed around on the rocking chair and browsed the store a little before getting seated.  The menu had a wide range of selections. Breakfast menu was also available even during the evenings. I had my eyes on 10oz ribeye steak, and slave girl got Friday fish fry.   The fish fry came with 4 pieces of batter fried cod filets, fries and cole slaw. Slave girl told me the fish was dry and she really didn't enjoy it.  My ribeye came with 3 sides. I know my sides didn't make sense, but I got cheese grits, mashed potato, and steamed broccoli. I asked my steak to be cooked at medium rare but it came out well done. The server didn't have any issues and took it back to the kitchen. The second one was more rare, but there was no point for me kept sending the food back so I settled with the rare steak. The flavor was good but meat quality was not impressive.   The service was strange... When we got there, we had multiple people coming to order our drinks. The real server we got was not bad but she wouldn't take our empty cups away and kept bringing new cups to the table. Eventually we ran out of room on our table and no one wanted to come take things away from the table.   Love yourself and don't go there?",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel what happened?  We have always enjoyed stopping at Cracker Barrel when we travel.  This experience was so disappointing.  First of all the portions were ridiculously small. My husband ordered 2 fried eggs and grits. Somehow they managed to serve him less than 2 eggs and 4 tablespoons of grits in a tiny bowl. We are not big eaters but this was ridiculous! To top it off when he drank half his coffee he could see something stuck to the inside of the coffee cup.  They still charged us $2.49 for the coffee. I gave them a 2star rating because the fried apples were delicious.",

They have the best prices as well, & they have a great kid menu  very fast customer service, you can check in on the waiting list online on their webpage but it is an \"estimated time\" so don't expect to be seated right away. But the servers are all so sweet. My favorite is the \"grandmas samplers\" it comes with Pancakes served with a warm bottle of 100% Pure Natural Syrup, two eggs*, one strip of Thick-Sliced Bacon, one Smoked Sausage Patty, and a sampling of Sugar Cured or Country Ham. Comes with Hashbrown Casserole or Fried Apples. Portions are small & pancakes are thin, so this is a perfect way to sample their specialties!",

I waited a while for the crowds to die down before coming to eat here. My Mom had never been before so we decided to take her on Saturday. What I could not believe was that we walked in with no line and were promptly sat at a table. Bingo!   The menu is big and there is a lot to choose from. The featured food is southern cooking. I chose the special of the day which was chicken and rice served with a delicious chicken gravy and green beans, my hubby chose chicken and dumplings, and Mom chose the chicken cutlets with fried ochra and fried apples. They bring over some tasty biscuits and cornbread muffins to chew on while you wait for your food. They have a really yummy homemade lemonade which one cannot get enough of. It has a nice tart finish and I consumed multiple glasses of it. Everyone enjoyed their meal and of course saved room for some peach cobbler and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent but the cobbler was perfect!   We had really excellent service from Bridgett who provided for all of our needs. All the staff seem to be happy working there and were very kind especially the staff working in the attached gift shop. Oh yeah, this little general store is fun to walk through where it features hard to find classic candy and soda pop! Out on the patio, there are some lovely rocking chairs for purchase and they come in all kinds of colors. The porch was decorated for the Memorial Day weekend so all kinds of red, white and blue was everywhere. Good times!",

She agreed! However, there was a couple in Vegas so we went to the one in Vegas on our way home. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately. It's a really cute place. We were given the menu and we look through it. My friend got the egg sandwich and added biscuits and gravy that comes with a side of bacon. The server suggested their sunrise plate that has a little of everything. I decided to get that. It came with 2 eggs cooked however you want, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, a piece of ham, hash browns and all their fixins' which includes, 2 biscuit and gravy, fried apple, and grits.   My friend said her sandwich was good. It was a pretty basic sandwich. She added her bacon into it.   My plate was blah. The eggs were fine obviously. I ordered it over medium. The sausage had a good flavor but, so dry. The bacon was good. It was nice and crispy. That's how I like my bacon. The sausage had a weird smell and it was really salty. I love salty but, this was a lot. The hash browns had a weird flavor. There was onions in it. I love onions but, it was odd. The grits were blah. I added salt and butter but, nope I couldn't do it. The biscuits were good but, the gravy lacked flavor. I added salt and pepper to it. The fried apple was a no go for me. It was too sweet. I didn't like the texture.   Overall, the place is cute. The service is awesome. The food is better at Denny's. Lol I can say I tried it but, I will not return.",

It lacks the friendly southern hospitality that I've received at every other location I have visited and the food quality is just not up to par . I stayed away for a long time hoping today would be the visit that had me wanting to become a regular customer again And it just wasn't . I've ordered the sampler for years . Any other location it's always hot and the sides are served in side dishes . Here I receive 5 items thrown on a plate all touching each other , it's never hot , and it's just not Cracker Barrel quality . Sent it back and the second time around with the sides in actual side dishes it was much more enjoyable and not soggy. Called a manager over to request more iced tea and never received it . I will drive to Kingman or St. George like I used to do if I feel the need for Cracker Barrel ever again.",

While I'm a fan of Cracker Barrel, I want you to know that you're not going to get some amazing food here that'll blow your mind or knock your socks off. It's just affordable decent good 'ol American food! It's one of the few places this far West where you can get some decent grits! If you come here with a snooty attitude, then there's a good chance that you'll be disappointed. The place will most likely be packed as with most Cracker Barrels, so there will be a line to get a table. After putting in your name, you can pass time by perusing their souvenirs in the gift shop.  On my most recent visit, I started things off with coffee since I had just driven in from California. If this is your first stop after a long drive, the restrooms are just to the right of the cashiers when you enter the store. For my meal, I ordered their Sunrise Sampler because I couldn't decide on what to get.  *Sunrise Sampler* It came with pretty much everything... two eggs served with grits, fried apples, hash brown, bacon, smoked sausage, ham, and buttermilk biscuits & gravy. I didn't care too much for the fried apples, but everything else was good for a hearty breakfast especially with a long day ahead of me involving lots of exercise!  The service was great. The place was slammed and my server was trying to get to every one of her tables as fast as humanly possible. She always came by with more coffee and a smile. It was nice to see that other servers were covering for each other. I had to start refusing refills after a while! When you're finished with your meal, just take your check and pay at one of the cashiers.",

Lo and behold got called after.  Whoa, the place were packed,and so I thought they must have a good breakfast.  While we were waiting for the waitress/waiter, my eyes were rolling and seeing those decors on the wall. Whoa, soooo much decors. The ambience is nice and clean. Staffs were nice and presentable. Very attentive but they don't really good in looking what you've ordered. Plus, food was bland although condiments are available at the side. I ordered a over well eggs however they served me an over easy which my friend ordered that. So we had to switched our eggs of course. Coffee wasn't taste good, can't really taste the coffee:( .

The little gift store was entertaining and the rocking chairs outside was nice to sit on and relax while waiting.  Once we were called in for our table we had terrible service.  Without writing a full paragraph i'm going to summarize it.  Our server kept disappearing for long periods of time.  Every table that our server had was not getting any of the food brought to our tables.  All the tables around us that were seated 10 mins or more was able to get their drinks, food, and then bill and was out the door before we had any food brought to our table.  When the food was finally brought to our table it was only half.  My fiance only had half of what she ordered and the server said she will bring the other half when its ready.  My food came out after my fiance ate her half plate.  Then once i was finished the server brought her other half of the plate.  Getting a refill on the drinks never took place because the server never came back.  When it was time for the bill we just went up to the counter to find our check since our server was gone once again.  Plus all the food we had delivered to our table was cold.  I wasn't going to write a bad review on here but when i contacted cracker barrel on their website they never contacted me back.  I would give 1 star, but the gift shop staff was very friendly.  I will never come back to this place again",

My husband and I were out with a few co-workers yesterday (April 16th 2017) and decided to treat them to lunch. I checked in online for 6 people and saw there was an hour wait, which seemed reasonable considering it was Easter Sunday. On our way to the store we had one additional person agree to go, so when I got there the girl added the other person to the waitlist for us. She told us there would be a 50 minute to 1 hour wait which is what we were expecting. We went to the gift shop, bought some drinks and snacks then headed outside and sat on the porch to wait. After an hour I went back inside to check on our status and the girl told us it would be an additional hour + wait. Mind you, I am here with friends and have bragged about this place to no end. When I asked her why we had to wait another hour she said it was because the size of our party and they could not accommodate us. Meanwhile, there are plenty of smaller parties of 4 - 6 being called over and over. The staff basically told us too bad, just wait. After hearing of the additional wait time a couple of people from our party said they couldn't wait the extra time so we all went our separate ways. This was extremely disappointing. I'm pretty sure after this my friends won't be back and I'm not sure I'll be going back either.   I am giving 3 stars because normally I love this place. The food is awesome in my opinion and the staff is usually great. Maybe they just don't do well under pressure.",

Over used bathrooms need heavy cleaning so your nostrils get to pay the price.   Service... forget it.  Pancakes came out cold. The only thing hot about breakfast was the syrup.  The edges of the pancakes were over done and crispy and the butter melted eons ago from sitting waiting for our waiter to summons them.  I asked for a fork. Yeah, I'm home now. Never got one.  I could have drove home and got my own fork drove back and it would have been quicker.  All the servers there look over worked and confused. My server looked like he wanted to kill someone. Thats the look he had on his face. The tables are smashed together.  Way more over crowded than any Cracker Barrel I've ever been to.  I'll continue to visit Cracker Barrel out of town.

    "text": "Completely overrated! Went this morning, for the first time. My friends have been raving about Cracker Barrel, for years, in the states that they live in. Worst chicken fried steak, I've ever had. Potatoes were stuck together, and hard. The runner rolled her eyes when I asked for ketchup, Chalula, napkins, and pepper, but there was nothing on the table to dress your meal. The meal was lukewarm, and forgettable. The server was nice, and the store was cute, but unfortunately, didn't live up to the hype.",

After waiting at least 45 min for our meal the waitress comes to our table and said it was taking long because it was a new item that came out 4 days ago. I asked her if they train their workers, I could go back and show them how to put an egg on top of a piece of chicken and an English muffin. When it did finally came out it was the wrong order. I decided just to go eat somewhere else but asked to talk to the manager. That was like talking to a wall. She didn't seem to care at all. It really showed in the operations of the restaurant.",

The food came very quickly. I chose the sampler (ham, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings) with three side dishes. The portions were good. The biscuit was delicious! I liked the ham the best.  It was perfect, and the chicken and dumplings were good as well.  My husband ordered the meatloaf which was just ok. All the sides (corn, baked apples and mashed potato's) were good. The atmosphere was pleasant enough but loud. It would have been too loud for me if the restaurant were full.  Problem is both of us were sick that night and the only thing in common was the meatloaf.  If We hadn't gotten ill I would have given it five stars.  We will probably go again as there are other things I'd like to try.  Hopefully they'll open one on the northwest side of town.  The price was approx $15 per person.",

Mostly bland food and grilled chicken tenders drier than my grandmother's teeth! Some of the heavily carb laden foods which includes the biscuits are pretty good but I find the food taste, temperature and texture to be inconsistent. So to wrap up- if you're practicing your piggy moves then I'd go but if you're trying to cut back then I'd so skip this place! And avoid the grilled chicken tenders!",

Keeping in mind just like any establishment there will be some people that love it and some people that hate it. This is a chain restaurant, so everything is fairly the same at anyone you visit. I have never been to a Cracker Barrel and have not had to wait, that is the common knowledge of coming to a place like this. I personally checked in online and when I arrived they said it would be about 5 minutes. If you don't want to wait I would suggest doing so and going in prepared.   The entire staff was very friendly and very accommodating. The manager I noticed was walking around and checking in with all tables, which in my eyes is amazing customer service! Keep it up!   I ordered the Sunday special which was 2 chicken Breast with a deep fried batter and 2 sides. It was very good, and for the price point for the portion size, I was very impressed!   I will defiantly be back to eat another time!",

That being said I have no other Cracker Barrel to compare it to but, have always heard rave reviews about the restaurant and food.   My first visit was fabulous! The place was packed but the staff was efficient in turning tables and getting people in and out without feeling rushed.  The food was good and service was great. Food and drinks were served promptly. The quality overall was better then your average popular breakfast chain.   The only bummer is I have been back a handful of times and the restaurant/ kitchen itself is pretty inconsistent. I've gone a time or two and the food is great and another time or two and the food is sub par I've even been served cold, soggy food.   One thing that is consistent is the service I have always enjoyed all the wait staff, they are friendly, accommodating and quick! I also always enjoy browsing their \"country store\" so many old timey candies, nic-nacs, cookware, toys, hats clothing...   If the kitchen can be more consistent this place would sure be a home run.  I will continue to try Cracker Barrel in hopes that it improves, I know it's a fairly new establishment and maybe they are just working out the kinks.",

    "text": "We all got gift cards to Cracker Barrel for Christmas so the next time we were all together the family could go to dinner as we did tonight. Our first visit to this restaurant started out smooth enough. I arrived first and put in my name for a table for five. There was no line then. About 10 minutes later the rest of them pulled to the door and we stood in line waiting to be seated. We were taken to the back about 5 minutes after we got to the host station.  Having never been to Cracker Barrel before, we all took several minutes to look over the menu. We ordered iced tea all around and continued to decode what to order. When our drinks came out, my step mom, my dad and my aunt were given theirs first. As our waitress came around to my grandma the drinks fell and Grandma took a bath. Top to bottom she was pretty well soaked. The waitress apologized and very quickly brought a few towels to mop up the floor, table and chair. She also patted down my Grandma a little bit. She had already taken off the wet jacket but her pants, which were also wet, stayed on leaving poor Grandma wet and cold. Her meal was comped later after my aunt raised a little hell over the accident. We placed our food order shortly after the excitement had died down.  I ordered a Cracker Barrel Sampler. This comes with chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ham with three sides. I ordered turnip greens, green beans and hash brown caserole. Meals also come with a choice of bread. I got both corn bread and a biscuit so I could try it all. The chicken and dumplings tasted good but I was disappointed that there was just one small piece of chicken. And the dumplings were like giant noodles. Not what I am used to but more traditional or so I am told. The meatloaf was a little bit spicy and very moist. I am probably in the minority here but I prefer a dried meatloaf with a nice crust. This was good though. The ham was just a small piece and very salty. Nothing more to say on that. The green beans were not at all exciting. I can tell they are canned beans and rather mushy. The turnip greens were good. Kind of like spinach but more grassy. They had nice shredded bits of pork mixed in. And the hash brown casserole was the best thing on my plate. Cheesey potato goodness. They only thing that could make that better would be a little more of a crust on top.   The corn bread was just not good. It was dry, dense and over cooked. Some of the muffins were almost as dark and the rocking chairs out front. The biscuit, on the other hand, was good. Soft, warm and fresh. I'd stick with that for a bread option.   The house salads my family ordered looked good but it was discouraging to see some of the dressings came in individual packs like you see at fast food restaurants. In fact, I recognized the Mezetti packaging from fast food. I'm not saying Cracker Barrel should make their own dressing in house but do they really need to bring you dressing packets?  My step mom and grandma both ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak. Both ordered it medium-well. My grandma even said she didn't want to see any blood. The two steaks were done completely different. My step moms was medium-well. My grandmas was more medium and even close to medium-rare. There was blood. She still ate about half.  We also passed around a couple of orders of fried apples tonight. They remind me of the apple dessert I used to get in frozen dinners. Only this was more fresh. I suppose these were pretty good apples but they were very sweet. I would pass on them were I to go back.  A few final notes, I like the store. There are a lot of country goods in there. And some old fashioned candies and sodas. The restaurant decor is cool. I love seeing the antiques. There is a sign in there I would love to have in my garage. Too bad its not for sale.   This place is OK but I'm not a huge fan. I wish the food was better than average. And I wish it was served warmer than we had it. I will be back again mostly because there is money left on that gift card from Christmas. But Cracker Barrel is not one of those places that I will be at often.",

Today we did the online checkin and low and behold still another hour wait.  Just a horrible way to run a business.

As other reviewers have stated I keep hoping they will \"get their kinks out\"... RUDE waitresses sub par food.   Last week my Dad came to town and we came again. I ordered a med. steak and it came VERY well done. the waitresses had been short with us so we decided to wave down the manger. He came over i told him what was wroung and he responded \"so you want another steak?\" Um yes...about 20 mins later the 2nd well done steak came out. When he came back over I had not touched it and he said \"looks like a perfect Cracker Barrel Medium\" Um Medium is a temperature not a style of cooking. He then walked awak.   Now being tip time the waitress came over and was super nice and said she would take it off the check. I have NEVER had a manager argue with me like this. It was embarrassing and unprofessional.",

There was no line so I had no wait.  Got to my table pretty quickly and put in my order relatively fast.  It seemed to take a bit longer than expected to get my food.  When it did arrive the girl forgot to bring out my biscuits.  I asked her to go get them for me.  Then she entered a wormhole and I didn't see her for quite some time. I finally was able to flag down another waitress and she brought out my bread (I was done with most of my meal by then).  A few minutes later the wormhole spit out the original waitress who low and behold had my bread.  Her statement \"Oh, you got your bread already.\"  Yeah, no thanks to you.    I told the folks there to read their Yelp reviews.  This is the second-worst Cracker Barrel I've ever been to (the worst was Massachusetts, near the border with Connecticut).  Not happy.",

    "text": "By far the WORST experience we have ever had at a Cracker Barrel. I personally was introduced to Cracker Barrel two years ago, but my husband has been eating at them for years and years. His mom and him LOVE it because they are from Texas and always say they can count on good southern cooking. Unfortunately this visit was not the case. It started with my husbands silverware being dirty, we went through three different sets.   When our food arrived we were shocked. My husband and I ordered the same meal, the chicken and dumplings plate. I honestly should have taken a picture but I was more caught up in dealing with the situation. When our meals arrived my husbands plate had literally half the amount of chicken and dumplings on it than mine did. Extremely confused we showed our waitress who quickly went to the kitchen to get more. You could tell she did everything she could to help, but the silverware was a dishwashers issue and the food was clearly the cooks.   The times I have been to Cracker Barrel with my husband I always eat breakfast. Wanting to try something new he swore by the chicken and dumplings as this is his go to dish. After getting clean silverware and the correct portion, we started eating. After a few bites (and asking for hot sauce) he asked me what I thought of if. I was honest and said it was the most bland thing I had ever eaten and was confused why he liked it so much. The look said it all. He was just as upset. He said it had never tasted like this and was thrown off by the whole experience.   For the next 10-20 minutes we were continuously asked if we were done eating as it was clear they were wanting to rush people. This was done by bussers and other wait staff not our waitress.   Finally we finish our meal and go pay. We're asked how our meal was and we say \"not so good for xyz reasons\". The response?   \"Your total is 43.18\"  Wow. Thanks but no thanks. Spend your money elsewhere!!!   3/7 update... after no one at this location contacted me I decided to reach out to corporate. They don't seem to care either. In which case I won't be doing business here ever again.",

My biggest concern with them though is how cheap the food tasted, like nothing there was made by hand. It all tasted either store bought or frozen and pre-cooked, like they just reheated the food.

There was a long wait, you go pass all these clothes to a small eating area. Country store or restaurant? Pick a struggle.   My food was mediocre: fish, mashed potatoes, green beans, and fried okra. The best thing on the plate was the green beans. Service was decent although our server was training a newbie and the poor thing spilled water on the two people sitting on the end of the table. Very loud unable to have a conversation or hear the people at your own table.   Paid at the register and saw Bit 'O Honey candy hence the three stars.

The food - well, it was probably the worst that we've had in quite some time.  Eggs were overcooked, Hashbrown casserole was undercooked but the top was dried out and hard.  Biscuits were undercooked and kind of gooey, and the sawmill gravy tasted like it was just made from a mix.   if our choice is going to this location again or driving 2 hours or more to get to another one, looks like we are going on a road trip to either AZ or UT.",

The breasts were too large for me to eat the whole meal, & I ended up taking 1/2 of everything home for round two! The coating on the fried chicken is delicious and has a little bit of a spicy kick to it, which I can't describe from what. I love the cornbread muffins here! This place was worth the wait. I suggest you put your name in two hours ahead of time before you want to eat. Then go shopping at Bass or the Premium Outlet stores and come back when your wait time is up. We were told two hours, came back & were seated in 5 minutes. Stick with the chicken finger dinner for the little kids. If it doesn't look like a chicken finger, they probably won't eat the delicious fried chicken and you will waste your money! The chicken fingers are good. My 9 year old ate them with a side of fries. He also had left overs for later. I only wish that locals could call in reservations instead of driving down there! I think management should consider this. They could also take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready.",

Given a 35 minute wait estimate, after an hour we left without service. See below:  Arrival..... Host: name please? Me: Paula Host: Colin? Me: no, Paula  Host: what? Me: P a u l a T.  Host: ok, there's a 35 minute wait. Me: ok, thank you.   After all that, and spelling my name for him, somehow my name was added to their app/list as Paul T.   Ok, close enough.   We browse through the shop area and hear Megan call out, \"table is being prepared for Paul T.\"  I head over to her podium. She doesn't ask my name but quickly tells me to stand to the side because it'll still be about approx 10 minutes.  Ok, no worries. I understand as I've also worked in restaurants.   Waiting, waiting, waiting. Others who checked in after us are being seated.  Ok, More waiting. I ask her to check on my name, Paula T. or Paul T.  She's too busy looking @ the new tattoo and putting creme on it.  She finally says, \"your table isn't ready yet\". Okay, I ask her to at least check for my name clarification. She didn't.  She's very busy, but telling customers that this is slow compared to most Sunday mornings so it's no big deal. She's used to it.  I approach again to inquire about name clarification because it's been almost an hour at this point.   She says, \"oh table for Lupe\"?  No, Paula T. or Paul T. because my name wasn't properly input by the first host outside at the front door. I'm trying to explain to her. She insisted my name must be Lupe because there is no Paula or Paul on her tablet.   Wait a minute, you called Paul T about 30m ago so......????  At this point she was looking but says nobody named Paul or Paula has checked in. I remind her that she called it about 30m ago.  If she'd have listened to me, I could have explained it.    Cutting off customers as they speak is highly inappropriate. Customer service 101.   Besides the name mix up she should have at least acknowledged that my husband and I both had been standing in her area for a long time.   A good hostess would pick up on that, not Megan though.  Her new tattoo was the most important thing for her.   Left without service.  Won't be back.  CB manager, please retrain Megan.   P.s., I have nothing against tattoos.  I think they're great.",

We did decided to wait a little bit before visiting allowing them to work out the \"kinks\" associated with opening a new restaurant. This seemed to be the right idea as many who have dined at the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas were unhappy the location didn't live up to the Brand's renowned country-style food and service.  After our visit, I can assure everyone they are working the issues out and are beginning to resemble to comfortable, easy eatery and general store I remember from childhood.  We actually attempted to stop by Cracker Barrel a week prior, but left after being quoted over a 2 hour wait! Granted, it was a Sunday morning, but 2 hours later would have been lunch time. This time around, our wait time was quoted at 40 minutes (which was almost exact). It was a chill day, so we waited. All of the signature rocking chairs on the porch were taken, but they had a nice shade and mister system and you could browse the general store. When our name was called we proceeded to the desk to be seated.  The restaurant was very busy. There was a lot of staff including corporate trainers to ensure everyone was adhering to the company's standards. Our server was on the slow side, but not horrible. I ordered my favorite biscuits and sawmill gravy with their delicious smoked sausage patties and fried apples (also asked for some amazing apple butter for one of my biscuits).   Everything was as expected, other than the coffee which wasn't the best.   Until there are a couple more locations built in the valley, this one is going to be very busy most of the time. Although we will be back, it will most likely be on days where we have the time to wait the long list for a table.",

Granted this location JUST opened up, it still had some major problems that I don't understand, like the to go orders.  We came for breakfast and were told the wait was 1.5 hours. We put our name down around noon and I shopped till I was about to drop, but then they called our name. Awesome.   We sit down and order with our waiter, Bob. Bob was great. Food was fair. Most was room temp., and nothing came out nice and hot and fresh. Kid's fries were disgusting and ice cold and not fresh and broken in half. Sent those nasties back. Bob was even appalled. Everything else was ok.   Bought up half of the baby section of the store, paid the bill and went on our way.   Several hours later, sent my hubs to pick up a to go order that consisted of meatloaf, a chicken salad and two kids meals and it took him longer for the to go order than it did that morning for us to eat breakfast. Epic fail. So not happy.   Plus, their merch. prices seem higher than Arizona. They had nothing on sale because they just opened, but I don't remember nearly every single baby outfit being $25 and most of the adult outfits being $40+. I sill bought more than I should have, but I wasn't as happy with the food or prices as I remember being every other time we have went to a CB.",

He was the most attentive  efficient, friendly, hard working waiter i have ever had in my 30yrs if dining out. The food was very very  good. Corn muffins and biscuits  were warm and delicious, meatloaf was tender and flavorful, greens perfectly cooked and seasoned, mac n cheese, yummolicious,  chicken n dumplings moist and creamy and tender. Country fried steak was thick n juicy. Greaaat overall experience, excellent location, just outside of the Vegas strip, sourh. A must stop before the drive to LA. The nostalgia gift store, is great for last minute souveniers and fun snacks or gifts.",

After being seated our waiter had great customer service but the actual service was bad. The waiter forgot our drinks, we asked for Tabasco and it was never brought, and our food still came out messed up. The manager was nice enough to take some expense off our bill and even brought us some extra biscuits. The food was very good. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. Overall I would have to say 2 stars is adequate enough to rate my experience here.",

The complimentary biscuits & cornbread aren't good. Not sure why they're never fresh but I've given them a try each time I'm there and I don't go in for a second bite.   The food is definitely considered comfort food and my favorite dish is no longer available which was the chicken bake. Why does nothing great ever last?!?  The chicken was juicy and cooked just right. I've had their mashed potatoes, green beans, fried apples, corn, mac & cheese, baby carrots and dumplins. Most items need salt & pepper.   I do enjoy their sweet tea and crazy Coca Cola fudge cake!   I think the food can use some tweaking and please bring back the chicken bake!!!",

And everything was bland as all heck, except for the hash brown casserole, which tasted like it was boiled in onion juice.

Over all an amazing meal and half of it came home with me. The reason for my four stars is my server wasn't very attentive and would run off as soon as she came to the table. She was friendly but rushed. I'll put the blame on it's Saturday morning and they should've had more servers. I'll def be back to try it again!",

The wait wasn't too bad when we arrived, fairly early around 8 am on Sunday. I did find out that there is the option to join the waitlist online via their website, which would be a good choice during peak dining hours.  I ordered Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast because I really wanted to try the country fried steak (although I opted for country fried chicken). It came with 2 eggs with grits, choice of fried apples or hashbrown casserole (I got the hashbrown casserole), and biscuits and gravy. The country fried chicken was okay. I wasn't a huge fan of the breading or the gravy, and the biscuits weren't anything special either. The other sides were good and I liked the grits.   We ordered the kids' buttermilk pancakes for my son which turned out to be the star of the meal. They are crisp on the edges and tender in the middle, with great flavor. We had to ask for syrup, and the biscuits didn't come with butter or jam -- maybe you're supposed to eat them with the gravy?  The food was okay and service could have been better, but overall it was a decent first Cracker Barrel experience and I would go back for the pancakes. We bought a box of pancake mix at the attached Old Country Store (which is also where you pay your bill) to take home!",

BUT this particular one is really terrible!  The manager is clueless.  We went for breakfast last weekend and they seated us at a table of their choosing then proceeded to loudly move tables around the wood floor so that they were screeching all around us, all while sweeping incessantly and even cleaning the woodwork almost right under our feet.  And this was organized by the manager!  We definitely felt like we were in their way.    The food was badly presented...not at all appealing.  The french toast was barely cooked and still very yellow from the eggs, not browned at all, not sliced, no powdered sugar, no butter - just plain and plopped on the plate.   We asked why we didn't get powdered sugar and they said they don't serve it that way.  No apologies.  The server spilled coffee all over our table and said he was going to get napkins but promptly forgot and started waiting on the table next to us and never came back!  Also don't bother asking for well done bacon because you get what you get, period.",

The manager gave us nothing but excuses and the poor group next to us the busboy dumped an entire glass of ice tea down the front of him and the manager never showed up to apologize. The overall atmosphere felt depressing and it was like none of the employees even cared about their job or the customers.

    "text": "Decided to check out this Cracker Barrel because we were on this side of town after an event. I have had good experiences at their Craig location so I was excited because we were hungry! There wasn't a wait which was good because I was anticipating one it being a Saturday evening and all. No appetizers this time but we ordered the Signature Burger ($8.99), the Country Fried Steak ($12.4)9, the Meatloaf (10.99), and the Country Fried Shrimp for me ($11.49).       While we waited for our food our very nice waitress brought us out some biscuits and corn bread muffins. The corn bread was delicious but we had to bring it to the managers attention (he happened to be walking by and asked us), that the biscuits were very underdone. So much so that the center was gooey. He replaced them with new ones and they were fine.      My friend, as a one of his sides, ordered a side salad so that came out first. More than a couple pieces of the lettuce were dark and beginning to rot. Then we received our dinners to which I grabbed the dish the butter had come in for the biscuits and muffins to scoop out my side of macaroni and cheese to give to my boyfriend- hey, I'm nice. I then went to eat some of my mashed potatoes and I found a black hair. It was right under the mashed potatoes on the side so it could have been from the macaroni or the potatoes. We brought it the managers attention and he replaced my meal and took the meal off the bill. Which was nice because I wasn't asking for that. But at this point I lost my appetite and had to take the food to go. Which was so unfortunate because it's seafood so it never tastes the same as it does fresh.      I asked everyone else how their meals were and I got the following feedback -The burger was fine, it was just generic and the fries were bland. -The country fried steak was good and it had a nice crunch. -The meatloaf was bland and not very good.      Overall, our waitress and the manager were great. The kitchen I would say at this location is seriously lacking. Rotting lettuce, hair in the food and bland meals isn't going to have me return to this location. I'll stick to the one on my side of town.",

The service from Elijah was by far the worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. He needs an attitude adjustment and some additional training on how to properly do his job. Half of the orders came out wrong and our wonderful  server was annoyed when we would let him know. When the check came out we reminded him that we had asked for it to be split, he walks away and comes back with an attitude to let us know he can not split it, that we can do it at the register and proceeded to crumble the receipt.",

This was by far the worst customer service my family and I ever had, there were no silverware served to our table nor the complimentary bread and butter. After over half an hour of waiting to get our order taken we asked for our bread which took another 20 mins. It came out burned. And hard and FUCKING COLD. We were so confused but didn't want to make a fuss so we ignored that and the fact we had asked for silverware numerous times without receiving any, the waiter named Roberrt (his name tag had 2 R's) said he could FIND ANY. I finally got up and asked the manger and got some right away. Our food was average and parts were clearly microwaved and I'm sure of this because our gravy had a hard dry layer at the top. Roberrt served our bill immediately as he gave us our food and didn't give us a chance to order desert and then got upset when we told him we were not done ordering. Hot and cold food, no refills, Roberrt did not check on us once and had the worst attitude I've ever experienced. This place will never have my business again and I definitely will steer all my friends clear of this dump. Do better.",

    "text": "Classic breakfast joint by the Silverton Casino and Bass Pro Shops location. Cracker Barrel as a kid was one of my favorite destinations because it had good food and a store that sold everything under the sun. Good to know it's still the same way, as it has been decades since I had been to one.  We go to the Bass Pro Shops often whenever in town and we saw that Cracker Barrel set up shop there was well. We finally got to go on a recent trip and the experience went well. First of all, if you're there during peak breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait a little while to be seated. They have 2 rows of rocking chairs you can plop down on and wait while waiting for your table to be ready. Rocking chairs are always fun. I've never had one in any place I have lived in so its cool to me... And they have a ton of them.  I went with Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ($10.29) with country fried steak, scrambled eggs, fried apples, grits & all the fixins (biscuits & gravy, butter and jam). The meal was decent but the country fried steak was overdone. I still ate it cause I was starving having flown into town on the 1st flight but it could have been much better. Eggs were ok, biscuits & gravy were good. The grits were just ok too. My friends would later tell me I gotta get the meatloaf so if i do go back, I will try that.   Alos ordered was the Sunrise Sampler (eggs, grits, hashbrown casserole,  smoked sausage, ham, bacon & all the fixins) $9.69. It was decent too. Nothing spectacular. Just your typical breakfast meats and eggs.   Plenty of parking in a shared lot. Be prepared to wait. I think there's a way to get on the waiting list through their website. Sorry to say/see but their men's restroom was not good. They need to clean that up regularly ASAP.",

The has brown casserole which is normally dank was dry and crusty. We got our bread after our food and we never got the jam to go with it. And, just in general, the butter is impossible to spread. Aggravating.   Will probably be back eventually just because of the weight of the chain.",

It's a little bit dry. Hubby ordered steak and eggs, the steak was good, he have like 3 sunny side up eggs but ended up not eating it because he said it was kinda raw and slimy, we had the biscuits and gravy, we didn't like it.. no flavor and the gravy is kinda plain..I ordered the chicken and waffles it was just ok too. Did not finish it.. but our most favorite is the pancake!! We finished it and the syrup was really good and not too sweet! If we will ever go back here we will just order the pancakes lol",

From the staff ignoring us when we walked in, to being sat at a dirty table, it didn't start well.  We waited a very long time to have our server approach. We ordered both drink and our food all at once. We had to explain to our server which side dishes were actually available according to the menu.   Well when the food arrived is was all bad. My steak was well done instead of m-rare, but I didn't discover this until it sat in front of me for 10 minutes as they didn't give me a steak knife. My wife's chicken and dumplings were cold, my daughter only received half of her food, and the half she got was old and dry.   We mentioned all this to the manger. She assured us she would fix it all. She didn't do anything for us. In the end they didn't discount or comp any items for this terrible experience.",

Sorry to say that nothing has improved and this is the worst run CB we've been to across the country.  Went to the take-out counter to pickup our order.  No one at the counter or the registers.  Waited with two other customers for about 5 minutes before the person that had been cleaning the front windows showed up at one of the registers.  She called back for our order.  Finally a person walked out with the order.  Unfortunately only had part of the order.  Had to tell her twice the Vegetable soup and crackers were missing (she asked if we were getting chicken noodle after I told her vegetable the first time).  Got home and the soup had ZERO broth.  Just a bowl full of vegetables.  Mashed potatoes were cold and almost no gravy. Disappointed again.",

Small bowl of pinto beans and salad was the best part of the meal for me. Sister ordered eggs scrambled well done with the cheese on the side.

    "text": "There are no Cracker Barrels in CA, so this chain of restaurants has remained an elusive mystery to me for years and years. When I happened to see one while driving on highway 15 in Vegas, I decided to stop to eat there. It has an old-timey southern general store look to it. There's like a porch in the front with lots of rocking chairs that people can sit on while waiting for their table (the chairs are also for sale). There is a store part and a restaurant part. The store part is where you enter through to find the hostess and it also sells lots of random stuff. Stuff I guess your general store would've sold like moon pie and cornbread mix. They sell Cracker Barrel branded products and also things like home decor, clothes, children's toys, lotions, etc. This is also where you would order takeaway. They have a breakfast menu and a lunch/dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day. The dinner menu showed the most popular items, like the chicken n dumplings and the chicken tenderloins. The food is pretty much American/Southern food. I saw that they had a kids menu with smaller portions of their popular items and the description said it was for kids of all ages with no age limit. So I asked and they confirmed that anyone could order from the kids menu!   I ordered the chicken n dumplings and a side of the fried okra and a raspberry iced tea. The girl who took my order was really nice and gave me some recommendations when I told her it as my first time here. I had to wait soooo long for my food though. Like 30 minutes which was annoying. Takeout is supposed to be quicker. When they finally brought out my food, they apologized and said they were waiting for my biscuits to finish cooking.   The chicken n dumplings were good. I liked the dumplings part with the sauce more than the chicken, which was dry. The fried okra was good too. The biscuit was good but not amazing. And they didn't give me butter to go with my biscuit, so that was disappointing. The raspberry iced tea was refreshing and the right amount of sweetness.   Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this place since I'd always been curious about it. I can cross it off my list but I probably won't come back.",

It really took 1 hour to get our seats. When we inquired about our seats at 45minutes, we got attitude from the host. The food was crap.  The chicken was dry, the biscuits and gravy was yucky.  Not to mention when they gave me my plate I had an empty bowl where the gravy was supposed to be.",

People always say they give the most filling meal and best tasting foods, well not True.  I was surprised how bland tasting the food was and how little I was served. I ordered the egg whites, sourdough French toast meal, Beacon , and their hash browns that was a special style of the al la carte menu.   First off, they would not substitute my Beacon for any thing else on the menu like fruit or toast, I Dont eat meat. Next the sourdough French toast was bland with no flavor, the hash browns were good, but the only gave a two spoon scoopings. My coffee had floaters in it, and my egg whites were only enough for three bites. My plate had plenty of room.  I left hungry, and sad. I don't eat a lot , and I'm not a big guy, but I was still hungry. I don't think I'll ever go back, but maybe I should try their lunch next time. Never for breakfast again.",

Then one more showed. Someone in my group went to the podium and asked to add a person. She watched the attendant change our reservation from 9 to 10. After a 30 minute wait, which we expected, we were called. They had our name down and table ready for 6. We told them it was 10. So they said they have two tables, one for 6 one for 4. So we said okay. Walked to our tables to discover they were clear across the dining hall from each other. So we said no we want our table for 10. They said it would be another 25 minutes.  We said no, and decided to leave. They made the mistake and made zero efforts to resolve it. Not even an apology. Wont come back to this location ever again. Oh and note: I called to make a reservation prior to all this which they declined and said they do not accept reservations.",

The grits  seemed like they had been sitting for a while.  The bacon was not thick sliced as promised on the menu and was beyond soggy.   This was due to the fact that half the slice was undercooked.   The other half of the slice was cooked just right.   The gravy had a very strange flavor, almost chemical.   The biscuits were dry and chalky.    Another guest sitting at our table said they shouldn't even be called biscuits.   The cornbread was completely flavorless like the biscuits and so dry  you could choke on them. The apples were missing that caramel color that make them appetizing;  instead they were  more of a cream colored white.  Service was just OK. The sever  referred to all the females at the table as \"girl.\"   It's too bad; we were really looking forward to the experience.",

    "text": "To think I wasted a gift card on this meal.  Went to the location on East Craig just this past Sunday and I should have gone to In-N-Out next door.  The meal I had was really ugly.  Since so much of their menu is chicken, don't like the chicken out here, ordered the hamburger steak,  Green beans and sweet baked potato completed the meal.  The corn muffins that everyone raves about were terrible.  They were dry and had no flavor.  I do not know what kind of ground beef they use but I could still taste it Monday and it wasn't pleasant.  The best part of my meal was the blackberry cobbler and I don't usually order dessert but I had to get the taste of the hamburger out of my mouth.  I have to say the young manager, Logan and the server Denise were very nice and tried to be accommodating BUT there is not enough good service to make up for bad food. After the fact, I asked Logan why they don't have BLT's on the menu and he told me that they just took it off the menu but if I wanted one they could have made it for me.  Now you tell me? That's like taking apple pie and coffee off the menu.  I do not know who is writing these menus or who is creating the recipes but it seems that these people have no taste buds and I have found that a lot in Las Vegas.  Some people will eat anything where as I travel 15 miles for a loaf of rye bread. Cracker Barrel really needs to revamp their menu and the quality of food and I am not the only one that thinks this, talking with other people, they aren't going back any time soon either.",

    "text": "I'm sure that this newest \"West Coast\" iteration of a Southern classic joint might not hold a candle to its predecessors, but... shit! It's a freaking Cracker Barrel! And it's here in Vegas!!! So maybe a liiiiittle bit of that hype transfers over to the experience for some folks, but I can definitely see how many might feel shorted on the service or the food. I, on the other hand, had a beautiful time and am really looking forward to returning once the excitement boils over (is that ever gonna happen?)...  We were expecting a lengthy wait on post-holiday Black Friday, but we took advantage of the time to check out the Country Store for a bit. Once we were seated, bro and I ultimately decided our orders from top to bottom, put in our meals and drinks, and then....... the wait of eternity. Let's face it: this is the genesis of that triangular board peg game, and if you don't get into that (or have a fully charged smartphone), then, yes, indeed, this is going to be a PAINFULLY long wait. Not entirely unexpected, however; were you expecting a five-minute turnaround after having waited on rocking chairs outside for 2 hours???  Anyway, bro ordered the dinner sampler platter and I opted for Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast and sweet tea. Unfortunately the one thing I missed in all the excitement were the items \"on request.\" So... no bread, no apple butter :( I'm sure glad my bro asked for water!  Everyone helping us was kind and efficient and very cool. Although the food did take a lengthy period of time, I can't say we weren't taken care of! Plus the food itself came out nice and fresh: meatloaf was actually tasty (sorry I'm not a huge fan of American meatloaf), chicken n' dumplings were PERFECTION, country ham was delicious, my country fried steak was awesome, as were my biscuits, gravy (a tiiiiny bit salty but still yum), and all our other sumptuous sides. Bro opted for a baked sweet potato that *may* have been the least desirable piece of our full meal, but even then it was decent. Personally one of my favorites was the fried apples!  Anyway, we were only in Vegas for the day so we HAD to make our one and only meal in town epic. So happy Cracker Barrel was able to fulfill that destiny! Thank you, sweet hostess standing outside in the cold, super chill servers, and tchotchkies-stuffed Country Store for making our Thanksgiving weekend superb!",

The fried steak was awful and tasted metallic same as the gravy. I would not be surprised if the gravy came from a can. The eggs were cooked properly but not seasoned. The grits were bland and not seasoned as well. The service did not make up at all for the lack of the food quality. Our server did not smile and took our order incorrectly, twice. Never apologized for making a mistake just saying \"oh\" when it was brought to her attention.   This restaurant is over hyped and a disappointment.",

I do understand the idea of demand being high in order to keep the doors open but a 2 hour minimum wait at the southern location and the Craig Road location has the same issues. Employees are not the problem it is the concept and design of both locations. I can get the same quality food for half the price at Denny's. Will not be back to any Las Vegas location. You will be successful but from Tourist Dollars not mine.",

Today we were able to be seated right away, however there were very few empty tables in the packed restaurant. Our drink orders were taken right away by our waitress who introduced herself with a warm greeting . I am more impressed with their breakfast menu than lunch and dinner, but breakfast is served all day! I tried the Fish Fry, which was good. The cod was breaded and cooked very tastefully. The service was good throughout the whole meal and we were also greeted by the manager. Once your meal is complete, you take your check to he store area where you can browse before finalizing your check at the cashier.",

They placed their name down at 1130 then they say it will be ready in 10, then again in 30, then again in an hour, then 2 hours, that's enough. Sure, they shouldn't have waited that long before leaving but because Cracker Barrel is GREEDY, they kept giving them hope that they will be seated.   I feel bad for everyone who has to wait because they cannot run a restaurant correctly.   Wasn't able to try their food. Aware of long lines.

We ordered our lunches and waited about 25 minutes for the food to arrive. During that wait we were never offered refills for our coffee nor could we catch our server's eye to ask for refills. The place was very packed and the servers were all running ragged.   When the food finally arrived it was average tasting. The worst part was, it was warm, not hot. Cooked food should be served HOT! My dish was a lunch with fried catfish, mashed potatoes and whole kernel corn. It was just barely ok, because it was just barely warm.   Disappointed. Should have gone to Denny's instead.",

The eggs didn't have any flavor to them but the bacon was good. My husband got the country fried steak and eggs which came with biscuits and gravy. The gravy didn't have much of a taste. The hash-brown casserole was really good. The service was also good. Overall it was a good experience but I probably wouldn't go here for a normal breakfast place.",

    "text": "BREAKFAST: If you ask for my opinion, I would not have breakfast here. Their food is low quality and over priced for breakfast. You could literally go to a local breakfast cafe for better food, larger portions, for a better price.   LUNCH/DINNER: Their lunch and dinner is way better quality than their breakfast. The dishes are all-american favorites. Everything comes in a large portion and their sides are really great with the entrees. Their food tastes like cafeteria styled food so I wouldn't recommend this place if you looking for fresh made to order dishes. My two personal favorites are the fried chicken dinner served on Sundays and their catfish served everyday. I like to add mac n' cheese and mashed potatoes to my orders. They also serve corn bread and/or biscuits with most orders. In addition, you can add soup or salad to your meal for a few dollars.  DRINKS: Their Strawberry Lemonade is super refreshing! Personally, I like to get the bottled sodas:)  SERVICE: I guess in their defense, they are always really busy with a minimum 30 minute wait for a table....but that shouldn't be an excuse. The hosts never seem to call people in the order they come in. People get really angry and frustrated when they wait over an hour for a table and someone who came in five minutes ago slips them a tip and get in immediately. When your table is ready, the hosts take forever before they actually walk you to your table making you wait another 5 to 10 minutes for them to \"clean your table.\" Once you sit down, the tables and chairs are dirty and you have to ask someone to clean it for you. It takes forever for waiters to come get your orders and it seems like the waiters don't have stations they work at. They seem to serve all the tables which makes everything unorganized. Every time I've been here, I have to deal with them serving me broken mugs and dirty water glasses. The waiters are all super unfriendly and lazy when you ask for anything too. I have been here a few times because I want to try all their food, but it's discouraging for the customers to come here when they have horrible service every single time they come in!  STORE: Their store is the cutest thing ever with very unique snacks and novelties. I love their variety of bottled sodas in the display area, their old fashion candies, and all the cute stuffed animals!",

The biscuits were bland, the gravy like glue, the chicken fried steak was boring...oh and the grits had no taste whatsoever.

Our food was out within 20 mins and kept our drinks filled, including coffee. Pancakes are the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. EVER. They're fluffy while being buttery and crisp. They serve mini bottles of their famous 100% maple syrup. You can take the bottles as souvenirs. The country store is amazing! It always has the best little trinkets and candy available. Their prices are unbeatable and stock is always changing. So if you see something you love, buy it! One of their clerks made sure we were findings everything okay and even suggested some caramels and candy, which we ended up buying. Great location, great service! Can't wait until they open up in the high desert in cali! Recommended!",

We went once a few months after it opened and heard nothing but screaming kids, people shouting to talk over each other, servers who were RUNNING and miserable like your average denny's or ihop during sunday breakfast. It lost the atmosphere needed for the type of restaurant it was designed to be. Cracker Barrel was not designed for a city like Las Vegas.   The final straw that broke the camel's back is we attempted to go recently and give it one more shot only to learn that after how many decades they have REMOVED the only turkey sandwich they ever had from their menu. That is right people....a generic American chain restaurant no longer serves a turkey or club sandwich. I was absolutely floored at this. Meanwhile they have THREE different versions of fried chicken sandwiches (gross!). I was shocked and promptly left since both myself and the person I dine with are very very picky eaters and it is the ONLY thing we ever ate from their menu. Can anyone name a generic chain, low end American restaurant that doesn't have some sort of turkey/club sandwich? Dennys....IHop.....Friendlys....99.....Uno's.....? No? Didn't think so.   Do not EVER expect corporate to give you a response either. When I called the restaurant here back I was on hold forever, got transferred to someone \"who can help\" who simply told me that item is discontinued, no idea why, you need to call cop orate. Click. If you dine at these places and have an issue you are SOL because you will NOT receive a response or resolution. I e-mailed corporate inquiring with very specific questions and NONE were answered. Why did they remove the only turkey sandwich from their menu? Did this item not sell? Are you replacing it with another similar item or any version of a turkey sandwich? The response I received was the immediate computer generated thank you someone with respond within a couple days. So yes, a few days later I received a message that was an absolute joke with a simple non-informative statement.....\"thank you for your comments. We will forward them on to our marketing team. Please contact us if we can assist you with anything else.\" That is right folks, no answer to an English language QUESTION, not even a personalized response. I am beyond furious at their lack of communication. All I wanted was an answer, even if I did not like the answer. It tells you they don't give a flying you know what about their customers.   I will NEVER be dining here again, have thoroughly advised anyone around town who has asked me about the restaurant to avoid it and will leave this for anyone curious about dining here.",

Service was great, my unsweetened ice tea was constantly being refilled. Of course I ordered breakfast, and I already love any restaurant that serves grits as a side dish to your breakfast! And the biscuits were soft and fluffy! I absolutely love the hash brown casserole and all it's cheesy goodness! I was not a fan of the smoked sausage patty, seemed a bit dry. Also can pass on the corn muffins. And I also like that the country store sells  cool Halloween stuff and it's only July!",

First it took 45 minutes to get our food (2 people), the food was cold and had absolutely no flavor. The service was terrible i drank my drink right away and waited the entire time for a refill, which wasnt offered until she brought us the bill. Then i had to struggle to the register because the layout of this place is ridiculous and when i get to the front finally the person who should be waiting on me decides that sending a very long text is more important than my time, and by this time im dieing to get out of this noisy, cluttered, overrated, overpriced, dump they decided to call a restaurant.

I had high expectations and luckily they were all met. I was so happy it was as good as I expected.  The wait for two was about twenty minutes on a Wednesday late morning. The inside is big enough to sit a decent amount of people but small enough to feel \"Home-y\". Because it was my first time there and knew I wouldn't be back anytime soon, I got a sampler breakfast plate of eggs any style, ham, sausage and bacon, grits, hash, fried apples and biscuits. Yum yum and yum.  The biscuits were soft and warm, the hash brown casserole was seasoned well, the grits were solid, and all the meat was good. The sausage was my least favorite, though. I also didn't like the fries apples which actually look like basic baked apple pie filling. I am not a huge Apple fan period so that was no loss.  All and all it was delicious. For me, in order for a place to get five starts they need to live up to the image they present. Cracker Barrel prides itself on being an \"old country store\" and that just what it felt like. A comfortable atmosphere to get quality all American favorites and friendly service.",

There was not a wait so we were seated right away, beverages quickly.  We placed  our order from our server Danielle, our food arrived within 10 minutes.  The plates were full of food but not oversized servings.  I had uncle some bodies something which was 2 eggs, I opted for the ham steak, cheese hashbrowns, biscuits and of course grits.

They have this cute little golf tee game at the table that keeps you entertained while you wait for the food.  My only complaint was the space between the tables was cramped, but they tried to accommodate us and our stroller to the best of their ability.  I think the service was impeccable but there was nothing amazing about the food....  Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad at all, just nothing that wowed me.  I was expecting the best comfort food I've ever tasted.  But this place seems like a Claim Jumper's to me....I tried the country fried steak with mac and cheese/hasbrown casserole/dumplings.  My husband got the same thing but with a baked sweet potato/fried apples/grits.  The gravy on the chicken fried steak didn't really impress me an anything unique.  The option of 3 sides with the entree is nice so you can sample different things.  The portion size is just right for the price.  I would go again for convenience, but I probably won't be a regular.",

The wait was about 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast; their method of putting names on the waiting list is terrible as they have someone stationed right at the entrance blocking the only exit and causing a huge backup and people trying to exit have to push through those in line to waiting to have their name to the waiting list. Service was slow and poor, no attention to detail, ignored multiple requests for coffee and water refills. Food was mediocre, eggs cold, pancakes raw in the middle and inedible. Asked for help to resolve and was ignored. Placement of payment cashiers are at the back of the gift shop also a bottleneck and hazard. I realize this is a new location but they have a lot of work to do if they want repeat business. Do not recommend.",

The manager came to the table,I spoke to him about the situation but he was not listening.  I repeated that I'm immune suppressed and food not prepared properly can land me in the hospital. Oh did I mention they forgot my silverware twice! The final clincher was when the bill came. They charged me double... Once for the rare stk I sent back and then for the second stk that I actually ate. Get your act together Cracker Corner! It's not that hard to serve a meal that's HOT, cooked correctly and charge the appropriate amt on the customers check! After all this, it's 9:39 pm and we are just home after \"dinner\"...which BTW was an awful experience.  The end result? We where hastily offered ONE free desert \" if we were still hungry\". Oh and did I mention they do not do a military discount.  God Bless America!",

Okay Cooks/Line people listen up...my hubby and i are in the restaraunt biz, How would u feel if ur order was Wrong?!? Hmmm yeah, We told our server about the order, she apologized and was willing to take it back, we kno how that works...lol. And waiting for our refills on our drinks being out on the edge of the table, Granted its busy yes But at least come by and ask even if its Not Your Section...its called Team Work! One server did refill my tea but Not my hubbys and boy was he Mad. We waited a lil longer but Nothing. So i said lets go! I love the store while we waited.

This text said that my estimated wait time was 50 minutes and to check in with the host to BE SEATED once we got there. We're locals so we waited the 50 minutes and then headed over there. Once we got there the hostess said that it would be another hour. She also mentioned that if you check in on line it doesn't mean anything until you check in at the restaurant.

The guy that seated us (Dylan) definitely didn't know what he was doing. Then our server Stephen just needs to not be a server. We ordered our drinks AND food at the same time. We waited 15 minutes before I asked him where our drinks were and about time he brought that (now 20 minutes later) our food was being brought out. THEN Stephen messed up my father's order when my father clearly stated when ordering \"He doesn't eat meat (3 times),\" \"He didn't want meat\" and me telling him \"He's a Vegan.\" Then this clown saids, \"Oh I thought you were okay if the meat was still on there\" WHAT? My sausage was dry, eggs cold while my father's whole meal just wasn't good. The ONLY thing we could agree on liking was my French Toast AND that was it. The 2 stars are for the manager coming over to apologize to my father and the French Toast being to my liking. Other then that we'll stick to local breakfast spots and wait until we get to South Carolina (heck anywhere in the south) to get the BEST of what Cracker Barrel has to offer because this one in Vegas IS NOT IT AT ALL!",

We weren't asked if we wanted breakfast menus (which we did considering we got there at 10:15am).  I had to ask for them in which the waitress brought them right over.  I felt very rushed by our waitress. She gave us maybe 3 minutes before she asked if we were ready to order.  Luckily I had known what I wanted since I've been to other locations several times.  The food took another 45 minutes! (mind you we ordered breakfast!).  When we got the food my french toast & sugar cured ham were both cold! My son & daughter's pancakes were hot (so mine was obviously done first).  I didn't say anything because after 3 1/2 hours of getting to the restaurant I was starving!  The food itself was good. Just not amazing since it was cold.  The $6 piece of ham I got was very small, I cut very small pieces & only got through 1/2 of my french toast before it was gone. The poor experience I had was definitely due to the high volume.  It was odd though because there seemed to be an abundance of bussers who appeared to not have much to do.  Maybe they should have more cooks vs. bussers.  I hope to try this place again but not for a long time.",

    "text": "First visit to Cracker Barrel, probably last visit. Took my teenage boys to try this place out.. First it was very busy that's a good sign expected a wait to be seated, very confusing where you need to go. First you go in and it's a airport gift shop that sells candy to dishes and clothing. 30 min wait I'm ok with that went outside to rock on the wooden rocking chairs to hear my name called to be seated.. We get in, very loud and tight seating, place our order 35 minutes later no appetizers nothing to eat. Bring us our order it's wrong, 5 minutes retry order it's 75% right but all mixed up on different plates. Steamed broccoli they forgot to steam it. Ask 3 different people to bring us salt pepper and ketchup and one was the manager never got them. Our steak fries were given to us 20 minutes after food was served. Now it's time to leave with all 3 of us not that impressed or happy the way the dinner was served. We were asked when going through the gift shop to pay bill if everything was ok. I said to them we left most of the food on plate as it was served to us late and inconsistent. Really a bad first visit. I felt the $45.00 I spent was a bad value. They need to take care of customers when they get this type of service.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I love cracker barrel.  That said this was my first visit to the new cracker barrel in Las Vegas.  It will be my only vist.  While the wait time was long, I expected that.  It was fine.  It's what happened from the time we were called up to be seated that things went downhill.  My wife asked for a gluten free menu.  They didn't have one (despite every other one we've been to having one).  So she looked it up online and we moved on.  We ordered drinks and then shortly our food.  We thought things were going fine.  Alas...45 minutes later...no food...no check backs to offer to refill our drinks (even the manager who was table touching at every table skipped over ours...presumably he didn't want to actually be told anything was lacking...or he's blind).  So then our food comes.  My wife ordered her dressing on the side of her grilled chicken salad....only to be told it was already tossed in.  I didn't get the biscuits or muffins that came with my meal. I'd have complained...but at this point god knows how long that would have taken.  At this point, between the long wait and the slow crappy service...next time we'll go to the one in Utah or Arizona...it'll be faster and better service.",

We ordered drinks and I got iced tea my Mother got sweet tea and my Father got raspberry lemonade.  We had to flag someone down because the lemonade had no ice and was warm. I ordered the sunrise platter.  With is comes the fried apples and the hashbrown casserole.  The two other people in my party ordered diner plates and had the fried apples as sides.  As we are being serviced the server sets down the two dinner plates then mine as soon as it is in front of me he reaches to take the apples off my plate and says you don't get those, they belong to one of the dinner plates.  I tell him no I get them as well.  He says you don't but okay.  We start to eat and I notice I have no hashbrown casserole.  I flag down someone again, because I never see out server.  I explain about the meal and what it comes with and she (Kattie) tells me she will get it fixed.  A few minutes later out comes a lady in a navy blue shirt who states \"I was told to bring this here\"  she then states they never tell her why to see a table.  She does ask if there is anything else she can do, but quite frankly she did not seem to interested and I wanted to enjoy my meal so I just said that was all.  We enjoy our meal and as the server finally checks on us to clear our plates and offer refills on our drinks, that have been empty since the middle of the meal.  I says no refills, we are done.  He places the check on the table and leaves.  We were going to order dessert to go, but no way!  I know his name was Aaron and the most helpful person there and a True asset was Kattie.  Huge thank you to Kattie for all you did.",

Nic was our server and she was the sweetest!! She was very patient with all the guests around us and some of them weren't very nice to her. It was busy, cut the staff a break. When our food took awhile to come out, she went to check on our food and it came out within minutes. Food was delicious and I can't wait to go back! Ask for Nic as your server!

It ended up being around a half hour, but we were very surprised that it was so busy near closing time! It was very hot outside but thankfully on the porch there's a few fans. Service was pretty good, occasionally one of our drinks would be empty but our server stopped by frequently. I ordered a build your own side platter. I remember ordering this often when I was younger so I decided to try it out. The green beans are AWESOME! The corn, not so much, it is clearly frozen. French fries were good, but that's hard to mess up. Mac & Cheese had the nasty fuzzy texture so I didn't eat much of that. I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup...it was yummy...but it came out barely above lukewarm. My girlfriend ordered a couple entrees so she could sample a few things and nothing was WOW in quality or taste. Overall, disappointing and not what I remembered from my childhood back east. Maybe it's because they have to import everything to the desert? Also want to mention my girlfriend did get sick from eating here. We speculate that it's because food isn't kept at a high enough temperature. Nothing came out hot. Hmm...",

We arrived at 830am the hostess informed us that if we chose to sit all together (party of 11) it would be and hour and 10 min or if we did  split it would be 50 min. I asked what she meant by split? She said two tables back to back, I said okay I can put my young children at the table behind us, so we opted for the split. At 9:12 they called us and had two tables across the room from each other, that was not what she said and that was not an option since I had young children. She then said about 25 minutes more for the wait, we said ok and at 9:25 they called for a party of 10 that was seated all together. This party only waited 20 min and was seated. We spoke to the manager who admitted when we declined the tables across the room the POS system placed us back on the bottom of the list and the hostess should of realized that we should have been seated before the party of 10. He asked what he could do to make this right and my husband asked for a discount. The manager said he would do the best he can. We were finally seated at 9:50, service was fine although the waiter took our food order immediately and apologized for our inconvenience but forgot to get our drink order. When our bill came no discount was taken we spoke to the General Manager and asked about our discount, he responded by saying you were seated 11 min past the time told why would we discount. Never mind that your hostess misinformed us, never mind that you seated a large party like ours first, never mind everything that transpired during our hour and 20 min wait. All he cared about was that we were seated 11 min past the time we were promised. If we were seated 11 min past our time that would of been at 9:31 from the original 50 minutes we were told.",

Another 10 to get one cup of coffee and an unsweetened ice tea. Food arrived cold, dried out. I boxed mine up. Family ate theirs. It only took two minutes after getting our cold food to be handed the bill. Although it was crowded, and everyone else around us seemed to have great service, Steve sucked, the food poor, and dirty cups turned me off. Love my Cracker Barrels.

While on the web site, I noticed a reservation link. I clicked on the link and made a reservation for 2. The web site stated that there was about a 40 minute wait.  It took me about 50 minutes to get to the restaurant. Once I arrived, I checked in with a man at the podium. He told me to wait in the store and my name will be called shortly. As soon as I entered into the store, I heard my name being called on the PA system.  After being seated, Joseph our server acknowledged us and said that he will be with us after he delivers the food for the neighboring table.  Several minutes later, Joseph welcomed us and went over the menu. I settled on the pork chops with eggs.  The price was very reasonable ($11.50) and my wife settles on the pancakes.  The food was delivered fairly quickly  Joseph checked back with us frequently and even the managers (2 of them) asked how things were. I asked for some coffee and the manager himself got it for me. The food was very good too. I didn't like the hash browns, and the server immediately replaced them with something else.  The food was so good that I even ordered stuff for take-out.  After we finished eating, I went into the store and bought some misc. food items.  I will definitely return here again. I strongly suggest that you use the web site reservation feature in order to eliminate or reduce your wait times.",

But wait the dressing or \"cornbread stuffing\" counts as a side (wasn't that good btw) so I could only get one other side.  Chose fried apples because I overheard people saying that was what CB is known for (those were delicious btw).  When the meal comes, given we got the same thing and the other person got two sides, mashed potatoes and sweet potato casserole (very good as well), the two plates were so inconsistent and sloppy.  One was full and had 2 pieces of turkey, the other one just one piece of turkey.  Talked to the waitress and manager about the inconsistencies and the manager brought a new serving of turkey and says they do it by weight.  Not very impressed on the location at all, very small inside.  Won't be coming back because not worth it, the food or the wait.",

    "text": "Yeah! Finally Cracker Barrel opened in Las Vegas. We went the second day it opened even though I knew it would be crowded. The wait was about 30 minutes but it was fun to look around in the store before we were seated. I even found an item that I have been looking at for my house. The service was excellent, especially since they just opened. My waiter was in training but he did a good job. I gave this review less stars because the food was so bad. The grites were blah. The gravy had no taste and was runny. My ham was overcooked and so tough I could barely cut it. After one bite I had to leave it because didn't want to choke. The noise level was outrageous. BUT, I will go again when things have calmed down a bit. Hopefully the kitchen will improve. I want to go to lunch sometime to try their famous fried chicken. Hopefully it will be as advertised.",

Take out orders are not even started until you get there to pick them up. Food is served cold, portions are small.Trying to get a beverage refilled is like asking for a free ride to Chicago.Noise level inside the dining area is deafening.You have to yell across your table.There are people PICKETING outside the business about a labor dispute.When we asked a employee about it she said she is not allowed to talk about it.The manager on duty will stop by and ask you \"hows things are going\". When you tell them you are not happy, they too disappear like the servers, never to be seen again.If they offer any kind of compensation it will be a free drink.It's become apparent that this is indeed the business model for this location. We feel there will not be any improvements. Why should there be? The place is packed with tourists.Were done with this place, you win. We have taken our dining business to other eateries",

I cannot remember my server's name, but she was a very kind African-American Lady.  She was very good and very quick with my food.  She kept my tea glass full, too.  I ordered the Grandpa's Country Breakfast with Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs, Fried Apples, Grits and Biscuits.   And the steak was good and tender.  The gravy was outstanding.  My eggs were cooked right.  The apples were good.  I don't eat grits.  And the biscuits were late getting to the table, but they were hot and fresh, so no complaints.  I felt bad for the staff, as there were a couple of guys who had clearly been drinking all night that came in and were being rude and complaining about the food.  The staff handled it well and were all very good and kind.  I enjoyed my breakfast.",

    "text": "Normally the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain is very good. Today, one of my two chicken patties on a biscuit had under cooked chicken on it, however, the other one was good. There seemed to be plenty of staff; but, the poor lady helping me had far too many tables to keep up... it's simply made things a bit slow. Then checking out and paying for the meal was par for the course. The lady that was trying to check me out kept telling me to insert my card chip in to the machine, and repeatedly I told her there is no chip on this card. After about 10 minutes she was able to figure out her register and complete the sale as needed. That explains to me why the line was so long to begin with.  The team was probably just having a bad day because normally there is nothing better than Cracker Barrel food. It is certainly worth giving this restaurant to try even though I am only giving them three stars.",

I arrived 20 mins after I placed the call and was told by Destani that they brought my food out 10 mins prior to me coming. I pod and still had to wait another 20 minutes before they brought my food out. I almost asked for a refund because they were taking forever. Not only that, she asked me to fill out my receipt and I put my total as $15 and she still charged me for $16, in which I didn't make a big deal of. Fast forward......I got back to my hotel, 25 minutes away and my food wasn't what it was supposed to be. It was much less meat than it's supposed it be. In fact, it was only two bites of meat and plenty veggies. I will NEVER come to this location ever again.",

The service was wonderful from Frank our server he was on point with the food and drinks didn't even have to ask for anything he checked up on us making sure everything was up to par which it was. Every one here is friendly courteous and happy to be part of Cracker Barrel. Thank you for such wonderful service and food. I recommend everyone to come by and try it out",

I wasn't the most delighted with the eggs though they were a bit undercooked while the bacon was over cooked.

As compared to food I've had at Cracker Barrels in the south or in St. George, Utah, this one really did not satisfy. I would rather make a special trip to St. George than drive 10 minutes to go here.  As mentioned with other reviews, the wait times are extraordinarily long.

Got there around 11am on a Sunday, the hour wait was a given and didn't phase us. Took a short walk over to Bass Pro Shops to pass the time. Got a text notification that our table was ready, about an hour and 10 mins later.   Favorites - the melt in your mouth pancakes, cheesy hash brown casserole, and biscuits & gravy.   Service was excellent. Shout out to the hostesses for their patience after dealing with hangry people trying to break down the door all day!  Management, your girls are doing great work!",

Said ok cool I can be patient, I sorta lost my patience when my water remained empty no joke (20min) before I had to ask another waiter for a refill. Food comes and what do you know, not even hot it was barley warm like it was sitting, kids didn't get ketchup or mayo with there burgers, wife's sausage tasted weird, and no biscuits but everyone else got some.. I normally never leave a crap tip or complain seem that I am in the food and beverage industry but this crap here was ridiculous. Won't be taking my wife and kids here ever again. Bad choice to bring her on her 30th birthday hoping for a great experience.",

I have to say I don't understand the hype and I don't know how this place is open.. The ambiance is cool and most of the servers are nice. However the food is mediocre and needs to be seasoned with something other than air. It gets the job done of satisfying hunger but leaves you feeling like you're missing something for sure. I give it two stars for environment, effort, and staff.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by someone I know has similar taste in food and once again it was a success.  I arrived with a party of 4 and our wait time was 25 minutes but luckily we only had to wait 15 of those minutes.  It was of course hotter than the devils armpit outside but the misters made the wait very manageable.  Plus there are cool rocking chairs for guest to sit while they wait and potentially purchase.  I definitely felt like I was sitting on the front porch at my neighbors house, it was very comfortable.  Anyway, once seated we were greeted promptly by our server Jacque ( I hope I spelled that right).  Jacque made our experience very pleasant. My girlfriend and her parents were grateful for the flexibility when it came to switching out items on the combinations they chose to better suit their desires. The food was awesome.  I tried momma's pancake breakfast with a side order of hash brown casserole.  The pancakes were cooked perfect with that delicious crisp around the edges. I love that the pure natural syrup comes in a small glass bottle, although one bottle is not enough for the three pancakes you get with that meal I was still very satisfied. You get a choice between sausage and bacon, I chose the sausage and thought it was fine but my party thought it was to salty.  The hash brown casserole was a nice addition to the meal for some extra flavor and texture.  I made sure to purchase a box of the pancake mix for my cousin Ola (the person who recommended this place) for telling me about this place.  Thank you Jacque for the wonderful service and thank you cracker barrel for the great food",

I suggest registering online if you're going on a weekend. We did it about 20 min before arrival and once there we were seated and ordering drinks within 10. Brit was great! She was quick, helpful and awesome. Rather than having us order separate items as we were doing she told us of a meal we could order that had everything we wanted. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a hearty breakfast. Very family friendly as well.",

After sending it back, the manager returned with made to order eggs and some of the same pink, rubbery bacon that had been heated up.  Ridiculous that they can't get breakfast right on a Sunday morning when the place is half empty.",

That being said, this location is not nearly as good as the locations I visited while living in Florida.  I still make the trip out for the Sunday chicken dinners though.  I always have to get the hashbrown casserole.  Beware the candy sticks labeling though.  When they run out of a certain flavor, they fill it up with a different flavor but keep the original label.  Ex. Last time I went they had run out of watermelon.  I didn't realize until I got home they replaced watermelon with bubblegum but kept the watermelon tag on it.  I was bummed to end up with 5 bubblegums when I thought it was watermelon.",

Yesterday was my birthday and my friend took me to now my once favorite restaurant and I had a miserable visit. 1st we at least got greated and seated by very friendly lady named Cathy. Once my friend and I were seated our waitress walked by us no greating no asking what we wanted to drink nothing we were totally ignored. 10 min goes by and the bus boy I think his name was Jesus said he noticed we have been ignored and because he couldn't really assist us he would get us started. We'll the original waitress kept ignoring us. We finished our drinks the lady grabbed my friends glass for a refill never came back so I quit eating and was so upset I told my friend I wanted to leave. My friend asked for a manager he came and he was a cocky little boy after my friend told him what had happened he littlerly said I'll give y'all a super sized drink to go. It was like he was hinting us to get out. The look on his face was like he actually wanted us to go. Yeah he gave us a discount and didn't charge us for a drink he only did that to save his butt. No excuses my birthday ended bad because of your resturant. Y'all need a friendly manager and better waitresses. I'm sadden to say this was once my me and my mom's favorite restaurant now we will never go back. My mom and I really loved your restaurant we used to go every Sunday. I hope something is done about this.",

    "text": "The worst thing about this inexplicably popular restaurant is the wait. Why were so many people clamoring to stuff themselves with bland, mushy, carb-laden food on a hot day?  But, one our friends REALLY wanted to go there, and she was willing to go early to put our name on the list, so off we went. We did wait for a while, but we rocked in the chairs out front where it was shady and the time went pleasantly enough. Then, we were ushered in to be seated in the most crowded, noisy environment possible. They were cramming way too many people in too small of a space. Everyone was bumping the person behind them, the servers couldn't get between tables, and you had to take a scenic course to get to the restroom. etc. Hated it.  I vaguely remembered visiting a Cracker Barrel in AZ, and it being a pleasant experience. After my memory was refreshed by this visit, I remembered liking the cute store, the little peg games, and the hash brown casserole. Virtually everything else was an example of home cooking from someone who was not a very good cook.  The servers were pleasant enough, but they brought everyone's food at a different time; my sister's toast was cold and unbuttered, and they brought out rock hard butter LATER which could not be spread;my server asked which two sides I wanted with my sandwich then charge d me for both when it turned out there was only supposed to be one. (Her error- my penalty), etc.   These were only a few of the gaffes- followed by another unpleasant experience while trying to pay the check. They force you to go stand in line in the gift shop so you might buy some extra crap, and the little old lady at the register bungled the simple operation of check splitting so badly that some people paid for things they didn't order, but wanted out so badly it wasn't worth it to try and correct it.   Some of this could probably be attributed to a fairly recent opening, but there is nothing there that is good enough to warrant the trip, the wait, or the money. Some folks seem to think so but I bet I can guess who they're voting for for president, so disregard their opinion.",

I understand they need to turn tables but geez let me look over the menu! I was so excited to have my breakfast but unfortunately most items came with eggs on the menu. I asked her if I could substitute the eggs for anything else. She said she would have to ask her manager, she did and the manager said it would be an extra charge. I was appalled that the manager and the waitress didn't even try to suggest anything and that they would take 25 cents off for the eggs! The food was mediocre you can tell they mass prep a lot of the food as it was cold, and the cheese has already harden from sitting out.

Our server was Kassie and she was wonderful, friendly, efficient, attentive and ensured our food was cooked exactly as requested......eggs, well done turkey sausage, crispy bacon and of course perfect pancakes.  Our drinks were refilled when required and all in all we had a perfect breakfast and intend to return tomorrow before we return to LA  ps......also loved the warm biscuits and the warm syrup",

    "text": "So today I finally got to try this place! I'm a mom of a 9 month old and don't get out much anymore. Lol. I took my dad and son to brunch and the waitress was very quick to get our order. Finally we ordered and she forgot a few things but brought them. No big deal. Then my dad got coffee and every time he saw the girl come around she went to every table but ours. He finally asked for a refill when the server finally came back. The food was good but the gravy wasn't hot. We loved the hash browns! Service was fine. BUT when we went to check out there were three ppl at the registers and while I juggle my son, diaper bag, and high chair cover no one acknowledges us to check us out. THREE ppl! I mean the guy is literally just looking at me struggle and still doesn't offer to check us out. Finally he goes \"I'll take care of you here.\" Well thank you for finally stepping up to do your job. The two ladies were sweet and could tell I was irritated at his rudeness. There was no one else there but us so it was strange that no one wanted to help us. Anyways, I asked my dad to add a 20% tip and the guy literally tells my dad an amount to write which wasn't even 20% it was 30%!!! In what world is it ok for an employee to tell a guest an amount to tip especially when it's not even close to what I asked! They were lucky I was still giving the 20% but it wasn't the servers fault. And I never asked for his input. So my review is that they solicit tips here and don't have any country hospitality.",

Our server took them back. When she returned, the dishes were hot, but the grits were still room temperature. I'm guessing microwave. I don't like microwaved food, so I didn't eat the grits (plus they were still cold). Both of my daughters' eggs came out fine, but mine were undercooked. Scrambled eggs, raw in the center. Gross. Bacon was fine, hash brown casserole was amazing, biscuits and gravy were good. Server had way too many tables. We asked for things three times and she forgot, the girl who brought my biscuits dropped one on the floor and said she'd bring another (she never came back, we had to ask the server). The tables were clean, hostess was great, we got seated quickly, bathrooms were clean, store was well organized and clean, paying our check was fast and pleasant. I'll give it another shot, but if I have a similar issue with the food, we won't be returning a third time. All food should come out HOT and fully cooked.",

A favorite Yelp friend invited me to breakfast to check it out and we had a pleasant, tasty morning.  We tried a couple of the larger sampler plates and tried a variety of dishes- my favorite was the hash brown casserole (get it cheesy!), as well as the pecan pancakes. The grits and biscuits are solid as well. Most breakfast plates have eggs and at least one of the meats, and the chicken fried chicken is a good choice (only on the Grandpa plate!). Whatever you get, the portions are huge, so come extra hungry or expect to leave with a takeout box.   The biggest tip I can give is to go early (~8am) or on a weekday to avoid ridiculous wait times. If you do end up waiting, browse the country store or grab a rocker on the patio to pass the time. Even at the table, games are provided to engage with your group!",

Service was definitely good here.  We were first timers so we rec'd some recommended selections.  Husband and I went with Uncle Hershel's plate, came with eggs, meat side and biscuits and gravy.  So strange, our b&g were served separately and with gravy on the side as well.  I was looking for it to be drenched with gravy.  Anyhow, decent food, nice service, some peg game to play while you wait for your food.  Oh! I did like the flavored iced tea...a squeeze of lemon, it was perfect.  I must say, prices were decent, good for traveling families.    Id try them again if there was one nearby where I live.  I would try breakfast...maybe pancakes or waffles.  Worth a try at least once if you get a chance.",

I was happy one opened in the Vegas area.  The southern feel starts out with their 'front porch and rocking chairs.  The front of the restaurant serves as a gift shop full of treats reminiscent of the good old days.    We walked up around 8 on a Sunday morning.  Luckily we didn't have any wait to be seated.  Being a new business to the area we weren't sure.  Fortunately good service prevailed during our breakfast.  Refills were abundant and done very politely.    One thing I knew for sure was to order Mama's Pancake Breakfast. Why? For the Pecan Pancakes.  I have enjoyed them at various locations across the country and they have always satisfied.  Would you have guessed it? They were still great! They also offer sugar free syrup for crazy people like me.    In addition to the pancakes, mama's is also served with two eggs and sausage how you want them.  It's really a complete breakfast for me.    I enjoyed my trip down memory lane.  Ya'll check it out!",

She didnt greet us when approaching the table, when taking our order didnt communicate with us (ask how we would like things cooked, what side we would like, ect.) she just stares blankly. She never came back to check on us or ask if we needed refills on beverages. Upon bringing my order my eggs were clearly not cooked the whites completely raw and I asked for my order to be remade. With a snarky attitude she asked \"well how cooked do you want them\". My family seemed okay with the quality of their meals but expressed they've had a better meal at iHop. Bottom line we would never come back and Camryn should consider a career outside of customer service.",

Second it is close to the South Point Hotel and Casino, our fave place to stay.  Third, it is soooo country style! Food like my mom used to make when she felt like cooking! It is all country style and I love it.  I hate grits, but even those aren't half bad at the Cracker Barrel.    I love breakfast best there, but lunch and dinner are smoking good too, I am told.  After eating, check out the gift shop.  There are bunches of really cool Americana and country style items there. They also sell things like their pancake batter, syrup and other items you may have sampled and liked during your meal.    I just love Cracker Barrel since my first time there with my wife's Auntie Ambie in Virginia! I can't wait to make it a breakfast hangout when they open here in Bako.

    "text": "News Flash!  Las Vegas has a Cracker Barrel! It's the first and only one on the West Coast!  So First Up! CB is across from Silverton, on your right side coming from Dean Martin BLVD...just follow the signs. Make sure when you go in, find the hostess podium or there may be one right as you walk in, Leave your name and how many in your party.  They'll let you know how long the wait is. Make sure you are close by the speaker system so you can hear your name being called when your table is ready!   Got two visits in, the first, on their grand opening day, the latter two weeks later.  Despite the wait times (1 1/2 hours and 45 min) Everyone seemed to be in a good mood. I killed time browsing thru the country store that was filled with boutiquey like stuff, kitchen goods, novelty foods and throwback candy.   They have plenty of rocking chairs, fans overhead, two industrial electrical fans, a water cooler on the front \"porch\" to keep everyone as comfortable as much as they can while waiting,  Food Just going to gloss over this part because not much to it.  I love Southern comfort- stick-to-your ribs and hips kinda food.  The biscuits are warm and fluffy, the corn muffins, buttery, chicken and dumplings, hearty, fried apples, yummy.  The open faced Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, was a disappointment. Not how Mr. B remembered having it when we dined in CB in AZ. The meat was tender, but they were skimpy on the gravy here.     If you compare this place to Black Bear Diner (the West Coast version of down home cookin) you'll be disappointed in the portions and overall taste from here.  Cracker Barrel was more on the bland side.    They also lack plating skills..lol...but that's just the foodtographer in me talking. Everything looked like it was just slung on your plate and moved down an assembly line. Nothing wrong with that, but my carrots looked lonely on that big plate.  Price It's great!  Budget friendly. Young families, retirees on a budget, or travelers will appreciate this place more. That's what the clientele make up here was.   Service Our experience was awesome both visits.  ALL the staff were upbeat and confident! Our server and her helpers were pretty efficient. Despite how crazy busy it was, our drinks got refilled, plates cleared out, no long wait on orders on both visits. The line was long on both times when we went up to pay, but we got thru it pretty quickly.   While we enjoyed the nostalgia and downhome aspect, for locals like me it's a one and done thing for now. It is a nice place to bond with fam and friends though, they 'll keep you occupied if your wait time is long!",

    "text": "On our way back to San Diego after Spring Break in Vegas & we just wanted to stop for a bite to eat before hitting the road.  Saw this place as we were driving by on the 15 & have always wanted to try them as we continually see commercials in town & have never seen one around, so we wound our way back to find a 45 minute wait, which made us think maybe it was a pretty good chain place to go... WRONG!  First, the customer service could use some improvement.  The lady out front taking names was friendly enough, but the waitress not so much.  Without being downright rude, she was about as unfriendly as you could get.  Very curt when speaking w/ you, sort of just drops the plate in front of you & if you want a refill or something, you practically have to turn into one of those guys on the runway of an airport w/ the light sticks to direct airplanes flailing your arms all around.  Second, the menu/specials are confusing.  They have a chicken fried steak breakfast & a separate one for lunch (only the lunch one is on the menu... other one was a special).  The breakfast one comes w/ 3 sides, none of which are any good... NO eggs, bacon or sausage (just things like mushrooms, etc.).  So, since you can't order breakfast items w/ your breakfast, I chose the lunch version & except for the French fries, the selections are just about as bad... enough so, the fries were the only thing I wanted as a side.  They offered to do 2 of the sides as fries, but not the 3rd for whatever reason, so I ordered a salad that my wife wanted.  & third (& most importantly), the food... practically inedible!  Not sure if all Cracker Barrels are this bad, but this one was disgusting!  Back to the aforementioned salad... it was basically a small salad w/ a TON of dressing on it... yuck!  The French fries were dry, stale & chewy. The chicken-fried steak tasted like it went through a conveyor belt, had some premixed breading that's stored in a plastic bag stamped on each side, flash fried & then flash frozen for shipping.  The gravy was pure white & tasted funky.  Literally the ONLY good thing here was leaving!",

    "text": "First let me say that I love and grew up on visiting Cracker Barrel. With that being said it takes a lot for me to leave a one star rating but it has been coming since this location opened. Let me start by saying that ...yes we were one of the families that waited the two hour wait when this location opened. We were there July 25th!...their grand opening. This location lacks everything that Cracker Barrel creates...good food relaxed atmosphere and a feeling of \"home\". The staff overall is nice and the managers seem nice as well but everything is wrong. The food is just not up to standard.  Many times...too many to count ...our food has been lukewarm and not correct portion size. Honestly after this past Sunday visit of having grits with absolutely no salt and tasted very water down...I won't be going back. The country ham was like rubber. I had been told we are out of glasses so we are giving paper cups..by the waitress. They've been out of straws different jellies and out of biscuits... biscuits.... One waitress actually brought me a picture to show me that all the pans were out in the back because I was shocked that they didn't have any biscuits. It is loud and not a good design for people to be able to have conversations ...it feels like you're packed in like sardines! After being so excited that this chain was here in Vegas ...I'm very disappointed. Not the Cracker Barrel our family grew up on and have loved to visit through the years. I don't know what is going on internally but it needs to be corrected.",

However, I have been to this location twice with different people and it was not the best experience.    I usually get the pot roast dinner and it was very fatty, the muffins were dry, and the service was average.  I also ate breakfast there and when I received the bacon, it was cold, not good \"since I'm a meat and potatoes\" guy and grew up in the Midwest.  Would I recommend this location, absolutely not.  Much work to do to bring it up to the standard that we the customer deserves and I know they can provide.  Hit a casino buffet, you cant go wrong!",

And once we got seated it took over 30 minutes to bring our food.   I do want to clarify a few things though. This restaurant had only been open for 2 weeks. It is the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas. It's understanding that it would be busy.    When we checked in they said 40 minutes so we decided to wait it out.  I did like the fact that they had large rocking chairs and checkers to play on the deck. You could try them out and actually buy them from the store!  (Nice touch)  The food was extremely yummy. But not sure it was worth the wait. Good thing we had trail mix with us!   Will I be back?    Yes!  But maybe I'll wait until the newness calms down.",

And it's hard to believe because it's definitely not based on the food. Coming on a Sunday morning, we waited about 30-40min for a table which is normal for the time and day. While we waited, we walked around their country store filled with various items and holiday goods. The servers was very friendly and helpful. But I would never ear here again. The food was mediocre at best. The pancakes were dry and so were the biscuits. Everyone in our party felt similarly about the food. The food was on the cheaper side and so was the quality.",

We ended up buying a few things, but that is where the good experience ended. After we ordered we were brought some cornbread and biscuits, as much as you want to DO NOT EAT THE BISCUITS AND CORNBREAD!!!!!!! The cornbread is chalky and the biscuits have no flavor! Then our food came, mind you we should have walked out but we were starving. The steak was over cooked Had no seasoning what so ever. The corn and the Mac and cheese we just as gross. The country fried steak looked like someone ran over it and the gravy tasted like nothing but flour. We ordered our son some French fries to eat and they came about 10 minuets after we got our food. While we were waiting for them I joked well they can't mess up fries, but guess what!!!!!! The fries were still raw on the the inside!!!!! Needless to say this restaurant chain is on my band list and we will never be back.",

I love Goo Goo and this is only place I knows that sells it at the gift shop by the cashiers in candy section on the wall.   This time for lunch I ordered their homemade jam burger with bacon  instead of the combo platter I got last time that was just alright in taste but it was a huge portion.   That burger was excellent A+! I like that sweet taste with the burger and came with sweet coleslaw and fries. The free cornbread and biscuits was nice appetizer to start with.   This place is good if you want old country cooking. Next time I to try their meatloaf platter combo. Your experience will be different depending what you order. I remember I ordered their haddock  fish combo and the fish was bland with not much flavor.  So this place can be a hit or miss, depending what you order. Go for main course and if still hungry I would go elsewhere for dessert.",

    "text": "Breakfast for dinner in Las Vegas...  In all of the years that I've been vacationing in Las Vegas, I have never been to Cracker Barrel. I'd see it every time from the I-15 freeway as I drove between Downtown and Belz Outlet (now known as Las Vegas Outlet South). I didn't even know what it was.   This time, we needed dinner and this restaurant was relatively close by. I was with the Yelpers from Los Angeles and they knew what it was. One had been to this location and the other gal had been to other locations across the US. The closest Cracker Barrel to LA is in Victorville...kind of a far drive...  So...it was time for me to get schooled. Cracker Barrel is a Country Store with a restaurant. We entered through the store and were immediately greeted with the fragrance of the Holiday Season! It was the scent of cinnamon, Christmas tree, and happiness all-in-one!  We perused the clothing, greeting cards, candles, candy, plushies, and more! Besides UNLV gear, there was a small supply of Golden Knights golf shirts. I snatched one up!  Yay!  On the restaurant side, the decor is memorabilia and knick knacks from days long past. I recognized a wash board, a coffee grinder, and farm tools. The fireplace caught my attention and I wondered if it's lit during the wintertime?  I didn't take photos of the menus because it's overwhelming! We got three menus: breakfast (served all day), lunch and dinner, and the specials. Wow...so many choices! I finally selected the Fresh Start which included a yogurt, blueberry muffin, fresh fruit, eggs, and Bacon! Yum! Chel gave me a dumpling (from chicken and dumplings) off of her Sampler platter and it was a good food exposure for me. Haha! I was full from the complimentary cornbread and biscuits (mmm), so I took them to go!  Jamie was our patient, good humored, hard working, and efficient server!  She endured our \"jokes\" and offered me a refill of my Holiday tea before I asked! Jamie brought us more Apple Butter when ours \"slipped\" off from the table and she made our visit a pleasant one!  I sure would return with more friends and family! This is such a comforting place with a warm, homey feel! It was a great kick start to our Holiday Season!",

Ok. On to the foods-  House biscuits and corn bread came with apple butter.  YuM!  While the rest of my company ordered their breakfast meals, I ordered their CB Dinner sampler which consists of ham (good), chicken dumplings (yum), and meatloaf (eh) with sides of the most delicious baked sweet potato ever (had butter and brown sugar on top, thank you!)  The other sides I chose were kale, brussel sprouts, and pecan salad and fresh fruit.  Loved that salad too, refreshing and super healthy too! Sooooooooo much food!   All flavors were amazing.

We walked in and immediately were seated. The place was super empty, and the waiter told us it's usually busy but due to the holiday it was slow. The waiter was super courteous and attentive which I appreciate. I ordered the roast beef plate with mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and a side salad. The side salad was small and the perfect side. I wasn't thrilled with the mashed potatoes and gravy, the gravy wasn't flavorful at all. The roast beef was cooked to medium which I loved, but again the gravy wasn't that great and it lacked seasoning so I added salt and pepper. I was a but disappointed because I was wanting some delicious comfort food, but got a mediocre meal. On the positive side I can say I tried this place. As for going back maybe I'll have to try the chicken, I heard that was delicious.",

I got the buttercrunch iced coffee to go after having a mello yello while there, I also had breakfast for dinner--eggs, hashbrown casserole, smoked sausages and it comes with biscuits and gravy and grits--YUM!  My friends who were with me also enjoyed their food even though my friend Polly had to order a chicken salad thanks to the dice but she loved it...  The only problem we all had was that we felt very rushed.   The waiter brought our reciept 3 times even though we told him that we wanted dessert or something to go (like my coffee)   and then he asked if we wanted to go boxes twice while Polly was still eating....  I dunno, service needs to be better for us to return but the food is great as I said...  The country store is cool, I bought my friend a soap dish she wanted, I wish they still had my Naylor Mints, why did they stop selling those?  :(",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Vegas for the weekend and I was so happy to see a Cracker Barrel. The only time I had it was a couple of years ago in Orlando and I remember having a great breakfast. Well, we stopped for brunch on Saturday and of course, it was busy. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated which we were fine with and we ordered our food and drinks. The food was absolutely delicious; it tasted the way home cooked meals are supposed to taste and the atmosphere was cozy. The peach iced tea was BOMB. I keep craving it ever since. The one thing that stood out the most and the main reason why we look forward to returning to this Cracker Barrel location was the amazing service we received from Tori, our waitress/server. Seriously, she went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meals. If she is still at this location when we return, I hope she gets our table! :)",

    "text": "This place is awful. I used to love the times we would find a Cracker Barrel on a road trip through AZ. I've been to this location in Vegas a few times, and it gets worse every time. It's ruining my whole love of Cracker Barrel. I hope it's just this location that sucks, and the whole chain hasn't deteriorated. They keep advertising their new fried chicken. Well they need to stop because it's awful. The coating is bland. The chicken is dry and flavorless. My wife had the chicken fried chicken which had too much breading. The service was pretty bad as well. We would ask for things, and they would come back and say \"oh, I need to get that for you.\"  I asked the floor manager for aus jus for my daughter's steak. She asked for Med/well and it came out over well. Anyway, she walks to the back, and never comes out again. We tell the waitress, and it takes two tries before she actually brings it out. My daughter had about two small pieces of steak left when she finally got the jus.  Then there was a weird carnival vibe to the place. There was a guy sitting at a table across from us staring our way. Apparently, he was the waitress' boyfriend or husband. At one point she passes him, and sits on his lap. They were probably in their 40's, not teenagers. A couple at a table next to us made a comment to them, and then there was some awkward laughing. Not sure exactly what was said. I think the waitress should have her man wait outside or keep their interaction limited. Just seemed inappropriate in a family restaurant.  Anyway, that may have been my last visit to that location. I will probably try another Cracker Barrel to see if they have gone downhill as a franchise or if it's just the Vegas location.",

I was not familiar with anything Cracker Barrel. So this was really fun. I loved rocking in those chairs out front.   They called us right on time and took us inside. The place was PACKED!!! Wow it was amazing. We sat down and our waitress was there within seconds. She gave us great recommendations and we ordered the Grandma's Sampler and the Momma's French Toast Breakfast.   That food came out within 10 minutes. It was shocking because the place was so busy. But the food was hot and tasted great. The french toast was out of this world. I loved that it didn't have cinnamon in it because I am allergic. Those hash browns though--- wow. I think next time I will just order the french toast and a huge side of hash browns.  I loved that everyone looked so happy having their breakfast. The manager came over to check on our meal and that was nice too.   The store has a lot of fun stuff to look at. They even have old style candy for sale. Can't wait to go back.",

I have NEVER had such terrible service at this location as we did tonight. The table next to us had thier bill discounted 50%  because they messed up thier order as well, not sure if it was the same waitress we had as she just disappeared.

My primary entree was the ribeye steak with broccoli, seasonal fruit, and a baked potatoe.   The steak was cooked medium well as requested, but was somewhat lacking in seasoning. The baked potatoe was a little overbaked. The broccoli was pretty good. The fruit was black eries. Blueberries, and pineapple   The customer service was fantastic, we were constantly being checked on to ensure everything was ok.  Food taste needs some improvement.",

The complementary corn bread muffin so good with butter and jam. The biscuit was all good but I prefer the corn bread. The services was on point. Lisa who helped us was so funny and friendly. I love a good waitress to make my dining great. Services is also important in eating out. And Lisa made it memorable.   We ordered the Haddock, country fried steak which to me needed more gravy and they provided more, meatloaf, pork chop specials, prime rib, and fried shrimp with mac and cheese. Our sides where fried okra, Mac and cheese, dumplings, hash brown casserole, baked potato, broccoli, Brussels sprouts with kale salad (only thing that I didn't like), corn ( my daughter didn't like which is weird cause she loves corn.) and fries.   Our dinner was amazing just a few sides we didn't like. But all the main dishes was excellent! I would definitely come back. I want to try the chicken pot pie (weds) and buttermilk fried chicken (Sunday). Which are on special days only!  Big parking lot. You may have to wait awhile if you plan on going on weekends. So either be put on the waitlist or come early. We went on a week night and it was not long of a wait they just had to set up a table and clean it.",

The store front was clean and well kept. I also thought the restaurant was clean and well-kept as well.  The customer service in the restaurant is what needed the most help and it is why they were only given 3 stars. Breakfast servers should be cheery and happy... that is what I look for in my breakfast places as a Las Vegas local. Take a note from the customer service from the staff in the shop. Maybe smile more... maybe come by our table and fill drinks more or let us know our order coming? Especially knowing it was looking like we were there over 30 min just waiting.   During the 1 hour time of waiting for our order, I observed different people being served before our party of 4.... although they were seated after us. It didn't seem to matter how many were in their party. Looks like perhaps it just depends on the server and or what they ordered. Amazing cheery customer service could have eliminated any kind of negative perspective first thing in a person's morning.",

All day breakfast is a plus and the chicken and dumplings are awesome. Be prepared to leave stuffed.   I am so glad to finally have a location in Vegas. All the 1 star line complainers need to move along. Don't get in line if you don't have the patience.",

The store in front of restaurant very cute and unique. Staff was very friendly ! Unfortunately not impressed by the food at all. Biscuits and gravy was bland no flavor. Turkey sausage was hard. Pecan  pancakes would have been better with less pecans in them. The hash brown casserole was okay , Eggs & turkey bacon were cooked good . It's confusing how the mix everything on small plates too . They put my husbands and I food together , my children ended up having 2 plates each taking up too much room and making it more difficult to move food around so I could cut there pancakes  . I have 3 children , so those of you who have few kids understand this lol .   I was really excited to try a new breakfast spot but this one I will not go back to .",

We had a nice waitress but it took 30 minutes to get water & teas (NOT till after we got served salad) and had to ask for our drinks the 2nd time! Even a nearby table received their drinks quicker and they JUST sat down! Next were the Entrees, my Mom ordered the Pot Pie which was the lunch Special so it was (guessing) sitting for 4 hours. It smelt like dog food and my Mom completely lost her appetite and just couldn't think of eating. I ordered the (small plate) of chicken & dumplings with corn & mashed potatoes, it was okay it just hit my stomach like a Brick. Dad had the Meatloaf & mashed potatoes( it was a \"6\" from a 1-10) FYI it's very THICK. The biscuits were the Best thing there!",

    "text": "BEST PLACE TO EAT & SHOP!  Upon entering the store is like walking into your Grandma / or Country's friends home with that faint pumpkin spice / cinnamon / apple butter / bacon cooking / goodness aroma. This is truly a down-to-earth, family, home cooking type atmosphere. I love the warm feeling you receive from entering the doors. The hostess is friendly, the sales associates (if you have to wait & browse) are knowledgeable & outgoing. The layout, the items on display and for sale make this a cozy place to chill & walk around. If you want to extra chill while you wait, just sit in the cozy rockers outside. Note: If it's HOT weather in Vegas, they do have the \"water misters\" on to keep you cool while you wait.  WAIT TIME INFO: The store opens at 6am (no wait time) and probably starts getting busy at 9:30 am with a 1 hour wait time. As I'm sitting writing this, it's 11:22 am on a Wednesday, the wait time is only 30 minutes. YES, I've also been here at 6pm (duh dinner time) and had an hour plus wait time. Don't let the other reviews from people about WAIT TIMES scare you.   There's a couple of factors that you have to consider when making a \"Cracker Barrel\" breakfast/lunch/dinner 'DO I WANT TO WAIT' decision:  #1: What time of day are you eating? If you want to save yourself some time, call them directly at the Dean Martin location and they will gladly let you know the current wait time. Their number is: (702) 474-1120 and PRESS #3 to speak to an Associate. I did this and they were so friendly! Challenge solved!  #2: They just opened THIS location on July 25th, 2016. Give them a break. You KNOW everyone and their Uncles & Grandmas families will be here PLUS all the tourists? WOW! This speaks volumes. I say they are doing their thing considering the 'craziness' that happens when a new place as great as Cracker Barrel opens. I understand employees that get overwhelmed and it's busy....stuff happens.  #3: If you DO have to wait, take the time to BROWSE the store. THE STORE IS AMAAAAZING!!! Seriously, not fibbing. You can spend HOURS just in their retail store looking at every interesting item like wood wicked scented candles, Burt's bees entire collection of awesome items, Specialty DAD's Sodas, pancake mix, bacon (have to ask them at the register to get you some from the back), cutest baby clothes & toys, women's clothes, UNLV merchandise, various sports team items, holiday decorations, old school & new school candies, kitchen decor, Yankee candles, & SO MUCH MORE!!! CAN YOU TELL I LOVE THE STORE!!  FOOD: Two menus to choose from: Breakfast OR Lunch & Dinner. I always get both. There are a myriad of items to choose from and although I haven't tried everything, it's always fresh and every location I've tried (Utah, Montana and now Nevada) never disappoint me. My favorites include, (Breakfast) Old Timer's Breakfast or Momma's French Toast and I always have a Biscuit WITH APPLE BUTTER and a side of grits...(Dinner), my fav is the Roast Beef Dinner with a side of OKRA, Mashed Potatoes & Grits (no cheese), can you tell I love grits? Btw, the cornbread is sweet FYI. I will come back later to update this area as I try more and more dishes. The Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes are awesome too! Yum, dessert CHOCOLATE COLA CAKE is UNBELIEVABLE! Wow!  TIP: While you are waiting, sit in a rocker outside on the front porch and look over the ENTIRE MENU. There are so many items on BOTH menus that you need time to look it over, seriously, trust me on this.  Overall, excellent experience. I personally love Cracker Barrel and this particular location is clean, friendly and the food (so far) has been a great for myself and my family. As you can tell by my review, I am a Cracker Barrel fan. They pretty much are all the same but since I live 10 minutes away, this can be dangerous for all of us. There is no such thing as 'portioning' here so I am forced to eat the great food.... Wish me luck and hope our paths cross soon!",

Down side was dirty silverware and chunks of old dry food stuck to the bottom of multiple plates. Hoping that this was just a rare to see, I would give the restaurant another chance, but if you see repeat trends in a new dining location in Vegas it makes you not want to risk getting sick at a new restaurant. Food/service was four stars compared to other locations, cleanliness was one star. Giving this location two stars overall.",

Mind you since we had an hour to wait we looked at the menu while waiting so we knew what we wanted as soon as we were seated! So we still waited 40 mins for our meal. Because we waited so long for our food our food was cold when it came out . Just when you thought you were done waiting you have to wait in another line just to pay for your food. I love Cracker Barrel and have never had this bad of an experience at any of the other locations. This was a 2 hour dining experience ! No thank you .

I will wait a few more months before I attempt to dine in. We opt for a carry out. The server that took our order saw that we were a bit irritated already for the previous guys telling us to go in 4 different lines to place an order so he was extremely attentive and nice. Our order came out in a or 25mins. The food was extremely dry and bland. We ordered 2 chicken dumplings with sides and country fried steak. Biscuits and corn bread were dried out to the point where it gets stuck to your throat when you try to swallow it. The portion of chicken and dumplings was half the size it usually is in the Midwest locations that I'm use to. Definitely wait a couple months before coming to this spot.",

Normally I don't go right in a new restaurant opening because there is so much chaos however we couldn't wait.  So we went of course as I knew there would be a wait one hour and fifteen minutes however it was worth the wait, we kept busy looking around the store bought a few items the time went quickly. One hour and ten minutes later we were called spot on time they seem to be very good at judging their times.   We came in on the fifth day of the opening this place was packed. All the employees were very upbeat smiles eager to help even with all that was going on the employees would take time to make sure you were comfortable and could help you in any way.   We were seated server came over right away introduced her self with a beautiful smile very positive attitude her name was Sarai R. Even though she was very busy she came by checking on everything food coffee etc. she did an excellent job we could not have been happier with the food and service.   Even though it was the fifth day and the restaurant section was moving like a well oiled machine the corporate staff ( red shirts) were working harder than any I have ever seen no one missed a move if something needed to be done it was done it didn't make any difference if it was your job or station or not it was it was taken care of by every employee regardless of station.  I n my forty years in the food service industry I have seen very few openings this smooth  Thank you for a job well done. To all employees THANK YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE. Will see you in the future.

You would be amazed at what a long wait time does to people's temperament, and yet, the management and staff handled every complaint with poise. I have been and have seen management \"told off\", yelled at, and slandered for things entirely out of theirs or the staff's control. (ex. The online wait system that is run and managed outside of our jurisdiction) The people who work here are really phenomenal and made the job worth going to. Next time you attempt to trash this establishment, remember that you are dealing with people. Actual people, who despite many setbacks(our restaurant and kitchen being one of the smallest in the company) still open and close that place every day without anything catching fire. I will patronize this store as long as I live in Las Vegas.",

I wandered around the retail store as it was hot outside. I was standing by the food items CB sells that they also serve in the dining room. A retail employee named Kathy approached me and asked if I had questions about the food merchandise. WOW, was this lady knowledgeable about every product we discussed, and even had tips about what goes best together. Next thing I know, my name is being called and I have a vast knowledge about the retail food than I did before my interaction with Kathy! I went to the host stand and I was immediately seated. The dining room was packed with parties of every size. Lisa took good care of me. She was prompt in coming to my table and then bringing my sweet tea. I ordered the Sunday special which is yummy boneless fried chicken. My sides were Hash brown casserole and mashed potatoes. It was excellent. Oh, plus corn muffins, too. A manager stopped by my table and checked to make sure my meal was good, my only negative comment is the noise level is very loud. I am happy CB has made it to Las Vegas! I will be back!!!",

After admiring them for a couple of minutes, this nice lady named Ann came over and asked us if we'd been helped yet, but we were still deciding what to eat, so she left. A couple of minutes afterwards, a really friendly dude name Ronnie or something came and took our orders. I ordered what I usually get from Cracker Barrel (a hamburger) and the rest of my family (four people in total) ordered. Literally less than ten minutes later our food and drinks came out, and it was still nice and warm and everything was just great. The biscuits are SOO good and warm and gosh they're just wonderful. Also, Ronnie was really fast at bringing refills. My whole family loved their food, and we're DEFINITELY coming back some time soon! Maybe we'll even bring friends!",

While we waited they brought in 2 big water misting fans! That made the wait outside a little nicer.  We are for sure going back soon.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Cracker Barrel, but the experience we had today at this location was just bad. I was surprised and disappointed. Our service was bad and the food was bad. We had to flag down waitresses for everything - they didn't give us straws for drinks (kids drinks have kids so needed straws), didn't bring water even after a second request (my husband never got a water throughout the entire meal) didn't bring the sides that came with the meals, put the country gravy on the fried shrimp instead of on the mashed potatoes (fried shrimp smothered with country gravy is disgusting if you ever wondered), and the list goes on. We pretty much had to ask for everything that they should have brought, and then got tired of asking so just gave up. And the food, which is usually good, was not. One waitress said they had a new person working the back and was messing everything up. Worst grits I've ever tasted. All together bad experience, and then they forgot to give us a receipt when we paid. My husband just gave up at that point. Not like back home at all.",

The restaurant was not busy with many open tables. Michael was not very attentive to us as we still waited for drinks that came with our meals. He was missing one drink and promised to get it. The food was look warm at best. A kids meal hamburger wad so overcook the hr couldn't eat it. Michael said he would replace it. We still didn't get the missing drink. The replacement hamburger was no better than the original. We asked again for the missing beverage. Michael's answer was sorry but it's so busy and it's the time of the day. What does 2:30 on Wednesday have to do with poor service. He said he would replace the cols hash brown casserole. The replacement was burned.   Michael's one of the worst servers and doesn't seen to care or enjoy his job.  We've eaten in many Cracker Barrel's and this is by far the worse. Doubt we'll be back.",

    "text": "My wife were very disappointed, going to the grand opening on Jul 25th. We arrived at 7:15pm, and waited for 1hr & 1/2. in 100 degree weather. We finally got called, we had Julian for a waiter. He took our drink and food order, that's all we saw of our waiter ,we had to wait awhile for both. Manager David Hankins came over to us, and asked us how was everything was. We told him that we were waiting awhile for our drinks and food order. He said we are still trying to work things out. It seemed like he was making excuses for his employees. When we finally got our food order, my wife's order was not right. She order, steak & steak fries. She did not receive steak fries with her steak. Since we waited so long for our order, my wife didn't want to say anything. My order was alright, I ordered the Chacker Barrel sampler. We decided to order dessert, we had more problems. They brought out my wife's dessert without mine. I asked, where is mine? They asked what did I order? I said peach cobbler. After waiting 20 to 30 minutes for our dessert, I received my peach cobbler, not what I expected. It came to me like soup! I told the manager David Hankins about my dessert, again he was making excuses for his employees. This manager, did not apologize for anything that went wrong. He didn't even offer to do anything for us, very unprofessional! He walk away saying if there's anything he can do. We should not have to tell a manager what he should do for unhappy customers! Also we notice employees standing around not helping customers . That could of been causing the wait time for people waiting for drinks & food orders. My wife & I never expected to receive the service we received. We went to a Chacker Barrel in Andover Mass and had Excellent Service and Excellent food. That's why came here, we didn't understand why we didn't get the same Service we received back east. It seems that all employees including Managers need further training on taking orders and having customers wait for a long period of time .We hope that things change around so we can come back enjoy our experience with good service and good food. It will be awhile before we try our experience again .",

    "text": "Was so excited to eat at the new Cracker Barrel. What a disappointment!!! Took the entire family of 9 there. Submitted our name for seating and they told us to be back in 1 hour and 45 minutes. We returned early in 1 hour and 15 minutes only to find out that they had given our table away and marked us off their list. They put us back on the waiting list and moved us to the front of the list but provided no apology. Had to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  Our waitress Cassie was terrible but her partner James was great. Took forever to get our drinks. We also requested water which Cassie never brought out. Our food came out in waves. No sight of Cassie.  Our drink glasses were all empty. My husband and son were just about done with their food when me and a couple of my daughters finally got ours. My youngest daughter didn't get her meal until we were all just about done eating.  The food was terrible, my food was lukewarm at best, and to top things off I found a wadded up piece of Serran plastic wrap in my vegetable medley. Yuk!!  Absolutely gross!!!! James was very apologetic and asked if he could bring me something else. The manager on the other hand just smiled and said thank you. Never an apology or inquiry with us as to what they could do better or how they could make it right.  Poor management! Poor food! And probably some of the WORSE service I've EVER received in Las Vegas or at any Cracker Barrel. Cassie finally showed back up to give us our bill but she was MIA throughout our entire dining experience.  Won't be going back!!",

    "text": "Being from Tennessee we were so looking forward to Cracker Barrel coming to Vegas, but sadly disappointed! We were fine with a 2 hour wait, we brought things to keep our 3 little ones busy because it was expected with a new place. The place was so crowded inside we couldn't get our disabled son's small wheelchair through the crowd as we were being seated, and again had problems as my husband waited 30 minutes to pay the bill. We witnessed a family get their food at totally different times while waiting 40 minutes for our food. This poor woman at the next table didn't get all her food until after her husband and daughter had finished their entire meal! It looked like managers and ladies in red shirts were bringing the food out one dish at a time (the wrong food) and when the waitress reminded one of them of what she ordered the manager snapped at her so bad we were embarrassed to have our children hear it! That waitress was trying to help the customers, nobody should treat employees like that! Our food came out cold and didn't taste like what we were used to at our old CB in Tennessee. Very sad that we can't share our good experiences with this company with our children, because we will never come back! Good luck to the rest of the waiters and waitresses, we hope you are treated better than that other waitress. Our waiter Jeremy was wonderful and kept checking on us even after giving us a bill before we could even taste our food (very weird!).",

Basically they just call your name, so you must be back to hear your name however. The wait was a lot longer than 45 minutes. We ended up finally getting called around 5:15, which was 30 minutes longer than what they told us. We walked inside and had trouble trying to get to the host/hostess desk to be shown to our table. The store area when you first enter was way too crowded. Then we had to stand there for a couple minutes while they got the table ready. We finally got to our table and the place is extremely loud. The waitress was very nice and did a good job. They took our order quickly, however, again, we waited almost an hour for our food to arrive. The food was just ok, nothing to rave about. My wife's eggs weren't cooked enough and were runny, so we had to send them back. By the time we finished eating and were leaving, we had spent roughly 3 hours for dinner. Probably won't be returning.",

First off the food service was very slow and she kept forgetting things. Second the food was very bland. The corn bread was the worst I have ever tasted no flavor at all! I had the signature dish country fried steak and the steak had no flavor and the white gravy was so thick I can taste the flour and it had no flavor and was very cold. To top that there was barely any gravy on my steak or mashed potatoes!! Everything I ordered tasted the same all the food was very bland! My mother-in-law had the same thing. She also had a piece of hair in her food so we told the waitress and she got the manager!! When the manager came over we told him about the hair and he stated \" ooo no I will take care of it\" all with his head down like he did not care then walked off!! He had no customer service and was very rude about it! After we got the check I went to pay and the lady behind the cashier we very nice but she asked if we had a good meal and I told her how I felt. She got the manager again and again I told him why I was not happy. I stated there was a hair in my mother food and he stopped me half way through my sentence and stated \" And I took care of that\" ( extremely rude tone) very disrespectful. I explained to the manager I am not looking for free food. Just wanted you to know so it does not happen again and furthermore Cracker Barrel has a better reputation then the service and food we receive today. Along with a manager that was respectful and understanding!! I don't think I will ever go back to that Cracker Barrel again!! Very disappointed!!",

Long story short; the wait was 60 minutes and the food didn't arrive for another 35 minutes, after that......total wait 95 minutes. Then the food arrived; I ordered the fish sandwich. The bread was not toasted and it had been sitting in some water or sauce so that the bread was all mushy....just sort of slopped on the plate with very little care. I sent it back!!!! The manager offered to go in the back and make it herself but by this time we had already spent too much time at the is place as we had other places to be. Long story short; I would avoid this place until and unless they get their \"stuff\" together I've worked in f and b all my life , every job from running the restaurants, owning them to washing the dishes so I have some back ground and experience.......... Start retraining your people from scratch. Stu",

I ended up choosing the blueberry pancakes. Food took longer than it should've. Weirdest pancakes I've ever had...more like griddle cakes. They seemed almost fried and were at times salty and way too buttery. Boyfriend wasn't crazy about his food either...but he did say the hash brown casserole was good.",

We asked for it to be replaced and she never came back. So we sat. Food growing colder with ever passing second. I finally went to the hostess station to get a manger, 5 minutes I waited. I brought her back to our table, we told her what was going on. She took the hubby's food but left mine. As we sat there we got more and more irritated. We decided to cut our loses and leave. This is NOT the same Cracker Barrel that we used frequent in Sturbridge, MA. Suffice to say we will never come back. It was a miserable experience.

My husbands steak was so salty he had to spit it into his napkin. His biscuit was raw dough. The pancake was burnt and his eggs were cold. My meal came out with no vegetables like i ordered, but eventually came. The chicken was so thin and dry. The vegetables were bland and over steamed. It was worse than hospital food. The food was absolutely DISGUSTING! I am so disappointed. I have heard many great things about Cracker Barrel, but after reading  these reviews it seems like everyone's having the same experience with the quality of food. The customer service is exceptional, but obviously not worth coming if you can't enjoy the taste of your meal. They did comp my husbands steak. We just paid the rest of the tab and got on. It was a first and last for me. Hopefully they can get their food up to par with some of their other locations.",

However, the food was not good at all, I ordered the chicken fried steak, it came with biscuits and gravy and very small side of hash brown. Not enough gravy, the biscuits were not good, and the chicken fried steak was previously frozen and just dropped in the deep fryer. Nothing homemade. Very disappointed. My chick ordered a bacon burger.. The fries were soft and soggy, the patty flat and dry, the only thing that was decent was the bacon. I convinced myself that this place has to have something good about it, so I ordered a chicken pot pie to go, as I'm eating right now, it's just not good.. Kinda sad because the build up for this place was exciting and the food is basically truck stop food.. Definitely not worth the hour wait.",

After a very long wait and a really rude hostess we received awful food. My sausages were hockey pucks requiring a knife to cut them, my hash browns looked like I got the last bit out of the old pan, hard and overcooked (actually burnt across the top), and the biscuits were doughy and undercooked. Everyone raves that the portion sizes are huge, but it looked like they had used an oversize plate to serve me my two tablespoons of hash browns and my eggs. It took me another 15 minutes to get the rest of my breakfast! Service was lackluster and when we said something the server just put our check on the table and walked away. I will NEVER go back to this location, I'd rather drive an hour and get better food and service! Typical \"Vegasizing\" of an otherwise amazing establishment!",

    "text": "So I don't usually give reviews however everyone needs to know about this place. We waited for over an hour to be seated. When we sat down we already knew what we wanted and placed order immediately. Somehow our order got lost so waited some more. Food arrived chicken sandwich was burnt with literally 5 fries and we asked for no mayo and of course mayo on it so now it's half a sandwich because the other bun was drenched in mayo. Silverware wrapped was dirty with food caked on it. Food orders sides for 3 people all mixed up on each other's plates. The chicken fried chicken barely had any gravy on it. On top of all that yes the manager comes over and apologizes and says she will be discounting the bill and for our troubles free dessert. Well she took $4.00 off the bill and for the dessert at first it was said get what you want then when ordering was told oh that dessert is for two people so they made us share one after saying each one of us would get a dessert. The worst Cracker Barrel experience ever. Would never go back. If you want an amazing Cracker Barrel experience you might rethink this place. Nashville is where I will go back. These people are giving Cracker Barrel a BAD reputation. The only reason one star is up is because you have to at least click on one star to get posted. So just so everyone knows my rating is a negative star",

    "text": "I'm so glad that a Cracker Barrel opened up in Las Vegas, especially on my side of town. Regardless of the fact that there is still a 45 minute wait, I love this place. Now my bf and I don't have to drive to St. George, Utah when we want CB.   You know all the food that makes America obese and is bad for you? They have it all here!! Biscuits, grits, country fried steak for breakfast and fried catfish, burgers and mac and cheese are some options offered on the menu. Breakfast is served all day and they have daily specials for lunch and dinner. The breakfast and lunch/dinner menus offer an extensive amount of sides to customize your meal.   I'm pretty basic and always opt for breakfast items. The sausage, eggs and bacon are pretty basic and nothing to write home about. So why do we keep coming back?! I love the PANCAKES and biscuits. Omg the pancake!! They are fluffy and buttery. What makes these stand out is that they cook them in a way where the edges are crispy. I freaking love it. And no matter what time of day we go, we always get the biscuits. They are warm and soft and are delicious with apple butter.   And once you are finished with your 1000 calorie meal, walk around the country store to look at all the little knick knacks and candy they have to offer. All of the employees we have encountered have been warm and friendly. And despite the longer than average wait to be seated, our food has always arrived in a timely manner.   I am definitely a fan!! Already craving another pancake!!!!",

    "text": "Most Cracker Barrel locations run about 3 stars for me. When you come here, you pretty much know what to expect when it comes to the food.  This Cracker Barrel is right next to Silverton Casino and is the first one in Vegas I believe. Due to this, and the location, this location gets PACKED!!! At one point, I got up to use the restroom and had to pass through layers of people waiting by the hostess stand.   The reason for my two star review is the cramped space, poor crowd control, lacking and very slow service!   When we were waiting to be seated, I was looking through the store. My family was waiting near the candy listening for our name. We had been told it would be 10 minutes or less to be seated. After 20 minutes or so, we finally asked how much longer. The hostess then said, \"Oh. I thought I seated you. Sorry. Just a few more minutes.\" Turns out she had skipped us. While waiting, another family came up to the stand and they too had the same issue.  After being seated, the waitress quickly took our order. Drinks came quickly. Coffee was being refilled quickly.   The food took much longer than normal for a Cracker Barrel to come out. I ordered the pecan pancakes and a side of biscuits and gravy to share. When my gravy came out, it had a film layer from sitting and my food was all just barely warm.  If you have never been to a Cracker Barrel, I would say to go. For a major chain that is in the Denny's type family to me, it's pretty good. If you have been, then I would say to skip this spot. It's way too hectic and it will probably be a letdown to you.",

    "text": "Been meaning to try Cracker Barrel since it opened here in Las. Well, the ambiance is fantastic! The fireplace was glowing and keeping everyone within 15ft. warm and cozy on this Friday morning in December. They have a checkers table nearest to the fireplace too. So I asked our hostess and server, what is the most popular item on the breakfast menu. Gramma's sampler platter - actually not on the menu -was the response. It's an order of pancakes, bacon or sausage, eggs and choice of potatoes. We chose the hash brown casserole. When I think of hash browns for breakfast, I'm thinking ... crispy. Key word here is CASSEROLE.  NO crispness at all.  Soupy ... Soggy shredded potatoes. PASS! Bacon ordered crispy as usual, bacon I got was soggy and chewy. PASS! Eggs came as ordered, over easy. BUENO! Pancakes, I love me some good crispy on the edges pancake that's yeasty and melts in your mouth. Looked great, butter was frozen and of course, hard to spread. Pancakes was a little burnt. (see pic) I didn't bring this to the attention of the staff as we needed to make an appt. No biggie, flavor was ok and the maple syrup helped. Coffee was just ok to me but remember, I'm a self appointed coffee snob. (I'm getting better tho) Perhaps if there is a next time, we'll definitely order something different. We'll be back in Las Vegas February 2018. Have a safe holiday season folks!",

We stopped in last week for breakfast; and as always, this place did not disappoint. We were greeted by the nice host who seated us within minutes. Our waitress immediately introduced herself and took our food and drink order. My boyfriend ordered the Sunrise Sampler (that comes with bacon, sausage, and ham) and I ordered the Uncle Herschel's favorite with a smoked country ham. Both meals came with all the fixins including buttermilk biscuits with gravy and your choice of fried apples or hashbrown casserole. My boyfriend and I chose the hashbrown casserole. In addition, we ordered a single pancake to share (which is one of the main reasons why we come here). Their pancakes are amazing! The edges of the pancake have this buttery crunch to it and the middle is so soft and fluffy. The best part is that the pancakes are served with a warm bottle of maple syrup. In addition, the service is on point. Our waitress always checked on us, refilled our drinks frequently, and made sure everything was made to our liking.   Cracker Barrel is a great spot for breakfast. The staff are extremely friendly and courteous. The portions are humongous and the prices are affordable. Before leaving the restaurant, we love to roam around the store and check out the goodies they have to offer- such as old school candies, chocolates, and other treats. We were amazed when we found that they sell a particular brand of corn bread chips that we once tried in Texas (and of course, we had to buy a bag). I definitely recommend this place. We will be back for sure!",

The biscuits and food is of your typical Cracker Barrel quality, which is consistently good. However, the one star is for their service. Specifically their catering service. I placed my order almost a week before in advance and was told it'd be ready at 8pm on Wednesday evening. Great; no problem. I showed up a few minutes early and paid for the food. It took another 25 minutes before I got my order. Mind you, I was told it'd be ready at 8pm. My wife and children are waiting in the car cause I was told the food would be ready at 8pm. Otherwise, I'd show up at 8:25pm. There is no sense of urgency and the workers kept telling me they were \"bagging up my order and it'll be a few minutes.\" There is ZERO accountability here and I won't be coming back. My family love Cracker Barrel but the service at this location is HORRIBLE.",

We got there about 7:10 & still had 3 before us but got in about 5 minutes.   Hubby ordered his pancakes & I got Mamma's Pancake that came with eggs & bacon that we would share. I asked if I could get Blueberry Pancakes with it-server said No Problem. Well, it was...  We waited for 15 minutes with others getting meals. Guess pancakes take longer. Got his pancakes, the eggs & bacon of my order and then got regular instead of Blueberry pancakes.  She said it was her fault & went back quickly to reorder. Hubby started on his pancakes while they were hot & we ate the eggs & 1 bacon-but they were soft-the fat was still white & the meat part was not done enough either. I asked if they would cook them a little more but no-they had to bring new ones. She was gone before I could say never mind. So more waiting :(   My Blueberry Pancakes finally came but looked like they were fried. They were so crispy hubby could hear me crunch when I ate the edge. I ate part of one & asked for a box-hoping they would be better tomorrow. The bacon came & it was HARD. So overdone that it had to be on purpose & they cut (I hope) the fat part so it wouldn't be flabby. I put a butter knife next to it in the picture & they were dwarfed!   I was SO NOT happy. We packed it up & left. There was another line to pay & hubby nicely said breakfast wasn't good to the girl at the register. She said nothing. Then I was even more not happy so asked for the manager. We waited again & could not even get a manager. We told the girl it was taking too long but explained what happened & she was nice & said she'd pass it on to the manager.   We have had ok food in other Cracker Barrels so it must be how this one is run. Go anywhere else.",

If you're on a death row list, this is the place to request your last meal.  I'm serious!!! For starters, I am no pancake fan. But the last few times here I ordered their pumpkin pancakes and holy hell, they were explosively delicious. It took me back to when my grandma would make this Mexican dessert dish, Capirotada.  If you could scratch and sniff my review it would make so much more sense. Unfortunately, you just simply have to take my word for it. Any place that has breakfast all day is welcomed in my life.  This place has it all, from breakfast and lunch to dinner. So many choices, you can't go wrong.",

Continued to seat there for well over a hour and no food no waiter no nothing. Finally flagged down someone and said something after 45mins of waiting to receive our food was told food was on the way in 4 more mins. After 15mins later the food came incorrectly and not cooked right. Had to speak with the manager 3 different times. He ended up having to give me the food for free because of how poor the service was. People who were seated 20mins after we were were leaving after they ate there food by the time we recieved our food. Couldnt believe how horrible this service was. If i could give them Zero stars i would. Never thought as much as I come to cracker barrel i would experience service this horrible. This location needs better training better management and better everything. Once we did recieve our food it was incorrect and seemed rushed and was the worst food i have recieved at any ctackel barrel.  Please be careful dealing with this location.",

Upon entering the country store and proceeding to the hostess podium, a hostess and host was standing side by side. The young man led us to our table and handed us menus. While we perused the menu our waitress greeted us. My husband ordered the Thursday special: Turkey and gravy with a choice of two sides. He chose macaroni and cheese, with green beans. For his bread, he chose biscuits. I chose the small dinner plate with fried catfish and my two sides were garden salad and pinto beans with cornbread. Our waitress brought out apple butter and margarine for our bread. Everything was delicious and delightful. We were famished so we ate mainly in silence. The pinto beans had pieces of bacon in it. This was a very tasty dish, not the usual pinto beans. Our service was excellent, the food outstanding and the restaurant/store very clean and organized. We will definitely return. It isn't that far from Henderson. I would recommend if you're seeking a good quality meal to give it a try.",

My main disappointment was my order was wrong, which made my wait even more! Like seriously it's a 50 min wait, 5min wait to take your order, 20 min wait for you food. So you can imagine why I am disappointed. To top it all off my utensil was dirty and the gal who brought out our food was overwhelmed already and said I will bring your server out- yah that never happened!  Mind you I had to wait for them to bring out my food correctly, and now that I have it, I had to wait longer for my fork. Well damn! My eggs were cold, my bacon was cold and the casserole I didn't order was cold. I give up! This place is on my monthly agenda. I need to wait to come back here, so i can forget how terrible the service is.  I informed the manager, but was ranting more about how long the wait was and how my dirty utensil was, and how I asked for regular sugar and never got it and I am still waiting for my second cup of coffee. Ugh I am just irritated on how this restaurant neglects on staying consistent!",

    "text": "Oh Cracker Barrel.   I remember being a kid LOVING going to Cracker Barrel back home in IL.  My husband has never been until this past Saturday, and I can honestly say, I doubt we will be back, especially to this location.  We've tried to come here a couple of times, and the wait times have been 45 minutes + each time.  Saturday, we got here at 7:45 am, and were seated at 7:53 am.  (This is important.)  The lady who sat us made a complaining comment about being busy (it was NOT busy yet, they had plenty of open tables, and there were only 2 couples ahead of us in line), and even said that we brought the rush with us.  Not a good start.  We had 1 person stop and ask for drink orders about 5 minutes after we were seated.   About 5 minutes after that, we had another person stop by and ask if anyone had come over yet.  Another 5 minutes (10 minutes since the water orders were taken) and we got our waters from a third person.  Then we sat and looked around for another 7-8 minutes (25 ish minutes total) until another random server came over and took our orders.   About 5 minutes later, our actual server came out and said she was sorry, she was in the kitchen, but she saw we'd gotten our orders in, and food would be out shortly.  20 minutes later, we still had no food.  I'm sorry, but what we ordered absolutely did not take 30-35 minutes to make.  People who were seated LONG after us were receiving their food.   Our server finally noticed and came over, and said she'd go and find out where our food was.    At this point, my husband and I decided that we would give it 5 more minutes and leave.  At nearly an hour, this was getting ridiculous.  Our server came back with our biscuits and grits, and said that my husband's chicken fried chicken needed another minute, but it would be out shortly.  They forgot our order and were rushing to get it out.  Chicken fried chicken does NOT take 45 minutes to make.    Food finally arrived.  We ordered:   Chicken fried chicken with hash browns and 2 over medium eggs, with grits and biscuits, gravy on the side.  Chicken came out with gravy on it, even though it was ordered on the side, but it was fine.  The gravy was good.  Chicken had good flavor.  These are the best grits I've had in town, and the eggs were ok: one was perfect, one was overcooked.  \"Uncle Hershel's favorite\":  2 over medium eggs, loaded hash brown casserole, and fried catfish, and an extra side of fried apples. Everything was good.  There was an egg shell on the plate under the eggs.  Not a huge deal, because I know an egg shell isn't going to hurt anything, but worth mentioning.  Upon paying at the cashier's desk, the same complainy old lady who seated us asked \"How was everything.\"  When I replied with a disappointed \"Alright.\"  there was no further investigation, nothing.  If you don't want to know or do anything about it, don't ask.    I'm really disappointed in this visit.  For having food that's pretty darned good, and pretty consistently good at that...the service just ruined it for me.  We 100% will not be coming back to this location for sure.    Cracker Barrel, please get yourselves organized.  Get some people who know what they're doing, who aren't going to lose people's orders, who actually give a damn about customer service.  Please.",

    "text": "Back at the turn of the millennium I was fortunate to be hanging out a lot in Upstate New York's Finger Lakes region.  I didn't know much about Cracker Barrell, being from California.  In NY, there are a few near the I-90 Tollway.  I noticed the signs and wondered about the restaurant / country store concept.  Never did make it to one there, but a seed was planted.  When in Las Vegas last week, Cracker Barrel's sign again caught my attention. Dear Hubby and I ended up taking our nephew, grandson, and another young family member to eat there.  One of the young men was not happy with my choice.  \"I don't eat that kind of (\"bland American\") food\".  Oh-kay.    Another has spent time in the South and was all for the comfort food dishes up here.  He made some suggestions, based on his previous knowledge.  The youngest member of the group just dove into a cheeseburger and fries and was quite happy.  Meanwhile, I walked in and felt instantly at home.  The country general store vibe worked for my \"Fixer Upper\" kind of decorating style.  The merchandising was arrayed by color groupings, with lots of whimsy added.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table that would fit our group of 5.  I got to browse the shop, while DH retired to the front porch to enjoy one of the wooden rocking chairs that are for lounging, but also for sale.  Once seated in the eclecticly decorated dining room, we picked our meals, then were started off with a big plate of fluffy buttermilk biscuits and also cornbread muffins.  Serious yum!    DH and I shared a sampler meal, which included chicken and dumplings, ham, and meatloaf, plus three sides. We chose corn, mac and cheese, and baked beans.  Aside from the ham being on the dry side, all else was delicious.  The dumplings were very tender and flavorful.  Even the picky eater in the bunch loved them.  I tried their Southern-style banana pudding dessert.  Loved the presentation in a Mason jar, but ultimately thought it lacked enough banana flavor to completely win me.  By the way, their simple wooden triangle game with golf tees that you jump and try to end up with only one tee remaining got all the kids off their electronics to play!  Before leaving town, I told DH I wanted to stop by again.  I ended up buying a scarf and a vest from the store.  Both had caught my eye and were very reasonably priced.  For that matter, feeding five people at dinner was also accomplished at a fair rate.  Glad to see that a Cracker Barrel is coming to Camarillo. That's a lot closer than Victorville, Vegas, or Santa Maria.",

Food:  Pancakes  Country Fried Steak with grits, eggs, toast and hashbrown casserole. The pancakes were the highlight. Delicious,  buttery and scrumptious.  The country fried steak was meh. I ate about half of it. The gravy was good but the grits were blah.  Overall, my dining experience was just alright.

    "text": "Maybe I'm expecting too much, but sadly this place and the manager, Daniel, both need a refresher class on order accuracy, customer service, and the importance of cooking food correctly. We ordered three meals, and I immediately called to ask them if they could swap all the normally included cinnamon apples for hash brown casserole. Daniel said no problem. Awesome! Fast forward to the food arriving. I unpack the bag and find 2 big containers of apples. No swapped sides of hash brown casserole after all. I call and let Daniel know. He claims it's the drivers fault (door dash) because he should have checked the meal.... that doesn't make sense because 1, door dash shouldn't be opening my food containers and 2, the change was made over the phone with Daniel himself so the driver wouldn't have known about the sides. I hang up and start to serve myself, my husband and my kids. Upon opening the meals, I realize the sausage patties are rock hard, I couldn't even give them to my toddlers. My husbands steak was requested medium rare.. it arrived black, charred, grey and hard as a rock. Cooled beyond well done for sure. I think okay, maybe we can all share my biscuits and gravy, but nope - biscuits so old and dry they crumbled to nothing and the gravy was bland and had no flavor. Bacon was cold, soft and tough. The grits were so bland and smelled like warm paper... i literally thought I was being pranked. To make it all worse - I called the restaurant to let them know the state of the rest of my meal and I was put on hold, so a manager could be located. The person on the line comes back and says \"the manager told me to tell you to call doordash for a refund\". I say that's not really how this works, since doordash didn't do anything wrong. Then she puts me on hold again and magically the line disconnected. I called back, 3 more minutes on hold, and then a man, maybe Daniel, grabs the phone and says \"give me your #, I'll refund you after lunch\". Didn't even ask who I was. I wonder how he knew it was me, because if they do have caller ID, it's pretty shady that they didn't return my call after they hung up.",

    "text": "Delicious place for classic, simple, American comfort country cooking.  The dining area is like a country home with a large working fireplace that will be in use during cooler times (if such exist in Vegas) and lots of country, farm decor on the walls with simple wooden tables.    The menu has breakfast all day plus plenty of hearty country cooking along with daily specials.  Tip: Come on Sunday for the homestyle fried chicken.  Two large boneless breasts with an amazing buttermilk breading.  Indulgent but excellent and juicy.  I also love the chicken and dumplings.  A hearty portion of chicken breast pieces with dumplings in a chicken gravy.  Simple, nothing fancy, and very tasty.  It comes with three sides.  I like the green beans (served country style with ham), carrots (simple and unadorned), and French fries (thinner now - I miss their old thick steak fries).  Ask for the biscuits with the meal (better than the cornbread I think) and try some of their \"apple butter\" to spread on top.  Amazing!    Leave room for dessert!  The chocolate Coca-Cola cake is something else and not to be missed.  I don't think I have tasted a moister or fudgier cake in my lifetime.  They actually use Coca-Cola in the cake; maybe this is what makes it so moist.  The fudge icing is also unbelievable.  Decadent but worth it for a treat.  The baked apple dumpling is also excellent.  It's bigger and more decadent but also amazing.  This most recent time we tried their seasonal dessert - a buttermilk pie.  A very delicious custard pie topped with strawberries.  Less decadent than the above choices but still excellent.  Don't expect gourmet fare here, but it you stick with their country favorites you will likely have a very satisfying meal!  PS - Service is always very good as well!",

The food was baby approved!  We were pretty much seated right away and in a corner, which was good for our little distracted eater :)  There were lots of menu options, so we had to ask our server some recommendations!   I forgot the name of my fried chicken dish, but I got it with a side of Mac n cheese. You get a choice of cornbread or biscuits, stick with the biscuits. The cornbread was underwhelming and dry.   They really leave you to dine and enjoy your meal without being rushed. You pay in the front store area. The store itself has cute items for purchase, most of it cute home items or random things you could purchase as a gift.",

We get their commercials in HI, but don't have any of the restaurants so I was excited to try it out in Vegas when we had the option. Very busy place! I had the Grilled Chicken BLT with Vegetable Soup. It was ok I guess. I didn't finish either. The coffee was good & refills were plentiful. I ordered the Banana Pudding for dessert but it was disappointing. It looked larger in the photo & was shown served in a cute Mason jar. The one I got was served in a small water glass. The store was my favorite with the nostalgic candies, clearance items & adorable kids clothing.  I will probably eat here again should the opportunity arise. Mahalo Kona for the fabulous service!",

    "text": "For a national chain this place can be so inconsistent.  On Sundays I make it a point to get the sunday homestyle chicken.  Ever since I've been coming to Cracker Barrell for at least 5 years and almost always order it.  I've had it in several different cities and states and it has been more or less consistent.  This one last time everything was off and it was the Las Vegas Dean Martin Drive location.  I was so shocked service was not great, neighboring guests were chewing out the servers and managers about receiving cold food they waited for forever.  Even our biscuits were not as fluffy but seemed like they were microwaved.  The homestyle chicken was so drastically different than the other handful of times I've had it I swore that they completely changed the recipe.  After that I stated that I've had my fill of Cracker Barrell and won't need to return for a while.  Then, by chance we go back to give them a second chance the homestyle chicken was like it used to be, thank goodness.  Service is still....standard.  I'll try the breakfast one of these days as well",

Not sure what was going on with our server, but she dropped the ball on many occasions during our visit. My friend had to ask for biscuits, when they should have been brought to the table with butter and/or honey right away. Biscuits were finally brought during the latter part of our meal. My one friend never got a refill on her tea until asked about it at the end. I got a coffee refill near the end. Was told by another server that our server \"had an emergency\" and this new server would be checking on us. Old server shows up again a bit later. Huh?  Food, because I was hungry, hit the spot. Scrambled eggs were passable, hot apple slices were good, bacon & sausage just okay. Coffee tasted fine.  Overall customer service from hostesses/hosts and cashiers was excellent. Our waitress could've been more attentive.  Maybe I need to try Craig Road location and compare.",

This is specifically aimed at the customer service of the process that was splitting a check 4 ways. We proceeded to the checkout, asked to split the bill 4 ways. Not evenly by amount, but by item ordered which should be a relatively simple task.  Sabrina was on the register & from the beginning it was an absolute disaster. First of all, her attitude about splitting the bill was ridiculous. She was rude & short with us. She wanted us to take a sharpie & put either a dot, \"x\", or initial by each item each person ordered which was bizarre. But we obliged.   She couldn't figure out how to ring us up after we did that, and another woman came over to help. She proceeded to print off separate checks based on who sat at which seat, which makes more sense.  But still didn't work.  When I tried to pay for my food, it wasn't correctly split by seat and had additional items that other people in our party ordered. When I pointed this out, she was condescending & said \"that's why I asked exactly what you ordered.\" Which by this point I had clearly stated multiple times.   Another woman came over to help. Three people trying to figure out how to split the freaking bill. No one in my party had paid for anything at this point & we had been at the register for over 10 minutes.   Finally, Brandon came over & it got settled. But that was absolutely ridiculous the attitudes & amount of time it took to pay for our food.   Hard pass. Go to a different location or train your employees not to suck.",

    "text": "01/11/19 Crackle Barrel is one of my husband's favorite comfort food restaurant to go. I had a good experience at their chain in Mississippi. This time we're eating here in their Vegas location...would it be any different?  I don't know if it's by design but this location is reminiscent of the one in Mississippi...corner lot with lots of parking space. I believe that's always a plus. The front of the restaurant is lined with rocking chairs for sale...oh it's not just a restaurant, it's a country store!  As you go in, their quaint shop with novelty items, apparel, candies, jams, something you'll expect a country store will have.   We were seated promptly and the interior is homey. They got friendly staff and our server was a sweet young lady. I decided to have grilled pork chop with a side of Mac and cheese and coleslaw while my husband had chicken fried chicken with side of hash brown casserole, fried apple, and dumpling.  I've tasted my husband food and it was good. It is what comfort food is all about...tasty, filling, and gives you the \"hits the spot\" feeling. My husband enjoyed.  My grilled pork chop, though the sides are ok, was dry, unseasoned bordering tasteless..just a sad looking meat on my plate. It tasted \"old.\" The corn bread seemed to have been reheated, it was stale. But my tummy needed to be happy so not much food was wasted, thanks to catsup and sweetened ice tea.  Crackle Barrel in my opinion may be a hit depending on what you order. Go for the usual comfort food or the old time favorites like chicken fried steak or meatloaf. It may be a miss when you deviate but how will you know what's really good?  We will still come back here...it maybe 3 1/2 now but it's worth going back for.",

We were told ahead of time the wait would be \"about 40 minutes.\"  Ten minutes later we arrived at the restaurant and put our names on the wait list.  Nobody said anything about a longer wait time,  70 minutes later, we asked what was going on, since we were close to 2x the wait time that we were told.  The guy at the front looked at our name on his iPad and he said, \"your wait time is shown as 'about 2 hours.'\"   I get that any restaurant can only seat a certain number of people each day and that large parties are hard to accommodate.   But, if CB told us on the phone it would take 2 hours, we would have found another place to eat.  It is totally unacceptable for a restaurant to quote one wait time and then fail to inform us that this time had actually TRIPLED.  Not going back here.",

The yolk and white of my over medium eggs flowed like a beverage.   We all thought that there was something wrong with the sausage as it refused to be cut and chewed.  The replacement gave us the same challenge.  It was dry and tough but at least warmer.  One diner had to wait more than 7 minutes for 2 little bottles of syrup.  The biscuits were tinier than most Cracker Barrels.  We had to beg for refills on ice tea and soda.  The manager was sorry.  I think we definitely were sorrier.  I was so excited that we finally had a Cracker Barrel here.  I'll continue to go to Kingman.",

    "text": "The service was great hence the 2 stars but the food not so much.  The \"meat\"loaf seemed a bit raw except for the outer edge and I put meat in quotes because I'm not too sure how much actual meat was in it. Needless to say, for me I found it to be inedible and was left on my plate.  The corn muffin was dry and tasteless lacking that sweet cornbread flavor.  The waitress must have known because she brought us some apple butter to go with them.  I mistakenly ordered the cornbread stuffing (wish I had the muffin before I ordered) because it too was very dry and crumbly.  Thankfully the corn and mashed potatoes were okay.  Now the little Country Store connected to the restaurant is another story; it is fun to check out all the old school candy.",

    "text": "The tables here are very, very close to each other. Uncomfortably close. The kerosene lamps on the tables are somewhat large and they are permanently fixed to the table which presents a problem since they have wonderful food that comes in really large portions. So it was a bit annoying trying to juggle the dishes with the limited amount of space on the tables. Not to mention it was annoying having this big lamp in between me and the rest of my family as we were trying to talk to each other. As for the food, the meal I had was excellent. I had the Haddock fried fish which was awesome. I would have enjoyed it even more if during the whole meal I wasn't trying not to bump into the person behind me.  That person had a child on their lap and I could tell they were also trying not to bump into me as well. The rest of my family was 50/50 on how they liked their meals. My daughter's kid's meal burger was very, very dry. She hated this place. So, I had to hear here complaining the whole time about how she didn't like how people kept bumping her chair.  I think their opinions of their meals were a bit skewed by the fact that they were uncomfortable because of how close the tables were. For the price of food and the wait times, I would probably not come back just cause I like to be comfortable when I eat. This is disappointing because honestly the staff at this location was super nice and extremely helpful.",

We told the lady that we had 9 people (not everyone had arrived yet so we knew we would be waiting a bit anyway) and she said it would be a 35 minute wait. That was fine because it gave everyone else a chance to get here. Finally everyone arrived and we ended up having an extra person, so I went up to the podium and let them know that we needed to add an extra person (so we had 10 people total). I watched the girl change the number from 9 to 10 and then asked how long it was gonna be and she said an additional 15 to 20 minutes. We continued waiting  and then they finally called our name. We went up to the podium and they said that we had changed from 6 to 10 (which was not True) and they only had a table for 6 available, and when we said \"no, we had 9 and changed to 10\" they were able to get us a table for 4 as well, so we said that was fine. They went to seat us at the tables, but they were far apart from each other. This was not gonna work for us because we are all family and needed to be together. So we told them that we would wait for the table for 10 but then they then said it was going to be another 20 to 25 minutes for the table. We were outraged so we left because this should not have happened. This was terrible service! Do not come here with large groups of people!!!!!",

    "text": "First time at a cracker barrel and have always heard great things about it. Went to opening day at this Vegas location since I was there on vacation for my birthday and all I have to say is AMAZING!  When you first walk up you see 2 long rows of rocking chairs on the front porch to sit at while you wait and is so inviting and homey feeling. When you walk in it takes you to the store where you can purchase items and check in to the restaurant. Since it was opening when I went yesterday it was busy BUT worth the wait. They said about an hour wait but only waited 30 minutes so in the waiting time I rocked my way on the front porch until they called our name.   When I got to restaurant portion it was so neat with country feel and signs and decor everywhere. They serve breakfast all day but I had dinner since it was dinner time. I got their grilled marinated chicken tenderloins with 3 sides that you get pick from a nice list to choose from. My three sides I picked were Mac n cheese, broccoli and mixed green salad and some biscuits. It was delicious!!!! Portion sizes are perfect size and the prices are good as well. I even caved and got a peach cobbler for dessert. For my drink I had a raspberry lemonade and it was so good it was like candy.  Our waitress was pleasant and so was the staff. The manager came by to check how we were doing and our experience. All the staff were friendly and came by to help. Over all the experience was AMAZING and they did a wonderful job for opening day. Keep it up and can't wait for one to come to California!!",

We enjoyed that they offer a sling for car seats; that made it more comfortable to watch our little one. The food was about what I expected. It wasn't the most phenomenal, but it wasn't bad either. Just some nice, simple, comfort food. I'm only docking stars because I thought the dumplings would have been a little bit better, but they seem very mass produced. Mine also had a fairly large clump of \"dumplings\" stuck together. Also the cornbread was not sweet like you expect cornbread to be. It was almost like the mix was off. Other than that everything else was great. I suggest the biscuits over the cornbread though. They taste like they are made with a stick of butter each. Paula Deen would be proud.",

I ordered a meal and I got orange juice with black little things that look like nats. When I got my meal it was not the way I ordered it. Then they took half back and the other half of my order got cold and when they brought my meal back  the eggs were all watery and they weren't as I ordered them. Then when I was about to eat my toast I asked for them to be toasted extra and was slightly Brown on one side I said okay and I turned it over it was all mushy. The entire breakfast was wrong and took forever. I spoke to a manager and all he said was I'm sorry tapped the chair and walked away. Whaaaaat really!!!! I wish I can attach a photo of the guy bussing the tables. He stood by the people eating with all the dirty dishes just waiting for someone to get up you don't stand there with dirty dishes and waiting in the middle of everybody. Then when I left I asked to speak to the manager other than the one I spoke to they said okay. Who came out??? The same manager and he asked well we we reordered everything we custom made it for U. I told him I didn't appreciate him saying I'm sorry and tapping the chair and walking away not even offering a free meal a percentage off or coming the meal for the inconvenience of me being late to work. He said well I'll take care of it like he was angry with me. What heck really?!?!?!  Not an inviting place at alllllllll!!!!! I will be taking my business to the other location on Craig.",

Got there 10:20 am checked in and the hostess outside said it would be 15 min wait. 20 mins passed. Asked the hostess inside and said it would be another 10 mins. Another 30 mins passed and we were finally called to be seated. Overall I'd say the 50 min wait was fine compared to the hour and 45 mins the other people had to wait who didn't check in online. However they do need to update the website wait time. The hostess outside was super sweet. The hostess inside, Maka... she was ok, but I sensed her irritated vibes. Understandable considering people checking in were a bit hostile. Not everyone but there were a few that I seen. Though she could of put a smile on here face since she is the first person we interact with.  * My tip would be is to arrive early say 6 or 7 to avoid the crazy wait *   FOOD : *We ordered our food at 11:10 and got our food at 11:40* Anywhere I dine for breakfast I usually tend to get either eggs Benedict or country fried steak. So when I saw Grandpa's Country fried breakfast I knew had to get it. My dish overall was pretty good. Although I do feel like the gravy needed some sprucing up and it lacked a little flavor. The fried steak was good but that also needed some seasoning. Grits were yummy. The fried apples ... mmm... the fried apples! If fall had a flavor, that bowl of fried apples would be it! The apple butter was divine on the biscuits. My husband got The Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast w/ steak. His steak was cooked perfectly. He really enjoyed his meal. We got our boys blueberry pancakes that came with blueberry syrup. They devoured them.   OVERALL ... Everything was good minus the wait for seating and food. I feel once the hype of cracker barrel finally being in Vegas dies down we would come back to dine. We love the store part of the restaurant! So many good finds there! Old school candy, games, home decor. I can go on and on. I really recommend the store to anyone who adores anything country chic stuff. I'd also like to point out that the employees there are tremendously kind. Minus the hostess inside i mentioned before.",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel, we were excited to see that this arrived in Las Vegas. We had this before when we were in Indiana and it was just good ol traditional American breakfast. It was a wonderful experience in the Midwest, but out here it's meh...  Out in the Midwest some chains are real good as well as the experience, but that's because they been doing it for years. When they bring it out here in the West people get excited, but  it's all hyped up the experience and is not the same.   Just like your typical popular restaurants and chain out here expect to wait up to 1-2 hours depending when you arrive in the morning. We arrived at 7:15am on Sunday and we still had to wait 30 minutes. Once we left it was 8:50am and we over heard the wait was two hours or so...   The food was decent and service was so so. Like I said it just open and of course it is going to take sometime until they have all the cogs working in unison. We had some eggshell residue on our eggs, we did bring it up to management so they know. They did offer to give new batch of eggs, so that was good of management to try to rectify the issue that had occurred.  They also have mini store in the front, it will be very crowded, seeing there plethora of people waiting so they are just walking around site seeing until called upon. Once done the payment option is very inefficient. You have to pay your tab while waiting in line with the rest of people shopping at the mini shopping center. So it can take a while.  To be honest with you it's not worth the wait and crowd to have to wait just for bacon, eggs, grits and other breakfast items typically served everywhere else. We ate at the Cracked Egg and it was exceptional breakfast almost similar to Cracker Barrel. I'm sure there are plenty more breakfast joints, but we thought we try out Cracker Barrel because we had a great experience dining and customer service out in the Midwest.  We probably will not return to this place, seeing how saturated it is with hype and people wanting to eat there.",

But after the server brought my food...disappointed. The kitchen was unable to accommodate my request to sub for the marinated chicken. The portions were significantly less than other locations in AZ and UT. I was expecting that same quality and taste, but I was very disappointed. The rice was hard and didn't care for the flavor. I'm even considering a drive up to Utah to get my fix...you might find me there next weekend. The service is less than average but I'm guessing it's because of the recent opening and the crowds of people eating here.",

Couldn't wait to have breakfast with my dad and reminisce.   It being opening week, I knew it would be a LONG, CROWDED wait!! Came prepared for that. What I was not prepared for was (once we were seated)  1. Waiting 25 min JUST for our coffees  2. Having the kitchen tell us they are OUT OF GRITS....AFTER our food was brought out!!! That's 80% of the reason we chose Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Those grits are amazing and I CANNOT eat biscuits, gravy, casserole, etc due to food allergies. Maaaaany others in the restaurant were pissed as well. Manager came an apologized, but too little too late.  3. Getting our side orders of food AFTER we got our bill...what? Server was completely confused the entire time.  I'm really hoping to amend my review next time I come. I'll chalk it up to opening jitters this time.",

Today I called to cash in on my free meal and explained to the person who took my order and the person who gave me my food the order was free because they messed up my order yesterday.  Get home and, wouldn't you know, missing food again.  This time I turned around and went back up there to get it and now I'm at home eating cold ass eggs.  I grew up on Cracker Barrel and have never dealt with suck crappy service and a lack of attention to detail.  Bottom line, I'll be going back to egg works for breakfast.  It's not worth it to make multiple trips for what ends up being subpar, cold food.  Until they get their operations together, I won't be back.",

    "text": "So I came here on opening day.....great idea right? Not really, but a friend wanted to go so we went!   We were told it would be about a 2 hour wait and were seated in about an hour and half. They were turning tables pretty quickly. What else is there to expect going on opening day? Not to mention opening week. If you plan on coming, then expect a wait for the next week or two at least!! If you complain about the wait, you're a new kind of special.   The place was packed to say the least, both the store and the restaurant. The seating area outside was pretty packed as well but as they turned tables it slowly got less and less packed. I think people came in waves lol   After we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who had a member of the training staff with her (red shirt) and she took our drink order. It didn't take any longer than expected for the drinks to come out. We noted that the tables were cleaned up pretty quickly for another party to be seated.   The service overall was pretty good, they had people coming around checking on tables to make sure the drinks were filled and what not. The assistant managers were checking on tables to make sure people were happy, etc. It's to be expected for opening day. They probably had double the staff on hand working and training.   I ordered unsweetened ice tea which is pretty much the same where ever you go. The rest of our table had sweet tea, orange 'n cream, and apple cider. The drinks were all on point. I'm not a huge fan of apple cider because I can never find ones that I like, but their apple cider is on point! The sweet tea wasn't overly sweet, which was good for me but my friend likes it extra sweet so she dumped another two packs of sugar into it!   Our table had Chicken and dumplings platter, rainbow trout dinner plate, and the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast. We all shared a bite to see what everything tasted. The difference between the platters and dinner plate is the size of the entree and an extra side. I got the rainbow trout  with corn and mashed potatoes. It wasn't anything special but good none the less. I just wanted something light and not heavy like the rest of the foods. I tried a bite of the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast and that was nice and moist. The Chicken and dumplings were on point as well. We didn't have anything bad but nothing was THAT great to me but nothing was bad either.   This was the first time I've ever been to a Cracker Barrel restaurant and it wasn't a bad experience at all. I definitely want to try their breakfast and a few other items that caught my attention.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of this restaurant, since I heard this place has very long wait times. My family and I have been waiting to come here for months now. However, I was really disappointed in most aspects of this business, mostly in respect to the food and the service.  Atmosphere: Awesome place. I love the decorations and the country theme. At the back of the menu, there was a story of the origins of Cracker Barrel, which I found super cute. I am not sure if it's True, but I like the idea when people were done with the stuff inside the barrel they used the barrel to play games (ex. chess) on top. The best thing I got from this experience was the mini game at our dining table. This game involved jumping pegs. The goal is to have one peg left. I generally love logic puzzles, and I played this game throughout breakfast (because of the long wait time and horrible food). I even bought it at the store next door, so I can figure the game out. This game seriously made my breakfast better.   Service: We got there once it opened for breakfast and was seated immediately when we arrived. I was surprised that there were so many people there already since the place opened up 5 minutes prior. Once we got seated, everything went downhill. It took 20-30 minutes for a server to even come to us for our orders, and we even saw other tables getting frustrated because they were also attempting to place their orders. Once we finally placed our orders, it took them a very long time to give us the food. Maybe it's too early in the morning for people to work? Oh maybe, they really want to replicate the Southern attitude by being slow (I am being mean since they were rude to us). On top of that, our waiters gave us the wrong dishes, dishes that we did not order. When we told them their mistakes, they just apologized and did not try to correct their mistakes, except for the incorrect eggs. I guess they don't want generous tips. My dad also thought people were borderline racist, especially the manager who said hello to all the tables in the restaurant who had white families, except for us. But I have no proof of this. I can forgive bad service, if the food was decent.....  Food: Two words - bland and dry. Not sure how they turned food that I really enjoy into these dishes. I can make better these dishes better even though I am not a cook. I ordered Grandpa's dish (biscuits and gravy with fried chicken). Besides the gravy (which was the BOMB) and the eggs (tasted like eggs), everything including the hash, fried chicken, and biscuits were pretty horrible. I also requested the special butter they had for the biscuits. They were jam-like, and we did not see how the biscuits and that \"butter\" went together. I honestly prefer real butter or just a regular berry jam over this concoction. I ate one bite of each of my food, lost my appetite for food, then played my logic puzzle game. McDonald's was honestly way better than this. Denny's would have one Michelin star and Black Bear Diner will have two Michelin stars if other restaurants have to be compared to this place.   Overall, the food and service are LESS than alright. I am not sure why the wait time is so long, maybe it's for the dinner which we haven't tried. This is a prime example of an overrated place. My family and I are pretty scarred from this experience and probably won't ever come here again, even if they paid us to. Hmmmm....maybe if they paid us to...but I probably only order the eggs (which they probably will get my order wrong and it will take more than an hour to even get) and gravy to-go.  Recommendation: Save your valuable time and go to Egg Works. You won't be disappointed. I come to Las Vegas 4X a year, and all the locals know about this place.  Update: They were not very good at making the food look decent. Just imagine the individual components that you get on a plate. TA DA.",

The food is amazing. I don't think there's anything on the menu that I haven't tried -- and there's not a single thing I hate. The portions are satisfying; you will definitely need to loosen up your belt after leaving.   My usual meal: meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes, mac 'n cheese, & sweet carrots. Don't tell my mom, but I prefer Cracker Barrel's meatloaf over hers.   My favorite part about Cracker Barrel is the customer service. Whoever did the hiring has done an exemplary job.   Everyone does an amazing job but my friends and I get excited when Lynette serves our table. She has a contagious smile and always remembers our names/orders -- which makes us feel at home. And whenever we bring someone new to the Cracker Barrel experience, she always takes the time to explain the menu and offer suggestions.",

Personable and jovial, we hope everyone gets a chance to have her as a server at some point.",

This store is much smaller than the others. The wait times are lengthy. The food is great. Service could be better. Get rid of this rectangular serving trays and get the ovals with some tray jacks! The servers also need to be able to be able to cash people out. This will eliminate the long lines in the store.   We just weren't impressed. Sorry folks, gonna have to give them a few months to work out the kinks before I try it again!",

I went on a Monday mid morning and still had to wait 45 minutes when told it would be 15 min.       The store style is very cozy to entertaining with all the stuff displayed throughout the store and restaurant.     I feel this place is still going through opening pains. Service started out ok but seemed to lack any enthusiasm. And we ended up having to ask for refills as they passed by follow up was very poor.      The menu had alot of choices from lunch and breakfast menus. And prices seemed to be on track with other local restaurants. 9-15 dollars ..      The food was a big let down.. I do not know what the rant is.. The food was very bland,  portions where ok at best. the biscuits and corn bread where so dry not even butter and jam could spare them. I had meat loaf as part of my meal and it tasted like cheap hamburger meat with out anything else.. The chicken and dumplings where a big lump on the plate not at all like I know them to be.. had the consistency of mac and cheese which I also got which where gritty..          I'm very let down from this visit, I might give them another try in the future but right now I will stay away.. Over hyped for the value, wait is way to long for what you get and bland food..",

One of us ordered and steak, and it was noticeable that it wasn't even cooked on a grill but on a flat pan; meaning it was very dry. Not to mention, he ordered medium done and it was well done.   After addressing some of these issues, our waitress stated that it was because their cooks were working very slow back there. ?????? Oh.   I have to say, our waitress was very nice and accommodating, but the cooks and food runners need to work together to provide appetizing meals.

    "text": "What pulled this review out of negative territory was the excellent service, decor, and ambiance. If I could solely grade the menu items my review would be minus two. While Cracker Barrel is certainly in the hospitality business they are not in the food and restaurant business. I have dined at this location twice and both times were abject FAILS. I sampled the regular menu fare (we ordered many items off the menu) during my first visit and proclaimed it the worst meal I can recall at a 'restaurant.' My other daughter wanted to try Cracker Barrel so I reluctantly went back and this time thought I couldn't go wrong ordering off the breakfast menu. Second worst meal during a lifetime of dining and just as abominable as the first. If Wonder bread has a cousin they serve it at Cracker barrel. The toast was thin and highly processed. Like cotton candy, it starts dissolving in your mouth before you can chew. I had to send the 'French toast' back (trust me, the French want no part of this toast charade). The kitchen used the same Wonder bread wannabe and fried it in (what I can only guess) some sort of bland highly processed vegetable oil--the kind the FDA is constantly warning you about. How is it possible to ruin elementary-level French toast? The eggs were serviceable and passed muster. Our wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating, the decor delightfully retro-themed, and the background music scored major points. A perusal through the well-stocked gift shop and a leisurely recline in the comfy rocking chairs outside took the edge off of what would have been a disastrous dining experience. We stopped at a pizza place on the way home for some takeout so I could have a meal before retiring. Perhaps it is the transiency of their customers that drives the low standards of this particular Cracker Barrel. They could (and should) do so much better.   Many have complained about the long wait. A wait is almost always worth it if the food is good. There is nothing to wait for at Cracker Barrel so it would behoove you to mosey on to one of many fine dining options in Las Vegas.   To the chef at Cracker Barrel: how *is* it possible to ruin French toast and just about everything else on the menu?  This is simple, comfort food...not much to mess up. I do have a suggestion: jack up the prices (they are way too low) and use higher quality victuals.",

Your better off going to Black Bear Diner a few minutes drive away or Denny's or IHOP. Oh yeah and over priced too a kids breakfast not including a drink was about $4.50 for a small azz pancake just one pancake not even medium sized. The same price for a yogurt parfait, I could've got a better meal at McDonalds for cheaper",

(Biscuits and gravy, apples, hash browns) when she finally brought out the rest of my order that was already cold (eggs and ham) were now dried out even more and almost unfit to eat. For $27.00 for breakfast and having to wait a long time for the meal to arrive (and it wasn't busy) I didn't enjoy it at all. I've traveled and ate Cracker Barrel all over the states and never had a bad meal until now, what a disappointment, I will not be returning.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to the Cracker Barrel for breakfast today. We arrived at 9:00 am om a Saturday and there was no wait! The place was busy and by the time we left there was a long line at check in. There was a roaring fire in the fireplace and that was welcome on a super cold morning.   The place seems to be well staffed with what appeared to be more than one manager walking around to check on tables. However, they would walk by and mumble \"is everything ok?\" and they were gone. So, really there was no opportunity to say anything other than \"fine\". They should have slowed down to listen to their customers like they were actually interested if everything was satisfactory.   Our waitress arrived quickly to take our orders. My husband and I both ordered breakfast combos. My husband asked to substitute an item and the waitress seemed confused if this was a possibility, so he said forget it.   Our food came in about 15 minutes and it was pretty darn cold! I would have told the manager, but he walked by so fast I wasn't able. Cold food is the worst! The hash brown casserole was under-cooked and the potatoes were crunchy. The gravy tasted like a fireplace or liquid smoke. Which is weird. We asked to have it replaced because it was not eatable. The waitress happily brought another one and it was still very funny tasting.   Despite all the managers on duty \"checking\" with customers, no manager came to check on our complaint or returned food. This is also weird.   Finally, when I went to pay I asked the cashier if I could leave my cash tip for my server at the front (I needed change) because our table was all the way across the restaurant. She looked confused starting bumbling around a bit and I said never mind and walked it back myself.   Overall, not a great experience, It is unlikely we will return.",

But i never expected to not want to come back here after my meal. Cracker Barrel was never a place i looked to for a fine dining experience, but more like a hearty meal that was offered on the cheap and didn't taste too bad at the same time. Without going into detail on the already mentioned, horrible service, tasteless cold food, and not worth the efforts of the wait. Ill just chalk it up to saying there are far better options with the same price points and far better service and food, and within a reasonable radius of this location as well. Think twice about waiting in the heat for 45-60 minutes to eat sub par food, as its likely you will leave with disappointment.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever. While I consider Cracker Barrel mediocre to begin with , this was the 3rd and LAST TIME I will be visiting the particular one. We were seated promptly and the place was only 1/3 full. We ordered our drinks and waited about 15 minutes for those , ordered our food another 20 minutes for that. There were 3 servers walking around the room but we could not get anyones attention. Our servers name was Cody and after we ordered food , we never saw him again unless we flagged down someone else to help us out. The food came and my wifes side salad never did come , until we looked for and asked a server not our own , because he,Cody, never came around. We got the salad right as we were finishing our meal and there was pieces of black rotting lettuce on there as well. We waited about a half hour with empty drinks and we had been eating with nothing to drink. I was ready to go to the Wait staff side station and get my own drinks. I was finally able to get the attention of a bus person and asked if we could get some more teas. 10 minutes , no Cody still in sight and no drinks. Meanwhile Cody comes by 5 minutes after that with our bill. Never even asked us if we wanted any thing else (like dessert) before giving us our check. I told him we had been waiting 20 minutes with not 1 refill for our small glasses of tea that were all ice anyways. He said he would bring us some. 10 minutes later the teas show up. At that point we just asked for 2 to go boxes and 2 to go drink containers. 10 minutes later the boxes show up with no drink containers. Now mind you , all the while , 3 managers were walking around laughing and joking amongst themselves and small talking certain customers for 10 minutes. While I looked around the room , there were other angry customers trying to get someones attention also. None of those managers ever came our way though. After being tired of waiting for the to go drink containers , we guzzled the only refill we had in over an hour , which again was all Ice and hardly any tea. We boxed our food up and as we left we told 3 seperate employees that was the worst service we had ever had anywhere. We were also very polite with everyone we spoke to. ALL the servers seemed to have a careless attitude in the room as well. Maybe that is why there were 3 mangers walking around !! Possibly damage control ? Cody got a 25 cent tip and if I could give this location ZERO STARS I would. The Craig Rd by the 15 fwy location has far better service !! This place SUCKS !!! Terrible service all around , the food was serioulsy lacking in flavor and presentation as well !!",

Came here on a Friday late afternoon, no line, not busy. Host greeted us and sat us fairly quickly. Server came around and took our drink/food orders. I chose a dinner plate (choice of 3 sides). Took ~10 minutes for the server to come back with 2 drinks- no bread. ~10 minted later our food arrives by a different server. Missing one side, figured out server would be bringing it, since she was our server. Our server is nowhere to be found. Halfway through our meal, server checks on us. I politely ask her if I ordered a third side, since my meal comes with 3 sides. She said she doesn't have it written down but she's sure I did. Brings my third side and bread, midway through my meal. A couple minutes later brings the check, say \"I'm just going to leave this here\" and places it on the table. Didn't ask if we wanted anything else or dessert- and I'm midway through my meal . Didn't check on us at the end of the meal, to see if we needed boxes for our leftovers. Server is (again) nowhere to be found. Someone needs to re-train this server...",

I have ordered this from other Cracker Barrel locations and have always been thrilled with it. Not here. Contents of sandwich are spilling out of the sandwich, the cheese is over cooked and the grilled cheese was pulled off of the grill and served still attached to the sandwich. So okay, the cooks are busy or having a bad day.   Fine, but when I finally head to the cashier, she is so obsessed with high pressure up sales, that an already very long wait for food took way way longer. She just would not stop having ideas about things I surely must need. I needed none of them...I needed my lunch!!!!  By the time I got my lunch to the car, the sandwich was mushy and the fries were cold.    Very disappointed in this new location.",

We ordered our food quickly, as having been to several Cracker Barrel's all over the U.S. we knew exactly what we wanted. 35 minutes later our food arrived to the table. My husbands Brisket Breakfast had several pieces of a very tough clear string. When he pointed it out to the server, the server wanted to argue that it was egg. It clearly was NOT. My husband was showing him the string as the server continued to argue. Finally the server stating, \"So ya wanna another then?\" I kept the string to show the Manager, even after another server came over and tried to take it off of the table. When we flagged the Manager over he acted as though it was no big deal with a half apology, although stating he would take that meal off the bill. When the bill came it was for the full bill and I asked if this was the right bill? I was told, \"Yep, Uh Hugh!\" So we went to stand in line frustrated and kind of in shock that this was happening in a Cracker Barrel! When called over to pay, the checker SHOVED an open candle in my face almost hitting me with it. Wanting me to smell and buy a candle. I am NOT exaggerating this. As my husband wanted the manger again, I just wanted to get out! Horrible, HORRIBLE service!!!",

Spent 30 mins in store looking around their cool things then went outside sat in rocking chair in the shade, nice misting fans there to cool us off.  70 mins of waiting we were seated, 10 mins early. Hosts were friendly, all of the staff are new, raising stars.  A few experienced staff floating around.  Served right away by new girl, seemed overwhelmed as place was packed.  She was pleasant enough, took order and left.  Coffee was coming around every few mins. Meal arrived and was yummy as usual, no complaints. I love the southern hospitality of Cracker Barrel, don't know if Vegas can deliver that True southern hospitality yet, time will tell.",

My Mom and I got here super early because we knew that coming here within the first 2 days of opening would be bananas but it was perfect! From getting greeted upon entry and the incredible and prompt friendly service carried throughout from the dining area to the country store, wow they certainly know how to open a brand new business in Las Vegas! This staff will get to know me, my Mom and friends quite well because I'm a lifer! I can't say enough from the pancakes being my absolute favorite thing here, and the best I've EVER had, to the great atmosphere! Cheers to many more amazing times at CB, good things I live reeeeeally close!",

It was packed but I had gone on website before we walked in and put name down. I had such high hopes but I thought the food was garbage. The kids just got 2 pancakes and what kid doesn't like pancakes!! None of them finished them cause they said they were gross. My daughter said they were so greasy and the tiny thing of syrup they give was so watery. Then I ordered grammas something rather. It was eggs, bacon, grits and I chose biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were rock hard!! Gross!! I knew I wasn't gonna dig the grits but it was expected. And when the brought out the food it wasn't our waitress. It was someone else. And she brought out the wrong food and her and another waitress were arguing on where it goes. I told her we have 3 sets of 2 pancakes and then told her what I ordered. She said here is 2 orders of pancakes and I'll find your other food. So we sat, and sat. And the 2 sets of pancakes that she brought out had no syrup so the kids just sat there waiting while they got cold!! Finally I saw my waitress and asked for syrup and she said yes and asked where the rest of food was since 2 of us had nothing. I told her what happened and that they brought out wrong food or something. She apologized and came back with my food. Great but one kid still didn't have her pancakes and still the first 2 still didn't have their syrup. They had to eat cold pancakes!! Not impressed at all!!!",

The store inside was bright and filled with Knick knacks, candy, and clothing. I decided to eat first and check out the shop afterwards.  Service was overly nice and the restaurant was decorated beautifully. With the Christmas decorations up, it felt like it would start snowing any moment, even in the 70+ degree November weather. Very large menu that was hard to choose from! I settled with chicken + dumplings w/ two sides and my bf got their special of the day, which was pork chops. I'm giving three stars because the food was mediocre. It seemed to me like cafeteria food. Bland sides that could use more seasoning. Dry chicken and pork chops.  I guess my expectations were raised after seeing how nice the place was. If only the food was as beautifully executed as the building, I would think of returning.",

My favorite things about Cracker Barrel are the pancakes and hash brown casserole. The pancakes have some corn meal in them and have a crunch on the edges. Paired with their own hot syrup, so yum! I sneak a few tiny bottles home...why not?!   I've had lunch once and order their daily special (which varies day to day) and it was pretty good! Portion size was more than I expected and the chicken was tender.   I love the store! I could spend a lot of time looking around. There are some unique candies, chocolates, beverages, and jams/jellies you would not find in a regular store. They sell holiday items and decor, kids toys, and a bunch of other pretty cool things.

I had an amazing time and food was super delicious... anyways, here in vegas...All i can say is that it tasted nowhere close to what Ive tasted in SC! I ordered the porkchop and boy that pork was super dry!! Mom ordered the tue special trout with fries and her only complain was the fries as super hard.... good points: their kale salad with pecan was really good and their grilled chicken is good per my sister. i would have given a 2 star if our server was a lil attentive. He was overwhelmed I think for serving 3 tables cuz he kept missing our food. He forgot my salad, fried okra of my sister and have us creamer for I dunno what since nobody ordered coffee but those people next to us...lol. He was nice though dont get me wrong he just needs to slow down so he can deliver everything correctly. would I recommend it to my friends... i have to think about it many times there are more better southern food place here in vegas....",

I asked for toast with no holes so he says ok. I wait and wait remind u my eggs are getting colder and colder. He finally brings the toast. What a surprise NO  BUTTER, really! So he goes gets me butter  I eat my food drink coffee.   Chris ham with his breakfast was the wrong ham.  Ugh so he brings the right Ham. But ends up being too salty . At the end the manager comes over asks how the food was and we or I  explained it all she says oh I'm sorry I'll be right back.  She doesn't come back but the waiter does with the bill and mine is off the bill.  Now will I eat there again probably. I always give places 3 tries. Plus I love the gift shop with the goat lotions.

I have bin to many locations, in many different states. They have changed some things.   I had sandwiches. I ordered the  biscuits  with fried chicken inside. Oh soo good. Also ordered hash browns.  It was morning. Wow. I was told they make their own Colbey cheese. Which they put in the Mac n Cheese. My daughter almost cried, so good. And she is a 3rd year, straight A college student.  She knows about a good thing. Also Crack Colbey Cheese they say is in their Hash browns. Wow to amazing. My whole party loved this place. I loved this place.",

    "text": "ALL sorts of emotions here.   If you KNEW the journey I have been through for Cracker Barrel, only THEN would you understand how excited I am that they have a location in Las Vegas. Yeah sure, it's about 4 hours away from home, but it's closer than Chicago -- which is how far I flew out the last time I wanted their deliciously fluffy pancakes.  So if this isn't the only review you've read on Yelp, then you know that there is probably going to be a wait. And if you are one of those lucky people who didn't have to wait at all, then you're in the right city - the city of Lady Luck!  I am assuming, like many other things in this town, you are taking a gamble when you choose to dine here.  We went on a Saturday morning and we waited an hour for breakfast.  Our breakfast ended up being our lunch, but thank goodness they serve breakfast all day!  To be honest, it's just breakfast food. So why wait an hour? Because it's nostalgically delicious breakfast food.   Here are some things that you must order: pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cheese hash browns, and their corn bread.  You can get their eggs, or grits, or sausages... those are common place... ohhh but something about their pancakes, makes an hour long wait almost worth it.  That's about it, really.  I can see why people are so angry after waiting a few hours for food.   I get it.  But for me, nothing says \"I love you\" like syrup and melted butter over a nice stack of hot cakes.  Am I coming back? Oh yeah...",

This prompted a call from us, to which they replied that the food was being prepared and would be coming soon. After another half hour we finally received our food. The uber driver stated that this was the norm for this particular location. Now, my husband is currently waiting for a takeout order and is convinced that they are waiting for the chicken to lay the egg, hatch and grow so they can cook it before giving us our food! Takeout that is ordered ahead of time should NEVER take this long! As much as I enjoy the food, this will most likely be the last time we partake from this location.",

The waitress was so aloof that I questioned whether or not she was on drugs or a zombie ate her brain. She forgot half of my order and was nowhere to be found for almost 15 minutes. When she walked by, she never asked how we were doing. So I had to stop her and remind her...not once...but twice that she forgot all of my sides. Then after we were finished eating, we sat around for probably 15 min waiting for our check. The manager was like, \"How was everything?\" Uhhhhh. Dude. We have a whole table full of dirty dishes, does it appear that anyone even serviced our table? No drink refills and had to ask for biscuits three times. Then the best part was....the waitress asked if we needed boxes....ummm. All of the plates were stacked up on the side full of napkins and paper from the straws. What are we boxing up exactly? It was amazing. I love the store, but I will never eat there again until there is new management.",

We were seated immediately and quickly asked for drinks.  Then we ordered dinner a few minutes later.  Our service was great.  They had many servers working and staying on top of the customers.  I've read previous reviews and saw negative comments about wait time, restrooms and service.  Those were probably just grand opening glitches that needed fixing.  Probably common with many busy restaurants.   There was hardly any wait, the food was great, service was great and the restrooms were fine.  Wife had porkchop w/okra.  Son had biscuits and gravy w/bacon and I had the hamburger steak w/veggies.  We were all happy with our meals and left full and it's not expensive at all.  Under $30 total for 3 people and iced teas.  If you like home cooked meals with great service and a cool gift shop up front.  Come check this place out.  There's a lot of places to choose from in Vegas.  Not like this though....",

    "text": "I have been curious to try this place because I remember it from Growing up in Texas. We came here early on a Sunday (no wait) and were immediately seated. We sat for about 4-5 minutes when finally we were greeted. Not only did the waitress (Jennifer g) push for drink order, but also food order. It felt so rushed. My husband stumbled through the menu and ordered without really knowing what he wanted. We waited about ten minutes and the food came out very fast. We didn't see the server that entire time. When the food was dropped, Jennifer came back and gave us our check! She didn't check on how the food was, she didn't ask if we needed refills, just the check. We felt so pushed out, it was ridiculous. The food itself is ok. The portions are ridiculously large, but it really wasn't that great. The breakfast eat all tastes previously frozen. The one saving grace is the hash brown casserole, which is the only reason this review is two stars than one star.  After eating, we did a quick scan of the table, made sure the kids had everything, and left.  We paid with the cashier and walked to the car. At that point it had been maybe three minutes. We realized my son had forgotten his favorite hotwheels car and my husband went inside to retrieve it.  There was already a new couple at the table and he asked the hostess if the busboy had found it.  Nope, they had thrown it away.  I get it, my son shouldn't have left it, but the carelessness and lack of empathy from the staff was appalling.  The whole experience felt very \"get them in and get them out.\"  I personally will not go again.  I would urge others to think twice before going.",

I love the shop when you first walk in. Super cute! Glitter and shiney stuff everywhere so I was excited to shop after breakfast. My guy and I were seated and told our server would be right with us to take our drink order. We sat there so long that I purposely made eye contact with every server that came our way. Nothing! Completely ignored by the staff yet a couple that came in way after us were sat across from us and taken care of right away. After lots more time passed I finally stopped a server that had made eye contact with me several times mind you and asked him if he could please find our server because no one had acknowledged us for so long. The server (in a surprised tone) says he'll take our order if we are ready. Ummmm...I asked for service, which meant I'm ready and have been for a long time. The food wasn't as great as I expected. The coffee was so weak that two creamers turned it super white. The silver ware was covered in soap and water stains. Needless to say, I will not be going back and did not spend a penny in the shop before I left. I'm sticking to Dean's down the street, they have never disappointed me.",

So now that we had waited the hour plus an extra 20 minutes they called our name then told us we had to wait for our table to be exited by previous guests.

How could 4 people sit at a table with 2 chairs ?! Then I asked the hostess if we could sit at the table with 4 chairs that was cleaned and she said that was assigned to another guest!!!!

But there was a gigantic line that snaked thru the restaurant - and that was for the cash register!  Food was better than average, prices were better than average. Service was slightly on the slow side, but was expecting worse when I walked in. Corporate needs to look at management here. It's obvious to an amateur that they need more servers, cooks, and cashiers on duty, so obviously they're just trying to save a buck at the expense of customer's time. Overpriced junk in store. Great coffee. Waitress named Sasha was very nice and was busting her ass, but everyone else was slow. Give that kid a raise and get her some help. I'll try again for bfast, but probably the location on Craig.",

I asked about the wait time. She was having a conversation with someone else and the phone disconnected (hung up) with no answer to my question. I immediately called back and Jeanette answered again. I explained to her that I was hung up on and again began to ask about wait times. Before I could get the question out she snapped back that she did not hang up on me. Wow, I surly did not want to argue about it. Just wanted some chicken fried steak and eggs. Her attitude was terrible so I asked to speak to a manager. She sarcastically said \"Sure hold one moment please.\" After two minutes the phone was picked up and hung up. I called back twice after and the line was busy... Finally the third time a female who seemed to be disguising her voice answered. I asked for a manager and was put on hold for four minutes at which point I said screw it. I'll spend my money elsewhere... This is Las Vegas the home of hospitality. Cracker Barrel you failed...",

I'm so excited to finally have access to country ham, cheesy hashbrowns, and fried apples, all the time.

Got seated and waited another 30 minutes for the food. The server kept apologizing. I didn't mind all the waiting until I tasted my food and couldn't understand what the hype was about. Biscuits were soft but the gravy was flavorless. French toast had absolutely no flavor as well and the famous syrup was just like water. Famous jam was horrible. Hash browns were meh. Bacon was under cooked. Grits were horrible. My husband did like his country fried chicken. All I can think is people come here strictly for the price but egg and I has the same prices and is 100 times better. I gave 2 stars for the service which was spot on. We both left felling disappointed and like we wasted 2 hours of our day. Also, my stomach hurt the rest of the day. I would never come back.",

As a retired Cracker Barrel employee I was appalled at the horrid food, the poor service, the long wait to be seated when no one was in front of me, and the so ridiculously over crowded merchandise in the store! Disgusting !! Cold food, dropped on the table by a disinterested wait staff. Never should meatloaf dinner or eggs, or chicken and dumplings be served cold. Asked for water, ice, lemon. Got 1/2 glass water no lemon no ice. Made me wonder if it was just grabbed out of the dirty dishes and delivered to me. The store is so badly stuffed with merchandise that I gave up trying to find what i wanted after s few minutes. What the heck has happened to Cracker Barrel!! Don't eat there!! MacDonalds has hot( temperature) food at 1/2 the price and faster service.  Management is rude and totally disrespectful and disinterested!  Give up serving food Cracker Barrel, stick to some decent interesting \" old country store\" merchandise with the jams, candy, quilts, items, otherwise please close your store and return to a southern location with home cooked food, and respectful employees.

    "text": "We tend to dine at Cracker Barrel's all over the U.S. as we travel since there aren't any quite yet in California. We are pretty familiar with their food, menus and practices. This particular Cracker Barrel is uniquely out of touch with reality and company practice. Usually, there is a wait for seating most everywhere, but here it seems to be way longer than usual, even when it isn't all that busy. Why?    Once seated, your server usually is quick to come to the table for drink orders and perhaps even food orders if you are ready. That was fairly True at this place, too, but then be prepared for an extra long wait for the now cold food to arrive. Managers start by using the \"that's just the way we do it\" defense - which doesn't work once you have been to several other Cracker Barrel locations. We waited some 45 minutes to get cold food that should have been hot. It appears that the biggest problem areas may be the kitchen and the management - why argue with customers when they are long time customers?  The same basic problems happened on our first visit here so we tried again. It was WORSE the second time. Finally a different manager tried to resolve the problem, but by then the die had pretty much been cast. We hope Corporate staff will intervene soon and fix this place so we can return pleasantly.",

    "text": "Been to Cracker Barrels from \"sea to shining sea\", this Las Vegas, NV , store is the closest ...to the Pacific Ocean...and it should be \"deep sixed.\"  The worst service, I have ever received at this confused, excuse laden, unexcusable mess, called a restaurant!, I was so excited that CB had come further west but alas!  Not a good location.    In Las  Vegas, there are 1000's of restaurants and buffets....why do you suck?????  The first waiter disappeared after she brought biscuits and touched them with her booboo, bandaid, hand.. another waiter and another waiter, topped off by snotty manager, D@#e, who villified everything I told him about our lackluster disaster of an experience.... (the 4 different wait staff asking me, \"what dressing do you want again?\")    ME:  FRENCH. WAIT STAFF:  RANCH?  My salad comes after my meal, no dressing on the side, 2 tablespoons of green beans, argumentative D@#e, the manager,  likes to tell customers\" what is\" and \"what is not\"...bossing customers around like bad, little children...so no napkins for you!!!  Then he accuses me of calling him an idiot....whaaaa????   Do not clean up the restaurant and tell us why we have no salt, pepper or napkins, because WE DON'T CARE!!!...YOU ARE OPEN UNTIL 10 p.m. SO GET ORGANIZED!!",

Customer service was horrible, and the food was honestly ehhhh.  I ordered eggs, bacon, sausage  and biscuits with gravy. The bacon was burnt, and the sausage was gross and beef jerky like. The only thing that was pretty good was the biscuits.  I have definitely had better breakfast in town.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. There might be better locations in the country, but this Las Vegas location sucks.  Spend your money else where, or make your food at home, it'll probably be a lot better.  Plus it's way to loud in the restaurant to even hear yourself think.   Oh and I asked my server for a side of butter, and he grabbed someone else's and gave me theirs! Like i don't know about you, but that was a little weird.",

However, the last time I went I got the pot roast.  Talk about comfort food! The downside, for whatever reason they didn't give us our cornbread and biscuits, which was included in our order.  The service is usually top notch.  With how often we frequent this place there has only been one server that wasn't quite up to par.  He was slow to take our order, seemed to rush through when he finally was taking our order, and didn't refill our drinks unless we asked. (And this is the same guy that didn't give us our biscuits.). But the other 20+ times we've been here, no complaints.  The best part?  A place to shop while you wait?  Genius!",

Uly was our one awesome listener since he brought the sauce without forgetting.   our ice teas were never once refilled during our meal and the server Dani was not around for us to even ask, till we saw her towards the end when she dropped off our check. we asked for a box and bag... and she brought the box without the bag. overall, the service was terrible with the exception of Joseph who offered to take care of our drinks and a lady named Britney who was super nice to check on our eggs.   we were on the way out when we the cashier asked about our experience and empathized with the lackluster service. he brought over Chase the manager. super friendly guy. appreciated the service of him taking the time to apologize for the experience and asked us to come back next time to make things better. i don't think ill be back anytime soon, but because of how things ended, i would give this another chance in the future. thank you joseph, britney, uly, & chase for excellent guest follow up service!",

Last time we ate at CB was about 5 years ago, we traveled by road from California to Florida and back with virtually all our meals eaten at Cracker Barrel's along the way.  LOVED THIS PLACE.   We were excited to see a new location open on the way into Vegas.  With BIG anticipation we rolled in on Sunday morning for chicken fried steak and their (used to be) amazing hash brown casserole.   When looking for directions in Yelp we noticed only 3 stars which should have been a warning.    The portions are notably smaller and the much beloved chicken fried steak was merely okay but the biggest disappointment was the hash brown casserole which was so heavily laden in garlic powder the you could not taste anything else.   Was so excited to go but came to the sad realization that this was my last trip to which was truly an eating institution....  I might have given 2 or 3 stars if I didn't know how good it used to be",

Either way, this cured me of ever wanting to eat here again.  The food reminded me of store-brand frozen dinners, like Banquet. Only that unnecessarily insults Banquet. The dumplings were anything but home-made, the chicken clearly not the real thing (tasted like the bags of frozen chicken cutlets you can buy at Target and Walmart where the labels advise that they've been injected with an 80% saline water solution, or something along those lines).  Fried okra had been fried long before. They were out of both honey for the biscuits and sweet potatoes. The cinnamon apples (identified as fried apples on the menu) were worse than mush.  And yes, the wait was long. The tables are crowded so close together you feel like you're at summer camp or in a high school cafeteria. Noise level is very unpleasant to the point of being stressful.  I won't be back. Especially since I literally just threw up while writing this review.

I realize this is a new restaurant, but they taste the same throughout  the country. People should support local restaurants, not chains. If you have never tried the Sunrise Cafe, go there. Food is much better.",

When you come from a place that doesn't have Cracker Barrel, the closest one is always packed. Karen knew the menu and knew exactly what to suggest. My husband enjoyed his catfish and I enjoyed my ham, eggs and apples. The serving size is plentiful. If you want a nice, warm delicious country meal, this is the place to go!!",

Let's just say it was the longest minute as we never received refill. Also asked for hot sauce, again waiter said I'll bring it right back. All he brought back was the bill. I guess since it is open for a few weeks the staff rather get you in and out instead of making sure you'd want to come back. Not worth the wait or drive there.",

Got on the waitlist while shopping at bass pro and checking on the mermaids at Silverton. The estimated wait time was correct. It was a Sunday, and I saw the picture if the advertised Sunday fried chicken.  I ordered the chicken with kale salad and mac n cheese for my sides. Did combo of corn muffin and biscuit. Everything was delish. Huge portion.  Brought half home for dinner. Our server was great. She was friendly and attentive. Only glitch was when we asked someone for a bag for our containers and they said to ask up front.  Asked the hostess who said as a cashier. Ask the cashier who said ask the server. Went back to the table and asked the manager who was walking by, who said ask the cashier. I said I asked everybody and they keep sending me to someone else. So he personally brought us bags. A little miscommunication amongst the staff I think. Just bring a bag when you bring the to go container. Our waitress was great, even though we were her last table, she didn't rush us and offered us to go cups for our ice tea. Much better experience than my visit prior. The Sunday chicken is the bomb!",

Well we finally get in and sat for 20 minutes before anyone said hi.  We didn't even know who our server was.   Someone who worked the other side of the place was bringing someone food and she stopped to see what was going on.    They bring out the meals and they looked like kid meals.   For us girls it was ok since we were having banana pudding but not for a guy.   My husband sent it back and didn't even eat.    The food was cold because it probably sat there for awhile.    Then they bring one banana pudding out.   Doesn't even look like the picture.    So then after a very long time they bring two out and don't even put the Carmel on top.    He said he wasn't charging for the desert.    And I told the manager I don't see why I would pay for any of it.    He took care of it.     But the food made me sick.   Won't be back",

    "text": "Travel in the mid west and east coast and love Cracker Barrel but on vacation in Vegas and had a terrible time here.  There was no wait for a table Sunday 6/16/19 evening so that is a sign the business is in trouble at this location.  The waiter had a great attitude and has a great memory can remember what drinks you order.  But when he brought the food out each person in the party was missing a side order.  No apples with the breakfast and gravey butter but no biscuts.  What does cracker want us to do with gravey and butter?   Also missing hash brown.  The manager I think her name was Elle came to the table but was hostile with me because I could not remember the exact name of what I ordered I ordered the big boy breakfast and was calling it the poor boy breakfast. Here is the IQ level of management at this place how many breakfasts has boy in the name.  She could not figure it out just by looking at the plate?  Does she really work for you guys or a temp manager?   My daughter saw here chew out some other customers very loudly about 20 yards away.   Funny how this manager takes things out on the customer.  Is Cracker barrel management morons?  Why is it my fault her staff forgot side orders?   the waiter came out and was in shock and said they did not bring that out?   he was the one bringing out the food.   I travel for business and saw Cracker on the side of the road with full parking lots and stopped in and fell in love with the food and service but when I tell my family and take them on vacation to Las Vegas or Orlando the service is terrible.  I was in Boise for two weeks and eat there every morning and to prove this there is a gentleman who is there every morning and sits in the same seat.  We were the only two in the place early in the morning.  I had great service breakfast and dinner for two weeks not one mistake.  I got to this Las Vegas location and the services is S.   If you have a problem with process fire management there.  If it is personnel then pay more in Vegas but your quality is killing your reputation since the majority are people on vacation and may be eating there for the first time.   Also note for low IQ executives I walked in and was seated right away and had to get my family that started shopping in the store.  There was no over flow of business that could have caused this lousy service.   Fix it.",

    "text": "Upon arrival to this location, we could tell that the staff seemed disorganized.  We waited in a line to check in, and everyone was being seated as they approached the counter.  The restaurant had plenty of staff and it was not full, maybe half of the tables had paying diners at them. When we were seated, the server Dina, came over to take our drink order.  We ordered our drinks and a dessert item.  When the dessert item was ordered, she seemed confused and quite irritated asking if we were going to be dining or just getting the dessert.  When we let her know we were going to order food she let us know she would grab our drinks.  When she brought back our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order, and I informed her we would need a minute, since we just got there.  Not even two minutes later she came back asking us if we were ready to order, she seemed very rushed, so we ordered our food, my sister ordered a salad, and I ordered the chicken BLT, and our friend ordered the Country fried steak.  When I ordered my food I told her I did not want the coleslaw, and told her I wanted NO BACON on the sandwich.  Then I asked if they had turkey bacon instead, and when she told me no, I told her \"okay, no bacon then.\"  We also ordered a side of biscuits.  When the food finally arrived, it was not our waitress and we only had the country fried steak and the chicken BLT.  When seeing the chicken BLT I informed the waitress that this would need to go back because it was not supposed to have bacon on it.  She then took it back, and not five minutes later Dina comes back with the same sandwich with the bacon removed, and an extra slice of cheese thrown on the top.  If the problem was just a bacon removal, I could have done that myself, but the fact that they decided to just take the bacon off and give it back is an entirely different issue.  I then told Dina that I would not eat it, and she immediately got an attitude and told us she would get her manager.  We then waited while the rest of my party ate their food, no manager ever came to the table for that issue, and after that point we never were served again until my sister called over the manager to ask about the biscuits we ordered that never came.  She informed us that they were making a new batch and that she would bring us some as soon as they were done, this was at the end of our meal our waitress never informed us of this.  We were not helped again or asked how our meal was until Dina came to the table to give us our check.  I cannot believe how terrible this experience was, and I do not think I have ever received this terrible of service EVER.  The fact that Dina never got her manager for my table, and I sat there with no meal, not by my choice, but because I was never offered another meal was just insane.  What was even more insane was that I was never offered an apology for the mistake.  I came here to enjoy a dinner with family and a friend and I sat there for an hour and a half with no food, and no service.",

My eggs were wrong so I had to send my food back which made me madder because I had already waited ALMOST 2 HOURS!  The cornbread that was brought to the table was ROCK HARD.  I cant believe they would send that out for someone to eat!  When a manager finally came over he was in training, didnt offer to comp ANYTHING or give a token for the inconvenience. I felt like he was sent over to pacify me.  I ended up speaking to the manager Christine of the restaurant who was apologetic and did compensate for the issues but I know for a FACT I won't be back on a weekend.  No pictures because the table has since been cleared. I started off giving one star but bumped it up to 3 because of Christine.  BTW the food was flavourful.",

    "text": "I can describe Cracker Barrel in one word: CROWDED!!!  My family and I went here twice and ate here once. The first time we came we were told that the wait is an hour and 10 minutes. No way. So we got smart for the next day and went to the website where you can add your name to the waiting list. Once we arrived, it was a 15 minute minute wait.   During those 15 minutes I spent my time in the \"country store\" looking at useless stuff for sale. I remember that other Cracker Barrel's in the south sold cute things and yummy treats. This location has very few treats and a lot of junk. Even so, it was wall to wall people and very hard to get around the store.   We were seated against the wall and even with the shade drawn down I had sun beating against the side of my face and the other lady had sun directly in her face. Nothing could be done about it except squint. When the meal was almost over, the sun did move so it wasn't so bright.  I ordered pancakes and eggs, two ordered meatloaf, and one ordered chicken fried steak. My pancakes were really good and cooked just right. Fluffy on the inside and a crunch on the outside. Grits were served but they weren't that good because they were runny. Biscuits and cornbread came but neither were very tasty. Easily skipped.   The service was wonderful. Overall, I would come back here again but I'd never come without putting my name on the wait list first. It's not the best food but it's nostalgic and I guess that counts for something,",

After our long wait, we were called on the overhead and got seated right away. They have a fun little game on the table to play to kill more time while you wait for your food.

My cousin finished his food with the quickness before mine even came out. I was excited fo dat hashbrown casserole but it had some hard parts and just seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile. They food was so bland and didn't have much taste. Also their cornbread is not the sweet type because I thought it was going to be.

    "text": "***Cracker Barrel, a popular country kitchen restaurant chain in the Midwest and the South, now has a location just off The Strip; the food varies from okay to satisfying, but the portions are incredibly generous***  Las Vegas has brought in many big brands and chains recently.  There is a White Castle now.  A Shake Shack.  Now, there is a Cracker Barrel, which is located just off The Strip next to the Silverton casino and hotel.  Cracker Barrel is a chain business that features a restaurant and a faux general store selling dry goods provisions and seasonal items.  The general store offers several items that are probably a waste of money (or at the very least, just items you probably do not need).  The general store though makes the potential long waits you may experience at Cracker Barrel more tolerable.  It also does feature a few fun things like a variety of packaged snacks and sweets, which includes some hard to find and nostalgic candy options.  Cracker Barrel always features seasonal decorations.  The restaurant at Cracker Barrel offers great value.  You can get breakfast all day.  Lunch and dinner are also served.  Most of their lunch and dinner options are in the $9 to $14 range and feature very generous portions.  I had the chicken n' dumplins platter.  The portion of chicken n' dumplins was very generous--lots of chicken breast meat and a fair amount of dumplins.  The chicken breast was fairly good for chain restaurant chicken (it was not too dry).  The dumplins were good.  They had a good chicken noodle quality even if the dumplins themselves were a little doughy.  Unfortunately, the chicken n' dumplins as well as the standard offering of mashed potatoes and gravy were both lukewarm in temperature.  The platter came with 2 additional sides.  I had the turnip greens with ham hock.  The ham hock was a tad salty while the greens were quite bitter (even more bitter than I was expecting).  The fried okra was decent.  There was definitely quite a bit of fried batter so you kind of lose the okra flavor.  The platter was finished with 2 mini cornbread muffins.  They were quite crisp on the outside.  I wish they were a tad sweeter.  Service was very friendly and quick.  Prices are good as they are not too expensive and you get very generous portions.  In terms of decor, Cracker Barrel has a faux old timey look.  Cracker Barrel is not a bad option for large families looking for a lunch or dinner before they get to The Strip or after leaving The Strip.  Cracker Barrel offers free self parking.  The lot is big and it is easy finding and open space.",

Although not my hubbies first time, and i was excited to try it out for His birthday we waited 1 hour, which was not bad bcuz according to the hostess the longest was 3 hours.  Once we were seated we were attended quickly.  Our drinks were served almost immediately.   The waitress brought out a chipped glass cup which a shard of glass fell into the water, thank God we noticed that quickly.  I ordered the French dip sandwich with a side of dumplings, the dumplings were barely warm, the sandwich however was amazing, but i wasn't brought my au jus 15 minutes after the manager had noticed that we we're trying to eye down our waitress who was busy, the manager took care of our issues , the chipped cup, the soda refill and the au jus for my sandwich, and his biscuits (which may or may not be frozen)   My husband had the \"grandpa fried steak\" he had a side of biscuits and gravy.. grits and loaded hash brown casserole, the cheese on his hash browns were \"warm and ugly\"  The fried steak very flavorful though, the grits were \"alright\" and the gravy was also on the verge of being cold, and the biscuits were brought out later along with the au jus and the drinks; and by then the gravy was cold and not much intriguing to eat with hot biscuits & cold gravy.. also the fact that our waitress told us that our \"blue berry muffins were frozen\" so they would take longer to be ready, but she had us confused with the couple next to us who did order the muffins ... the fact that they are frozen was a turn off, because you'd think being a \"southern \" home feel restaurant you'd make Your breads /muffins fresh. Would we return?  Possibly but not to the Las Vegas One, On top of waiting for such a Long time to be seated and wait for food that isn't to the standards that you'd assume a highly recommended sought out restaurant would have, but missed it... we'd probably would go to another location in our home state.",

But the time waiting for our table flew by because we were able to spend our time inside the lovely shop they have. The little store was filled from the ceiling to the floors of mostly fun little nic-nacs, family games and more.   Breakfast was good, and filling. Large portions and the price was relatively normal $10-12/person. I had the grilled chicken BLT and my mom enjoyed a large breakfast with pancakes and all. Honestly out of both of our meals- the pancakes were the most memorable. Food was nice, restaurant is clean, and the service was great.   I will visit again in the future, but it is not on the top of my list for brunch joints.",

When this place first opened the food was on point, service was impeccable (southern hospitality at its best), and the people who worked there seemed to love their job.    Fast forward tonight...THUMBS down .  The only 1 Star is for the host/hostess who sat us.  Our server wasn't pleasant at all.  She seemed unhappy to be serving us?!!  She served us before and was a lot nicer and eager to be there.  Maybe something has changed within CB employee affairs?  Whatever it is, she was wasn't happy.    ***Side note:  while we were waiting for our order, my son asked me for crayons because he saw another customer's child coloring - I asked one of the employees who was standing by the fireplace (doing nothing but observing everyone) if she could bring my son some crayons and she immediately said \"sure\".  A few moments later she comes back empty-handed like she totally blew off what I just asked her like we didn't just speak.  Mind you, she wasn't doing ANYTHING but standing by the fireplace.  I finally got up and just walked over to the hostess and asked for some crayons myself in which she happily gave to me.  I walked by the employee standing by the fireplace with the crayons and she looked at me like she had no idea??!!  {Get it together CRACKER B!}  Customer service went out the window!!!  What the heck happened to this place?!!  For a chain restaurant this location is NOT keeping up w/CB standards!!!    We won't be coming back here again - I agree w/the other Yelper: Jennifer S!!!",

I ordered the Catfish with Mac and cheese and fried Okra. Fried Okra was pretty good, but the Mac & Cheese and Catfish was sooooooo bland. Like, no flavor at all. I got a side of Gravy to go with their \"World famous biscuits\". The gravy was also bland. Biscuits were OK, not certain how they are world famous.  My Wife had the all american cheeseburger, which she said was the most bland, non flavored burger she has ever had in her 30 years of life.  Of course our kids enjoyed it because they're kids and don't know any better and my mom said her Chicken Gizzards were good but not justifiable for the whole meal. My wife's first experience at a Cracker Barrel was in Dallas and she said it was the best restaurant she's ever ate at. I'll probably give Cracker Barrel another chance.........in a different state.",

Went to the manager and ask for the check explained the horrible experience.. She didn't seem to care considering everyone else was complaining too. Took our check and moved along to pay.. Cashier line was horribly long cause everyone was complaining about the service sad. At cashier another  female manager stood carelessly listening to all the complaints really had nothing to say.

I said yes I would like to place an order to go. She replied,Do you know what you want? I said yes, so she calls on the radio that there's someone up front who wants to place a to go order. Than looks at me and says she will be right with you. I wait and after about 5 minutes she tells me that Taylor is swamped and she will be right with me. So I walk around the store mind you I'm the only one trying to place an order. So I ask the girl standing at the podium for a menu while I wait. Again I wait a good 10 more minutes. Finally I just drop the other stuff I was gonna buy with our dinner and walk out. I don't get making someone stand there for a certain person to take your order? There were 3 other people in the front that could have helped me or acknowledged I was waiting. The one guy Jordan had to tell the blond girl standing there on her phone, texting I presume to answer the phone cause it was ringing. Awful that this place is run like this.  The ones back east aren't like this place at all  Gonna be done with them for awhile anyway. Food at this one is mediocre anyway.",

The manager seemed unbothered by this poor cooking, not even apologizing at all. Along with the eggs, I had to send the ham back because it also was lukewarm and soooo dry. The only good thing and hot thing they served us was the hashbrown casserole. I used to like Cracker Barrell, but I probably will not visit this one ever again.",

Service was slow, but when the wait staff did arrive, they were forgetful at best, obviously overwhelmed and understaffed.  Examples:  couldn't get silverware, even after food arrived.  The order was missing side dishes and had to make several requests for items they forgot to bring.  The food was just average, nothing worth a repeat visit. The final inconvenience and indicator of poor management was the long line of people waiting to pay their bill at the single cashier on duty.  Restaurant patrons had to contend with gift shop souvenir purchasers in the same check out line.  Ridiculous.   Never again!",

    "text": "I'd heard so many great things about Cracker Barrel that I couldn't wait to try it. I was staying at the Silverton with the kiddo and really the breakfast options aren't great there. I saw Cracker Barrel was in close walking distance so I thought it would be a great idea to head there for a nice breakfast.  You walk in to Cracker Barrel and into a nice country store full of gifts, candies and even Raiders memorabilia. Off to your left is the entrance to the restaurant. We were quickly seated and greeted. We received drinks and made our order. I went with the biscuits, gravy & bacon and the biscuit, hash brown casserole and fried apples plates. The kiddo got the three pancakes plate. The food came out really fast. Very nice. The biscuits and gravy though, were disappointing. Especially coming from a country style restaurant. You get three biscuits and a container of gravy to pour over them. The biscuits were somewhat crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. The big issue was the gravy. It was pretty bland and I had to add salt to it (!!!). The hash brown casserole was different but I liked it. The fried apples tasted like pie filling to me. But the skin was still on the apples so it definitely wasn't out of a can. The kiddo liked her pancakes. I had a couple of bites and they were decent. Not the fluffiest but the maple syrup they use was very good. Service was awesome. All the servers were very friendly and attentive.  Not sure if it was a case of the hype setting me up for disappointment but I wasn't terribly impressed with Cracker Barrel. The country store was cool and worth checking out, the service was great and the food came out fast. But that same food though. It's not something I'd come back for, especially in a city like Las Vegas where there are so many world class places to eat.",

A personal favorite from my mom herself is the Pork Chop Meal and she gives it 3.5 stars And my dad got the Sampler with Ham, Chicken, and Dumplins and he gives it 4.5 stars.    The atmosphere was very quiet nobody was they except for me and my family and a group of three people sitting next to us.   The service was great I like how the lady that served us gave me another side to choose from since all the apple slices were gone and that's why I choose the Hashbrown Casserole so I could get my ranch sauce to eat with my Fried Chicken Tenderloins.     I would like to come back here again, again, and again because they have such a nice waiter and a country store in front of it it's very convenient for people who want to get toys or treats really quickly anyway that is why I want to go back there.",

    "text": "My mother in law has been raving about CB forever and had to try it.  We came for breakfast on a Sunday morning.   Check in is at the front outside and it looks like a porch with rocking chairs that are for sale.  It was busy and wait was 30 mins but we got in about 20 mins.  You walk through the country store before the dining room so it was packed.  The dining room is cutely decorated.  Tables are neatly placed but very close to one another.  You can reach over and touch the person next to you.    Service is on point and we never had to wait very long for anything.  We got our food within 10-12 mins.  I ordered the country boy breakfast with steak that included a sample of everything.  Hubs ordered french toast.  Very tasty well seasoned steak although a bit tough but for $12 didn't expect high grade. BEST hash browns that have cheese mixed in. Good grits and apples.  French toast was also the best.  You can taste how much egg is inside.  You pay for your meal in the store and you can add your purchases to it.  The store is surprisingly very reasonably priced.  We spent about $50 in there.    We enjoyed it here so much that we came for lunch the next day.  Lunch was not as good.  The corn bread was so dry and hard it was not edible.  My chicken strips were on par with Denny's so it tasted like frozen.    I still give it 5 stars because there is so much I Love about CB.  I would not hesitate to go again.  They different than anything in its class (breakfast places) that I enjoy the nuances.",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel is about as 2 stars as it gets. They don't do anything bad, but they really don't do anything good either. They're kind of like the middle brother of restaurants. It's just...there.   So I've eaten at Cracker Barrel on two different occasions many, many years apart. I vaguely remembered the first time around that I thought they had really good syrup. Why syrup would stand out and not the meal? Not sure. Well, fast forward like 7-8 years, and I think they still have good syrup, and my entree was highly forgettable. For my entree I went with pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Kind of a staple breakfast for a place that caters to breakfast connisieurs. The pancakes were overcooked, and not just a little overcooked, like dark brown. The bacon was good, crispy just like I ordered it. The eggs, which I ordered over medium, were clearly cooked on way too hot of a griddle and closer to over easy. Pancakes had a decent flavor had they been cooked better.  My wife ordered the chicken fried steak dinner. Another blah-zay option. Gravy didn't have a ton of flavor. The meat did taste a little funny. Again, as a place that is comfort food city, you expect these meals to be decent, and they weren't.  The service also left something to be desired as well. We went on a Friday night, so we expected it to be busy. However, when the third waiter came over to help us, after placing our drink order two prior times it got a little frustrating. We also were dining with our 18 month old and always place his order with our drink order. We asked if we could get some of the biscuits they offer so that the little guy could get his eat on sooner than later. After 15 minutes, asking 4 separate people, we finally got the biscuits, followed by his meal about 30 seconds later. Our meals took another 15 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food a good 40 minutes had passed, we had an antsy toddler, and we were done. When the food comes out and it's less than desirable, it becomes Jason's Series of Unfortunate Events.  PS - the biscuits we eventually got were the most tasteless things I've ever tried in my entire life. Pillsbury canned biscuits are like 11x better.  Slow service, mediocre food at best, and wait times that make zero sense for what they offer. Likely going to pass in the future, which is too bad, because I want this place to be good.",

    "text": "What I had hoped would be a much anticipated visit to treat my Dad for the new fried chicken special at one of my comfort food favorites from past road trips turned into an extremely disappointing first and final visit. This location is what you've come to know and love-cute country store with comfort food-nothing different than any other even being in Vegas. As we were being escorted to our table I immediately started to feel concern (full disclosure I am a former 20 year F&B veteran) seeing tables full of food (particularly fried chicken) left on the plate-sitting on tables waiting to be bussed, and there were ALOT of tables uncleaned with garbage on the floor; food debris, dirty napkins etc.  it's 9pm and it is not busy at all-maybe 1/4 full...on a Friday. Hmmm. The host stops in between two dirty tables and offers us the table in the middle of-I quickly (and kindly) ask for the table near the window and he obliges. We sat for 10 minutes without any acknowledgement as multiple servers breezed by. I finally waived down a young man who came over with a \"who me? look as he approached the table and when he arrived was in the final process of scratch/picking his nose and then proceeded to run his hands through his hair telling me he wasn't our server but he'd get us some drinks.  Ummm I don't want you touching anything of mine! Well, he leaves and a few more minutes go by (8?) and I waive down another girl  who proceeded to take our order-I also inform her of my request to not have the young man be anywhere near our drinks or food for his lack of hygiene. Now I'll shorten the next- 1. Ordered their special berry tea-they were out of it 2. Ordered the Strawberry Lemonade with unlimited refill-I got one and they ran out of it 3. My order was wrong-gave me mashed potatoes when I ordered Mac and cheese. 4. My sirloin was to be  medium rare-it looked up at me and mooed. 5. My Dads fried chicken we came in for-raw and uncooked -he had one bite and that was it. Just like all the plates of food I saw as we walked in, should have known better.  AND who brought our food out??? Mr Nosepicker!!!!   Appetite killed.  We scooped down the Mac and cheese, split a corn on the cobb, some broccoli and a few corn muffins. So much for dinner. I took the sirloin home for my dogs and I'm thinking twice about that choice as I write this.  The unbussed tables remained dirty the entire time we were there.  I counted them-10.  Now for the management-I saw the manager several times come out from the kitchen and peruse the dining room seeming pleased that all was going well.  But it wasn't and the fact you weren't concerned that your dining room was a dirty, disheveled mess and didn't once attempt to clean a table yourself tells me you are in desperate need of training as the example you are setting is not one I would wish for my restaurant. Where you not concerned when you saw full plates being left, food not being eaten? Did you look at it to easily see it wasn't properly being prepared? Are you watching what is coming out of the kitchen?Dirty tables and floors?  Your staff was lackluster, unfocused and seemed confused as to who was doing what and for what table.  The young lady who waited on us was new, and did her best to resolve what she could-I wished her luck in her job, gave her a $10 tip and restrained myself from saying RUN! For a new job!  I did buy 2 candles in sale and some nice bookends-so not a total loss of night.  I'm local-and there are a lot of F&B people here-and they will see what I see...quickly, maybe that's why it wasn't busy.  You will not get a local crowd if you continue to run a restaurant like this as there are many options for great food-breakfast, lunch or dinner. Maybe that's the plan-live off the tourists for a one and done-if so-that too won't last as they have a lot of choice too...and YELP.",

We've only eaten at this Cracker Barrel one other time (about a week after it opened) and it was NOT a good experience. Well, this time was NOT any better. The service was horrible. I will say my fried chicken was good but my husbands had a lot of raw dough. The sides were terrible; the fries were cold, the okra was mushy, the hash brown casserole tasted like it came from the frozen food section of the grocery store & they heated it in the microwave and the coleslaw was so-so.  We received our biscuits about halfway through our meal, I had to ask for the apple butter (which took an additional ask to receive). We weren't even halfway through our lunch when our server asked if we were ready for dessert. What? So, once we finished picking over what we wanted to eat (and mostly what we didn't want to eat), we decided to order bread-pudding (My husbands favorite). Well, this too was a disappointment.  It came with no caramel sauce as shown on the picture and was flavorless. I can honestly say I just don't understand why people rave about and go crazy for Cracker Barrel??? It's terrible, we will NEVR eat at another Cracker Barrel again.",

    "text": "I've been in Las Vegas since 2007.  People ask me, do you miss Kentucky?  The answer is, \"I miss Cracker Barrel.\"  I will admit to crying tears of joy upon learning we were getting this fine establishment.  When I am in need of some hearty, delicious Southern breakfast, Uncle Hershel always delivers. Always.  This Crack Bar is consistent. I've gone on a weekday, a weekend and even PostMated it. I am not ashamed.  The wait times are minimal, but if you find yourself waiting before the heat kicks in, mosey out to the porch and find a rocking chair. No matter what ails you, a rocking chair is the cure.  Once your name gets called and you find yourself in the cavernous dining room (all Crack Bars are loud), be prepared for fast, friendly service. My biggest complaint about CB is that service is hit or miss. Not so here. We have always had great service and a visit from the manager to check on us. A+  Now for the food. My ability to make recommendations is severely compromised by the fact that I literally order Uncle Hershel's Favorite every single time. I can tell you the biscuits are crunchy, the gravy is the perfect consistency (no glue here!) and the food is hot and fresh.  Years ago, I was a big fan of the veggie plate for dinner but I haven't had dinner yet at this location. #2018Goals.",

We were on our way home from a Vegas getaway and decided to go here for breakfast. We came at an excellent time, (Saturday morning, around 9am) and there was no wait for us two. It started getting busy not soon after! My boyfriend got the biscuit French toast with blackberry topping and I got the Cracker Barrel Country Boy's Breakfast with sirloin steak. So much food at an unbeatable price! The biscuits were warm and fluffy and the hash brown casserole was so satisfying, it can be eaten by itself. My boyfriend's biscuit French toast was so yummy, the perfect cross between dessert and breakfast. Our server, Olivia was so sweet and wonderful, and made some much needed menu suggestions because we couldn't decide and wanted to order everything!   The country store is so cute, so much cool stuff for gifts, especially for the holidays. I really appreciate the local pride in the their teams, The Golden Knights and future home of the Raiders!   This may be our regular breakfast spot whenever we visit Las Vegas. I intend to visit as much as I can until I've had every single thing on the menu!",

The ham was SO salty, the biscuits had no flavor whatsoever even drenched in gravy. My pancakes were good but the rest of the food on my plate was lukewarm.

    "text": "So to be upfront I have been enjoying Cracker Barrel for over 40 years.  I grew up in the south and truly enjoy Southern cuisine.  I was excited to finally be living near a Cracker Barrel.      I have been to this location 3 times - ate in twice and got to go once.  I got breakfast all three times.  I always get the Sunrise Sampler as it has so many goodies.  The amount of food you get on the Sunrise Sampler is over whelming.  You get 2 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon, biscuits and gravy and also grits.  It is more good than I can eat at one time.  I use the leftovers to make a fun breakfast the next day.      The service is always good and I get the Southern Hospitality feel even here in Vegas.  The Country Store theme is so cool and I feel like I am back in TN every time I am at a Cracker Barrel.      They now have online check in to help with the long wait times.  I highly suggest getting their App and checking in prior to driving to CB.  Now I am craving my Sunrise Sampler - a visit to CB is definitely needed soon!",

    "text": "I've been to many across the country and really like this place NORMALLY.   I was so excited they finally opened in Vegas and have been wanting to go so bad.  I decided to come here last night with my daughter and son in law.  The menu is interesting, it's not what you would expect from a place like this.  It was limited, meaning they do not offer a lot of sandwich choices, their main dishes are varied and the food was just ok, nothing special and nothing like the other locations I'd been to in the past.  It was actually very bland and not tasty at all.  I've always liked their breakfast, will have to see their lunch menu, but the dinner menu, I was not impressed with and probably would not go back to this location for dinner unless there is an invitation I just can't pass up...meaning I would go for the company not the food.  This place does not believe in consistency at all.  My daughter and I both decided to order the same dish a combo sampler.  Meatloaf, chicken & dumplings, ham with your choice of 3 sides.  Once my son in law arrived, he decided to order the same thing.  When my daughters and mine came out it was like WHAT???  Two identical plates with two different portions???  One plate had a huge piece of meatloaf, one was a sliver and same thing with the other two items.  Two identical plates with two different portions.  When my son in laws arrived, different from the other two???  No sauce or gravy on the meatloaf, one small piece of chicken hidden under a lot of dumplings and gravy, the smallest sliver of ham not even worthy of a taste.  I even mentioned it to our server who just looked at the plate and chuckled??  Don't get me wrong she was an awesome server but really did not know what to say.  I don't think she knew what to do and just walked away.  I'll give this place a chance for lunch one day maybe, but as for this location, they are not consistent in plating and I will not go back for dinner again.  The food was bland and really not that impressive.  First time ever I heard my son in law not like his food either.",

    "text": "By far not the best Cracker Barrel I have ever been to.  A couple of reasons that I found for this.   1. This is the busiest Cracker Barrel in the system and the servers are pretty much overwhelmed most of the time.  They should make it larger and space the tables a bit farther apart.    2. This is trying to be a charming country eatery but none of the employees have any idea what southern charm is.  They have a clipped west coast flair that would be considered rude in the south.  The experience at a Cracker Barrel in Nashville is a completely different experience.   The food is typical Cracker Barrel.  Country comfort food with a mass prepared food flavor.   The gravy for the biscuits is good while it is hot but turns to paste when it cools.   The grits are a bit bland but turn to gelatinous goo when they cool.  Very off putting.    In general, it is southern comfort food cooked for the masses.   Either you like Cracker Barrel or you hate it, there is rarely a middle ground.  I am a fan of breakfast here back in TN, MS, and AR.  As for the Vegas location, I would leave it before I take it.   If I want southern comfort food, there are better choices in Las Vegas.",

First thing I ordered before anything was biscuits&gravy, never got it, wasn't charged for it. No big deal. (Although I really was craving it). We had to ask three different people for straws. Yes, straws.   Honestly food was ok at best. I wasn't expecting my world to be rocked, and it certainly wasn't.  Ambiance was nice, seems like a decent family restaurant. There is a huge fireplace in the middle, which makes it feel \"homey\". I really feel it's more like 2.5 star, but I'm being generous and giving it 3. Will I be back? Ehh, maybe?

I ordered the grandpa's country fried breakfast. It was pretty good. The hash brown casserole was my favorite along with the pancakes. My plate didn't come with pancakes but I got some off my parents and I highly recommend. The food was a 4/5 but the coffee was WATERED DOWN!!!!! I love coffee and making a pot of coffee is NOT hard. We got our coffee and we noticed it was very watered down so we ordered new coffee, our waiter said she'd be back with a fresh pot. SHE WAS NEVER BACK. It took like 25 minutes to get the attention of another server to get us coffee and she said, \"We've had a lot of complaints on the coffee, I apologize\". They brought out our food before they brought out our coffee. We were halfway done with our food when we asked ANOTHER server to bring us coffee because the other two didn't. She brought us coffee but spilled some on the table. She didn't apologize or clean it. DON'T GET COFFEE HERE. Our server never showed up again. We had to get the attention of another sever for the bill. POINT IS: FOOD WAS OKAY, SERVICE WAS AWFUL. I'm sure there are other similar places with better service in Las Vegas. My experience wasn't great.",

She had to deal with the mess ups from the horrible kitchen staff that repeatedly made mistakes.   We went for a birthday dinner and was told an hour wait. Ended up being about an hour and half which was okay because there was 10 of us. Diane was great with her service and very friendly. She went above and beyond. Very happy with her service. When our food came out they only brought two of the plates. 15 min later I finally asked a manger where the rest of our food was. 10 min after that they bring our food or what we thought was our food. Wrong table. It was another guests food. They finally bring the rest of the food, it was all messed up. Sides and wrong chicken. The server put the order in right she showed us the ticket. We waited another five min for the last plate which was a medium steak it came out extra well done. One end was bloody and red. Not medium at all.   We definitely won't be coming back anytime soon. Seriously this place needs to get it together. Thank you to Diane for doing the best she could. I hope his place gets better soon, I was really looking forward to Cracker Barrel :(",

I liked the sweet potato.....it was good too! Shanelle M was our waitress and we got great service. She was funny....we really liked her. This is a great place to come for comfort food and the service is good and we didn't have to wait long for our food considering how busy they were....I would for sure recommend this place.",

I had the chicken and dumplings but the best was the Mac n cheese as one of my sides. You get to choose 3 sides. Next time I'm just ordering my Mac n Cheese. The lemonade was refreshing and a nice change from carbonated drinks.  Madeline was our waitress she was busy, but must have come by around 3 times to check on us.  Bringing refills before we were emptied.    The country general store at Cracker Barrel offered a variety of items to purchase that won't break the bank.  It was decorated and organized .",

All three occasions my food has been either undercooked, overcooked and always bland. The wait staff was very personable but really doesn't know how to be a wait staff. On this last trip the waiter forgot one beverage, removed our salt shaker and sugar even though they were both full to refill them while we were eating (and took a while to return them, as he was carrying a tray of silverware after he removed them) and never checked to see if we needed any refills on our beverages or even asked how the food was. The only time we saw him was to give us our check. He didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. That seems to be a practice there at Cracker Barrel. So, in my experience, the food has been consistently mediocre.",

It took us months until we decided to come eat here because it is always busy. Finally decided to come here during a random time and luckily it wasn't so busy. My husband's favorite dish always is Saturday's chicken and rice. I love the dumplings and rainbow trout dishes but this time I tried the pecan crusted catfish this time and that was amazing! My go to side is always the delicious fried apples. They bring out biscuits and cornbread and by far the biscuits were my favorite! Glad to have this place close by to go to.",

They are very busy and I think they must make mounds of bacon and sausage and let them sit getting hard. My eggs came out wrong and had to send them back twice. No creamer for coffee only half and half...gross. Toast was thin and burnt as well. In short, not worth my $10 for sure. Going home to eat now......",

There were so many people waiting so I thought to myself it must really be great. The store is really cute so I suggest checking it out. We were finally seated. We ordered and everything was fine. The servers were really nice. I appreciated the service and positive attitudes. The reason for the 3 stars however is because the food is just not great to the point where I would drive all the way down there and wait an hour to eat. I got a salad. It wad standard but the chicken was dry. The cool thing was that it came with a devil egg rather than the standard boiled eggs",

They had a different server than our table, long story short they were finishing their meal and leaving as our food barley came out. And we were sat at the same exact time!!! In a city that thrives on hospitality, we hated the service here and WILL NOT RETURN! I hope management changes things fast!!!",

    "text": "There is a problem when a business is so popular or so busy that they don't care about customer service.    This is our first time here and I definitely do not feel welcome.  For starters the hostess never smiled once. The guy bringing us to the table never smiled.  Our server, Natalie, tried to smile but you could tell it was forced.    As we placed our order our server asked if we wanted \"baked potato salad or 3 sides\".  We hesitated because we didn't know what a baked potato salad was.  She repeated herself as of we didn't speak English.  (We understood her loud and clear, it just didn't make sense.)  So, we asked for the potato salad.  To which she asked what type of dressing.  We were confused so I asked why there was dressing on potato salad.  She reiterated by enunciating each word slowly, \"...I said baked potato or salad...\", which she did not.   Even after I explained that it was our first time she continued to explain what she said.  And never acknowledged us for it.    Towards the end, and probably because I already started writing this review, she became nicer.    Food-wise, I thought it was good.  But somehow when you get frustrated and irritated right after sitting down your appetite is ruined.   I MIGHT give them a second chance.",

Their pancakes are buttery and crisp, so delicious! Those pancakes aren't for the faint of heart (calories must be high up there) but they are so worth it. Their coffee is so good too!   The service was a little everywhere but they just opened and everyone's trying to settle in. Logan was very sweet and was helping our table out a lot even though he wasn't our waiter, which just goes to show how much the employees care .   Just like all CB locations, they have a country store where you can purchase a lot of great merch like Yankee Candles and even CB syrup, coffee and pancake mix (yeap, the same stuff they use in their kitchens!)   Would definitely return here, hands down!",

I suggest going to their website and doing the pre check in first. The wait can be long. This place is packed, so I can see a few hiccups happening still.  Our food itself came out late and the people next to us who were seated after us got their food first. Not sure if this was a kitchen error or if the server forgot to put our order in. A manager came up right away and said the food was coming out soon. A minutes later is when we got it. Food was good, but the sampler entree platter was a bit.... sad, the ham was cut deli style with only one small slice and the over all presentation of that dish was lack luster. I got the chicken and dumplings and it was great. The server dropped the check before we finished and we kinda just stared at it since we had planned to order dessert. Saw the server some time later and informed her that we wanted two slices of pie. She came back with them and informed us the pie was on the house due to the mistake. Which was a good thing since the slices were cold with cold icecream on top. I suggest requesting it warmed up since it ruined the dessert all together. Most like just order take out for the dumplings but not going back there for dine in.",

As my order arrived, i noticed a plate with little to offer. As i examined the burger i noticed a few things; the bun was flat and soggy, as was the lettuce, the cheese was astoundingly cheap, and lackluster in taste. Their \"thick cut\" bacon was almost a half millimeter thick, and the fries were extremely oversalted. The burger and fries were extremely disappointing, though the service was great. All in all, crackerbarrel is nothing to get excited about, and was quite a letdown.",

Every time we go on road trips to the East Coast and adjacent states of California, Arizona, Utah and Texas, we always look forward to seek out their stores. We love their food and their shops. We were so excited when this location was established coz it's closer to home. During the first 4 visits, everything was good. We got the same quality food that we've been used to having in their other locations. However, the last visit two weekends ago was a disaster. Their pancakes and steak were not the same as we usually have. When we mentioned it to our server, she said she has been hearing the same complaints from other customers. Had a recent chat with friend who also loves Cracker Barrel and she complained of the change, too. I'm doing this review for them to shape up and provide again the high quality food that we always expect from them. Giving 2 stars instead of one because of the very good service. At least, that is something they were able to maintain.",

    "text": "tl;dr - Trust me: There is nothing on the menu here that is worth the wait times, extremely slow staff, and the inconsiderate management.   I have managed to sit and eat here twice since it has opened, only because the first time we came only 30 minutes after they opened and an hour and a half before they closed the second time. If you visit anytime between those hours, you're completely wasting your time.   First off, the food is just okay. I cannot imagine waiting longer than 2 minutes for a table here. It is not anything you can't get at another restaurant chain or make yourself. Second, the wait staff is extremely slow, so you better ask for EVERYTHING you need the first time they come to your table because you'll never see them again until they bring you your check. Third, don't even bother placing a to-go order. I recently placed an order at 9am, was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, arrived at 9:25am and had to wait another HOUR before my food came out. I was in the process of asking for a refund when my food finally came out (or I would have just left). I politely spoke to the manager, just to give him a heads up on the lack of efficiency his team has in regard to to-go orders, and he literally laughed it off and didn't bother to accommodate me for the inconvenience.     I will not be returning to any Cracker Barrel location.",

    "text": "Damn... such a shame.  Was really looking forward to the opening of Cracker Barrel.  I've been following the feeds and waiting for this place to open for months.  Saw on yelp the lines were long and the wait times were 1-2 hours, I should've looked closer at the reviews prior to coming.   Went on a weds around 12:30, expected a wait which we were quoted 20-30 minutes which was roughly accurate, no issues there as it was expected.  Upon getting our named called for a table, we were told we'd be next up which took another 10 minutes, no biggie.    Seating seems to be fairly cramped and for literally building this place from scratch I have no idea why they limited the tables the way they did, but it is what it is, not my call.  So on to the actual experience, somehow we seemed to be \"lucky\" enough to be there while they were training some new hires, not just one or two, but we got three all in our little section that were following around someone experienced.  Doesn't seem all that bad at first, but we ended up with 6 people standing by our table every time we turned our head along with a creepy manager, bus boys and whatever other server happened to be walking by at the moment.  Not the most pleasant experience but I'd suck it up if the food was good.....   so on to the food... Having been to locations in other states, I had maybe an unreasonable expectation?  Being a chain I'd expect some type of quality control would have already been done to make sure the food coming out would be up to the company's standards, unfortunately I vastly over-estimated that.  Fiance got the pecan pancakes, super dense, watched her struggle to cut them, ended up eating one of them before just saying \"f it\" and was over it.  The menu and every other location pancakes typically will come with butter on them, hell even denny's, IHOP, Black Bear or any other place that serves breakfast will typically give you butter on the pancakes....The menu even advises \"real butter\" comes with it...  apparently not here though.  Ended up asking for some and instead of giving a nice little side dish with some they give her ice cold tiny packets meant for biscuits.   Oh well...   So on to my meal... ended up getting the special of the day \"chicken pot pie\" with a biscuit and cornbread ... having eaten at another location in the past, I was hoping for the best.  The chicken in it wasn't bad, wasn't anything special either though unfortunately.  The broth/gravy, not sure what it's called in there was pretty much non-existent, there was a nice layer of grease and oil though on the bottom that apparently was meant to take it's place.  I've never had a chicken pot pie like that anywhere else and I'm fairly certain there's a good reason for that.  Feel like I've had better one's in my younger days from the grocery store.  On the plus side the biscuit was actually pretty good!!  That was the one bright spot of the entire experience!  Cornbread was dry and after a bite I was more than happy to not have another piece of it.    So after finishing our meal and joking around about how we won't come back anytime soon, we go to pay for our meal.  The cashier asked how it was and me being a smartass jokingly said \"at least the biscuit was good!\" ... she took that as me complaining and said she'd get a manager as the only way they'd get better would be to hear the complaints, tried to tell her it's alright and I didn't mean anything really by it.... that really just feel on deaf ears and she called for the manager anyway.... *sigh* oh well, he's been called, screw it... So he finally comes up and my fiance who is usually super quiet and won't complain, voiced up about the pancakes.   I was shocked when the manager ended up being quite a dick about the situation.  Apparently in the cluster of the people around us he had come by and asked how our food was (really don't remember this, but oh well)... So apparently because she didn't voice it to him at that time, it's her fault the food was bad??  She even responded that she doesn't like to complain (which is very True)... Either way, was met with extreme attitude from this guy... They ended up comping the pancakes without much issue, really wasn't the expected result.  Honestly would've been happy just paying what we ordered and getting out of there.  Anyway... TL;DR version.... Not worth it to go.  No quality control over the food, it's just bad compared to the other location. After 2 months of being open servers don't appear to know what they are doing yet.  Manager is a dick.",

No one greeted me, and the hostess looked at me like she wished I would drop dead. Didn't say a word. This was already 100% different from any Cracker Barrel back east, where they are extremely hospitable.  Someone else came up to me in a few minutes and took me to a table.   There was silverware, but no napkins. ??  The waitress turned out to be cheerful if not very competent... she got my order wrong.  I've gotten the same breakfast probably 40 times and again ordered the same thing, but it was far from the usual. The ham was dry, the eggs overcooked, and the hash brown casserole was so raw the potatoes were crunchy.   When the manager came by and asked me how  everything was, I pointed out to him that the hash browns were cold and extremely undercooked, and he said Oh, I'll tell the kitchen.  He did not walk to the kitchen, did not offer to get me some cooked food... just ridiculously bad service.  Looks like they get their biscuits from food service and heat them up, actually I doubt much cooking goes on in this kitchen. They were cold and stale.  I would not eat here again if it was free.  Y'all need to go eat in Cracker Barrel in North Carolina and see how it's supposed to be done.  Shame on you.",

    "text": "I went on monday with my girlfriend and friend. The place is decorated really neat. We were seated quickly without wait. Waiter was friendly and took our order and made a few suggestions.  The food was bland and not so good. I made a trip to the bathroom before desert. My girlfriend said it was much better in North Carolina but this will be my only visit to this restaurant chain.",

    "text": "The wait was long, service slow, and the food was not how I remembered it from the Cracker Barrel in Arkansas.  My husband got food poisoning from the gravy.  The kids' breakfast meals do not come with a drink and, when ordering, the waitress asked each child if they wanted bacon or sausage making it seem like part of the meal.  When we got the check all sides were an \"add-on\" and charged extra.  The only thing I like about this place is the store, that's it!",

    "text": "My husband and I had gone to Cracker Barrel in the past in a different state, and were thrilled when we got one here in Las Vegas! We already knew about wait times and expected it. Not a big deal. So far, 5 stars.  The server was nice, well groomed, took our orders fairly quickly. So far so good! Then our food finally came out. I asked for more sweet tea please! I unrolled my silverware, very obviously sticky and dirty. So I grabbed someone and finally got a new set. No tea , but ok. Oh wait, there is almost no gravy on my mashed potatoes, can I have more gravy please? What? You want more gravy? I ate my whole meal, except for the mashed potatoes - oh here is more tea! Yummy! (Not really because it tasted like dirty hay) finally got the gravy, got the check before my hubby could ask for desert. He made sure to get it! A manager came right before we left, I wrote \"Bad Service\" on the back of the ticket so they would at least see that. He saw that and was all shocked. Ok look. I've been reading through the reviews. This place has bad service. The management should not be shocked. He offered to pay or do something- I said no thank you and went and paid our check and we left. The food was good. :)   A suggestion of the management should read this. Go to Lucille's for dinner. Take notes. They work like a team. They have awesome service!! They are packed as well. Oh and get that tea for your clients. :) it is heaps better tasting! I know what sweet tea is supposed to taste like, not like yours. Lol!! Have a great day!!",

    "text": "We have been to several Cracker Barrel's across the country.  We waited about 50 minutes for a party of 10 on Saturday morning 10 AM.  Lunch starts at 11 AM, but breakfast is served all day.  There were four mistakes with our order, but I will still give four stars because the value is that good.  Only paid $105 which includes tax and tip (6 adults and 4 kids) and we were stuffed!  Mistakes - gave us fries instead of mashed potatoes, forgot onions for a burger, forgot apples for a Sunrise sampler, and eggs were scrambled as usual instead of \"lightly\" scrambled as ordered.   As soon as we told the server, he brought out the needed items.   Other service notes - brought 10 biscuits to start and they were gone in a flash (party of 10), then took about 15 minutes to bring more - our meals actually came out before the second round of biscuits; had to ask a couple of times for gravy  Food was delicious overall!  We will return.",

    "text": "Wow, I have been to Cracker Barrel's all over this great United States of ours, have had some of the greatest meals in my life. But this Cracker Barrel is in trouble, I had one of the worst meals in my life. My chef salad look to have been put together using the cooks feet. The staff was on organized, chaotic with zero communication skills. The manager was running around like a chicken with its head cut off not knowing which way to go or who to attend to. Corporate better get involved with this one or it will be a short-lived. You would think the first one in Vegas would have a little more experienced staff running it. To say I was extremely disappointed would be an understatement.",

    "text": "Absolutely 100% disappointing . I have been to other locations in the past and this one didn't impress us at all. Coffee is weak, tasted like tea. Over hard eggs were not even over easy, the yolk slid out almost raw! My scrambled eggs and hashbrowns were lukewarm at best. The gravy with the biscuits was lukewarm. The french toast lacked flavor. Completely unacceptable. We won't be back. They need to get this temperature issue taken care of for people's safety. The temp control back there is all off. And we weren't the only ones who have had these issues. I don't know why they are struggling so bad. I don't mind a 45-50 min wait for amazing food and service, this wasn't worth it at all.",
