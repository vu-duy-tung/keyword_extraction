    "text": "NEVER AGAIN!!!   Went there on 7/18/16 for our anniversary because neighbor gave us a gift card. Place was extremely busy. We thought this might be a good thing - fresher food...?  THE GOOD: Waitress was friendly and fairly attentive, eggplant parmigiana was tasty (though the slices were the thinnest I've ever seen), house salad was the bomb. Wine was good.  THE BAD:  Our table was a rocker (waitress fixed), and it was located in a corner area that seemed to have no air-conditioning - had to keep wiping the sweat from my brow - not to mention that a woman at the next table had a walker that she refused to move even though she knew it was in the way of my husband sitting comfortably (he would've moved to another chair but table was so close to the corner the extra chairs couldn't be pulled out). Calamari appetizer was disappointing beyond words - no flavor and pieces were no bigger than my pinkie, though basket looked full, at least half of it was just pieces of the coating - no calamari in them! Chocolate caramel lasagna for dessert was awful! The layers of cake were so stale, it tasted like cardboard.   THE UGLY: The bill --- Even with my free dessert coupon the total was over $59, before gratuity. One entree (all I wanted was salad - which came with the entree), 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine, over $59!!! I can hardly get my mind around that - not even 2 meals - almost $60. For that price everything should've been excellent.    As I already said - NEVER AGAIN. Go here at your own risk.",

Their soup is good too so every third or fourth visit I skip the salad and get bowls of their hot, steaming, delicious soup.   Mostly good service. They're on refills pretty good.

    "text": "The Olive Garden is always a decent choice for mainstream Italian. Don't get me wrong, if you're looking for something more authentic, this is not your place.  Starting with the appetizer, my wife and I decided on the fried mozzarella and fried zucchini combo. It was the first time I've tried the zucchini and I was shocked at how similar these are to Carl's Jr. I would put a decent amount money that they are 100% the same. Extremely strange to see this at a restaurant of this quality. For those of us who love fried zucchini, in my opinion, Cheesecake Factory takes the cake here. Pun intended!   I had the grilled herb salmon with garlic broccoli and it was pretty decent. Salmon was slightly over cooked but nothing to complain about.   My wife had the Lasagna Classico. She's a lasagna eater and she said it was bad.   Lastly, we always get sangrias and went with the berry. I enjoy sweeter sangrias rather than tart. This was tart. Obviously this depends on the wine its made with.   Sorry no dessert to talk about. We take care of that somewhere else.",

    "text": "I said I wouldnt be back, I lied. Decided to take advantage of the never ending pasta bowl special they have right now. They only have it twice a year. So here's how it work. You choose your pasta (fettuccine, penne, linguine, angel hair, corkscrew) then pick a sauce (Alfredo, marinara, meat, five cheese) and any add-ins (meatballs, sausage, chicken, shrimp) for an additional cost. The first plate is regular entree size. If you finish that and want more, you can order the same as your first order or mix it up and order something different. FYI the second and any additional servings are smaller and served in a bowl. Also included with the meal is unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks. If you don't leave full, that's your problem. =)   I ordered the angel hair alfredo with sausage and salad. Bf got the spaghetti marinara with meatballs and soup. The food was good. I tried one of his meatballs and I definitely prefer the sausage, but that's just me. BTW it's $2.99 for sausage or meatballs, but you get 2 each serving so it's a good deal. I ordered pumpkin cheesecake to go, and it was just ok. I wouldn't order it again and for the price of almost $8, not worth it. Our server, Juan, was excellent. He brought the food out in a timely manner, checked up on us often, and was really nice. I'll be back.",

Toilet was not even able to be used due to its lack of maintenance. Had to leave restaurant to go use toilets at Wendy's.",

I called the restaurant immediately and they were so nice and accommodating. The gentleman I was speaking to did everything he could to make it up to me. I love Olive Garden, I crave it often. I usually use  Postmates, but I was already out running errands and decided to just pick it up before I went home.

    "text": "This used to be my favorite restaurant in town. I used to go here for all special occasions and any day I didn't feel like cooking. I've been a loyal customer for years and now I will no longer eat here anymore. I ate here about a week ago(March 6) First off I get walked to booth #52 which was dirty. So we go back in the waiting area. Then when it was clean get walked back. Which wasn't too big of a deal. I work at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. I know how it works. I wasn't upset at all until I hear 2 servers arguing over who was going to take care of our table. Neither of them wanted to take care of us because I had \"2 kids\" with me. Typical stereotyping that we won't tip or that we'll be cheap. After arguing for 10 minutes finally a server walks up to us and obviously annoyed says \" I literally just got sat so I can start you with some water for now\" and walked away. 10 min later a new server takes over I think his name was Hugo. Takes our order (by now I've been waiting for 25min) . It took more than half hour for me and my kids to actually get our food. My kids had lost their appetite by then since we've been here for almost an hour now. Food had no flavor. It was cold. Disgusting. We literally left all the food on our plates. The server disappeared so I never had the chance to tell him I didn't like my food. I waited so long without seeing our server that I figured out how to pay the bill on my own through the little tablet they have on the table. Left no tip. And left. Sad thing is I'm a server. I'm a good tipper. But I got stereotyped and given bad service. It was very unprofessional to argue about not wanting me in your section! The restaurant wasn't even THAT busy. At my job when it gets busy you see us servers literally running back and forth. Here there was no sense of urgency. And even if the server is overwhelmed it should not affect the kind of service you give your guest. Very disappointed. Not only did you miss out on a good tip but lost a loyal customer.",

    "text": "Olive Garden has been around for as far back as I can remember. I've been eating at this place my whole life, and while their food is nothing short of excellent, other elements of the restaurant leave a lot to be desired.   First and foremost, the food. It's great. Olive Garden's Italian cuisine is far better than that of most other \"chain\" restaurants, and their prices won't break the bank either. I don't think I have ever come to this restaurant and not thoroughly enjoyed my entree. There is something for everyone on their menu - soups, salads, pasta dishes, italian sodas, desserts, it's all here.   However, this location's service leaves a lot to be desired. The wait times are often ridiculous, even for a party of two! The employees are always friendly, but sometimes lacking mentally. One time, when I was seated in the cafe area, the waitress took our order without even writing it down. Minutes later, she comes out with a salad when my girlfriend clearly ordered soup. She was nice and corrected the mistake promptly, but said she \"though [my girlfriend] said salad.\" A, you should have written our order down. B, the words SOUND NOTHING ALIKE. Additionally, there have been times where they have been very slow in bringing out entrees/drinks/etc.  One thing I DO like about the restaurant, however, is that managers frequently come around and ask if everything is good. This way, if there IS a problem with your order, you have someone you can convey it to. They often give you the opportunity to perform surveys regarding your service, offering discounts on future visits for doing such.   Olive Garden has great food and I will always eat here. However, don't come in here expecting the best of service.  Food: A Service: C+ Atmosphere: B+",

He came to our table at least 3x the whole dinner and took about 7 minutes to retake our order because we wanted something else. I am very generously giving them 3 stars as the food was really good. I ordered the Tour of Italy and the portion was plentiful. I couldn't even finish my  order and had to bring it home. But at least he sort of made up for by giving us a whole bag of that awesome breadsticks! I will for sure be going to Olive Garden again, but just not this one.",

    "text": "Hi Sam (general manager) my name is Diane. I was a guest at your restaurant in the afternoon. I have to say I was quite disappointed at the service, and quality of the food. We are weekly guests at the Nellis Location and felt that we would receive the same or better service at your location. I would like to start by saying we were a party of 5. We weren't offered a wine sample, we were then greeted by Rumel. She went off to say what would you like to drink and stated she hoped we all had salad because it was easier for her. Once we gave her the drink order I explained that I was on short time that I needed my order to be put in along with our salad and drink order so it could all come out at the same time. She said ok and left. When she came back with our drink order our salad was not as ordered I asked her for the missing items and extra dressing. She then had to confirm our order, she stated she couldn't even read her own writing. We were never offered cheese the first or second time around. Then about 10 minutes went by and she noticed we were just sitting there with our plates full of salad she asked if everything was ok at this point I said well we need cheese, and refills on drinks please. That took another 5 minutes. After we were done with that our order was still not out. She then came out with a tray that had only 5 plates and out of that only 1 of them on that tray was ours. She stated that the \"manager\" was placing the food on the trays and they didn't know what they were doing. She then left again and about 10minutes later someone else comes out with 3 more of our plates. So we still have 1 person with no food. And guess who that one person was? Yes me the person that told her that had short time on her hands. So once it comes out again it is not how we had ordered it but since I had 15mins to eat I just ate 2 spoonfuls and boxed it up. Should I say again no one was offered cheese once again. When she noticed that I was irritated by the whole ordeal she offered me a drink to go and said I could pay on the machine on the table. She walked away and didn't see her again. So we paid and of course didn't receive any mints or was checked on again. I am so surprised this even happened to us and I had no chance to talk to a manager or even yourself! That is the reason why I called you as soon as I left the restaurant. I am very very disappointed and if this happened to us at a \"green valley\" location.  And for the record have not heard from you since I left the message.",

    "text": "Today's review is for a place I've visited many times before: Olive Garden on Sunset Rd. The restaurant was busy but I did not have to wait long for a table. Fortunately I missed the usual lunchtime rush.  The hostess, Danielle(?), after making me wait for what seemed too long while she finished tapping away at her computer display, merely looked up at me and waited for me to say something. Perhaps she was tired due to the hour? I requested a table and was seated at a booth in one of the dark and cozy rooms. The restaurant areas I visited seemed clean but the decor is dated; the table was set with four rolled-up sets of eating utensils & napkins as well as the previous guest's check and payment.  After a few minutes, my server, Kalecia, came by to get my drink and lunch order. She was efficient, nice and a bit \"matter-of-fact\" (perhaps she was tired too). I had Soup, Salad and Breadsticks -- my usual business-day lunch. I've always liked the salad at OG (something about the dressing and the way the fresh ingredients are prepared and presented) and today was no exception. The Chicken Gnocchi soup is usually good (though there are too few gnocchi and chicken morsels to really make it exceptional). The breadsticks had just the right amount of garlic seasoning today (sometimes they're just too bland) and were served warm. With a slightly watered-down soft drink, tax and tip the tab was just under $14.  I'm not looking for a five-star experience when I go to OG -- it's more a desire for some comfort food served in comfortable surroundings by friendly staff. I may be old-fashioned but I expect the hostess to greet a customer with \"Hello! Welcome to Olive Garden! How many in your party?\" or something like that. Other than that one minor issue, I had no complaints and I'll visit them again. I've read that OG is trying to freshen its image as well as the decor of its restaurants. This restaurant is definitely showing its age but I can't complain; so am I.  -- 3.2 comfortable stars",

Of course the gluten free food will matter to me because i am a food junkie and since I can't have gluten or Dairy the taste is extremely important to me. Beware that the gluten free food is pre made, packaged and just heated when you order it, not ok by any means. Gluten Free food needs to be made fresh and served right away, especially pasta. The pasta was extremely hard and I had to return the food. Normally I would just suck it up and eat it, but this just wasn't okay. If they were to reheat it, it would just become more hard. Moving on to the Positive side, the service was amazing. My family and I went late and stayed late ( far after they closed) we didn't even notice we were too busy laughing, talking, sharing stories ETC. The staff didn't mention a word, they kept serving us with a smile on their face. When I finally looked at the time, I was shocked. OMG ITS TIME TO GO, LIKE NOW! I said loudly. The staff laughed and said it was ok, but we were a bit mortified. We quickly paid and packed up and left. I could tell the staff was tired and I'm sure ready to go home but they were so polite and tried to be more pleasant than i could really imagine being. If you don't have to eat Gluten Free, really go! My family said the food was delicious. Gluten Free Foodies beware!  =]",

    "text": "My in-laws came in to town in order to catch a flight out of McCarran. They do not live near an Olive Garden any longer, and were really looking forward to a treat before they left.  Olive Garden used to be a really a pretty decent place to take your family. The salad and breadsticks are always tasty, as they were this time as well. Our food was just okay though .Colin was our waiter, and he was really great. Attentive and seemed to really enjoy his job.  I got the Ravioli di Portobello. When it arrived, it looked as though it sat too long and 'died' in the window. The cream sauce was starting to look separated. It was not steaming hot by any means, but it was warm enough. Barely. I chose this dish because it had sun-dried tomatoes as part of the sauce. I could not tell that there were actually sun-dried tomatoes in any part of this dish. There just was no depth of flavor, it was all just heavy cream sauc-y. I should have used my lemon from my drink to squirt over the top of my meal. That would have brought out the flavor, and I am still kicking myself for not thinking of that sooner.  My husband chose the Chicken Scampi, and only because others had highly recommended this dish. This also looked like it sat too long in the window, and seemed somewhat dried up. It also probably could have used some fresh lemon juice added to it. My in-laws got the Cheese Raviolis with meat sauce. My husband had some of theirs, and he said it was great. He liked it much better than his chicken, and said that it had great flavor.   My favorite part was the little dessert cup, the chocolate dolcini. THIS was wonderful. I liked that it was a creamy mousse cup that was chilled and had little chocolate shavings on top. It was just the right size, and had great flavor. There was also a lemon flavored one as well as a tiramisu version.  Not in any hurry to get back. It is very loud and somewhat cramped in the restaurant. The food was okay, but just okay.",

The hostess was very friendly. Our waiter, Kory, was personable and professional. He offered us a free wine sample which my husband gladly accepted.   I love the Moscato Primo Amore wine they offer. It's my absolute favorite wine. If you haven't already tried it, you must!   I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it had a lot of sauce which most places don't do. I loved it.",

Our server was really nice and patient since she was serving about 10 of us.   I ended up getting the Tour of Italy because I couldn't decide between a lasagna or Alfredo. I was pleased with the unlimited salad and breadsticks that are included when you order an entree. I get my food without waiting too long. I liked the Alfredo and the lasagna was okay. I mean how good can non home cooked lasagna taste right, but the food I do not recommend is the chicken Parmesan, it tasted burnt and mainly was just batter. I didn't end up finishing it. If I could order one thing I would just stick to Alfredo, you can't go wrong with it.   In the end it was a good dinner. Fast service, friendly server, and subpar food. It tastes as good as the price is.",

We tried something different than what we usually order. The food was great ! The only thing that sucked was the experience with our waiter. It was slow at the time we were eating, but at first I realized I left my ID in the car, so I wanted to go get it to buy drinks and try wine samples. My friend brought hers so she was able to do that, our waiter literally insisted multiple times that I didn't need to go get my ID. The other thing was that we got the unlimited salad/soup and thought we would get re-fills but we didn't even get that not even breadsticks and some of the comments the waiter said were supposed to be \"sarcastic\" bc he said multiple times how he was being sarcastic.. but I didn't like the way he kept making sarcastic comments. He couldn't even re-fill my water since the only drink I ordered was water after he kept insisting I didn't need to go all the way to my car to get my ID to buy drinks . Maybe it's just this location, the other Olive Garden's I've been to, I didn't have an experience like this.",

    "text": "Every couple of years I have an Olive Garden craving. After a long day at work I knew OG would be a good choice. It's a huge draw that they serve salad and bread before the meal so I know I can go in hangry and get food fast. The dining experience is also somewhere in between fast food and sit down dining so the entire meal can be wrapped up quickly.  Even with a packed parking lot we were seated right away. Our waitress came by quickly and took our orders. The bread and salad came out quickly and our meals came out not long after that. The speed at which food arrives would make this a great option for those with little ones. Our waitress checked in often and was friendly.  The food is the main reason for the three star. It's not bad, but it isn't fresh cooked food either. The food to me is similar to heating frozen food from the grocery store. There are several options in the area that would be significantly higher quality and taste for only a little more money.   Overall, Olive Garden is constantly busy because they fill a certain niche. The service is consistently good, no reservations are required, the food arrives quickly, and the food is decent.",

The real entertainment came when our waitress went MIA for a good 15 plus minutes to cater to a large group, and another waitress there felt bad for us and took our order....  when our waitress found out, her face and attitude changed toward us and the other waitress... became like territory wars, and was made to feel like I made the mistake of not waiting for her to come back....  Then got to hear the run down about a group who divied their bill six ways as an explanation...  Service was okay other than that.  The pasta was watery, and you REALLY have to ask for sauce...    This place did the reverse of what you would ever hope of a chain restaurant... food got worse and the price went up.

We had salad, bread sticks , and the fettuccine Alfredo as the main dish.   The salad was ok but i guess it would be kinda hard to mess up a simple salad, the bread sticks were hard and tasteless. As for the fettuccine it was ok nothing I would brag home to mama about Ive had way better it reminded me of something I could microwave from the grocery store no flavor at all I had to put a pound of salt and pepper on it just to make it ok to eat.   I will not be returning to Olive Garden this is Las Vegas there are way to many good restaurants to eat at rather then waste my time at this fake \"Italian restaurant\" not to mention the service was lousy.

    "text": "The OG has quickly become one of my favorite chain restaurants.  Ask my friends, I wasn't in love with this chain restaurant until very recently.  Having been a fan of pasta since my younger days.  Nowadays, I'm more open to visiting this place and I've been taking full advantage of what they have to offer.  I LOVE THE OG!!!  My bestie and I decided last minute to come here so we could try something new.  It's all about trying everything on the menu.  Let's start with the soup of my choice, the Zuppa Toscana!!  This soup is on point!!  Spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy broth.  Usually for $6, but comes with your meal if you choose the soup option.  Lots of sausage in the soup, the potatoes are cut thin and the greens are crunchy and offers a great texture.  I love it.    For dinner, I decided to try pasta for the first time in a long time and get the Seafood Alfredo for $16.95.  Sauteed shrimp and scallops tossed with creamy fettuccine Alfredo. I was surprised at how good this was!  The Alfredo, I know is not that good for you.  Probably heavy whipping cream, butter and all that is unhealthy, however it tastes so delicious.  The scallops were smaller but perfectly cooked and so was the shrimp.  I had to take home  half of the plate because I had to many bread sticks and soup, but even the next day, the fettuccine and shrimp were still good.  I was satisfied :)  The only reason for my deduction in rating is because of our server.  I can't remember her name but she was very sloppy.  Her uniform was super dirty and so was her service.  Whenever she asked for cheese, she didn't give us the option to say stop. She turned the grinder upside down and cranked.  Problem was, she did it over the table so cheese went all over the table.  When she was finished cranking, she just poured the cheese on top.  Not the experience I was looking for.  Whenever we got our soup, the rim of the bowl was covered with food because she held her tray sloppily.  My last observation was that she set down our check and then threw down the mint chocolates on the table.  So sloppy!  As a former server, I wanted to say, \"get it together.\"  All in all, If you're like me and haven't enjoyed pasta or the OG in the past, try it now!  I did and I'm so glad that I was able to change my mind.  The OG will have a special place in my heart from now on.  Come down and visit them!",

I've been to this location at least once a month for years sometimes more and there is no consistency to the meals.  sometimes there is more food sometimes less last night it was less and I literally had to stop for food on the way home since his plate didn't satisfy my son.  Sometimes the bread sticks are perfect sometimes they are over done my point is this a chain restaurant and I shouldn't have to be concerned about the food and a every visit basis this used to be the place my family and I would go to for family time dinner but I may be rethinking that.  Now our server last night was amazing she made the borderline food more tolerable",

Oh and that awesome little Andie's mint I get with the bill. Plus, I don't mind getting a free sample of wine here and there. That's where OG's have earned their two stars.  The reason it's lacking the other 3 stars is due to a couple of things. First, there's always a long wait on Friday and Saturday nights (which I understand) however they don't have very good turnover and they don't quote their wait times accurately. Second off, I have encountered some less than pleasant staff members that I could simply do without. And lastly, their prices keep creeping up and up. I could go get some bomb, scratch-made chicken fettuccini alfredo at Montesano's for the same exact price as Olive Garden's pre-packaged tasting dishes. Meh .",

Super nice.   One lady complained that he didn't ask for her ID, but did for her friend.  Another had been late to pick up her order so requested new drinks since by now they were watered down.  The manager, a short haired blond lady was so kind to her & even issued a $15 gift card for fixing that drink order.  There were a couple of other incidents that I found ridiculous in a very short amount of time & thankfully I do not work there cause in this scenario, a few customers were not right.  Everyone at the bar treated them so kind, too kind.  Anyways, I ordered a drink & left in thirty-five minutes, as I killed time before the movie, had no food & sat at the bar.",

It took a while for our waitress to come get our drink order so we ordered our entrees at the same time, might as well save her one trip. She wasn't very attentive... our table kept accumulating plates and she kept putting more without taking the empty ones.  I don't usually complain about food taking forever to come out, but it took unusually long for our pastas. It was literally two of the same pastas (two kid's chicken Alfredo) and an order of mushroom ravioli. The ravioli was okay, maybe I'll stick to their lasagna.   For dessert, we got this dessert shooter things. Forewarning, they are REALLY sweet. I can barely finish one without regretting each spoonful.   Eh, I don't think I'll come back unless someone REAAALLY wants to go.",

We checked the phone app and it stated there was no wait for 2 people and when we got there we immediately got a table.  By the time we left, it was a 50 minute wait and the waiting area was packed!    My cavatappi with traditional marinara and garden veggies was wonderful.  I could not finish it so we took some home for my husband to enjoy for lunch on Monday.   The salad we shared and breadsticks are always great.  I didn't have wine but was given a sample and it was good.  Loved my raspberry lemonade.  Last but not least, Luisa our server was amazing!   Very attentive and friendly!   They continue to get it right---which is why this place is always busy---great food, great service, reasonable prices!",

I haven't been to one of these in several years, but it's not hard to see why they are so popular: service is quick and friendly, ambiance is nice, and food is a great value.  My wife and i walked in and had what turned out to be a 15 minute wait. No problem: sat at the bar and asked for wine and some fried risotto and were promptly obliged. Did i mind that the sauce tasted like Ragu? Not at all considering we paid $7 for the deal.  We did not order it, but a special part of the menu offers 'buy one take one home' as an option... something an italian place could only pull off, probably (i think Maggianos does this too) and a great value. Also, unlimited breadsticks and soup/salad with an entree... In any other restautant, it would seem like they are just asking to lose money. I suppose the economies being realized with the vast and powerful Olive Garden chain allows them to get away with this.   Basically you will love every part about the OG if you weigh everything you are getting with what you paid for it: nothing's great... but it's all great for the money.",

It order was larger and it even came with a Soup it Salad. He filled out drinks promptly, he even asked us for approval to fill the kids Sprites which I assumed is because it was Soda.

We asked for more bread sticks but she never brought them out.  We asked for our check twice and when we finally got it we said \"thank you\" and our server said \"Ok.\".

Once we arrived on Saturday night at 6:50pm the said there are no such thing as reservations on Friday, Saturdays & Sundays.. I was very upset because the person the day before took all my information down and never informed me that reservations were not allowed. Which in my opinion is not a great idea considering like the girl said its your guys busiest days which would only make more sense to allow reservations! The told us it was going to be an hour wait for 10 people which is understandable but also I was so upset because I called ahead of time for this specific reason, especially because someone could have informed me. On top of that the girl that handed us the little machine that goes off when the table is ready responded with \"let me know if you change your mind so we don't wAste the time getting the table ready.\" That was so rude of her! It's to bad I didn't get any names. The server although was amazing and waited hand and foot on us. But we discussed that we will not be going to this location again because of how rude the customer service was up front, especially because they could have been a lot nice considering we had to wait until 8pm to be seated even though I had called ahead of time.",

Pasta is what 99 cents a pound!?) . We ordered Chicken Parm and thought the pasta portion was hysterical for the price. Mainly because a real old school Italian place will give you enough to share with family or just take home. So to us it was pricey for 12.00 or whatever it cost.  The waiter was fabulous, he was really on top of things. The atmosphere was great, the seats are uncomfortable.  What Olive Garden has is an A+ in marketing. They stuff you full of a simple salad, and bread so you won't notice dinner is kind of a rip off. The salad bowl is shaped a certain way to make it look huge, all kinds of stuff like that. I have to hand it to them though they are a total genius at making people thrilled over very little. For the Olive Garden fans glad you enjoy it, but it just does nothing for me. Admittedly I was spoiled by old school Italian cooking from my Grandfather.",

But because it is a fun place to dine ... and you can get a good meal for a decent price... and WHO doesn't love garlic breadsticks....   They are handicap accessible this earns them a giant star... Especially since I am not able to get around very easily. They put me in a place that I could easily get IN and out with my knee walker (I will be so glad when I don't have to have it anymore)   Then we sat down and ordered ... We started with peach sangria-  then lasagna fritta... (this was my favorite thing of the meal) They brought it out and it was like lasagna noodles that had been stuffed with ricotta cheese and then breaded and fried ... they have a cheesy sauce on the bottom and a marinara on top . They are chewy and crunchy at the same time. They are sooo good i would have eaten them for my lunch only.   However we ordered chicken parmigiana - with salad.   The salad was crisp and fresh - and was not over saturated in dressing.   Then we had the chicken parm...  Everything was really good and the service was good also :)",

The fettuccine Alfredo had very little sauce and was piled so close to the Lasagna and Chicken Parm that it ended up with too much tomato sauce in it.   The Toscana soup was very salty and the bread stick definitely nuked.   I ordered a sangria which was so sweet I squeezed the lemon and lime garnish to cut the sugary flavor.  Not at all happy",

Wish we got her name... but for manager's reference 9.28.15 around 5:30pm whoever this girl is give props ahahahha  We just wanted to kill some time before our next movie so the hubby grabbed a glass of wine & I got some soup. I convinced my man to come here by saying that PROBABLY have a TV at the bar... I was WRONG... he was DISAPPOINTED as being FOOTBALL season... he could only check the scores on his phone. I understand it's a family resteraunt... but DEFINITELY would say at least one TV at the bar top area would PROBABLY bring in slightly  more guests especially during football season... ahahhaha (at least the girls would be able to convince their man to go eat at olive garden or something)  ZUPPA TOSCANA SOUP $6.49 - I ALWAYS get the toscana soup here... & the fact that you can get UNLIMITED amounts of it is AWESOME!! plus it comes w/ complimentary yummy warm bread sticks  STRAWBERRY PASSION FRUIT LIMONATA $3.50 - a large drink I would say... very refereshing & not toooo sweet since there is that tartness & sparkle   TRAVIS & the girl (really wish I knew her name ahaha) conversated w/ us & they were pleasant & got us everything we needed & answered all my stupid questions  We also noticed little tablets EVERYWHERE! You can order apps. Desserts. & drinks from this thing which is pretty nifty. It also has little app games for $1.99 maybe to keep the little ones distracted.",

The waitress arrived at the table took our drink order asked for our id's which were fine. Now it was the ACTUAL DAY of my birthday okay. We placed a order for appetizers which arrived fairly quickly, after our drinks. Now here is where the problems start: 1) Dinner was not good at all, my carbonara was warm not hot,cheese and oil was coagulated ugh. 2) We had to ask for the check three times and they were not that busy. 3) Our check was $130.00 with everything we ordered. Was going to give $ 30.00 tip but because of crappy food and service very low tip given, and I ALWAYS tip good when I go out. 4) I was WEARING A \"Its MY BIRTHDAY BANNER\" and our waitress did not bring any birthday dish and no one sang, after we told her it was MY BIRTHDAY before our meals were delivered to our table.  Was so disappointed because had went to lunch about 2 weeks prior and had excellent food and service, but this time it SUCKED !!!",

The Server was J Martin we where a larger party of 8 plus a high chair. They set us in the back room with a even larger party next to us. Our server was very rude to  me and one other member at our table because we did not order a meal just soup and salad. He was not friendly to either one of us, even the other members in our party noticed how rude he was to us. I did not want to get the manager involved since it was my son birthday so we eat and left. Hopefully this server can change his ways and not be rude to the ones that don't order full meals, not everyone is hungry to eat full meals all the time. He made me fell very uncomfortable eating their tonight so it will probably be quite so time before I want to go back there again.  Also his helper or another server that was helping him I was the last of my party to pay the bill the bill since we broke it up when he returned my change he through the black folder on the table in front of me and all the change went flying over the table in witch my son watch this happen as well. I wish I had his name that was very uncalled for. If he was my employee he would be enjoy so time away from work and some work Ethics classes for his actions to a customer. You do not through stuff at your customers or on the table I  front of them. Something needs to be done for his actions.  Hopefully others have noticed the actions on way these 2 employees treat your customers and training is applied, because like I said my family has been coming here for years and I would like to continue to enjoy going here but. If this behavior continues and spreads to other members of your team, my family and I will  never return.",

To have a good experience, while nice, is simply forgettable. It is the rare bad experience which leaves the lasting impressions. That is what makes it so difficult to review this Olive Garden. It is consistently solid. That is not to say it isn't without its faults. A couple of times I have gone in for lunch but was not given a lunch menu. These times were on weekends and holidays. I asked if they were not serving the lunch menu do to the specific day but each time they apologized and brought me a lunch menu. I am grateful for that since it was lunch I was craving in the first place. My lunches, whether I get soup, salad or some part of a duo, are always the same quality I have learned to expect regardless which OG I am visiting. What stood out in the positive on my most recent visit to this location was the iced tea to go that my server brought me. On a hot July day that was very much appreciated.",

In the dark light of the bar, gave a credit card, signed the check, eager to take the food home to my wife, believing that Olive Garden would deliver their usual value for price.    This morning, in much better light, the check is for 2 LOBSTER ravioli for $41.  I called the store, explained the order and check to the manager, and asked if he thought the price was right.  He spoke with the person who took the order, and was told that \"additional raviolis were included\".",

U will usually wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. There is very limited seating inside the restaurant to wait.  So most likely u wait outside for a table. They dont take reservations. Not even for large groups or special occasions. The food is sub par. The prices for drinks are super high. Even for a coke or sprite. Go at your own risk.",

We got seated right away as soon as we asked for a table. The kid activities books was well made, and it kept my 5 year old busy for a good 20 minutes. Our waiter was pleasant. Food came out very fast.  I like it that we got soup, salad, and breadsticks to start. My two boys love the chicken and gnocchi soup. They dipped the breadsticks in the soup, and it was so yummy.  To make it even better, unlimited refills on breadsticks, soup and salad . Salad was simple, and refreshing. We ordered calamari, chicken margherita, chicken and shrimp alfredo. (I forgot the name of this dish). Calamari was good. Portion is not small. The two of us couldn't finish the whole calamari order. By the time entrees come, we were already 70% full lol.  The breaded chicken in chicken margherita was very good. The breading was airy, crunchy, and paired well with the tender chicken breast and marinara sauce.  It was overall a great dining experience with quick service, yummy food, and everyone was pleasant.",

But there's so much pasta in one dish that you can't eat more than 1. Meat is extra.. everything's extra.. of course. So thinking we would spend under $30 it was more like under $50 for two meals. :/ oh well we tried. I recommend this for someone who can eat a lot. Or maybe athletes who are trying to carb up.  The restaurant was busy of course. We didn't wait longer than 5 mins to be seated.. we didn't wait long for our food, and our waitress was nice and speedy. We had a Italian Margarita. It was really good. They used amaretto instead of tripe sec.  Highly recommend!!",

It was a large group and the waiter seemed a bit overwhelmed at times.  I searched vegan options before coming to see what kinds of things I'd be able to get at my friends party.   Read that the breadsticks and pasta with marinara and salad are pretty much the only meat/dairy free items on the menu.   When the salad came, there was pepperoni, and it was slathered in cheese.  Which is ok I just passed on the salad.  Opted for some breadsticks and pasta with marinara.  The marinara was sweet and reminded me of the canned Hunt's spaghetti sauce I would buy when I was broke and in college.  The pasta, well, kinda sad, a mix of mushy and al dente with a few random pieces of fettuccini.   This leads me to believe that all the pasta on my plate came from a pot with multiple pastas in it.  Hopefully it was True to no animal or diary products in it.  The breadsticks were just as I remembered, fantastic !   I could eat 10 baskets of those.   So a decent place with middle of the road expectations.  Not super stoked, not disappointed just kinda like eh ok.  The best part was meeting some new people and celebrating my friends bday.",

Hostess walked us to the back right dining area and it was almost completely empty! That was extemely upsetting. It seemed like a total ploy to have all these people waiting when there was no need for it. (Mind you i had come with two toddlers under 5 and didn't have time for these shenanigans)  The waitress was kind. But because of the sudden flow of customers all at once into the empty area she got busy real quick. We ordered a lasagna and then my mom mentioned a commercial for Olive garden about buy one and take one home. Our waitress failed to disclose this information and any other specials they had.   I would advise that the employees should acknowledge the patrons of any specials going on. She mentioned for me to notify her near the end of which one i ended up choosing. After finishing she brings. Prepacked to go order of the buy one take one home item and it was completed cold (almost as if it was frozen and just started thawing out) which was surprising.   I ordered the Salmon Picatta and it was good. The lasagna was pretty dry and not enough sauce. Kids meal spaghetti tasted like spaghetti \"o\" sauce and the chicken tenders were really dry and over \"cooked\" (microwaved too long).   It's sad. I use to have fond memories here but now the food just seemed very mediocre and way over priced.   The highlight of my dinner was the fresh salad and always consistent breadsticks fortunately. If i were to come again definitely just ordering salad and sticks!",

I ordered soup and he ordered salad so he served me some salad on a small plate.  When the bill arrived, I was charged $4.49 for having salad.  I asked her to get the manager, who took the charge off my bill.  My friends and I have always shared the salad even if some of us order soup.  Most servers ask if we need extra salad plates but I have never been charged until today.  I will probably eat at another location next time since there's one on every corner.",

    "text": "We all know what food to expect from Olive Garden and that's why I love it.  Consistent quality and food I think is delicious (I know some people disagree on that part).  However, today's review is really about the service.  I was feeling like Olive Garden but just wanted it to-go so I called in a pick-up order.  Kalley was the server who answered the phone.  I had seen the order one and take one special on Yelp and in their e-mails so I asked if it was available on to-go orders or only dine in.  First nice surprise - available on to-go orders. Kalley then took the time to explain the 5 dishes featured on the special and what each contained.  She gave me all the details and didn't rush at all.  I could hear in the background that they were busy but she didn't push me into picking the first item so she could get off the phone.  Additionally, after taking my order Kalley asked if I would like both dishes hot or if I was saving one for later and offered to give it to me cold so I could put it straight in the refrigerator for lunch tomorrow...great idea!  I was told 15-20 minutes for the food and they had it waiting for me when I arrived.  Kalley had three other people arrive for pick-up at the same time but had us all checked out and out the door with our lunches within 5 minutes and did so with polite conversation and a smile.    It's not that the service is usually bad here but this was an especially good experience!  Thanks Kalley!",

We walked in at around 645 PM on a Thursday and it was packed. The hostess didn't greet us, she just let out a solemn \"30 minutes, name?\". We asked about bar seating and they said that it was first come first serve. At that point we saw two seats open up. Boom, we were in business.   We sat down and ordered a couple glasses of wine. The bartender was busting his ass. He had a full bar and he was making drinks for the rest of the restaurant. He took the time to recommend two other bottles of wine for us and even gave us a half glass to try! We naturally did the all you can eat salad and my lady friend did the soup. I had an awesome Parmesan Crusted Shrimp dish.  In truth, I normally don't write reviews for chain restaurants unless it's a bad experience. The waiter that helped us was so impressive that I opted to write this one up.  Service was 5 stars and food was 4.",

    "text": "I'm surprised to see all these positive reviews.  Everything started out fine.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Employees were friendly.    When our server brought out the salad and plates, something smelled awful.  My daughter realized it was the plates.  They smelled like an old mop.  It was making me gag so I had to move the plates away from our table and call the server.  He brought us new plates after a few minutes.  I figured he was having a hard time finding clean ones, but I appreciate his effort.  Salad was good.  The breadsticks had a weird flavor.  It was as if they were expired prior to cooking, or if they'd been sitting in a cooler with rotten food and absorbed some of the yucky smells.  I was half expecting Ramsay to come out and close down the restaurant.    Our entrees arrived.  They were tasteless.  I had the smoked mozzerella chicken - which tasted exactly like the fettucine alfredo.  I didn't understand how you can make sauce without ANY flavor.  And I mean absolutely NO flavor whatsoever.  It was mindboggling.  Mystery solved when we received our take-home entrees.  Their foods are frozen and prepackaged like a tv dinner.  As simple as it is to boil some pasta and make simple sauces, they don't make their foods in-house.  Received a round of refills at one point but they didn't bring mine. I had to steal my daughter's drink.  I expected this level of quality from Fazolli's, but expected more from Olive Garden.  I guess that's why we haven't eaten there in 6 years.  At least the employees were friendly.",

When I was walking up it looked like it was closed already because there were so many open tables. Then to top it off we asked the hostess if we could order breadsticks while we wait and she said \"breadsticks? What's that?\" That's remarkable that the hostess has no idea what a breadstick is in the restaurant known for breadsticks and salad. Wow! Definitely needs new management because whoever is running this place now is ruining the Olive Garden brand. I'd recommend going to a different location, even if it's further you'll probably have a better experience.",

Having to wait only 10 minutes or so was a PLUS!   I sampled out the Moscato they had for the day and really enjoyed it! Our server was sweet and friendly took our orders efficiently and went about her business. Now once we got our dishes that had been served by the runners is when it became a bit of a waiting game. Drink refills, bread refills, the soup refill, Our server hardly served us once the order was placed.   It was the Hubby's Bday so my daughter approached one of the hostess to see if they could sing happy birthday to him. We didn't want him to expect anything so they where all great to join in on this plan. After our meal they came out singing with a mini cake good enough for 10 slices! The cake looked good but once you took a bite it was so dry not even the kids finished their slices. They also charge about $9 to do the whole thing. Most places bring out a slice of cake and sing at no cost. I don't care to pay the extra charge but they need to serve cake that is at least edible.   Finally when we had our left overs packed up by our server I was shocked to see her grab the breadsticks straight out of the basket and place it in the bag. I have never left an Olive Garden where they didn't package the breadsticks in the oven safe bag. They usual ask if we want fresh breadsticks to take home but not this time straight into the bag without proper packaging.   I have had way better experiences at Olive Garden.....",

    "text": "I have been coming to Olive garden for years. Tonight has by far been the WORST visit we have had. Took about 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge our presence. Parties that were seated well after us had already ordered and had drinks and salad before we talked to a server. Granted our table was dead center of the dining room so being non visible was definitely not the case. I could go on and on but if I were the manager I would drug test our waitress because something is definitely wrong with her. The food was ok. We received our soup and it was warm at best but this isn't kitchens fault I think our waitress forgot about it and it got cold sitting on the shelf. Overall a very disappointing end to a great evening spent with my parents visiting from Texas.  We will return to this Olive Garden but will ensure we never have this particular server again.",

We sat at the bar, and the bartender was great- he was very friendly and attentive. My boyfriend and I shared the lasagna, always a good classic choice, we of course had the ever popular salad and bread sticks to start. Overall our experience was good!",

    "text": "Me and my wife were feeling fancy so we decided to go to this Olive Garden location as it was the closest.  We were sat down pretty fast and our drinks came almost instantly.  I had the iced raspberry peach tea which was pretty tasty.  Our breadsticks and salad was good as usual and we even got the Alfredo dipping sauce for our breadsticks that made the flavor even more great.  I decided to order the Tour of Italy which included Lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmesan.  I was awaiting the meal that cost me $18.50 and when it came I was less than impressed.  The chicken Alfredo was crisped black and way too crunchy yet this part of my tour was the best.  I did find a way to enjoy it after but then the lasagna came along which tasted like a freezer burn piece of garbage.  It had an awful taste and was cold in the very center, it ended up looking like mushy baby food.  Then the fettuccine Alfredo came along which wasn't terrible but was absolutely bland.  My wife decided that she needed some dessert to complete our meal so we ordered the the dolcini.  It is a mousse substance along with different flavors. They were quite good and I did enjoy that.  Overall it was a terrible meal which ended up in total with my wife's food 60 bucks.  The service was nice but that did not make the food any less gross.",

The caps were dry and glued to the bottom of the dish by hardened cheese. Asked the person who brought them out where our salad was. \"Um, who's your server?\" Now the main course. Two ordered the Eggplant Parm, one the chicken Parm. Eggplant was cold. Skin had not been removed. Chicken Parm tasted like it had been dredged in salt. (and I like salty food but this was over the top!) The ravioli and pasta that came as sides...the edges were dry and hard. All three dinners were luke warm. The service. I have not tipped less than 25% in years. Tonight was 8%, more to send a message. The server (bus person?) that brought out the mushrooms was rude. The only thing the waitress did was take our order and bring drinks. $66 for three people SHOULD have bought a decent meal.  We would have done better if we had gone to Cici's pizza and paid $5 each.  We were in the restaurant at 4:45. It was not busy.  The only reason I am giving one star is that that is the lowest I can go.",

I haven't been here in years (maybe a decade)   We ordered the sampler with the stuffed mushrooms, cheese stick, and calamari. The stuffed mushrooms have a hint of crabs which was absolutely delicious . Cheese sticks were pretty good but the calamari was definitely boring. We made note to Maureen our server, she got us a brand new order of spicy calamari that was extra crispy it went from a 1 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10.  It comes with a great salad and lots of breadsticks. I don't remember much about the entree because I was stuffed by the time the entree came. I took a bite into my entree, just to verify I liked it.   This place is surprising good for being a chain and if you get Maureen as a server, you will be delighted.",

The moment our drinks was near empty, our server acknowledged our empty glass and brought a new one as well as any additional food orders in a timely manner.

    "text": "Came here 11/11 (Veterans Day) just before 8PM. My husband & I walked in, and was a waiting area full of families who were waiting to be seated. We asked the hostess how long the wait was and she stated it would be at least 20 minutes, but the bar area was open seating. We took a peek and found a booth that was available.   About 8-10 minutes went by and a female server named Marie came by to take our drink orders, an iced tea & a Prosecco for me. We ordered zucchini bites on the Ziosk table top tablet. Another 5 mins went by and a gentleman by the name of Hugo stopped by our table to take our food orders. I ordered the Steak & Gorgonzola Alfredo, a dish that I really enjoy, ($20 entree nonetheless), and asked for them to leave the sun-dried tomato off of it.   Ten minutes later Hugo returned to deliver the drinks, and awhile passed before our Zucchini bites arrived. They were bland, the tomato sauce served on the side was cold. Eventually my Toscana soup arrived and it was watery, as if they had added water to make it go further. Service was slow, but I assumed it was because they were giving away free meals for Veteran's and I was understanding.   Then an employee was complaining near by that there were overstaffed with four bartenders on and brazenly would just stand there in front of guests just fixated on the TV's in the bar area watching TV whilst ignoring guests. At one point while our server was completely M.I.A. this guy was just leaning against the back of my booth staring at the TV. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing, but he kept going up to the host stand trying to get \"phased\" (was a black gentleman), and obviously did not want to be there. Meanwhile our table hadn't been cleared, no refills, and he just stood by idle.   I asked Hector for chicken gnocchi soup when he did finally return and it ended up coming out after someone else served us our entrees. I began eating my pasta, and it did not taste the same as it has before. I ate a few more bites and it just was very bland, and then I realized the balsamic glaze they add to the steak was left off.   15 minutes had went by with no one coming back to check on us. Hugo came back eventually and I asked for the glaze. He came back, but 20 minutes later the pasta was cold. I poured the glaze and still it didn't taste right. I waited & waited and he never returned until much later and asked if we wanted dessert, we declined & he pulled up the bill on the Ziosk tablet and offered us boxes, I had already given up on eating my entree and pushed it to the side. As I looked over the bill it all made sense, he had rang in my entree \"no tomatoes, no cheese\", and apparently that's why the chef left everything off.   A manager was never visible during our entire meal, otherwise I would have expressed my disappointment with the experience. As I used the restroom before we left, I was absolutely shocked by how disgusting the restroom was, not stocked & just plain filthy. They say you can judge a restaurant by the state of their restroom, well the restroom was a byproduct of laziness & it perfectly matched the rest of our experience for the evening.    Inattentive service, unpalatable food, and given the fact I never saw a manager, I assume the manager is at fault for all of the above aforementioned. Worst experience honestly and I couldn't help but feel ripped off once I got home from a nearly $75 meal (adding in a cash tip because I felt bad for Hugo & assumed it was a rough day for him). Ugh.",

He really takes care of his customers.  When I just ordered for coffee for my drink, he also offered a glass of water.  He gave me tips on what customers usually put on their soup, like Tuscana with cheese.  He offered a different soup to try when I did not know it is unlimited, without extra charge.  When I told him I am on a lunch break, he brought out my 2nd entree without me asking! I could go on and on about how awesome he is and how he goes extra mile when other servers usually don't care about those small details.",

We only had to wait a few minutes before being seated because we came in at a weird time (2:30-ish). We both ordered soup, salad and breadsticks with chicken gnocchi soup. We also paid the high price for the Alfredo boat for out breadsticks. There were actually a decent amount of gnocchi in the soup this time and it hit the spot. The absolute best part of our visit though, was Travis. He was absolutely delightful and so fast and helpful. He never came by the table without a smile. If we go back, we're going to request to be seated in his area. Thank you, Travis.",

I order the never ending pasta which the way my stomach felt after never ended. Ugh! I had ordered the Cavatappi with Asiago Garlic Alfredo and Crispy Chicken Fritta. First off the pasta could have been cooked a little better, secondly the sauce was already separating when it was benign served, and the chicken wasn't cooked all of the way. Boooo! Unfortunately chains rely too much on their big name. I ate about half, probably shouldn't have, but then waited a half an hour for my server to return. At that point a just asked for a check. She didn't ask if everything was ok, if I wanted a box, or if I was interested in desert. Oh well, won't ever be going back there.",

Both times we were offered a free sample of their house wine, first time the Rosata (my favorite) and then the white one the second visit, which I was only able to take a couple sips - The Rosata is a winner and I am now on a hunt to find it out of OG so I can have it at home whenever I want. Ordered Endless Pasta and hubby loved his angel hair, alfredo, meatball dish and I always get the corkscrew, meat sauce and sausage - yummy.  Servers were wonderful and helpful throughout refilling our drinks, soups and bread, always checking on us and even packed up leftovers.  It's too bad others have had not so great experiences here, luckily I haven't had any problems with my visits - hopefully this keep up.",

    "text": "I can say that for the first time in forever, I no longer wish to eat at Olive Garden. I've always found myself as a fan, but my experience last night made my desires sour. We were seated next to the kitchen, so close you could essentially make your own food. Not only that, I was given persistent attitude from the waiters when I asked for something as easy as a refill. The food was nothing short of sub-par. I found myself paying nearly $20 for what I thought was going to be three dishes on three separate plates. It was called \"Tour of Italy\" and the name \"Little Italy\" would've sufficed.... The portions were almost as if tasting the pasta before I got the full meal. Olive Garden's quality and customer service has begun to decay and I will not be eating here again.",

I hope that more people will ask to be at her table so management will see that she does good work. The lasagna was really good, but seemed smaller than the last time. Maybe the cuts aren't all the same? My friend got the shrimp and chicken carbonara, that was really good. And of COURSE I tried it! You know me, I have to see if the grass is greener on the other side of the table. Haha.  Anyways, make sure to look into the \"all you can eat\" pasta. I almost got it. Had to ask Jessica for the special menu that tells about the all you can eat pasta as the server didn't give it to us.",

Went with my 3 kids and husband, we told the waiter we were ready as soon as we sat down, food still took 30 min to come out, they sat us in the worst place next to a computer where they kept leaving trays with dirty dishes for long periods of time. I got bumped on my chair 3 damn times and I wasn't even sitting wrong! I'm Pregnant and even turned my body (not the chair) to the side after the second bump. Got up to use the restroom 2/4 in the women's were disgusting with crap and the trash was over full, I couldn't stand the smell. Walked out let the hostess know she smiled and said ok. 22 min later I went back with my 5 year old daughter and bathrooms were the same! I ate one bowl of soup and order another and waiter seemed annoyed I even asked! I left it there on the table and sat outside with my girls to wait for my husband and son to finish their food to leave. $68 tab plus tip for that nastiness isn't worth it. It's your busiest times (graduations) don't expect ppl to use disgusting facilities and be hit while trying to eat and sat next to an area employee leave trays full of dirty dishes!! Never have I seen this take place at Summerlin location.",

I chose the chicken piccata with grilled zucchini and breadsticks with marinara sauce for the side I chose minestrone soup.  We brought it home and I enjoyed all of it. Take out at curbside is great! We had a nice young man who delivered our food to our car. He was friendly and attentive as well as efficient. I like this location of Olive Garden as it's close to our home.  One of these times we will dine inside. It's always busy at this location so that right there says a lot about this restaurant/location.  The food was delicious, fresh and hot. The chicken piccata had a lemony, creamy texture. It was to die for! Awesome dinner on my birthday! Thank you Olive Garden!",

Sorted without a wait!  Of course we had to get those piping hot bread sticks with a cup of the salad dressing for dipping (see the Rip and dip video) 5/5. We ordered the cavatappi with meat sauce 4/5 and one of the new stuffed pastas the asiago tortelloni with traditional marinara sauce 4/5. As always the meals come with soup or salad so we got both and shared, minestrone soup and hand tossed salad with fresh cheese sprinkled on top.  Service was quick as usual when you sit at the bar. You can also sample wines if interested.   Until we meet  again my breadsticks!",

Their garlic bread and salad is so fresh and soft!  We tried their Asiago dish and it was superb! The plate was hot, but that kept the dish warm and that was my favorite part.

So for the most part I only go there when ever they have a special, like Endless pasta bowls or Buy one take one home deals.   This location has plenty of parking even during the busiest time of day. I've never had a problem finding a parking space. Should they ever be completely full there is a parking garage behind Olive Garden and parking in the parking lot beside Olive Garden.  Wait time here isn't too long, at least not for small parties of people. I've waited maybe 10 minutes at the most during the weekends. Hostess at the front is very friendly and checks you in promptly. The ladies that seat you always ask how I'm doing and seem very pleasant. If the person that is going to wait on you is busy, the hostess will usually take my drink order while I wait.   My waitresses here have always been very friendly and helpful with any questions that I have. They verify orders before putting them in to make sure you get what you want.   I usually will get the Fettuccine Alfredo, but this last time I tried out their new lasagna. And I always get a salad and garlic bread. Everything comes out fresh and hot (if you order something hot like pasta). Salad is okay, nothing special about it. The dressing is the best part about it! Pasta is always delicious and we'll seasoned. I always leave feeling satisfied.   Will come back again to this location.",

I didn't have to ask for a single thing, she was checking on my just enough without being annoying.   I came in a tank top and a hat, because I just got back from a beach club, but Morgan treated me as if I were wearing my three piece Gucci suit. I felt so respected and like a VIP.

Our waitress, Inez, was not only very sweet and caring, but also speedy and fast. I highly recommend asking for her as your waitress!  Before being seated, we waited for only a couple of minutes which was a sweet surprise, hence the restaurant had a fairly good amount of customers. After ordering, we were given our soup, salads, and breadsticks which were plentiful. Our food hadn't even come out yet and we were full! It was just food after food after food. Utter heaven! The food was marvelous other than one flaw which was that it was a tad bit flavorless. (This is why my review is 4 stars.) Continuing, the pros bypassed the one con by a lot and I'm very grateful for that. After the savory food, we shockingly had room for dessert, so we ordered and ended our night with delicious sweets. All in all our experience was brilliant and we will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "Olive Garden, the place that Hawaii peeps first go to once they come to vegas and never been. Why we ain't got one in Hawaii Still???  Well this time it wasn't my choice. My friend who moved to vegas for 2 years still hasn't been to Olive garden so we decided to go.  The best thing about Olive garden is the unlimited soup/salad with your entree choice. On Monday thru Thursday between 3pm to 5pm there's a special dinner duo cost for $8.99! That's a steal even if you gotta choose the 5 entree on the list. We got there 10mins before 5 and our server was very nice to trying to get in the order quick.   We also ordered 2 choice appetizer to share, we got the stuffed mushroom and fried zucchini. The stuffed mushroom has small clams inside and drenched with butter and cheese... I wasn't a fan.. but I liked the fried zucchini.   I ordered Eggplant Parm, this is my go to dish everywhere!!!!! I love eggplant parm. I got soup to go with my entree... forgot the name but it was pretty good but lots of basil. Loved my entree and I was amazed I finished it all.   My friend ordered the 5 cheese ziti and soup... his soup looked more creamy than mine and the ziti was oh so cheesy!   Service was great, our server was very tentative and wonderful.",

The shrimp is unusual and there food is just weird. I decided to stop coming and then I had to meet someone here the other day. My kids didn't want anything besides sprite and a vanilla ice cream. I got salmon which was ok and parmesan garlic butter broccoli. Well first it was just some raw broccoli and the waiter tells me that's how it is and it's only a little seasoned I won't be able to see it. Mind you when I ordered I asked for it to be really sauteed. I told her I can see it's not sauteed, not flavored or anything and tried it, of course it wasn't. Then she takes it back after tellin me that it was correct and comes out a few minutes later saying, \"oh there was a missed step.\" I thought it was weird how she really tried to tell me that it was correct and seemed to make me insist on taking it and cooking it correctly. My nephew didn't eat his food either, he said the chicken tasted extra chewy and gross.   I really like how clean there glasses are! They are really clean and I like their yellow napkin things!",

Positives: Server is nice and wait wasn't bad.  Negative: I asked the server if she could substitute clams for shrimp in the seafood fettuccine.  I was told no, because all of the food is pre portioned for the dishes.  I don't think it is that difficult to take a pre portioned  bag of clams and place it into a saute pan!   Two thumbs down for management and Darden restaurants for allowing a server to actually explain that to me.    Thank goodness the server is nice!!!",

She warned us that if for any reason we to step out then we wont be let back in. I thought our evening will be ruined. We were hungry and didn't want to risk dragging two kids out in the cold.  To our surprise the rest of the staff inside were great. Our server (I forgot her name) was very gracious. She gave us time to choose and enjoy our meal. The food was served quickly, the main course came out right after the appetize was served.  Our server apologized for it and we said we actually appreciate the quick service because the kids are already hungry.  There were still occupied tables of dinners finishing their meals. None of them seemed to have been hurried/rushed by their servers and neither did we.  We appreciate that so much considering that it was Christmas eve and they were already closing. With that we left a good amount of tip for their excellent customer service. Merry christmas!",

Didnt hesitate to start a conversation but wasnt trying too hard to impress us. He had good recommendations and we ended up only paying $80(without tip) for 3 people. Idk if this is cheap for Vegas but that's definitely cheap for where i live, in hawaii. My bf got the trout dish which was AMAZING. My friend and i shared the 2 for $25 deal which is a serious steal! You save between $10-20 at least. Totally overdid it with the second salad though we could barely eat our entrees lol. Eric brought and packed most of our stuff for us. Its nice to see people who actually enjoy their job.  We left him 25% tip without thinking twice. Eric, THANK YOU for ending our vacation wonderfully! Hold on to him OG!!!! Will be back next year!",

Now to the real reason for my review....i have frequented Olive Garden MANY time throughout the years and have always enjoyed it. However, over the last 5 years I have chosen to eat there maybe once a year. This is due to the increasing prices and I no longer feel that the food is worth the exorbident prices. I want to challenge Olive Garden to make their prices more reasonable again...when I pay 12.00 for soup and salad, something is wrong here...i am a buyer so the value of things heavily determines my decision to give you my business. It is disheartening to see this restaurant put the $$ in their account above providing an all around great experience for their patrons at a lower profit margin.",

I was told the wait for a table would be about 30 mins, however we were surprised the wait was only about 10 mins..!  Our server was super friendly and attentive. Refilled our drinks right away, brought out a larger portion of the salad, and split the entree in 2 dishes since we were sharing. We didn't have the 2 for $25. We ordered the calamari, chicken marsala (for my mom), and tried the shrimp scampi for the first time. Overall not bad, it hit the spot for what I was craving tonight.   The only downside is the location. It's a bit out of the way from my side of town. I live in the southwest; this location is in green valley.   Overall I would recommend this restaurant and will most likely make a repeat visit in the distant future.",

We was put at risk for food poisoning!! We complained and asked for our  bill and felt obligated to stay . The next round of food was even worst it was burnt .

    "text": "Went for dinner last night.  They do not take reservations so I planned to get there a little early (meeting two other family members there).  Put my name on the list and was told 20-25 min but table was ready in 10.  It was still only me and I offered to move down on the list until the rest of my party arrived but they suggested I go ahead and be seated.  All staff encountered were friendly and attentive.  Our server came right away and took my drink order and brought water for the table.  She also offered to bring bread while I waited.  I ordered the make your own pasta with whole wheat linguini, primavera and grilled chicken.  Was very happy with the dish except that the chicken portion was about a half breast-- it would have been a five-star dish if the chicken portion had been reasonable.  This was our first time in a long while at an Olive Garden.  As my husband was looking at the menu, he noticed that the steak item had been changed from a T-bone to a sirloin steak-- that was what he was looking forward to ordering.  Olive Garden has definitely downgraded in order to save money.  Too bad they didn't adjust prices and keep the quality.  My husband had the lasagna which he was disappointed in and will not order again.  I did not try it but it was not visually appealing and looked like a very small portion.  My brother had one of the seafood selections and was very happy with it.  The minestrone soup was very good and was served nice and hot.  We split the black tie mousse cake which was excellent.  All in all, we were happy and will return.",

One of the biggest flaws was the Gniogi In the soup was never found except in my second serving but even that was crappy Because when I didn't get any gnocchi I only got one or two pieces Of Pasta. Then the tea that I got that I asked for more hot water an it took a while before I got that and a few more things etc. I mean I understand that it was somewhat of a busy restaurant during that time but going over a certain limit of time was not fun. Yet The risotto balls are great that's all I can say.",

We ordered 2 appetizers as a main course. Even told her it was the main course and what happens, one of them was brought out early because she forgot to click a button on her screen. Couldn't find our server half the time.  Because we were a party of 8 the tip was already on the bill.  Way to much tip taken for crappy service.  Perhaps that's why we were treated the way we were because she knew it was a guarantee tip.",

Kudos also go out to the manager on duty (Angelique D.) she stopped by our table and we had a very nice conversation with her.

We were seated quickly and drink order put in as well as food order our waiters name was Ramon or something with an 'R'  I wouldn't remember being as every time we saw him it was brief. He put in my food order in correctly by putting the chicken marsala as my main entree which I am 100% sure what I had ordered sounded nothing like chicken being that I don't even eat poultry and when I had noticed the mistake I pointed it out to what I had ordered and he proceeded to tell me it was the shrimp ravioli that I had ordered and every time I answered back he kept changing his answer to what each item on my plate was.. It was pitiful he wasn't even comprehensive of what the food on the menu was supposed to look like he only filled our drinks once  we ended up fixing my order and taking it to go, because by then I was over trying to get decent customer service out of him he was way too concerned with all his other patrons that were pretty much finishing up... Don't be a waiter if you can't multi task and definitely read back the persons order if you didn't get it the first time it saves the and definitely food... We will be taking our buisness to the cheesecake factory.",

So she asked him to get her the rite one! Then we ordered our food and we ordered a full size order of spaghetti for the 3 kids to split and asked for extra plates! Well my order got to the table and he brought a kids order of spaghetti and no extra plates then he said he would bring out the rite one! Then he grabbed the cheese shredder and asked if I wanted shredded cheese and started to grind it and dumped it on to the floor and filled up my new shoe with cheese! Then everyone at the table had empty drinks and he walked by our table 3 or 4 times without asking if we needed a refill so we had to ask for a refill! Very poor service and my kids always look forward to the minute they give you at the end of your dinner which we also never received or an apology for any of the mistakes! We will probably never come back to this location! We have been coming here for over 10 years and I would not be surprised if everyone that Hugo serves food too does the same thing! I just hope that management does something about it before they lose any more customers ! Stay away from HUGO section!",

Well they have change the recipe. It used to be creamy with a little spice, now it's cheesy (like just melted cheese) and totally bland. The bread was also burned on the edges and it was a total waste of money. I understand that corporate has tried to rebrand their image but you do not need to fix what isn't broken.

    "text": "I'm giving this location 5 stars solely based on the service provided by our server John. The service that he provided was beyond superb. He greeted us immediately, asked for our drink orders and offered the complimentary wine upon sitting. His friendly and welcoming demeanor was impeccable and deserves a 5 rating. He went above and beyond in explaining the menu, what specials were new, what the popular choices were and even went in to his favorite dishes. I've been to Olive Garden plenty of times but having a waiter like John who clearly loved his job and was happy doing his job made this experience a different one.  I feel like great service is often overlooked. Yes, when given bad service someone would gladly write a negative review on their experience but often good service is overlooked and not recognized.   Olive garden is a place where you leave feeling like you get your moneys worth and feel like you made a great restaurant choice. My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday afternoon for lunch was seated immediately. My boyfriend ordered a \"Cucina Mia\" and created his own pasta bowl. This was a great because:  * You can choose your own pasta: Rigatoni, Cavatappi, Spaghetti, Tri-Colored Vegetable Penne, Whole Wheat Linguine, or Gluten Free Rotini.  * Choose your own sauce: Five Cheese Marinara, Traditional Meat Sauce, Asiago Garlic Alfredo, Garlic with White Wine (topped with fresh tomatoes and garlic) or Primavera (Basil garlic marinara with a blend of fresh vegetables). * Choose your topping: Meatballs, Italian Sausage, Chicken Meatballs, Grilled Chicken, Crispy Chicken Frittatta or Sauteed Shrimp.   Olive garden is known from their awesome bottomless salads, soups and amazing breadsticks. I've been to many locations where the food was always good and has tasted the same. What made this experience a 5 star experience was truly John's service.",

My boyfriend and I are very patient customers so when she forgot to bring out my peach mango smoothie and his lime drink halfway into us eating our appetizers we were fine with it. She always kept posted on us and communicated with our needs very well.   I ordered a Chicken Scampi and I added Shrimp and my boyfriend ordered a Rosemary Chicken. It was so good! The Rosemary chicken plate was pretty small portion wise but my scampi bowl was big. I ate a fourth of it and got very full. They have their buy one and take one home deal again for certain types of pasta's - starting at $12.99! Wish they had this deal with more options from their regular menu though.   At the end Kim packed our food and we paid on their convenient tech device that is at the table. Also, this device pad lets you call your server, order things, let's you explore the menu, and take surveys!   As someone who likes to dine in, eat, and check out quickly, this restaurant helped me do so. I will be back soon (thanks Kim)!!!",

It was a little busy, we waited around half an hour to be seated which we didn't mind at all especially knowing we were a big group (5 of us). As soon as our waitress goes to greet us she has the worst attitude you could ever imagine. She doesn't take the time to let us know about the menu and she seems like she hates her job overall. One thing that really ticked me off was that due to my friend not able to speak English very well I ordered for her and the waitress seemed offended by that? She also got mad because we wanted to split the bill into two different checks!  Guess she didn't want to go through all that extra trouble. I wish I could remember her name but sadly I don't. Olive Garden, please check your staffs customer service! I'm definitely iffy about going back anytime soon!",

They have specials limited time only if you buy one starting at $12.99 you get to take one from selected menus home for free, does not include salad or breadstick for the 2nd one.  We ordered steak gorgonzola, seafood lasagna, and chicken fettucini alfredo. They were delicious!. I like the fact that you can pay from your table with a credit card.

When dining in, especially on busy nights, we try to check in on line. It cuts down on the wait time in the restaurant, which is helpful when you have children. Right now they are renovating this location, so things are in a bit of disarray. Customer service is still ok though, nothing exceptional. Waited awhile to get drinks and refills a couple of times, but over all, nothing to discontinue coming here. Food is always good and cooked well. We will continue to dine in and take out!",

( yup, I was right ) I guess, stick it to the people to pay for it! Waitress didn't ask if we wanted a wine sample nor did she take the glasses away. Seemed like she was always in a hurry and everything was \"funny\". Ordered the spinach dip appetizer and it came out ( after we received our meal ).Bread wasn't really toasted and looked NOTHING like the picture. ( which I undstand but, come on ) looked like just melted butter just drizzled on it. So, we asked for different bread for it. One that was toasted like it was suppose to be. Came out toasted but, just drizzled again. Whatever....just let me make it! The wife's meal was real dry like always even tho she always ask for extra alfredo sauce and the garlic was just about raw! Don't want to keep going on because, it's  no use. Just falls on blind eyes and deaf ears. They will keep making their $$ regardless of what I say. Especially charging outrageous prices for soda, tea, etc....example: $3.49 for just a freaking glass of raspberry tea. So, two people two drinks just to start: $7.00.  Um, don't think so!!  At the end of this lunch disaster the waitress asked: \" how was everything\"? I said, what do you think? You can see what was left. We have had better I told her.  ( I don't like being a jerk but, when you pay over $30. for JUST lunch and it sucks, you get the point ) Oh well, enough rambling we will just stay home and make our own for a hell of a lot cheaper!!",

I had remembered Olive Garden being reasonably priced in the past.  That was not the case this time.  We ordered off the new menu and got stuffed pastas.  One entree was $22 and the other was $18.

    "text": "We eat here very often and this time the bad experience took the whole cake. The waitress was very rude first off. When she brought out the salad and breadsticks, the salad bowl was only filled 1/4 of the bowl (not even 2 plate full of salad). Usually your bowl is full of salad! We ordered a second bowl and came out the same way and this time the lettuce looked wilted. Gross! We ordered and my fettuccine Alfredo barely had any sauce so I asked for some and she said she would have to charge me! Really? My pasta is supposed to have sauce!  Ok so forget this, she made the date night really horrible. I went to pay my bill on the table device and noticed that there were extra charges. We mentioned it and she said she would look at it at her station. She came back and said she didn't see it and that we must not have looked at it right, really so customer is always wrong to her. I looked at it again and she removed the extra charges that were there but yet we were treated as if we were lying. Ridiculous! We were about to leave and we over hear her talking to 2 other employees. She pointed over at our table and told them that we didn't tip. For 1, I did tip even when she didn't deserve 1 penny. But how can you complain about customers where they can hear you. No professional at all!  I don't think I will be returning to this location until she is handled.",

The manager actually came over after I complained and told me the same thing. He then said \"I can bring you some lettuce with oil on it.\" That was his recommendation, not we have many other things that dont have onion. I was really shocked that Olive Garden doesn't have any food for someone that is allergic to onion. So I guess that's the last time for me.",

I could barely get thru my portion it was so generous, but so yummy I found that I couldn't stop eating long enough to take the remainder home.   I don't usually order an appetizer, but we had the calamari. Sadly, we could have done without it, frozen and way too much fried breading. Not horrible, just not very memorable either.  I wish I could remember our servers name, cuz she was GOOD. Shame on me, I'm usually better than that. Very attentive and after we finished each course she asked if we wanted more (i.e. soup, breadsticks) and our drinking glasses remained full without us having to ask.  This place also usually has good discounts & coupons available in local media and online, which can always be helpful.",

I even had to ask which of the the two globs was lasagna.  The chicken parmesan was dry and crispy around the edges, the portions were minuscule, but they sure put a big glob of fettuccine in the middle to try and make it look filling (I never eat the fettuccine, as it's usually meh, preferring the lasagna and chicken, but this time the fettuccine looked the best. Still didn't eat it.  Not sure how the wife's food was, but for $70, it would have had to be gold.",

Absolutely vile.     And the service equalled the food.  Just pathetic.  Hour and half for lunch midweek. The manager was as clueless as the waiter.  I cannot express in words how absolutely awful this place is.   Clueless service and disgusting food.  No one was smiling like in their commercials.  The most awful chain restaurant.  Beware.

After being seated we were given menus and waited... And waited... And waited some more. After 10 minutes of sitting down without anyone even taking a drink order, the waitress came back to our area and didn't even acknowledge us. She tended to the large group never to us, and never even made eye contact. After being there 15 minutes I suggested we leave the restaurant. We waited another couple mins, and we left. Never got food, drinks, or even talked to anyone besides the host who sat us.   I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I've never been in a restaurant that slow, and not been served.   I would post a picture but I didn't even get a glass of water in the the near 20 minutes we sat there. No one aside from the host even said a word. And when I left, not a single member of the staff said anything to us as we walked out.   There are plenty of other restaurants in the area to go to. Take your pick, you'll get better service. The service here was so bad I'll never go back.",

As far as the entrees go, the chicken was tender and juicy (goes really well with the angel-hair pasta). The spicy shrimp was kind of bland (although a featured item on the menu!).

So, I saw they had a smaller lunch portion for about $12 here.  So I decided to eat here.  I don't mind Olive Garden.  It's not my favorite Italian joint, but there are MUCH worse.  The salad is always worth the trip.  I normally like the breadsticks, but given I got there around 2pm today, I guess they weren't that fresh.  They were a little stale.  The salad and lasagna both did not disappoint.  They were great.  And I had a $3 Birra Morretti (A great Italian beer).  So, with tip I had a great meal for under $20.  And my server was beyond spectacular.  She was fast, attentive, and very friendly.  It was a great dining experience.  Now, if the powers that be there are listening, please bring back the Manicotti.  It was my favorite dish on the menu.",

I got home, and my food wasn't fresh. I've ordered from Olive Garden several times and never experienced such bad pasta. It tasted like it's been sitting out for hours. I wasn't concerned about the temperature of the food as I was a bit late picking it up. The fettuccini noodles were so hard and chewy as if they were undercooked. The sauce was so thick and bland. My breadsticks were hard but that was expected because again I was late. Thankfully my salad was fresh. I'm pretty sure my food is old due to closing time at 11pm which was just unacceptable. I contacted a supervisor on duty, \"Long Dang\", I explained the issue and in the beginning he asked several unrelated questions as I did provide my order number and first and last name, which should be an easy find because this order was placed online. He then told me, my food was old because I was late picking it up and claim they've contacted me several times which him and I both know is bullshit. I don't have the best service but I know when someone calls, anyways he tried covering for his employees which is normal I guess. After   he offered to remake the pasta, I declined because at this point you've made me feel uncomfortable and I am not interested in ever eating at this location again. I told Long I will bring in the food and would like a refund. He agreed and apologized. Long seemed genuine by the end of the conversation. He assured I would receive a full refund and I did not have to bring in the food. I will give 3 stars because the situation was handled professionally and this is by far one of my favorite restaurants although I've received old food at this location. I suggest if you're ordering from this location to dine in for fresh food.",

The \"create a pasta dish of rigatoni, meat sauce and Italian sausage was served.  But my Italian sausage was meatballs.  I told the server (not my waitress) I had ordered Italian sausage.  Into,d him it was no big deal and the meatballs would be fine.  This server left and as I was finished my meal he showed up with a side of Italian sausage.  At the time I thought that they had tried to make it right and I appreciated the gesture.  This earned them a 20% tip.  I had the receipt emailed to me.  Later I came across the receipt on my email and was reviewing the ala carter type billing.  Guess what I find?  Italian sausage listed three times at $1.79 each.  So long story short.  They brought me the wrong meal and charged me to fix it.  Good bye Olive Garden and I will not be back.",

I wanted to find a decent Italian restaurant on the strip or hit a buffet, but my friend was hell bent on finding an Old Spaghetti Factory somewhere in Nevada.  Whip out the trusty iPhone and there's supposedly a restaurant 8 miles away in Henderson and she's willing to drive us there. We go to the supposed location and it doesn't exist, go to a nearby mall and discover there's no such thing as an Old Spaghetti Factory in Nevada so what do we do?  And what's the next best option?  Olive Garden.  It's convenient.  It's close and it'll be too late to get dinner and go to bed at a reasonable hour if we try to eat on the strip.  I shudder at the thought of it but agree.  I'm staying a few extra nights so I can make up for it later.    The redeeming qualities about this experience are the quick and friendly staff, virtually no wait time since we're out in the middle of nowhere, and a complementary tasting of the Moscato Castello del Poggio.  This was a light effervescent white wine with hints of peach.  Very refreshing and sweet and possibly a new favorite.    Our meals were average and sub par.  My bellini peach iced tea was too sweet and the mushroom ravioli was dry and overcooked and hard to chew.  The bread and pasta weren't bad but I still would have preferred to go elsewhere.  Olive Garden is a little too pricey for the food they serve and next year, we'll be finding something on the strip.",

    "text": "This would be 1 star had Andrew our waiter had not tried to correct the service failure. After hour being seated we actually watched table across from us be seated after us eat pay bill and leave before we even received our main course. Ordering never ending pasta bowl one would think that is pretty pre made basic stuff they have available to serve. Andrew advised kitchen was having issues and basically reason for problem. Manager Tanya was nice however offers a coupon for free appetizer next time we come and dessert free to take home. Would have preferred discount off meal after spending 2 hrs there. We did have 5.00 off coupon that was not applied to bill, after being up since 3am to go to work and 2 hrs in OG was willing pay bill get out and go home @6:30pm. Thanks Andrew for trying to make up we appreciated it, however OG will be long time before our feet will step foot in your establishment.",

I noticed that they have cut their portion sizes in half... and the alfredo sauce is always inconsistant, sometimes it taste like they water it down instead of using the real ingredients...maybe to cut costs?? My husband took me there for valentines day and my alfredo sauce tasted like it was burnt. Not sure I will be going back there anytime soon......I think I'm going to start looking for a new favorite italian place to eat at!",

I was attempting to plan a nice evening at home with my wife and wanted to place an order for a To Go meal.  I tried for over an hour to contact them by phone and there was no answer and there is no internet ordering option..  I double checked the number with the Olive Garden website and it was correct.",

    "text": "Major props to this olive garden location. Came here with my fiancee on a Friday night. Yeah it was a little crowded but they got us in pretty darn quick. My date is visually impaired and has a guide dog and so I was majorly impressed by how the hostess, our server, and everyone in the restaurant respected and treated them. They pulled away a chair so the dog could lay at the table, they would always let my date know what and where things were being set, and seemed to do everything imaginable to make it a wonderful experience. Even with a busy restaurant our food came hot and fast and given a great amount of attention for all the customers there. We both tried the 4 cheese panchiettas which were really really good. I had the sausage and could only eat half - it was even better the next day!  I'll definitely keep coming back to  this Olive Garden location. Good service in this town can sometimes be hard to find but credit goes to Olive Garden to making their employees realize how important it can be!",

    "text": "Ok so there are 2 reasons why I'm writing this review.   1. I love lasagna. I'm seriously Garfield's long lost human sister.   2. Creepy people make me go into uncontrollable rambling fits.   I know some people may be offended by this, but I LOVE Olive Garden. I know, I know it's not \"real\" Italian food. I don't care. I love it and you can't stop me. Not to mention, they never look at me all crazy when I walk in there with my ripped jeans and/or ripped t-shirt, my hair a mess in a pony tail, and sporting my rockstar sunglasses because it's way too f-ing bright outside (thanks Vegas heat!). I'm sure I look like I have been living on the street for a week but they don't care. They are always polite and the wait is never long.   After we are seated, I just sit and impatiently wait for the person I'm with to figure out what they want. I never browse the menu because I get the same thing every time, can you guess what it is? =) So then the waiter or waitress comes by and we order quickly. Sorry waiters and waitresses of the world, but I am the quiet order-er. I can't help it, but to make up for it I will point to what I want on the menu so if you can't hear me, at least (hopefully) you can read. Also, I don't want you f-ing up my order. I do this because I'm shy and if, by chance, I can't pronounce it.. I don't want to sound like a speak n spell.   I'm a people watcher so I spend a lot of time looking at other people in the restaurant and the employees there. I will usually find someone interesting and make up their life story. Yes, I'm easily amused. The waiter/waitress will bring out bread sticks and I will proceed to hoard them and keep them for my own.. unless the person I'm with is very persuasive. So we get our food, which is always the same and always good. That's when it happens...   The manager or whatever starts lurking around the tables, watching people eat and looking for his prey. I don't like to be observed like an animal at feeding time, so I carefully track him throughout the meal. Always careful to never make eye contact and slightly slouch down in my seat to avoid detection. Why am I doing this you may ask.. because if I don't, he will make a beeline straight for our table and start asking how things were and blah blah blah. I can appreciate the fact that leadership or managers want to make sure their business is doing well but here its all so FAKE. Every guy at every Olive Garden who is concerned how they are doing is fake fake fake fake fakey mcfakerson. It annoys the crap out of me and since I can't even put my big girl voice on to order, I definitely don't want to talk to them! It just comes off as creepy, like someone just put in fresh batteries and so they are all juiced up with fakeness. I usually remain silent at this point and let my poor dining partner fend for themselves. Sorry, but now you have been warned.   Basically what I'm saying is stop being a creepy fake. Don't stalk me while I'm eating and don't talk to me unless you are trying to pump me full of bread sticks!",

    "text": "My husband and I were waiting to be seated.  We noticed that people that came in after us were being seated first.  My husband approaced the two people in charge of seating and asked him why this was so.  The young African American female seater told my hunsband he was being hostile.  My husband was a bit taken aback and said he was not being hotile and the girl then proceeded to address the waiting area as if addressing an audience and said in a loud voice to my husband, \"don't you yell at me!\"  I then stood up from my seat and said to her that he was not yelling at him.  She refused to seat us and her companion seater then led us to a table and was apologizing profusely and also acknowledged that we were not yelling at the girl and had no idea why she was acting the way she was.  The manager also came and after hearing our side of the story offered us his apologies and a free appetizer.  We were starting to calm down but not too long after, I saw the same girl seating a group near us and she gave me a haughty look.  I will not return to that restaurant ever again and am tweeting the experience.",

The server was so unhelpful that he ruined our experience. He was no where to be found most of the time, and when he was around he walked like a snail. I don't remember his name because he never introduced himself, but he is short with black hair, and quite frankly is not suited to be a server. Luckly for us the food was good (when we finally got it). Do not reccommend this location however.",
